BACKGROUND
abscission is a coordinated process tightly regulated by the interplay of several factors, among which auxin and ethylene play a pivotal role  <cit> . leaf deblading and ethylene application lead to premature abscission of the organ due to the disruption of the auxin flux and activation of the abscission zone  at the base of the petiole  <cit> .

in the commonly accepted model, as demonstrated in the arabidopsis etr1- <dig>  ethylene coordinates abscission. in this mutant, flower abscission is significantly delayed because the ethylene receptor  is hampered in ethylene binding activity, leading to partial ethylene insensitivity. although ethylene accelerates abscission, it is strictly not necessary for shedding, indicating that a very complex interplay of events control the process  <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that ethylene-dependent and -independent pathways converge in determining flower abscission  <cit> .

it has also been postulated that prevention of abscission requires a continuous and constant auxin transport through the az  <cit> . besides preventing abscission, auxin regulates a tremendous number of processes, for instance root meristem activity, organogenesis, and vascular tissue differentiation  <cit> . only recently the outstanding complex mode of action of auxin has been partially unraveled  <cit> . the most common auxin in plant, indol-3-acetic acid , binds and is perceived by tir <dig>  an f-box protein  <cit> . tir <dig> interacts in the scf complex to bring about the degradation of aux/iaa transcriptional regulators  <cit> . these proteins are active repressors of auxin responsive genes and are encoded by a large multigene family  <cit> . auxin applications enhance the transcript amount of most of the aux/iaas in several species  <cit> . another enthralling field concerns auxin transport  <cit> , which can be classified as either polar  or non polar. however, the pat is acquiring ever-growing interest and may be the most important means of auxin relocation  <cit> . iaa is taken up into the cell by a combination of lipophilic diffusion, symport via aux and lax  permeases, and atp-dependent transport by a p-glycoprotein  <cit> . auxin export is mediated by pin-formed  facilitators and by atp activated pgps   <cit> . pins and pgps were shown to characterize coordinated and independent auxin transport mechanisms, and function interactively in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . nevertheless, the function of the pgps is non-specific and mainly applies to auxin excess  <cit> . as a matter of fact, it is the asymmetric cellular localization of pin proteins that determines the direction of the auxin flow  <cit> . although different pins are implicated in specific developmental processes, there seems to be redundancy as indicated by the ectopic expression of pin proteins in some mutant combinations  <cit> .

the modes of action of auxin and ethylene elucidated in a. thaliana have been extended to other model species such as tomato  <cit> . yet, little is known about the interactions between these two hormones during abscission induction of organs other than debladed leaves or senescing flowers. in particular, the apple cluster during the immature fruit drop represents an ideal system to study the shedding of actively growing organs  <cit> . at this developmental stage, the shedding process involves almost exclusively lateral fruitlets in which abscission is preceded by an increase in ethylene biosynthesis and sensitivity  <cit> . according to the correlative basis reknown model the central fruitlet exerts a dominant effect over lateral fruitlets because it is at a more advanced stage of development  <cit> . as assessed by the canalization theory the strong auxin flow coming from the central fruitlet, down to the peduncle through the az into the twig, depolarizes the weak auxin flows from the lateral fruitlets causing their abscission  <cit> .

apical dominance is a complex physiological process largely controlled by auxin and its interaction with two additional hormones: cytokinins and max  whose sink strength is related to their ability in producing and exporting auxin  <cit> . this process directs more cytokinins which stimulate growth  <cit> . in the case of apical dominance of shoot meristems, lateral bud outgrowth occurs when the auxin flow from the apex is hampered, dominance is weakened, and cytokinins are redirected to axillary meristems  <cit> . besides the main cytokinin stream coming from the roots, the hormone can also be produced in other tissues. for instance, following decapitation, a prompt increase in transcripts for the key enzyme in cytokinin biosynthesis, adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase, occurs in the stem xylem  <cit> . the cytokinins produced here may then be translocated into the axillary meristems where they stimulate the lateral bud outgrowth. the cytokinin signaling relies on a two-component signal transduction system and upon activation it determines changes in transcript level of genes encoding proteins, such as the same cytokinin response regulators  which are involved in various processes  <cit> .

the second hormone which interacts with auxin is max, a carotenoid derived compound which has been only recently characterized as strigolactone, but its existence had been proven before by the discovery of the pea rms, petunia dad and a. thaliana max mutants  <cit> . these plants display excessive branching, indicating that strigolactone is a positive regulator of apical dominance. among the several genes related to this hormone, atmax <dig> encodes an f-box protein  <cit> . although the f-box protein is not required for the synthesis of max it is involved in the transduction of the signal at the level of the node  <cit> .

the isolation, characterization and expression of some genes encoding elements involved in auxin transport, as well as of type a mdarrs and mdmax <dig>  were pursued to elucidate at the molecular level the interactions among ethylene, pat and cytokinin in relation to the immature apple fruit abscission,

RESULTS
identification of elements involved in pat in malusxdomestica
during a differential display study between abscising and not abscising fruitlet populations, several clones related to auxin were isolated. however, only two transporters were found: with one encoding an auxin hydrogen symporter whereas the other one was too short and located in a highly conserved region which made further studies complicated  <cit> . we then pursued the isolation of other elements involved in auxin transport by the amplification of fruitlet cdnas with degenerate primers and the following 3' race. this approach allowed the identification of seven pin  and three lax  partial clones. the name was chosen according to the highest level of similarity with the pin of a. thaliana and m. truncatula, two dicotyledonous species whose members have all been well characterized at the genomic level. mdpin1_a  mdpin1_b , mdpin10_a , and mdpin10_b  are likely to be orthologous to atpin <dig>  whereas mdpin7_a , mdpin7_b , and mdpin <dig>  may be orthologous to atpin <dig>  atpin <dig> or atpin <dig> . nevertheless, this association has to be definitely proven by functional and synteny studies. the isolation of different alleles  and the fact that mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> are different genes and not allelic forms was ascertained by the isolation and comparison of the genomic clones . the amplification of the genomic clones allowed the identification of the third, fourth and fifth intron as indicated in the work by  <cit> . the comparison of these regions indicated that the third intron was identical among the three clones whereas the fourth one was identical only between mdpin10_a and mdpin10_b. the fifth intron was the most divergent, but the identity between the two alleles of mdpin <dig> was still  <dig> % . concerning the lax genes, mdlax <dig>  may be orthologous to ataux <dig>  whereas mdlax <dig>  and mdlax <dig>  are more divergent and closer to atlax .

since fruitlets are actively growing organs and auxins install apical dominance by directing the cytokinin stream derived from the root, some elements involved in cytokinin signal transduction were also isolated. these clones showed a high level of similarity to type a response regulators  of several species  and were named according to the most closely related atarr: mdarr <dig> , mdarr <dig>  and mdarr <dig> .

expression analysis in the different tissues
the rt- pcr expression analysis performed with 33p labeled degenerate primers visualized the relative level of expression among the different pin genes. the high intensity of the band of mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> indicates that the transcripts of these genes are largely predominant on mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> . this result was also confirmed by the number of cycles used in the rt-pcr: on average, mdpin <dig> expression was studied at  <dig> cycles, mdpin <dig> at  <dig> cycles, mdpin <dig> at  <dig> cycles and mdpin <dig> at  <dig> cycles . results showed a differential expression of the orthologs . mdlax <dig> transcripts accumulated in all the tissues, although the signal was barely detectable in fruit seed and senescing leaf. mdlax <dig> and mdlax <dig> transcripts showed a similar pattern: in the seedlings the transcripts accumulated mainly in root and hypocotyl, whereas in fruit mainly in cortex. the transcripts were also abundant in the flower. transcripts decreased during leaf ageing . transcripts were also detected in shoot, whereas in fruitlet, the highest amount was observed in peduncle. mdpin <dig> transcripts displayed a similar pattern to mdlax <dig>  with the signal slightly decreasing during flower and leaf senescence. mdpin <dig> transcripts were mainly detected in seedlings grown in dark, above all in hypocotyl and peduncle; the transcripts slightly decreased along senescence of both flower and leaf. mdpin <dig> displayed a pattern similar to mdpin <dig>  except in the flower where the signal was strong and apparently not affected by ageing. mdpin <dig> transcripts were detected in all organs, with a slight increase in the seedlings grown in dark compared to those grown in light, and during flower senescence, whereas a decrease was observed in senescing leaf. mdiaa <dig> transcripts were present in all tissues at similar level, whereas mdiaa <dig> transcripts displayed a decrease during both flower and leaf senescence, and a weaker signal in seed than in peduncles and cortex. the strongest mdmax <dig> signal was observed in cotyledons of light grown seedlings and in seeds of ripe and immature fruits. furthermore, the transcripts accumulated preferentially in shoots rather than in fully expanded and senescing leaves. besides fruit cortex and leaf, mdarr <dig> transcript accumulation pattern was the opposite to that of mdmax <dig>  with the signal decreasing in senescing flower and leaf. the mdarr <dig> signal, although weak in all tissues, was mainly detected in the root of light grown seedlings. in the other tissues, transcripts mainly accumulated in leaf. mdarr <dig> transcripts accumulated preferentially in dark grown seedling and, opposite to mdarr <dig>  transcript amount decreased along leaf ageing.

expression analysis during abscission induction
mdpin <dig> transcript amount displayed a dramatic decrease in seeds whereas not much difference was observed in the other tissues . mdpin <dig> transcripts increased in cortex by day  <dig> with a concurrent slight decrease in peduncle, whereas in az the decrease started already at day  <dig>  mdpin <dig> transcripts increased throughout the experiment in cortex, whereas in peduncle the increase was moderate and started later, concurrently with a decrease in az. mdpin <dig> expression showed only a late increase in cortex. mdlax <dig> transcripts slightly declined in seeds and increased in both cortex and peduncles. in az a transient decrease was observed at day  <dig>  since mdlax <dig> and mdlax <dig> showed the same pattern of expression, only results related to mdlax <dig> are presented in figure  <dig>  besides a slight transient decrease at day  <dig> in peduncle and a late surge in cortex, transcript levels remained unchanged along the experiment. mdiaa <dig> transcripts decreased by day  <dig> in seeds and increased by day  <dig> and  <dig> in peduncles and cortex, respectively. mdiaa <dig> transcript amount significantly increased in cortex at day  <dig> along with a dramatic decrease in peduncles. mdarr <dig> mrna amount steadily increased in cortex, whereas in seeds and peduncles a decrease was observed at day  <dig>  analogously, mdarr <dig> transcripts increased in cortex and decreased in seeds and slightly in peduncles. concerning mdarr <dig>  mrna amount already increased in cortex at day  <dig>  then remained constant. mdmax <dig> transcripts decreased late in seeds and increased at day  <dig> in cortex. the up-regulation was maintained in the following dates: in peduncle a transient decreased at day  <dig> and  <dig> was observed whereas in az mrna gradually declined along the experiment.

peduncle development
peduncle growth was monitored along abscission up to  <dig> days after ba application . the length of the naf peduncles was significantly shorter than the af along the whole experiment. the initial length of the peduncles, according to the value of the intercepts calculated by a linear regression, was  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm for naf and af, respectively. on the other hand, according to the line equations , the growth rate of the fruitlet peduncle was similar with values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. concerning diameter, the naf was characterized by a thicker peduncle  than the af , but no relevant changes were observed along the experiment.

auxin effect on pin transcripts
auxin application determined a dose-dependent response in pin transcripts. nevertheless, there was a clear increase only in mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig>  whereas in the case of mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> auxin application seemed only to counteract the natural decrease in transcripts as observed in the mock control .

ethylene effect on transcript accumulation
fruitlet clusters were flushed with propylene or treated with 1-mcp for  <dig> hours and expression analysis was carried out in peduncles . compared to the control, mdlax <dig>  mdlax <dig>  mdpin <dig>  mdpin <dig>  mdarr <dig> and mdarr <dig> transcript amount was decreased by propylene and increased by 1-mcp, especially in the case of mdpin <dig>  as far as mdpin <dig>  mdpin <dig> and mdmax <dig> are concerned, the transcripts accumulated throughout the experiment in an ethylene-independent manner, whereas no chemical effect was observed on mdarr <dig> transcripts.

discussion
which are the orthologs?
the isolation of various pin and lax clones in malus × domestica indicates the presence of multigene families. because of the identical expression profile and the high identity values, mdlax <dig> and mdlax <dig> are likely to be alleles. on the contrary, the alignment of the pins presented here with the pins of a. thaliana and m. truncatula, the isolation of the two genomic alleles of mdpin <dig> and the differences at the level of the introns, and expression pattern of mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> indicate that they may be paralogous, as it has been reported for mtpin <dig> and mtpin <dig>  <cit> . the same organization was found in vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa and oryza sativa. interestingly, a. thaliana presents a transcript variation of the pin <dig> gene . another interesting point is that mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> are closely related to each other as found for mtpin <dig> and mtpin <dig>  whereas in a. thaliana, besides atpin <dig> and atpin <dig>  a third member, atpin <dig>  is present in the same cluster. the overall data indicate a different organization of the pin members in the species discussed here. similar organization for this cluster was found in populus and vitis but not in oryza . this may be due to duplication and specialization of the members along plant speciation after p. patens. the organization of the auxin influx carriers was not completely conserved either  this observation also highlights the difficulty in identifying the physiological orthologs of arabidopsis genes.

the expression of the pat elements is driven by external and internal cues
during germination when a young plant has to grow through the soil particles and reach the surface, the cotyledons remain upright and the hypocotyl keeps on elongating until it reaches the light. the difference between hypocotyl length of seedlings grown in dark and seedlings during de-etiolation was also observed in our experiment . expression analysis performed on the seedlings indicated that light mainly affects transcript amount of the auxin efflux carriers  in hypocotyl as reported in pea, whereas the influx carrier transcript quantity was barely changed   <cit> . according to the results, light negatively regulates pin expression during germination. considering the expression domains of the arabidopsis pins at this stage the expression level at different developmental stages and in different organs, and the sequence similarity to known proteins and genes, mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> analogously to atpin <dig>  would be involved in pat directed to the root apical meristems <cit> . on the other hand, mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig>  similarly to atpin <dig> and atpin <dig>  may have an important role in hypocotyl elongation because they are expressed in hypocotyl epidermis and bundle sheath. however, immunolocalization and gfp studies are necessary to further investigate which elements in apple are the physiological orthologs to those of arabidopsis.

moreover, a general decrease in the transcript amount of mdlax <dig>  mdlax <dig>  mdlax <dig>  mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> was observed during senescence and ageing of different organs/tissues such as seed, leaf, flower and cortex. as discussed above, it is well known that a drop in auxin level occurs during leaf senescence preceding abscission. it has also been extensively demonstrated that the majority of aux/iaa transcripts increase after auxin application in several systems, making them good molecular markers for the auxin endogenous level  <cit> . furthermore, analogously to the pin clones herein isolated, transcripts of some pins were found to increase following auxin application in poplar, pea and a. thaliana  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that the change in mdiaa <dig> and pin transcripts occurring at certain developmental stages is at least partially auxin-related. on the other hand, the clone mdiaa <dig> may represent a gene that is highly expressed and only partially controlled by auxin. in addition, a slight increase in mdlax <dig>  mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> transcripts was monitored in senescing flowers, as reported during daffodil flower senescence  <cit> . these results indicate that the expression of the pat elements, besides being under auxin control, is developmentally and tissue specifically regulated, as previously reported for hybrid aspen and a. thaliana, respectively  <cit> .

pat transcripts are differentially regulated during abscission induction
the expression analysis performed along abscission induction pointed out a general increase in the transcription of pat elements in cortex, whereas a predominant decrease was observed in seeds. furthermore, considering that mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> are the most abundant transcripts  and that mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> were not detected in seed, it appears that during the fruitlet abscission a decrease in pat at the level of the seed occurs. on the other hand, the low growth rate  <cit>  and the high level of pat transcripts, such as mdiaa <dig> and mdiaa <dig>  observed in the cortex of af, indicate a delay in development. this hypothesis is strengthened by the up-regulation of mdarr <dig>  mdarr <dig> and mdarr <dig> occurring in the cortex of af. in fact, the type a arr is the best indicator of the level of the cytokinin , in which this phenomenon occurs in fruit exclusively at early development.

the cellular concentration of auxin is due to both transport rate and homeostasis, but in the wood forming tissues, the latter is largely predominant on synthesis, catabolism and conjugation due to the scarce capacity of the cells  <cit> . the peduncle and the az are mainly made up of this type of cells. different patterns were found in transcripts accumulation: mdpin <dig> decreased in peduncles and in the az, whereas mdpin <dig> increased in peduncle and decreased in az, indicating a different nature of the tissues. we may hypothesize that during abscission induction the decrease in auxin flow coming from the seeds determines a change in the peduncle both in terms of auxin level, as assessed by the mdiaa <dig> transcript accumulation and in terms of pat, because peduncle is the fruitlet organ in which mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> are mostly expressed and that the diverse pin mutants display partially different phenotypes . the vertical flux may be hampered due to an increase in the apolar distributed efflux carriers. in this scheme, the auxin flow through the az will progressively decrease, leading to az activation. nevertheless, auxin at this stage may play a pivotal role in tissue differentiation leading to wood formation  <cit> , as demonstrated by the isolation of auxin related clones putatively involved in the process  <cit> . in this case, the auxin flow may be directed, according to the signal flow canalization hypothesis  <cit> , through a lateral transport mediated by specifically localized aecs such as mdpin <dig>  the difference in development between af and naf is further confirmed by the higher level of mdlax <dig> transcripts and by the reduced diameter of the lateral fruitlet peduncle. in agreement to what was observed for the hypocotyls during de-etiolation, the differential expression may also be related to a higher elongation rate. nevertheless, despite the fact that af peduncles are longer than naf, there was no difference in the growth rate, thus indicating that the differential expression is unrelated to cell elongation but mainly related to tissue formation. concerning az, the transient decrease in mdlax <dig> and the continuous decrease in mdpin <dig> and mdpin <dig> transcripts may indicate a redistribution of auxin.

abscission induction and dominance
abscission in apple is proposed to be due to competition between auxin flows coming from the different fruitlets in a dominance-like fashion  <cit> . the data herein presented indicate that during abscission induction there is a clear decrease in pat-related transcripts in the seed, the key element in fruitlet dominance. it is then likely that the drop in auxin export capacity of af leads to a weak auxin flow which cannot compete with the strong flux from the central fruitlet. as previously discussed, dominance is related to the capacity of the apex to attract cytokinins, which are positive regulators of type a arr expression. indeed, a decrease in mdarr <dig> and mdarr <dig> transcripts was observed in seeds during abscission induction, thus indicating a shortage in cytokinin. nevertheless, the low level of cytokinin is likely due to a low biosynthetic rate rather than to a reduced import. it has been shown that there are several ipt genes expressed at specific stages of seed development  <cit>  and there is a specific developmental window during seed formation in which a large increase in seed cytokinin is observed in cereals and beans  <cit> . at this stage, cytokinins are believed to strengthen sink activity and to induce endosperm proliferation. furthermore, the chalazal endosperm is thought to be involved in importing assimilates into the developing seeds  <cit> . since cytokinins in seed are not exported, it is likely that they play a role as local mediators rather than systemic signals  <cit> . considering max <dig>  an additional element involved in apical dominance, its expression pattern in the different tissues is opposite to that of mdlax2/ <dig>  mdarr <dig> and mdpin <dig>  especially in seedlings. this divergence may indicate some common regulatory mechanisms in terms of transcription. nevertheless, such relation is lacking in the tissues undergoing abscission, indicating that mdmax <dig> may not play an important function in pin regulation as reported in other systems but instead act in other processes such as senescence  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
it appears that the expression level of genes related to auxin and the pat elements are tightly correlated to abscission induction driven by dominance in apple. it is feasible that the strong auxin flow characterizing the central fruitlet dominates the weak ones  <cit> . nevertheless, it is not clear what is the cue determining the fall in the seed pat that triggers abscission. the best candidate is development, which is also affected by carbohydrate availability  <cit> . the developmental stage acts through the same auxin flow  and with the likely involvement of ethylene. indeed, ethylene has already been proven to affect auxin transport  <cit> . in this study, ethylene was also clearly shown to repress transcript accumulation of mdlax <dig>  mdlax <dig>  mdpin <dig>  mdpin <dig>  mdarr <dig> and mdarr <dig>  indicating that the increase in its evolution at this stage may modulate seed development, leading to a reduced auxin export and the induction of abscission.
