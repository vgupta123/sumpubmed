BACKGROUND
among the most severe environmental challenges to confront animals is the low oxygen availability of high-altitude regions such as the tibetan plateau, which is at an elevation above  <dig>  m. the partial pressure of oxygen at  <dig>  m is only approximately 50 % of the value at sea-level, and the resultant hypoxia imposes severe constraints on aerobic metabolism and leads to high-altitude illness . thus the mechanisms of hypoxic adaptation have become of great interest in recent years. genome-wide scans and whole genome re-sequencing analysis for identifying selection signatures of high-altitude adaptation have been performed across a wide range of species, including human , dog  <cit> , grey wolf  <cit> , yak  <cit> , tibetan antelope  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , pig  <cit> , and chicken  <cit> . although the convergent evolution between different species was reported in tibetan people, dog and grey wolf with the epas <dig>  gene as the common selected locus , in other species, distinct loci were revealed for high-altitude adaptation, suggesting that diverse molecular mechanisms may be employed.

cashmere goat has the broadest altitudinal range of all herbivores in mainland china  <cit> , as it is continuously distributed from sea level  to the tibetan plateau . as first recorded in  <dig> - <dig>  bc  <cit> , the tibetan cashmere goat exhibits phenotypic adaptation to the hypoxia conditions of the tibetan plateau under long-term natural and artificial selection  <cit> . pioneering work regarding the high-altitude adaptation of the tibetan cashmere goat mainly at the anatomical, biochemical, and physiological levels began two decades ago . these early studies showed that the tibetan goats and the f <dig> progeny of tibetan goats × imported liaoning cashmere goats  had stable inheritable adaptability to live in a high-altitude environment with some adaptive traits  <cit> . compared with the goats living at an altitude below  <dig>  m, the tibetan goats maintained higher adult haemoglobin  concentrations, heavier heart and lungs, and lower heart rates . therefore, the tibetan cashmere goat provides an outstanding model for understanding the genetic mechanism of hypoxia adaptation and hypoxia-related disease development. however, the molecular mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic adaptation to the high-altitude environment remains largely unknown.

our previous studies regarding the chinese cashmere goat, based on markers from both mitochondrial dna and microsatellites , showed a high level of genetic differentiation between the tibetan cashmere goat and other cashmere goat breeds  <cit> . hence, we speculated that the tibetan cashmere goat carries unique adaptive alleles for the high-altitude environment  <cit>  that have never been identified due to the limited number of polymorphic markers. the development of next-generation sequencing and the release of the first goat reference genome assembly  <cit>  offer us a great opportunity to investigate the genetic differentiation among goat breeds in a high-throughput method. here, we extended our previous analyses with high-throughput sequencing of exome-captured genomic dna to detect the genetic variation of six major chinese cashmere goat populations . we then conducted a genome-wide screen for the selection signatures at the exome regions in two high-altitude tibetan cashmere goat populations  by comparing these populations with the four lowland breeds  to identify the possible molecular basis of the high-altitude adaptation . this study is the first comprehensive analysis of the population genetic differentiation in chinese indigenous cashmere goats and detection of the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypic adaptation of tibetan cashmere goats.table  <dig> information about samples collected from chinese cashmere goats at different altitudes

RESULTS
exome sequencing of the pooled samples
we sequenced six pools of captured exomes from goats living at different altitudes  using a hiseq  <dig> platform, resulting in 50– <dig> million raw reads and 89- to 163-fold coverage for each pool . we aligned the reads to the reference genome of the domestic goat  and estimated the allele frequencies for all  <dig>  snps identified by our snp calling pipeline as described in the methods section. in total,  <dig>  autosomal snps were used in the downstream analysis. a strong correlation was observed between the sequence-based allele frequency and individual genotyping allele frequency estimates in each population , indicating that our strategy of dna pooling and exome capture was quite effective for estimating the allele frequency of the snps in the exome region at the population level.

genetic diversity analysis
the proportion of polymorphic loci and the average heterozygosity ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % and from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, respectively, with the lowest heterozygosity value in ln and the highest heterozygosity in cdm , indicating the lowest diversity in ln and the highest in cdm. a phylogenetic tree based on all snps showed a clear separation among all populations . the topology structure of the tree was consistent with that of our previous result based on the mitochondrial dna and microsatellite markers from the same cashmere breeds  <cit> . the two tibetan cashmere populations, bg and rt, formed one branch and differed greatly from other cashmere breeds. in the main branch of the lowland breeds, ln and nj populations were grouped together, while cdm and im were genetically distinct. among all the branches of the tree, cdm had the shortest branch and ln had the longest one, which corresponded to the highest diversity in cdm and the lowest diversity in ln, consistent with the heterozygosity analysis .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis and fst simulation test. a phylogenetic tree analysis based on all markers. b cumulative distribution of observed and simulated  fst values. c histogram of fst values in the simulated and observed datasets . d phylogenetic tree based on those global snps showing significant genetic differentiation



because both natural selection and artificial selection have shaped the goat genomes and because genetic adaptations can occur due to many different variables, we first focused on the genetic differentiation in a global scenario to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the selection patterns among all six populations. we estimated the global fst for each identified snp, and this estimation was termed the global fst analysis. to evaluate the population diversity we calculated the average genetic differentiation coefficient , the average overall genetic diversity  and the average diversity within a population , which were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this calculation indicated that only  <dig>  % of the total genetic diversity was partitioned among breeds and that most of the variability  was within populations .

global fst analysis reveals regions under selection across six populations
to elucidate whether the observed genetic differentiation is primarily driven by drift or selection, a simulation test was conducted. the simulation was based on six subpopulations, each with an effective population size of  <dig>  individuals who had been separated for  <dig>  generations, and on the average simulated fst, which was identical to that observed in our global fst dataset . generally, the simulated data were consistent with the observed data . more than half  of the loci had fst values less than  <dig> ; however, a significant number of loci  had extreme fst values in the observed data compared with the simulation . only  <dig> loci in the observed data had fst values greater than  <dig> , whereas none was found in the simulated data. furthermore,  <dig>  % of the loci in the observed data  had fst values greater than  <dig> , whereas the corresponding value in the simulated data were  <dig>  % . thus, approximately 2-3 % of the loci in our exome re-sequencing data showed greater genetic differentiation than expected under a selectively neutral model. therefore, a threshold of the top  <dig>  % was used to search for the loci under selection, and  <dig>  snps, which overlapped with  <dig> genes, were found in the global fst analysis.

gene ontology  analysis of the  <dig> genes revealed  <dig> significantly enriched go categories. among these categories, the most significantly enriched go categories were cell adhesion , regulation of molecular function  and multicellular organismal development  . we also found some interesting go categories, such as response to external stimulus , response to cell communication involved in cardiac conduction , blood vessel development , and circulatory system process , which may be related to adaptation the local environment adaptation.

genetic differentiation between the high- and low-altitude goat breeds
given that the bg and rt populations have adapted to a high-altitude environment for thousands of years, we sought to identify the candidate loci adaptive to high altitude. the phylogenetic tree that was built from the top  <dig>  % outlier snps of the global fst analysis showed a similar structure but with even clearer separation of the six goat populations  than the tree based on all snps . the new tree showed that the tibetan cashmere goat populations  became even more divergent from other lowland breeds ; however, the results were insufficient for determining whether the genetic differentiation resulted from high-altitude adaptation. therefore, we evaluated the levels of population differentiation of bg and rt from other breeds to identify the loci showing evidence of adaption specific to the tibetan goat using the statistic di  <cit>  and χ <dig> test . by combining the di  and χ <dig> test  as the high-lowland analysis, we obtained  <dig>  outlier snps that were genetically differentiated between highland and lowland goat populations .fig.  <dig> overlap of snps from the global snp dataset and high-lowland dataset



by comparing the candidate loci potentially under selection across all breeds to those genetically differentiated loci between highland and lowland populations, we identified  <dig> common snps that overlapped with  <dig> genes . go enrichment analysis with the  <dig> common genes showed a significant overrepresentation of the categories related to regulation of actin filament-based process , cell adhesion , regulation of molecular function , regulation of multicellular organismal process  and cardiac muscle cell action potential involved in contraction . of the  <dig> common genes,  <dig> candidate genes were previously associated with high-altitude adaptation  <cit>  and  <dig> were involved in cardiovascular system according to literature mining . further protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that many hypoxia-related genes or cardiovascular system-related genes were observed in the protein interaction network  . based on the protein-protein interaction network, we identified that the ‘hub’ genes were hypoxia and cardiovascular system-related genes, including sirtuin type  <dig> , intercellular cell adhesion molecule- <dig> , endothelin receptor type a , yamaguchi sarcoma viral-related oncogene homolog  <dig> , and plakoglobin  .table  <dig> functional gene categories enriched for the common snp dataset go id



go enrichment analysis was also conducted with the remaining  <dig> specific snps  from the global snp dataset only. interestingly, categories that were associated with the cellular component organization and biological adhesion were still significantly enriched, but the categories related to cardiovascular system were not . this finding indicated that genes in the categories of cellular component organization and biological adhesion were under selection among all goat breeds, whereas genes related to cardiovascular system were under selection in the high-altitude goat breeds.

the non-synonymous snps on epas <dig> is associated with the high-altitude adaptation in a larger goat population
after filtering out genes with  <dig> loc symbols, as many as  <dig> of  <dig> common snps were located at the protein-coding regions:  <dig>  at introns; three, at upstream regions;  <dig>  at untranslated regions ; and  <dig>  at the intergenic regions. among these  <dig> coding snps,  <dig> non-synonymous snps were found in  <dig> genes, with one to four snps per gene. among these  <dig> candidate genes, four genes, epas <dig>  ednra, sirt <dig> and ryanodine receptor  <dig> , are hypoxia-related genes according to a study by zhang  <cit>  . as many as  <dig> genes, including epas <dig>  ednra, sirt <dig>  ryr <dig>  desmoglein  <dig> , cardiomyopathy associated  <dig> , receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase eta , fut <dig>  heart development protein with egf-like domains  <dig> , tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type z polypeptide  <dig> , pas domain-containing serine/threonine kinase , sialic acid-binding ig-like lectin  <dig> sialoadhesin , niemann-pick disease type c <dig> gene-like  <dig>  and nestin , were previously reported to be associated with the cardiovascular system through literature mining . non-synonymous amino acid replacements were assigned to categories according to changes in different physicochemical properties  <cit> . of these genes, eight contain at least one relevant amino acid change that altered their physicochemical properties. these genes were epas <dig>  ptprj, ednra, fut <dig>  nes, npc1l <dig>  pask, and ptprz <dig> .

the epas <dig> gene was the first gene that drew our attention because it was involved in complex oxygen sensing and was significantly associated with high-altitude adaption in dog and human  <cit> . this gene’s non-synonymous snp , which was identified as a potential target for selection at high altitude, causes a gln 579-leu  mutation in the translated epas <dig> protein, based on genbank annotation . the major allele of this snp in high-altitude breeds is “t”, whereas the major allele in lowland breeds is the same as the reference allele “a”. interestingly, the increasing frequency of the variant allele “t” with the elevated altitude was confirmed in the extended goat populations, with rare frequency in lowland breeds , moderate frequency in midland breeds , but high frequency in highland breeds . in addition, this mutation occurred next to a well-defined protein domain . to further evaluate the functional significance of this variant, we aligned the mutant epas <dig> protein with its ortholog proteins in seventeen different vertebrates . the comparison revealed that q579l mutated an evolutionary conserved amino acid, which is invariant among all the terrestrial animals that we examined. statistical analysis of the blood test results in for the bg population revealed a statistically significant association between the genotype and the mean corpuscular hb concentration  . all these results implied that epas <dig> plays a critical role in high-altitude adaptation in the chinese indigenous cashmere goat.fig.  <dig>

the second candidate gene is ptprj , which is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase  family and which is present in all hematopoietic lineages  <cit> . mutations in this gene can lead to defects in vascular development  <cit> . six outlier snps were located in the ptprj gene; one in the 3’-utr and five in the coding region. of these five snps, four were non-synonymous, and three snps changed the physicochemical properties of the amino acid residues. however, multi-species alignment of the non-synonymous substitutions encoded in the ptprj genes showed that none of these four non-synonymous snps were present at evolutionary conserved sites. surprisingly, the same type of snps occurred in the npc1l <dig>  ptprz <dig>  nes, and pask gene. for the ednra and fut <dig>  the non-synonymous substitutions were present at extremely evolutionary conserved sites; however, the variants in ednra and fut <dig> did not present increased allele frequencies in different goat populations as the altitude increased. therefore, no further validation was conducted on these genes .

discussion
genetic diversity among the chinese cashmere goat populations
using more than 100 k snps extracted from more than  <dig> goats of major cashmere breeds in china, an obvious separation across these breeds was observed. phylogenetic analysis separated the tibetan cashmere goat populations  from other groups. this result is consistent with previous reports from our own studies and other studies based on microsatellite and mitochondrial data  <cit> . the other four chinese cashmere goat breeds were grouped into three sub-clusters, with ln and nj populations in one cluster and cdm and im populations in two distinct branches . these results are consistent with the breeding history of both cdm and nj cashmere goats because they both originated from a cross between the local goat breeds  and ln . the genetic exchanges between ln and nj, ln and cdm cashmere goat breeds for improving cashmere quality and quantity probably have led to a close relationship among these cashmere goat breeds.

we estimated the global fst value for each identified snp; the average fst value was  <dig> , indicating that a small portion of the genetic diversity in the total population was attributed to differences among the populations. in addition, all six breeds had a high proportion of polymorphic loci and a similar average heterozygosity value, suggesting that a high level of variation has been maintained within these chinese cashmere goat breeds. our overall global fst value was slightly lower than those of previous studies of chinese cashmere goats  and of other chinese indigenous goats . the relatively lower fst value in our analysis can be explained by the fact that we used exome snps, which have a lower rate of substitution than intergenic snps.

population differentiation pattern of cashmere goat populations
the topological structure of the phylogenetic tree based on the top  <dig>  % snps of the global fst analysis  slightly differed from that based on all snps , showing a relatively high level of genetic differentiation among all breeds . go enrichment analysis showed that genes with remarkable genetic differentiation among breeds were enriched in many different categories , thus indicating that the population differentiation pattern is complex and that the factor affecting the differentiation pattern is not unique. both natural and artificial selection have contributed to the genetic differentiation in these cashmere goat breeds.

since being subject to both artificial and natural selection for a long time, especially strong and directional selection recently, the evolutionary direction of the cashmere goat has been in line with human needs. china has a  <dig> -year history of cashmere production: an estimated  <dig>  tons of cashmere is produced per year  <cit> . indeed, a few genes associated with cashmere traits displayed significant differentiation among the different goat breeds. for example, the global fst analysis indicated that the desmoglein  <dig>  gene had the highest fst value  among the goat breeds; the gene plays an important role in maintaining the normal structure and function of hair  <cit> . go categories such as skin development  may be relative to the differential cashmere production in these breeds .

in addition, many genes with high fst values in the global fst analysis play a role in the cardiovascular system. the go categories previously reported to be associated with high-altitude adaptation in pig  <cit> , such as blood vessel development, vasculature development, and cardiac conduction, were significantly enriched  in our analysis. the go categories previously reported to be associated with high-altitude adaptation in grey wolf  <cit> , such as response to external stimulus, were also significantly enriched in our study . further analysis was performed to determine whether the above loci presenting significant genetic differentiation, such as cardiovascular system-related genes, are associated with high-altitude adaptation.

cardiovascular system-related genes play an important role in the high-altitude adaptation
adaptation to a hypoxic environment manifests as a large phenotypic shift observed in the tibetan cashmere goat compared with the goats living at low altitudes. previous studies have showen that the tibetan cashmere goat has a higher adult hb concentration, a heavier heart, lung and trachea, lower heart rate, and a high rate of arrhythmia . these adaptive phenotypic traits enable these animals to survive in the tibetan plateau. in the present study, we found molecular evidences in line with the phenotypic adaptations of the cardiovascular system.

first, genes related to cardiovascular system development were genetically differentiated in the global fst analysis . subsequently, we identified  <dig>  genes in the common snp dataset that were previously identified as cardiovascular system development-related genes . high-altitude stresses include hypoxia, decreasing temperature, low humidity, and increasing ultraviolet radiation  <cit> ; cold temperature and low oxygen are the two most remarkable factors that make survival at high-altitudes challenging  <cit> . moving materials  and regulating body temperature are the two most important functions of the cardiovascular system  <cit> . thus, environment stresses of different altitudes are key factors that simulate the differentiation of goat population, and cardiovascular system-related genes may play an important role in adaptation to high-altitude environments in goats.

high-altitude adaptation may be due to multiple genes that act in concert with one another. many cardiovascular system-related genes in the protein-protein interaction networks analysis are hub genes  that are thought to play crucial roles in networks  <cit> . for example, sirt <dig> encodes a member of the sirtuin protein family, which can deacetylate and activate hif2a in cultured cells subjected to hypoxia  <cit> . icam <dig> can be induced by hypoxia in aortic endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes . ednra and yes <dig> were shown to be involved in high-altitude adaptation  <cit> ; ednra encodes the receptor of endothelin- <dig>  a peptide that plays a key role in potent and long-lasting vasoconstriction  <cit> , whereas yes <dig> encodes a protein with tyrosine kinase activity that belongs to the src family  <cit> . yes is realted to hsp <dig>  which can be specifically upregulated through hif <dig> signaling under the hypoxic conditions  <cit> . jup encodes a major cytoplasmic protein that is the only known common component of the intracellular plaques of adhesions, predominantly desmosomes and adherens junctions  <cit> . mutations in this gene have been associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy  <cit> . however, none of these hub genes except for ednra contained non-synonymous snps.

validation of epas <dig> in a larger population
high-altitude human populations  on different continents show distinct patterns of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia  <cit> , and different species on the same continent also show different patterns of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia  <cit> . tibetan cashmere goats display several key adaptive features for coping with the harsh environment at a high altitude. one of these features is that tibetan cashmere goats display a higher than expected hb concentration relative to their lowland counterparts and to acclimatized lowland goats. in contrast to tibetan human and tibetan pig populations, which show decreased hb levels at high altitude, this feature is a crucial adaptation mechanism for goats that have adapted to a high-altitude environment  <cit> . the elevation of hb at high altitude has also been observed in tibetan yak and sheep  <cit> .

the epas <dig> gene is the most prominent candidate gene identified in this study. epas <dig>  a member of the transcription factor family characterized by a basic helix-loop-helix  and by a  pas domain, plays a prominent role in process of adaptation to hypoxia and in the promotion of survival during hypoxic stress. epas <dig> represents a “hot spot” of high-altitude adaptation research since several previously published studies provided evidence of an association between a few snps near or in epas <dig> and the high-altitude adaption  <cit> . the epas <dig> polymorphisms in the native tibetan people were found to be associated with their lower hb concentrations  <cit> . several non-synonymous mutations on epas <dig> have been identified in the tibetan dog, including a key amino acid mutation thought to be associated with the lower blood flow resistance  <cit> .

however, epas <dig> is pleiotropic; therefore, other responses to hypoxia may be similarly affected. a few individuals living at low altitudes have been reported to have gain of function mutations in the hif domains of epas1; these individuals exhibit excessive erythrocytosis and elevated hb levels  <cit> .

in our study, we also discovered a novel non-synonymous mutation, q579l, on epas <dig> in high-altitude goat populations; multi-species alignment indicated that this mutation is near to a well-defined domain  and is present at an evolutionary conserved site . mutations in this domain of human epas <dig> are associated with erythrocytosis and elevated hb levels  <cit> . goat epas <dig> q <dig> corresponds to human epas <dig> q <dig>  a study in humans demonstrated that a novel mutation in human epas <dig>  affects epas <dig> prolyl hydroxylation and vhl  protein binding, resulting in reduced epas <dig> ubiquitination but intact transcriptional activity and activation activity  <cit> . further screen of this allele in additional tibetan and lowland goat populations further confirmed a large divergence between low- and high-altitude goat populations . furthermore, a statistically significant association between the genotypes and mchc was found , implying the biological relevance of the mutant allele in the elevated mchc levels of the tibetan cashmere goat.

taken together, these results indicate that epas <dig> may play a key role in the adaptation of tibetan cashmere goats to a high-altitude environment at the molecular level; however, the adaptation patterns may not as the same in human and dog.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides insights concerning the high-altitude adaptation of the important goat breeds in china, which is crucial for the sustainable utilization of cashmere goat. a high level of variation has been maintained within the chinese cashmere goat breeds. genes involved in the cardiovascular system development and the missense mutation of epas <dig> may play a crucial role in the high-altitude adaptation of tibetan cashmere goats.
