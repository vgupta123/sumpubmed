BACKGROUND
plants use a series of physical, preformed chemical and inducible defense mechanisms to protect themselves from pathogen attack. one of the most common inducible defense mechanisms is systemic acquired resistance . sar can be triggered by infection with certain pathogenic strains. the induced resistance is typically effective against a wide range of pathogens including those taxonomically unrelated to the sar inducing organism  <cit> .

salicylic acid  is a signaling molecule of the sar pathway  <cit> . exogenous application of sa increases the resistance of tobacco plants to tobacco mosaic virus   <cit> . sar can be induced effectively by exogenous applications of either sa or synthetic functional analogs of sa,  <dig> -dichloroisonicotinic acid  and benzo  thiadiazole-7-carbo-thioic acid s-methyl ester   <cit> . in addition to signaling sar, sa regulates both basal and r-gene mediated local disease resistance mechanisms  <cit> .

the development of sar is associated with the induction of pathogenesis related  gene expression  <cit> . increases in the endogenous sa levels in the pathogen-inoculated plants coincide with the increased levels of the pr gene expression and enhanced disease resistance  <cit> . transgenic plants expressing the bacterial salicylate hydroxylase  gene cannot accumulate sa and fail to express sar development  <cit> . the pr genes, known as the sar markers, have been identified from several plant species including tobacco and arabidopsis  <cit> . a soybean pr <dig> homolog, gmpr <dig> is induced by both sa treatment and infection of soybean leaves with soybean mosaic virus   <cit> .

non-expressor of pr <dig>  is a regulatory gene of the sa signal pathway  <cit> . npr <dig> is also known as non-inducible immunity  <dig>   <cit>  or salicylic acid insensitive  <dig>  <cit> . the npr <dig> gene encodes a protein containing a bipartite nuclear localization sequence and two protein-protein interactive domains, a multiple ankyrin repeat domain and a btb/poz domain  <cit> . both motifs mediate the interactions of npr1/nim <dig> protein with other proteins. npr <dig> is an oligomeric, cytosolic protein. either following pathogenic infection or in response to sa treatment, npr <dig> oligomer becomes monomer and moves into the nucleus to activate transcription of pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit> . the npr <dig> protein is also homologous to the iÎº-b and the cactus regulatory proteins found in vertebrates and flies, respectively  <cit> . both genes are involved in pathways controlling innate immunity in animals. the npr <dig> mutants with mutations in npr <dig> are sensitive to sa toxicity. in the npr <dig> mutant plants, induction of pr genes and pathogen resistance by sa are abolished. in spite of their ability to accumulate sa, mutant plants are unable to induce sar indicating that npr <dig> is required for the sar signal transduction pathway  <cit> .

sar inducers have been used in various field studies on several crop plants to reduce disease incidence  <cit> . in all of these studies, sar inducers led to reduced disease symptom development. overexpression of arabidopsis npr <dig> or its orthologues in transgenic plants has been shown to induce broad-spectrum resistance. for example, overexpression of npr <dig> led to development of constitutive enhanced resistance against the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete pathogen hyaloperonospora parasitica in arabidopsis  <cit> . overexpression of npr <dig> and the rice homolog of npr <dig>  nh <dig> resulted in enhanced resistance against the blast pathogen, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in transgenic rice  <cit> . in tomato, overexpression of the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene resulted in an enhanced level of resistance to bacterial and fusarium wilts and a moderate level of resistance against gray leaf spot and bacterial spot diseases  <cit> . similarly, wheat plants transformed with arabidopsis npr <dig> resulted in enhanced resistance against fusarium graminearum that causes fusarium head blight in wheat and barley  <cit> . these studies suggest that manipulated expression of npr <dig> or its orthologues can create broad-spectrum resistance in crop plants, and therefore, could be a suitable strategy in improving crop plants for disease resistance  <cit> .

in the united states, soybean suffers annual yield losses valued at more than  <dig>  billion dollars from various pathogenic diseases  <cit> . sar in soybean was first reported following infection with colletotrichum trancatum that causes anthracnose disease  <cit> . a significant reduction in lesion sizes following c. trancatum infection was noted in epicotyls, when cotyledons were pre-injected with c. trancatum and c. lagenarium spore suspensions  <cit> . we investigated if sar in soybean is regulated by a pathway, similar to the one characterized in arabidopsis. we have shown that there are two orthologous npr <dig> copies in soybean. non conservation of the arabidopsis cys <dig> residue in gmnpr1s suggests that either conserved cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig> residues are sufficient for gmnpr1s' monomerization or some other soybean cysteine residue complements the arabidopsis cys <dig> function.

RESULTS
ina induces the pr- <dig> gene expression in soybean
earlier a soybean pr <dig> homolog, gmpr <dig> was shown to be induced by both sa treatment and infection of soybean leaves with smv  <cit> . it has not been shown if sa can systemically trigger the expression of gmpr <dig>  we determined if gmpr <dig> is systemically induced in leaves following feeding of soybean roots with ina, a functional analog of sa.

we used ina, a functional analog of sa, to induce gmpr <dig>  we investigated the time course accumulation of gmpr <dig> transcripts in response to ina treatment and the data are presented in figure  <dig>  northern blot analysis of 3-week old ina treated soybean seedlings showed that gmpr <dig> transcripts were detected as early as  <dig> h following ina treatment; and thereafter, gmpr <dig> expression levels continued to increase during rest of the time course. these results confirmed earlier observation of sa-mediated gmpr <dig> expression in soybean leaves  <cit> .

induction of pr- <dig> gene expression in systemic soybean leaves following phytophthora sojae infection
although it was demonstrated earlier that gmpr <dig>  a sar marker, was induced in response to smv infection, it has not been shown if gmpr <dig> is systemically induced in non-inoculated systemic leaves  <cit> . for sar, induction of gmpr <dig> gene, a sar marker, is needed in non-inoculated systemic tissue to provide resistance against secondary infection. to determine if pathogenic infection can also lead to gmpr <dig> expression in systemic tissues, hypocotyls of young soybean seedlings were inoculated with an avirulent p. sojae race and gmpr <dig> expression was monitored at the site of infection and in non-inoculated systemic leaves. induction of gmpr <dig> at infection sites was observed as early as on day  <dig> with a peak on day  <dig> post inoculation; and thereafter, induction continued until day  <dig> following inoculation . in the systemic leaves, induction of gmpr <dig> was clearly observed by day  <dig> following inoculation . no systemic induction of gmpr <dig> was observed when only agar medium with no p. sojae mycelia was used to inoculate the wounded hypocotyls . these results suggested that sar pathway is active in soybean.

induction of sar following phytophthora sojae infection
field studies suggested that sar was induced following infection of soybean with certain pathogens  <cit> . based on the results presented in figure  <dig>  we designed an experiment to investigate the extent of sar induction in soybean. wounded hypocotyls of 7-day old seedlings were inoculated with avirulent strain of p. sojae and subsequently at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after the inoculation leaves were infected with a virulent bacterial pathogen, p. syringae pv. glycinea . four days following psg inoculation colony forming units  of the pathogen in infected leaves were determined. bacterial counts were comparable to that in agar control when leaves were inoculated with the bacterium nine days following p. sojae-infection . bacterial counts were,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  times lower than the agar-controls when leaves were inoculated with psg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days following p. sojae-infection. however, only at  <dig> day the difference was statistically significant . these observations suggested that sar was induced in non p. sojae inoculated soybean leaves following hypersensitive response  <cit>  caused by an avirulent p. sojae race.

soybean genome contains two copies of npr1-like sequences
as a first step towards investigating the molecular components of the sar pathway in soybean, we determined if the soybean genome contains the orthologue of sar regulatory gene, arabidopsis npr <dig>  a  <dig>  kb fragment of a candidate soybean npr <dig> homolog was pcr-amplified from the soybean genomic dna and named gmnpr <dig>  dna gel blot analysis using the gmnpr <dig> probe revealed that there are two copies of npr1-like sequences in the soybean genome . screening of a soybean bacterial artificial chromosome  library  <cit>  for gmnpr1-like sequences resulted in identification of  <dig> bac clones. dna fingerprints of these clones for six restriction endonucleases allowed us to group these clones into two classes, class i and class ii. none of the bac clones contained both classes of npr1-like sequences suggesting that they are unlikely tandem genes. screening of a soybean cdna library prepared from etiolated hypocotyls with gmnpr <dig> resulted in identification of  <dig> putative clones. these clones were also grouped into two classes based on their restriction patterns. one near full-length cdna clone for each gmnpr1-like sequence was sequenced. we named these two npr1-like sequences, gmnpr1- <dig>  and gmnpr1- <dig> . gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> cdnas share 96% amino acid identity. both gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> shared 40% amino acid identity with arabidopsis npr <dig>  . the cdna sequences were identical with their corresponding genomic sequences obtained from plasmids p143k5xb1- <dig>    and p101f23e1- <dig>  . data obtained from dna blot analysis and characterization of bac and cdna clones strongly indicated that the diploidized tetraploid soybean contained two npr1-like sequences. in order to confirm this conclusion, we conducted nucleotide sequence comparison of the gmnpr <dig> genes with the soybean genome sequence . gmnpr <dig> genes were identified in two scaffolds  of the soybean genome sequence. gmnpr1- <dig> is located in scaffold_ <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> in scaffold_ <dig>  flanking regions of the two genes were compared for possible microcolinearity. high conservation of gene sequences between the two genomic regions suggested that the two gmnpr <dig> genes are homoeologous and were evolved during the polyploidization event .

we investigated if there were any additional gmnpr1-like sequences in the soybean genome. we conducted search for similar soybean est sequences using tblastx program (). this led to identification of a gmnpr1-1-like sequence  with 58% amino acid identity to gmnpr1- <dig>  duplicated copies of this sequence, gmnpr1-1-like- <dig> and gmnpr1-1-like- <dig>  were identified from scaffolds_ <dig> and _ <dig> of the soybean genome sequence . these two genes are located in homoeologous regions suggesting that they were also duplicated during polyploidization event . no significant nucleic acid identity of these two gmnpr1-1-like sequences to either of the gmnpr <dig> genes was observed. proteins encoded by these two homoeologous genes are truncated and do not contain more than  <dig> residues of the n-terminal core btb/poz domain required for sa-mediated activation of pr <dig> . thus, most unlikely they are involved in sar pathway.

gmnpr <dig> genes are constitutively expressed in soybean
to study the expression patterns of gmnpr <dig> genes, rt-pcr analyses were conducted using gene-specific primers on young and old leaves, stems, flowers, young pods, and roots. presence of an intron distinguished the pcr products of contaminating genomic dna from that of the reverse transcribed  cdna templates for gmnpr <dig> genes. gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> were constitutively expressed in all soybean organs investigated . rt-pcr analyses of both genes were conducted using the same rt-templates. therefore, patterns of steady state transcript levels of both genes in various organs were comparable .

gmnpr <dig> genes complemented the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant
gs_143k <dig> and gs_101f <dig> were selected from class i and class ii bac clones, respectively. to investigate if gmnpr <dig> genes were orthologous to arabidopsis npr <dig>  gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig>  isolated from these two bac clones, were transformed into the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant carrying the bgl2-gus fusion gene. transformants were analyzed to confirm the integration of gmnpr <dig> genes into npr1- <dig> by conducting dna blot analyses. the npr1- <dig> mutant does not induce pr- <dig> transcripts following the sa treatment because it lacks npr <dig> function. we investigated if gmnpr <dig> genes, under the control of their native promoters, complemented the npr1- <dig> mutant and mediated the expression of sar marker gene, pr- <dig> in response to ina treatment. transgenic arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant plants transformed with either gmnpr1- <dig> or gmnpr1- <dig> showed induction of the arabidopsis pr- <dig> gene following treatment with ina . no pr- <dig> transcripts were detected in water controls . these results suggested that gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> encode functional npr <dig> proteins that were presumably monomerized by ina treatment. the monomeric gmnpr1s then migrated into nuclei and activated transcription of the pr- <dig> gene. in absence of ina, none of the transgenic plants showed any detectible levels of pr- <dig> transcripts. these data suggested that cytosolic gmnpr <dig> migrated into nucleus following ina treatment  <cit> .

the sar marker bgl <dig> encoding Î²-glucanase also requires npr <dig> for its induction. the bgl2-gus fusion gene is silent in npr1- <dig> because of the absence of npr <dig> function  <cit> . to determine if gmnpr <dig> genes can complement this lost npr <dig> function and initiate pathogen-induced bgl <dig> expression, a transgenic npr1- <dig> mutant plant carrying either gmnpr1- <dig> or gmnpr1- <dig> was tested for expression of gus driven by the bgl <dig> promoter. transgenic npr1- <dig> plants carrying either gmnpr1- <dig> or gmnpr1- <dig> were able to show gus expression when infected with the avirulent pst strain containing avrrpt <dig>  these data suggested that both gmnpr <dig> proteins were able to complement the lost npr <dig> function in the npr1- <dig> mutant and induced pathogen-mediated bgl <dig> expression . no gus expression was observed in response to a virulent strain, pst dc <dig> carrying no avr genes . bgl <dig> expression was observed in the distant healthy tissues of the infected leaves . because of cell death, no gus expression was detected at the infection sites. results obtained from three independent experiments strongly suggested that npr <dig> function is complemented by both soybean gmnpr <dig> genes in the npr1- <dig> mutant.

to determine if gmnpr <dig> proteins can induce sar in non-inoculated leaves, we infected one transformant containing either gmnpr1- <dig> or gmnpr1- <dig> with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  dc <dig> containing avrrpt <dig>  three days after inoculation, we inoculated two young non-inoculated leaves with a virulent strain, pst dc <dig> and extent of sar induction in these leaves was determined. arabidopsis transformants carrying either of the gmnpr <dig> genes showed induction of sar in response to infection with the avirulent strain, pst dc <dig> carrying avrrpt <dig>  there was about  <dig> -fold reduction in the number of colony forming units  of pst in gmnpr1-1-complemented plants, when preinoculated with the avirulent strain as compared to the mgcl <dig> control . gmnpr1- <dig>  however, resulted in  <dig> -fold reduction in numbers of cfu in transformants, preinoculated with the avirulent strain as compared to that in the control . in the avirulent pst strain infected columbia, gmnpr1-1- and gmnpr1-2-complemented npr1- <dig> plants, significant reduction in cfu of pst was observed when compared to their corresponding mgcl <dig> controls .

discussion
sar pathway is conserved in soybean
soybean suffers estimated annual yield loss valued at  <dig>  billion dollars from attack of various pathogens  <cit> . broad-spectrum sar has the potentiality to reduce the crop losses from diverse pathogens in soybean. here we have presented molecular evidence suggesting that the sar pathway is conserved in soybean. we have isolated soybean genes encoding the sar regulatory protein, npr <dig>  results from southern blot analysis, gene cloning experiments and soybean genome analyses strongly suggested that there are two npr1-like sequences in soybean. we have also shown that in soybean, sar marker gmpr <dig> is induced in response to both  sar inducer, ina and  p. sojae infection .

in soybean, sar activity against psg was induced after two weeks of p. sojae infection . however, sar responses in soybean were not as effective as in some other plant species, such as arabidopsis thaliana, at least in response to the pathogenic infection tested in this investigation  <cit> . by three weeks following p. sojae infection, age-related resistance was expressed in both agar-controls and p. sojae-infected seedlings . age-related resistance has been reported to express in soybean against p. sojae  <cit> . accumulation of sa but not npr <dig> is required for this age-related resistance  <cit> .

soybean is a diploidized tetraploid species. most likely the two gmnpr <dig> genes were originated from duplication of a single progenitor gene during the polyploidization event. gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> with 96% amino acid identity are located in two highly colinear homoeologous chromosomal regions . rt-pcr data suggested that following duplication, promoter activities of the two genes have been conserved at least for the organs investigated in this study . both gmnpr <dig> proteins complemented the lost npr <dig> function of the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant and mediated the expression of pr- <dig> and bgl <dig> following ina treatment and infection, respectively . further, gmnpr1-complemented npr1- <dig> plants were able to show induction of sar following infection with an avirulent pathogenic strain . from these results we conclude that both gmnpr <dig> genes are orthologous to arabidopsis npr <dig> 

differences in structure-functional regulations of gmnpr <dig> and arabidopsis npr proteins
arabidopsis npr <dig> protein interacts with tga transcription factors in the nucleus to activate the expression of pr <dig>  <cit> . transportation of the npr <dig> protein into nucleus is stimulated by sar inducer  <cit> . the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant carrying either the gmnpr1- <dig> or gmnpr1- <dig> showed to initiate pr- <dig> gene expression following treatment with ina . no pr- <dig> induction was observed in the control ina treated mutant npr1- <dig> plant or in the water treated npr1- <dig> plants complemented with either gmnpr1- <dig> or gmnpr1- <dig> . in soybean, ina or infection induced accumulation of gmpr <dig> transcripts .

in healthy tissues, npr <dig> is an oligomeric, cytosolic protein. following sa treatment, arabidopsis npr <dig> dimers become monomers and move into nuclei to interact with tga transcription factors for transcriptional activation of pr <dig>  <cit> . in previous studies it has been shown that cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig> and cys <dig> are involved in oligomer-monomer transition  <cit> . first four of these  <dig> cysteine residues that are present in btb/poz domain of npr <dig> are conserved in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> . only cys <dig> was not conserved. we used the cys <dig> containing region of the gmnpr1- <dig> gene to isolate all available soybean expressed sequence tags and also soybean genome sequence by conducting tblastx searches. none of the soybean sequences showed to contain the arabidopsis cys <dig> residue. in this search, we however identified gmnpr1-1-like- <dig> and gmnpr1-1-like- <dig> genes that are located in two homoeologous chromosomal regions . proteins encoded by the two gmnpr1-1-like genes most unlikely activate the sar pathway because they are truncated at the n-terminus and do not contain the core btb/poz domain required for sa-mediated activation of pr <dig> .

in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> transformed npr1- <dig> plants  sar markers pr <dig> and bgl <dig> are induced following ina treatment and infection, respectively and  sar following infection . none of the complemented npr1- <dig> mutant plants showed any detectible levels of pr <dig> transcripts prior to ina treatment . these results suggested that gmnpr <dig> proteins become monomers only following infection or treatment with ina. thus, either cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig> and cys <dig> were sufficient for gmnpr <dig> oligomerization, or additional cysteine residue may co-operate with cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  and cys <dig> for oligomerization of gmnpr1s in soybean or in the gmnpr <dig> complemented npr1- <dig> plants.

in a recent study, s-nitrosylation of cys <dig> is shown to play important role in oligomerization of npr <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . in a mutation experiment, where cys <dig> was mutated to asp <dig>  the efficiency of oligomer formation was reduced as compared to the wild type protein  <cit> . in gmnpr <dig> proteins, although cys <dig> was mutated to alanine, both gmnpr <dig> proteins complemented npr <dig> function in the npr1- <dig> mutant . further investigation is warranted to determine the involvement of other cystein residues in s-nitrosylation in the absence of cys <dig> 

enhancing sar in soybean
we have shown that sar marker, gmpr <dig> is expressed in response to both ina treatment and p. sojae infection in soybean, and soybean npr <dig> orthologues are functional. in soybean, it has recently been demonstrated that rar <dig> and sgt <dig> are required for sar and are functional  <cit> . together, these data strongly suggest that sar is induced in soybean. therefore, overexpression of gmnpr <dig> genes will most likely enhance broad-spectrum resistance in soybean.

CONCLUSIONS
complementation analyses in the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant suggested that homoeologous gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> genes are orthologous to arabidopsis npr <dig>  therefore, sar pathway in soybean is most likely regulated by gmnpr <dig> genes. substitution of essential cys <dig> residue for oligomer-monomer transition of arabidopsis npr <dig> with ser and leu residues in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig>  respectively suggested that there may be differences between the regulatory mechanisms of gmnpr <dig> and arabidopsis npr proteins. soybean plants showed expression of the sar marker pr <dig> gene and sar following infection, and carry functional gmnpr <dig> genes suggesting that overexpression of gmnpr1s in transgenic soybean plants may enhance resistance against many pathogens.
