BACKGROUND
genome-wide association study  is a powerful tool for identifying genetic factors associated with phenotypes. population stratification refers to systematic differences in allele frequencies between subpopulations and is a source for false positive results in gwas
 <cit> . in human populations, geographical separation followed by genetic drift is the basic cause of population stratification. in dairy cattle, population stratification could be a result of several causes, genetic selection and hitchhiking, artificial selection, and genetic sampling or drift. in u.s. dairy cattle breeding, artificial insemination has been widely used and this has increased the likelihood of the presence of related individuals in randomly selected samples and the presence of large half-sib families; both of which contribute to population stratification. many years of genetic selection in dairy cattle has caused substantial allele frequency changes
 <cit>  that also contribute to population stratification. methods proposed to address population or sample stratification in gwas include the genomic control approach
 <cit> , principal component analysis 
 <cit> , and a mixed model approach
 <cit> . our dairy gwas report identified highly significant snp effects with minor favorable allele frequencies and a large number of x chromosome effects
 <cit> . this article is a follow-up study of our gwas report to analyze potential sample stratification of the study population, the relationship between the significant effects and sample stratification, and the effect of sample stratification correction on our reported gwas results. effect of stratification correction was evaluated with three methods: the efficient mixed-model association expedited  method which accounted for correlation among all individuals
 <cit> , a generalized least squares  method based on half-sib intraclass correlation
 <cit> , and a pca method
 <cit>  that used the top  <dig> principal components as covariables.

RESULTS
overlap between genome, pedigree and phenotype stratifications
the genome stratification based on  <dig>  snp markers was shown using the multidimensional scaling  method
 <cit>  for two sets of data: the association data set of  <dig>  contemporary holstein cows used in the gwas by cole et al.
 <cit> , and the selection signature data set
 <cit>  that included the  <dig>  contemporary cows and historical u.s. holstein cattle for a total of  <dig>  cows and bulls. the majority of the historical cattle  were the university of minnesota holstein control line that remained unselected since 1964
 <cit> .

the association data of  <dig>  cows showed some genome stratification, with a large cluster on the left and a small cluster on the right of figure 
1a. the x chromosome is the only individual chromosome with a similar stratification pattern  as the stratification for all chromosomes , and no individual autosome had such a similar pattern .
1: figure s <dig> 

the selection signature data set of  <dig>  contemporary and historical cattle showed more stratification with three clusters . the third cluster on the far left of figure 
1c had only eight cows, which were not separated as a cluster by figure 
1a. the x chromosome stratification pattern in figure 
1d did not resemble the stratification pattern of all chromosomes shown in figure 
1c but showed more stratification than any individual autosomes .

despite the fact that the cow dna samples in our gwas were from diverse academic and industry donors, analysis of usda’s historical holstein pedigree data revealed that the  <dig>  cows were all related when traced through approximately  <dig> to  <dig> generations  of ancestors . of the  <dig>  cows,  <dig>  cows were related to a bull born in  <dig>  and  <dig> cows were related to another bull also born in  <dig>  these two bulls had  <dig> common descendents among the  <dig>  cows, and only  <dig> of the  <dig>  cows were not descendents of these two bulls.

although all  <dig>  cows were related, the genome stratification patterns shown in figure 
 <dig> had a striking overlap with the half-sib pedigree structure from  <dig> sires . the number of cows per half-sib family  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the upper-right cluster of figure 
1c had  <dig> cows, of which  <dig> cows were half-sibs from one sire  that had  <dig> daughters among the  <dig>  cows. the other seven daughters in family  <dig> were classified into the left two clusters of figure 
1c . the genome from this sire, including autosomes and the x chromosome, is responsible for the stratification of the upper-right cluster of figure 
1c . the  <dig> half-sib cows should carry the same sire x chromosome , and this should be the reason for the strong x stratification pattern shown in figure 
1b. in contrast, the  <dig> half-sib cows should have different sire autosomes due to recombination between each pair of sire autosomes. collectively, the  <dig> autosomes had nearly identical stratification pattern as in figure 
1a .
3: figure s <dig> 

the genome and pedigree stratifications had various degrees of overlap with the phenotypic stratification for many of the  <dig> traits . fat, protein and milk yields had the strongest overlap between genome and phenotype stratifications. the genome stratification pattern using the data set of  <dig>  contemporary and historical cattle shown in figure 
1c had a stronger overlap with the phenotype stratification than the genome stratification pattern using the  <dig>  contemporary cows shown in figure 
1a. dimension i  of figure 
1c is strongly related to milk, fat and protein yields, with low-producing cows on the left and high-producing cows on the right. fitting c <dig> calculated from the  <dig>  historical and contemporary cattle in the statistical model virtually removed all significant effects for milk, fat and protein yields detected by the same method without c <dig> in the model, whereas the c <dig> values calculated from the  <dig>  contemporary cows essentially had no effect on snp effects .
4: figure s <dig> 

the  <dig> cows that comprised the small cluster in the upper right of figure 
1c  were primarily from one sire family  of elite cows. this cluster had a high frequency of cows with high pta values for fat, protein and milk yields, fat and protein percentages, productive life, daughter pregnancy rate, net merit, strength, stature, body depth, rump angle, fore udder attachment, udder depth, foot angle, rear legs , feet-legs score, final score, and had low pta values for somatic cell score, service-sire calving ease, daughter calving ease, service-sire stillbirth, dairy form, udder cleft, teat length, front teat placement, and rear legs  . this cluster had the most obvious overlap between the genome and phenotype stratifications for many of the  <dig> traits. the presence of the  <dig> elite cows in this small cluster and the presence of the  <dig> elite cows from one sire did not result in deviations from normal phenotypic distributions .

the x chromosome’s genetic stratification of the  <dig>  contemporary cows  had a similar overlap with phenotypic stratification as all chromosomes discussed above. in contrast, individual autosomes did not show such a strong overlap . the overlap between the x chromosome stratification and the phenotypic stratification could be a major reason why many x chromosome effects were detected in cole et al.
 <cit> . this overlap should be an opportunity for detecting potential x chromosome snp effects associated with the elite cows, although it is unclear whether this overlap contributed to detecting true or spurious x chromosome snp effects.

stratification analysis showed that the genome, pedigree and phenotype stratifications of the  <dig>  contemporary holstein cows used in the gwas
 <cit>  overlapped. the implication of this overlap is that the removal of population stratification effects could remove some true snp effects confounded with the population stratification that likely was a result of genetic selection, drift, and genetic hitchhiking of selection.

association results from three methods for stratification correction
the three methods for stratification correction included a mixed model method implemented by emmax
 <cit>  using ibs  or the balding-nichols  kinship matrix
 <cit>   among all  <dig>  cows, a gls method using intraclass correlation among half sibs
 <cit> , and a pca approach
 <cit>  using the top  <dig> principal components as covariables. the emmax method  was most severe in removing stratification effects or in reducing the number of significant effects, the pca method using  <dig> components and gls method had similar significance levels for most traits. for  <dig> dairy traits, emmax-ibs had  <dig>  and emmax-bn had six snp effects reaching genome-wide significance, in addition to a cluster of snp effects for fat percentage in and near the dgat1-nibp region of bta <dig> identified by all three methods. the  <dig> significant effects of emmax-ibs  included two effects for fat yield, two effects for protein percentage, three effects for service-sire calving ease, one effect for daughter calving ease, three effects for service-sire stillbirth, one effect for front teat placement, one effect for teat length, one effect for rear legs , and two effects for foot angle. gls and pca had more effects reaching genome-wide significance, generally dozens more per trait than emmax. a global view of all snp effects for each trait from the three methods is presented in manhattan plots
 <cit>  in additional file
6: figure s <dig>  the top  <dig> effects of each trait from emmax-ibs and emmax-bn are given in additional file
7: table s <dig>  the top  <dig> effects of each trait from gls are given in additional file
8: table s <dig>  and the top  <dig> effects of each trait from pca are given in additional file
9: table s <dig> 

effects from emmax, gls, and pca methods with genome-wide significance
the three methods had a small number of common effects reaching genome-wide significance. the common effects included a cluster of snp effects for fat percentage in and near the dgat1-nibp region of bta <dig>  a snp in dgat <dig> and a snp in a5d <dig> on bta <dig> for fat yield , and a snp 45kb upstream from pigy on bta <dig> with a 97% frequency of the favorable allele for protein percentage , and a snp in nibp on bta <dig> for protein percentage .

all three methods identified the dgat1-nibp region as the most significant region for fat percentage and eliminated most significant effects of other regions detected by the least squares  method without stratification correction , and identified a snp in dgat <dig> as the most significant and two nibp markers among the top  <dig> effects for fat percentage . emmax  identified the dgat1-nibp region as the only significant region for fat percentage, while gls and pca also had snp effects on other chromosomes that reached genome-wide significance but were far less significant than the dgat1-nibp region . all three methods for stratification correction identified dgat <dig> as the most significant for fat yield, and gls also identified the a5d786-cyhr1-vps28-dgat <dig> region as the most significant for milk yield.
 <cit> . ls_ <dig> is the ls analysis without the  <dig> elite cows.

the three methods for stratification correction had no overlapping effects with genome-wide significance for protein yield by any two of the three methods, but emmax and gls identified a  <dig>  mb region upstream of plcb <dig> as highly significant for protein yield , with the emmax effect below the genome-wide significance level. emmax-ibs had three effects for service-sire calving ease and emmax-bn had a snp in mbtps <dig> of btax for fat yield reaching genome-wide significance, but none of these was among the top  <dig> effects by the other methods. for body conformation traits, emmax-ibs had five snp effects with genome-wide significance for front teat placement , teat length , foot angle , and rear legs . emmax-bn generally had similar results as emmax-ibs with slightly lower significance .

common effects among top  <dig> effects/trait from methods with and without stratification correction
the two emmax models had only a small number of snp effects reaching genome-wide significance so that significant results of this method had minimal overlap with results from the other methods. since the exact threshold p-value that should be used for declaring significance for various methods under various conditions is unknown, the top  <dig> effects of each trait from the three methods with stratification correction  were compared with those from the ls method without stratification correction
 <cit>  . emmax-ibs had  <dig> snp effects, gls had  <dig> and pca had  <dig> effects overlapping with results from the ls method without stratification correction
 <cit>  . the four methods with and without stratification correction had limited common effects among the top  <dig> effects per trait, a total of  <dig> common effects for  <dig> of the  <dig> traits .

for milk yield, hapmap42685-bta- <dig> of bta <dig> about  <dig> kb downstream of anxa <dig> was ranked # <dig> by pca, # <dig> by emmax-bn, # <dig> by emmax-ibs, # <dig> by gls, and # <dig> by ls. the favorable allele frequency was  <dig>  in the elite cluster of  <dig> cows  and was  <dig>  in the remaining  <dig>  cows in the left two clusters of figure 
1c . for protein percentage, ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> in nibp was # <dig> by emmax-ibs and emmax-bn, # <dig> by gls, # <dig> by pca, and # <dig> by ls. the favorable allele frequency was  <dig>  in the elite cluster and  <dig>  in the average cluster. for daughter pregnancy rate, the four methods had two common snp effects on the x chromosome. hapmap55242-rs <dig> was # <dig> by emmax-ibs, # <dig> by emmax-bn and gls, # <dig> by ls and # <dig> by pca, and ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> in gria <dig> was # <dig> by emmax-ibs, # <dig> by emmax-bn, # <dig> by ls, # <dig> by gls, and # <dig> by pca. the favorable allele frequency of hapmap55242-rs <dig> was  <dig>  in the elite cluster and  <dig>  in the average cluster, and the favorable allele frequency of ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> was  <dig>  in the elite cluster and  <dig>  in the average cluster. for service-sire stillbirth, the four methods had two common snp effects on the x chromosome: hapmap28373-bta- <dig> was # <dig> by emmax-ibs and pca, # <dig> by ls, and # <dig> by gls, and ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> was # <dig> by emmax-ibs, # <dig> by pca, # <dig> by ls and # <dig> by gls. the favorable allele frequency was  <dig>  in the elite cluster and  <dig>  in the average cluster for both markers. for body conformation traits, eight traits had overlapping effects among the four methods with and without stratification correction . allele frequency differences between the elite and average clusters generally were not as large as those discussed above .

comparison with effect size distribution from usda genomic prediction
the usda genomic prediction uses genomic correlations among all individuals
 <cit>  and routinely publishes the snp effect size distributions at the website of animal improvement programs laboratory 
 <cit> . effect size distributions from the april  <dig> holstein genomic evaluation based on  <dig>  bulls and  <dig>  cows were compared with the effect significance in this study for consensus snp effects of the  <dig> dairy traits. a relatively small number of large effects  involving an even smaller number of genes were observed from the usda genomic evaluation. the three gene regions that accounted for most of the large aipl effects included dgat <dig> of bta <dig>  siglec <dig> of bta <dig> and the mir584-8~kal <dig> pseudo-autosomal region of btax. of these three gene regions, dgat <dig> and siglec <dig> were reported in an aipl study
 <cit> . the five methods for snp testing  had confirmation with the aipl effects for  <dig> of the  <dig> traits , and the ls method had two bta <dig> markers that were the most significant for three traits  with the largest aipl effects at siglec <dig>  all five methods confirmed the large effects for fat percentage in the first  <dig>  mb region of bta <dig>  emmax, gls and pca confirmed the largest effect for fat yield in the dgat <dig> region and the largest effect for protein percentage at a snp 45kb upstream from pigy on bta <dig>  other confirmations included those by gls and emmax for milk yield at dgat1; ls and gls for somatic cell score in the gc-npffr <dig> region of bta <dig>  emmax and pca for productive life, service-sire calving ease, body depth and front teat placement at siglec12; ls for stature, fore udder attachment, rear udder height and final score in the mir584-8~kal <dig> region of btax; emmax for rump width at siglec <dig> and dairy form in the mir584-8~kal <dig> region of btax, and pca for service-sire stillbirth at siglec <dig>  gls had the best confirmation of the aipl effects for milk yield  and had the strongest milk effects with seven markers among the top  <dig> effects for milk yield in the a5d786-gml region of bta <dig> that had  <dig> genes including dgat <dig>  gls had significant snp effects for protein yield upstream of dgat <dig> in vps <dig>  and cyhr <dig>  but did not confirm dgat <dig> which had the largest aipl effect for protein yield and was located next to vps <dig>  ls confirmed a large aipl effect at  <dig>  mb of bta <dig> for fat percentage. ls had highly significant effects at  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb for productive life, net merit, service-sire calving ease and daughter calving ease, and at  <dig>  mb for daughter pregnancy rate. for these traits, the aipl effects and the emmax and pca effects for service-sire calving ease and the pca effect for service-sire stillbirth were at siglec <dig> .

my, milk yield; fy, fat yield; py, protein yield; fpc, fat percentage; ppc, protein percentage; pl, productive life; scs, somatic cell score; dpr, daughter pregnancy rate; sce, service-sire calving ease; ssb, service-sire stillbirth; dce, daughter calving ease; nm, net merit; sta, stature; bd, body depth; df, dairy form; rw, rump width; fua, fore udder attachment; ruh, rear udder height; ftp, front teat placement; fs, final score.

 <dig> the number on the left is the aipl effect rank and the number on the right is the significance rank of this method for the same marker effect.

 <dig> underlined ranking is not an exact match to an aipl effect and the exact location is the underlined location in the same row under ‘gene region’.

the snp effects confirmed by aipl’s large effect sizes and statistical significance in this study could be considered as consensus snp effects in u.s. holstein cattle given the large sample size in the usda holstein genomic evaluation.

consensus effects in elite cows
genetic variants relevant to the unique genetics of the elite cows should have high frequencies in the elite cows and low frequencies in the average cows. similarly, snp markers with similar frequencies between the elite and average clusters should be less likely to be the genetic factors separating the elite cows from the average cows. allele frequency differences  between the elite and average cows showed that the consensus effects unlikely were the most important genetic effects for the unique genetics of the elite cows.

the widely confirmed dgat <dig> gene had the most significant snp  for fat percentage. the ‘a’ allele of this snp was favorable for milk yield but was unfavorable for fat yield and fat percentage, and the ‘g’ allele was the opposite, favorable for fat percentage and fat yield and unfavorable for milk yield. this snp had afd of  <dig>  between the elite and average clusters, noting that more than half of the  <dig>  snp loci had afd greater than  <dig>  between the two clusters. moreover, the favorable allele frequency in the elite cluster for fat yield was  <dig>  less than in the average cluster,  <dig>  in the elite cluster and  <dig>  in the average cluster. therefore, it is questionable whether dgat <dig> had a major role in the elite cows for fat yield given that 87% of the dgat <dig> alleles in the elite cluster had unfavorable effects for fat yield. the 87% frequency of the favorable dgat <dig> allele for milk yield  was consistent with the high milk production levels of the elite cows but again was unlikely to have a major role in the milk production levels of the elite cows because the frequency of the favorable allele for milk yield was only 5% higher in the elite than in the average. in contrast, the nibp region with highly significant ls effects for fat percentage, fat yield, protein yield and protein percentage had the largest afd  between the elite and the average cows in the dgat1-nibp region .

the siglec <dig> gene had large aipl effects for six functional traits, productive life, daughter pregnancy rate, service-sire calving ease, service-sire stillbirth, daughter calving ease, and net merit. the effect of service-sire calving ease was confirmed by emmax and pca, and the effect of service-sire stillbirth was confirmed by pca . however, the favorable allele of siglec <dig> had similar frequencies in the elite cows  and the average cows . the snp immediately upstream of the siglec <dig> effect had large afd  but was insignificant by any of the five methods of snp testing. the aipl effect size distributions ranked this marker # <dig> for daughter calving ease, # <dig> for service-sire calving ease, and # <dig> for body depth. for five of the six functional traits  with large aipl effects at the siglec <dig> marker, the most significant markers by ls had large afd between the elite and the average at  <dig>  mb  and loc <dig>  .

for protein percentage, the favorable allele of hapmap24324-btc-062449), # <dig> by all methods for stratification correction and by the aipl effect size distribution, had nearly identical frequency in both elite and average, about  <dig>  in each cluster . for somatic cell score, the favorable allele of the snp marker  between gc and npffr <dig>  had an afd  <dig>  . the favorable allele of the snp  immediately upstream of btb- <dig> had an afd of  <dig>   and was ranked # <dig> by ls and # <dig> by gls, but this marker was not among the top  <dig> effects for aipl, emmax  and pca  .

the results of afd for the favorable alleles of the consensus effect showed that the consensus effects for production, fertility and calving traits had similar frequencies for the favorable alleles in the elite and the average cows. these results indicate that the consensus effects shown in figure 
 <dig> may not explain the unique genetics of the elite cows and that the unique genetics of the elite cows likely involved additional genes not represented by genes with consensus effects.

elite cows and favorable alleles with minor frequencies
dairy gwas results in cole et al.
 <cit>  had highly significant effects with low frequencies for the favorable alleles in the study population of  <dig>  cows and had a large number of significant effects from the x chromosome. the analysis of genome, pedigree and phenotype stratifications identified the most likely reason for the rare favorable alleles: the rare favorable alleles had high frequencies in the elite cluster of  <dig> cows and low frequencies in the remaining  <dig>  cows in the average cluster. since each sire contributes 50% of the alleles to its daughters, sire alleles that had low population allele frequencies could have allele frequencies around 50% among the  <dig> daughters in the elite cluster, creating substantial comparison of allelic effects between the elite and the rest. this type of allelic comparison could identify true effects because elite cows are a small percentage of the population and should have high frequencies of favorable alleles that were rare in general populations. although alleles satisfying this condition could have false positive effects due to chance, alleles that do not satisfy this condition should be less likely to be relevant to the elite status. the snp markers with favorable alleles overwhelmingly possessed by the elite cluster should have provided a pool of snp markers that are potentially responsible for the unique genetics of the elite cows.

many of the highly significant snp markers with rare favorable alleles had high frequencies in the elite cluster and low frequencies in the average cluster. a total of  <dig> snp markers had afd of  <dig>  or greater and  <dig>  snp markers had afd of  <dig>  or greater between the elite and average clusters. most of these markers had some effects on the  <dig> dairy traits by the ls method
 <cit> , particularly those with larger afd. this fact indicates that the presence of the elite cluster contributed to the detection of significant snp effects, although it is unknown which effects are true or false positive effects.

a notable snp is bta18’s bfgl-ngs- <dig> with a minor allele frequency of  <dig>   in the  <dig>  cows. among the  <dig> elite cows, the same g allele had a frequency of  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  in the average cluster of  <dig>  cows . the g allele was the favorable allele for fat, protein and milk yields, fat and protein percentages, productive life, and net merit ; and was the favorable allele for somatic cell score, service-sire calving ease, daughter calving ease and service-sire stillbirth . this snp had the eighth largest afd  between the elite and average clusters. other highly significant snp with large afd included the most significant snp for daughter pregnancy rate and somatic cell score  near insr on bta <dig> with afd of  <dig> , the second most significant snp on bta <dig>  for somatic cell score with afd of  <dig> , the most significant snp for milk yield on bta <dig>  with afd of  <dig> , the snp with the largest number of highly significant effects for body conformation traits in ren on bta <dig>  with afd of  <dig> , the most significant snp on bta <dig> near mgmt for foot angle  with afd of  <dig> , and many snp loci for dairy form, rear legs , foot angle, strength, udder depth, and teat length . the unequal allele frequencies between the elite and average clusters indicate that the above snp markers could be relevant to the elite cows. nearly all snp markers highly significant for fat yield without stratification correction
 <cit>  had large afd between the elite and average clusters. for example, the nibp marker that was ranked # <dig> by the ls method had afd of  <dig> , with favorable allele frequency of  <dig>  in the elite cluster and  <dig>  in the average cluster . this marker was also highly significant for protein percentage .

elite large half-sib family and x chromosome effects
some of the highly significant x chromosome snp markers reported in cole et al.
 <cit>  had large afd between the elite and average clusters. however, not all x chromosome markers with large afd were highly significant. the  <dig> half sibs of the  <dig> elite cows should have identical sire x chromosomes except the pseudo-autosomal region. therefore, x chromosome allele frequencies in the elite cluster could be substantially higher than in the average cluster. among the  <dig> snp markers with afd of  <dig>  or greater,  <dig> markers were the x chromosome markers . in cole et al.
 <cit> , ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> was in a gene desert on chromosome x but was highly significant for protein percentage , fat percentage , service-sire calving ease , fat yield , protein yield  and productive life . this marker had afd of  <dig>  , with favorable allele frequency of  <dig>  in the elite cluster and  <dig>  in the average cluster. the marker with the largest afd  was also on the x chromosome , with favorable allele frequency of  <dig>  in the elite and  <dig>  in the average, but this marker was not among the top  <dig> effects for any of the  <dig> traits, indicating that large afd alone was not guaranteed to be highly significant. the x chromosome snp  with the fourth largest afd also was not among the top  <dig> effects for any trait. the snp   <dig>  kb upstream of loc <dig> had afd of  <dig> , and was # <dig> for productive life and # <dig> for somatic cell score. the x chromosome snp that was highly significant for several body conformation traits, hapmap46795-bta- <dig> in phka <dig>  had afd of  <dig> .

ls analysis without the elite cows
to test the hypothesis that the significant snp results from the ls analysis was influenced by the elite cows and that stratification correction may have removed some true snp effects we performed a separate ls analysis for  <dig>  of the  <dig>  cows by removing the  <dig> elite cows from the data set. without the elite cows, many of the highly significant ls results for dairy functional traits disappeared, including bta18′s bfgl-ngs- <dig> for a large number of traits, and x chromosome markers ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> and ars-bfgl-ngs- <dig> . for the widely confirmed fat percentage effects on bta <dig>  the ls analysis without the elite cows nearly achieved the effect of stratification correction and eliminated most significant ls results with the elite cows except the dgat1-nibp region of bta <dig>  the highly significant bta <dig>  bta <dig> and btax snp effects with the elite cows were eliminated and the highly significant bta <dig> and bta <dig> effects became much less visible when the elite cows were removed . similarly, many highly significant ls results for fat yield, protein yield, protein percentage, service-sire sire calving ease, daughter calving ease and foot angle were eliminated once the elite cows were removed. this analysis showed that many of the significant ls results for fat percentage and the other traits were due to the elite cows and that stratification correction removed effects associated with the elite cows. without the ls analysis, genetic information unique to the elite cows would have been left undetected.

the gls and emmax methods for stratification correction were little affected by the removal of the elite cows, further indicating that the snp effects removed by stratification corrections were largely associated with the elite cows. a few exceptions were increased significance for some traits with the removal of the  <dig> elite cows. increased significance of emmax-ibs included the bta <dig> effects for milk yield, somatic cell score and feet and legs, and bta <dig> effects for fore udder attachment and rear teat placement, and increased gls significance included some bta <dig> effects for udder cleft .

combined analysis of correlation based methods and pca
the methods of correlation based, emmax and gls, were combined with pca by adding the top  <dig> pc’s to the statistical model for emmax-ibs and gls. emmax-pca generally had slight decreases in significance, and gls-pca analysis substantially reduced the gls significance for most traits. two exceptions to the reduced significance resulting from adding pca included the increased significance of the bta <dig> snp effect for pl by emmax-pca and for gls-pca, and the increased significance for the bta <dig> effect on rw by gls-pca that were consistent with the aipl results. however, adding pca diminished several significant effects from gls that were consistent with the aipl results, including the bta <dig> effects for protein yield and the bta <dig> effect for somatic cell score .

discussion
stratification correction may remove true effects associated with selection
genetic selection and artificial insemination are major factors contributing to population stratification in dairy cattle. genetic selection since  <dig> has resulted in phenotypic changes for many traits. most of the  <dig> traits in this study had phenotypic changes in one direction since  <dig> . associated with phenotypic changes and breeding practice are gene frequency changes due to genetic selection. the widespread use of artificial insemination in dairy breeding accelerates the replication of selected male genomes. genome sampling  in breeding practice inevitably would contribute to genome stratification and spurious effects because only a fraction of the population is maintained for producing the next generation. genetic hitchhiking of selection, which refers to allele frequency changes due to linkage disequilibrium with loci subjected to selection
 <cit> , also contributes to genome stratification and spurious association effects.

the three methods used in this study for stratification correction eliminated most effects associated with the elite cluster, indicating that the removal of stratification effects likely have removed some true effects associated with genetic selection.

the mechanism of removing true effects associated with selection is different for different methods. for methods using correlation among individuals such as emmax and gls, the mechanism of removing true effects associated with selection is the correction of an individual’s phenotypic value by phenotypic values of all related individuals so that the corrected individual phenotypic values may become less different from each other. for the pca approach, the mechanism of removing true effects associated with selection is the correlation between principal components and phenotypic values. the stratification analysis in this study showed that genome and phenotype stratifications overlapped . consequently, the removal of genome stratification by pca likely also removes true genetic effects associated with the phenotypic stratification. it should be noted that the pca approach has a problem of subjectivity in choosing the number of principal components because the use of different numbers of principal components may result in different results. for the dairy gwas data in this study, the use of the first component  and the use of the first  <dig> components  had drastically different results. current methods for stratification correction in association analysis do not separate drift and hitchhiking from selection. selection signature analysis may provide evidence for genes and chromosome regions affected by selection

cleaner signals from stratification correction for large effects without genetic selection
the methods for stratification correction in association analysis could yield cleaner signals of snp effects and could be used for detecting potential large effects for traits without genetic selection. two of the  <dig> traits in our study clearly were not subjected to genetic selection since 1964: fat and protein percentages. these two traits were unchanged since  <dig>  with slight increase before  <dig> and slight decrease after  <dig> for fat percentage, and slight decrease before  <dig> and slight increase after  <dig> for protein percentage . the fat percentage effects of bta <dig> is an excellent example showing how stratification correction could reduce potential noise and produce much cleaner signals of significant effects . the two models of emmax, emmax-ibs and emmax-bn, had the cleanest signals, virtually eliminating all effects except those in and near the dgat1-nibp region of bta <dig>  however, it is unknown whether such clean signals came at the expense of the elimination of some less significant true effects. another unknown is whether the fat percentage effects could have been detected with similar statistical confidence had fat percentage been subjected to many years of directional selection. comparing protein percentage that also was not subjected to selection with fat percentage, it should be apparent that protein percentage did not have similar major effects to those for fat percentage in our study population of  <dig>  contemporary holstein cows. this assumption was supported by the effect sizes from the usda holstein genomic evaluation. the effect size range of the top  <dig> effects for fat percentage was  <dig>  times as large as the effect size range of the top  <dig> effects for protein percentage .

CONCLUSIONS
genetic selection and artificial insemination were major factors associated with holstein genome stratification that overlapped with pedigree and phenotype stratifications. the confounding between genome and phenotype stratifications may provide opportunity to discover genetic effects and cause difficulty in separating true and spurious effects. stratification correction in genome-wide association analysis in holstein cattle could remove true effects associated with stratification due to genetic selection.
