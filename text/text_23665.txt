BACKGROUND
mucolipidosis type iv  is a genetic neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease affecting a variety of functions in patients  <cit> . a very thin corpus callosum found in mri scans of the brain of patients indicates a deficit in embryonic brain development  <cit> . a neurodegenerative process that causes optical nerve atrophy and loss of vision occurs in all patients in childhood  <cit> . patients suffer severe psychomotor retardation and most do not learn how to walk and speak. mliv patients also have achlorhydria, or the inability to secrete gastric acid by parietal cells  <cit> .

cells in mliv patients exhibit a number of defects. many tissues, including the cornea, stomach parietal cells, and pancreas have large vacuoles containing fibrinogranular inclusions, multilamellar membranes and vesicles  <cit> . mliv cells show a delay in the degradation and/or transport of endocytosed lipids that accumulate in these large vacuoles  <cit> . mliv fibroblasts also show a defect in the fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane in response to treatment with the ca2+ ionophore ionomycin  <cit> .

the gene mutated in mliv is mcoln <dig>  which encodes mucolipin- <dig>   <cit> . ml <dig> is predicted to have six transmembrane domains and is a group  <dig> transient receptor potential -related cation channel  <cit> . ml <dig> is a non-selective, ph-regulated cation channel with a preference for monovalent cations  <cit> . one possible cell biological function for ml <dig> in skin fibroblasts is as a proton leak channel that regulates the rate at which endosomes/lysosomes acidify  <cit> . ml <dig> localizes to late endocytic compartments and its overexpression results in abnormalities in these structures  <cit> .

ml <dig> is first transported to the plasma membrane and is subsequently endocytosed and targeted to lysosomes  <cit> . however, the transport of ml <dig> is also dependent on the ap- <dig> adaptor complex, but not the ap- <dig> or the ap- <dig> adaptor complexes, suggesting a second direct transport route from the trans-golgi network to lysosomes  <cit> . ml <dig> can be cleaved within the first intracellular loop and the two resulting portions remain associated. it is not clear whether this cleavage occurs in endosomes/lysosomes or at the trans-golgi network, and whether it is required for the inactivation of the protein or is part of its normal processing  <cit> .

there are two other mucolipins in mammals. mucolipin- <dig>  mucolipin- <dig>  and mucolipin- <dig> interact to form homo- and hetero-multimers  <cit> . all three proteins localize to late endosomes/lysosomes, though the localization of mucolipin- <dig> requires an interaction with either of the other two homologues  <cit> . it is therefore not known whether some of the symptoms in mliv patients are due to the mislocalization of mucolipin- <dig> due to the absence of ml <dig>  while there are no known existing mutations in mucolipin- <dig>  varitint-waddler  mice have mutations in mouse mucolipin- <dig> resulting in deafness and pigmentation defects  <cit> . there is likely some redundancy in function between the mucolipins since dt <dig> b-lymphocytes lacking ml <dig> do not show a pronounced lysosomal defect, while in contrast, overexpression of dominant negative forms of ml <dig> or of mucolipin- <dig> results in the large vacuole defect characteristic of mliv cells  <cit> .

cup- <dig> is the sole caenorhabditis elegans mucolipin and is required for the biogenesis of lysosomes from late endosome  <cit> . analogous to the cellular abnormalities in mliv, mutations in cup- <dig> result in the accumulation of large vacuoles in some cells and in embryonic lethality, mostly due to developmental/tissue degeneration defects  <cit> . mucolipin function is conserved since expression of human ml <dig> or mucolipin- <dig> rescues both of these defects. mucolipin- <dig> has not yet been tested.

in this study, we sought to define more accurately the sites at which ml <dig> functions and to identify primary defects in cells with reduced ml <dig> levels. we used raw <dig>  cells because, like coelomocytes of c. elegans, macrophages have elaborate lysosomal transport pathways that allow us to visualize intermediate steps in lysosomal transport. here, we show that ml <dig> is required for dynamic late endosomal/lysosomal trafficking events in macrophages.

RESULTS
co-localization of ml <dig> with markers for various endocytic compartments
we made a stable raw <dig>  clone in which gfp-ml <dig> is expressed under the control of the cmv promoter. in these stable clones, approximately 70% of the cells express gfp-ml <dig>  a similar gfp fusion to cup- <dig> is fully functional and rescues all defects of cup- <dig> worms, while a similar fusion to human ml <dig> rescues the mliv defects in fibroblasts  <cit> .

to determine the subcellular localization of gfp-ml <dig>  we immuno-stained these cells using antibodies against the early endosomal protein hrs, m6pr that cycles between late endosomes and the golgi apparatus, the late endosomal/lysosomal lipid lbpa, and the lysosomal marker lamp <dig>   <cit> . consistent with previous studies that localized ml <dig> to late endocytic compartments in other cell types, we saw more extensive co-localization of gfp-ml <dig> with late endocytic markers   <cit> . the high incidence of co-localization of gfp-ml <dig> with lbpa is a novel result and indicates that ml <dig> localizes primarily to compartments that contain internal vesicles and lamellae  <cit> .

we also made a functional fusion of the red fluorescent protein mcherry to the amino-terminus of ml <dig>  to ascertain that this fusion protein shows the same localization pattern as gfp-ml <dig>  we co-transfected cells with the mcherry-ml <dig> and the gfp-ml <dig> or yfp-lamp <dig> expressing plasmids. consistent with the lamp <dig> immunofluorescence staining, mcherry-ml <dig> co-localized strongly with yfp-lamp <dig> and with gfp-ml <dig> . we then co-transfected cells with mcherry-ml <dig> and gfp-rab <dig>  expressing plasmids  <cit> . we saw significant co-localization of mcherry-ml <dig> with gfp-rab <dig> 

co-localization of gfp-ml <dig> with endocytosed substrates
to further define the localization and behavior of ml <dig> in lysosomal compartments, we examined the localization of gfp-ml <dig> relative to endocytosed soluble solutes. we pulsed stable gfp-ml <dig> clones with bsa-alexafluor  <dig> for  <dig> minute and then fixed the cells after various chase times . there are four main conclusions from this analysis. first, we saw progressively increased co-localization between bsa-alexafluor  <dig> and gfp-ml <dig> that peaked at around  <dig> minutes and remained the same for  <dig> hours . second, there were always some compartments that contained bsa-alexafluor  <dig> but that were not labeled with gfp-ml <dig>  even at the 24-hour time point when all of the bsa-alexafluor  <dig> is in terminal compartments. third, we saw many tubules emanating from gfp-ml1-labeled compartments . fourth, we saw bsa-alexafluor  <dig> concentrations in substructures that were 300â€“ <dig> nm in diameter and that were attached by tubules to endocytic compartments. gfp-ml <dig> localizes to these endocytic compartments, including the tubules and attached substructures . the number of these gfp-ml1-labeled compartments that showed a polarized distribution of bsa-alexafluor  <dig> increased over the time course of the experiment, peaked to about  <dig> +/-  <dig> per cell at the 15-minute time point, and remained the same at later time points. these structures were not a consequence of the overexpression of gfp-ml <dig> since they were apparent in untransfected raw <dig>  cells .

we also examined the progress of the fluid-phase marker dextran-rhodamine through gfp-ml1-labeled compartments  <cit> . we essentially saw the same behavior using dextran-rhodamine, including the extent of co-localization at various time points and the appearance of substructures with polarized distributions of dextran-rhodamine .

reduction of ml <dig> levels results in a delay in the transport of lipids to the golgi apparatus
we made two independently isolated raw <dig>  stable clones, called ls <dig> and ls <dig>  expressing an shrna from the constitutive histone h <dig> promoter and targeting mcoln <dig>  the levels of mcoln <dig> mrnas are significantly reduced,  <dig>  +/-  <dig> % and  <dig>  +/-  <dig> % of raw <dig>  levels in ls <dig> and ls <dig>  respectively . the levels of mcoln <dig> mrnas are unchanged,  <dig>  +/-  <dig> % and  <dig>  +/-  <dig> % of raw <dig>  levels in ls <dig> and ls <dig>  respectively . we could not detect mcoln <dig> rna in repeated northern blot experiments .

reducing ml <dig> levels in raw <dig>  cells does not result in the hyperacidification of late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. this was determined either by staining of cells with the ph-sensitive dye acridine orange or after loading the terminal compartments with the ph-sensitive endocytic substrate dextran-oregon green  <dig> . previous studies have produced conflicting data on the hyperacidification of lysosomes in mliv fibroblasts  <cit> . the lack of hyperacidification of terminal compartments in our raw <dig>  rnai lines may be due to residual ml <dig> activity, to redundancy with mucolipin- <dig>  and/or the presumed ph regulatory function of ml <dig> may be tissue-specific.

mliv fibroblasts also show a delay in the transport of the fluorescent lipid analogue bodipy-laccer from endocytic compartments to the golgi apparatus  <cit> . to determine whether raw <dig>  cells had a similar defect, we pre-labeled the terminal compartments of raw <dig> , ls <dig>  and ls <dig> cells with dextran-cascade blue, pulsed cells with bodipy-laccer for  <dig> minutes, and chased for  <dig> minutes or  <dig> minutes. by  <dig> minutes, all of the bodipy-laccer reached the peri-nuclear golgi apparatus of raw <dig>  and did not co-localize with the dextran-cascade blue . in contrast, while some of the bodipy-laccer reaches the peri-nuclear golgi apparatus in ls <dig> and ls <dig> cells, there is still significant co-localization of the bodipy-laccer with dextran-cascade blue-labeled compartments indicating a delay in the exit of bodipy-laccer from these compartments .

reduction of ml <dig> levels results in a delay in the transport of endocytosed proteins to lysosomes
previous results had shown that cup- <dig> in c. elegans is required for the transport of endocytosed bsa from late endosomes to lysosomes  <cit> . to determine whether ml <dig> is also required for lysosomal transport, we loaded the terminal compartments of raw <dig> , ls <dig> or ls <dig> cells with bsa-alexafluor  <dig> by incubating cells with the fluorescent marker the first day for  <dig> hours followed by a 24-hour incubation in the absence of the marker. approximately 5% of ls <dig> and ls <dig> cells showed a significantly enlarged terminal compartment that contained the fluorescent endocytosed marker . in the absence of ml1-specific antibodies, we cannot determine whether these represent cells with the most reduction in ml <dig> levels or whether loss of ml <dig> in all cells would give a similarly low penetrant phenotype. the complete loss of ml <dig> in dt <dig> b lymphocytes has been reported not to affect the sizes of the terminal compartments  <cit> .

to determine whether there is a delay in the trafficking of endocytosed proteins to terminal compartments of ls <dig> and ls <dig> cells, we pulse-chased bsa-alexafluor  <dig> into cells whose terminal compartments were pre-loaded with bsa-alexafluor  <dig> . after a 10-minute pulse, most of the bsa-alexafluor  <dig> has reached the bsa-alexafluor 594-stained terminal compartments in raw <dig>  cells. this co-localization in wild type cells remains the same after  <dig> or  <dig> minutes chase times . in contrast, in ls <dig> and ls <dig> cells, there is no co-localization of the bsa-alexafluor- <dig> and the bsa-alexafluor 594-stained compartments, either normal-sized ones or enlarged ones, after the 10-minute pulse , by  <dig> minutes of chase, some of the bsa-alexafluor  <dig> has reached the terminal compartments, and this co-localization is complete by  <dig> minutes .

having observed a delay in lysosomal transport, we asked whether there was a delay in the degradation of endocytosed proteins. we therefore pulsed cells with hen egg lysozyme  for  <dig> minutes and determined the remaining hel in cells at various chase times. ls <dig> and ls <dig> cells showed increased cellular levels of endocytosed hel at the different chase times relative to raw <dig>  cells . the bsa transport and hel degradation results indicate that ml <dig> is required for the efficient transport of endocytosed proteins to lysosomes.

nature of the enlarged compartments in mcoln <dig> rnai raw <dig>  cells
to determine the nature of the enlarged vacuoles in the mcoln1- rnai clones, we pre-loaded their terminal compartments with bsa-alexafluor  <dig> and stained these cells for various markers . none of the enlarged vacuoles stained for m6pr or for hrs, indicating that they do not have typical early or late endosomal characteristics. these enlarged vacuoles stain for lamp <dig> and for rab <dig>  which is consistent with their lysosomal nature. furthermore, they strongly stain for lbpa, which is consistent with cells isolated from mliv patients showing enlarged compartments that contain both multivesicular and multilamellar membranes  <cit> .

reduction of ml <dig> levels results in a delay in the transport of mhcii to the plasma membrane
gfp-ml <dig> localizes to late endocytic lbpa-positive compartments and is likely required for the efficient exit of lipids and of endocytosed proteins from these compartments. the major histocompatibility complex ii  localizes to lbpa-positive late endosomal/lysosomal compartments of antigen presenting cells and is transported to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of these cells  <cit> . to determine whether ml <dig> is required for this transport step, we first determined whether mhcii co-localizes with gfp-ml <dig> in normally growing cells or after addition of lps at  <dig> Î¼g/ml for one day to the cells. this lps treatment has been previously shown to induce the differentiation of raw <dig>  macrophages into dendritic-like cells while upregulating plasma membrane levels of mhcii and of other dendritic cell surface markers  <cit> .

in the absence of lps, we saw some mhcii expression in gfp-ml1-positive vesicles in raw <dig>  macrophages . the addition of lps to these cells resulted in the described increase in cell size and morphology and a dramatic enhancement of mhcii expression. in these lps treated cells, mhcii co-localized with gfp-ml <dig> on tubulovesicular compartments . because of the substantial amount of mhcii that remained in the cytoplasm of cells, we could not unambiguously visualize mhcii that had been transported to the plasma membrane.

to determine whether ml <dig> is required for the transport of mhcii to the plasma membrane of raw <dig>  cells, we treated raw <dig> , ls <dig>  and ls <dig> cells with lps for one days and stained cells to detect mhcii at the plasma membrane. in the absence of lps, none of the three lines showed any surface staining. in the presence of lps, raw <dig> , ls <dig>  and ls <dig> showed plasma membrane staining, indicating that mhcii is transported to the plasma membrane in all three lines . however, the levels of mhcii at the plasma membrane of ls <dig> and ls <dig> cells were approximately four-fold lower than those of raw <dig>  cells . we saw the same result using two different anti-mhcii antibodies and in the presence or in the absence of ifn-Î³ that elevates total mhcii levels . raw <dig> , ls <dig> and ls <dig> cells express similar levels of intracellular mhcii as assayed by immunofluorescence staining following permeabilization . in all three lines, mhcii localizes to lbpa-positive intracellular compartments . these results indicate that in the absence of ml <dig>  there is a reduction in the efficiency of the transport of mhcii to the plasma membrane.

discussion
macrophages, like c. elegans coelomocytes, are highly endocytic cells. because of the dynamic nature of lysosomal pathways in these cells, it is technically easier to characterize intermediates steps in lysosomal transport. in this study, we show that ml <dig> localizes primarily to lbpa-positive lysosomal compartments and is required for the efficient transport of at least two kinds of molecules from these compartments.

ml <dig> localization in raw <dig>  macrophages
ml <dig> localizes primarily to lbpa-positive, lamp1-positive, and rab7-positive compartments. the limited co-localization of overexpressed gfp-ml <dig> with early  and with late  endosomal markers is consistent with ml <dig> being transported to the surface and subsequently being endocytosed and transported through various endosomes before accumulating in these lbpa-positive compartments  <cit> . it is not known whether ml <dig> has separate functions in earlier steps, for example, in hrs-positive or in m6pr-positive endosomes. we think that this is unlikely because if there is a delay in trafficking from one compartment to another, then we would expect that the resulting enlarged structure would be a hybrid of these two compartments. reducing ml <dig> levels results in expanded compartments that do not stain for either hrs or m6pr but that do stain for lbpa, lamp <dig>  and rab <dig> 

transport of endocytosed solutes in raw <dig>  macrophages
during their transport to lysosomes, endocytosed bsa and dextran are found in intermediate structures where bsa and dextran concentrate in substructures that are attached by tubules to parent compartments. gfp-ml <dig> localizes to all of these structures. this is strikingly similar to what has been previously observed in coelomocytes  <cit> . the substructures have a diameter of  <dig> to  <dig> nm, and given the time course of the experiments, likely are subcompartments that contain concentrations of lumenal proteins that are destined for lysosomes. the scission of these "buds" would segregate lysosomally-destined proteins from the rest of the lbpa-positive compartments. this is, or is analogous to, the reformation of lysosomes from hybrid organelles that has been observed both in vitro and in live cells  <cit> .

while it is not yet known how bsa, dextran, and very likely other molecules are concentrated in substructures, these substructures, are topologically similar to endocytic invaginations at the plasma membrane. a possible mechanism for the concentration of endocytosed solutes in these substructures is the use of scavenger receptors that would bind lumenal molecules and cytoplasmic adaptors to concentrate these receptors in the substructures. ml <dig> is unlikely to have such a function since the absence of cup- <dig> in worm coelomocytes does not block the concentration of bsa in substructures though it does block the scission of these from the parent compartments  <cit> .

if gfp-ml <dig> is found primarily in a pre-terminal compartment, then why do we always detect a high co-incidence of localization of endocytosed molecules with gfp-ml <dig>  even at late chase times. we think this is because terminal lysosomal compartments continuously fuse with, and deliver their content to, late endosomal compartments forming what has been termed hybrid organelles  <cit> . as mentioned above, a budding and fission reaction is used for the reformation of lysosomes  <cit> .

even at  <dig> hours of chase time after the uptake of fluorescent bsa, there are always some terminal compartments that contain endocytic tracers and that do not stain for gfp-ml <dig>  we think these represent dense core lysosomes in which gfp-ml <dig> has been inactivated, possibly by cathepsin b-mediated cleavage as has previously been described  <cit> . these dense core lysosomes continuously fuse with earlier gfp-ml1-positive compartments.

ml <dig> requirement in lysosomal transport pathways
we show that reducing ml <dig> levels results in the delay in the transport of bodipy-laccer to the golgi apparatus, of endocytosed proteins to the terminal compartments, and of mhcii to the plasma membrane. as has been previously shown, the bodipy-laccer co-localizes with endocytosed dextran during its transit to the golgi apparatus, and given the high incidence of localization of dextran with gfp-ml <dig>  very likely with gfp-ml <dig>  similarly, mhcii and gfp-ml <dig> co-localize extensively.

in our model we suggest that ml <dig> localizes primarily to a pre-lysosomal m6pr-negative, lbpa-positive compartment that serves as a hub for the transport of molecules to various destinations . soluble molecules like bsa and dextran are concentrated in substructures that emanate and separate from these compartments. following the fission reaction, these substructures fuse with lysosomes, during which time ml <dig> is inactivated, possibly due to a reduction in ph and the activation of proteases. previous results have implicated cathepsin b in the proteolytic cleavage and the inhibition of ml <dig> channel activity in lysosomal compartments  <cit> . this is an iterative process in which ml1-negative lysosomes continuously fuse with gfp-ml1-labeled compartments, thus delivering partially digested peptide fragments for loading on mhcii. the transport of mhcii to the plasma membrane also involves tubulovesicular intermediates, and thus may also require ml <dig> for their formation or for the scission of tubules before they fuse with the plasma membrane  <cit> .

reducing ml <dig> levels results in a delay and not a block in these lysosomal transport events. in the case of bsa transport, the assays we used would only detect a delay in transport and not a complete bloc if for example ml <dig> is required for the formation or scission of substructures but is not required for the fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes. in addition, mucolipin- <dig> likely has redundant functions with ml <dig> since while a genomic knockout of mcoln <dig> in dt <dig> b-lymphocytes does not result in expanded terminal compartments, the overexpression of dominant-negative carboxyl-terminal gfp fusions of ml <dig> or of mucolipin- <dig> both show this phenotype.

finally, we do not know whether ml <dig> directly functions in bodipy-laccer trafficking, in bsa transport, and/or in mhcii transport. one possibility is that ml <dig> performs a similar function in all of these transport steps, for example, in the formation and/or scission of tubulovesicular extensions. alternatively, ml <dig> may be required in one transport step such that the loss/reduction of ml <dig> levels retards this step leading to the accumulation of substrates in the hub compartment, and this accumulation indirectly interferes with other transport pathways. future studies will identify specific requirements of ml <dig> in these transport pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
mucolipin- <dig> localizes to dynamic compartments in murine macrophages. mucolipin- <dig> is required for the efficient exit of lipids destined for the golgi apparatus, of endocytosed molecules destined for terminal lysosomes, and of mhcii destined for the plasma membrane, from these compartments.
