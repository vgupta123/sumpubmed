BACKGROUND
bacterial genomes are mosaic structures composed of genes present in every strain of the same species , and genes present in some but not all isolates of a species   <cit> . genomic and population studies have shown that core and accessory genes often display distinct evolutionary histories, mainly due to the differential degree of mobility and selective pressures to which each category is subjected. it is accepted that the evolutionary histories of accessory genes are more complex than those of housekeeping genes  <cit> . therefore, it is desirable to study core and accessory genes to better understand the population structure of a bacterial species  <cit> .

salmonella enterica is considered by population geneticists as the paradigm of a clonal bacterial species, that displays low levels of recombination and has mainly evolved by point mutations  <cit> . salmonella enterica is subdivided in seven subspecies, the strains responsible for almost all the salmonella infections in humans and warm-blooded animals belong to subspecies enterica. salmonella enterica subspecies enterica has more than  <dig>  described serovars  <cit> . to discriminate clones within serovars, macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field electrophoresis  and phage-typing are frequently used as subtyping techniques. more recently, multilocus sequence typing  has become an important tool for the study of salmonella strains  <cit> .

salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium  is considered a broad host range serovar, usually associated with gastroenteritis in a broad range of phylogenetically unrelated host species  <cit> . the aim of this study was to compare the genetic diversity of core and accessory genes of a set of typhimurium isolates sampled from food-animal and human sources in four geographic regions of mexico. mlst and macrorestriction pfge fingerprints were used to address the core genetic variation. to evaluate the distribution and genetic variation of the accessory genome, genes involved in pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance were selected. schematic representations of the molecular markers assessed in this study are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  and a brief description of them is presented below.

mlst is based on allelic differences in the nucleotide sequences of housekeeping genes among bacterial strains of a given species   <cit> . macrorestriction analysis uses endonucleases that cut dna at rare restriction sites, generating large fragments that are resolved by pfge . this methodology exhibits mostly chromosomal variation, but large plasmids can also be observed within the fingerprint  <cit> .

for the accessory genome, we determined the presence of the typhimurium virulence plasmid . this plasmid has been extensively studied in regard to its role in invasiveness in the murine model  <cit> ; its importance in human systemic infections is still controversial  <cit> . three genetic markers were used to determine the presence of pstv: spvc, rck and trat, that are genes involved in resistance to serum and survival in macrophages   <cit> .

the antibiotic resistance determinants studied were those contained in integrons, and the presence of the plasmid-borne cmy- <dig> gene , conferring resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins. the cmy- <dig> gene is of major public health relevance since it confers resistance to ceftriaxone, the drug of choice for treatment of children with invasive salmonella infections. in a previous study, we reported the rapid dissemination of this resistance in typhimurium from yucatán, mexico, and its association with systemic infections in children  <cit> . most cmy- <dig> genes have been located in large plasmids , and were not found as an integron-born cassette  <cit> .

the integron is a recombination and expression system that captures genes as part of a genetic element called a gene cassette . class  <dig> integrons are found extensively in clinical isolates, and most of the known antibiotic resistance gene cassettes belong to this class  <cit> . they are frequently located on plasmids and transposons, which further enhances the spread of the gene cassettes  <cit> .

class  <dig> integrons have been detected in different salmonella serovars in many countries  <cit> . among the most studied cases are the chromosomally located integrons present in the so-called salmonella genomic island  <dig>  . sgi <dig> is a  <dig> kb integrative-mobilizable chromosomal element on which antibiotic resistance genes are clustered, flanked by two class  <dig> integrons  <cit> . the first cassette carries the aada <dig> gene, which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, and the second cassette contains pse- <dig>  which confers resistance to ampicillin. in between them are flor, tetr and tetg genes, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol-florfenicol and tetracycline. a cryptic retronphage element is found as the last element of sgi <dig> in typhimurium strains  <cit> .

in the present work, analysis of the whole set of genetic markers targeting both housekeeping and accessory genes allowed us to determine genetic subgroups within the mexican typhimurium population.

RESULTS
distribution, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial resistance of mlst genotypes
the multilocus genotype for  <dig> typhimurium isolates sampled from food-animal and human sources in four regions of mexico, was determined. the seven-locus scheme recommended in the salmonella mlst database  <cit>  was applied to  <dig> isolates, in order to compare the diversity of our isolates with those reported in the database. the partial sequences of seven housekeeping genes revealed a low level of genetic variation; among the  <dig>  nt only four substitutions were detected, yielding four multilocus genotypes or sequence types  . thus, three novel alleles were identified: pure <dig>  which consisted of a synonymous substitution, pure <dig>  which contained one synonymous and one non-synonymous substitution, as compared with the pure <dig> allele present in most of the typhimurium strains reported; and suca <dig> which consisted of a synonymous substitution, as compared with the predominant suca <dig> allele. st <dig> is the predominant typhimurium genotype in the mlst database  and has a worldwide distribution . sts  <dig> and  <dig> have been reported only in mexico, while st <dig> has been reported in mexico and zimbabwe  <cit> . despite the limitations of an analysis based on only four substitutions, an eburst analysis of clonal relatedness among the different sts was consistent with the notion of st <dig> as the founder genotype of the clonal complex, with the other three sts linked to st <dig> as single-locus variants . for the remaining  <dig> isolates we applied a three-gene scheme  that allowed us to discriminate among sts . the most abundant genotypes, st <dig> and st <dig>  were found in the four geographic regions and in almost all the sampled years . these genotypes presented a differential distribution among the sources of isolation . interestingly, st <dig> was more prevalent in food-animals than in humans, where st <dig> was predominant .

a allele and st numbers were those assigned in the salmonella mlst database  <cit> .

b number of strains analyzed using the seven-locus or the three-locus scheme .

c yu, yucatán; mi, michoacán; sl, san luis potosí; so, sonora.

d novel alleles and sequence types  obtained in this work study.

we found a temporal pattern in which the derived st <dig> is replacing the founder st <dig> in the four geographic regions . st <dig> was predominant in yucatán and san luis potosí in the first period . during the second period , st <dig> was the most abundant genotype in yucatán, michoacán and san luis potosí; only in sonora st <dig> was the most abundant genotype. however, by the end of the time period studied , st <dig> was the predominant genotype in all four states .

we found a strong association between sts and antimicrobial resistance. st <dig> isolates presented higher percentages of resistance  than st <dig> isolates, the only exception was ciprofloxacin for which all the isolates were susceptible . all the isolates resistant to ceftriaxone belonged to st <dig>  while all the isolates from sts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were ceftriaxone susceptible. the group of isolates resistant to ceftriaxone  was associated with very high percentages  of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfisoxazole, streptomycin and tetracycline, here after referred to as the pentaresistant phenotype.

a amp:ampicillin, chl: chloramphenicol, sss: sulfisoxazole, str: streptomycin, tet: tetracycline, gm: gentamicin, km: kanamycin, nal: nalidixic acid, sxt: timethoprim-sulfametoxazole, cip: ciprofloxacin, cro: ceftriaxone.

b all the strain were sensitive to cip according with clsi  <cit> , including twelve strains with low-level resistance .

c the number in parenthesis is the percentage corresponding to st <dig> strains positive for cmy- <dig> 

the resistance patterns varied across geographic locations. yucatán was the state with the higher level of multidrug resistance, with an average of seven resistances per isolate; while sonora presented the lowest levels of resistance with an average of four. michoacán and san luis presented intermediate values, both with an average of six. furthermore, the st <dig> ceftriaxone resistant isolates displayed a differential geographic pattern, ranging from 97% of the st <dig> isolates in yucatán to 0% in sonora, with intermediate levels in michoacán and san luis potosí .

distribution and associations of pcmy-2
isolates resistant to ceftriaxone were subjected to pcr analysis to detect the presence of the blacmy- <dig> gene . all  <dig> isolates resistant to ceftriaxone were positive, whereas the  <dig> sensitive isolates tested were negative . sequencing  of cmy- <dig> for  <dig> isolates revealed that all carried an identical allele, suggesting a common origin. the blast searches showed that this allele was identical to most of the  <dig> hits targeting the enterobacteriaceae .

to determine the location of the cmy- <dig> gene, plasmid profiles for  <dig> isolates were hybridized with the corresponding radioactive probe. in all the isolates positive for cmy- <dig> the probe hybridized with a plasmid of about  <dig> kb, hereafter referred to as pcmy-2; while the negative isolates did not yield a signal. the strength of the association between pcmy- <dig> and chromosomal genotype was confirmed , since all the isolates harbouring pcmy- <dig> were st <dig> .

distribution, genetic diversity and associations of pstv
the presence of pstv was first assessed by pcr amplification of spvc. only 30% of the isolates were positive for spvc . to confirm the presence or absence of the pstv we amplified rck and trat for all  <dig> spvc positive isolates, and for  <dig> spvc negative isolates. all spvc positive isolates amplified trat and rck, with the exception of two isolates that did not amplify rck ; while the spvc negative isolates did not produce amplifications with either rck or trat.

to evaluate the genetic diversity of pstv we determined the nucleotide sequences of spvc for  <dig> representative isolates . all spvc sequences  were identical to each other, displaying only one nucleotide substitution with respect to the sequence of strain lt <dig>   <cit> . we further determined the sequences of trat and rck for  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, respectively. the trat  and rck  sequences were also identical to each other and to the sequence of strain lt <dig>  these results show pstv with a low level of genetic diversity distributed in the four geographic regions and recovered during the five sampled years.

we confirmed the presence of pstv and determined its approximate size by southern blot hybridization of plasmid profiles for  <dig> isolates. all the isolates that where positive for the amplification of spvc, rck and trat hybridized with a plasmid of the same size of that of the pstv of strain lt <dig>   <cit> , and all the negative controls produced no signal with the spvc probe. however, one of the isolates that did not amplify rck hybridized with a larger plasmid of about  <dig> kb, indicating that this pstv is different, probably due to the insertion of mobile elements, such as transposons, as previously reported  <cit> .

pstv was present in  <dig> st <dig> isolates , the four st <dig> isolates  and only one st <dig> isolate . this finding indicates that pstv was not randomly distributed among isolates, since 60% of the isolates were st <dig>  and showed a significant association between st <dig>  and pstv . human isolates harboured pstv significantly more than food-animal isolates , demonstrating a significant association with the human host. many of these isolates were isolated from humans with diarrhea or asymptomatic infection; only one of the six isolates from systemic infections had pstv , indicating that its presence does not necessarily cause extra-intestinal infections.

detection and associations of integrons
all  <dig> isolates were assessed for the presence of integrons using primers targeting the cs regions , which amplify the cassettes inserted in integrons. a high proportion  of the isolates produced an amplification product . the most abundant one  was of about  <dig>  bp, and was designated as integron profile  <dig> . the nucleotide sequence of this integron for  <dig> isolates showed that it was composed of an array of three cassettes containing the genes dfra <dig>  orff and aada <dig> . the sequences  were almost identical to each other  and to most of the sequences retrieved after blast searches from genbank . an integron of about  <dig>  bp was present in six isolates and designated as integron profile  <dig>  . nucleotide sequencing showed that it was composed of two cassettes containing the genes dfra <dig> and aada <dig>  the sequences  of the six isolates were identical to each other and to most of the genbank sequences . two isolates produced amplification bands of about  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp; sequence determination showed that they harboured oxa- <dig> and orfd, and aada <dig> cassettes, and were designated as ip- <dig> and ip- <dig>  respectively . blast searches showed that the sequence of ip- <dig>  was identical to an integron of aeromonas hydrophila from taiwan , and the sequence of ip- <dig>  was identical to an integron of yersinia enterocolitica from spain  .

the second most abundant integron profile  was conformed by two amplification bands of about  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp. this is typically the profile recovered from the sgi <dig>  and therefore was designated as ip-sgi <dig> . sequence determination for three isolates showed that the  <dig>  bp cassette contained aada <dig> and that the  <dig>  bp cassette coded for pse- <dig>  which are the most commonly found integrons in the sgi <dig>  all the isolates were positive for the amplification of pse-1and aada <dig> using primers specific for these genes . to confirm the insertion of the complete sgi <dig> in the chromosome, we performed pcr assays to amplify the left and right junctions. all the isolates  harbouring the ip-sgi amplified the left junction, the right junction, and were positive for the amplification of the cryptic retronphage on the right junction . isolates harbouring other integrons did not amplify any of the junctions of the sgi <dig>  to further characterize the sgi <dig>  we amplified the tetg and flor genes that are in between the two integrons. only the isolates harbouring the ip-sgi <dig> produced strong amplification products with tetg, and all were positive for flor; however, other chloramfenicol resistant isolates also amplified flor. all the cmy- <dig> positive isolates  were positive for flor, which is in agreement with the report by doublet et al.  that both resistances are often found in the same plasmid  <cit> . thus, most of the flor positive isolates harboured sgi <dig> or pcmy- <dig>  however, other chloramfenicol resistant isolates were positive for flor. some of the isolates harbouring ip- <dig> showed weak amplification bands with tetg or flor primers, probably due to the presence of related but divergent genes conferring resistance to tetracycline and chloramfenicol . two significant associations among integrons and the other molecular markers are worthy of mention. first, all ip- <dig> were carried by st <dig> isolates , either cmy- <dig> positive or negative. second, all the isolates with sgi <dig> were st <dig> and carried pstv , the only exception was one isolate that did not carry pstv .

to determine the location of the integrons, we performed southern hybridization experiments using fragments of the inti <dig> and aada <dig> genes as probes on the plasmid profiles of eight representative isolates. three of the five isolates harboring ip- <dig> hybridized with a plasmid of about  <dig> kb, the remaining two ip- <dig> isolates hybridized with a plasmid of about  <dig> kb. the isolate harboring ip- <dig> hybridized with a plasmid of about  <dig> kb, ip- <dig> with a plasmid of about  <dig> kb, and ip- <dig> with a plasmid of about  <dig> kb.

detection of inti <dig> and qaceΔ1
to further characterize the 5' and 3' css of integrons we amplified inti <dig> and qaceΔ <dig> . all isolates displaying ip- <dig>  ip-sgi <dig>  ip- <dig> and ip- <dig> showed strong amplification bands for inti <dig> and qaceΔ <dig>  which indicates that they have 5' and 3' css typical of class <dig> integrons. all the isolates with ip- <dig> amplified a strong band with inti <dig>  but only four isolates amplified strong bands for qaceΔ <dig>  most of the isolates with ip- <dig>  did not amplify qaceΔ <dig> or produced very weak bands  . this result suggests that most of these integrons contain an unusual 3' cs, as recently reported for this integron in salmonella and staphylococcus  <cit> . twenty isolates that did not amplify the cassette region using the cs-f and cs-r primers were selected to test the amplification of inti <dig> and qaceΔ <dig>  most of these isolates did not produce amplifications, or produced very weak bands; only four isolates presented an intense inti <dig> band.

macro-restriction pfge dendrogram and association among molecular markers
the pfge fingerprints were clustered using the upgma algorithm. the dendrogram was divided in five clusters using a cut-off value of 78% similarity . cluster i grouped all the st <dig> isolates and four st <dig> isolates. using the information provided by the accessory genes, this cluster can be further subdivided in four main groups. group ia contained only st <dig> isolates from three different states, many of which carried cmy- <dig> and ip- <dig>  groups ib and ic contained st <dig> isolates mostly without cmy- <dig> and st <dig> isolates without pstv, and comprising five of the six ip- <dig>  group id was similar to group ia; it contained st <dig> isolates, most of which harboured cmy- <dig> and ip- <dig>  it is distinguished from groups ia and ib by the lack of a large restriction fragment of about  <dig> kb. cluster ii was formed by st <dig> isolates carrying both pstv and sgi <dig>  clusters iii and iv grouped st <dig> isolates and the four st <dig> strains, most of them carrying pstv. cluster iv contained the two st <dig> isolates for which rck could not be amplified, and one of them carried the ip- <dig> integron. finally, cluster v was composed by st <dig> strains lacking pstv. a few exceptions to these general patterns were detected, such as a cluster i st <dig> isolate harbouring pstv  or a st <dig> isolate harbouring pstv and sgi <dig> in cluster i . the whole set of genetic markers targeting both housekeeping and accessory genes allowed us to discover genetic subgroups within the isolate set.

discussion
low genetic diversity of core and accessory genes
both housekeeping and accessory genes displayed extremely low levels of genetic diversity; even the third codon positions were invariable. the low genetic diversity and the clonal pattern of descent of accessory elements could be explained by several evolutionary processes, such as rapid clonal expansion of the population, genetic drift, the existence of barriers to genetic exchange among subgroups within the population, or a combination of these possibilities  <cit> . most of the genetic diversity was provided by the presence/absence of accessory genes, including plasmids , integrons , and a chromosomally inserted island , rather than by nucleotide polymorphisms. this result is in agreement with the conclusions derived from salmonella whole genome comparisons and microarray data  <cit> .

geographic distribution of multilocus genotypes and antimicrobial resistance
both mlst and pfge analysis revealed the presence of widely distributed typhimurium clones that were isolated from human and food-animal sources, during different years and from diverse geographic locations in mexico. taken together, our results indicate that: 1) there are effective mechanisms for the dissemination of salmonella throughout the country and, thus, the entire sample can be considered a single population; 2) the isolates found in food-animals and humans are related; and 3) the clones causing disease in humans do not differ from those circulating in healthy humans or animals. the observation that isolates from human and food-animal sources come from the same genetic pool is in agreement with our previous reports  <cit> , and with studies from other parts of the world  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis of salmonella transmission through the food chain. the fact that the isolates causing disease  in humans are not distinct clones from those carried by healthy humans and animals, suggest differences in the bacterial inoculum, immune status of the host and modes of transmission. furthermore, there may be differences in virulence determinants affecting the pathogenic capabilities, that cannot be distinguished by the methodologies applied in this study.

we found that the derived st <dig> is replacing the founder st <dig>  genotype replacement has been previously reported for salmonella, as well as other bacterial species and virus. for example, the replacement of typhimurium dt <dig> by the globally disseminated dt <dig> has been reviewed elsewhere  <cit> . the comparison of historic  and contemporary  serovar newport isolates showed that they belonged to clearly separated pfge clusters  <cit> . shifts in the clonal prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus have been documented in hospitals from spain and portugal  <cit> . these results show that shorts periods of time are enough to observe drastic changes in genotype circulation, as reported in the present study. the geographic differences in the number of resistance determinants in st <dig>  in particular, the extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in isolates from yucatán  as compared with isolates from sonora , could be reflecting regional differences in the use of antibiotics in animal production. in this study we found strong associations among antimicrobial determinants. for example, all the cmy- <dig> positive isolates carried ip- <dig>  were positive for flor and presented the pentaresistant phenotype. this finding is in line with several studies that report the spread of large transferable plasmids carrying multiple resistance determinants  <cit> . the pentaresistant phenotype was also displayed by isolates harbouring the chromosomally inserted sgi <dig>  which demonstrates that the same resistance phenotype can have a completely different genetic background, as reported by others  <cit> .

because of the recent dissemination of cmy- <dig> positive typhimurium isolates in mexico  <cit> , the genotypic characterization of our isolates is of public health relevance and provides useful information that can be used to improve the integrated food chain surveillance system that is being established in this developing country  <cit> .

distribution of pstv among hosts and chromosomal genotypes
whether the pstv is necessary to produce systemic infections in humans has been subject of intense debate. some authors claim that there is lack of evidence of an association between the carriage of pstv and human bacteremia  <cit> . other authors suggest that spv genes promote the dissemination of typhimurium from the intestine  <cit> . in a recent report, heithoff et al.  found that all the typhimurium strains isolated from humans with bacteremia or animals possessed pstv, while 34% of the strains isolated from human gastroenteritis lacked pstv  <cit> . these results are in contrast with the data obtained in the present study. unexpectedly, we found that less than half of all human strains harboured pstv, and only one of the six isolates recovered from patients with systemic infection had pstv, supporting the view that pstv is not essential for human systemic infections. on the other hand, pstv was significantly associated with human isolates , indicating that the st19-pstv genotypes are adapted to the human host, while st <dig> genotypes are adapted to both animal and human hosts. in conclusion, our data supports the notion that pstv has a role in host adaptation  <cit> , however, are not consistent with the view that pstv is associated with systemic infection in humans.

there are some reports describing the differential distribution of pstv within typhimurium genotypes. olsen et al.  performed plasmid transfer experiments with the aim of demonstrating that different typhimurium genotypes differed in their ability to obtain and express pstv  <cit> . ou and baron  observed that the introduction of a plasmid from a highly virulent strain did not increase virulence in all strains, particularly in those that were moderately virulent with their own plasmids, or did not contain a pstv  <cit> . these reports highlight the importance of the genomic background in the interaction with the pstv. in the present study we found a statistical association between genomic background and the presence of pstv. this finding is also consistent with the pfge dendrogram, in which subgroups are strongly associated with the presence or absence of pstv.

we found that almost all the isolates harbouring the pstv were st <dig> , while all the isolates harbouring pcmy- <dig> were st <dig>  since st <dig> is a recently derived genotype from st <dig>  and st <dig> isolates did not harbour pstv, it is appealing to speculate that st <dig> arose as a derived clone lacking pstv , and that this condition allowed the acquisition of pcmy- <dig> .

distribution of pcmy- <dig> among chromosomal genotypes
since the presence of pcmy- <dig> in salmonella is very recent compared to other enterobacteriaceae, its differential distribution within genotypes of a single salmonella serovar is scarcely documented. the association of the ampc phenotype with a subgroup of genotypes has been documented mainly for newport. gupta et al.  found that the isolates with this phenotype presented highly related pfge restriction patterns that differed from those of the susceptible isolates  <cit> . harbottle et al.  found that all the newport isolates with the multidrug resistant ampc phenotype were grouped in a single pfge cluster, and belonged to only two of the  <dig> sts present in the sample  <cit> . zhao et al.  found that the cephalosporin resistant newport isolates presented related pfge fingerprints and differed from those of susceptible isolates. similar findings were reported for serovar dublin  <cit> . on the other hand, alcaine et al.  studied typhimurium, agona and schwarzengrund isolates from dairy farms, and did not find particular sts associated with the presence of cmy- <dig>  concluding that cmy- <dig> positive isolates evolved independently by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . our data strongly suggest that in the mexican typhimurium population pcmy- <dig> is associated with multidrug resistance and is harboured only by st <dig> genotypes.

integrons as source of strain diversity
in this work we found four types of integrons encompassing nine different genes . seven of them were genes encoding antimicrobial resistance determinants well known to be associated with integrons in the enterobactariaceae  <cit> , and two were open reading frames with unknown function but also previously reported as gene cassettes  <cit> . to a large extent, the presence of integrons and plasmids defined the distinctive features of the main genetic subgroups, and provided strain diversity to an otherwise almost uniform population. these elements are known to be an integral part of the mobile or floating genome, and represent a fundamental resource for bacterial evolution  <cit> .

the two integrons designated in this study as ip- <dig> and ip- <dig> have been found in several salmonella serovars , and in other enterobacteriaceae, such as e. coli  <cit> . in a recent study these integrons were detected in three staphylococcus species isolated in china  <cit> , providing evidence of the successful spread of this integrons around the world and across bacterial phyla. blast searches showed the presence of the dfra <dig>  orff and aada <dig> integron in  <dig> isolates proceeding from proteobacteria  and firmicutes . the majority of the nucleotide sequences from these isolates were identical, suggesting that this integron has been recently acquired by a broad range of bacterial species. in many of these cases the location of the integron in plasmids has been documented, in agreement with the results found in the present study, which may account for its widespread distribution.

in contrast to prior evidence of horizontal transfer of dfra <dig>  orff and aada <dig> across bacterial lineages, in the present study we found that the distribution of this integron was not random across chromosomal backgrounds, since these were found only in st <dig> isolates. a similar situation was observed for sgi <dig>  for which a rather narrow distribution was observed , despite the proved mobility of sgi <dig>  <cit> . our results provide evidence for the clonal dissemination of the island rather than lateral transfer among diverse genotypes. the association of pstv with isolates harbouring sgi <dig> has been previously described  <cit> . taken together, these results point out that although this mexican typhimurium population is exposed to a broad genetic pool of accessory genes, there are associations and restrictions among genomic backgrounds and the environmental floating genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of core and accessory genes in mexican typhimurium isolates allowed us to identify genetic subgroups within the population. we found strong statistical associations among chromosomal genotypes and accessory genes. the general patterns of association can be summarized as follows: 1) the isolates harbouring pstv were st <dig> or st <dig>  2) all the isolates with sgi <dig> were st <dig> and most carried pstv, 3) all the isolates harbouring pcmy- <dig> were st <dig>  and 4) all ip- <dig> were carried by st <dig> isolates. the low genetic diversity and the clonal pattern of descent of accessory elements could be explained by a combination of evolutionary processes. this study provides information about the importance of the accessory genome in generating genetic variability within a bacterial population.
