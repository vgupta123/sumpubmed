BACKGROUND
the salmon louse lepeophtheirus salmonis  is an ectoparasitic copepod that feeds on the mucus, skin and blood of salmonid fishes in the marine environment. through its feeding action, l. salmonis leads to stress
 <cit>  and in severe untreated cases, open wounds and death of the host fish
 <cit> . within the atlantic salmon  and rainbow trout  aquaculture industry that is primarily conducted in marine cages, l. salmonis infections cause highly significant economic losses
 <cit> . in addition, due to the rapid expansion of aquaculture, the evolutionary dynamics of the relationship between l. salmonis and its hosts has changed
 <cit> . furthermore, there is evidence that l. salmonis is associated with declines of wild salmonid populations
 <cit> , mortality in the marine environment
 <cit> , and modifications of life history traits such as the age of return from the sea
 <cit> . as a consequence, lice control regimes have been put into place to reduce the level of sea lice infestation in marine farms.

a range of integrated methods are currently employed or being developed to control infestations of sea lice on salmonids in marine farms
. however, the industry continues to rely heavily upon the use of a few certified pesticides to remove lice from infested fish. this is not considered as a sustainable approach
 <cit>  due to a high risk of resistance development. currently, over  <dig> arthropod pest-species are documented as having developed resistance to pesticides
 <cit> , and l. salmonis, as for arthropods with short generation times and high reproduction rates, has a strong capacity to adapt to new environmental constraints. indeed, l. salmonis is known for developing resistance to chemical treatments
, and loss of efficiency has been reported for a number of chemicals, for example organophosphates
 <cit>  and pyrethroids
 <cit> , and no new chemicals have been introduced since  <dig> in norway when slice® came on the market. during the past ten years, the main pesticide used for treating lice infestations in the north-atlantic has been slice® emamectin benzoate 
 <cit> . emamectin benzoate is an avermectin where the target is gamma-aminobutyrate  and glutamate-gated chloride channels 
 <cit> . however, the target site of this chemical in l. salmonis is not confirmed, and over reliance on the product has also led to the development of reduced sensitivity and resistance to emb in sea lice populations
.

despite thorough efforts to unravel the mechanisms behind the development of pesticide resistance in l. salmonis
 <cit> , little is known about the genetics and genomics of this species at the population level. whether resistance to pesticides has developed in l. salmonis in multiple farms and regions in parallel, or has developed in one location and spread thereafter, is completely unknown. development of resistance in a pest population submitted to intense control is however expected to significantly alter the pattern of allelic frequencies around the positively selected genomic region
 <cit> . in the case of the salmon louse, addressing this issue is not only essential for the development of management guidelines, it also has a high level of relevance to questions regarding the evolutionary relationships among lice throughout the atlantic. this is because the question of population division remains a subject that has not been resolved, with previous studies being hampered by either a limited number of samples
, or limited numbers of polymorphic loci
 <cit> .

in order to address pesticide resistance development and dispersal, in addition to evolutionary connectivity among l. salmonis throughout the north atlantic, we developed a 6 k snp array, and used it to genotype geographically distinct samples . the primary aim of the present study was to address the following questions: 1- does l. salmonis display any population structure throughout the north atlantic? 2- is it possible to detect contemporary evolution linked with pesticide resistance development in l. salmonis? 3- is it possible to estimate how fast and how far advantageous mutations, such as those conveying pesticide resistance, can be spread throughout the atlantic?figure  <dig>

RESULTS
snp array
a 6 k snp array was produced for l. salmonis, based on an initial set of  <dig>  polymorphic sites detected in five pooled samples of l. salmonis originating from five regions of the north atlantic. among the  <dig> snps selected for inclusion on the array,  <dig> were selected to cover the genome with an average interval of 100 kb ,  <dig> were selected to cover a few larger scaffolds with average inter-snp interval of 10 kb , and  <dig> were selected based upon being located in or close to putative genes, based on matches to expressed sequence tag  regions. in addition,  <dig> snps were selected to provide a potential diagnostic tool to differentiate between populations throughout the atlantic .

after production,  <dig> of the original  <dig> snps  were successfully converted into on-chip assays including  <dig> diagnostic ,  <dig> est ,  <dig> ld , and  <dig>  genome distributed.

the snp array was then used to genotype dna collected from  <dig> individuals sampled from  <dig> commercial farms situated in the north atlantic . after automatic clustering and manual validation, the average sample call rate was  <dig> %, as was the average snp call rate. of the  <dig> from  <dig> snps,  <dig>  were monomorphic,  <dig>  displayed evidence of secondary snps within the flanking sequence making genotype calls unreliable, and  <dig>  assays failed. data from these three snp categories, totaling  <dig> assays, was excluded from the present study. the remaining  <dig> snps were further categorized as showing typical biallelic distribution with good cluster separation , showing a tight but distinct cluster distribution between allelotypes and requiring manual validation , and  <dig>  presenting some evidence of atypical clustering and also demanding manual checking. in a parallel project to the present study, a genetic linkage map was constructed  which included  <dig> of the successfully genotyped snps. data from these  <dig> snps are included in the present study .

population structure
to infer the genetic distance among populations, f statistics were calculated, both pair wise, for all pairs of sampling sites, and globally, to assess the collective genetic distance among all regions. the value of global fst among regions ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  per snp, with an average fst =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  across all snps. only 2% of the snps displayed fst values larger than  <dig> , and 90% displayed fst values smaller than  <dig>  . thus, north atlantic populations of l. salmonis displayed low genetic differentiation to each other. significantly, snps displaying the highest genetic distances among samples were not evenly distributed throughout the genome. these markers were grouped on three genomic regions of linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . when comparing pair-wise genetic distances and geographical distances, no snp displayed significant correlation between geographical distance and pair wise fst.figure  <dig>

in addition to f statistics, the genotypes of all  <dig> individuals on the neutral markers were analyzed with bayesian clustering implemented in structure
 <cit> , and with the r package adegenet
 <cit>  using the “find.clusters” function. with those two approaches, the parameter k, which stands for the number of populations or clusters in the dataset, was tested for values from k =  <dig> to  <dig>  both log likelihood of the data calculated by structure and the bayesian information criterion  calculated from adegenet reached a minimum value  for k =  <dig> as the number of clusters in the data. the two approaches gave consistent results, and indicated that l. salmonis consists of one single population throughout the north atlantic.

outlier detection
to infer the presence of snps under positive selection in the studied sets of samples, the genotypes of all individuals from twelve sampling sites were scanned for outlier markers using five different approaches. while the five scans gave slightly different results ,  <dig> markers were detected as being under positive selection in three or more scans out of five, and  <dig> snps were detected as neutral markers in all five scans. the l. salmonis linkage map revealed that most markers under positive selection were located on two genomic regions: one region on lg <dig> between  <dig> and 100 cm , and a second region on lg <dig> between  <dig> and 75 cm . of the  <dig> markers identified as being under positive selection,  <dig> were located on lg <dig>   <dig> were located on lg <dig>  and  <dig> were located on lg <dig>  all other linkage groups were exempt from outlier snps under selection.table  <dig>

population demography
despite the pattern of linkage disequilibrium  being constant over most of the genome, we observed local disturbance of ld in most populations on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  in the same regions where snps under positive selection were clustered . ld was tested for each marker pair, and the average correlation coefficient between pairs of loci was r2 =  <dig> . with the exception of two genomic regions under selection, this value of ld was constant across the genome, and only regions covered by dense snps, selected for short interval of 10 kb displayed higher ld, with an average of r2 =  <dig> . the effective population size  was estimated independently in each sampling site from a sample of  <dig> unlinked snps. the estimated ne ranged between  <dig> and infinity , with canada displaying the smallest population sizes, between ne =  <dig> and ne =  <dig>  whereas south norwegian populations seemed to have the largest effective size with an infinite estimate. an infinite estimate is simply interpreted as a large population

genomic regions affected by directional selection
the clustering of snps under positive selection on two genomic regions, on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition with the local disturbance of ld pattern on these same regions, suggested that there might have been selective sweeps of beneficial alleles in the studied populations. the presence of selective sweeps was tested by scanning the genome for i) regions of reduced variability and ii) local pattern of high linkage disequilibrium. this was performed with two statistics, respectively clr 
 <cit>  and omega
 <cit> . both clr and omega reported snps displaying a significant  pattern of selective sweep along the genome. a selective sweep was identified in a genomic region of lg <dig> by both clr and omega in sampling site s <dig> , and by omega only in sites f <dig>  f <dig>  s <dig>  and i <dig> . a second selective sweep was identified in a region of lg <dig> by both clr and omega in sampling site s <dig> , i <dig>  i <dig> and by omega only in sites n <dig> and n <dig> .

in sample s <dig>   <dig> snps  were identified as outliers  by both clr and omega statistic .

the selective sweep on lg <dig> covered a genomic region of 2 cm,  i.e., a genomic region in which chromosome recombination would occur in 2% on the individuals in each generation, while the sweep on lg <dig> covered a 5 cm region. .

reconstruction of the marker phases under the selective sweep regions revealed that some haplotypes were present in high frequency  in samples from all regions . moreover, we observed that the same haplotype sequence was found in high frequency, in sampling sites that are geographically distant by thousands of kilometers. for example, on lg <dig>  between  <dig> and 67 cm, the same haplotype “00001011010100111000000100000” was shared with a frequency from 10%, and up to 46% in most regions from norway to canada. to test whether this pattern was specific for this region displaying a selective sweep, we also reconstructed haplotypes of similar size in  <dig> neutral genomic regions in all sampling sites. among all neutral genomic regions, and all sampling sites, the most frequent haplotype was present in 3% of the population. by comparing the frequency of the most common haplotype in neutral genomic regions versus regions displaying selective sweeps, we show here that the observed haplotype frequency under region displaying selective sweeps is not likely to happen by chance in a neutral region of the genome.figure  <dig>

gene annotation
matches for coding dna were found in the genomic regions under positive selection, in  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds on lg <dig> and lg <dig> respectively. those scaffolds were  <dig> kb length on average, and covered together  <dig>  mb on lg <dig> and  <dig>  mb on lg <dig>  the number of predicted genes was respectively  <dig> and  <dig> in the two regions . functional annotation from blast hits revealed that some of these genes could play a role in drug resistance mechanisms. this was the case for q96j <dig> an atp-binding cassette  transporter protein predicted near marker c <dig>  on lg <dig>  q28fi <dig>  a cytochrome b <dig> domain-containing protein predicted near marker c <dig>  on lg  <dig>  or p <dig> and p <dig>  two potassium voltage-gated channel proteins predicted on lg  <dig> near markers c <dig> , and c <dig>  respectively .

despite showing a weaker signals for selective sweep than the reported regions on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  one genomic region on lg <dig> did gather an important number of snps with high fst values . moreover, a portion of lg <dig> between  <dig> and 31 cm showed significant signal for selective sweeps in the faeroe island and shetland samples . this region was annotated following the same protocol as for the two previous regions. matches for coding dna were found for  <dig> scaffolds within which  <dig> genes were predicted. among those,  <dig> gene  coded for acetycholinesterase . this is the target for organophosphates and could be involved in resistance as a knock down mutation.

association between selective sweep regions and drug resistance
a possible link between the detected selective sweeps and pesticide resistance was investigated for emb, the most commonly used pesticide for reducing infestations of l. salmonis on farmed salmonids in the atlantic in the period  <dig> to  <dig>  which is the time-line when samples for this study were collected from commercial farms. to achieve this, a further set of  <dig> individuals representing  <dig> full sibling families displaying differential sensitivity to emb
 <cit>  was genotyped on the snp array. the dataset was split into two separate groups of individuals; 5 f <dig> families originated from crosses between resistant and susceptible strains, and 7 f <dig> families were crosses between parents of undetermined susceptibility to the chemical. the offspring of each family were exposed to emb, and the status of each individual was reported as dead or alive after exposure
 <cit> . association between haplotypes at three consecutive markers and emb sensitivity was investigated by fitting a hierarchical generalized linear model with the r package hglm
 <cit> . the dispersion parameter for the random genetic effect  demonstrates that a broad region around the selective sweep on linkage group  <dig> had a strong and significant  contribution to the variation in emb resistance. in addition to lg <dig>   <dig> other genomic regions displayed significant association with emb resistance in the f <dig> dataset, on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in the f <dig> dataset, significant associations were found only on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  with generally lower values than in the f <dig> dataset .figure  <dig>

extrapolation of selection time frame
in lg <dig>  we detected conserved haplotypes on a 5 cm region, which corresponds to a genomic region where chromosome recombination would occur with 5% frequency every generation i.e. once every  <dig> meiosis. assuming the most drastic selection scenario where the frequency of the advantageous variant is nearly 100% in the population after a punctual selection event , the frequency of a 5 cm haplotype associated to this mutation would decrease by 5% every generation following selection. a lapse of  <dig> generations would thus be needed to observe a decrease of haplotype frequency to 46%  and, similarly,  <dig> generations to decrease to 10%.

discussion
population structure
the population genomic structure of l. salmonis throughout the atlantic ocean was investigated using f statistics
 <cit> , principal component
 <cit> , and bayesian clustering analysis
 <cit>  on genetic data from > <dig> snps and  <dig> sets of samples from six regions. these analyses did not reveal any geographical genetic structure of l. salmonis throughout the north atlantic. the overall global fst value was very low, with 98% of the markers displaying fst lower than  <dig> . furthermore, no significant correlation between genetic distance, measured as fst, and geographical distance, were detected. both bayesian clustering and principal component analyses suggested k =  <dig> as the most likely number of clusters in the samples. previous studies of population genetic structure of l. salmonis throughout the atlantic have revealed contrasting results, ranging from highly significant genetic differentiation among nearby farms, to no or little structure throughout the entire north atlantic. however, many of these earlier studies have been hindered by technical challenges, low sample sizes, low numbers of polymorphic markers, or combinations of these challenges
. nevertheless, the most rigorous of the earlier studies, using data from four mitochondrial dna  genes
 <cit> , and microsatellite markers on large numbers of samples
 <cit>  have all revealed statistically weak or non-significant genetic differentiation throughout the atlantic. the results of these former studies together with the present population genomic analysis strongly suggest that l. salmonis is characterized by a single panmictic population throughout the north atlantic. the most likely mechanism for the absence of isolation by distance in such a large geographical area is transport by the salmon host. wild atlantic salmon migrating from rivers located on both sides of the atlantic are known to mix on distant feeding grounds in the high seas of the atlantic ocean
 <cit> . seaward migrating smolts originating from these american and european rivers may often be infected by salmon lice in their respective coastal zones, and thus transport these to the offshore feeding grounds where cross-infection of salmon from other geographic regions can occur. such a mechanism would explain the lack of isolation by distance reported here. this hypothesis is further supported by the short time frame needed for an advantageous mutation to spread in the whole north atlantic as reported here.

population demography
in several sites, the estimate  of the effective population size was infinite. this is usually interpreted as a signal of a large population where genetic drift is unlikely to be of major influence on the evolutionary properties of the population. the estimate of infinity occurs because the method implemented in ldne
 <cit> , as other methods for estimating ne, depends on a signal that is a function of 1/ne
 <cit> . as a consequence, the precision in estimating ne is good for small populations, but the method has difficulties in distinguishing between large and infinite populations.

among the  <dig> sampling sites studied here, nê varied between  <dig> and infinity. this estimation remains imprecise, but is sufficient to suggest that a high proportion of the population inheriting large haplotype segments from a common ancestor, as observed in this study, is unlikely to happen by chance.

genomic regions affected by directional selection
selective sweeps are the signature of a strong selection event where the incremented frequency of a selected locus in a population is accompanied by hitchhiking of the flanking genomic regions
 <cit> . the size of a genomic region affected by hitchhiking depends upon the recombination rate and the strength of the selection. in cases of high recombination rate and weak selection, the area may be small and thus, difficult to detect with a moderate density of molecular markers. in the literature, occurrence of selective sweeps have been reported in extensively studied organisms for which molecular resources are highly available, such as human
 <cit> , or drosophila
, and in domestic species for which directional selection was very strong in the recent history
. another example of reported selective sweeps is the development of chemical resistance in pest species or human disease vectors that are subject to intense population control
. in this latter example, the selection pressure is often very strong and led the selected variant to colonize the population in a short period of time. such examples of human-induced evolution appear to be easier to detect as they happen on a contemporary time scale where recombination has not had the chance to erode the haplotype segments in the hitchhiking regions. in such cases, selective sweeps may be detectable with a medium density of molecular markers. this last case scenario has remarkable similarities with the results presented here, which re-enforces the main hypothesis of selection driven by drug resistance.

combining two independent methods increases the power of sweep detection
 <cit> . here, we focused on genomic regions where selective sweeps were reported using both the clr and omega methods. using these criteria, two selective sweeps were identified on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. these two genomic regions were already identified to contain a large number of the outlier markers identified as under positive selection, and displayed local disturbance in ld. it is thus highly likely that these two regions contain one or several advantageous mutations that were positively selected in l. salmonis.

the two selective sweep regions contained large haplotypes with frequencies higher that 10% within several sampling sites across the entire north atlantic. because the selection of an advantageous mutation can be accompanied by genetic hitchhiking
 <cit> , which creates ld patterns around the target of positive selection
 <cit> , it is not surprising that haplotypes under the regions where selective sweep were detected are present in high frequencies in each sample. this is an expected consequence of the stronger ld observed in those regions. interestingly, identical haplotypes were also frequent in geographically distant regions. the presence of selective sweeps coinciding with large haplotype segments conserved across distant localities strongly suggests that a de-novo mutation appeared between  <dig> to  <dig> generations before the sample used in the present study were collected. the causative mutation is likely to have occurred in one single geographical site, before being spread to the other regions rather than originating from multiple and independent selection events. this consolidates the conclusion above that l. salmonis is represented by a single panmictic population throughout the north atlantic, and importantly, demonstrates that alleles conveying resistance to pesticides may be quickly spread over very large areas in the marine environment. this unique documentation of genetic resistance dispersal in the ocean reveals a major challenge for the management of resistance development within the aquaculture industry in the entire atlantic. because resistance can quickly spread across the ocean, management of pesticide resistance in this parasite needs to be addressed on an ocean-wide level rather than on a regional level. moreover, due to the heterogeneous structure of the landscape where l. salmonis is evolving, with patches of high host density in salmon farms and coastal areas, and large areas of low host density in the offshore regions, standard population genetic models are likely to produce biased estimates of the evolutionary dynamics of this organism
 <cit> .

gene annotation
in order to better identify the possible targets of positive selection detected on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  the two genomic regions were annotated to identify sequences of coding dna together with the possible function of such sequences. the number of predicted genes on the scaffolds situated in the genomic regions under selection was  <dig> and  <dig> on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. functional annotation was obtained from blast hits
 <cit> . in most cases, blast from a given sequence returned several times the same gene in several organisms. in such cases, we reported the version of the gene that gave the best hit . one of those genes, q96j <dig>  reported on lg <dig>  codes for an atp binding cassette protein that has previously been described as multi-drug resistance associated protein
 <cit> . in addition, the p-glycoprotein , a member of the atp-binding cassette  transporter protein superfamily was recently reported for playing an important role in emb resistance
 <cit> . however, other studies could not establish significant correlation between pgp polymorphisms and emb susceptibility
 <cit> . a second candidate gene for drug resistance is q28fi <dig> on linkage group  <dig>  coding for cytochrome b <dig> domain-containing protein. cytochrome b <dig> is a known activator of cytochrome p450
 <cit> , which has documented insecticide resistance effects in several species
 <cit> . this is concordant with the fact that emb is one of the most extensively used chemical pesticides to control lice infestation in sea cages
 <cit> , and that intensive use of the substance led to development of resistance
.

because exposure to pesticides used for treating lice infestation is probably the strongest directional selection pressure applied to l. salmonis at the temporal scale of the present study, it is likely that the selective sweeps reported here are connected to positive selection on variants that provide better resistance to pesticides. the observations reported in the present paper would fit with this hypothesis: the region of the sweep on lg <dig> contains one candidate gene for a family of protein that has already been identified for playing a role in resistance to the most commonly used delousing chemical in salmon farms. moreover, the use of the same chemical in all regions, as it is the case for in-feed lice infestation treatment, is expected to induce a strong selection pressure on the same resistance locus in all regions. this second fact also coincides with our observations of haplotypes under selective sweeps that are highly conserved across distant regions of the north atlantic. together, those facts point at pesticide resistance as the most likely cause for the observed selective sweeps.

one genomic region on lg <dig> displayed a number of snps with high fst values , and was reported with significant signal for selective sweeps in faeroe island and shetland samples . within the  <dig> genes predicted in this region, one coded for acetycholinesterase, which is the well-known target for organophosphates. because it has been established that a variant type of acetylcholinesterase provides resistance to organophosphates in lice
 <cit> , it is possible that the high values of fst among sampling sites and the weak signal the of selective sweep reported on lg <dig> are due to an older event of selection for lice resistant to organophosphates. organophosphates were the only chemical used to control sea lice up to around  <dig> and major resistance problems occurred and left the chemical largely ineffective. however, due to emerging resistance against both emb and phyretroids, azametiphos  was reintroduced and have been used alone and in combination with other medicines during the last 6– <dig> years.

link between emb resistance and selective sweeps
the possible link between the detected selective sweeps and pesticide resistance was specifically investigated for emb, which is the most commonly used pesticide to control l. salmonis in the atlantic in the period 2000– <dig>  a genome-wide association analysis revealed that a broad region around the selective sweep of lg <dig> had a strong and significant contribution to the variation in emb resistance . this last analysis demonstrates a clear link between genetic variation on lg <dig> around the selective sweep region, and emb resistance. the selective sweep region on lg <dig> did however not show any link to emb resistance. this could indicate that despite coinciding with a coding sequence for a protein that has previously been described as multi-drug resistance associated
 <cit> , the selective sweep on lg <dig> is caused by another factor than resistance to emb. alternatively, we point out that the lice that were included in the genome wide association dataset were all sampled in south norway, whereas in the population genetic dataset only the samples from ireland, shetland and faeroe island displayed highly frequent haplotypes under the selective weep region on lg <dig>  it is thus possible that the variant under positive selection on lg <dig> were not present in the association dataset.

we also point out that the power to detect association between genomic regions and emb resistance was better in the f <dig> dataset than from the f <dig> cross between sensitive and resistant forms. in the f <dig> dataset,  <dig> genomic regions were significantly associated with the resistance while only two in the f <dig> data. when the same region was significantly associated in both datasets, the association score was larger in the f <dig> data.

an f <dig> intercross represents a notoriously better experimental design to maximize the genotypic variability in a population, while f <dig> crosses are not suitable for populations with fixed allelic frequencies. assuming that the resistant and sensitive lines had fixed allelic frequencies at loci associated with emb resistance, the resulting f <dig> hybrids would all be heterozygous at those loci, thus reducing to zero the genotypic variability of that population together with the power to associate genotypes to phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
we produced the first snp array for l. salmonis, and used it to genotype a set of geographically distinct samples in order to assess whether it was possible to identify signatures of pesticide resistance and dispersal, as well as to evaluate population genomic structure of this economically and ecologically important parasite. all results supported the hypothesis that this parasite is characterized by a single panmictic population through its distribution in the atlantic. importantly, the search for signatures of positive selection revealed two genomic regions under strong positive selection. both of the selective sweeps identified coincided with the coding sequence of one or several possible candidate genes for pesticide resistance. additionally, one genomic region on lg <dig> displayed a weak signal for selection, which may correspond to an older selective sweep caused by the development of resistance to organophosphates which have been used for a longer period. genome-wide association analysis revealed a strong link between the selective sweep on linkage group  <dig> and resistance to emb which was the most commonly used pesticide between years  <dig> to  <dig>  when the samples upon which the study is based were collected. the strong selective sweeps identified on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> were both characterized by haplotypes that were present in high frequency in samples from distant regions of the north atlantic. this last observation strongly suggests that l. salmonis has a high capacity to spread new advantageous mutations across continents in the time scale of just a few generations or years , thus corroborating concerns that pesticide resistance can develop and rapidly spread over large areas on an ecological time-scale. these results have very significant implications for the way in which pesticide resistance for l salmonis, and potentially other parasitic copepods, is managed in marine aquaculture.
