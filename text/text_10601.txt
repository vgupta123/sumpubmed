BACKGROUND
the burkholderia cepacia complex  is an ubiquitous and extremely versatile group of closely related gram-negative bacteria, currently divided into  <dig> species  <cit> . bcc bacteria emerged in the 1980s as opportunistic human pathogens responsible for devastating lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease  <cit> . bcc has also been shown to colonise natural habitats including agricultural soils, plant rhizospheres, and river waters  <cit> . the maize rhizosphere is a favourable niche for bcc bacteria, probably due to their ability to metabolise at high rates maize root exudates  <cit>  and has also been suggested to represent a natural reservoir of bacterial strains that may exhibit pathogenic traits  <cit> . a close association between maize roots and bcc has been observed in a number of different locations worldwide  <cit> . studies on bcc populations recovered from italian maize rhizosphere have shown the presence of several bcc species such as b. cepacia, b. cenocepacia , b. ambifaria, b. pyrrocinia, and bcc groups such as bcc <dig> and bcc <dig> suggesting possible novel plant associated species within the complex  <cit> . in mexico, where maize has traditionally been cultivated for thousands of years, b. cenocepacia  and b. vietnamiensis were isolated with other burkholderia species from the rhizosphere of local and commercial varieties of maize plants cultivated in distant geographical regions . 

the maize rhizosphere is a dynamic and active environment in which many factors may affect the diversity and activity of microbial communities  <cit> . the distribution of identical clones among bcc populations recovered from geographically disparate italian maize rhizospheres suggested that bacterial flow may occur among bcc populations of different geographic areas  <cit> . therefore, assessing the diversity of maize-rhizosphere associated bcc species in different and distant countries may provide critical insight into the population structure, evolution and ecology of such bcc populations. indexing allelic variation in sets of housekeeping genes provides a good basis for estimating overall levels of genotypic variation in microbial populations  <cit> . methods based on this principle, such as multilocus restriction typing , multilocus enzyme electrophoresis , and multilocus sequence typing , provide good insights into the genetic relationships among strains  <cit> . during the last decade, mlst has emerged as a powerful tool in studies of bcc epidemiology and population structure  <cit> . mlrt has a lower discrimination power than mlst, but acceptable turnaround time and lower cost make it really advantageous, especially for an 'in-house' initial genotype screening of isolates collected in large-scale  <cit> . furthermore, mlrt has been used to study the global epidemiology and the population structure of b. cenocepacia  <cit> , streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit>  and helicobacter pylori  <cit> , as well as to determine the genetic relationships among strains of neisseria meningitidis  <cit> , staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit>  and yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1a  <cit> . the successful application of mlrt in these studies and the excellent correlation with mlst results  <cit>  demonstrate its wide range of potential applications.

in the current study, we investigated the genetic relationships in b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> populations associated with roots of maize plants cultivated in two distant countries . assessment was carried out by applying the mlrt scheme specifically developed for b. cenocepacia  <cit>  also to bcc <dig> group, since it includes bacteria previously assigned to b. cenocepacia by means of reca polymorphism based tests  <cit> . we focused on b. cenocepacia iiib as it is widely spread in both italian and mexican rhizospheres , besides its importance as an opportunistic pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis  <cit> , and on the underappreciated bcc <dig> group as it has only been isolated from italian maize rhizosphere  <cit> , although its real distribution has most likely been masked by b. cenocepacia iiib. as the maize historically originates from mexico, we have chosen to compare representatives isolates of our italian b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> collections with mexican ones in order to provide new insights into maize-rhizosphere bacterial populations. in particular, we aimed to  describe the genetic structure of bacterial populations by evaluating the extent of linkage equilibrium between the different loci,  assess whether the geographic origin of isolated bacteria influences the extent of their genetic diversity, and  individuate the genetic similarities among the restriction types of b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> group.

RESULTS

for each of the five loci , amplified products of the expected size were obtained in each of the  <dig> bcc isolates . the number of different alleles present per locus in the b. cenocepacia iiib population included:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . while in the bcc <dig> population this differed slightly:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the frequency of each allele within each bacterial population is shown in figure  <dig>  in the b. cenocepacia iiib population, gyrb and cepir loci showed the highest diversity , while dsba and reca loci showed the lowest diversity ; in the bcc <dig> population, cepir and gyrb loci showed a high diversity , while no polymorphism was observed within reca locus . the mean genetic diversity  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for all b. cenocepacia iiib isolates and  <dig>   ±  <dig>  for all bcc <dig> isolates .

b the measure of linkage disequilibrium is performed by testing the null hypothesis :vd = ve, where vd is the variance calculated from the distribution of mismatch values of variance and ve is the variance expected for linkage equilibrium. p values are derived from parametric method  <cit>  and indicate the significance of linkage disequilibrium. if the ias  value differs significantly from zero, the null hypothesis of linkage equilibrium is rejected.

a restriction type  for each isolate was generated by combining information for each of the five loci. mlrt divided the  <dig> b. cenocepacia iiib and the  <dig> bcc <dig> isolates into  <dig> and  <dig> different rts, respectively . some bcc isolates from mexico and italy were found to share identical rts; i.e., rt- <dig> was shared by two b. cenocepacia iiib isolates  and rt- <dig> was shared by two bcc <dig> isolates . many rts were found to type more than one isolate within the italian bcc <dig> population  and the mexican bcc <dig> population  . this was also seen in the case of one rt in the b. cenocepacia iiib population  .

genetic relationships among isolates
using the eburst algorithm, clonal complexes or closely related rts were defined as groups in which each isolate is identical to at least one other isolate at four of the five loci. in addition, within each major clonal complex, the putative ancestral genotype was defined as the rt that differs from the largest number of other rts at only a single locus, and the single-locus variants  as the rts that differ from the ancestral genotype at only one locus. rts which differ from all other rts at more than two loci were designated as singleton rts.

within the b. cenocepacia iiib population,  <dig> isolates  were distinguished by  <dig> rts and grouped into four clonal complexes, while the remaining  <dig> isolates  were characterized as singleton rts. rt-4-complex, with rt <dig>  as its putative ancestral genotype, represented the major clonal complex since it included 42% of isolates , with rt  <dig> , rt  <dig> , rt  <dig> , and rt  <dig>  as slvs of the predicted primary founder. the other three clonal complexes included few isolates and then may be considered as doublets of rts . as far as the bcc <dig> group is concerned, the eburst algorithm grouped most of the bcc <dig> isolates  into one clonal complex, designated rt-104-complex, with rt <dig>  as putative ancestral genotype, while four isolates  were branded as four singleton rts. the rt-104-complex included  <dig> rts , with rt <dig>  and rt  <dig>  rt  <dig>  rt <dig>  rt <dig>  rt <dig> and rt <dig>  as slvs of the predicted primary founder .

the genetic relationships among isolates belonging to the major complexes of b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> populations  as well as to the other minor complexes and singletons are shown in figure  <dig>  the dendrogram constructed using the upgma algorithm in bionumerics revealed that all isolates were grouped in two main clusters, corresponding to the major eburst clonal complexes. the major cluster  included the bcc <dig> rt- <dig> clonal complex, while the cluster ii comprised the b. cenocepacia iiib rt- <dig> clonal complex. interestingly, within the cluster i, which mostly comprised the bcc <dig> isolates, the b. cenocepacia iiib eburst groups  <dig> and  <dig> were also present, while two bcc <dig> isolates  belonging to the rt- <dig> clonal complex fell within the cluster ii which mostly included b. cenocepacia iiib isolates.

standardized index of association  and population structure
evidence for recombination and clonality in b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> rhizosphere populations was assessed using standardized index of association . a ias value differing from zero characterizes clonal population , while a ias value close to zero characterizes freely recombining population . ias values including all rhizosphere isolates or single representatives of each rt were calculated separately to put in evidence bias due to epidemic structure for  the entire b. cenocepacia iiib population,  the italian b. cenocepacia iiib population,  the mexican b. cenocepacia iiib population,  the entire bcc <dig> population,  the italian bcc <dig> population, and  the mexican bcc <dig> population . in the b. cenocepacia iiib population, the value of ias calculated considering all  <dig> isolates differed significantly from zero  indicating a high level of linkage disequilibrium and a non-random association among alleles at different loci. ias decreased when only single representatives of each rt were included , suggesting a random association between alleles in some subgroups . in the bcc <dig> population, the ias value calculated including all  <dig> isolates was  <dig>  , indicating a linkage disequilibrium which disappeared when the analysis was repeated with each rt treated as an individual , suggesting a possible epidemic population structure in which occasional clones emerge and spread.

considering each bacterial population according to its geographic origin, a random association among the alleles  within the italian b. cenocepacia iiib population was found either when all isolates or each rt treated as an individual were considered ; conversely, the mexican b. cenocepacia iiib population showed linkage disequilibrium at both levels . linkage disequilibrium was also observed within the italian bcc <dig> population when all  <dig> isolates were considered ; conversely, when the analysis was restricted to rts taken as units, linkage equilibrium was found . within the mexican bcc <dig> maize rhizosphere population, linkage equilibrium was found either when all isolates or rts taken as units were considered .

discussion
in this study,  <dig> isolates belonging to the species b. cenocepacia iiib and the bcc <dig> group, recovered from maize rhizosphere in italy and mexico, were characterized by using mlrt, in order to investigate the genetic diversity and relationships of bacteria associated with maize cultivated in geographically distant locations. despite the clear relationship found between the geographic origin of isolates and grouping, identical rts and closely related isolates were observed in geographically distant regions . two main complexes were identified following eburst analysis, namely rt- <dig> for b. cenocepacia iiib and rt- <dig> for bcc <dig>  these two main clonal complexes included rts shared by both italian and mexican maize rhizospheres, suggesting some mixing of the genotypes between the two continental regions and excluding the possibility of any kind of geographic subspeciation in the formation of these two complexes. at the genus and species level, many prokaryotes have a cosmopolitan distribution in their respective habitats and the same genotypes have often been identified in similar habitats in different geographic areas  <cit> . the wide geographic distribution and substantial capability of burkholderia spp. to colonize diverse host plants was observed in distantly separated environments  <cit> , as well as genetic identity between bcc isolates of clinical and environmental origins recovered from different countries has been proved  <cit> . grouping isolates by eburst analysis is useful to better evaluate the rts distribution in natural population where highly similar rts are found, i.e. to elucidate the meaning of the presence of closely related strains in geographically separated maize rhizospheres in respect to niche specificity and adaptation. our finding that the majority of bcc <dig> isolates are part of rt-104-complex suggests that large networks of closely related bcc <dig> isolates colonize the maize rhizosphere of plants cultivated in italy and mexico. on the other hand, the presence of four clonal complexes and  <dig> singletons within the b. cenocepacia iiib population suggests that maize rhizosphere is commonly colonized by well adapted b. cenocepacia iiib clones rather than large networks of closely related isolates.

in spite of its lower discriminatory power in respect to mlst , mlrt provides useful data for typing and structure population investigations  <cit> . previous mlst analyses performed on  <dig> italian bcc isolates examined in the present work indicate a good correspondence between rts and sequence types  for certain isolates: i.e., three bcc <dig> isolates, typed by rt  <dig>  had st  <dig>  and four isolates, typed by rt  <dig>  had st <dig>  <cit> . conversely, mlst and mlrt data do not always match and the same st for different rts as well as different sts for the same rt were occasionally found  <cit> . considering that mlrt and mlst do not rely on the same loci, we cannot strictly correlate our mlrt results with the mlst sequence database. indeed, a previous study on s. aureus isolates  <cit>  revealed that mlrt performed on the same seven loci used in mlst captures about 95% of the discrimination power of mlst, and demonstrated that mlrt approach represents a convenient alternative to mlst. the analyses of mlrt data using tools developed for mlst permit to assess clonality/recombination in our maize-rhizosphere populations. this is an important feature when assessing the risks for human health posed by opportunistic pathogens present in the natural environment. bacterial population structures can vary from the extremes of strictly clonal to panmictic, with most populations occupying a middle ground where recombination is significant in the evolution but the emergence of epidemic clonal lineages can also occur  <cit> . the difference in the ias values between complete and corrected data sets  suggests that both b. cenocepacia and bcc <dig> group have an epidemic population structure in which occasional clones emerge and spread. both populations are recombining in the long term but a few rts have recently become abundant and widespread  <cit> . similar "epidemic" population structure has been observed in global collections of b. cenocepacia  <cit> , and may occur continuously in microbial populations not affected by the severe selective constraints imposed by human activity  <cit> . the ias values calculated on a subset of isolates chosen on the basis of geographical origin evidenced a population structure different from that obtained considering the entire dataset. concerning the bcc <dig> group, the italian population behaved like the whole bcc <dig> population, showing linkage equilibrium only when rts were taken as units , while the mexican population showed linkage equilibrium at all levels . regarding the b. cenocepacia iiib populations, the italian one was freely recombining, while the mexican one had a clonal structure. nevertheless, the ias values of the mexican population are quite low, which may indicate that some recombination occurs. recombination has had an important role in the long-term evolution of b. cenocepacia and it was also found among strains from different locations  <cit> . most likely, the efficiency of genetic exchange mechanisms, due to bcc inherent genomic plasticity, together with ecological factors, play a crucial role.

the use of a common mlrt scheme for both b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> group allowed to compare their genetic variability, relatedness, and population structure also at interspecific level. b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> populations shared identical alleles but not the same rts. in the upgma tree, where the genetic similarities between the restriction profiles of both b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> group were represented, the isolates were grouped into two main clusters  corresponding to their taxonomic status and eburst clonal complexes; i.e., cluster i for b. cenocepacia iiib and rt-4-complex, and cluster ii for bcc <dig> group and rt-104-complex. within each cluster, the occasional presence of few isolates belonging to the other bcc species is not surprising since bcc <dig> and b. cenocepacia iiib are closely related, and indeed bcc <dig> was previously included in the b. cenocepacia species. upgma performed with only the isolates included in the rt- <dig> and rt- <dig> clonal complexes gave rise to a dendrogram showing two clusters exactly corresponding to them , confirming the correspondence between eburst and upgma grouping. finally, the finding of a clear relationship between grouping and maize cultivar suggests that maize cultivars could influence rhizosphere bacterial diversity probably due to the different chemical composition of root exudates. in fact, it is well known that plant root bacterial communities are very sensitive to environmental conditions and are more strongly influenced by plant species and different cultivars rather than by other environmental factors such as soil type and agricultural practices  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data demonstrate a wide dispersal of certain b. cenocepacia iiib and bcc <dig> isolates in mexican and italian maize rhizospheres. despite the clear relationship found between the geographic origin of isolates and grouping, identical rts and closely related isolates were observed in geographically distant regions. the differences in rhizosphere habitats and/or maize varieties between italy and mexico may result in certain selective pressure which may preferably promote some genotypes within each local microbial population, favouring the spread of a single clone above the rest of the recombinant population. investigation of other important population genetic forces, such as gene flow and natural selection, with more extensive and/or focused sampling, would provide more insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of bcc populations.
