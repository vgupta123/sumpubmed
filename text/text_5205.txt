BACKGROUND
although glycolysis is highly conserved, this central metabolic pathway is modified extensively during spermatogenesis. there are several glycolytic isozymes with restricted expression in the male germline including spermatogenic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase   <cit> , phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig>   <cit> , and two aldolase a-related isozymes  in mouse  <cit> . other unique sperm isozymes in this pathway are generated by alternative splicing, including hexokinase  <dig> variants   <cit> , aldoa_v <dig>  <cit> , and a pyruvate kinase muscle form isozyme   <cit> . there is also evidence that other glycolytic enzymes have unique functional or structural properties in mammalian sperm, including glucose phosphate isomerase   <cit> , triose phosphate isomerase   <cit> , enolase   <cit> , and phosphofructokinase   <cit> .

sperm motility is dependent upon the production of high levels of atp in the flagellum  <cit> . targeted disruption of genes encoding two spermatogenic cell-specific glycolytic enzymes  demonstrates an essential role of these enzymes in sperm motility and male fertility in mice  <cit> . ldhc, which encodes a germ cell-specific ldh isozyme for the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, is also required  <cit> . a recent study of  <dig> patients with male factor infertility found that approximately 81% exhibit defects in sperm motility, with 19% having no other defects in sperm count or morphology  <cit> . the expression of genes that promote high sperm motility can increase reproductive fitness, while disruptive mutations in genes essential for sperm motility can hinder proper fertilization, leading to infertility. in humans, genes involved in spermatogenesis and sperm motility demonstrate the strongest evidence for positive selection, and proteins involved in reproduction are among the most rapidly evolving genes across multiple species  <cit> .

the glycolytic pathway is comprised of ten enzymes, each encoded by a multigene family  <cit> . seven of these gene families have two to five intron-containing genes, while the gpi <dig>  tpi <dig>  and pgk families each have only one. within a family, each gene encodes a different isoform with a unique expression pattern  <cit> . many of these gene families arose by multiple rounds of segmental gene duplication in the last  <dig> million years  <cit> . genes encoding spermatogenic cell-specific glycolytic isozymes were generated by either segmental gene duplication  or retrotransposition   <cit> . pgk <dig> represent an ancient retrotransposition event shared by all eutherian mammals, while aldoart <dig> and aldoart <dig> are only found in the rodent lineage and are much more recent  <cit> . in addition, frequent retrotransposition of the gapdh and aldoa genes has been reported in both human and mouse, based on an abundance of pseudogenes  <cit> .

theoretically, retrotransposition can occur in any cell type, but the retrotransposition event is only transmitted to future generations when it takes place in the germline  <cit> . retrotransposition is facilitated by repetitive elements , resulting in the creation of pseudogenes or retrogenes  <cit> . in the human lineage most ltr elements have been extinct for over  <dig> million years. however, line elements are still active and are, therefore, thought to be responsible for most retroposed mrna sequences  <cit> . the proteins encoded by line elements provide both endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities required for retrotransposition. these proteins, orf <dig> and orf <dig>  are expressed in testicular germ cells undergoing meiosis, a period when retrotransposition is thought to occur  <cit> . in fact, retrotransposition is responsible for the creation of many retrogenes expressed only during the meiotic and/or haploid phases of spermatogenesis, including but not limited to pgk <dig>  g6pd <dig>  and pabp <dig>  <cit> . at least 10% of retroposed sequences with open reading frames  are transcribed during spermatogenesis  <cit> . positive selection of sperm proteins, combined with frequent retrotransposition to create genes encoding sperm-specific proteins, results in the faster evolution of genes involved in sperm function  <cit> .

based on the existence of pgk <dig> and aldoa-related retrogenes and their restricted expression during spermatogenesis, we hypothesized that there may be additional retrogenes that encode novel sperm glycolytic enzymes. therefore, we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis to identify all human and mouse retroposed sequences that are derived from genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. we analyzed the gene structure of these sequences and determined which copies maintain orfs, are transcribed, and may encode sperm-specific isoforms of glycolytic enzymes. unique features of sperm glycolytic isozymes may be important for localization of this pathway in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum or for altered regulation or kinetic properties that may be required to sustain sperm metabolism and motility in this highly polarized cell. taken together, identification of all sperm-specific glycolytic enzymes will improve our understanding of sperm metabolism at a molecular level and may provide insights regarding the rapid evolution of genes required for reproduction.

RESULTS
frequent retrotransposition of orthologous genes encoding glycolytic enzymes occurred independently in the mouse and human genomes
there are  <dig> intron-containing genes in the ten gene families that compose the glycolytic pathway . we used blast to identify sequences with significant sequence similarity to each parent gene . this analysis identified retroposed sequences in the human and mouse genomes in every family of glycolytic enzymes, except phosphofructokinase . major conclusions from this analysis are:

the position column indicates chromosomal location denoted as "chromosome number:position ". the ret. seq. column indicates whether retroposed sequences were identified for each parent gene. the number in parentheses next to "yes" in this column indicates the total number of retroposed sequences that match the parent gene. we identified a total of  <dig> retroposed sequences matching glycolytic enzymes in the human genome and  <dig> in the mouse genome.

▪ retrotransposition of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes is frequent. we identified  <dig> matching retroposed sequences in the human genome and  <dig> in the mouse genome. our analysis confirms that the mouse genome contains significantly more retroposed sequences than the human genome  <cit> .

▪ as a rule, only one gene within each family is retroposed .

▪ the same orthologous gene is retroposed in the human and mouse genomes. this is always true in cases where there is more than one retroposed sequence. the two exceptions to this rule, hexokinase  and phosphoglycerate mutase , have a single retroposed sequence in one or both species. in the human genome hk <dig> is retroposed, while hk <dig> is retroposed in the mouse genome. there is also a single pgam <dig> retroposed sequence in mouse in addition to multiple retroposed sequences for pgam <dig> in both species.

▪ the location of retroposed sequences in the human  and mouse  genomes appears to be random. there is no region or chromosome with an overrepresentation of retroposed sequences. there is also evidence for segmental gene duplication of retrotransposed sequences.

▪ retrotransposition events occurred independently in each lineage following the divergence of primates and rodents. phylogenetic analysis was inconclusive in determining the strict order of retrotransposition events due to the high levels of sequence identity between retroposed sequences and parent genes. analysis of genes flanking retroposed sequences confirmed that these events occurred independently in each species .

▪ human retroposed sequences derived from genes encoding glycolytic enzymes are more divergent from their parent genes than mouse retroposed sequences . figure  <dig> groups retroposed sequences matching glycolytic enzymes by the percent nucleotide substitution in the entire sequence  compared to the parent gene. human retroposed sequences are 82-100% identical to their parent genes, with a mean nucleotide identity of  <dig> %. mouse retroposed sequences have the same range of nucleotide identity, although the mean identity is  <dig> %.

3-6% of retroposed sequences have orfs
 <dig> % of human and  <dig> % of mouse retroposed sequences derived from genes encoding glycolytic enzymes contain orfs equivalent to the full-length orf present in the parent gene . this value includes the previously identified pgk <dig>  aldoart <dig>  and aldoart <dig> retrogenes. in this study we identified five new retroposed sequences with orfs in the human genome and seven new retroposed sequences with orfs in the mouse genome . numbers next to each gene structure indicate the percent identity of the coding region in each retroposed sequence compared to the parent gene.

three of the five human retroposed sequences with orfs  showed substantial divergence from their parent genes at both the nucleotide  and amino acid level . for example, the orf of pgam1-rs <dig> is only  <dig> % identical at the nucleotide level and encodes  <dig> unique amino acid residues. the mouse sequences we identified are more similar to their parent genes  that humans sequences . six of seven mouse retroposed sequences had orfs with >99% nucleotide and amino acid identity to their parent genes . two of these sequences, pgk1-rs <dig> and pgk1-rs <dig>  had less than 99% nucleotide identity in the 3'utr due to a 5-base-pair insertion that we did not detect in rt-pcr analyses of testis transcripts . gpi-rs <dig> was the only mouse retroposed sequence that showed less than 99% sequence identity at the nucleotide  and amino acid level . these results indicate that several retroposed sequences matching glycolytic enzymes in both the human and mouse genomes have orfs, supporting possible expression of these sequences.

detection of splice variants in the glycolytic enzyme parent genes
analysis of retroposed sequences derived from glycolytic enzyme genes support the expression of alternative transcripts from the parent genes in both the human and mouse. two retroposed sequences in humans  suggest alternative splicing of internal exons . for example, tpi1-rs <dig> is missing  <dig> full consecutive exons and part of a third, but still contains sequence that matches part of the last tpi <dig> exon. alternative splicing is also supported by two mouse retroposed sequences . for example, eno1-rs <dig> matches full-length eno <dig>  except for a deletion of half of exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> and half of exon  <dig> . the remaining 3'utr is maintained, without the coding sequence of the last exon. however, we did not detect expression of these splice variants in published est libraries.

detection of n-terminal extensions in the glycolytic enzyme parent genes
some spermatogenic-cell specific glycolytic enzymes are modified through the addition of amino acid residues at the n-terminus, including gapdhs, aldoa_v <dig> and aldoart <dig>  <cit> . our previous analysis supported the retrotransposition of an alternative splice variant  to produce a novel gene encoding an n-terminal extension   <cit> . in this study, we found that multiple mouse and human retroposed sequences have upstream start codons, supporting the expression of transcripts that encode additional glycolytic enzymes with n-terminal extensions. three human sequences  and nine mouse sequences  contain upstream start codons . in most cases, comparison of the amino acid sequence in these n-terminal extensions reveal a unique origin for these extensions that is independent from the parent genes , since the alignment does not show a high level of identity. five retroposed sequences matching pkm <dig> in mice contain n-terminal extensions. previous studies detected a larger pkm <dig> protein in boar and mouse sperm  <cit> . proteomic evidence from boar sperm suggests extension of the n-terminus by at least five amino acids  <cit> . our sequence analysis of pkm <dig> retropseudogenes with upstream start codons in the mouse genome shows partial agreement with the previously identified five-amino-acid extension, but does not clearly elucidate the start codon responsible for the larger protein product detected in sperm .

novel orfs with divergent sequences are not expressed in human testis
our expression analyses in both species focused on retroposed sequences with less than 99% identity at the nucleotide level and did not include the large number of sequences derived from gapdh. due to high sequence similarity at the nucleotide level, we used single strand conformation polymorphism  gel electrophoresis to examine potential expression of three retroposed sequences in human testis . in this method rt-pcr products are denatured into two strands and separated based upon individual nucleotide differences, allowing us to distinguish between sequences with very high levels of identity. expression of protamine  <dig> , a spermatid-specific transcript, was detected in human cdna preparations, confirming complete spermatogenesis in the pooled testes tissues used for rna isolation. we used genomic dna to identify the migration pattern of the pcr products amplified from the retroposed sequences . with primers specific for tpi-rs <dig>  pgam1-rs <dig>  and eno1-rs <dig>  rt-pcr did not amplify products from human testis rna that match the retroposed sequence fragments amplified from genomic dna . therefore, we did not detect testis expression of the human retroposed sequences with orfs that were analyzed in this study.

expression of an alternative gpi <dig> transcript in mouse spermatogenic cells
gpi1-rs <dig> maintains an orf, despite missing two internal exons . the open reading frame of gpi1-rs <dig> suggests the expression of this retroposed sequence and/or a gpi <dig> splice variant missing exons  <dig> and  <dig> . rt-pcr expression analysis in mouse tissues revealed a testis-specific transcript of glucose phosphate isomerase, representative of gpi1_v <dig> and/or gpi1-rs <dig> . this transcript was also detected in both pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids isolated from mouse testis, but not in later germ cells  or sertoli cells. the same band was detected in human testis, but due to the absence of gpi1-rs <dig> in the human genome, must represent the expression of gpi1_v <dig> .

to distinguish between gpi1_v <dig> and gpi1-rs <dig> expression, we designed pcr primers to specifically detect expression of gpi1-rs <dig> . using this approach, we did not detect a gpi1-rs1-specific product , indicating that pcr products initially detected in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids  are most likely derived from gpi1_v <dig> transcripts.

we detected expression of the gpi <dig> protein in various tissues and germ cells isolated from mouse testis . gpi <dig> has  <dig> amino acids, while gpi1_v <dig> has  <dig> amino acids since it is missing sequence encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig> . gpi1-rs <dig> is also missing sequence encoding exons  <dig> and  <dig> but contains an n-terminal extension and is, therefore,  <dig> amino acids . the predicted molecular weights of gpi <dig>  gpi1_v <dig>  and gpi1-rs <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. we detected a protein band that migrates with an apparent molecular weight of ~ <dig>  in all tissues analyzed. this band is assumed to be gpi <dig> due to its ubiquitous expression pattern. we also identified a larger immunoreactive band that was seen only in isolated spermatogenic cells . this protein is not present in human or mouse sperm and is larger than the predicted molecular weights of gpi1_v <dig> and gpi1-rs <dig>  we also found that glucose phosphate isomerase is soluble in the supernatant fraction following sonication of mouse sperm . since gpi <dig> is not found in insoluble fractions of mouse sperm, it is not tightly bound to the fibrous sheath, the cytoskeletal structure in the sperm flagellum that binds multiple glycolytic enzymes with unique n-terminal extensions  <cit> . although we were unable to distinguish gpi1_v <dig> in our western analysis, we identified an alternative splice variant of gpi <dig> that is transcribed in spermatogenic cells of the mouse testis.

repetitive elements are overrepresented in sequence flanking retroposed sequences
the aldoart <dig> sequence provided evidence for an alternative splice variant  of aldolase a that is also expressed during spermatogenesis  <cit> . in our analyses of other retroposed sequences, we examined flanking sequences for evidence of alternative splicing or additional coding sequence, particularly at the n-terminus. analysis of  <dig> kb sequence both upstream and downstream of all human and mouse retroposed sequences did not identify additional coding sequences. instead, we found a significant  increase in the number of repetitive elements, particularly line and ltr elements, in regions that flank retroposed sequences compared to the regions that flank the parent genes  .

we calculated the percent frequency of both line and ltr elements at each base pair within  <dig> kb upstream and downstream of each retroposed sequences, as compared to intron-containing parent genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. we observed an increase in line and ltr elements along the entire  <dig> kb immediately upstream or downstream of retroposed sequences . because line elements are found preferentially in -rich regions of the genome  <cit> , we expected a low  content in the flanking regions  of retroposed sequences. surprisingly, we found that the  content matched the  content of the entire genome for both species . therefore, these retroposed sequences and flanking repetitive elements are not preferentially located in  rich regions. we dated the repeated elements by comparing their nucleotide divergence from their respective consensus sequences, and then compared these values to the nucleotide divergence of the corresponding retroposed glycolytic sequence from the corresponding parent gene . we find that there is no correlation.

discussion
we found frequent retrotransposition of one member in each gene family encoding the glycolytic enzymes. remarkably, the orthologous gene is retroposed independently in the human and mouse genomes. phylogenetic analyses indicate that the retroposed parent gene is not the most slowly-evolving gene in each gene family  <cit> . in support of this conclusion, phylogenetic trees for five representative glycolytic enzymes are shown in additional file  <dig>  although at least one retrogene, pgk <dig>  is present in all eutherian mammals  <cit> , most of the retroposed sequences identified in this analysis arose following the primate-rodent split. many factors may contribute to preferential retrotransposition of a single orthologous gene in each gene family in both species.

germline expression of the parent gene is required for retrotransposition events that can be transmitted to future generations. retroposed parent genes in the glycolytic pathway are expressed in testicular germ cells, including hk <dig>  gpi <dig>  aldoa, tpi <dig>  gapdh, pgk <dig>  pgam <dig>  eno <dig> and pkm <dig>  <cit> . these studies and microarray analyses of isolated spermatogenic cells http://mrg.genetics.washington.edu/ <cit>  indicate that glycolytic enzyme genes that are retroposed  are expressed during early mitotic  and/or meiotic  stages of spermatogenesis in the mouse. the same microarray studies indicate that several glycolytic enzyme genes that are not retroposed are not expressed during spermatogenesis  or are expressed only during the haploid period . mrna abundance and stability, as well as short length and nucleotide sequence, may contribute to preferential retrotransposition  <cit> ,

along with expression of the parent gene, the machinery that facilitates retrotransposition of mrna transcripts must also be expressed in the same developmental stage/cell type of the germline. orf <dig> and orf <dig>  the line element-encoded proteins that provide rna-binding and enzymatic activities required for retrotransposition, are expressed in testicular germ cells, including preleptotene and zygotene spermatocytes  <cit> . we found an overrepresentation of line and ltr repetitive elements flanking retroposed sequences derived from genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, but no evidence that both events occurred simultaneously. these retroposed sequences and flanking repetitive elements are not found in  rich regions, where line and ltr elements are normally found  <cit> , suggesting a distinct mechanism for the genomic integration of these sequences compared to repetitive elements alone.

our genomic analyses of retroposed sequences identified aldoart <dig> and aldoart <dig>  two newly identified retrogenes in mouse  <cit> , and may provide additional insights regarding the process of retrotransposition and the evolution of expressed retrogenes. we determined that the gene families encoding glycolytic enzymes have single members that are frequently retrotransposed, resulting in the creation of multiple gene copies in the genome. this high frequency suggests that most mammalian species, including those that are phylogenetically close, are likely to differ in the number and function of glycolytic enzymes. some of the retroposed sequences have orfs, due either to very recent retrotransposition events providing very little time for the accumulation of sequence divergence, or to selective pressure exerted on sequences that are expressed. sequences with orfs that are expressed in testicular germ cells may be acted upon by selective pressure in the context of reproductive fitness, and it is known that there is rapid evolution of genes involved in reproduction  <cit> .

it is well known that gene duplication, including retrotransposition, provides the opportunity for the duplicated genes to diverge by mutation and eventually change or acquire new functions. in contrast with other tissues, the evolution of the glycolytic pathway in spermatogenic cells is focused on insuring the production of high levels of atp in the sperm flagellum. there are a surprising number of glycolytic variants in mammalian sperm, and recent studies continue to uncover new enzymes and regulatory features of both glycolytic and other metabolic enzymes. for example, it is now clear that glycolysis and respiration occur in two distinct compartments of the sperm flagellum, adding complexity to the typical regulatory interactions of these metabolic pathways  <cit> . furthermore, at least five glycolytic enzymes are tightly bound to the fibrous sheath, a cytoskeletal structure in the principal piece of the flagellum  <cit> . these include multiple germ cell-specific isozymes with novel n-terminal extensions that are hypothesized to play a role in localizing glycolysis in the principal piece, thereby insuring an adequate supply of atp along the full length of the flagellum. adaptations during the ongoing evolution of glycolysis have involved the rapid emergence of new genes by duplication and retrotransposition, the acquisition of distinct expression patterns in male germ cells, changes in the enzymatic properties, and novel structural features that facilitate compartmentalization of the glycolytic pathway in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified frequent retrotransposition in both the human and mouse genomes of a single orthologous gene in each gene family encoding glycolytic enzymes. integration of retrotransposition events is random. many of these retroposed sequences have orfs and some support the expression of alternative splice variants and n-terminal extensions. these sequences are lineage-specific and many are recent, indicating that similar genomic analyses in other organisms may identify additional genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. several of the retroposed sequences identified in this study have retained orfs despite substantial sequence divergence, suggesting functional importance. glycolysis is essential for sperm motility and fertilization. it is likely that selective pressure in the context of reproductive fitness contributes to the evolution of novel isozymes in this pathway.
