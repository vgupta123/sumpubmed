BACKGROUND
nelumbo nucifera gaertn., also known as sacred lotus, is an aquatic crop of considerable agricultural, ornamental, religious, and medical importance  <cit> . sacred lotus belongs to the family nelumbonaceae , which comprises only two species, n.nucifera and n.lutea  <cit> . analyses of morphological differences and molecular markers have identified three distinct types of cultivar: rhizome lotus, seed lotus, and flower lotus  <cit> . rhizome lotus and seed lotus are the two most popular aquatic vegetable crops in china  <cit>  with estimated areas under cultivation of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ha, respectively, in  <dig> 

lotus breeding began about 30 years ago in china  <cit>  and several elite lotus cultivars have been produced and are now widely cultivated  <cit> . nevertheless, research on lotus still faces many difficulties compared to other crop species as it is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly. firstly, single lotus plants can span three to five square meters and need to be grown in separate cement ponds to prevent misidentification of individuals, which means a high investment in the cultivation facility. secondly, the underground rhizomes of lotus can expand to  <dig> to 50 cm in depth in the soil, which increases the difficulty of rhizome phenotyping. as a result of these complications, the genetic basis of the most important agronomic traits and other phenotypes are not yet understood.

plant breeding using molecular genetic markers is an efficient approach to overcoming such limitations. high-density genetic maps, including quantitative trait locus  mapping and marker-assisted selection, are essential for the efficient use of this approach to plant breeding. yang et al.  <cit>  reported the first genetic maps for n. nucifera and n. lutea based on  <dig> and  <dig> ssr  markers, respectively. these maps were later expanded by zhang et al.  <cit> . currently, the n.nucifera genetic map comprises  <dig> markers and the n. lutea genetic map has  <dig> radseq markers and  <dig> ssr markers on  <dig> linkage groups . these genetic maps are of value for mapping quantitative trait loci  affecting plant size, leaf shape, petal shape and color, and other desirable characters; however, they are less useful for mapping yield-related traits in rhizome and seed lotuses since the parental plants were wild lotus phenotypes that exhibit unfavorable agronomic traits such as thin rhizomes and low seed yield. in addition, the existing genetic map for n. nucifera also lacks sufficient markers to conduct qtl analysis and molecular mapping, while the high-density genetic map for n. lutea has failed to coalesce into eight linkage groups representing the eight lotus chromosomes. as a result, construction of a more saturated map with a higher density of markers is needed to meet the demand for breeding improved lotus cultivars especially for crop varieties.

next-generation sequencing  provides the opportunity for large-scale genome sequencing, and has already been exploited in denovo sequencing of disparate organisms such as panda  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , apple  <cit> , and lotus  <cit> . ming et al. successfully sequenced the genome of the sacred lotus cultivar ‘china antique’  <cit> , while a draft genome of a wild strain of lotus was reported that spanned 792 mb,  <dig>  % of the estimated 929 mb lotus genome. single-nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant and stable form of genetic variation in most genomes. large-scale identification of high quality snps can be achieved through use of restriction site-associated dna sequencing ; this method has the advantages of relatively low cost and speed  <cit> , which are highly beneficial for genetic map construction. radseq is based on sequencing the dna flanking specific restriction enzyme sites rather than the whole genome  <cit> . the use of two restriction enzymes, double digest radseq , improves the efficiency of producing a sequencing library and robustness of the results while minimizing cost  <cit> .

rhizome and seed lotus cultivars display high phenotypic diversity in both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction . in addition, high genetic diversity has been found between the two types of cultivar  <cit> . consequently, a map derived from a cross between a rhizome lotus cultivar and a seed lotus cultivar will substantially facilitate the molecular characterization of phenotypic variation and qtl mapping of important trait loci in both types of lotus cultivar.fig.  <dig> the main phenotypic differences between parent cultivars. a the seed lotus cultivar ‘mantianxing’ used as female parent was planted in field in fast-growing stage; b the rhizome cultivar ‘juwuba’ used as male parent was planted in field in fast-growing stage; c, d, e and f is the flower, fruit, seed and rhizome of ‘mantianxing’, respectively; g, h, i and j is the flower, fruit, seed and rhizome of juwuba, respectively



in this study, a high-density genetic map was constructed using ddradseq  <cit>  of genomic dna from 96 f <dig> progeny derived from a cross between the rhizome lotus cultivar n. nucifera cv. ‘juwuba’ and the seed lotus cultivar n. nucifera cv. ‘mantianxing’. overall,  <dig>  % of the assembled genome of the wild asian lotus  <cit>  was anchored. this is the first report of a genetic map based on two types of lotus cultivar and will be of value for accelerating the characterization of agronomically important traits.

RESULTS
phenotypic differences between parental cultivars
although the two cultivars used here, ‘juwuba’ and ‘mantianxing’, belong to the same species, they exhibit distinct phenotypic differences. ‘juwuba’ has vigorous vegetative growth, an enlarged rhizome, and a small number of white flowers; by contrast, ‘mantianxing’ exhibits vigorous sexual reproduction with a long flowering time and large numbers of red flowers with extra carpels, but its rhizome is smaller . we have recorded the main characters of both parents for five years . the rhizome weight was  <dig>  fold greater in ‘juwuba’ than ‘mantianxing’ and the width of the section between the third and fourth knots of the main stem was  <dig>  fold greater in ‘juwuba’. the numbers of flowers and carpels in ‘mantianxing’ were  <dig> and  <dig>  fold higher, respectively, than ‘juwuba’. from the wide phenotypic differences in the parents, we anticipated that broad variation would be present in the f <dig> generation.

restriction enzyme selection for dna sequencing library construction
the assembly sequence of the wild lotus  <cit>  was in silico digested with five enzyme combinations ecori/sbfi, ecori/mspi, ecori/sphi, sphi/mluci, and nlaiii/mluci. the distribution of restriction fragments on the genome was predicted. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the mspi/ecori combination was predicted to produce  <dig>  restriction fragments of  <dig> to 500 bp; this was the maximum predicted fragment number of the five enzyme combinations, and was considered sufficient to construct a high-density genetic map. therefore, we double digested the genomic dna of parents and progeny with mspi and ecori to construct a sequencing library.

dna sequencing
the ddradseq library of all samples was analyzed by massively parallel solexa sequencing, which generated a total of ~ <dig>  gb raw data containing  <dig> , <dig>  pair-end reads of ~100 bp . after removing the low-quality reads , approximately  <dig>  gb clean reads were sorted based on identified barcodes. most of the samples had more than  <dig> million reads . sample z <dig>  which only had  <dig>  million reads, was omitted from the following analysis.table  <dig> summary of rad sequencing for snp calling from the rhizome lotus juwuba and the seed lotus mantianxing  and their f <dig> progenies

the sorted reads were aligned to the wild strain lotus genome assembly   <cit>  using the burrows-wheeler aligner  program   <cit> . the  <dig> , <dig> mapped reads from the male parent, juwuba, and the  <dig> , <dig> reads from the female parent, mantianxing, covered  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the lotus genome, respectively. for f <dig> individuals, an average of  <dig> , <dig> reads was mapped to the reference genome  <cit>  with mean coverage of  <dig>  % of the lotus genome. the read depth was  <dig> × for the female parent,  <dig> × for the male parent, and  <dig> × for the f <dig> progeny . detailed read information for the parents and the f <dig> individuals is shown in additional file  <dig>  the raw data of the f <dig> individuals contained many highly redundant reads, which may have resulted from chloroplasts in the leaf tissues that were used for dna extraction. this contaminating dna reduced the mapping rate for f <dig> individuals.

snp calling and genotyping
the mapped reads of parents and f <dig> individuals were then aligned to the reference genome  <cit>  for snp calling. only uniquely mapped reads with one or two mismatches were retained. snp calling was carried out using the genome analysis toolkit program   <cit>  and filtered using a series of stringent selection criteria . at last,  <dig>  valid snp markers were obtained and the genotyping loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with high integrity. the snp markers integrity was  <dig>  % for ‘mantianxing’,  <dig>  % for ‘juwuba’, and  <dig>  % for the f <dig> population .

genetic map construction
the  <dig>  snp markers segregating in the f <dig> population were used to construct a genetic linkage map using joinmap <dig>  software  <cit> . at a lod threshold of  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  snp markers were clustered into  <dig> lgs, consistent with the haploid chromosome number of lotus . the types of the grouped snp markers in the parents and the f <dig> population are shown in additional file  <dig>  the snp markers were next scanned in 100 kb windows on the mapped scaffolds of the reference genome, and co-segregating snp markers were sorted into bin markers.

in total,  <dig> bin markers were identified after scanning for co-segregation and were used to construct a genetic linkage map with  <dig> lgs spanning  <dig>  cm and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm . detailed information on the snps and the bin markers on the linkage map are shown in additional file  <dig>  lg sizes varied widely: the largest group, lg <dig>  contained  <dig> bin markers spanning  <dig>  cm, while the shortest, lg <dig>  only included  <dig> markers over  <dig>  cm. the average marker interval of the eight lgs ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  cm  .

segregation-distorted markers
distorted segregation  was found for  <dig> of the mapped bin markers, i.e.,  <dig>  % of the total . the majority of the markers showing segregation distortion were distributed as clusters; in line with previous studies, we defined clusters of more than three adjacent loci showing significant segregation distortion as segregation distortion regions   <cit> . thirteen sdrs distributed across seven linkage groups were identified , with the largest number  on lg <dig> . these segregation distortion markers may result from gametic or zygotic selection  <cit> , but their presence does not have a large effect on further use of the map for qtl mapping . therefore, the segregation distortion markers were retained here to increase the coverage of the linkage groups.fig.  <dig> distribution of normal  and segregation distorted bin markers  on  <dig> linkage groups. the x-axis indicates genetic distance  and the y-axis represents linkage group number



genome scaffolds anchoring of the wild strain of sacred lotus
in our previous work, we partially sequenced the genome of the wild asian lotus and generated a construct of 792 mb that accounted for  <dig> to 95 % of the estimated complete lotus genome  <cit> . here, we anchored  <dig> scaffolds to eight lotus pseudochromosomes with a total length of 565 mb, representing  <dig>  % of the lotus assembly ; the positions of the scaffolds on the eight pseudochromosomes are detailed in additional file  <dig>  of these anchored scaffolds,  <dig>  could be oriented. the number of anchored scaffolds ranged from  <dig> for lg <dig> to  <dig> for lg1; the physical sizes of the eight pseudochromosomes ranged from  <dig>  mb  to  <dig>  mb . the relationship between genetic distance  and physical size  varied widely, from  <dig>  cm/mb on lg <dig> to  <dig>  cm/mb on lg <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  cm/mb.table  <dig> the scaffold number, total length, physical size, marker density and effective length of eight pseudochromosomes

comparative genomics
next, we compared our newly generated genetic map with the two published ssr-based maps  <cit> . we analyzed  <dig> ssr markers from the n. lutea cultivar ‘al1’ and  <dig> ssr markers from the n.nucifera cultivar ‘china antique’. results showed that  <dig> and  <dig> markers respectively were shared with the wild lotus genome  <cit> , and  <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively, could be mapped to the anchored scaffolds of our new genetic map. the correspondence between genetic maps is shown in table  <dig>  most, if not all, markers on lg1-m and lg7-m  from n.lutea were assigned to lg <dig> in our genetic map . in agreement with zhang et al., who integrated lg4-m and lg1-m into lg <dig> of the radseq marker-based group  <cit> , we infer from our results that lg1-m, lg4-m, and lg7-m all belong to lg <dig> in our map. the n. lutea markers on lg2-m predominantly fell into lg <dig>  lg3-m into lg <dig>  lg5-m into lg <dig>  lg6-m into lg <dig>  lg8-m into lg <dig>  lg9-m into lg <dig>  and lg10-m into lg <dig> of our genetic map.table  <dig> the correspondence between our genetic map and two published ssr-based maps  <cit>  for scoring ssr markers

we also compared our genetic map with a high density american lotus map  <cit> . we found that most ssr markers on lg <dig> from the high density american lotus map fell into lg <dig> in our map. considering that the lg1s from the two genetic maps analyzed above belong to the same chromosome, we can further integrate lg <dig> and lg <dig> from the american lotus into one linkage group.

discussion
molecular genetic markers provide a powerful tool for associating heritable traits with underlying genetic variation. however, due to technical limitations, most of the initial large-scale genetic marker development and high density genetic map construction was carried out in model species, such as arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . in recent years, the development of ngs technology, especially ddradseq, has provided a powerful and low-cost tool for the large-scale discovery of snp markers in any plant species  <cit> . this approach has been successfully applied to the construction of high-density genetic maps  <cit> , assembly of genome scaffolds , and mapping of qtls  <cit> .

in the present study, we successfully constructed a high-density genetic map from two n.nucifera cultivars using the ddradseq method. we identified  <dig> bin markers distributed across  <dig> lgs; the number of lgs exactly matched the number of chromosomes in nelumbo species . the average interval between genetic bin markers in this study is  <dig>  cm. this is comparable with or better than the marker density of genetic maps constructed for other crops using the same radseq protocol, e.g.,sesame, <dig>  markers and  <dig>  cm interval  <cit> , soybean,  <dig>  markers and  <dig>  cm interval  <cit> , and peanut,  <dig>  markers and  <dig>  cm interval  <cit> . in addition, our new genetic map provides a marked improvement in marker density and population size compared to the two previously published genetic maps for n.nucifera and n.lutea  <cit> , which were based on the same f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals. the published map for n. nucifera contains  <dig> markers, and that of n. lutea has  <dig>  radseq markers and  <dig> ssr markers on  <dig> lgs. the genetic map produced in the current study is therefore a more saturated map and has high resolution for qtl mapping.

using the  <dig>  ddrad markers in the present high density genetic map,  <dig> genome scaffolds of the wild strain n. nucifera assembly  were successfully anchored to eight pseudochromosomes with a total length of 566 mb . the previously published scaffold assembly for lotus consists of nine megascaffolds indicating that a gap was present within a linkage group of one chromosome. the additional anchoring in this study resulted in a match between the number of linkage groups and the haploid number of chromosomes; moreover, the relative sizes of the linkage groups are similar to those of the chromosomes  <cit> . therefore, our new genetic map, along with the improved genome assembly, resolution, and integrity, will play an important role in further marker assisted selection and qtl mapping of important traits for breeding new varieties of lotus.

segregation distorting is a common phenomenon in most genetically segregating populations  and is thought to be an important driving force in evolution through increasing genomic heterozygosity. we also observed a low rate of segregation distortion affecting some markers in our genetic map. the rate of such markers was less than one-third that reported for the ssr based american map  <cit> . two factors may account for this difference. firstly, our map used an f <dig> population whereas the american map was based on an f <dig> population. in general, segregation marker skewing is lower in f <dig> populations than in recombinant inbred lines, backcross populations, and f <dig> populations  <cit> . secondly, the two nelumbo species used here as parents show less genetic divergence than is present between the american lotus and the asian lotus. mapping based on wide crosses carries the risk of distorted segregation and altered linkages due to gametic selection and/or chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . we further found that most of the aberrant segregation markers tended to be located in close proximity and  <dig> putative sdrs were detected; this indicated that segregation distortion was not induced by technical problems but most likely arose through biological factors such as selection for gametophytes and sporophytes.

comparison of genetic maps for n.nucifera and n. lutea showed good collinearity in all the linkage groups . markers on lg1-m and lg7-m of n. lutea generally appeared in the same order as those from lg <dig> of n.nucifera, although a few adjacent markers showed a reversal in their order. the discrepancies in the order of adjacent markers might be due to the relatively small populations used for linkage map construction ; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of genetic variation between the two species. the long genetic length and high density of markers in our genetic map provided the opportunity to fill gaps in previous maps of n.lutea. we successfully integrated lg1-m, lg4-m, and lg7-m into a single linkage group . moreover, we integrated lg <dig> and lg <dig> from the radseq map  <cit>  into a single linkage group, which further saturated the high density map for american lotus.

although 96 f <dig> progeny were used to construct the genetic map and  <dig> snp markers  were obtained, only  <dig> bin markers were identified due to co-segregation in the f <dig> population. the small genetic pool resulted in lower recombination in the f <dig> individuals and reduced the resolution of the genetic map  <cit> . currently, we are using asexual reproduction of f <dig> progeny to increase the number of f <dig> progeny to over  <dig>  using this expanded resource, we will soon obtain more snp markers to further saturate our genetic map. as the f <dig> population can be preserved permanently through asexual reproduction, this will facilitate the characterization of important traits in the laboratory and field.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we use cutting-edge genomic techniques to create genetic map of n. nucifera that greatly improves on the quality of previous genetic maps. n. nucifera is valued as a food crop in addition to its ornamental and cultural importance, yet no genetic map that we are aware of focuses on agricultural cultivars. we have filled that gap. in addition, because of the higher density and quality of information in this genetic map, we are able to anchor the “scaffold” portions of the recorded n. nucifera genome assembly that are not based on continuous, contiguous sequences. with a better genome assembly, the genotypic basis of valuable traits can be identified, and sacred lotus breeding can be practiced more efficiently.
