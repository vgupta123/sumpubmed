BACKGROUND
lactococcus lactis is the model lactic acid bacterium extensively used in the manufacture of fermented foods of animal origin. a goal for the food industry has always been to improve l. lactis strains and to stabilize important traits of this bacterium. today, genetic engineering is used extensively for manipulating l. lactis. important contributions to the evolution of genetic technology of this organism include the development of transformation techniques and the construction of powerful plasmids for gene cloning and for general mutagenesis  <cit> . in the past years, electroporation has become the widest used method for introducing dna in l. lactis cells. transformation by electroporation involves the application of a brief, high voltage electrical pulse to a suspension of cells and dna. although the molecular mechanism of electrotransformation is not completely understood, the electrical pulse is though to result in a rearrangement of the components of the cell wall and membrane to generate transient pores through which the dna can pass into the cell  <cit> .

harlander  <cit>  was the first to employ electroporation in l. lactis. later, mcintyre and harlander  <cit>  improved electroporation efficiency of intact l. lactis cells by adjusting a number of parameters like the growth phase and final concentration of cells, the growth medium, the concentration of plasmid dna and the amplitude and duration of the pulse. since then, numerous papers describing the transformation of lactic acid bacteria have been published  <cit> . the efficiency of electrotransformation is strongly correlated to the level of electropermeabilization  <cit> . as the physical barrier of the cell wall has to be weakened enough in order that an adequate amount of dna will enter the cell, pretreatment with chemicals that increase cell wall permeability, and subsequently improve the transformation rate, has often been proposed. pretreatment with lysozyme has been proposed by powel et al.  <cit> , threonine, by van der lelie et al.  <cit>  and dornan and collins  <cit>  and glycine, by holo and nes  <cit>  and le bourgeois et al.  <cit> . the effect of cell wall weakening agents, however, is not universal as they were found to be either highly strain-specific  <cit>  or completely ineffective with some microorganisms  <cit> .

chemical treatment prior to electroporation tends to be common practice today with bacteria and fungi and various chemicals are proposed in electrotransformation protocols, while their mechanism of action is not always known. cacl <dig> for example, is used successfully with escherichia coli  <cit>  and what makes the treatment successful is still unknown. similarly, thiol compounds and lithium acetate are used successfully with yeasts while the way they act and increase transformation efficiencies remains unknown  <cit> .

in the present work, the transformation efficiency of l. lactis spp.lactis lm <dig> and l. lactis spp.lactis atcc  <dig> cells, treated with various combinations of liac and dtt before electroporation was examined. according to literature information, pretreatment with these chemicals has never been applied before with l. lactis or other bacteria. a tremendous improvement of transformation efficiency was observed in cells of both tested strains treated with both liac and ddt. the effect of cell density on transformation efficiency of pretreated cells was also studied.

RESULTS
mcintyre and harlander  <cit>  studied the influence of the growth phase of cells and cell density on transformation efficiency of l. lactis lm <dig>  transformation efficiencies were significantly higher  using late stationary phase cells  at high cell concentrations  when subjected to high voltage electric pulses. however, improved transformation efficiencies of approximately  <dig> transformants/μg dna with the same system of host/vector were achieved by dornan and collins  <cit>  by altering the conditions under which the bacteria were grown prior to electroporation, e.g. by incorporating threonine in the medium, while cells of the early-log phase were used. le bourgeois et al.  <cit>  reported transformation efficiencies of 1– <dig> ×  <dig> transformants/μg of dna for l. lactis spp.cremoris mg <dig> using pil <dig> as plasmid dna, and a medium containing glycine  and  <dig>  m sucrose, as osmotic stabilizer.

in the present study, the conditions applied by dornan and collins  <cit>  were mostly adopted and transformation efficiencies were determined for cells without and following pretreatment with various combinations of liac and dtt with l. lactis lm <dig> and l. lactis atcc  <dig> and plasmid ptrkh <dig>  a  <dig>  kb plasmid which is a shuttle vector with a wide host range of gram-positive bacterial strains including l. lactis  <cit> . liac is used widely in yeast transformation  <cit> , while pretreatment with thiol compounds has also been applied  <cit> . thomson et al.  <cit>  pretreated saccharomyces cerevisiae with liac and dtt and reported enhanced transformation efficiency. wu and lechworth  <cit>  also used a combination of liac and dtt and achieved high efficiency transformation of pichia pastoris, otherwise known for its lower transformation efficiencies compared to other yeasts. while the mechanism for these effects is unclear, treatment of s. cerevisiae with a combination of liac and a reducing agent has been shown to modify cell wall porosity and increase their permeability. to the best of our knowledge, the successfully applied to various yeasts treatments with liac and dtt, have never been tested before with bacteria.

transformation efficiencies achieved with various treatments for the electroporation of plasmid ptrkh <dig> into l. lactis lm <dig> and l. lactis atcc  <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  plasmid analysis of  <dig> putative transformants from each strain, selected randomly from each trial revealed the presence of the plasmid ptrkh <dig> . untransformed cells failed to grow in antibiotic containing medium. the results presented in table  <dig> show a tremendous increase in transformation efficiency in cells pretreated with both liac and dtt: in the case of l. lactis lm <dig> for example,  <dig> ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> transformants/μg dna  with pretreated cells versus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> transformants/μg dna in the case of cells directly electroporated or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> transformants/μg when cells were treated with liac alone. treatment with dtt alone resulted in a significant improvement of transformation efficiency . results of the same trend were obtained with l. lactis atcc  <dig>  although, as shown in table  <dig>  this strain shows significantly lower electrotransformation efficiency compared to l. lactis lm <dig>  unlike with l. lactis lm <dig>  there are no reports in the literature to provide information on transformation efficiency of l. lactis atcc  <dig>  it is well known however, that transformation efficiencies could vary widely between strains of the same species  <cit> . obviously, the combination of both chemicals, which may act through different mechanisms, seem to multiply the effects. no difference was found in the survival rate of pretreated cells of both strains after electroporation. under the particular tested conditions, the survival rate ranged between 13–15% in the range of  <dig> – <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml.

to study the effect of cell density on transformation efficiency, cells of l. lactis lm <dig> were collected, treated with liac and ddt, washed and diluted to various concentrations . ptrkh <dig> was transformed, as described in the methods section, into each cell concentration, and the transformed colonies were counted. transformation efficiency varied directly with cell density  . the increase in transformation efficiency with higher cell densities appeared to be linear, suggesting that transformation was more efficient at increased cell densities and that high cell densities were critical to obtaining high transformation efficiencies in l. lactis. previously, mcintyre and harlander  <cit>  made a similar observation for cell concentration and l. lactis transformation efficiency. however, the highest yield of transformants/μg dna reported was in the order of  <dig>  transformants/μg dna corresponding to cell densities of  <dig> cfu/ml, which is extremely low compared to present results. a linear relationship between cell density and transformation efficiency has also been reported by wu and letchworth  <cit>  with the yeast p. pastoris. an immediate explanation for this phenomenon is difficult since fewer dna molecules were avalaible for each cell at high density. the possibility that cells electroporated at low densities failed to survive the procedure seems impossible since no difference was found in survival rates as mentioned above.

following treatment with liac and ddt and electrotransformation, vector stability was examined in transformants of both tested strains containing ptrkh <dig>  transformants were cultivated for  <dig> generations in medium without erythromycin and subsequently plated on solidified medium with and without erythromycin. the vector was stably maintained since a loss of ≤ 4% after  <dig> generations without selection was observed. structural stability of the plasmid was also examined by cultivation in selective medium for  <dig> generations, plating on solid medium and analysis of plasmid dna from a number of colonies. sequencing revealed no deletions indicating that ptrkh <dig> was also structurally stably maintained.

CONCLUSIONS
treatment of l. lactis spp. lactis lm <dig> and l. lactis spp. lactis atcc  <dig> cells with liac and ddt prior to electrotransformation with plasmid ptrkh <dig>  resulted in a tremendous improvement in transformation efficiency without affecting their survival rate. the developed methodology applied to high cell density suspensions  allows the production of large numbers of transformants. the described host-vector systems are reproducible and highly efficient.
