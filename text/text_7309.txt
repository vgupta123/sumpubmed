BACKGROUND
the gli-kruppel-type transcription factor yin yang  <dig>  is a ubiquitously expressed, multifunctional protein that can function as an activator, repressor, or initiator binding protein depending on its promoter context, chromatin structure, and interacting proteins  <cit> . yy <dig> is also known to undergo various post-translational modifications, causing different outcomes on the functions of yy <dig>  yy <dig> interacts directly or indirectly with many key proteins including the components of 1) rna polymerase ii transcription machineries, such as rna polymerase ii, tfiib, tbp and tafii <dig>  2) transcription factors, such as sp <dig>  c-myc, c-myb and creb, and 3) histone-modifying complexes, such as p <dig>  cbp, hats, hdacs, prmt <dig>  and phorc and ino <dig>  <cit> .

yy <dig> is involved in the transcriptional control of a large number of mammalian genes, approximately 10% of the total mammalian gene set  <cit> . consequently, yy <dig> plays important roles in a number of biological processes, including cell cycle control, embryogenesis, viral infection, programmed cell death, oncogenesis, polycomb group  function and b-cell development  <cit> . since it is a general transcription factor involved in so many pathways, the expression levels of yy <dig> must be tightly monitored for the survival of cells and organisms  <cit> . accordingly, abnormal yy <dig> protein levels have been shown to cause defects in cell proliferation and differentiation, neural development, and the repression mediated by the pcg complex. also, there are several types of the yy1-related diseases, such as viral infection and cancers, which are also linked to abnormal yy <dig> protein levels  <cit> . these observations clearly predict the presence of some regulatory mechanism that are responsible for maintaining the appropriate transcriptional levels of yy <dig>  nevertheless, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the yy <dig> gene is largely unknown so far except for a few earlier observations on the promoter regions of the human and mouse yy <dig> gene  <cit> .

in the current study, we have identified a cluster of multiple yy <dig> binding sites located in the first intron of the yy <dig> gene. we characterized this cluster of yy <dig> binding sites in terms of evolutionary conservation and transcriptional activity. we also tested the possibility that yy <dig> may be regulated through its own binding sites. for this test, we have established and used a tet-on inducible system, in which we can control the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein. our results demonstrated that changes in the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein affect the transcriptional levels of its own locus, yy <dig>  most likely through its own binding sites. this autoregulation is regarded as a homeostatic response of the yy <dig> locus to maintain the constant cellular levels of yy <dig> protein.

RESULTS
identification of multiple yy <dig> binding sites in the 1st intron of yy1
we have identified an evolutionarily conserved region in the 1st intron of yy <dig> via the ecr  browser, a tool for visualizing sequence comparison of multiple vertebrate genomes  <cit> . as shown in figure 1a, the genomic sequence of the 1st exon and intron region of human yy <dig> was successfully aligned with those from eight different species including tetraodon, zebrafish, frog, opossum, cow, mouse, dog, and rhesus macaque. as expected, the first exon  showed high levels of sequence conservation. interestingly, however, a similar level of conservation was also detected in the beginning of the 1st intron region . we further analyzed this small region,  <dig> bp in length, in more detail. as shown in figure 1b, we manually aligned genomic sequences derived from  <dig> different vertebrates: one each from sea squirt, purple sea urchin and amphioxus, two from each of two fish, one from frog, and five from mammals. multiple sequence alignment using clustralw revealed  <dig> to 48% sequence identity between the urochordates,  <dig> to 82% sequence identity between the two fish,  <dig> to 98% sequence identity between the five mammals. detailed inspection revealed that this small region is mainly filled with multiple yy <dig> binding sites. most vertebrates contain  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites within this  <dig> bp region except for sea squirt  and amphioxus . neither the sequence nor the length of the spacer regions between individual yy <dig> binding sites are conserved, which becomes more apparent in the urochordates' yy <dig> binding regions. the sequences of most of the yy <dig> binding sites are identical to the consensus sequences of the known yy <dig> binding motif, which display very high levels of affinity to yy <dig> protein  <cit> . however, one binding site, the 3rd one of all the vertebrates except urochordates, shows a slight sequence variation from the known consensus , but still conserved among the vertebrates. the orientation of the individual yy <dig> binding sites is also conserved: the first two yy <dig> binding sites are localized in one direction, while the remaining three sites are in the other direction. the opposite orientation of the two outside yy <dig> binding sites is particularly well conserved throughout all the vertebrates. we have also examined the 1st intron of pho, a homolog of yy <dig> in drosophila  <cit> , but we did not find a similar genomic region with multiple pho-binding sites. this indicates that this cluster of yy <dig> binding sites is unique to vertebrates. chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay was performed to confirm the in vivo binding of yy <dig> to its own binding sites located in the 1st intron. homogenized mouse brain tissues were cross-linked with formaldehyde and immuno-precipitated with anti-yy <dig> polyclonal antibodies . as expected, the multiple yy <dig> binding sites showed consistent enrichment levels of the immuno-precipitated dna with this chip experiment, whereas the two other control regions, upstream and downstream, did not show any detectible levels of the dna enrichment. this confirms in vivo binding of yy <dig> to its own multiple binding sites in the 1st intron. in sum, the 1st intron of the yy <dig> gene locus of all vertebrates contains a cluster of its own dna-binding sites.

yy <dig> binding sites as a transcriptional activator for yy <dig> transcription
we performed promoter assays to determine potential roles of this cluster of yy <dig> binding sites in yy <dig> transcription. for this experiment, we first tried to clone and manipulate the 1-kb genomic region surrounding the 1st exon of the mouse yy <dig>  but we could not amplify and stably maintain this fragment in bacterial clones mainly due to the unusually high gc composition of this region, around 80%. therefore, we used the homologous region derived from zebrafish. according to a series of initial pretests , the promoter region of the zebrafish yy <dig> has reasonably high levels of promoter activity in several mouse cell lines, confirming the feasibility of the planned experiments as well as the evolutionary conservation of the promoter activity associated with this genomic region.

we have generated a series of  <dig> different constructs by modifying the  <dig> -kb endogenous promoter region of the zebrafish yy <dig>  the  <dig> -kb region, covering the 1st exon and the multiple yy <dig> binding sites, was first subcloned into a promoterless reporter system, ires-β-geo . each of these constructs differs from the others in binding affinity, orientation and numbers of intact yy <dig> binding sites. this series of promoter assays excluded one particular yy <dig> binding site, the third, that imperfectly matches the yy <dig> consensus sequence . this difference is known to have much weaker binding affinity to yy <dig> protein  <cit> . to lower the dna-binding affinity to the protein, the sequences of the  <dig> remaining yy <dig> binding sites were mutated from gccatntt to aaccatntt . the orientation of yy <dig> binding sites was also reversed in an opposite direction . we also completely abrogated the binding potential of individual yy <dig> binding sites through mutating the three critical bases within the core motif of yy <dig> from gccatntt to attatntt . these constructs were individually transfected into two different cell lines, neuro2a and nih3t <dig>  along with an internal control luciferase vector  to normalize the β-gal activity.

as shown in figure 2a and 2b, the normalized transcriptional activity of each construct was compared to the activity of the control construct containing the original unchanged  <dig> -kb genomic region of the zebrafish yy <dig>  the promoter activities of all the mutant constructs showed a dramatic decrease compared to that of the control construct. the original activity was completely abolished by any change affecting the binding affinity or orientation of the intact yy <dig> binding sites . this is also true for the second series of mutant constructs containing the different numbers of intact yy <dig> binding sites. regardless how many and which positions of yy <dig> binding sites remain, a single change affecting any of the yy <dig> binding sites completely abolished the transcriptional activity of the yy <dig> promoter . this indicates that all these yy <dig> binding sites are absolutely required for the transcriptional activity of the yy <dig> promoter. a similar pattern was also consistently observed in both neuro2a and nih3t <dig> cells. in sum, the yy <dig> binding sites function as a transcriptional activator for the yy <dig> promoter, and this role apparently requires the absolutely intact sequence structure of all the yy <dig> binding sites.

homeostatic control of the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein
the identification of the yy <dig> binding sites within the yy <dig> locus hinted at one intriguing possibility: yy <dig> may control its own transcription rate through its own binding sites. to test this possibility, we first set up an in vitro system in which we can control the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein. briefly, human yy <dig> was added into the mouse cell line neuro2a, and used as an exogenous gene, which allows for easy distinction between the exogenous and endogenous yy <dig>  a tet-on inducible system was employed to control the expression of the human yy <dig>  we have successfully established several stable cell lines that can induce transcription of the human yy <dig> by the administration of an inducer, doxycycline   <cit> . more detailed information is described in methods.

with the three selected stable cell lines, we first performed time-course experiments . all three cells showed increased levels, about  <dig> fold, of yy <dig> protein at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after the dox administration as shown on western blot results. with the same set of cells, we further confirmed this induction at the transcription level by performing rt-pcr, in which we can differentiate the induced human yy <dig> from the endogenous mouse yy <dig> . as expected, we observed a dramatic increase in the transcriptional level of human yy <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after the dox administration. although we observed low levels of the human yy <dig> prior to the dox induction, this is believed to have been caused by genomic dna contamination in the rna samples. interestingly, the transcriptional levels of the endogenous yy <dig> progressively decreased during the induction. another independent measure using qrt-pcr further revealed that the transcriptional levels were reduced to 70% at  <dig> hours and to 50% levels at  <dig> hours, respectively. according to our survey on the transcription levels of other genes , the observed down-regulation was specific to the yy <dig> locus . this indicates that the overall increased levels of yy <dig> protein, through the induction of the exogenous yy <dig>  somehow resulted in reduction in the transcriptional levels of the endogenous yy <dig>  this initial observation was further validated through the following scheme. we first increased the overall levels of yy <dig> protein through the induction of the human yy <dig>  and later reversed the increased levels back to the normal levels of yy <dig> protein by withdrawing the inducer, dox, from culture media. as predicted, this cycle of addition and withdrawal of the dox treatment caused a concurrent rise and fall in the overall levels of yy <dig> protein. the levels of endogenous yy <dig> transcription changed in a manner inverse to the induced yy <dig> protein: decreasing with yy <dig> induction and increasing with removal of yy <dig> induction as shown in the results of qrt-pcr . this inverse pattern is thought to be a counter-balancing response from the endogenous yy <dig> locus to maintain constant cellular levels of yy <dig> protein. in sum, these results confirm that the overall cellular levels of yy <dig> protein can affect the transcription levels of the yy <dig> locus.

yy <dig> is autoregulated through its own binding sites
the above results clearly demonstrated that the endogenous locus of yy <dig> has an unknown feedback regulatory mechanism that maintains homeostasis of the yy <dig> protein levels. we next tested if this observed regulation is indeed mediated through its own dna-binding sites as part of the hypothesized autoregulation. for this test, we analyzed transcriptional responses from the yy <dig> promoter against a background of fluctuating cellular levels of yy <dig> protein. we first set up the two different cellular levels of yy <dig> protein with the following scheme . the cells to be transfected were first incubated in the absence  and presence  of dox prior to transfection experiments. during the transfection, dox was added  and removed  to create higher and lower levels of yy <dig> protein relative to the control cell, respectively. then, the actual transfection into these cells used each of the following two reporters, intact and all-mut constructs, containing the promoter region of the zebrafish yy <dig> with the intact and mutated yy <dig> binding sites, respectively . these individual transfections were also normalized by including the control luciferase vector . in the first condition , the promoter activity was measured while the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein were being increased by the dox induction. as shown in figure 4a, the intact construct  showed a  <dig> -fold decrease in the promoter activity when the cells started producing more yy <dig> protein. we also observed a similar down-regulation from the endogenous locus in response to increased levels of yy <dig> protein . this response, however, was not detected in the all-mut construct , confirming that the observed response was mediated through the yy <dig> binding sites. in the second condition , the promoter activity was measured while the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein were decreased by the dox withdrawal. the intact construct showed in a  <dig> -fold increase in the promoter activity when the cells started producing less yy <dig> protein. this is also reminiscent of an observed up-regulation from the endogenous locus of yy <dig> in response to the decreased levels of yy <dig> protein. collectively, the zebrafish yy <dig> promoter and the endogenous locus of yy <dig> responded very similarly to fluctuating levels of yy <dig> protein. these similar responses agree very well with the initial prediction that the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites most likely mediates the hypothesized autoregulation mechanism for the endogenous locus of yy <dig> 

discussion
the current study reports the three unique features associated with the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites that is localized in the 1st intron of the vertebrate yy <dig> locus. first, this cluster of yy <dig> binding sites are well conserved throughout all the vertebrates including urochordates, suggesting that this small region has been functionally selected in the past  <dig> to  <dig> million years . this region is probably one of the oldest cis-regulatory regions in the vertebrate genomes. however, similar regions are not found in the pho locus, the yy <dig> homolog in flying insects, suggesting the formation of this region after the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates. this sudden formation of this region in the vertebrates' yy <dig> locus may be linked to the different expression profiles of this gene between these two groups of animals. in insects, the homeotic genes including pho are transiently expressed by segmentation genes during early embryonic development, and their later expressions are controlled by two groups of genes, the trithorax group  and the polycomb group   <cit> . therefore, the expression pattern of pho may be restricted and focused in a developmental stage-specific manner. in contrast, yy <dig> is expressed ubiquitously, spatially and temporarily  <cit> . the ubiquitous expression may have allowed yy <dig> to be involved in a greater number of genes and pathways in the vertebrates than in the invertebrates. consequently, the involvement in a large number of genes most likely has necessitated more sophisticated regulation mechanism for the maintenance of appropriate cellular levels of yy <dig>  taken together, the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites most likely has coevolved with the ubiquitous expression pattern of yy <dig> 

the second unusual feature is that this conserved cis-regulatory region has the dna-binding sites for its own protein product, yy <dig>  this immediately suggests a potential autoregulation mechanism for this locus. according to our cell line studies, the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein indeed affected the transcriptional levels of its own gene locus , and this control also appeared to be mediated through the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites . besides being part of this predicted autoregulation, the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites is also regarded as a transcriptional activator  or repressor . any mutations in the yy <dig> binding sites caused a dramatic decrease in the transcriptional activity of the yy <dig> promoter, indicating that yy <dig> is required for the transcription of its own locus. on the other hand, the same cluster of yy <dig> binding sites functions as a repressor in the presence of excessive cellular levels of yy <dig> protein. according to surveys on transcriptional regulatory networks  <cit> , many e coli proteins, especially repressors, are also subject to similar autoregulation. furthermore, the observed autoregulation is similarly 'negative' autoregulation: these repressors start repressing their own loci once their protein levels reach at their threshold levels. despite these similarities, however, it is important to note that this cluster of yy <dig> binding sites has dual roles, repressor and activator. interestingly, these roles have been detected at different cellular conditions: an activator role during the promoter assays with a normal level of yy <dig> protein  while a repressor role during yy <dig> induction with higher levels of yy <dig> protein . this suggests that the available cellular levels of yy <dig> protein may be a factor deciding which of the two roles to be exerted for a given condition.

then, the next question is how this cluster of yy <dig> binding sites knows different cellular conditions and selects a role between an activator and repressor function. this question may be related to the third feature of this cluster of yy <dig> binding sites: multiplicity. one plausible scenario would be that the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites could function as a sensor recognizing the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein. in the case of higher-than-normal yy <dig> levels, all of the yy <dig> binding sites would be filled with the yy <dig> protein, subsequently block the traverse of this region by pol ii polymerase, and thus function as a repressor. in the case of lower-than-normal yy <dig> levels, on the other hand, only one or two yy <dig> binding sites would be filled, subsequently stimulating transcription by pol ii, and thus act as an activator. it will be very interesting to test this possibility in the near future, but the multiplicity and evolutionary conservation associated with the yy <dig> binding sites are very unusual, and clearly suggest some unknown functional roles in this regulatory region.

despite a large number of genes that are controlled by yy <dig>  there have not been a lot of studies on the transcriptional control of yy <dig> itself. although the current study has mainly focused on the predicted autoregulation mechanism that might be mediated through the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites, we believe that this is not the only regulatory mechanism responsible for the yy <dig> transcription. also, we cannot rule out the possibility that the identified cluster of yy <dig> binding sites might be designed for some other functions for the yy <dig> locus, such as a targeting site for epigenetic modification or a promoter for some unknown transcripts. in a similar line, it is important to emphasize the fact that the unusually high levels of yy <dig> protein are often observed in normal and cancer cells  <cit> . the up-regulated yy <dig> levels in normal cells may be an outcome of an independent regulatory program that has been preset in a given cell. on the other hand, the unusually high levels of yy <dig> protein observed in cancer cells might be an outcome of mis-regulated yy <dig> transcription. one intriguing possibility would be that some epigenetic changes, such as dna methylation or histone modification, and subsequent malfunction of the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites might be responsible for this mis-regulation. in that regard, it will be interesting to test the epigenetic modification of this region in cancer cells. overall, the cluster of yy <dig> binding sites described in the current study represents a very unique example of eukaryotic cis-regulatory region.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study has identified a very unusual cluster of yy <dig> binding sites within its own gene locus, prompting a potential autoregulation mechanism for yy <dig> transcription. consistently, the overall cellular levels of yy <dig> protein were shown to affect  the transcription levels of the endogenous yy <dig> locus. also, this control appears to be mediated through its own yy <dig> binding sites. this suggests that yy <dig> is likely self-regulated through its own binding sites.
