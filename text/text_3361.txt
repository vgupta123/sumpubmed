BACKGROUND
f-spondin was initially identified in the rat embryo floor plate <cit> , a ventralizing structure implicated in the control of neural cell patterning and axon growth in the developing vertebrate nervous system. the expression level of f-spondin is high in the floor plate at the time of axon extension <cit> . further studies have found that f-spondin plays an important role in the outgrowth of sensory <cit> , commissural <cit>  and hippocampal <cit>  neurons during development as well as in the migration of distinct somite domains to neural crest <cit> . f-spondin is an extracellular matrix  protein with multiple domains, including an n-terminal domain  <cit> , an f-spondin  domain and six thrombospondin type  <dig> repeats  . f-spondin, which is secreted by cells within the floor plate, is proteolytically processed into fragments that differentially bind to the floor plate cells or the basement membrane <cit> . the portion that binds to the floor plate cells acts as a short-range repellent of commissural axons and prevents their migration into the floor plate. other portions of f-spondin that includes the fs domain accumulate at the basement membrane and support growth cone migration <cit> . the proteolysis of f-spondin and the coordinated interaction of the different fragments with the membrane of floor plate and the basement membrane provide a combinatorial guidance signal for commissural axons that cross the midline <cit> . f-spondin is also highly up-regulated in injured peripheral nerves and it promotes outgrowth of sensory neurons <cit> . an antibody against the fs domain blocks neurite outgrowth, indicating the fs domain plays an active role in axon regeneration <cit> . this observation is largely in agreement with the fact that an f-spondin fragment that lacks the tsrs is sufficient to promote neuronal differentiation <cit> .

the expression of f-spondin indicates that it also functions outside the nervous system. f-spondin is expressed in various organs including the ovary, lung, kidney, small intestine, prostate <cit>  and testis <cit> . human and bovine f-spondins, initially called vascular smooth muscle cell  growth-promoting factor , were first cloned from ovarian cdna libraries, and bovine f-spondin was purified from adult bovine ovarian follicular fluid <cit> . f-spondin may be a major factor for smc proliferation in the ovary. in vitro experiments suggested that f-spondin may also contribute to the inhibition of angiogenesis via the functional blockade of endothelial integrin αvβ <dig>  which plays important roles in angiogenesis <cit> . it has been recently shown that f-spondin is a promoter for cementoblastic differentiation <cit> . the molecule is up-regulated in osteoarthritis, promoting prostaglandin production, collagen degradation and proteoglycan synthesis reduction, probably via the activation of latent tgf-β <cit> .

the first identification of ligands for f-spondin came from the studies of the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease <cit> . amyloid precursor protein  is a type i membrane protein. its extracellular domain is initially cleaved by α- or β-secretases and subsequently by γ-secretase to secrete small peptides including aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  which are the primary components of the amyloid-β fibrils found in alzheimer's disease. f-spondin interacts with the extracellular domain of app, blocks app cleavage by β-secretases, and eventually inhibits the production of the aβ peptides by γ-secretase <cit> . a working model suggested that f-spondin forms a heterotrimer assembly on the membrane with app and apolipoprotein e receptor  <dig>  in which the reelin_n domain and the fs domain interact with app and tsrs interact with apoer <dig> <cit> .

recently, the structure of mindin fs domain has been reported <cit> . mindin is a member of the mindin/f-spondin family <cit>  and an integrin-binding and pattern-recognition molecule for microbial pathgens <cit> . in this paper, we present the crystal structure of human f-spondin fs domain. with the structures of the n-terminal  domain <cit>  and tsrs <cit>  of f-spondin characterized, the structure of fs-domain is the last to be determined and studied.

RESULTS
overview of fs domain structure
the core of the fs domain has an 8-stranded β-sandwich fold, with strands β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  and β <dig> forming one β-sheet and strands β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> forming the other sheet . the topology represents one of two types of c <dig> domain β-sandwich folds <cit> . the first major variation of the fs domain, as compared to a common c <dig> domain, is its long linker  between β <dig> and β <dig> strands, which actually forms two anti-parallel α-helices, packed against the β3/β2/β5/β <dig> sheet. the second variation is its long linker  between the β <dig> and β <dig> strands. the linker first crosses over to the β3/β2/β5/β <dig> sheet and forms a short strand, β7'  that is anti-parallel to the edge strand, β <dig> . it then runs above the β5-β <dig> loop and turns back at y <dig>  the linker forms a second short strand, β7" , by β7'. the addition of the two short strands is an expansion of the β3/β2/β5/β <dig> sheet to a 6-stranded sheet. additionally, a part of the loop between β <dig> and α <dig>  runs in an anti-parallel fashion by the β7" strand, forming two mainchain-mainchain hydrogen bonds with the residue i <dig> right before β7". these two interactions  do not define another β strand.

the residues contributing to the hydrophobic core of the fs domain are a <dig>  y <dig>  l <dig> and f <dig> of the β <dig> strand, i <dig> of the β <dig> strand, f <dig> and v <dig> of the β <dig> strand, m <dig> and f <dig> of the β <dig> strand, as well as a <dig>  v <dig> and i <dig> of the β <dig> strand . based on the sequence conservation of these residues among fs domains of f-spondins, mindins, m-spondin as well as amphif-spondin, we predict that a c <dig> domain core structure should be conserved in these proteins.

disulfide bond pattern
the three consecutive cysteines  before the β <dig> strands form three disulfide bonds with c <dig> and c <dig> from the β6-β <dig> loop, and c <dig> after the β <dig> strand at the c-terminal region, respectively . none of these disulfide bonds is located within the core of the β-sandwich domain. they are all at the bottom of the fs domain and are associated with n- and c-termini, especially the n-terminus, where they seem to help define and stabilize the globular fs domain . the construct for protein expression begins from v <dig>  in the electron density maps, d <dig> is the first n-terminal residue visible while the other seven residues together with  <dig> vector-derived residues were disordered in the structure. interestingly, after the β <dig> strand, about  <dig> residues between c <dig> and d <dig> are clear in the electron density maps. two of them, i <dig> and v <dig>  form a short strand  parallel to β <dig>  providing structural stability to the c-terminal loop region after c <dig> 

there is a noticeable difference in the number of disulfide bonds in the fs domains of f-spondin and mindin. early understanding of the fs domain structure was based on two very conserved sequence repeats, fs <dig> and fs <dig>  which were suggested to represent two individual domains <cit> . however, an analysis based on the number of cysteine residues and their distribution actually suggested a disulfide bond pattern that was not in agreement with the early prediction. in the f-spondin fs domain, there are six cysteines, designated c to c. c are in the fs <dig> repeat, c are in the fs <dig> repeat and c is in a region after fs <dig>  in mindin, only c and c exist, suggesting a possible disulfide bond c-c linking fs <dig> and fs <dig>  in amphif-spondin, c and c are both missing and are replaced by a pair of hydrogen bond forming residues, t <dig> and q <dig> . this implies the second disulfide bond c-c is also between fs <dig> and fs <dig> in other proteins. the remaining cysteine ) of fs <dig> likely forms the third disulfide bond with c after fs <dig>  these results are consistent with the conclusion that fs <dig> and fs <dig> are most likely within a single domain. the functionality and the evolution of the varied disulfide bond patterns are unknown. a phylogenetic analysis using the alignment in figure  <dig> as an input suggests that fs domains of f-spondins and mindins have evolved separately from their common ancestor <cit> . the result largely agrees with the observation that the numbers and the positions of the exons that cover fs domains in genomic dnas are different between f-spondins and mindins.

c-termini of fs domains
the c-terminal region of fs domains is one of the most diversified regions in the amino acid sequences . the location of the c-terminus of f-spondin or mindin is different according to the structures of their fs domains. in the construct of mindin <cit> , the c-terminus was truncated at r <dig>  which is equivalent to e <dig> of f-spondin. in the structure reported here, e <dig> is before c <dig> and on the structured c-terminal loop between the β <dig> and the β8' strands. in mindin, there is no disulfide bond tethering its c-terminal region to its n-terminus. the end of the β <dig> strand is l <dig> and the following residue r <dig> starts to peel off from the mindin fs domain , resulting in disordering of most of the other c-terminal residues of the construct <cit> . in f-spondin, residue a <dig>  the equivalent of r <dig> in mindin, is the third residue from the end of the β <dig> strand . the c-terminal loop region observed in f-spondin seemingly extends the c-termini of the fs domain to at least v <dig> . we note that exon  <dig> of human f-spondin genomic dna encodes the c-terminal region of the fs domain, from g <dig> to e <dig>  it is possible that the c-terminus of f-spondin fs domain extends much beyond the disulfide bond formed by c <dig>  however, we can't exclude the possibility that the c-terminal structured region  results from molecular packing in the crystal.

n-linked glycosylation, ca2+- and so42- -binding sites
there is one n-linked glycosylation site  at the end of the β <dig> strand in the fs domain . the common pentasaccharide core of the linked glycans is visible in the electron densities. two branched mannose residues were not built in the final model due to their weak densities. like other proteins that we have expressed in drosophila s <dig>  the n-linked glycans are not fully processed <cit> . the post-translational modification in the fs domain is conserved only in f-spondins while in mindins only zebrafish mindin- <dig> and - <dig> fs domains are glycosylated, at different sites .

associated with the short strands at the top of the fs domain, there is a solvent-accessible ca2+-binding site, formed from d <dig> , d <dig>  and d <dig> . the site also contains three coordinating water molecules in an approximately octahedral coordination geometry . all three aspartic acids are from the two highly conserved and characteristic fs domain "repeats", p322spdw and d354agtd   <cit> . both d <dig> and d <dig> interact with the ca2+ ion as bidentate ligands involving both carboxyl groups with bond distances of  <dig>  Å/ <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å/ <dig>  Å, respectively. interestingly, d <dig> interacts with the ca2+ ion with only its mainchain carbonyl group  though the residue is part of a highly conserved motif. all three aspartic acids and three coordinating waters  are part of an extensive hydrogen bond network. the geometry of the metal-binding site, including bond distances, coordination <cit>  as well as the similar b-factors of the ca2+ ion  and its surround protein atoms , support the metal ion assignment.

three sulfate groups from the crystallization buffer that included  <dig> m lithium sulfate monohydrate have also been identified in the structure . one of them is inside a pocket near the bottom of the domain . the other two sulfate groups, labeled as so <dig> and so <dig> in figure  <dig>  are associated with two consecutive arginines, r <dig> and r <dig>  on one side of the top of the fs domain. the so <dig> occupies a special position with 2-fold crystallographic symmetry, and binds the residues r <dig> and r <dig>  and the same residues from an adjacent, symmetry-related fs molecule.

structural homologues
the primary sequence identity of the fs domains between f-spondin  and mindin  is  <dig> %. a secondary-structure matching  superposition <cit>  of two molecules yields a core root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å with  <dig> residues from each aligned . in the alignment, there are eight gaps, all in loop regions with the major difference  occurring before the β4-strand and creating a protrusion from the edge of the β4/β1/β8/β <dig> sheet. the protrusion is accompanied by the n-linked glycans extended from the end of the neighboring β1-strand as described earlier.

a dali structural homology search  using the f-spondin fs domain found a large number of fits , including the n-terminal ca2+-dependent lipid-binding/c <dig> domain of cytosolic phospholipase a <dig>   <cit> . in the structural alignments of the fs domain with these c <dig> domains, only the core of the fs domain  can be superimposed, indicating that the fs domain represents a derivative of a common c <dig> domain . though helices are commonly found within the linker between two strands in c <dig> domain structures, the two nearly anti-parallel helices within the loop between the β <dig> and β <dig> strands and the unusual long loop between the β <dig> and β <dig> strands found in the fs domain are unique to fs domains only.

implication of potential interactions
membrane targeting is an important part of axon guidance of the proteolytic fragment of f-spondin that includes the fs domain. the unexpected identification of a c <dig> domain homology with the fs domain and the presence of ca2+- and so42--binding sites implies potential roles of this domain in the interaction of f-spondin with membrane and/or membrane associated molecules.

the c <dig> domain is the second most abundant lipid binding domain behind the pleckstrin homology  domain <cit> . though the c <dig> domain can fold individually with a highly conserved common β-sandwich core, it seems to be a modular domain that is found in a large number of multiple domain proteins involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking. most of the c <dig> domain-containing molecules that have been studied to date are either soluble proteins or membrane proteins. the fs domain structures of mindin and f-spondin represent the first examples of structures from ecm proteins that contain a c2-domain or rather a c2-domain derivative. the individual c <dig> domains commonly participate in ca2+-dependent membrane binding in ca2+-mediated cell processes.

in most cases, the membrane-binding and/or lipid binding of c <dig> domains is dependent on the ca2+-binding site, though the number of ca2+ binding-sites and their positions at the top of the domains are variable <cit> . ca2+ ions can  function as an electrostatic switch for favorable ionic interaction with the anionic membrane,  form a bridge between the c <dig> domain and anionic phospholipids, or  induce conformational changes that lead to protein-membrane interactions <cit> . the exact methods for the c <dig> domain interaction with membranes, including lipid selectivity, may be dependent on the number of ca2+-binding sites and the conformation of each ca2+-binding site. additionally, protein-membrane associations mediated by divalent metals, especially ca2+ ions, have been reported in many other proteins, including vitamin-k-dependent proteins, annexins and pentraxins <cit> .

the presence of a sulfate group from crystallization buffer in a crystal structure could be an indicator of a binding site of an anionic group of a potential ligand, such as heparin  and lipid . the arginines, r <dig> and r <dig>  on one side of the top of the fs domain could contribute to a binding site for the phosphate head group of a lipid. it is interesting that r <dig> is conserved between f-spondins and mindins while r <dig> in mindins is replaced by a proline . heparin-binding has been demonstrated for f-spondin's n-terminal reelin_n domain <cit> , which is adjacent to the fs domain . the potential for the two consecutive arginines r <dig> and r <dig> of the fs domain to bind heparin in synergy with the reelin_n domain remains to be explored. the presence of two sulfate groups, especially so <dig> at a crystallographic special position, could be an artifact of molecular packing. the heparin-binding, or more generally glycosaminoglycan -binding, implies another potential pathway for targeting the membrane through the interaction with membrane-associated gags such as those from transmembrane proteoglycans.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of f-spondin fs domain, together with mindin fs domain, represents the first examples of c <dig> domain-like structures in ecm proteins. although the two fs domains have similar overall structures, they have evolved separately from their common ancestor. the integrin-binding motif found in mindin is not conserved in the f-spondin fs domain. the f-spondin fs domain is unique with a conserved n-glycosylation site and three disulfide bonds, which may play critical roles in protein folding and stability as well as defining domain boundaries. the homology of its core structure to a common ca2+- and lipid-binding c <dig> domain suggests that the f-spondin fs domain may be responsible for part of the membrane targeting of f-spondin in its regulation of axon development. the structure of the f-spondin fs domain completes the structural studies of the multiple domain ecm molecule and its properties revealed in this study pave the way for further exploration into the functions of f-spondin.
