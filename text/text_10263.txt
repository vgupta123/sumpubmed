BACKGROUND
crop cultivars have low levels of genetic diversity but high frequencies of recombination
 <cit> . cultivars contain specific sequence blocks in their chromosomes, which may be associated with artificially selected phenotypic variations from many generations of breeding. in contrast with wild species , cultivar genomes consist of genetically reshuffled recombination blocks that arose from breeding ancestors 
 <cit> . for example, because the history of soybean breeding is too short for mutation accumulations , the recombination blocks from common ancestors are usually identical in different cultivars, except for a small number of variations that are adjacent to the recombination points
 <cit> . therefore, as large-scale genome sequence data become available, the recombination block-based analysis is emerging as an efficient approach for comparing bred cultivar genomes with enough precision to detect molecular breeding targets.

traditionally, recombination block identification has focused primarily on detecting linkage disequilibrium  blocks, which can be determined by calculating the correlations of neighboring alleles. combinations of alleles that are observed in the expected correlations are said to be in linkage equilibrium. in contrast, ld is higher-than-expected correlations between alleles at two loci that originate from single, ancestral chromosomes
 <cit> . based on the ld block calculation, it is possible to discover the haplotype block structure of a whole-genome
 <cit> . whole haplotype maps of a few model organisms have been created using ld blocks
 <cit> . to generate a reliable whole-genome haplotype map, it is needed to calculate the pairwise linkage disequilibrium between the single nucleotide variations  in many samples
 <cit> . for this reason, maps have been generated from only a few model plants, including arabidopsis and maize
 <cit> .

recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing by next-generation sequencing technology has been employed for recombinant inbred line  genotyping and even for linkage analyses to search for recombination breakpoints. however, the resulting data are prone to high error rates due to the relatively low levels of sequencing coverage that are typically attained. to overcome this drawback, a “bin” concept was introduced for the rice genome. specifically, the sliding-window approach
 <cit>  and the hidden markov model
 <cit>  were used to construct “bin maps” using the low-coverage sequence data. the bin map was successfully employed to reveal quantitative trait loci  that contained genes that are related to rice grain width
 <cit> . however, there are some limitations to the usefulness of the bin-based method. namely, almost all of the ril individuals have to be sequenced to detect useful qtls. furthermore, a bin map of a ril group cannot be reused for other ril groups. however, if generally applicable comparative analysis methods are developed to identify bins, the effort and expense required to search for genes that are related to the target traits will be reduced.

genomic analyses of various crops using whole-genome sequencing data have been previously reported. these include the analysis of  <dig> cultivated and wild soybean genomes using ~5× sequencing
 <cit> , genome-wide association studies of  <dig> rice varieties using ~1× sequencing
 <cit> , the identification of candidate regions that were selected during the domestication of  <dig> rice accessions using ~15× sequencing
 <cit> , and a breeding-associated genetic regulation analysis of  <dig> chickpea genomes using ~ <dig> × sequencing
 <cit> . integrating such large-scale genomic data will accelerate the screening of loci that are related to the valuable target traits.

here, we propose a variation block  method using next-generation sequencing data for the detection and analysis of recombination patterns in the genomes of crop species. the rationale behind the vb method is the existence of reshuffled sequence blocks within crop varieties that originated from a limited number of ancestral contributors and were introduced relatively recently over the course of the past several decades
 <cit> . we suggest that such sequence blocks can be detected by identifying the snv density profiles and that the resulting sequence blocks represent recombination blocks. we demonstrate the general applicability of the vb method by applying it to the publicly accessible genomes of  <dig> soybean and  <dig> rice accessions. finally, by using a small number of insertion/deletion  markers, each of which is specific to a recombination block, we identified a putative locus for soybean hilum color with minimal screening. with the increasing availability of genome sequences, the vb method shows promise as a useful genomic selection technology for crop improvement.

RESULTS
whole-genome sequencing of cultivated soybeans
five soybean  merr.) cultivar genomes were sequenced. two were parental cultivars , and two represented their crossed descendants   and were used to detect inherited genome-wide recombination events. one of the descendants, daepoong, has the highest productivity among korean soybean cultivars  with excellent yield stability. we also used another elite line, hwangkeum, which is not a member of this family but is popular for its attractive color and bean size. we produced paired-end dna reads of 40–60-fold depths  for the five cultivar genomes and mapped them to the williams  <dig> reference 
 <cit> . the sequencing qualities of all the samples were high; 94%–99% of the cultivar sample reads were mapped to the reference, and 97%–99% of the reference genome was covered. a williams  <dig> genome was also sequenced under the same conditions at a ~60-fold depth to reduce the base-calling noise. additionally, g. soja <cit> , which is an undomesticated ancestor of g. max, was used as a control and analyzed with the same method.

comparative analysis procedure for cultivated soybean genomes using vb
the main objective of the vb method is to compare the reshuffled genome sequences of bred cultivars. a three-step process was applied to determine and compare the recombination blocks in the five soybean genomes .

• step  <dig>  snv detection: snvs and indels were detected by comparing bred soybean genomes with a reference genome . there were a total of  <dig> , <dig> non-redundant snvs  and a total of  <dig>  small indels  in the five korean soybean cultivars . of these snvs,  <dig> , <dig> were novel . the snvs were highly clustered in certain chromosomal regions, whereas the regions that were genomically identical to the williams  <dig> reference showed few or no snvs.

• step  <dig>  determination of vbs: two types of blocks were determined: the sparse variation blocks , which are identical or nearly identical to the reference sequence, and the dense variation blocks , which contain many variations . the boundaries of the dvbs and svbs were regarded as recombination sites. the vbs are thus defined as the sequence fragments that are split by all of the assumed recombination sites. in the five soybean genomes, 30–47% of the regions were dvbs . as expected, in the resequenced williams  <dig> genome, only a fraction of the regions  were dvbs, which appeared probably due to individual differences between the two williams  <dig> cultivars. by contrast, most of the regions in the g. soja genome  were dvbs, indicating that the genetic pool of g. soja has been rarely used to breed williams  <dig> and the five cultivars that were sequenced in this study.

most of the snvs  were located in dvbs, even though the dvbs occupied less than half of the genome . a total of  <dig>  svbs and dvbs were identified in the five genomes, along with  <dig>  boundary sites that demarcated the vbs. figure 
 <dig> shows an overview of the block structures of all of the chromosomes  and the detailed structure of chromosome  <dig> . after eliminating redundancy, a total of  <dig>  recombination sites and a set of  <dig>  vbs covered the entire genomic region .

recombination occurs more frequently in gene-rich regions than in gene-sparse regions
 <cit> . consistent with this, we confirmed a strong positive correlation  between the gene density and vb density in the soybean genome. as a result, short vbs  were found mainly in regions with the highest gene densities , whereas most of the very long vbs were located in heterochromatic regions . this observation is consistent with previous studies that reported the suppression of recombination in the heterochromatin of various crops, such as sorghum and tomato
 <cit> .

interestingly, there were identical variation patterns consistently appearing in the same regions of the examined genomes, indicating that these regions were inherited from common ancestors. the existence of boundaries that demarcate the dvbs and svbs indicates that recombination has occurred at least once during breeding.• step  <dig>  block comparison: the identity of each vb at specific locations was compared to all of the other vbs within the aligned column among the cultivar genomes . to compare the vbs among the genomes, two vbs were considered to be of an identical type and thus to have originated from a common parental genome when they had ≥ <dig> % sequence identity as well as ≥ <dig>  snv concordance . snv concordance refers to the extent to which all the snvs that are present in a vb are identical between genomes. applying these thresholds, 98% of the vb types in the descendants  were present in the parents . figure 
4b shows a comparison of vb types between shingi and its parents. the resulting information was used to analyze the reshuffling patterns of the parental genomes in the descendants .almost all of the descendant chromosomal regions were present in the corresponding parental lines. however, some of the remaining  regions, such as an  <dig> -mb block in chromosome  <dig> of shingi , were not observed similarly in the parental genomes, likely because the two individual parental plants that were used in this analysis are not the direct ancestors of the descendant cultivars.

robustness of vb detection with respect to sequencing depth
we evaluated the performance of the vb detection at various sequencing depths and found that the vb method remained accurate even with 5-fold depths of mapping data . the performance of the vb method depends on that of the snv calling, which, in turn, depends on the sequencing read depths. in our analysis, the sensitivity of the homologous snv detection decreased dramatically at depths of <10-fold, amounting to 79% at a 6-fold depth and 73% at a 5-fold depth . nevertheless, even with the deterioration of the snv-calling sensitivity, the sensitivity of the vb method remained greater than 90%, even at a 6-fold depth. at an 8-fold depth, the sensitivity and precision of vb detection reached approximately 95% of the highest values. therefore, the vb method is very robust with respect to sequencing depths.

vb-based analysis of publicly available soybean and rice genomes
to assess its general applicability, we applied the vb method to two sets of publicly available genomes of  <dig> soybean lines and  <dig> rice accessions
 <cit> .

the  <dig> publicly available soybean genomes consisted of  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> wild soybeans
 <cit> . all of them were chinese except for three cultivars from brazil, taiwan, and the usa. nevertheless, for simplicity, all the  <dig> soybean types will be referred to collectively as “chinese soybeans”. on average, the sequencing depth was 5-fold, which should thus allow for the attainment of at least 89% sensitivity and 88% precision according to depth-performance calibration . the vb method was successfully employed to analyze all but one cultivar genome that had distinctly fewer snvs than did the others. as in the five korean soybean cultivars, each of the  <dig> chinese cultivar genomes also contained snvs that were clustered in certain chromosomal regions with distinct snv density profiles . there were a total of  <dig>  recombination sites, which was  <dig> -fold higher than those that were observed in the five korean soybean genomes, likely due to the higher number of analyzed genomes. more than half  of the recombination sites in the five korean soybean genomes coincided with those in the  <dig> chinese cultivar genomes. the remaining 38% may reflect differences in the genetic pools between the chinese and korean soybeans.

the  <dig> wild soybeans had much fewer svbs than did the cultivated soybeans. an average of 31% of the genomic regions of the wild soybeans contained svbs, and there were a total of  <dig>  recombination sites, 43%  of which coincided with those of the  <dig> cultivars. these observations suggest that the  <dig> wild soybeans might have had opportunities to outcross with the ancestors of the cultivated soybeans. to assess the value of the wild soybean genomes as genetic resources, we determined the number of vbs that are shared between the cultivated and wild soybean genomes. many  vbs from the cultivar genomes were present in at least one of the wild soybean genomes. by contrast, far fewer  vbs from the wild soybean genomes were present in the cultivar genomes , suggesting that wild soybeans have a much more diverse genetic pool than do the cultivars.

we next demonstrated that the vb method can be applied to monocot crops, such as rice. the procedures that were used in the soybean genome analysis were directly applied to rice genomes . we selected a total of  <dig> oryza sativa spp. japonica genomes from  <dig> rice accessions that were reported in a previous study
 <cit> . the following three varieties were included: seven temperate japonica , ten tropical japonica , and six aromatic  varieties. the average mapping depth of the sequencing data was approximately 14-fold, which is sufficient for accurate vb-based analysis . a total of  <dig>  recombination sites were found in the rice genomes. only  <dig> %  of the sites were present in all three groups . the seven temperate and ten tropical japonica genomes shared more than twice as many recombination sites as those that were shared with the six aromatic genomes. the resulting vb patterns indicated that the three groups are characterized by visually distinct snv density profiles . the six aromatic varieties had the most distinct patterns. these findings are consistent with the conclusions of the original report, which were based on sequence homology
 <cit> .

quantification of genome diversity of crop population in terms of vbs
vbs were used to quantitatively estimate the genome diversities of crop populations. whereas a sequence-based comparison infers the homology of genomes that have diverged via natural evolution , a block-based comparison determines whether two blocks from two genomes originated from the same parental genome .

we examined the genome diversity by calculating the “vb diversity score”, which is defined as the number of unique vb types per the number of all vb sites in a genome. the steps for the calculation of the vb diversity score are illustrated in additional file
10: figure s7a–c. the resulting graphs revealed differences in diversity among the four groups of crops . the  <dig> chinese soybean cultivar genomes produced the most smoothly increasing curve of vb diversity scores that eventually leveled off, indicating limited genome diversity in the cultivars. in comparison, wild soybeans produced a steeply increasing irregular curve that did not level off, indicating diverse vb compositions. the genetic diversity of the five korean soybeans can also be seen . the two parental genomes  had a score of  <dig> , which was similar to the score of the first two genomes in the other soybean groups.

the three subgroups of rice genomes showed distinguishable patterns representing subgroups of unique recombination sites . the curve for temperate japonica was the most irregular among the three subgroups. the vb diversity scores of the rice genomes were much lower than those of the  <dig> cultivated soybean genomes.

vbs as recombination blocks
experimental validation supported that vbs are genuine recombination blocks. we determined the recombination frequencies in the  <dig> – <dig>  mb region of chromosome  <dig> in 614 f <dig> progenies of rils, which were the progenies of the cross that was made between hwangkeum and daepoong . in this  <dig> -mb region, hwangkeum had three dvbs that were 140 kb, 300 kb, and 190 kb in length alternating with three svbs, whereas daepoong had only one long svb. the three svb regions were of identical types between daepoong and hwangkeum.the analysis of the recombination frequencies in the  <dig> rils showed that at least  <dig>  times more recombination events occurred in the svbs than in the dvbs. a total of nine and  <dig> recombination events occurred in 630 kb of dvbs and  <dig>  kb of svbs, respectively. this indicates that the more similar two sequences are, the more frequently recombination events occur. this relationship is consistent with a previous study that reported reduced recombination rates in regions surrounding non-alignable flanking sequences, such as snvs and indels
 <cit> .

the genetic linkage distances and vb lengths were also compared. vb-specific indel markers were used to determine the recombination status of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> for the f <dig> rils that are described above. genetic and physical maps were constructed using markers that could distinguish between the dvb types of two cultivars, as described in the methods section. we found very large vbs within very short genetic distances. five vbs that were larger than 2 mb were located within  <dig>  cm of chromosome  <dig>  , and two large vbs of 12 mb and  <dig>  mb were found within  <dig>  cm of chromosome  <dig>  . these results indicate that vbs are recombination units that rarely split.

identification of the locus determining soybean hilum color
finally, we showed the practicability of the vb method for map-based screening by identifying a putative locus that determines soybean hilum color. although hilum color is thought to be related to the i locus on chromosome 8
 <cit> , the exact locus has not yet been identified. using the vb method, we attempted to detect the hilum color-determining locus. as a result, the entire screening process for narrowing down the target region required only the following three steps in the 614 f <dig> progenies of rils that were selected from the cross of hwangkeum  and daepoong  .

we began by selecting  <dig>  indel markers that were longer than four base pairs, which allowed for the discrimination of the vbs from hwangkeum from those from daepoong . among these indel markers, the first screening was performed with  <dig> markers in all  <dig> chromosomes, each of which represented a single vb that was identified from the hwangkeum and daepoong genomes. the hk <dig> marker on chromosome  <dig> had the highest correlation  with the hilum color phenotype . the second step was performed with five markers that represented one of the five dvbs near hk <dig>  because recombination events within the dvbs occurred rarely, as described in the previous section, one marker was sufficient to represent one dvb. we found that the target locus was in a 300-kb dvb spanning the  <dig> – <dig>  mb region , which showed the highest correlation with the hilum color phenotype. the final step was performed with seven markers  to locate the exact hilum color-determining locus, which was located in a very large block of approximately 197 kb.

to identify the locus that determines hilum color, a comparative analysis was conducted. soybean seed coats and hilum color are regulated by chalcone synthase  genes that control the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin pigments via a posttranscriptional mode of gene silencing
 <cit> . therefore, we compared the sequence differences for daepoong and hwangkeum of chss in the i locus, which is located close to the hd <dig>  marker in the 197-kb block. there were no significant sequence differences except for one non-synonymous snv in chs <dig> of the i locus , which cannot affect the regulation of gene silencing mechanisms between two sequences in this region. instead, we found that two highly similar  genes, chs <dig> and chs <dig>  were present as inverted repeats near the hd <dig>  marker downstream of the i locus . except for these chss, there were no genes that are involved in the anthocyanin metabolic pathway in this 197-kb block. we concluded that an inverted repeat structure of chs <dig> and chs <dig> is a candidate locus for hilum color determination.

we compared the sequence differences among the six soybean cultivars in the 197-kb block and found that the only notable difference was a 5-bp deletion in the chs <dig> promoter regions of every genome except for hwangkeum . if the expression of chs <dig> and chs <dig> is regulated by a gene silencing mechanism that is similar to that of the ii allele on the i locus, then these two genes may be silenced in hwangkeum, which has an intact chs <dig> promoter. however, if the 5-bp deletion inhibits promoter activity, chs <dig> would not be silenced due to the absence of interfering rna. therefore, the 5-bp deletion may produce dark-colored hila in all of the soybeans except for hwangkeum. we also examined  <dig> other soybean cultivars and found that the 5-bp deletion perfectly correlated with colored hila . we named this putative locus hc, in which the ih and ih alleles control the yellow and brown hilum colors, respectively. these results suggest that the seed color phenotype of hwangkeum is determined by two linked loci, consisting of the ii allele  of the i locus and the ih allele  of the hc locus.

discussion
we proposed an efficient recombination block detection method that is based on genomic variation patterns. this method provides key information for the map-based screening of bred cultivars. the vb method can be applied to various crop species that have available reference genomes. in this study, representative monocot and dicot model crops, rice and soybeans, were successfully analyzed using the vb method.

the vb-based comparative genomics method has several advantages over other methods. the first advantage is that the samples can be compared directly at the block level. therefore, an agricultural trait-associated locus or gene can be identified with reduced screening efforts by using a small number of markers that represent the vbs. we demonstrated this advantage by identifying a putative locus determining hilum color in soybeans. there is no need to use markers on the vbs of the same type that are present in two genomes, such as the rear half of gm <dig>  the middle of gm <dig>  and the front half of gm <dig> in the 1st pass . the vbs were also useful in the 2nd pass of the screening. since vbs are the units that rarely split by recombination, only one marker can represent one dvb. in this report, only five markers were used to screen five dvbs in the 2 mb target region . these results indicate that the vb method enables the minimal use of molecular markers and efficient screening via an accurate recombination map. map-based cloning in soybeans has thus far identified few genes
 <cit> , and this method represents a significant advancement.

the second advantage is that the vb method does not depend on the number of samples. in contrast to other statistical methods, such as the ld analysis, the vb method can identify recombination blocks using only one genome if a reference genome sequence is available. this feature is especially useful in genomic screening against ril populations. even with the availability of only two parental genome sequences, researchers can still define the vb blocks, compare the two genomes at the recombination block level, and predict the possible recombination sites that are likely to occur in the ril population.

the third advantage is that the vb method can accurately detect recombination blocks even with low-depth sequencing data. the vb method detected recombination blocks with more than 90% sensitivity and precision even with 6-fold depth data.there were many chromosomal regions that have the same types of vbs across multiple genomes, reflecting the limited genetic diversity resulting from artificial selection during the breeding history. as shown in figure 
8a, the identical regions showed  <dig>  times higher recombination rates than those of the other regions. in contrast, recombination occurs randomly in wild-type genomes, which rarely share identical regions with each other. these results imply that low genetic diversity can lead to non-random recombination, followed by the conservation of vbs.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we propose the vb method for the identification and comparison of the reshuffled genome sequences of bred cultivars. we demonstrated the usefulness and generality of the vb method by applying it to the publicly available genomes of  <dig> soybeans and  <dig> rice accessions. the vb-representing indel markers accurately identified a putative locus that determines the yellow hilum color in soybean. thus, the vb method is applicable in the cloning of agronomically important genes in a simple and fast manner.
