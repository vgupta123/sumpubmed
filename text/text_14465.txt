BACKGROUND
fish egg quality is defined as the capability of an egg to become fertilized and subsequently develop into a normal embryo or the probability of eggs to exhibit low mortalities at fertilization, eyeing, hatching, and first feeding  <cit> . the production of high quality eggs is a major objective of the aquaculture industry, as egg quality not only affects fertilization rate, but also is an important attribute of robust embryonic development  <cit> . however, visible differences between good and bad eggs at oviposition is not usually conspicuous in rainbow trout, and therefore, the inclusion of eggs from individual females with poor egg quality into mass incubation units not only results in unexpected losses in egg production, but also problems associated with the removal of dead eggs and embryos after fertilization and fungi infection in the hatchery  <cit> . therefore, enabling evaluation of the egg quality before fertilization is highly desirable in aquaculture production.

in teleost fish, a mature egg is developed through multiple phases, including primary oocyte growth, secondary growth including the cortical alveolus stage and vitellogenesis, follicle maturation and ovulation  <cit> . the coordinated multiple developmental stages can be affected by many genetic, biological, and environmental factors  <cit> . it has been reported that the quality of rainbow trout eggs is dependent not only on the genetic characteristics of parents  <cit> , but also the age of female  <cit> , and are susceptible to environmental influences, such as the diet of brood fish  <cit> , stress  <cit> , photoperiod  <cit> , and the physiochemical conditions of the water  <cit> . all of these factors make egg quality highly variable and difficult to control  <cit> . as the ovulated eggs in reared rainbow trout do not usually oviposit naturally, post-ovulatory aging of the eggs is widely accepted as a common determinant for egg quality  <cit> .

the importance to distinguish good and bad quality eggs before fertilization has driven studies on the identification of markers associated with egg quality in rainbow trout. wojtczak and coworkers found that very poor quality eggs turn water turbid  <cit> . egg survival rate has also been associated with aspects of egg composition  <cit> . the total amount of water imbibed after 30 minute incubation has been recognized as an indicator of egg quality  <cit> . in addition, molecular markers that are potential indicators of egg quality have also been reported. such markers include the maternally-derived igf-i and igf-ii  <cit> , and lvii fragments as well as other proteins identified from the coelomic fluid  <cit> . many specific genes that are potentially involved in the regulation of oocyte maturation, egg developmental potential, and embryo survival were identified by microarray and quantitative real time pcr  analyses  <cit> . although the above studies have attempted to address the critical factors responsible for the observed variability of egg quality, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the regulation of egg quality in rainbow trout remain largely elusive.

recent advances in epigenetic research have demonstrated that the evolutionarily conserved micrornas  play important roles in differentiation and maturation of various cell types  <cit> . in zebrafish, mutant embryos lacking mature mirnas had severe deformity during embryogenesis  <cit> . in mouse, although the mirna functions are suppressed during oocyte maturation, the maternal mirnas are critical to normal embryonic development  <cit> . in addition, many mirnas have been shown to play roles in programmed cell death  <cit> . a comprehensive review of mirnas in teleost fish development, reproduction and response to environmental stimuli was published recently  <cit> . in order to identify the mirnas that might play important roles in oocyte and embryonic development in rainbow trout, the expression of mirnas in rainbow trout eggs and early embryos have been studied and some novel egg-predominant mirnas were identified  <cit> . in this study, post-ovulatory aged rainbow trout eggs with different qualities were collected and used to generate mirna transcriptome profiles for identifying specific mirnas associated with egg quality, which could potentially be used as biomarkers for evaluating egg quality. the study also provides new information and insights for future studies to elucidate the gene regulatory networks involved in the control of egg quality.

discussion
using deep sequencing in combination with rt-qpcr, we have identified  <dig> mirnas that are associated with egg quality in rainbow trout. these mirnas could potentially be used as biomarkers for prediction of egg quality in rainbow trout. our results showed that the numbers of known and novel mirnas do not show dramatic changes among eggs of different qualities , however, most of the highly expressed mirnas in high quality eggs are known mirnas and most of the highly expressed mirnas in low quality eggs are novel mirnas.

in the study, we used post ovulatory aged eggs with different fertilization rates to identify mirnas that are associated with egg quality. the d1po, d7po and d14po eggs contained both “good” and “bad” eggs of varying proportions resulting from temporal change of eggs held in the body cavity. therefore, the mirnas among these egg samples have only quantitative discrepancy. it is conceivable that identification of evident mirna expression discrepancy among these samples with varying proportion of “good” and “bad” eggs is challenging, and such difficulties have also been documented in previous studies  <cit> . the sybr green based rt-qpcr method for mirna detection has its limitations. as both the universal primer and the mirna specific primer are fixed, it makes optimization of the assay very difficult. only  <dig> mirnas showed specific amplification based on melting curve analysis and many more did not show specific amplifications, although different annealing temperatures were tried.

mitochondrion is not only vital in atp generation and maintenance of cell homeostasis, but also central in the apoptotic signaling pathways  <cit> . it has been reported that some mirnas were involved in the regulation of mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . in this study, one of the differentially expressed novel mirnas, omy-mir-nov-95-5p, was predicted to target mitochondrial gene . cox6b <dig> is known to catalyze the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen in respiratory chain, and deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase is linked to many human diseases  <cit> . therefore, down-regulated expression of omy-mir-nov-95-5p in aged eggs may cause abnormal expression of cox6b <dig>  thereby affecting normal mitochondrial respiratory chain and egg quality. in addition, many predicted target genes of omy-mir-nov-95-5p and omy-mir-193b-5p are associated with significantly enriched go terms, which include cell death, stress response, dna damage and repair, and rna degradation. these genes include rassf <dig>  rpb <dig>  recq4a, chd1l, wdr <dig>  and cnot <dig>  abnormal expression of these important genes may also contribute to decreased quality of d14po eggs. some of the differentially expressed mirnas identified in this study, such as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  have been reported to affect cell death and tumor suppression  <cit> , but the other differentially expressed mirnas have not been characterized with regard to their functions. therefore, a comprehensive study of these mirnas and their target genes would help understanding the factors contributing to egg quality.

many factors can affect mirna expression  <cit> . in rainbow trout, the eggs kept in the cavity for extended time are associated with reduced levels of igf i and igf ii, and increased levels of krt <dig>  ctsz and other transcripts  <cit> . increased activities of got <dig>  acpp, lvii fragments and others biomolecules in the coelomic fluid have also been shown to be related to egg quality  <cit> . in addition, the levels of 17α 20β-p and 17α-oh-p in blood vary significantly before and after ovulation  <cit> . it is not known if these changes may directly or indirectly affect mirna expression, leading to the changes in target gene expression. furthermore, some mirnas have regulatory roles in controlling other mirnas  <cit> . therefore, in order to understand the mechanisms underlying the changes in egg quality such as those associated with post-ovulation aging in rainbow trout, it would be important to systematically study the interaction networks among physiological and environmental factors affecting egg quality, the mirnas and their target genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas that are associated with egg quality in rainbow trout. further characterization of these mirnas, especially the novel ones, and their target genes may provide valuable information on the roles of these mirnas in controlling egg quality, and ultimately lead to the development of novel biomarkers for evaluation of egg quality in rainbow trout.
