BACKGROUND
fungi are osmotrophic microorganisms, which utilize various secreted proteins to obtain nutrients and adapt to ecological niches  <cit> . plant pathogenic fungi secrete diverse groups of small proteins, which have been implicated in the establishment of parasitic relationships. for example, clusters of small secreted protein  genes in ustilago maydis have been shown to be essential for virulence  <cit> , and comparative genomic analysis of eighteen dothideomycetes fungi revealed that pathogenic fungi usually have more predicted ssps compared with their saprotrophic counterparts  <cit> . moreover, most characterized fungal effectors are small secreted proteins, which can manipulate the cellular processes of hosts to facilitate infection  <cit> . therefore, the identification and analysis of ssps has been highlighted in genomic studies assessing many plant pathogenic and symbiotic fungi . however, as a rule, ssps are always highly species-specific and lack similarity to known proteins. for example, in the genomes of the rust fungi melampsora larici-populina and puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, 74% and 84% of predicted ssps are lineage-specific  <cit> . therefore, it remains as a challenge to predict the functions of ssps and discover new effector candidates in non-model fungi.

to date, only very few widely distributed ssps have been described, despite the continually increasing genome/transcriptome data available for fungi. examples of widely distributed fungal ssps include necrosis- and ethylene-inducing-like proteins , which can trigger cell death in a wide range of dicotyledonous hosts by inducing plasma membrane leakage  <cit> . moreover, nlp homologues are also found in many pathogenic bacteria and oomycetes, with a dramatic expansion of nlps in oomycetes observed  <cit> . other representatives are fungal lysm effectors, which enhance pathogen virulence by suppressing the chitin-triggered immunity of host cells. lysm effectors also occur in nonpathogenic fungi; indeed, a lysm effector of the plant-beneficial fungus trichoderma atroviridewas shown to inhibit spore germination of trichoderma spp., implying that lysm effectors have potentially different roles  <cit> . cerato-platanins  are a group of conserved small secreted cysteine-rich proteins found in both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi  <cit> . cps are abundant in many fungal secretomes and potentially have different functions  <cit> . the ecp <dig> effector was originally discovered in the apoplast of cladosporium fulvum infected tomato leaves and shown to be indispensable for c. fulvum virulence  <cit> . a recent in silico study showed that ecp <dig> homologues with conserved ecp2-domains constitute a superfamily and are widely distributed in the subkingdom dikarya  <cit> . some powdery mildew and rust fungi have effector candidates with a conserved y/f/wxc motif at the n-terminus of mature proteins  <cit> . however, y/f/wxc motifs are not restricted to the n-terminal regions and occur at high frequency in non-secreted proteins of other fungi  <cit> .

the ascomycete marssonina brunnea, which belongs to the order of helotiales, is a widespread agent of black spot disease of poplar. m. brunnea causes defoliation and thus growth reduction of susceptible poplar clones, making it a major constraint on poplar plantation. unlike other phytopathogens in helotiales, such as sclerotinia sclerotiorum and botrytis cinerea, which are exemplary necrotrophs with a very wide range of hosts, m. brunnea has a hemibiotrophic lifestyle and displays a high degree of host specialization within the populus genus. the availability of genome sequence of a specific form, m. brunnea f. sp. multigermtubi, provides the opportunity to screen its virulence genes involved in the pathogenesis .

in a previous study, we identified the “species-specific” ssp mbecp <dig> in the secretome of m. brunnea
 <cit> . with the rapid advances in fungal genome sequencing, we reassessed mbecp <dig> and found a gene family encoding mbecp10-like proteins in the genomes of m. brunnea and other dikarya fungi. this family is likely to have a common origin and significantly represented in m. brunnea. rt-pcr-seq, real-time rt-pcr and transient assay were performed for m. brunnea mbecp10-like gene analysis. our findings imply that expansion and divergence of m. brunnea mbecp10-like proteins are likely associated with plant-pathogen arms race.

RESULTS
a small secreted protein family in m. brunnea
the mbecp <dig> sequence was used to blast against a local database of m. brunnea predicted proteins, which was downloaded from genbank  <cit> . the identity of  <dig> predicted proteins exceeded 30%, with the best hit reaching 44%. despite the low overall similarity, all of them were small proteins with obvious signal peptide sequences, and displayed highly similar n-terminal and c-terminal regions , suggesting the presence of a protein family related to mbecp <dig> in m. brunnea. using the recursive blast search,  <dig> mbecp10-like proteins were found, each with at least one significant blast hit  to another mbecp10-like molecule. the relatedness of a protein family can be illustrated by the pairwise similarity of the protein pairs  <cit> . as shown in figure 1b,  <dig> % pairwise comparisons between any pair of resultant proteins displayed >30% sequence identity ; for any protein, at least  <dig> pairwise comparisons with the other  <dig> proteins showed >30% sequence identity. this set of pairwise relationships defines a fully connected network, indicating that the  <dig> proteins comprise a single protein family. meanwhile, extensive sequence divergence among these related proteins was observed that only  <dig> % of pair sequences with identities exceeding 50% in pairwise comparison .figure  <dig>

beside sequence similarity, these proteins also displayed three obvious common features, indicating that they have a common ancestry:firstly, most of them were small, secreted proteins, with  <dig> members consisting of 187- <dig> aa; only two members had no signal peptide sequence. secondly, these proteins had conserved motifs and cysteines in the same position. next to the signal peptide at the n-terminus, they contained a 14–amino acid motif with a 3–amino acid core consisting of two hydrophobic amino acids and one small molecular amino acid in between. this motif was found in  <dig> members . therefore, we named this motif igy and the mbecp10-like proteins were called igyps . at the c-terminus, a conserved  <dig> amino acid motif was found: qmxip . the two-amino acids ip were the most conserved and the motif was named ip. there was a less conserved motif upstream of the ip motif with the lrfs  sequence, which we named the rf motif. in addition, in the middle and at the c-terminus of most igyps , there were two conserved cysteine residues .

thirdly, the igyp genes shared a similar structure: the open reading frame  regions of most predicted igyps  consisted of three exons. the sizes of the three exons were conserved across the  <dig> igyp genes. the 5′-terminus of the second exon always encoded the c-terminus of the igy motif, and had the most conserved size .

in the genome of m. brunnea,  <dig> genes were predicted as secreted proteins-encoding genes  <cit> , indicating that igyps account for about 17%  of the m. brunnea secretome and suggesting that the igyp family could be pivotal for successful adaption to the ecological niche.

rxlr-deer double-motifs are the host targeting signals for pathogenic oomycete rxlr effectors, which are found at the n-terminus of mature proteins  <cit> . interestingly, the igy and rxlr-deer motifs showed similar features . the n-termini of igy motifs in  <dig> mbigyps  were consistent with the extended rxlr-like motif definition of xx  <cit> . in addition, a total of  <dig> igy motifs showed alkaline n-terminus followed by hydrophobic sequence as found in the rxlr-like motif. moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> igy motifs had acidic c-terminal, with 2- <dig> continuous es  followed by a , similar to the deer motif that neighbors the rxlr motif. the igy motifs were also located at the n-termini of mature proteins with 0- <dig> amino acids from the signal peptides. these similarities between the igy and rxlr-deer motifs suggest igy to be a potential host targeting signal.

mbigypgene models were validated by rt-pcr-seq
rt-pcr-seq is an extremely sensitive method for validating gene models of low-expressed transcripts  <cit> . the predicted gene structures strongly indicate that mbigyps originated from the same ancestral gene. however, the use of regular rt-pcr to confirm these structures with mycelia growing in synthetic liquid medium was inefficient . therefore, we tentatively applied the rt-pcr-seq method to test mbigyps’ gene models with mix samples . samples at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi  were collected and analyzed separately . the rt-pcr primers were placed in the first and third exons, respectively, and forward primers were closely adjacent to the first exon-exon junction  . with respect to seven mbigyps, of which the predicted gene models were not composed of three exons, the primer pairs were chosen at approximate regions by alignments with homologous genes.figure  <dig> 
principle of primer design and bioinformatics workflow. position of primers  designed for validating gene models of mbigyps and sequencing reads  mapped on targeted exons .



rt-pcr-seq yielded  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequencing reads from  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi samples, respectively. a total of  <dig> mbigyps had more than  <dig> sequencing reads spanning the exon-exon junctions. given the high sensitivity of the rt-pcr-seq method,  <dig> mbigyps without reads spanning the exon-exon junctions and  <dig> mbigyps with only one read spanning these junctions  were likely to be inactive pseudogenes. based on sequencing results, we corrected the splicing sites in  <dig> wrongly annotated mbigyp gene models, including seven genes previously predicted with inconsistent gene structures, and found that all tested mbigyps had two introns in sequencing reads for covering regions .

the rt-pcr-seq results validated that most mbigyps  were active during the infection process, further confirming that the mbigyp genes share a consistent gene structure.

because rt-pcr-seq provided deep sequencing at exon-exon junctions, this targeted approach also allowed us to analyze alternative splicing  of mbigyp genes. in the  <dig> exon-exon junctions covered by sequencing reads,  <dig> alternative splicing sites for  <dig> mbigyp genes were found, with each site supported by > <dig> sequencing reads, which accounted for  <dig> % exon-exon junctions of mbigyps, a slightly lower rate than the average  obtained for ascomycota  <cit> . however, considering the highly sensitive method used for testing mbigyps as, these rates could be far below average. from all as events, we only found one exon skipping  event in mbigyp <dig>  the other alternative splicing types were either alternative 5′ splice site  or alternative 3′ splice site  .table  <dig>

in addition, non-canonical splicing sites, including ct-ac, gt-at and gc-ac, were also found in  <dig> and  <dig> dpi samples but not in  <dig> dpi samples, even though these splicing sites were also covered by comparable sequencing reads in pre-infection samples. this result suggested that non-canonical splicing might be related to the fungal infection process .

igyphomologues are patchily distributed in the subkingdom dikarya
in order to identify igyp homologues in other species, we searched the public database using the deduced m. brunnea igyp protein sequences. a total of  <dig> homologous proteins were found from  <dig> fully sequenced fungal species or isolates. interestingly, igyp homologues were not confined to a limited phylogenetic fungal branch, but patchily distributed in  <dig> classes of the subkingdom dikarya, including sordariomycetes , eurotiomycetes , leotiomycetes , and agaricomycetes . unlike m. brunnea, these fungi only had 1- <dig> igyp homologous genes without apparent gene expansion .figure  <dig>

although the  <dig> igyp homologous proteins showed low similarity  with any mbigyps, most of them met the common criteria that define the igyp family of proteins in m. brunnea. first,  <dig> homologous proteins were of small size , and  <dig> had signal peptide sequences. second,  <dig> of them displayed obvious igy motifs immediately adjacent to the signal peptides;  <dig> had conserved qmxip motif in c-terminus, and  <dig> had analogous qxxxp  motifs. rf motifs were not obvious, but in the middle of igyp homologues there was a conserved 5-amino acid kxwxp motif , which was less conserved in the  <dig> mbigyps. mature igyp homologues had 2- <dig> cysteine residues, of which two cysteines in the middle and at c-terminus were conserved . third, the  <dig> homologous genes consisted of three exons, with the third significantly larger than the first two. the igy motifs of  <dig> members were encoded by two exons, and their c-termini were commonly encoded by the 5′-termini of the second exons .figure  <dig> 
consensus sequence pattern of  <dig> igyp homologous proteins from  <dig> fungal species. the consensus sequence pattern was generated with weblogo based on alignment of  <dig> igyp homologous proteins, of which gaps were removed. conserved motifs and cysteine residues were underlined.



figure  <dig> shows a phylogenetic tree constructed by the maximum likelihood method. most nodes had low bootstrap support, which is partially due to limited phylogenetic information obtained from small and highly divergent igyps. phylogenetic information is usually limited in small proteins and could be lost by saturated substitution  <cit> . however, there were still several clades with high bootstrap support, such as igyps from m. brunnea , coprinopsis cinerea  and paracoccidioides spp. , suggesting these proteins diverged recently.

igypshave similar genomic contexts
syntenic groups of homologous sequences can be used to determine the orthology of compared sequences  <cit> . thus, we analyzed the genomic contexts of igyp genes by blast search. we found that the immediately adjacent locus of  <dig> igyps in <dig> fungi encoded a homologous hypothetical protein, which was named igyap <dig>  . the intervals between the igyp and igyap <dig> genes ranged from  <dig> to 3340 bp. using the blastp program to search the ncbi public database, we found that  <dig> igyap <dig> homologous genes  and only  <dig> genes were not adjacent to the igyp loci. in another case, a chitinase c gene  and an unknown protein-encoding gene  were found adjacent to three igyp genes in three fungus species , podospora anserine  and colletotrichum gloeosporioides  . these results indicate significant conservation of the genomic context in some igyp genes across different fungal species. this can be considered as additional evidence supporting a common lineage of some igyps.

ascomycota and basidiomycota diverged from one another at least  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . it is therefore unexpected that small gene clusters, such as igyp and igyap <dig> families exist in both ascomycota and basidiomycota. this can be hardly explained by complicated gene duplication and loss. phylogenetic analysis of igyps revealed that one clade with high bootstrap value  was highly incongruent with the known phylogenetic relationships of species . in addition, independent analysis of igyap <dig> and chic also revealed a similar incongruent phylogenetic relationship between the adjacent neighbors of clade  <dig> igyps . moreover, in clade  <dig>  a degraded transposase gene was found neighboring the igyp-igyap <dig> clusters of beauveria bassiana and pseudogymnoascus destructans as well as the igyp-chic-igyap <dig> clusters of p. anserine and e. pusillum . these results suggest that horizontal gene transfer could be more parsimonious, and constitute the probable explanation for the presence of some igyps along with its neighbors in phylogenetically-distant fungal species.

the igypgenes of m. brunneaare highly expressed in the biotrophic stage
m. brunnea is a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen. upon inoculation of the susceptible poplar clone i- <dig>  no visible symptoms are observed at 0- <dig> dpi. at  <dig> dpi, small chlorotic spots can be found on leaf surfaces. at  <dig> dpi, black spots appear on some chlorotic spots. at  <dig> dpi, the chlorotic and black spots join into small pieces .figure  <dig>

in order to analyze the gene expression patterns of mbigyps during infection, eight active mbigyp genes were selected for real-time rt-pcr experiments. cytotoxic nlp expressions are usually associated with the transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic phase in phytopathogens . we chose two m. brunnea nlp homologous genes , which are homologous to bcnep <dig> and bcnep <dig> of botrytis cinerea
 <cit> , as controls in real-time rt-pcr experiments.

as shown in figure 5b, seven of the eight mbigyp genes had a uniform expression pattern. from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, mbigyp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> maintained low expression levels without significant induction. at  <dig> dpi, these seven genes were induced and their expression peaked at  <dig> dpi, then dramatically declined at  <dig> dpi. in contrast to the other mbigyp genes, mbigyp <dig> was induced in the early days after infection, and its expression peaked at  <dig> dpi. a dramatic decrease of mbigyp <dig> expression was also seen at  <dig> dpi.

on the other hand, two nlp homologous genes showed different expression patterns. both mbnpp <dig> and mbnpp <dig> were induced at  <dig> dpi and their expression levels continued to increase at  <dig> dpi. at  <dig> dpi, their expression levels peaked, and dramatically declined at  <dig> dpi .

because the first visible disease symptoms emerging and mbnpp1/ <dig> expression peaks coincided time wise , m. brunnea might switch from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth at the fifth day after inoculation. thus, all tested mbigyp genes achieving their highest expression levels at  <dig> dpi with a stark decline afterwards suggest that the mbigyp family genes are specifically induced and expressed in the biotrophic stage.

a m. brunneaigyp protein induces cell death in resistant poplar clones
the m. brunnea-resistant hybrid poplar clone nl <dig> is a progeny of p. deltoides i- <dig> and p. euramericana i- <dig>  which are resistant and susceptible clones, respectively  <cit> 
. therefore, the poplar clone nl <dig> was selected for transient assays of mbigyps. as a first step, five different agrobacterium strains  were transformed with the pcambia <dig>  vector carrying a β-glucuronidase  gene with an artificial intron. then, the transformed agrobacterium strains were infiltrated into the tissue cultured plantlets of nl <dig> by the agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration method  <cit> . the results of histochemical gus assays showed that the agrobacterium strain agl <dig> produced significantly more intense gus staining compared with other agrobacterium strains .figure  <dig>

since the majority of known fungal and oomycete effector proteins either function directly in the apoplast or translocate into plant cells using pathogen-independent mechanisms, we started with expressing mbigyps with signal peptides. the  <dig> mbigyp cdnas encoding mature proteins  were fused in-frame to a arabidopsis pr <dig> signal peptide coding sequence  by overlapping pcr; such pcr products were cloned into the gateway-compatible vector ph35gy  to generate expression constructs driven by the camv 35s promoter . the resultant binary vectors were transformed into agrobacterium stain agl <dig>  subsequently, the transformed agrobacterium strains were infiltrated into the tissue cultured plantlets of nl <dig>  exogenous mbigyp expression at 4 days after infiltration  were confirmed by western blotting using anti-gfp antibody and the detected molecular weights  were close to the predicted values  for yfp-fusion proteins . the results of transient assays showed that mbigyp <dig> induced cell death which appeared as discrete tissue desiccation on nl <dig> leaves at  <dig> dai . in contrast, other mbigyps  and the negative control  failed to induce any visible lesions on nl <dig> leaves . p. tomentosa, a non-host of m. brunnea, showed higher expression efficiency than the hybrid poplar nl <dig> . transiently expressing pr1sp-mbigyp13-Δsp-yfp induced necrosis and crinkling of p. tomentosa leaves at  <dig> dai . in contrast, no necrotic responses were observed upon agro-infiltration of any other mbigyps  and the negative control . collectively, these data showed that among the  <dig> tested mbigyps, only mbigyp <dig> induced cell death in poplar, and the cell death response to mbigyp <dig> is likely conserved among several resistant populus species.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified a novel protein family named igyp in the subkingdom dikarya based on five criteria:  similarity of amino acid sequences,  small size proteins with signal peptides,  conserved n-terminal and c-terminal motifs,  conserved gene structure, and  similar genomic context. in total  <dig> proteins were identified as igyps supported by at least three criteria above mentioned. these igyps are scattered across  <dig> classes of ascomycota and basidiomycota, but may have a single origin.

in m. brunnea,  <dig> genes were identified as igyps. in contrast, only 1- <dig> copies of igyp homologues can be observed in other  <dig> fungi. this suggests a large lineage-specific expansion of igyp genes in m. brunnea. in addition, phylogenetic analysis of igyps showed that all mbigyp sequences except for mbigyp <dig> cluster together, formed a species-specific clade in the tree. this large lineage-specific expansion of mbigyp genes is likely the result of recent evolution in m. brunnea. because hemibiotrophic plant pathogens exhibit characteristics of biotrophs in the early stages of infection, avoiding recognition by the plant immune system is essential for early secreted proteins. we speculate that induction of cell death in resistant poplar by a biotrophic stage specific mbigyp could be a failure case of escaping host surveillance; the expansion of these highly divergent mbigyps is possibly associated with plant-pathogen arms race.
