BACKGROUND
plant phenylpropanoids are a group of phenylalanine-derived physiologically active secondary metabolites, such as lignins, flavonols, isoflavonoids, and anthocyanins  <cit> . they perform a vast array of important functions; for example, lignins reinforce specialized cell walls  <cit> , flavonoids and isoflavonoids are involved in uv filtration  <cit>  and symbiotic nitrogen fixation  <cit> , and anthocyanins can protect plants against damaging photo-oxidative effects and uv irradiation  <cit> . phenylpropanoids also have many beneficial functions for human health including anticancer  <cit>  and anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> .

phenylpropanoid biosynthesis starts with the formation of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine. phenylalanine ammonia lyase  catalyzes the phenylalanine into cinnamic acid. cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  and 4-coumarate-coa ligase  then catalyze the conversion of cinnamic acid to p-coumaroyl-coa, which is the precursor for many phenylpropanoid products. anthocyanins, flavonols and isoflaconoids are synthesized from p-coumaroyl-coa through a complex phenylpropanoid pathway .figure  <dig>

lycium chinense, which is a member of the solanaceae family, is a famous traditional chinese herbal medicine that has a large variety of benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> , immunomodulating activity  <cit> , anti-cancer properties  <cit> , ability to reduce blood glucose and lipid levels  <cit> , and anti-aging properties  <cit> . researchers have isolated different secondary metabolites from l. chinense, such as alkaloids  <cit> , carotenoids  <cit> , lignans  <cit> , and betaine  <cit> . partial sequences of specific genes have also been cloned in order to evaluate gene expression during the plant’s development and to investigate the relationship of different genes in various plants  <cit> .

in recent years, next-generation sequencing  technologies such as  <dig> and illumina platforms have been widely used in gene sequencing, most notably, in human genome sequencing  <cit> . compared with traditional gene cloning, ngs technology has high efficiency , fast run times  and high accuracy  <cit> . among the different types of ngs technology, the illumina hiseq system has been widely used , owing to its high throughput, accuracy, and low costs.

the purpose of the current study was to investigate the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway in l. chinense. several full-length cdnas encoding pal, c4h, 4cl, chs, c3h, and comt, and partial-length cdnas encoding chi, f3h, fls, f3’h, and 3gt were identified and isolated. in addition, the relationship between the transcription levels of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes and phenylpropanoid accumulation were analyzed in different organs of l. chinense. to our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize transcriptome sequencing to investigate phenylpropanoid biosynthetic correlative gene expression in different organs of l. chinense.

RESULTS
sequencing and sequence assembly
whole plantlet cdna libraries were sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> system. after cleaning and quality checks, we obtained more than  <dig>  million clean paired-end short reads of  <dig> nt in length following sequencing . the q <dig> percentage , n percentage, and gc percentage were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. to facilitate sequence assembly, these reads were assembled using the trinity program, resulting in  <dig>  contigs with an average contig length of  <dig> nt and an n <dig> of  <dig> nt, ranging from  <dig> nt to > <dig>  nt . furthermore, trinity was used to assemble  <dig>  unigenes with a mean size of  <dig> nt and an n <dig> of  <dig> nt . the unigene size distribution showed the following:  <dig> %  of the unigenes were between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length and  <dig> %  were less than  <dig> nt long;  <dig> %  of contigs were between  <dig> and  <dig> nt, and  <dig> %  were more than  <dig> nt long .table  <dig>

unigene function annotation and pathways
for annotation, the unigenes were further analyzed using blastx, on the national center for biotechnology information  website, against the non- redundant  protein database with a cut-off e-value of 10-5; this resulted in the annotation of  <dig>  unigenes  . the e-value distributions of the unigenes in the nr database showed that  <dig> % of the unigenes had strong similarity , while the remaining  <dig> % of the homologous sequences ranged from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig> . the rates of the similarity distributions showed that  <dig> % of the sequences had a similarity higher than 80%, and  <dig> % of the sequences had a similarity ranging from 19% to 80% . the species distributions for the best match from each sequence are shown in figure 3c. in detail,  <dig> % of the unigenes had the highest homology to genes from vitis vinifera, followed by ricinus communis , populus trichocarpa , glycine max , nicotiana tabacum , solanum lycopersicum , solanum tuberosum .table  <dig>

expression analysis of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes in different organs of l. chinense
the expression of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes was analyzed in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, green fruits, and red fruits of l. chinense by real-time pcr . lcpal, the first enzyme in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, was expressed at the highest levels in the flowers and green fruits, but was moderately expressed in the leaves, roots and red fruits, and only present at low levels in the stems. the expression patterns of lcc4h, lcf3’h, lc3gt, lcc3h, and lccomt were similar, with observably higher expression in the red fruits than in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and green fruits. among the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes of l. chinense, only lc4cl was highly expressed in the roots, with similarly lower levels of expression in the other five organs. lcchs exhibited high expression levels in the red fruits and flowers, but lower levels in the other four organs. lcchi, lcf3h and lcfls were expressed at high levels in the leaves and flowers, at intermediate levels in the green and red fruits, and at very low levels in the roots and stems.figure  <dig>

analysis of phenylpropanoid content in different organs of l. chinense
the same plant materials used for quantitative real-time pcr were used for the hplc analysis of phenylpropanoid accumulation. trans-cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol, and rutin were measured in the different organs of l. chinense . small amounts of trans-cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid were detected in the roots, stems, green fruits, and red fruits. in flowers, all of the identified compounds were very found to be present at high levels. the leaves contained abundant amounts of chlorogenic acid , caffeic acid , and rutin . high amounts of rutin were also found in green fruits , flowers , and stems .figure  <dig>

lcpal, which carries out the first catalysis step in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, was highly expressed in flowers in l. chinense, and the metabolite of this gene, cinnamic acid, was correspondingly the highest in flowers. the gene expression analysis showed that the expression level of lcpal in green fruits was also high; however, the content of its metabolites in green fruits was very low. this is probably owing to the fact that pals are codified by a multigene family in plants  <cit> , suggesting the existence of other pal isoforms in green fruits. in previous study of our laboratory, the expression of c4h in different organs was diverse between different species. in plant allium. sativum, the highest expression level occurred in the root, but in plant agastache. rugosa, arc4h was expressed highest in flowers  <cit> . in l. chinense, we found that the expression levels of lcc4h in red fruits was significantly higher than that that in other organs. lc4cl was highly expressed in root, this result is consistent with our laboratory’s previous study in tartary buckwheat hokkai t <dig>  <cit> . but in l. chinense’s roots, the expression of lc4cl was significantly higher than other organs. in our laboratory’s previous study, they also found two isoform fls genes in tartary buckwheat, and that two fls gene expressions were different in different organs  <cit> . this explains why the expression of the lcfls was inconsistent with that of phenylpropanoid product, kaempferol. to content of kaempferol in l. chinense, it’s much similar with that in buckwheat, highly accumulate in flowers than other organs. we found that the expression levels of lcc4h, lcchs, lcf3’h, lc3gt, lcc3h, and lccomt in red fruits was significantly higher than that in other plant organs but that the levels of the corresponding phenylpropanoids in red fruits was lower. it is well known that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is a very complex process and that multiple enzyme metabolites are produced. moreover, some enzymes exist in many isoforms. therefore, we felt it was not appropriate to relate gene expression and metabolite production absolutely. as shown in figure  <dig>  the content of caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid in different organs has an essentially similar trend, where it is highest in leaves, followed by flowers; lower levels are present in other organs. in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway , caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid are regulated enzymes encoded by the same gene, c3h.

in the current study, the content of chlorogenic acid was found to be very high in leaves . chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol compound found in plants and animals and has many biological functions, including antioxidant  <cit> , anti-stress  <cit> , and antiviral  <cit>  properties. dong et al.  <cit>  investigated the impact of selenium on the content of chlorogenic acid in leaves of l. chinense; the study found that the chlorogenic acid content  in the presence of  <dig>  μg/g sodium selenite was much higher than that in the control plants . therefore, we speculate that there were trace amounts of selenium at the experimental farm from which the l. chinense plants used in this study were derived. the presence of environmental elements, such as selenium, may produce certain effects on other phenylpropanoids  <cit> . in this stdy, we found most phenylpropanoids were accumulate in flowers and leaves, some phenylpropanoids such as kaempferol and rutin also have high accumulate in stems and green fruits,but the content of phenylpropanoids were lowest in roots and red fruits. nowadays, most consumer purchase fresh or dry red fruits as part of diet. as a reault, we suggest consumer to use other parts of l. chinense to maximize the health benefits of phenylpropanoids.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a rapid and cost-effective method for transcriptome analysis of lycium chinense using illumina sequencing technology. using the annotation, we found many transcripts that encode for putative genes that are involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. but not all genes were found, that mostly because the sample which used for rna sequencing was not the stage that all genes were expressed. to extensively study the genes related the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, we have plan to use other tissues of l.chinense for rna sequencing in future. we also compared gene expression in different organs. we noticed that most phenylproanoid genes were highly expressed in the leaves, flowers, and red fruits. our compound analysis indicated that a number of phenylpropanoids were present in the leaves and flowers of l. chinense, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and rutin.
