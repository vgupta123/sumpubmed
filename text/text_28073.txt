BACKGROUND
rhipicephalus  microplus, the tropical/southern cattle tick, is a livestock ectoparasite which has negatively impacted the cattle industry throughout the world. this tick is a vector for the pathogenic organisms which cause bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis. moreover, heavy tick loads reduce cattle productivity and irreparably damage hides. annual economic losses attributable to r. microplus infestations have been estimated in brazil and australia to be approximately $ <dig> billion  <cit>  and over $ <dig> million  <cit> , respectively. the cattle tick was a serious pest in the u. s. with estimated losses to the u. s. cattle industry of over $ <dig> million in the early 1900s, equivalent to approximately $ <dig> billion in  <dig> dollars  <cit> . an aggressive control program led to the eradication of the cattle tick from the u. s. however, r. microplus has developed resistance to almost all of the chemical classes available for control programs and novel control technologies are desperately needed by producers and tick eradication programs in countries where eradication has not been possible. also, it is imperative that cattle producers in the u. s. be proactive in preventing the very real possibility of the tick's re-establishment.

driven by the need for novel r. microplus control approaches, molecular studies have been initiated in laboratories in several countries. rosario-cruz et al.  <cit>  reported a survey of r. microplus tick populations in mexico to determine the molecular mechanism of resistance to pyrethroid acaricides. lew-tabor et al.  <cit>  comprehensively analyzed events in the r. microplus transcriptome during tick attachment and development, identifying specific transcripts associated with these activities. kurscheid et al.  <cit>  characterized the rnai pathway in r. microplus and identified  <dig> rnai-related proteins. canales et al.  <cit>  evaluated vaccination with a boophilus tick protein for effectiveness as a control strategy in response to boophilus tick infestations. additionally, genomic databases and other resources have been developed which provide the foundation for a r. microplus genome sequencing project. for example, ullmann et al.  <cit> , using reassociation kinetics techniques, estimated the size of the genome at  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp. wang et al.  <cit>  reported comparative studies of a r. microplus est database  which then consisted of  <dig>  unique transcripts assembled from over  <dig>  expressed sequence tags . guerrero and nene  <cit>  analyzed a r. microplus bac library and this library was subsequently used in chromosome studies to investigate genome organization in the cattle tick  <cit> . r. microplus microarrays have been developed and utilized in studies of acaricide-inducible gene expression  <cit>  and in profiling gene expression induced by infection of r. microplus with babesia bovis . additionally, the genome sequencing project for the black-legged tick, ixodes scapularis, has been completed . the first i. scapularis gene set was released in december  <dig> by vectorbase and genbank and is available for downloading and browsing from the ixodes genome project data page at vectorbase.

the large size of the r. microplus genome and its highly repetitive nature has precluded whole genome sequencing project with present technologies and costs. to date, r. microplus sequencing efforts to date have largely focused on acquisition of ests from various tissues and lifestages. however, est sequencing provides information only on the coding regions expressed in a given tissue or set of tissues. other reduced-representation sequencing techniques must be employed to obtain low-copy sequence regions  missed by est approaches  <cit> . in this regard, cot filtration was reported to be an effective protocol to include when exploring the gene space of large genome species. for example, sequencing wheat genomic dna libraries prepared after cot filtration resulted in a three-fold reduction in repetitive dna and a >13-fold enrichment in genes compared to data from non-filtered genomic dna  <cit> . the wheat genome is over twice the size of the genome of r. microplus  <cit>  and contains over 85% repeat sequences  <cit> . to test the utility of cot filtration in exploring the r. microplus genome, we used reassociation kinetics to filter cattle tick genomic dna and sequenced six flow cells of the resulting cot-filtered product using  <dig> flx pyrosequencing. the  <dig> ×  <dig> nucleotides of sequence generated was assembled into a database of contigs and singletons and the contigs analyzed by blast. in order to gather sequence information on the r. microplus genome structure with a more traditional approach, we also selected five bac clones which were sequenced to closure. two clones were selected at random and three were selected by hybridization to known cdnas of interest.

RESULTS
bac clone sequencing and annotation
as part of the first steps for the development of resources for complete genome sequencing and analysis of the tick r. microplus, a bac library containing large insert sizes  was constructed. the library consists of  <dig>  clones, providing ~ <dig>  x coverage of the r. microplus genome. to acquire basic knowledge about the genome structure of r. microplus and to identify entire gene coding regions for specific genes of interest from the tick, we selected five bacs for complete sequencing. bacs 77-j <dig> and 74-f <dig> were selected at random, bac 129-n <dig> was selected based on its hybridization to a probe from a pyrethroid-metabolizing carboxylesterase , while bacs 66-m <dig> and 77-g <dig> were selected based on hybridization to a mixed probe containing equal amounts of cdnas encoding a putative cyp <dig> cytochrome p <dig> family member  <cit>  and a putative acetylcholinesterase ache <dig>  <cit> . after sequencing and assembly to closure, the bac clone insert sizes were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  bp for clones 66-m <dig>  74-f <dig>  77-g <dig>  77-j <dig>  and 129-n <dig>  respectively. the annotation of the open reading frames predicted in the bac sequences was conducted using genscan. the coding region for czest <dig> , the cdna sequence for the cytochrome p <dig> , and the coding region for ache <dig>  provided guides for bac annotation. figure  <dig> shows a diagram of each bac with regions of significant sequence similarity to known sequences and direction of transcription indicated by arrows. additional files  <dig> and  <dig> provide the complete results from the genscan analysis.

the randomly selected bac 74-f <dig> did not contain any protein coding sequences other than the gag retroviral fragment which appeared to be a full length hit to the gag coding region  and  <dig> regions of similarity to partial fragments of an endonuclease/reverse transcriptase . the other randomly selected bac, 77-j <dig>  had  <dig> regions of sequence similarity to parts of regions coding for pol or gag retroviral sequences and one region with similarity to the full length coding region for an i. scapularis hypothetical protein . the lack of known tick expressed gene coding regions and the abundance of retroviral sequences from these two randomly selected bacs suggests a rather low tick expressed gene density in the r. microplus genome. in addition to the low known tick gene content in the two randomly selected bacs, all five bacs contained a significant level of repeats and transposons. the functionality of these transposons is not known, however, nearly full length hits to the gag-pol polyprotein nucleotide sequence were found on bacs 77-g <dig> and 74-f <dig> . the microsatellite repeats  identified in these bacs include n, n, n, n, n and n . nucmer analysis  also was consistent with a highly repetitive genome. these findings are in general agreement with the previous estimation that as much as 70% of the r. microplus genome may be repetitive  <cit> . also, van zee et al.  <cit>  reported a ~ <dig> bp repeat element in the ixodes scapularis genome which is estimated to occur over  <dig> million times in that tick's genome. highly repetitive genomes present difficulties in sequencing and assembly steps of whole genome sequencing projects. in fact, the highly repetitive nature of the r. microplus genome presented problems in the sequencing and contig assembly of a bac not reported in this study, but selected on the basis of its similarity to a ggy protein domain-containing gene .

the three bacs selected with specific probes were targeted because of our interest in identifying molecular mechanisms of resistance to acaricides; the esterase and cytochrome p <dig> family of enzymes are known to be involved in acaricide resistance in r. microplus, though information on specific genes involved remains limited. the bac selected with the czest <dig> probe, 129-n <dig>  contains eight regions with sequence similarity to genbank entries. three of these were gag- or pol-like retroviral sequences, one was similar to rnase h/integrase, while two were similar to hypothetical proteins. the entire gene coding region of czest <dig> was found in 129-n <dig> as were sequences with similarity to a zinc finger protein. only the czest <dig> and branchiostoma floridae hypothetical protein hits appeared to be full length .

bacs 66-m <dig> and 77-g <dig> were both selected with the p450/ache <dig> mixed probe and each contained two genscan predicted copies of protein coding regions with sequence similarity to the r. microplus cyp <dig> cytochrome p <dig> reported by crampton et al.  <cit>  . the p <dig> genes comprise a very large gene family of enzymes that are present in most organisms and which function in many oxidative detoxification pathways, often in mechanisms whereby arthropods develop pesticide resistance  <cit> . we were interested in sequencing genomic dna corresponding to the cyp 41-like tc <dig> from bmigi version  <dig>  crampton et al.  <cit>  described cyp <dig> as most similar to p <dig> families which metabolize compounds such as pesticides, and guerrero et al.  <cit>  found that expression of the transcript that corresponded to tc <dig> was very abundant in an organophosphate resistant strain of r. microplus compared to an organophosphate susceptible strain. additionally, the susceptible strain responded to organophosphate application by reducing the relative expression of tc <dig> transcript compared to overall gene expression, while the resistant strain responded to organophosphate by increasing relative expression of tc <dig>  thus, the discovery of these bacs with cytochrome p450-like sequences will be very helpful to our studies of metabolism-based acaricide resistance genes. bac 77-g <dig> appears to contain the full length cyp41-like sequence and a downstream tandemly-arranged partial copy which encodes the n-terminal part of the cyp41-like protein . interestingly, the two cyp41-like copies in bac 66-m <dig> are arranged in a head-on fashion , transcribed from different strands of the genomic dna. it is possible the bac assembly incorrectly oriented the sequences corresponding to fig 1a hit iv because the genscan analysis discovered this region coded for the c-terminal region of cyp <dig>  while the figure 1a hit v sequence coded for the n-terminal and middle areas of cyp <dig> .

a dot plot analysis  of the five sequenced bacs shows that repetitive dna is quite common in these bacs. the most striking aspect of the plot is the highly repetitive nature of the randomly selected bac 74-f <dig> with tandemly arrayed repetitive features prevalent through most of the bac, visualized in the comparison to self. interestingly, the other randomly selected bac, 77-j <dig>  did not have many matches to self, in fact, far fewer matches to self than the other random bac or the three bacs which were selected based on their gene coding regions. the pattern of matches arranged in linear fashion in the cross-bac comparisons is another striking feature of the dot plot, indicating how common tandemly arranged repetitive elements are in this tick's genome. in particular, the comparisons of random bac 74-f <dig> to both 66-m <dig> and 129-n <dig> show numerous tandemly arrayed matches. in contrast, the other random bac, 77-j <dig>  which has six significant hits to genbank entries , contains less dot plot matches in the cross-bac comparisons than any other bac. this bac contains at least three significant genbank hits to retroviral genes  and perhaps the dissimilarity between these retroviral genes and the tick dna from the other bacs is responsible for the lower number of cross-bac matches in 77-j <dig> compared to the other four bacs. the long match at the 3' end of the cytochrome p450-containing bac 77-g <dig> when compared to the other cytochrome p450-containing bac's end, 66-m <dig>  shows the two sequences are related but inverted. this is consistent with the assembled sequencing results which showed a cytochrome p450-like sequence at the ends of both bacs, although the transcription direction was in the opposite directions .

 <dig> pyrosequencing of cot fractionated genomic dna
given the size and the extent of the repeat content of the r. microplus genome, the cot fractionation strategy was chosen to facilitate the generation of sequence information from the gene-containing regions of the genome. cot fractionation was performed as previously described to enrich for single/low-copy sequences  <cit> , processing the cot-fractionated dna for  <dig> sequencing. this included generating dsdna with the klenow fragment of dna polymerase i and random 9-mers, then blunt-ending the reaction products with mung bean nuclease. six  <dig> runs were completed using the flx machine producing an average read length of  <dig> nt. table  <dig> shows a summary of each  <dig> run, presenting number of reads and nucleotides, average read length, and number of non-redundant sequences. the total output from the  <dig> runs was  <dig> , <dig> reads corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides. table  <dig> shows the newbler assembly data summary. the  <dig> , <dig> reads assembled into  <dig>  large contigs, considered contigs of over  <dig> nt, making up a total of  <dig> , <dig> nt, or ~1% of the nt from the overall  <dig> dataset. the average size of the large contig dataset was  <dig> nt and the largest contig was  <dig>  nt. about 31% of the total reads remained as singletons, reads which did not assemble with any other read. around 60% of the reads either totally or partially assembled. the total number of all contigs was  <dig>  which contained  <dig> , <dig> nt or ~18% of all nts. thus, a large part of the nucleotides did not assemble into contigs. in fact, we found that approximately 49% of the  <dig> sequence reads were redundant to this assembly and did not provide new sequence information. we also used blat analysis and determined that  <dig> of the  <dig>  large contigs mapped at >95% identity to  <dig> members of bmigi version  <dig>  . interestingly, the remaining large contigs were all found to contain potential open reading frames > <dig> bp and genescan analysis identified genes/exons in  <dig>  of these contigs .

to further the utility of our  <dig> data, we sought to re-assemble the data with existing tick sequences, most of which were from bmigi. the  <dig> , <dig> non-redundant sequences were used to create an assembled sequence dataset using the members of bmigi version  <dig>  gene index as seed sequences in an attempt to extend the bmigi entries, particularly in the 5' direction. it has been found that the bmigi entries are often lacking in n-terminal encoding nucleotides or the 5' untranslated regions. also, since the bmigi database was assembled from ests, 5' gene promoter regions and sequences downstream from the polyadenylated 3' end are absent. it was thought these deficiencies could be partially addressed by sequencing the cot-selected genomic dna fraction and reassembling bmigi. the most current bmigi dataset, version  <dig>  http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=b_microplus, contains  <dig>  members with a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp. following reassembly with the cot-selected  <dig> sequencing data, we were able to extend the length of  <dig>  bmigi members, resulting in a total dataset of  <dig> , <dig> bp. the bmigi version  <dig>  sequences extended by this analysis are listed in additional file  <dig> titled "bmigi cotdna extension ids.xls". these sequences can be viewed at http://ccg.murdoch.edu.au/gbrowse/cgi-bin/gbrowse/tickbase/. they are also available in additional file  <dig> titled "bmigi cotdna extension sequences.doc". the  <dig>  bp extension of the bmigi dataset was only a  <dig> % increase. figure  <dig> shows that the approximately half of the extended bmigi members were only extended from 1- <dig> bp. however, there were approximately  <dig> members which were extended in each of the three categories of 51- <dig> nucleotides, 101- <dig>  and 151- <dig>  these extensions correspond to potentially up to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids. there were also over  <dig> bmigi entries which were extended between 201- <dig> bp. although on a percentage basis, the extended bmigi database does not seem much different from the original dataset, this new information would be very useful in cases where n-terminal amino acids are necessary, such as when designing full-length gene coding regions for expression studies. one interesting point from table  <dig> is that the newbler assembly classified  <dig>   reads as repeats. since the genome analysis by ullmann et al.  <cit>  indicated that around 70% of the r. microplus genome is repetitive, the cot selection has reduced the repetitive content 10-fold.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the cot-filtration approach provided a valuable intermediate dataset that bridges the gap between focused est sequencing and whole genome sequencing. our cot-filtered dna  <dig> sequencing allowed us to add from 50- <dig> bp onto  <dig>  members of our preexisting bmigi version  <dig>  est database of  <dig>  unique sequences. this corresponds to potentially 16- <dig> new amino acids added to the extended bmigi members. further bioinformatic analysis is required to identify promoter and intronic sequences in the cot-filtered dna dataset. this would include utilizing the i. scapularis genome sequence to align our dataset contigs and help identify genome components and elements such as putative exon/intron boundaries, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, promoters, transcription factor binding elements, regions of synteny, among others. the  <dig> sequencing dataset from our study is available from genbank and it is hoped this dataset will provide a resource for genome studies of r. microplus specifically and ticks in general.
