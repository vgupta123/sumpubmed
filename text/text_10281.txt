BACKGROUND
aspergilli represents a very important group of cell factories in industrial biotechnology, in particular for the production of industrial enzymes since their high capacity for efficiently secreting both homologous and heterologous proteins allows for cost-competitive production  <cit> . compared to other microbial cell factories such as escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergilli has a far more complex post-translational modification  system, which is usually regarded as the bottleneck for protein secretion  <cit> . one of the most widely used aspergilli is the koji mold a. oryzae, which due to its long history in soy and rice-based food productions easily obtained the gras status  <cit> . the fungus produces various industrial enzymes, including amylases, proteases, phytases and lipases etc., representing a market value exceeding  <dig> million usd. compared to its extensive industrial applications little is known about its protein secretory machinery. with the whole genome being sequenced in  <dig>  it has become possible to investigate the protein secretory machinery of a. oryzae at the molecular level  <cit> . however, hindered by its physiological characteristics, e.g. being multinucleate and lacking a sexual life cycle, experimental manipulations on a. oryzae is rather difficult compared to other simpler microorganisms, and therefore many of the open reading frames  in the genome are still described as hypothetical genes of unknown functions. according to the statistics from the aspergillus genome database   <cit> , only  <dig> of the total  <dig>  predicted orfs have been experimentally verified as of april  <dig>   <dig> 

protein secretion is one of the most complex and important processes in eukaryotes which carries out two main tasks: i) performing proper folding and post translational modifications  such as glycosylation and sulfation and ii) sorting cargo proteins to their functional states and final cellular localizations. secretory components are the proteins handling different processes along the secretory pathway. recently feizi et al. has constructed a genome-scale model for the protein secretory machinery in s. cerevisiae, a model fungus to study many cellular functions including protein secretion  <cit> .  <dig> core components involved in the yeast secretory machinery were identified and classified into  <dig> subsystems based on the processes they involve  <cit> . the subsystems include translocation, dolichol biosynthesis, er  glycosylation, folding, gpi  biosynthesis, gpi transfer, eradc , eradl , eradm , cop ii , copi, golgi processing, ldsv , hdsv , cpy  pathway and alp  pathway  <cit> .

here we define the functional protein secretory component list of a. oryzae using the secretory model of s. cerevisiae as a scaffold. the list was further adapted to filamentous fungi by adding a. oryzae orthologs of the secretory components reported in other aspergillus species such as a. nidulans and a. niger. since amylase production shares resources with other proteins that also perform ptms on the secretory pathway, in addition to monitor how the secretory components response, we also checked how the fungal secretome was altered in response to amylase overproduction. this analysis has not only provided experimental evidence for the identified secretory components, but also enabled us to understand the secretory machinery in response to high-level protein secretion.

RESULTS
identification of a. oryzae secretory components
comparing with a. oryzae, the genome and the secretory machinery of s. cerevisiae is better characterized, and therefore, although less complex, we could still, make use of the yeast secretory pathway to identify and construct an analogous protein secretory pathway of a. oryzae using a comparative genomics approach. through homology search ,  <dig> a. oryzae orfs were mapped to the yeast secretory components with identify over 80% .  <dig> diverged potential homologs were found through iterative psi-blast search with significant e-values < <dig>   <cit> . to complement and accomplish the a. oryzae component list, we also included the machinery components previously reported in a. oryzae <cit>  and blasted for the a. oryzae homologs of the reported components in a. nidulans <cit>  and a. niger <cit> , as being in the same genus they share many common mechanisms and pathways. as a result,  <dig> a. oryzae secretory components by wang et al. <cit> ,  <dig> a. oryzae components by kuratsu et al. <cit>  and  <dig> components based on blast search  with the a. niger components reported in oliveira et al. <cit>  were added. components appeared redundantly in different resources were excluded, and hereby a total of  <dig> a. oryzae genes  were included in our a. oryzae secretory component list, making it the most complete list so far for tracing the a. oryzae secretory machinery. additional file  <dig> illustrates the workflow of detecting the a. oryzae secretory components, and detailed information can be found in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

mapping the a. oryzae secretome to go-slim terms
besides the α-amylase that was overexpressed, there are a large amount of native proteins performing diverse functions that need to pass through, and thereby compete for the resources in the secretory machinery. it would therefore be informative to monitor how these proteins respond to amylase overproduction. most of these secretory proteins contain a n-terminal signal peptide as the key feature to enable their targeting and being processed via the secretory machinery  <cit> . in uniprot, only  <dig> out of  <dig>  a. oryzae proteins were predicted to have signal peptides . this number is unrealistically low as yeast  has been annotated to have secretome sizes varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes  <cit> . due to its larger genome size and more efficient secretion capacity, a. oryzae is expected to have many more proteins passing through the secretory pathway. therefore we used the fungal secretome database   <cit>  to define the a. oryzae secretome as it applies various algorithms  to predict the clients on the secretory pathway. as a result,  <dig> genes were identified to code for secretory clients according to fsd. these genes were further mapped to the a. oryzae go slim terms under the aspect “component” using aspgd classification . the majority  of the genes fall into the “cellular_component_unknown” group followed by “nucleus”  and “membrane” . only  <dig> % of genes are allocated to “extracellular region”, reflecting the fact that only a fraction of the proteins containing signal peptides are destined for the extracellular space  <cit> . other proteins containing signal peptides may reside in the cytosol , the er , the golgi , cell wall , plasma membrane  and elsewhere. the actual genes destined for the extracellular and plasma membrane may vary as many membrane proteins do not have n-terminal signal peptides as they use internal signals to integrate into the er membrane  <cit>  and some of the proteins without signal peptides potentially use unconventional secretory pathways  <cit> .

construction of recombinant α-amylase over-producing strains of a. oryzae
in order to trace the secretory machinery response we constructed two novel a. oryzae α-amylase over-producing strains cf <dig> and a <dig>  together with an earlier reported high-level producer of α-amylase   <cit> , their performances were compared with the reference strain   <cit> , which produces basal level of amylase.

multiple gene copies are frequently found to improve protein production  <cit> , even though increasing copy numbers does not necessarily raise expression due to reasons such as saturation of transcription factors or pleiotropic effects of random integrations  <cit> . regulation of protein expression mainly occurs on the transcriptional level. here we relied on the endogenous transcription factors and applied two starch inducible promoters for expressing the taka amylase. the previous higher α-amylase producer cf <dig>  contains additional copies of the taka amylase gene driven by taka promoter  <cit>  compared to the reference strain a <dig>  <cit> . to construct strains with even higher α-amylase production, one approach was to transform the reference strain a <dig> with the taka amylase gene under the a. niger na <dig> promoter  <cit> , which has shown better effects on protein expression than the taka promoter  <cit> . strain a <dig> was therefore constructed by transforming plasmid plf <dig> harboring the taka amylase gene under the na <dig> promoter into a <dig> and selecting for higher producing clones. another approach was to insert more copies of the taka amylase gene under the taka promoter into strain cf <dig>  which already has elevated protein expression. strain cf <dig> was constructed following this strategy by transforming plasmid plf <dig>  which has the α-amylase gene under the taka promoter, into strain cf <dig>  .

strain characterization in batch cultivations
the four strains were characterized in batch fermentations with maltose as carbon source as it is known to induce both promoters. key kinetic variables were extracted from measurements of the sugar and biomass concentrations together with the enzymatic activity. the profiles of amylase production and cell growth  are shown in figure  <dig>  the specific growth rate , the average α-amylase yield on biomass , the average α-amylase productivity on biomass  and the final α-amylase titer  are shown in figure  <dig>  it is observed that the wild type strain a <dig> grew the fastest indicated by the highest μmax of  <dig>  h− <dig>  and the fastest consumption of maltose and glucose before 18 hours . in contrast, strain cf <dig> grew the slowest, indicated by the μmax of  <dig>  h− <dig> and completed consumption of maltose and glucose after 30 hours. strain cf <dig>  and a <dig> had moderate specific growth rates of  <dig>  h− <dig> and  <dig>  h− <dig>  respectively, corresponding to a maltose depletion at  <dig> and 24 hours, respectively. the average α-amylase yields at the time points where the maximum dry cell weights were reached were calculated by the α-amylase titers at that time point divided by the biomass produced. this data provides a measure of the relative production of secreted protein per unit of cell produced. if the number is high, it indicates that the cells are allocating resources towards α-amylase production and secretion rather than producing cellular proteins and other biomass components. the reference strain a <dig> had the lowest yield , followed by cf <dig>  , with a <dig>  and cf <dig>  having the highest yields. the maximum α-amylase titer in the fermentations showed similar trend as the average protein yield, being lowest for a <dig> , followed by cf <dig>  , and with the highest final titer for a <dig>  and cf <dig>  . in consideration of the time span for reaching the maximum average yield, strain a <dig> showed the highest specific productivity with  <dig>  mg/gdcw/h followed by cf <dig>  , cf <dig>  and finally the reference a <dig> . this indicates that a <dig> stand out as the best production strain among the four as it has a high specific productivity, a high final titer and an acceptable specific growth rate.

global transcriptional response to α-amylase over-production
in order to investigate the effect of α-amylase over production on the secretory pathway as well as on the whole cell metabolism we performed transcriptome analysis in the late exponential growth phase during batch fermentations. after normalization and statistical analysis we found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes to be differentially  expressed when comparing a <dig>  cf <dig>  and cf <dig> to a <dig>  even though many differentially expressed genes have unknown functions due to poor annotations of the a. oryzae genome, we performed reporter go-term analysis  <cit>  using the go-term classification from aspgd where  <dig> genes are classified into gene ontology terms. shown in figure  <dig>  many genes with go-term annotations related to protein secretion are significantly up-regulated in all three comparisons, including protein n-linked glycosylation, er translocation and folding, signal peptide processing, er to golgi and the retrograde golgi to er vesicle trafficking etc. other secretory related go terms also appeared but in a strain dependent manner, e.g. response to unfolded protein only significant in cf <dig>  and cf <dig> versus a <dig>  several amino acid biosynthesis related go terms are found down-regulated, in either three comparisons  or strain specific manner  which might be due to the slower growth at the sampling time or the feedback inhibition on amino acid biosynthesis from overloaded er stress. down-regulation of amino acid biosynthesis has been observed in yeast in hac <dig> deletion strain overproducing heterologous proteins  <cit> . the unfolded protein response  in the recombinant a. oryzae strains may not be efficient enough to cope with the overloaded amylase and thus rendered similar consequence as in the hac <dig> deletion yeast strain that has impaired upr. the transcriptional profiles of all the genes are described in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

transcriptional response of the a. oryzae secretory machinery
in order to get a detailed mechanistic picture of the protein secretion response at the molecular level we mapped the gene transcriptional profiles to the reconstructed a. oryzae secretory machinery. with the most complete secretory component list, we were able to monitor the transcriptional response of the secretory machinery to the ultimate extend.

in line with the global transcriptional response , the volcano plot in figure 5a shows that the machinery components in all three strains have similar transcriptional responses to α-amylase overproduction . the transcriptional changes of all the machinery components are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig> components were found significantly changed  in all three comparisons , among which  <dig> were up-regulated, and  <dig> were down-regulated. the transcriptional profiles of the significantly changed genes in all three strains are described in figure  <dig> based on their classifications in the defined subsystems.

the taka amylase from a. oryzae contains one n-linked glycosylation site and four disulphide bonds  <cit> . clearly, in comparison with the reference strain a <dig>  the subsystems responsible for the α-amylase ptms, especially the components involved in er processing  were significantly up-regulated, particularly in the cf <dig> strain which had the slowest growth compared to the other strains. only two genes that are homologs of yeast ola <dig> and cpr1/ <dig> were down-regulated.

 <dig> out of the  <dig> significantly changed a. oryzae secretory components were identified through blast search based on the yeast secretory machinery components  <cit>  and have never been identified in a. oryzae from other studies. these novel a. oryzae secretory components are homologs to yeast erd <dig> , yos <dig> , jem <dig> , mns <dig>  and gab <dig>  all of which showed significant up-regulation in response to α-amylase overproduction.

erd2p mediates retrieval of the er resident proteins from the golgi through binding of the erd2p receptor to the c-terminal peptide sequence hedl on soluble er resident proteins such as proteins encoded by kar <dig>  pdi <dig>  ero <dig>  fkb <dig> and many more in yeast  <cit> . er retrieval meditated by erd2p has been suggested as an non-essential process as ire1p was reported to share functional redundancy to maintain normal levels of er residential proteins in yeast  <cit> . the transcriptional levels of the a. oryzae ire <dig> homolog were not changed in all three amylase overproducing strains compared to the wild type which may indicate that a. oryzae has a different mechanism to retrieve er residential proteins than yeast, and the a. oryzae erd <dig> homolog seems to play a more important role than the ire <dig> homolog.

ire1p is also well known to splice the hac <dig> mrna which once transcribed will trigger the upr to alleviate folding stress in the er  <cit> . genes encoding folding chaperones such as a. oryzae homologs of cne <dig>  kar <dig>  pdi <dig>  mpd <dig>  fkp <dig> and the kar2’s co-chaperones scj <dig> and jem <dig> were all significantly up-regulated, reflecting that the upr was actively turned on in all strains compared with the wild type. however, both the mrna levels of the hac <dig> homolog and the ire <dig> homolog were not differentially changed indicating that the ire1-mediated hac <dig> splicing is not the only mechanism for activating upr in a. oryzae. actually, an ire1-independent surveillance mechanism that monitors protein folding in the er has been indicated in yeast  <cit>  and in metazoan cells. there are already three mechanistically distinct pathways, mediated by ire <dig>  atf <dig> and perk respectively, known to operate in parallel to activate upr in mammalians  <cit> . a study overexpressing membrane protein in a. niger showed the mrna level of bipa  was elevated while no truncated haca transcript was detected  <cit> . with transcriptomic data on genes encoding a. oryzae homologs of hac <dig>  ire <dig> and the upr activated er chaperones, our analysis further implied that the ire1-mediated hac <dig> splicing is not the sole mechanism for activating upr in a. oryzae and it may share the ire1-independent mechanism with yeast, metazoan or mammalian.

another interesting observation is that some of the yeast components were mapped to more than one a. oryzae orfs whose transcriptional level can differ significantly. for example, three a. oryzae homologs were found for yeast cpr <dig>  with ao <dig> significantly up-regulated in three comparisons, ao <dig> significantly down-regulated, and ao <dig> not changed; der <dig> homolog ao <dig> significantly up-regulated in three comparisons while no change was found for ao090701000551; erd <dig> homolog ao <dig> significantly up-regulated while no change was found for ao <dig>  homologs of the same yeast gene can also behave similarly, as for those of the folding chaperone erj <dig>  ao <dig> and ao <dig> were both significantly up-regulated in the three comparisons. these phenomena reflect that the secretory machinery components are duplicated in a. oryzae. the increased number of components might be associated with more sophisticated functions or regulations in the a. oryzae secretory pathway than in yeast.

we did not see significant transcriptional changes on post er processes, which suggest that they might be more regulated on protein level or they are regulated on transcription level but to a much lesser extent.

transcriptional response of the secretome to amylase overproduction
the transcriptional response of the secretome to a specific recombinant protein is important in a sense that if the target protein overloads the secretory machinery, the cell probably needs to change its secretome profile to adapt to the processing capacity of the secretory machinery. to examine this idea we compared the expression profiles of our defined secretome of a. oryzae in response to amylase overproduction in the three recombinant strains compared to the wild type a <dig> .  <dig> out of the  <dig> putative genes in the predicted secretome were significantly changed, with  <dig> genes found in all three comparisons,  <dig> genes found uniquely in cf <dig> and  <dig> genes found uniquely in a <dig> . we performed reporter go-term analysis  <cit>  using the go-slim classification based on component  for the  <dig> secretome genes that have a localization annotation in aspgd .

according to the go-slim enrichment analysis, genes encoding secretory proteins localized to the er, the golgi apparatus, the cytoplasm and the membranes were distinctively up-regulated in all three comparisons, most of which have been identified as a. oryzae secretory components . several additional genes such as ao <dig> , ao <dig>  and ao <dig>  were also detected in these localizations showing significant up-regulation.

genes encoding proteins secreted to the extracellular region, the vacuole, the cell wall were either significantly up- or down- regulated which may be informative for further investigation. interestingly, two genes predicted to reside in the fungal cell wall namely ao <dig>  and ao <dig>  were significantly up-regulated in all three strains. egld is a putative endoglucanase discovered in the conidial cell wall of a. nidulans carrying an expansin like domain  <cit> . expansins exhibit wall loosening activity and are involved in plant cell expansion and other developmental events. the expansins are highly conserved among plants and fungi  <cit> . egld in a. nidulans has been indicated to be involved in fungal cell wall remodeling during germination  <cit> . the significant up-regulation of its a. oryzae homolog ao <dig> in the amylase overproduction strains might be the consequence of amylase overloading to the secretory pathway. remodeling of the cell wall through egld up-regulation may possibly help to loose cell wall structure and facilitate amylase secretion. there is no direct explanation for the up-regulation of the mannoprotein cwpa, however, since the surface properties of fungi are primarily determined by the presence of cell wall mannoproteins  <cit> , the expression of cwpa may also be altered in response to egld up-regulation to facilitate the remodeling of the fungal cell wall and ultimately the protein secretion.

transcriptional down-regulation on glaa encoded glucoamylase  has been reported in a. niger in response to er stress induced by dtt  <cit> . two a. niger and a. nidulans glaa/glab homologs ao <dig> and ao <dig> were also found down-regulated in strain a <dig> and cf <dig> that supposed to have higher er stress due to higher amylase yields and slower growths than cf <dig> . both taka-amylase and glucoamylase expressions are regulated by amyr which activates their transcriptions in the presence of starch or maltose  <cit> . the glucoamylases may therefore serve as competitors to taka-amylase for not only transcription factors but also for secretory machinery. other genes that have an extracellular region localization such as ao <dig> , ao <dig> , ao <dig>  and ao <dig>  were all down-regulated in three comparisons. as also extracellular enzymes these gene products may very likely go through the same secretory pathway as the taka-amylase  <cit> . to efficiently utilize nutrient and cellular resources, the cells may slow down the expression of the competitor genes and divergent resources to synthesize and secrete the taka-amylase enforced for overexpression. as exemptions, genes ao <dig>  and ao <dig>  encoding alpha-glucosidase  were significantly up-regulated especially in a <dig> and cf <dig>  since this enzyme directly hydrolyzes maltose to glucose, the up-regulation of the genes should be the cellular response to digest the carbon source maltose.

isoenzymes performing analogous functions might be regulated differently according to their localizations. for example, more than one  <dig>  2-alpha-mannosidases  were found in a. oryzae. ao <dig> encoding protein has a predicted extracellular localization and thus its transcription was down-regulated to leave resources for taka-amylase. in contrast, ao <dig> encoded protein is important for performing n-glycosylation and folding in the er and thus the gene was significantly up-regulated. ao <dig> did not have a transcriptional change and its localization is unclear.

co-expression analysis of genes changed uniquely in cf32-a <dig> and a16-a <dig> comparisons
a <dig> and cf <dig> grew relatively slower than cf <dig> , while they had higher amylase yields and final titers . in order to look into the strain-specific responses of these two strains, we performed clustering analysis for i) the genes that were significantly changed in expression in the a <dig> vs. a <dig> but not in any other comparisons and ii) the genes that change significantly when comparing cf <dig> vs. a <dig> but not in any other comparisons . the genes changed uniquely in the comparison of a <dig> vs. a <dig> was grouped into  <dig> clusters, where the genes in cluster  <dig> were up-regulated and the genes in cluster  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated compared to a <dig> . from the down-regulated gene clusters we identified three sequence motifs that are enriched in the upstream regions of the genes in the clusters.  <dig> sites contain aagaa,  <dig> sites contain cccct, and  <dig> sites contain actacta, which are consensus binding sites for yeast transcription factors azf1p, msn2p/msn4p, and smp1p respectively. msn2p/msn4p and smp1p are known stress response regulators in s. cerevisiae <cit> . the down-regulation of the genes regulated by them might indicate that the a <dig> strain has less cellular stress compared with the other strains, which could be one of the reasons for its better performance. the genes changed uniquely in the comparison of cf <dig> vs. a <dig> were grouped into  <dig> clusters where clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contain up-regulated genes and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> contain down-regulated genes . go-term over-representation using a hypergeometric test for the genes in the up-regulated clusters showed that these genes have dna-binding and catalytic functions, which could be explained by the higher amylase copy numbers in the cf <dig> strain as it may request for higher transcriptional efficiency. motif aaaagaaaa, binding site of yeast azf1p, was also identified in the down-regulated clusters. based on the azf1p functions in s. cerevisae, similar roles as to activate transcription of genes involved in growth and carbon metabolism or in maintenance of cell wall integrity could be expected. the down-regulation of these genes indicated certain changes happened in these facets in response to amylase overproduction. the genes belonging to different clusters and the identified putative sequence motifs on the upstream regions are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, by providing a far more complete secretory component list of a. oryzae we were able to monitor the whole secretory pathway in response to α-amylase overproductions at the molecular level. the roles of many predicted secretory machinery components were verified with their transcriptional changes. the defined a. oryzae component list offers a better platform to trace the secretory machinery responses on genome , transcriptome, and proteome levels. from this analysis we could discuss several interesting mechanisms based on the transcriptomic data of the identified components, such as the erd <dig> mediated retrieval of the er residential proteins may be more dominant in a. oryzae than in yeast and there could be an ire1-independent system to trigger the upr response in a. oryzae.

additionally, this study generated a list of targets for genetic manipulation. for example, overexpressing the up-regulated egld and cwpa encoded cell wall proteins, and knocking out the genes encoding extracellular proteins competing for the secretory pathway may help to increase protein secretion in this industrially important fungus.
