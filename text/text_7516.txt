BACKGROUND
comparative genomics studies show that genome rearrangement events often occur between two genomes. genome rearrangement events play important role in speciation. the rearrangement operations include deletions, insertions, inversion, transposition, block interchange, translocation, fission and fusion, etc. here we study the mechanism for inversion events via core-genome scaffold comparison of different strains within the same species.

by comparing two genomes, we can find candidate rearrangement operations. however, the set of rearrangement operations to transform one genome into the other is not unique in many cases. computing the rearrangement operations between two genomes under different assumptions is an active area, where intensive research have been conducted  <cit> . it is reported that breakpoints appear more often in repeated regions  <cit> . a summary of the where and wherefore of evolutionary breakpoints is given by sankoff  <cit> . the prevalence of short inversions has been studied  <cit> . ranz et al. analyzed the breakpoint regions of the  <dig> inversions that differentiate the chromosomes of drosophila melanogaster and two closely related species,d. simulans and d. yakuba, and reconstructed the molecular events that underlie their origin  <cit> . rajaraman et al. suggested that rearrangements could be driven by the iss and the positions of the inversion breakpoints in their study were also highly correlated with is :  <dig> of the  <dig> mapped breakpoints were close  to some predicted is, whereas this number drops to  <dig> for uniformly sampled random coordinates   <cit> . darmon and leach reviewed many examples of prokaryotic genomic rearrangements which were induced by natural transposable elements and pointed out that recombination between irs can result in an inversion of the internal dna sequence  <cit> . the association between ir and genome rearrangement breakpoints was also reported in previous studies on mammals and drosophila genomes . armengol et al. observed that nine primary regions involved in human genomic disorders which show changes in the order or the orientation of mouse/human synteny segments were often flanked by segmental duplications in the human sequence  <cit> . they also found that 53% of all evolutionary rearrangement breakpoints associate with segmental duplications, as compared with 18% expected in a random location of breaks along the chromosome .

pevzner and tesler found extensive breakpoint reuse for inversion events in mammalian evolution when comparing human and mouse genomic sequences . statistics analyzes showed that breakpoints are often associated with repetitive elements and the density of breakpoints in small intergenes appears significantly higher than in gene deserts  <cit> . recently, breakpoint reuse for inversions has been reported in drosophila genus  <cit>  as well as saccharomyces pastorianus  <cit> .

it is well known that recombination  of homologous or non-homologous dnas can lead to various genetic variations including inversions, transpositions, insertions/deletions, and will leave some direct or inverted repeats on both ends, and existing repeats can further promote more variations.

to study the rearrangement operations, comparison of different individuals/strains within the same species  can be more helpful since strains within the same species are conserved. a pan-genome, or supra-genome, describes the full complement of genes in a clade , which can have large variation in gene content among closely related strains. pan-genomes were first studied by tettelin more than a decade ago  <cit> . several tools have been developed for pan-genome analysis. for example, get_homologues  <cit>  is a customizable and detailed pan-genome analysis platform. blast atlas  <cit>  visualizes which genes from the reference genome are present in other genomes. mugsy-annotator  <cit>  identifies syntenic orthologs and evaluates annotation quality using multiple whole genome alignments. characterization of the core and accessory genomes of pseudomonas aeruginosa has been done by ozer et al.  <cit> . for pan-genome analysis, genomes from different strains of the same species are decomposed to core blocks , dispensable blocks  and strain-specific blocks . here we extend the pan-genome analysis by comparing the core-genome scaffolds of different strains of the same species.

we study two types of bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, and investigate the inversion events among different strains of the same species. we find an interesting phenomenon that long  inversion regions are flanked by pairs of inverted repeats  which are often insertion sequences . this mechanism also explains why the breakpoint reuses for inversion events happen. we study the prevalence of the phenomenon and find that it is a major mechanism for inversions. the other observation is that for different rearrangement events such as transposition and inverted block interchange, the two ends of the swapped regions are also associated with repeats so that after the rearrangement operations the two ends of the swapped regions remain unchanged. to our knowledge, this is the first time such a phenomenon is reported for transposition event.

methods
we develop a pipeline to generate the core-genome blocks, dispensable blocks and strain-specific blocks based on the multiple sequence alignment produced by mugsy  <cit> .

we then develop a computer program to generate the scaffolds of the strains from the core-genome blocks by repeatedly merging two consecutive blocks appearing in all the strains of the same species. in this way, the number of distinct blocks in the core-genome scaffold is reduced dramatically. for example, for pseudomonas aeruginosa, before merging, there are  <dig> blocks in the core genome of the  <dig> strains. after merging, the scaffolds contain  <dig> blocks.

after that, we compute the inversion distance between two scaffolds. computing the inversion distance between two scaffolds is a very hard and complicated combinatorial problem. several algorithms have been developed. due to the difficulty of algorithm design, most of the algorithms only consider inversion events. however, a transposition/block-interchange event can be represented as  <dig> inversion events, and an inverted transposition/block-interchange event can be represented as  <dig> inversion events. therefore, some of the computed inversion events may not be real. there are algorithms dealing with inversion and other rearrangement events such as block interchanges simultaneously. however, the weights for different events are different . thus, those algorithms still suffer from the problem of outputting inversions that are not real.

our strategy here is to eliminate some obvious  transposition, inverted transposition, block interchange, and inverted block interchange events before computing the inversion distance between two scaffolds.

for simplicity, we always assume that g

k− <dig> as in the definition of a general transposition, a pre-process allows us to merge two consecutive blocks if they are consecutive in both input genomes. thus, we can still handle some cases for swapping two consecutive regions. for example, the genome +1+2+6+7+3+4+5+ <dig> becomes +1+2+4+3+ <dig> after merging +6+ <dig> and +3+4+ <dig>  and re-number + <dig> as + <dig> in the new representation. an independent transposition can change +1+2+4+3+ <dig> into +1+2+3+4+ <dig>  in terms of breakpoint graph, the two blocks π

after eliminating independent transposition, inverted transposition, block interchange and inverted block interchange events, we use grimm-synteny  <cit>  to compute the inversion distance between pairwise core-genome scaffolds. we only seriously consider the cases where the rearrangement distance is small. when the rearrangement distance is large, there may be multiple solutions for the inversion history. thus, in this case, the computed inversion events may not be real.

finally, we developed a pipeline to compare sequences at the two ends of each inversion region to see whether a pair of inverted repeats exists. once the inverted repeats are found, the pipeline can also search all the strains and mark down its positions in different strains.

we computed the pairwise inversion distance between scaffolds after eliminating other kinds of independent rearrangement events such as transpositions, inverted-transpositions, block-interchanges, and inverted-block-interchanges. for each of the  <dig> scaffolds, we chose a scaffold with the minimum inversion distance  to compare. the purpose was to compare two scaffolds with a small number of inversions so that we can observed real inversions between them. from table  <dig>  it can be seen that group  <dig> is the closest group to all the other groups except for group  <dig>  the closest group to group  <dig> is group  <dig>  where the inversion distance is  <dig>

in total, there are  <dig> inversion events among the  <dig> distinct pairs of scaffolds . among the  <dig> inversion regions,  <dig> of them are flanked by a pair of irs. the remaining  <dig> inversions with no irs found at the two ends of the inversion regions are very short and their lengths are from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. for each of the first three  inversions, the lengths of the inversion regions are more than  <dig> mbp, and we find a pair of irs  at the two ends of each of the three long inversion regions. for the pair of groups  <dig> and  <dig>  there are three inversions and the lengths of the three inversions in the core-genome are  <dig>  mbp,  <dig>  mbp, and  <dig>  kbp, respectively. interestingly, we find a repeat b that appears four times in both scaffold  <dig> and scaffold  <dig>  where b appear as −b once and as +b three times in scaffold  <dig>  the four occurrences of b form a pair of irs at the two ends of each of the  <dig> inversion regions . for groups  <dig> and  <dig>  there exist two independent transpositions and one inverted transposition . after eliminating the three independent rearrangement events, there are  <dig> inversions between groups  <dig> and  <dig> which are calculated by grimm-synteny  and only one inversion  is flanked by a pair of irs . note that both − <dig> and − <dig> appear twice in scaffold  <dig>  we remove the green blocks in fig.  <dig> in our comparison. among these seven inversions, only one inversion  is longer than  <dig> bp and flanked by a pair of irs . group  <dig> can be obtained from group  <dig> with one independent transposition. a repeat +r appears three times at the ends of the two blocks involved in the transposition. see fig. 3). those occurrences of +r play an important role in the transposition and the details will be discussed in the transposition section. for group  <dig> and  <dig>  there exist two independent transpositions and two independent inverted transpositions . after eliminating the four independent rearrangement events, the scaffolds for group  <dig> and  <dig> are actually the same and the inversion distance between them is zero. again, both blocks  <dig> and block  <dig> appear twice in group  <dig>  . we remove the green blocks in fig.  <dig> in our comparison.

for the first inversion between group  <dig> and  <dig>  there are  <dig> strains in group  <dig> and  <dig> strains in group  <dig>  all the strains in group  <dig> and group  <dig> contain repeat +a and −a as shown in fig.  <dig>  the physical positions as well as the lengths of the repeats differ slightly in different strains. see additional file 1: table s5a. thus, the inversion  between scaffold  <dig> and scaffold  <dig>  is found between the 13× <dig> pairs of strains in these two groups. for the remaining inversions listed in table  <dig>  the physical positions, the lengths of repeats and core-genome blocks  in different strains are given in additional file 1: tables s5b-e.

in summary, three different pairs of irs are found and we use +a/-a, +b/-b and +o/-o to differentiate these three pairs. we also find three copies of +r in comparison of groups  <dig> and  <dig>  the locations of these repeats in the scaffolds are shown in fig.  <dig>  the lengths , gene products and protein ids  of these repeats are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

breakpoint reuse
the three inversion steps from scaffold  <dig> to  <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  where it can be seen that there is a +b and three -bs in scaffold  <dig>  the three inversion events are -b-6+b to -b6+b, +b7∽64-b to +b-64∽-7-b and +b-64-b to +b64-b and the breakpoint the black arrow points at in fig.  <dig> is used three times.
fig.  <dig> three inversion steps from scaffold  <dig> to scaffold  <dig>  the breakpoint between - <dig> and  <dig> in scaffold  <dig> is used three times. see the black arrow





here +b plays a crucial role in the three inversions and is used three times, each time +b and -b form a pair of inverted repeats at the two ends of the inversion regions. now let us have a close look at +b , we can see that for the first inversion , the real cutting points  are at the left end of -b and the right end of +b, while for the other two inversions , the real cutting points  are at the left end of +b and the right end of -b. here the real cutting point does not seem to be important and the repetitive element b should be viewed as the breakpoint.

another interesting finding is that for groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each scaffold contains a -a and three +as.  theoretically, this -a can be reused three times with each of the three +as. however, we did not observe such three breakpoint reuses in a single pairwise scaffold comparison. but it has been observed that this -a, along with each of the three +as, mediate three different inversion events which occur between group  <dig> and group  <dig>  group  <dig> and group  <dig>  and group  <dig> and group  <dig>  respectively .

after computing pairwise inversion distance among the  <dig> scaffolds, we selected a scaffold with minimum inversion distance for each of the  <dig> scaffolds as shown in table  <dig> for comparison. from table  <dig>  it can be seen that group  <dig> is the closest group to all the other  <dig> groups with inversion distances ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the closest group to group  <dig> is group  <dig>  where the sign of block  <dig> is different.

in total, there are  <dig> inversion events among the  <dig> distinct pairs in table  <dig>  and the inversion region lengths varies from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp.  among the  <dig> inversion regions,  <dig> of them are found to be flanked by a pair of inverted repeats in the strains of the source groups. for inversion  between group  <dig> and group  <dig>  and the four inversions between group  <dig> and  <dig>  no pairs of inverted repeats are found at the two ends of the block. the length of inversion   is short . the four computed inversions between groups  <dig> and  <dig> may not be true since there are another  <dig> other rearrangement events between the two scaffolds . for groups  <dig> and  <dig>  the rearrangement distance is five . see table  <dig>  at the breakpoints of this inverted block interchange, we also find irs and we will discuss it later in the inverted block interchange section. for group  <dig> and  <dig>  after eliminating six independent transpositions, there exists a sequence of four inversions . only one of these four inversions is flanked by a pair of irs. we observe that there are seven copies of block  <dig> in group  <dig> and we used the - <dig> next to - <dig> for comparison. the distance between group  <dig> and group  <dig> is big  and thus our predicted rearrangement history between group  <dig> and group  <dig> may not be correct.  to obtain group  <dig> from group  <dig>  an independent inverted transposition and an inversion  are required. . the inverted region  is flanked by a pair of irs  in the group  <dig>   in addition, we find that this inverted transposition event is also associated with repeats and we will discuss this later in the “inverted transposition” section.

for all the inversions listed in table  <dig>  the physical positions, the lengths of repeats and core-genome blocks  in different strains are given in additional file 1: table s7a-g.

we find a total of  <dig> different types of pairs of inverted repeats and use letters from +d/-d to +m/-m, +s/-s and +q/-q to label and differentiate these  <dig> pairs of irs. the locations of these irs in the scaffolds are shown in fig.  <dig>  the lengths , gene products and protein ids  of these  <dig> irs are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  we note that  <dig> of these  <dig> pairs of irs contain genes which encode transposase.

breakpoint reuse
the three inversion steps from scaffolds  <dig> to  <dig> are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  from fig.  <dig>  it can be seen that the breakpoint between  <dig> and  <dig> in scaffold  <dig> is used twice. the corresponding inversion regions are flanked by -l and +l.
fig.  <dig> three inversions between scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  the breakpoint between  <dig> and  <dig> in scaffold  <dig> is used twice. see the black arrow





it is worth pointing out that the two +ms in scaffold  <dig> form a pair of directed repeats . after inversion , the pair of directed repeats  of m becomes a pair of inverted repeats. this means that a pair of drs has the potential to mediate inversions.

inverted block interchange
we find an inverted block interchange between scaffold  <dig> and  <dig> and we use fig.  <dig> to illustrate. in fig.  <dig>  region +e-27∽-20+s and –s13∽-11-e in scaffold  <dig> are inversely interchanged with each other to obtained scaffold  <dig>  the existence of two pairs of irs  makes sure the two ends of the swapped blocks remain unchanged after the inverted block interchange event. the physical positions of +e/-e, +s/-s and blocks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in groups  <dig> and  <dig> are listed in additional file 1: table s7h.
fig.  <dig> inverted block interchange of region -27∽- <dig> and region -13∽- <dig> between scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  +e/-e and +s/-s are two pairs of irs. the steps from scaffold  <dig> to the middle scaffold are omitted




the other explanation is that an inverted block interchange can be replaced by two inversions. figure  <dig> shows the two inversions which can replace the inverted block interchange of blocks -27∽- <dig> and block -13∽- <dig>  each of these two inversions is flanked by a pair of irs .

inverted transpositionfig.  <dig> inverted transposition of region 16∽ <dig> and block  <dig> between scaffold  <dig> and  <dig>  there are three occurrences of repeat q with different signs. from scaffold  <dig> to the next scaffold, there is an inversion of block  <dig> which are flanked by +f and -f




the other explanation is that the inverted transposition can be replaced by two inversions: the first inversion is from blocks  <dig> to - <dig> and the second inversion is from blocks - <dig> to - <dig> . both of these two inversions are flanked by a pair of irs .

discussion
for both pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli strains, irs were found at the two ends of long sequence inversions. the two ends of the inversion remained unchanged before and after the inversion event. we also observed that other rearrangement operations such as transposition, inverted transposition, and inverted block interchange, had repeats  at the ends of each segment, where the ends remained unchanged before and after the rearrangement operations. this suggests that the conservation of ends could possibly be a popular phenomenon in many types of chromosome rearrangement events. past studies reveal that insertions and deletions  can be mediated by directed repeats   <cit> . sequences flanked by a pair of drs can be deleted from a chromosome and the resulting chromosomes keeps only one copy of the dr. sequences flanked by a pair of drs can also be inserted into a chromosome at the location containing one copy of the dr. in both case, the ends of the indels remain unchanged  <cit> . however, indels can also be caused by activities of mobile dna elements such as transposons and integrons, where conservation of ends does not hold  <cit> .

the mechanism for breakpoint reuse is also interesting. the fact that long inversions are flanked by a pair of inverted repetitive elements can clearly explain why breakpoint reuse happens for inversions. our observations show that the breakpoint reuse is actually the repeated segment reuse. the breakpoints at the nucleotides level for the reused repeat differ depending on the repeat is at the left or right end of the inversion.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have studied the rearrangement events for both pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli strains. we have found that repeats were at the ends of different kinds of rearrangement events including inversion, transposition, inverted transposition, and inverted block interchange. in many cases, these repeats keep the ends of rearrangement events unchanged. this suggests that the conservation of ends could possibly be a popular phenomenon in many types of chromosome rearrangement events.
