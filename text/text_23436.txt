BACKGROUND
magnaporthe grisea is the causal agent of rice blast disease, which occurs as outbreaks in all rice-growing regions. it is estimated that 10–30% of the annual rice harvest is lost due to this disease, which is enough to feed  <dig> million people  <cit> . therefore, it is extremely important for us to better understand this fungus and to find an effective way to control it. m. grisea has become the principal model organism for studying the molecular basis of fungal diseases in plants because of the genetic and molecular tractability of both the fungus and rice  <cit> .

one of the basic characteristics of biological organization is that everything in an organism can be regarded as part of a complex network  <cit> . traditional researches rely on a single gene or protein alone and therefore do not provide a complete understanding of the biological processes. as in vivo elementary molecular components, proteins perform their functional roles through their interactions with one another. thus, developing a protein-protein interaction  network can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular processes  <cit> . in the past few years, high-throughput methods have been implemented to identify ppis  <cit> . using these experimental methods, such as yeast two-hybrid screens, ppi networks for a series of model organisms were determined that allow us to understand the function of proteins at the level of systems biology. unfortunately, none of these high-throughput methods has been applied to the rice blast fungus, despite its importance  <cit> . the genome sequence of m. grisea was released in  <dig>  <cit> , offering the first instance of the gene inventory required by a pathogenic fungus to cause plant disease. compared with the available genomic information, the ppi data for m. grisea are limited. therefore, a ppi network of m. grisea is urgently required to direct our further investigation of this fungus.

in parallel with the large-scale experimental determination of ppi, many ppi prediction methods were also developed. these methods are based on diverse attributes, concepts, or data types, such as interolog  <cit> , gene expression profiles  <cit> , gene ontology  annotations  <cit> , domain interactions  <cit> , co-evolution  <cit> , and structural information  <cit> . some machine learning methods, such as support vector machines , have also been used to predict ppis  <cit> .

among the above-mentioned computational methods, the interolog approach has been widely implemented  <cit>  and has proved to be reliable for predicting ppi from model organisms  <cit> . the core idea of the interolog approach is that many ppis are conserved in different organisms  <cit> . based on this approach, the first draft of a human ppi map was generated  <cit> . continuously accumulated ppi data from model organisms as well as advances in detecting orthologous proteins in different organisms  <cit>  have made the interolog method an increasingly powerful tool for constructing ppi maps for entire proteomes.

using the interolog method,  <dig>  ppis among  <dig>  m. grisea proteins were inferred from the experimental ppi data in different organisms. although the predicted ppi network covers approximately only one-fourth of the m. grisea proteome and may still contain many false-positives, it is the first ppi network for this pathogen and will provide a framework for the future study of rice blast fungus biology.

RESULTS
generation of a m. grisea ppi map
with the assistance of the inparanoid algorithm  <cit>  in identifying true orthologs between m. grisea and other organisms, the combined ppi data from e. coli, s. cerevisae, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, and h. sapiens were used to infer the ppi network of m. grisea. in this work,  <dig>  interactions among  <dig>  m. grisea proteins were obtained . approximately two-thirds of the interactions can be directly inferred from the ppi data of yeast .

a considering some ppis can be inferred from two or more organisms, the total number of predicted ppis is  <dig> .

since the false-positive rate of the current large-scale experimental ppi data is quite high  <cit> , the ppis based on the interolog method will inevitably contain a large proportion of false-positives. two strategies were utilized to increase the confidence level of the predicted data. first, we used a stringent algorithm  to distinguish true orthologs from out-paralogs  <cit> . second, we used only the ppi data collected in the dip  <cit>  and hprd  <cit>  databases, which are manually curated and hence are of higher quality than other databases available to the community.

network validation
due to the absence of large-scale experimental ppi data in m. grisea, we had no direct method of assessing the overall quality of the predicted network. using the go annotations, the domain interaction database , and the gene expression profiles, three computational analyses were carried out to evaluate the global quality of the predicted ppis indirectly. the procedures involved, including the preparation of datasets and the construction of randomized networks, are detailed in the methods section.

the reliability of the entire network was first assessed by a method used in a previous study  <cit> . the main idea of this method is that two interacting proteins would be expected to have similar or related functions. therefore, ppi datasets with high confidence should predict a greater proportion of interactions between functionally related proteins than those with low confidence. recently, the m. grisea genome annotation team at north carolina state university released the go annotation dataset of m. grisea, which is based on experimental data and stringent computational approaches. the go annotations of  <dig>  proteins in m. grisea are available, covering  <dig>  proteins and  <dig>  non-self interactions in our predicted ppi network. since a pair of interacting proteins generally have related but not identical functions, they should have some but not all of their go annotations in common. to evaluate the network, we compared the proportion of the interactions that shared at least one go term in any of the three go categories in the predicted and  <dig>  randomized networks. since the go annotations offer a hierarchical description of gene functions, in which deeper go terms indicate more precise functions, comparisons were performed at different levels of the go hierarchy . it was found that the percentage of ppi pairs sharing go terms in the predicted ppi network was consistently higher than the largest percentage in the  <dig>  randomized networks , suggesting that the predicted ppi network preferentially connects proteins sharing go terms at any level of the go hierarchy .

the second validation method relies on the assistance of the ipfam database. by collecting binary interacting pfam domain pairs generated through protein three-dimensional structural data, the ipfam database is independent of the large-scale ppi data in model organisms. the ipfam database has previously been employed to predict ppis  <cit> , but it was used here as a reference database to validate our predicted network. the central idea for such a validation is that high-confidence ppi networks should contain a greater proportion of interactions associated with pfam domain interacting pairs. the corresponding pfam domains for  <dig>  proteins in the predicted network were annotated, and there are  <dig>  predicted ppis among these  <dig>  proteins. of these  <dig>  ppis,  <dig> are associated with pfam interacting domain pairs; however, in the  <dig>  randomized networks, the average number of ppis associated with pfam interacting domain pairs is  <dig> ±  <dig> . the largest number of ppis associated with pfam interacting domain pairs is only  <dig>  which is significantly smaller than that of our predicted network .

the third method was applied to further complement the validation of the predicted ppi data. because interacting proteins tend to have correlated gene expression profiles  <cit> , this property has also been used to predict or validate protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in our predicted network,  <dig>  proteins have the corresponding gene expression profiles deposited in the m. grisea microarray dataset from the geo database  <cit> . actually,  <dig>  non-self ppis were predicted among these  <dig>  proteins. the average absolute value of the pearson correlation coefficients  between the expression data of any interacting pair was  <dig> . all the average absolute pcc values among the  <dig>  randomized networks  are smaller than that of the predicted ppi network, which means that the predicted interacting pairs prefer to connect genes with correlated expression profiles .

it is important to note that the three validation methods above are somewhat indirect ways to evaluate the predicted ppis and may still contain some drawbacks. for instance, because more than half of the go annotations of m. grisea were transferred from model organisms, a certain bias inevitably exists in the first validation method. even so, these three methods together provide convincing evidence that the confidence of the predicted ppi network is significantly higher than that of randomized networks. therefore, we argue that the overall quality of the predicted ppis is good.

validation of each predicted interaction
while the above analysis has shown the overall quality of the predicted interactions, it is also very important to evaluate the reliability for each predicted ppi. in this work two p-values based on go terms and the expression correlation for each predicted interaction were proposed to assess the reliability of each predicted interaction. the underlying null model is that of randomized networks. in the randomized networks, the number of shared go terms and the expression correlation coefficient  for each predicted interaction were calculated. based on such null distributions of go terms and expression correlation, two nominal p-values can be determined for each predicted interaction. more details about the calculation of p-values are available in the methods section.

the calculated p-values allow us to determine which of the predicted ppis are likely to be products of random processes and which are more likely to be reliable. generally, predicted ppis with lower p-values should have higher reliability. of the  <dig>  predicted ppis,  <dig>  interactions were found to have go terms-based p-values ≤  <dig> , while  <dig> interactions were found to have expression correlation-based p-values ≤  <dig> . since proteins sharing similar functions and proteins with almost identical expression profiles do not necessarily interact with each other, the go terms and expression correlation are not really gold standards for evaluating the reliability of predicted interactions. in other words, a nominal p-value of  <dig>  may not indicate that the predicted ppi should have a false-positive rate of  <dig> .

in addition to the above two p-values, a prediction score s was assigned for each predicted interaction. based on the inparanoid score, the score s mainly reflects the orthologous relationship between the predicted interacting proteins and their corresponding experimentally validated interacting proteins  in model organisms. more details about the definition of s are addressed in the methods section. generally, a prediction with a higher s tends to be more reliable. although we are not able to quantify the level of the score s that enables us to consider an interaction reliable, the score s can be used as a complementary measure to evaluate the reliability of a predicted interaction. in additional file  <dig>  we list the two nominal p-values and the prediction score s for each predicted interaction. we also annotate each interaction with its pfam interacting domain pair  and indicate from which organisms the inference came. taken together, these measures provide an overall impression on the reliability of each predicted interaction.

network properties
the network properties are presented in table  <dig>  in our network,  <dig> of the  <dig>  proteins have degrees higher than 40; these proteins are called hubs in the network. some of these hubs may be the proteins encoded by essential genes in m. grisea. yeast orthologs for  <dig> of the  <dig> hub proteins were reported to be essential genes . since these  <dig> hub proteins usually perform important cellular functions, they can be a valuable resource for studying this pathogen. for instance, some of them may be selected as anti-fungus drug targets. compared with the established ppi networks in some other organisms, our network generally has a larger diameter and a smaller clustering coefficient  <cit> , implying that our network is somewhat loosely connected; however, compared with  <dig>  randomized ppi networks with the same degree distribution , our network has a larger clustering coefficient, which means local cohesiveness exists in the predicted ppi network, and clusters representing biological complexes or pathways may be detected  <cit> . considering that the current network is far from complete, these parameters reflect only the limited ppi data in our network. as the availability of experimental ppi data increases in the future, the detailed parameters of these network properties will be changed. even so, the so-called 'scale-free' topology can be more or less observed in our network . scale-free networks typically have many nodes with few links and only a few highly connected ones, which have been frequently observed in the ppi networks of other organisms. in contrast to a random network, in which the connectivity distribution obeys a poisson distribution, in a scale-free network the probability p of nodes having k edges decays as a power law, p ≈ k-γ. we plotted the connectivity distribution on a double logarithmic scale to identify the most reliable linear fit for the data, characteristic of a scale-free topology . the established network in m. grisea is approximately characterized by a power law, where p ≈ k- <dig>  .

a the randomized network was generated by keeping the degree distribution constant and randomizing the number of edges of the predicted network. briefly, we first randomly allocated the number of edges for each node according to the degree distribution of the predicted network. subsequently, we randomly picked a pair of nodes to make an edge, then decrease the degree for both nodes by one until the expected edges has been assigned to each node . this process was repeated  <dig>  times, and the average values and standard deviations of the corresponding network properties are shown.

pathogenicity genes in the network
pathogenicity genes play key roles during the fungal infection process. a fungus will lose all or part of its pathogenicity when a pathogenicity gene is knocked out. previous work has demonstrated that the diverse functions of pathogenicity genes have no preferential enrichment in any go category, in comparison with the analysis of all genes in m. grisea  <cit> . of the  <dig> pathogenicity genes collected from the phi-base website and the recently published work of lee and co-workers  <cit> , only  <dig> pathogenicity proteins can be found in the established network . the average degree of these  <dig> pathogenicity proteins is  <dig> , which is higher than that of the whole network . the pathogenicity genes uncovered by lee and co-workers were based on a high-throughput phenotype screening, and they may need further experimental validation. for comparison, the pathogenicity genes deposited in the phi-base were verified by individual experiments and share a higher confidence level. considering only the pathogenicity proteins from the phi-base, the average degree is  <dig> , which is much higher than that of the whole network . therefore, it seems that the pathogenicity proteins tend to have higher degrees.

in the interolog method, the number of interacting partners predicted for a m. grisea protein is related to the number of orthologs this protein has in the five model organisms. we analyzed the number of orthologs of all  <dig>  proteins in the predicted network and found that the average number of orthologs of the  <dig> pathogenicity proteins is  <dig> , which is higher than that of all  <dig>  proteins . we further observed that the average number of orthologs of pathogenicity proteins from the phi-base is  <dig> , which is higher than the average number of all  <dig>  proteins . although neither of these facts is statistically significant, we are unable to fully rule out the argument that the higher connectivity of pathogenicity proteins may be a result of the larger number of orthologs they have in the five model organisms.

researchers investigating an interactome have frequently used the number of interacting partners of a protein as an important parameter reflecting the protein's cellular function. for instance, there is increasing evidence for a correlation between the evolutionary conservation of a protein and the number of its interacting partners  <cit> . it is well accepted that proteins that participate in more interactions are phenotypically more important for the organism  <cit> . it has also been observed that the toxicity-modulating proteins in s. cerevisiae are involved in a larger number of interactions  <cit> . additionally, human cancer proteins have been reported to have far more interacting partners than other human proteins  <cit> . it is shown here that the increased connectivity of pathogenicity proteins may indicate their special biological roles in the pathogen.

in order to understand the cellular function of a protein on a systems level, it is increasingly important to study the network or functional module involved. it has been proved that clustering methods are good at identifying ppis that take place within the same pathways or complexes  <cit> . using identified clusters  in a network, we can predict the functions of proteins within the clusters  <cit> . using the k-clique clustering method  <cit> , we detected some clusters with pathogenicity genes . recent studies have shown that human disease genes can be predicted based on the human ppi data, because mutations in different members of a protein complex can often lead to similar diseases  <cit> . likewise, mutations in different members of a protein complex may lead to similar pathogenicity phenotypes. therefore, new pathogenicity genes are likely to be found within these clusters.

the identified clusters in figure  <dig> allow us a glimpse of the functional diversity of pathogenicity genes. the go enrichments in these identified clusters include ion transport, chromatin silencing, rna processing, and phosphorus metabolic processes . the potential biological impact of these clusters is exemplified in one cluster with a go enrichment of phosphorus metabolic processes. interestingly, in this cluster two pathogenicity proteins, pmk <dig> and osm <dig>  were predicted to have an interaction and were also found to be tightly connected with pbs <dig> and mst <dig>  all four of these proteins are protein kinases. it has been established that the mst11-mst7-pmk <dig> cascade regulates the appressorium formation and infectious growth of m. grisea, and this pathway might have crosstalk with the other two mapk cascades   <cit> . unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions among the three pathways are not yet clear. the cluster presented here may provide some hints on the crosstalk between the mst11-mst7-pmk <dig> and osm <dig> cascades.

the pathogenicity of m. grisea is complicated, and it is necessary to consider it a network  <cit> . furthermore, the pathogenicity proteins in the network together with their interacting partners are compiled into a subnet in which most of the pathogenicity proteins are connected into one major component . this so-called pathogenicity protein network may provide a clue to understanding the pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus at a systems level. taken together, the clusters identified above and the pathogenicity protein network will be helpful for the study of fungal pathogenesis and the identification of new pathogenicity genes in the rice blast fungus.

secreted proteins in the network
the secreted proteome is a crucial component reflecting the ability of fungi to perceive and respond to the environment. the genome of m. grisea contains a large number of secreted proteins, which play important roles in the attachment to and the colonization within plant tissues  <cit> . of the  <dig>  secreted proteins predicted by the signalp program  <cit> ,  <dig> are included in our network . all of the secreted proteins have degrees less than  <dig> and the average degree is only  <dig> , which is significantly smaller than that of the whole network . as secreted proteins are secreted out of cells, it is reasonable to expect them to have low connectivity in the network.

some of these secreted proteins may be secreted into the rice tissue and interact with rice proteins  <cit> . it can be hypothesized that this group of secreted proteins have a much lower degree in the m. grisea protein network. we further analyzed the  <dig> predicted secreted proteins using wolfpsort  <cit>  and found that  <dig> proteins were not predicted to be located outside of the cell of m. grisea. in other words, these  <dig> proteins may be secreted into host cells and interact with host proteins . the average degree of these  <dig> proteins in the established network is only  <dig> , in accordance with our hypothesis . furthermore, these  <dig> secreted proteins, together with their interacting partners, were compiled into a subnet of secreted proteins in m. grisea  to facilitate further study of the host-pathogen interactions between m. grisea and rice.

the secreted proteins' orthologs in the five model organisms were also counted. the average number of orthologs of the  <dig> secreted proteins in our network was observed to be  <dig> , which is smaller than that of all the proteins in the predicted network . furthermore, we found that the average number of orthologs of the  <dig> secreted proteins that may interact with rice proteins is  <dig> , which is also slightly smaller than that of all the proteins in the predicted network . therefore, we cannot fully rule out the argument that the lower connectivity of secreted proteins may be a result of the generally smaller number of orthologs they have in the five model organisms.

utility
the predicted data can be accessed on the mpid website . users can input a protein's broad accession number, and a table listing the predicted interacting partners of the query protein is returned . this table provides the nominal p-values, the prediction scores, the corresponding go annotations, and the swiss-prot homologs for interacting proteins. users can also view an image generated by graphviz  of the interaction subnet around the input protein. mpid also allows users to input a group of proteins to ascertain the interactions among them.

CONCLUSIONS
using a well-recognized interolog approach, we compiled a draft map of the ppi network in m. grisea, which can be characterized as a "scale-free" network. the reliability of our network has been clearly demonstrated by the results of three validation methods. for each predicted interaction within the network, two nominal p-values based on go terms and the expression correlation were proposed to assess its reliability. although the established network is far from complete and certainly contains many false positives, we hope it can provide new insights into the rice blast fungus.

we have found that the pathogenicity proteins encoded by the pathogenicity genes tend to have a higher average degree than that of the whole network, reflecting their special biological roles in the organism. we also observed that secreted proteins interact with fewer proteins. recently, a high-throughput analysis of the rice blast fungus genome was initiated, an indication that fungal genomics goes industrial  <cit> . in this context, the availability of this network will be helpful for future high-throughput ppi mapping projects. for instance, it may play an important role in choosing bait and prey in yeast two-hybrid experiments.
