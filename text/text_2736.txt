BACKGROUND
in most mammals the lnx  or pdzrn  family of proteins consists of five members that, in the interest of clarity, we shall refer to hereafter as lnx <dig> - lnx <dig>  these proteins are characterized by the presence of a ring domain  followed by between one and four pdz domains . within the lnx family, lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> are closely related and share an identical domain structure consisting of one ring and four pdz domains  <cit> . lnx <dig> and lnx <dig>  typically have a ring domain and two pdz domains; they are very similar to each other but more distantly related to lnx <dig> and lnx <dig>  <cit> . although lnx <dig>  lacks the ring domain, it is clearly a member of the family based on high sequence homology to lnx <dig> and lnx <dig>  <cit> . within vertebrates, the presence of ring and pdz domains in one protein is unique to the lnx family. ring domains function as the catalytic component of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases - enzymes that catalyze the final step in the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins and are believed to confer specificity to the ubiquitination process  <cit> . pdz domains are an important and abundant class of protein-protein interaction domains that often bind to the carboxy-terminus of their ligands  <cit> . the combination of ring and pdz domains in the lnx family proteins suggests that the ubiquitin ligase activity of these proteins may be targeted to specific substrate proteins by pdz domain-mediated interactions.

lnx <dig> was identified as a protein that interacts with numb and named ligand of numb protein x  <cit> . numb is a component of the notch signaling pathway that functions in the specification of cell fates during development and is known to control cell numbers during neurogenesis in vertebrates  <cit> . lnx <dig> can ubiquitinate numb, thereby targeting numb to proteasomal degradation  <cit> . the numb-lnx interaction involves a four amino acid npay motif in lnx <dig> binding to a phosphotyrosine-binding domain in numb  <cit> . subsequent to the characterisation of lnx <dig>  the highly homologous lnx <dig> protein was identified and shown to interact via its npaf motif with numb, as well as with its paralog numblike  <cit> . while the ability of lnx <dig>  and likely lnx <dig>  to ubiquitinate numb and thereby modulate notch signaling in cultured cells is very clear  <cit> , this function has not yet been demonstrated for lnx proteins in vivo during development.

apart from numb, several other interaction partners of lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> have been identified. these include signaling proteins such as the erbb <dig>  rhoc and c-src, the presynaptic protein cast, the melanoma/cancer-testis antigen mageb <dig> and several proteins associated with cell junctions such as claudin- <dig>  jam <dig> and the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor  <cit> . of these only c-src and claudin- <dig> were shown to be lnx <dig> substrates  <cit> . ubiquitination by lnx <dig> targets c-src for proteasomal degradation, whereas claudin- <dig> is endocytosed and trafficked to lysosomes  <cit> . the interactions with claudin- <dig>  jam <dig> and car suggest a possible role for lnx in the formation or remodeling of cell-cell junctions. in agreement with this, ectopic expression of lnx <dig> can remove claudins from cell junctions and can enhance tgfβ-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in epithelial cells  <cit> . however, the in vivo relevance of any of the aforementioned lnx <dig> or lnx <dig> interactions has yet to be demonstrated definitively. this is probably due to the fact that lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> proteins are expressed at exceedingly low levels in cell lines and in vivo <cit> . despite widespread mrna distribution  <cit> , reports on lnx <dig> or lnx <dig> protein expression are limited. lnx <dig> protein was found to localize very specifically within perisynaptic schwann cells at neuromuscular junctions  <cit> . both lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> proteins are present in spermatozoa, and lnx <dig> expression was reported in a subset of blood vessels during embryonic development  <cit> . however, the in vivo function of lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> proteins, in either these or other contexts, remain largely uncertain.

lnx <dig>  was first identified based on its interaction in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a semaphorin  <cit> . a similar approach identified pdz domain-mediated interactions of lnx <dig> with neuroligin <dig>  ephrin-b <dig> and the glur <dig> glutamate receptor subunit, but none of these interactions have been characterized further  <cit> . it was ko et al  who provided the first detailed description of lnx <dig> function  <cit> . they reported that lnx <dig> mrna is most highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and that lnx <dig> was required for the differentiation of c2c <dig> myoblasts into myotubes. the same group subsequently described a role for lnx <dig> in the bmp- <dig> -induced differentiation of c2c <dig> cells into osteoblasts  <cit> . in this context lnx <dig> acts as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting wnt-β-catenin signaling. a distinct role for lnx <dig> in neuromuscular junction formation has also been reported  <cit> . here lnx <dig> was found to interact with and ubiquitinate the muscle specific tyrosine kinase , thereby promoting its endocytosis and negatively regulating the cell surface expression of this key regulator of postsynaptic assembly. in agreement with this, transgenic overexpression of lnx <dig> was found to perturb neuromuscular junction formation in vivo <cit> . overall lnx <dig> appears to play distinct roles in the development and differentiation of both muscle and osteoblasts and is the best characterized of the mammalian lnx proteins.

lnx <dig>  and lnx <dig>  were identified in silico based on homology to lnx <dig>  <cit> . lnx <dig> is almost completely uncharacterized apart from a report that it is down regulated in the hypothalamus of sim <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . lnx <dig> was identified as a gene up-regulated in synovial sarcomas and was found to promote proliferation of synovial sarcoma cells  <cit> . in normal tissues lnx <dig> mrna expression is largely confined to the brain, but its physiological function here is unknown  <cit> .

in the present study, we take advantage of the availability of complete genome sequences for diverse metazoan species to examine the evolution of the lnx gene family for the first time. in particular, we focus on the phylogenetic origins of the family and the evolutionary relationship between lnx1/2-like and lnx3/4-like proteins. our analysis traces the ancestral lnx gene to the earliest metazoan lineage. we characterize what may be a novel, modular protein domain present in lnx <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  we also reveal a close phylogenetic relationship between the lnx and mupp <dig> protein families. based on this relationship, we identify novel lnx1- and lnx2-interacting proteins.

RESULTS
identification of lnx1/lnx <dig> orthologs
lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> share exactly the same domain architecture  and display 50% amino acid sequence identity. orthologs of both lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> are found in virtually all vertebrates for which complete genome sequences are available. in addition, fish, marsupial, amphibian and bird genomes have a third lnx1/2-like gene that has been termed lnx-like or lnx2b in zebra fish  <cit>  and confusingly called lnx <dig> in chicken and marsupials  <cit> . we suggest that this paralog be called lnx2b to reflect the fact that it encodes a protein that is most similar to lnx <dig>  eutherian mammals have only two lnx1/2-like genes with the loss of lnx2b occuring when it underwent pseudogenization and contributed several exons to the non-coding xist rna that controls x-chromosome inactivation  <cit> .

database searches for invertebrate lnx <dig> or lnx <dig> orthologs identified a single lnx gene, most similar to lnx <dig>  in representative species of some, but not all non-vertebrate bilaterian lineages . thus a clear lnx1/ <dig> ortholog was identified in the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae and in the platyhelminth schistosoma mansoni, but not in the urochordates, arthropods, nematodes or molluscs . lnx1/2-related proteins that lack the ring domain were identified in the hemichordate saccoglossus kowalevskii and the echinoderm strongylocentrotus pupuratus. examining more basal metazoan lineages, we did not find lnx1/ <dig> orthologs in cnidaria or placozoa, but a lnx1/ <dig> ortholog is found in the poriferan amphimedon queenslandica <cit> . no lnx1/ <dig> ortholog was found in choanoflagellates or any other non-metazoan species. thus the ancestral lnx1/2-like gene appears to have an early metazoan origin prior to the divergence of porifera  from other metazoans, but has subsequently been lost from several lineages. this gene is likely to have been duplicated in the vertebrate ancestor, giving rise to vertebrate lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and lnx2b.

lnx1/lnx <dig> and multiple pdz protein <dig>  share a common ancestor
in searching for lnx1/ <dig> orthologs we noticed a high degree of sequence similarity between the lnx1/ <dig> pdz domains and the carboxy-terminal pdz domains from mupp <dig> and its paralog inadl/patj. mupp <dig> contains an amino terminal l <dig> domain and  <dig> pdz domains, while inadl/patj has the same architecture but has just  <dig> pdz domains. to examine this relationship more closely, we generated a phylogenetic tree to compare the vertebrate lnx <dig> pdz domains with all the pdz domains from human and t. adhaerens mupp <dig> proteins as well as those from a. queenslandica lnx <dig> . the tree reveals a close relationship between pdz domains 1- <dig> of lnx <dig> and domains 10- <dig> respectively of mupp <dig>  examination of splice junctions within the pdz domains confirmed this relationship with domains  <dig>   <dig> and <dig> of mupp <dig> having splice junctions at exactly the same positions as domains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively of lnx <dig> . this relationship suggests that the lnx1/ <dig> pdz domains and the four carboxy-terminal domains of mupp <dig> are derived from a common ancestor. the choanoflagellate, monsiga brevicollis, lacks a lnx1/ <dig> ortholog but has a mupp1-like protein with  <dig> pdz domains. mupp <dig> and lnx <dig> proteins are thus likely to be derived from a mupp1-like protein in the ancestral metazoan lineage.

identification of lnx3/lnx4/lnx <dig> orthologs
lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> proteins show close to 60% amino acid identity. the sequence similarity spans the amino terminal ring and two pdz domains, as well as extensive regions in the non-modular carboxy-terminal half of the protein. although lnx <dig> lacks a ring domain and has only one pdz domain, it is 50% identical to lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> and contains the conserved carboxy-terminal regions, confirming it as a true paralog. most vertebrate genomes encode both a lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> ortholog, though a few species lack one or the other gene . specifically, canis familiaris  and ornithorhynchus anatinus  appear to lack lnx <dig>  while no lnx <dig> homolog is found in monodelphis domestica . lnx <dig> is found in most amphibian, fish and mammalian species but seems to be absent from birds. invertebrate orthologs of lnx3/lnx <dig> containing ring and pdz domains are found in some metazoan lineages including hemichordates  and echinoderms, cnidarians  and placozoans  . all of these invertebrate lnx <dig> orthologs contain two pdz domains with the exception of t. adhaerens in which the second pdz is not discernible. no pdz domain-containing lnx <dig> homolog is found in the draft assembly of the poriferan a. queenslandica genome  <cit> , nor was an ortholog found in the choanoflagellate m brevicollis. a lnx3/4-like protein can thus be traced back to the common ancestor of cnidarians, placozoans and bilaterians. duplications of the ancestral lnx3/4-like gene gave rise to lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> in vertebrates with lnx <dig> losing the exons encoding the ring and one pdz domain.

characterisation of a lnx <dig> homology domain
the carboxy-terminal half of lnx <dig> lacks any identifiable domains annotated in the pfam, smart or interpro databases  <cit> , yet this region is highly conserved in lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> and in all invertebrate lnx3/ <dig> orthologs with the exception of t. adhaerens. within this region, the last  <dig> amino acids are particularly similar and the degree of cross-species sequence identity is as high as that for the pdz and ring domains. in fact, many invertebrate lineages have lnx3/4-like proteins that contain this highly conserved carboxy-terminal region, but lack the characteristic ring domain and may also be missing one or both of the pdz domains . lineages that have such "ring-less" or "ring and pdz-less" lnx3/ <dig> relatives include arthropods , nematodes  and cephalochordates . katoh and katoh  had previously identified conserved sequences shared by lnx3/ <dig> and d. melanogaster slip <dig> . with the availability of sequences from other species, we can better define this conserved region that we term the lnx <dig> homology  domain. figure  <dig> shows a multiple sequence alignment of the carboxy-terminal regions of vertebrate lnx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and selected invertebrate lnx <dig> orthologs. the high degree of sequence conservation between diverse species within this region is apparent and indeed automated domain detection methods identify this region as a potential domain  <cit> . such conservation is not seen in the rest of the sequence . notably the d. melanogaster slip <dig> is shorter than all other sequences examined including several other arthropods, thus the consensus lnx <dig> homology region is more extensive than that previously identified  <cit> .

we used the multiple sequence alignment to generate a protein secondary structure prediction for the lnx3h domain on the jpred  <dig> server  <cit> . the jpred algorithim predicts several alpha-helical regions with a high degree of confidence as well as some potential beta sheets or regions with an extended confirmation . the conservation of this region across diverse species and secondary structure prediction are consistent with this  <dig> amino acid region being a modular folded domain with functions independent of the ring and pdz domains.

phylogenetic relationship between lnx1/ <dig> and lnx3/4
the combination of an amino terminal ring domain with carboxy-terminal pdz domains  appears to be unique to the lnx family. in principle, however, the common domain architecture of lnx1/2-like and lnx3/4-like proteins may have arisen independently. pdz and ring domains are abundant in metazoan genomes and so the independent evolution of a ring-pdzn architecture more than once is plausible. indeed, in arthropods this domain combination does seem to have arisen independently, but in the reverse order . since lnx1/ <dig> and lnx3/ <dig> have only limited sequence homology in non-modular regions we examined the relationships between the ring and pdz domains of lnx1- <dig>  using a blastp search, we find that the most similar protein sequences to the ring domain of human lnx <dig> are the ring domains of lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> respectively . to examine relationships between the pdz domains, we have generated a phylogenetic tree from an alignment of all human pdz domains . we find that pdz <dig> of lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> clusters very tightly with pdz <dig> of lnx <dig> and lnx <dig>  while the pdz <dig> domains from all four proteins are likewise closely related. these close relationships between both the ring and pdz domains of lnx1/ <dig> and lnx3/ <dig> as compared to any other sequences in the human genome argue strongly that they did indeed arise from a single evolutionary event that combined an amino-terminal ring domain with pdz domains at the carboxy-terminal side.

our analysis indicates that lnx1/ <dig> and lnx3/ <dig> did share a common ancestor and that the two pdz domains in lnx3/ <dig> correspond to pdz domains  <dig> and  <dig> of lnx1/ <dig>  this suggests two possible scenarios for the evolution of the lnx family: 1) a lnx1/2-like protein with four pdz domains might have arisen from a lnx3/ <dig> like ancestor through acquisition/duplication of pdz domains; 2) a lnx3/4-like protein with two pdz domain may have arisen from a lnx1/2-like ancestor protein through loss of two pdz domains. the poriferan a. queenslandica has a lnx <dig> ortholog with four pdz domains. the most basal lineages with a clear lnx3/ <dig> homolog are placozoans and cnidarians. while the a. queenslandica genome is not completely assembled, it appears that a lnx1/2-like protein predates the evolution of lnx3/ <dig>  our analysis of lnx <dig> pdz domains indicates that they are closely related to the most carboxy-terminal pdz domains of mupp <dig> and are derived from a common ancestor . a. queenslandica has a mupp <dig> ortholog indicating that lnx <dig> and mupp derived from a common multiple pdz domain-containing protein in the ancestor of metazoans. we propose a model for the evolution of the lnx family in which an ancestral lnx2-like protein in the earliest metazoans gave rise to a lnx3/4-like protein with two pdz domains . the highly conserved lnx3h domain is found in most lineages from cnidarians onward suggesting that it arose in lnx3/ <dig> subsequent to the loss of the carboxy-terminal pdz domains. lnx <dig> was lost in many metazoan lineages but retained in vertebrates. lnx3/ <dig> orthologs are found in most metazoans; but in many lineages these orthologs have lost the ring domain and in some cases the pdz domains, leaving the lnx3h domain as the most defining characteristic of this branch of the lnx family. in vertebrates, duplications of the ancestral lnx1/2-like gene gave rise to lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and lnx2b and likewise gene duplication generated lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> from the lnx3/4-like ancestral gene.

identification of common lnx1/ <dig> and mupp <dig> interaction partners
the shared phylogenetic origins of the lnx <dig> and mupp <dig> pdz domains prompted us to examine whether the two proteins share any interacting proteins. proteins that interact with pdz domains 10- <dig> of mupp <dig>  or the equivalent domains from inadl/patj , were identified by searching the primary literature and protein interaction databases. among these proteins, claudin- <dig> and car, have been independently reported to interact with lnx <dig> and/or lnx <dig>  <cit> , while four common ligands of mupp <dig> and lnx <dig> were reported in a large-scale analysis of pdz domain interactions using protein microarrays  <cit> . we reasoned that novel ligands for lnx pdz domains might be identified among known mupp <dig> or inadl/patj interactors. using the yeast two-hybrid system, we tested whether the carboxy-terminal peptides from three known mupp <dig> interactors, htr2c , syngap <dig>  and tapp <dig> , could also bind to lnx <dig> or lnx <dig>  in addition, we examined the previously reported lnx <dig> and mupp <dig> ligand, epha <dig> in order to confirm these interactions in an independent assay  <cit> . all four proteins interacted with mupp1-pdz10- <dig> as judged by activation of both the his <dig> and βgal reporter genes . this serves as a positive control for the expression and functionality of the bait constructs. to test for interactions with lnx <dig> we used constructs lacking either the ring domain  or the 3rd and 4th pdz domains  as prey. these truncated constructs were used because, in contrast to lnx <dig>  full-length lnx <dig> protein was not functional in the yeast two-hybrid system. htr2c did not show any evidence of an interaction with lnx <dig> constructs and showed only moderate expression of one reporter gene when binding to lnx <dig> was assessed . in contrast, syngap <dig>  tapp <dig> and epha <dig> all showed an interaction with lnx <dig> and/or lnx <dig>  as judged by activation of both reporter genes. some lnx <dig> interactions were only observed using the carboxy-terminal truncated ring-pdz <dig> construct. this may be because pdz <dig> of lnx <dig> can bind its own carboxy-terminus, thereby preventing other proteins from binding efficiently to this domain  <cit> . to demonstrate the specificity of these interactions, the ability of carboxy-terminal peptides from syngap <dig>  tapp <dig> and epha <dig> to bind to unrelated pdz domains was assessed. no interactions were observed with the pdz domains of either erbb2ip or nos <dig>  while only syngap <dig> showed an interaction with the pdz domain-containing protein dlg <dig> . this interaction is expected based on the previously reported interaction of syngap <dig> with dlg <dig>  <cit> . overall these observations indicate that the interactions of syngap <dig>  tapp <dig> and epha <dig> with lnx proteins are very specific.

the ability of carboxyl terminal sequences from the indicated mupp <dig> interacting proteins  to interact with lnx <dig> and lnx <dig>  was tested using the yeast two-hybrid system. an empty prey vector and a mupp <dig> prey were included as negative and positive controls respectively. interactions with unrelated pdz domain-containing proteins  were assessed to demonstrate the specificity of binding to lnx proteins. interactions between bait and prey were indicated by expression of two reporter genes - his <dig> and lacz coding for β-galactosidase . truncated lnx <dig> constructs were used because the full-length protein was not functional in the yeast two-hybrid system. n/d = not determined.

our strategy of screening known mupp <dig> interacting proteins was thus successful in identifying three novel ligands for the lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> pdz domains. we also confirmed the common interaction of lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and mupp <dig> with epha <dig> and show that epha <dig> can bind, not only to an isolated lnx <dig> pdz domain  <cit> , but also to full-length lnx <dig> and near full-length lnx <dig> proteins. to evaluate the scope for other shared interactions, we examined some of the key ligand-binding residues within the pdz domains of lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and mupp <dig>  <cit> . for the most part these residues are highly conserved in all three proteins . in agreement with this, a recent computational analysis of pdz domain interactions  <cit>  predicts numerous common ligands for mupp1-pdz10- <dig> and the lnx1/lnx <dig> pdz domains . many of these interactions are mediated by equivalent pdz domains from both proteins - in agreement with their common phylogenetic origins.

discussion
we have undertaken the current phylogenetic analysis with a view to gleaning some insights into the functions of the poorly characterized lnx protein family. we find that the sponge a. queenslandica has a lnx1/ <dig> ortholog. thus the ancestral lnx1/ <dig> gene would have evolved in very primitive metazoans, that likely consisted of layers of cells but lacked distinct tissues. this suggests that the original lnx1/ <dig> protein probably had a general cellular function, one that perhaps related to the development of multicellular metazoans but was not specific to a particular tissue type or organ system. it remains to be seen whether the function of the lnx1/ <dig> ortholog in present day poriferans is closely related to its ancestral function and whether studying lnx1/ <dig> in poriferans could provide clues as to the roles of lnx1/ <dig> orthologs in other lineages.

whatever the role of the ancestral lnx1/ <dig> protein was, it is apparent that this function is not essential in invertebrates since many lineages, such as arthropods and nematodes, lack a lnx1/2-like protein. nevertheless the lnx1/ <dig> gene was maintained in the lineage leading to vertebrates and duplicated to give rise to the paralogous lnx <dig>  lnx <dig> and lnx2b genes in vertebrates. the duplication of the ancestral lnx1/ <dig> gene was probably a result of the two rounds  of large-scale gene or whole-genome duplication that are thought to have occurred early in the vertebrate lineage  <cit> . the loss of lnx-2b through pseudogenization in eutherian mammals is indicative of some redundancy of function between the lnx1/ <dig> paralogs, but the maintenance of at least two paralogs in all vertebrates is suggestive of an essential function for lnx1/2-like proteins in vertebrates  <cit> . lnx <dig> was first described as a ligand of numb - an interaction that is mediated by an npay motif in lnx <dig> and the phosphotyrosine binding domain of numb  <cit> . lnx <dig> has an npaf motif that can also bind numb  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the invertebrate lnx1/ <dig> orthologs lack such a motif; therefore, they would not be expected to bind numb or modulate notch signaling via degradation of numb. it is possible that the ability to interact with and regulate numb is an essential vertebrate specific function that explains the presence of lnx1/ <dig> orthologs in all vertebrates. this remains speculative however until the in vivo significance of this interaction is clarified by loss of function studies. during zebra fish embryogenesis, lnx-2b functions in the establishment of the dorso-ventral axis by modulating the activity of the transcriptional repressor bozozok  <cit> . whether lnx-2b in amphibians or birds, or lnx <dig> in mammals, has a similar function is unclear, since there does not appear to be a clear bozozok homolog in these lineages.

phylogenetic analysis reveals that the original lnx1/ <dig> protein shared a common ancestor with mupp <dig> and inadl/patj - proteins that are found at tight junctions in epithelial cells  <cit> . lnx <dig> has been shown to interact with the cell junction associated proteins jam <dig>  claudin- <dig> and car and shares the latter two interactions with mupp <dig>  <cit> . taken together these observations, along with the evolution of the ancestral lnx1/ <dig> gene in early multicellular metazoans, support a possible function for lnx1/ <dig> at cell-cell junctions. while endogenous lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> have not been localized to cell junctions, roles for lnx <dig> in the modulation of cell junctions have been suggested from studies using exogenously expressed proteins  <cit> . it is possible that low expression levels and a transient association with cell junction proteins might preclude the detection of endogenous lnx proteins at these structures. interestingly, endogenous lnx <dig> and mupp <dig> have been localized to the acrosomal region of mammalian spermatozoa where car is also found  <cit> . this is suggestive of related functions for lnx <dig> and mupp <dig> in this context.

in addition to common interactions with claudin- <dig> and car, we have identified two known mupp <dig> ligands, tapp <dig> and syngap <dig> as novel interaction partners for lnx1and/or lnx <dig>  furthermore, we have confirmed a common interaction of mupp <dig> and lnx1/lnx <dig> with epha <dig>  full length lnx <dig> shows convincing interactions with epha <dig> and syngap, while full length lnx <dig> interacts with epha <dig>  by contrast strong evidence for interactions of tapp <dig> and syngap with lnx <dig> is only observed using the carboxy-terminal truncated ring-pdz <dig> construct. this may be because pdz <dig> of lnx <dig> can bind its own carboxy-terminus, thereby preventing other proteins from binding efficiently to this domain  <cit> . while lnx <dig> is also thought to bind its own c terminus in the same way as lnx <dig>  <cit> , it may be that in the case of lnx <dig> the affinity of this interaction is lower than the affinity for syngap <dig> and tapp <dig>  the binding of lnx1/lnx <dig> to their own carboxy-termini might serve to regulate their interactions with such ligands.

tapp <dig> is a phosphatidylinositol  bisphosphate binding protein that appears to function as a negative regulator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling  <cit> . syngap <dig> is a synaptic ras-gtpase activating protein that regulates synapse development and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . epha <dig> functions in axon guidance and in the regulation of apoptosis in neural progenitors  <cit> . confirmation and further investigation of these interactions may reveal novel roles for lnx <dig> and lnx <dig> in cell signaling and nervous system development. overall, an appreciation of the phylogenetic relationship between the pdz domains of lnx1/ <dig> and mupp1/inadl/patj will be important in elucidating the cellular functions of both of these poorly understood protein families.

our model for the evolution of the lnx family indicates that an invertebrate lnx3/ <dig> ortholog arose from the ancestral lnx1/2-like protein through loss of two pdz domains. the most basal species with a lnx3/ <dig> ortholog is the placozoan t. adhaerens. this protein, which has a ring and one pdz domain, may represent an intermediate step in the evolution of lnx3/ <dig>  if this is the case, then the ancestral lnx1/ <dig> would, in fact, have lost three pdz domains and the single remaining pdz domain might have duplicated to generate the two pdz domains found in other lnx3/ <dig> orthologs. supporting this idea, an analysis of splicing junctions shows that both pdz domains in lnx <dig> and in lnx <dig> and the single domain in lnx <dig> have a splice site at the same position as pdz <dig> of lnx1/ <dig> . however, the relationships between these domains in a phylogenetic tree of all pdz domains don't agree with this hypothesis . therefore, it seems equally possible that the ancestral lnx3/ <dig> gene originally encoded two pdz domains, one of which was subsequently lost in t. adhaerens. the t. adhaerens protein also lacks the lnx3h domain or any significant homology to other lnx3/ <dig> orthologs in the region carboxy-terminal to the pdz domains. again this may represent an intermediate step in which a non modular sequence replaced some of the four lnx1/ <dig> pdz domains prior to the evolution of the lnx3h domain and other conserved regions.

during evolution rearrangements of existing protein domains give rise to novel domain combinations and architectures that facilitate functional diversification of proteins without the need to invent new protein modules  <cit> . increased rates of domain rearrangements and the appearance of novel domain combinations are associated with major lineage diversification events, particularly the emergence of metazoans  <cit> . in addition, diversity of domains architectures increases with organismal complexity  <cit> . the evolution of the lnx family through the combination of ring and pdz domains appears to be a part of this metazoan diversification of domain architectures. the addition of domains involved in binding to those with catalytic activity via fusion events has been noted to occur with a high frequency during domain rearrangements  <cit> . thus a role for the lnx pdz domains in targeting/modulating the ubiquitin ligase activity of a ring domain would be in keeping with a larger evolutionary trend. our observation that a unique fusion event likely gave rise to the ring-pdzn architecture is in keeping with the prevalence of fusion events during domain rearrangements, and the findings that domain additions occur most frequently at the ends of proteins and that most domain architectures have a single evolutionary origin  <cit> . however, the evolution of the reversed  domain arrangement in arthropods does seem to have occurred independently. while in principal this domain order could arise through circular permutation of the lnx architecture, such events are relatively rare  <cit> , and the pdz and ring domains in arthropod pdz-ring proteins are not closely related to those in the lnx family arguing against this possibility. our model of lnx protein evolution proposes that duplication of a lnx1/2-like  ancestor gave rise to a lnx3/4-like  protein. we cannot be certain of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the loss of the two c-terminal pdz domains and appearance of the lnx3h domain and other conserved region in lnx3/4/ <dig>  a duplication-degeneration mechanism  <cit>  followed by de novo evolution of the putative lnx3h domain is one possibility, but a fusion event that inserted the lnx <dig> homology-encoding region from an existing gene into the ancestral lnx gene is also plausible. sequencing of lnx homologs from additional basal metazoan lineages may resolve these possibilities.

apart from t. adhaerens, all invertebrate and vertebrate lnx3/ <dig> orthologs contain the highly conserved carboxy-terminal region of  <dig> amino acids that we define here as the lnx3h domain. a previous comparison of lnx <dig> and the d. melanogaster lnx3/4-like protein slip <dig> had identified two conserved regions apart from the pdz domains  <cit> . by analyzing a more diverse set of invertebrate species, we find that only one of these, the lnx3h domain located at the carboxy-terminal, is widely conserved. furthermore, slip <dig> is truncated relative to all other lnx3/4-like sequences examined, including those in a variety of other arthropods. the d. melanogaster sequence is thus anomalous and the region of highly conserved sequence in lnx3/4-like proteins is about  <dig> amino acids longer than previously described. secondary structure prediction for the lnx3h region indicates a high helical content, while an examination of amino acid composition reveals a very high proportion of charged amino acids, especially positively charged lysines and arginines . these observations are consistent with this region folding as a globular domain, but biophysical and structural approaches must now be applied to determine this definitively.

cnidarians make up the most basal lineage that have the lnx3h domain, and representative organisms in all bilaterian lineages examined encode a protein in which this domain is present. the basic lnx3/ <dig> domain architecture seen in cnidaria has been maintained in vertebrates, yet in many invertebrate lineages, the ring and in some cases the pdz domains have been lost. the lnx3h domain is thus more conserved across diverse invertebrate lineages than the ring and pdz domains. some species such as c. elegans have a protein that contains the lnx3h domain in the absence of any other recognizable domains. together, these observations suggest that the lnx3h domain has functions that are independent of the ring and pdz domains and that may be more important than the functions of the other domains, at least in invertebrates. to date, however, the function of the lnx3h domain in any species is completely unclear. since the lnx3h domain is conserved in lnx <dig>  its presence in a protein may be a better way of defining the lnx3/4/ <dig> subfamily than the presence of both a ring and pdz domain.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first, thorough examination of the molecular evolution of the lnx gene family. based on our findings an exploration of common interactions and cellular functions of lnx1/ <dig> and mupp <dig> is merited. structural and functional characterization of the lnx3h domain should also provide insights into the lnx3/4/ <dig> subfamily. our analysis thus provides a useful framework for the further characterization of the enigmatic lnx proteins.
