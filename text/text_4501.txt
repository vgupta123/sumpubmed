BACKGROUND
over the past few years, the investigation of β2-microglobulin  amyloidogenesis has shed light on the pathogenesis of dialysis related amyloidosis   <cit>  and has provided general information on the mechanism of structural transition of globular proteins into amyloid fibrils  <cit> . single amino acid substitutions in the protein sequence enabled us to demonstrate the pivotal role of the two tryptophan  residues in the function and amyloidogenic propensity of this protein. moreover, we have recently discovered a functional role of trp <dig> in promoting the intermolecular association of β2-m with the mhci heavy chain and in enhancing the conformational flexibility of the loop between strands d-e and the n-terminal stretch  <cit> . this conformational flexibility involving trp <dig> is necessary for the optimal binding of β2-m to the mhci heavy chain, although, at the same time, this increases the intrinsic tendency of the protein to self aggregate.

in contrast, trp <dig> is buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein and is apparently essential for its stability; however trp <dig> does not contribute directly to the binding of the mhci heavy chain. tryptophan is a relatively rare amino acid within a protein sequence and its large hydrophobic surface area containing the heterocyclic ring system has a unique role in protein folding and function  <cit> . these two properties drive protein remodelling during evolution wherein a trade-off exists between mutations that endow better protein function regardless of protein fitness and compensatory mutations that improve stability  <cit> . the two trp residues of β2-m represent two examples of how this amino acid can affect protein structure or function; therefore, we analysed the evolutionary tree and the conservation of the two residues in vertebrates expressing mhci molecules. we have discovered that trp <dig> is highly conserved, whereas, in some of the most basal taxa, leu is present in position  <dig>  to understand the possible positive effects of the replacement of leu <dig> with trp we investigated the structural impact of this mutation on human β2-m.

RESULTS
conservation and phylogenetic analysis
we used the famfetch tool with the entry name b2mg_human to search the hovergen database. the retrieved family, hbg <dig>  consisted of  <dig> protein sequences from  <dig> different species with gnathostomata as a common ancestor. we selected a single sequence for each species and the clustalw algorithm was used to align the resulting  <dig> proteins . a simple conservation analysis of the amino acids based on this multiple alignment allowed us to compute conservation, quality and consensus annotation for a specific region . in the multiple alignment, trp <dig> and trp <dig> of mature β2-m are located at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and both show a consensus over 90% . this observation represents the first evidence of the relevance of the two amino acids. however, the conservation and the quality annotation show that the chemistry and the quality of the conservation is high for trp <dig> , but quite low for trp <dig>  suggesting a high probability of mutation for trp <dig>  as described previously, while trp <dig> is solvent-exposed and essential for promoting intermolecular association, trp <dig> is buried in the hydrophobic cavity of the protein delimited by residues ser <dig>  asn <dig>  leu <dig>  phe <dig>  pro <dig> and tyr <dig>  this analysis shows that all these amino acids have a high percentage of consensus, as well as high values of conservation and quality annotation: ser <dig> : 91%,  <dig>   <dig> ; asn <dig> : 98%,  <dig>   <dig> ; leu <dig> : 95%,  <dig>   <dig> ; phe <dig> : 95%,  <dig>   <dig> ; pro <dig> : 98%,  <dig>   <dig> ; tyr <dig> : 89%,  <dig>   <dig> .

the phylogenetic tree was constructed using four different methods: neighbor-joining , maximal parsimony , minimum evolution  and bayesian inference . the taxonomy of the organisms was considered as a species tree  with triakis scyllium and raja eglanteria as the most basal, both belonging to chondrichthyes , which was also the most divergent class. the distinction between those two species can only be based on the fossil records of the corresponding genus; in fact the triakis genus is dated from the palaeocene  <dig> - <dig>  ma , whereas the raja genus is from the maastrichtian . for this reason, we selected raja eglanteria as a unique and the most basal taxon. therefore, we re-rooted the gene trees by selecting as root the raja eglanteria protein, b2mg_rajeg. moreover, the sequence from triakis scyllium has limited similarity with all the other family members, so the alignment and the subsequent conclusions on the conservation would have limited reliability. it is worth noting that the most basal species, in which β2-m is present, belong to cartilaginous fishes; therefore, we can approximately date the appearance of the protein at about  <dig> ma   <cit> . therefore, we can assume that the appearance of β2-m in vertebrates is coincident with the appearance of adaptive immunity and the expression of mhci and related molecules.

the evolution of β2-m is similarly represented by the four re-rooted gene trees and the species tree. the topology of these four gene trees was compared with the species tree by computing the robinson-foulds metric. the gene tree, which better follows species evolution, was constructed by bi   and was considered as the reference gene tree. a simple reconciliation analysis performed on  <dig> representative species confirmed the topology agreement between gene and species trees . the main differences between gene and species trees are the positions of the sequences from the unique amphibia organism, xenopus laevis and paralichthys olivaceous . choi et al. demonstrated that the β2-m of paralichthys olivaceous  is very similar to that of other sea-fish, such as raja eglanteria, but it is phylogenetically distant from other β2-m proteins belonging to fishes , ictalurus punctatus , oncorhynchus mykiss  and ctenopharyngodon idella   <cit> . the reconciled trees show few duplications of the gene that explains the difference between species and gene trees ; it is interesting that the first duplication seems to be influenced by the presence of leu or trp <dig>  similar conclusions can be achieved by analysing the more complex tree obtained from the reconciliation of the whole gene and species trees .

in the gene tree reported in figure  <dig>  the name of each related protein is preceded by the one letter code of the two residues associated with the  <dig> and  <dig> positions corresponding to trp <dig> and trp <dig>  respectively, in mature β2-m. the comparison between the species and the gene trees allows us to analyse the phylogenetic evolution of positions  <dig> and  <dig>  most of the sequences contain tryptophan. only a few sequences have different amino acids in these positions. in particular, a pseudo-cluster of three proteins, derived from chondrichthyes , actinopterygii  and amphibia , contains trp at position  <dig> and leu at position  <dig> instead of trp. it is worth noting that the gene tree clearly shows an evolutionary divergence of β2-m in warm-blooded vertebrates and fish  <cit> . thus, the phylogenetic analysis shows that, in some species belonging to lineages like cartilaginous fishes and amphibians, there is a different hydrophobic residue, leucine, at position  <dig>  most likely, trp <dig> is the result of a diversification process arising during the evolution of the adaptive immune response system  <cit> . the evidence that all species encoding mhci contain trp <dig> demonstrates the essential role of this residue. these results were confirmed by performing both joint and marginal reconstruction of the ancestral sequence: this sequence has a trp at position  <dig> and a leu at position  <dig> with good joint log likelihood values at these positions; moreover, good confidence of the reconstruction at these sites was estimated by marginal probabilities .

experimental analysis of the role of the two trp residues in the structure and function of β2-m
we have previously shown that the invariance of trp in the evolutionary tree can be rationalized by the essential role of trp <dig> in the binding of the mhci complex  <cit> . in fact, the indole ring of trp <dig> fits perfectly into a low-polarity niche within the heavy-chain association interface ; it provides an interchain hydrogen bond that is highly conserved in complexes with mhci and cd <dig>  <cit> . trp <dig> is completely exposed to solvent in its role of anchoring β2-m to mhci, while trp <dig> is fully buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein and its replacement with a small non-hydrophobic amino acid, such as glycine, affects the overall structure and stability of β2-m  <cit> . the discovery, through phylogenetic analysis, that three basal species from the classes chondrichthyes, actinopterygii and amphibia display a leu in position  <dig> prompted us to produce a leu <dig> variant of human β2-m to analyse the effect of this replacement on the stability and dynamics of β2-m folding. since the main intrinsic fluorescence of β2-m originates from trp <dig>  we have investigated its folding stability and kinetics using circular dichroism . figure  <dig> reports the comparative analysis of guanidinium chloride  unfolding of the trp95leu variant and wild-type β2-m, monitored through analysis of cd spectra and measurement of ellipticity at  <dig> nm. the presence of leu at site  <dig> induces a destabilization of  <dig>  kcal/mol, with a cm shift from  <dig>  to  <dig>  m gdnhcl. stopped flow cd apparatus was required to monitor the kinetics of folding and unfolding  on the millisecond to second time-scale, whereas a conventional cd spectropolarimeter was used to determine slow changes in the minute time-scale. the kinetics of folding of β2-m can be dissected into three phases: a very fast phase occurring in the lag time of the measurement , followed by a fast  and a slow phase . the presence of leu does not affect the measurable phase of refolding; the hydrophobicity of the leu side chain guarantees the collapse of the hydrophobic core of the molecule and further organization of the secondary structure with the same efficiency as trp. in fact, the rate constant of the fast phase of folding, monitored at  <dig> nm, was  <dig>   s- <dig> for both proteins. the full recovery of native structure was measured in the near uv region and kinetic traces were acquired at the representative wavelength of  <dig> nm. in each case, an exponential phase was detected and the same resulting rate constant,  <dig>   s- <dig>  was determined for both proteins. the lack of the trp <dig> indole ring affects mainly the folding stability; in fact the unfolding kinetics is affected by the trp-leu replacement. figure  <dig>  shows that upon exposure to  <dig>  m gdnhcl, leu <dig> β2-m unfolds at a higher rate constant,  <dig>   s- <dig> compared with the wild-type protein,  <dig>   s- <dig>  in perfect agreement with the reduced stability of the variant at equilibrium.

a reduced folding stability of β2-m variants generally correlates with a higher propensity for self aggregation and formation of amyloid fibrils  <cit> . in figure  <dig> we report the results of the fibrillogenesis test carried out at neutral ph and 20% trifluoroethanol , where we compared the amount of amyloid fibrils produced from wild-type and the leu <dig> variant of β2-m. both the thioflavin assay and the classical green birefringence typical of amyloid clearly confirm the hypothesis of a higher amyloidogenic propensity of the variant carrying this ancestral amino acid substitution.

the experimental data are in good agreement with the prediction of the aggregation propensity, calculated according to tartaglia et al  <cit> . in particular, the carboxy terminal end of the protein around position  <dig> shows a significantly lower aggregation propensity for human β2-m compared with that of raja β2-m. .

crystal structure of the trp95leu β2-m mutant
the trp95leu mutant was crystallised according to the protocol used for the trp60val β2-m mutant  <cit> , yielding crystals belonging to the same space group and with the same crystal packing observed for the β2-m de loop mutants, as recently reported  <cit> . trp95leu mutant crystals diffracted to a resolution of  <dig>  Å. in accordance with the single residue mutation, the trp95leu mutant crystal structure is very similar to that of wild-type β2-m , and the mutated leu <dig> side chain matches the location of the trp <dig> indole ring in the wild-type protein . on the other hand, the cavity created by residues ser <dig>  asn <dig>  leu <dig>  phe <dig>  pro <dig> and tyr <dig>  which perfectly fits the bulky side chain of trp <dig> in wild-type β2-m, is only half filled by leu <dig> . given the hydrophobicity of the cavity, however, no water molecules appear to fill the gaps, leaving the cavity partially empty. such a condition is unfavourable for protein stability and, together with the loss of an h bond, certainly contributes to the lower stability observed for the trp95leu mutant. in fact, trp <dig> can establish an h bond with the carbonyl of asp <dig>  or with the carboxyl group of met <dig> . consequently, the presence of the mutated leu <dig> residue is reflected by increased flexibility of the downstream residues. the whole 96- <dig> segment displays poor electron density, and could only be modelled with  <dig>  occupancy. conversely, all previously reported mutants that were crystallized under the same conditions and whose crystals were isomorphous with those of the trp95leu mutant, consistently showed very good electron density for the c-terminal segment  <cit> .

another unexpected structural difference observed in the trp95leu mutant is located in the de loop. such a loop was observed in several conformations in different β2-m structures and/or variants  <cit> , but it always displayed high quality electron density. in the trp95leu isoform the electron density for the de loop is of poor quality; such a loop was modelled in two alternative conformations, with residual electron density suggesting an even higher number of conformations. relative to the de loop, residue  <dig> is located on the opposite pole of the β2-m tertiary structure; in the crystal packing, however, the two regions, from spatially neighbouring molecules, fall close to each other, hence the observed flexibility of the c-terminal region may affect the conformational flexibility of the de loop.

CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that trp <dig> of β2-m is highly conserved, which is consistent with its essential role in the binding of β2-m to the heavy chain of mhci. in contrast, trp <dig> is buried in a hydrophobic cavity and contributes to protein stability and in some species is replaced by leu . our data suggest that the divergence between trp or leu at position  <dig> and the subsequent selection of trp in the very large majority of species is based on a significant thermodynamic stabilization of the protein which also limits the intrinsic propensity of β2-m to make amyloid fibrils  <cit> . such an effect can be explained by the perfect fit of trp <dig> in the hydrophobic cavity delimited by the side chains of ser <dig>  leu <dig>  phe <dig>  pro <dig>  tyr <dig> and arg <dig>  in the core of β2-m.

moreover, because the tendency to self-aggregate correlates with intracellular sequestration and degradation through quality control, it is plausible that a better stability and a lower aggregation propensity have favoured a much better yield of correctly folded β2-m.
