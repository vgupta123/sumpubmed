BACKGROUND
the guanine nucleotide binding protein -coupled receptor  family represents the largest group of cell surface receptors that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation  <cit> . the silencing of gpr <dig>  as gpcr is highly expressed in the fetal liver  and premature erythroblast, has no effects on primitive erythropoiesis but significantly reduces definitive erythropoiesis through the camp/pka/creb pathway  <cit> . inactivation of gpr <dig> induces remarkable decreases in the proliferation of definitive erythroid progenitors and erythroblast islands in fl  <cit> . gpcrs are linked via g proteins to adenylyl cyclase, phospholipases, and ionic conductance channels  <cit> . thus, the gαs protein is known to couple gpcrs to adenylyl cyclase to stimulate formation of the second messenger camp. it has been found that, upon activation of the camp pathway, expression of the gamma -globin gene is induced in adult erythroblasts  <cit> . once formed, camp consecutively stimulates camp-dependent protein kinase . according to our previous results, cytostatic hydroxycarbamide  also induces phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase  in a pka-dependent manner  <cit> . hydroxycarbamide, as a γ-globin inducer, increases intracellular camp levels as well as cgmp levels in human erythroid progenitor cells  <cit> . fetal hemoglobin induction by hydroxycarbamide is mediated by the nitric oxide -dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase   <cit> .

g proteins also couple the receptors to other cellular effectors systems. thus, gαo has been shown to link gpcrs to ca2+ conductance channels to regulate the influx of ca2+ to cells  <cit> . hydroxycarbamide-induced rise in intracellular ca2+ demonstrates dependence on the calcium leak from endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . in addition to g proteins, gpcrs also couple with β-arrestins involved in termination of receptor activation after prolonged agonist binding  <cit> . furthermore, β-arrestins facilitate the internalization of gpcrs, followed by ubiquitination and proteasome degradation with consequential gpcr down-regulation  <cit> . we showed that hydroxycarbamide inhibited the proteasome activity, which also supports the correlation between gpcrs and globin genes control  <cit> .

several groups have examined the gene expression profile of human cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow , peripheral blood  and cord blood  using microarray technology  <cit> . the modulation of gene expression during ontogeny in fl- and cb-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells appears to overlap largely with early response genes of growth factor stimulated adult bm hematopoietic progenitor cells  <cit> . recent studies have begun to define general gene expression profiling of human erythroid cells from different origins - adult bm and pb  <cit> . in general, it has been hypothesized that globin gene switching may be mediated by proteins expressed during different stages of ontogeny.

a previous report demonstrated that stromal feeder layers of human fl, cb, and adult bm did not change hemoglobin types during erythroid differentiation of cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from the equivalent tissues  <cit> . instead of this approach, we perform erythroid differentiation of only cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells originated from fetal to adult hematopoietic cells. the erythroid cells growth and differentiation markers have been determined in in vitro liquid cultures. the γ-globin gene expression is the most increased in cb-derived erythroid cells, while beta -globin gene expression is the highest in adult blood cells  during erythroid differentiation. we compare the g proteins and gpcrs gene expression at several stages in ontogeny by array analyses. during γ-globin induction, we identify gpcrs related genes that were activated via the camp/pka, p <dig> map kinase and no/cgmp signaling pathways.

RESULTS
characterization of erythroid cell cultures
growth potential of cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells is determined by counting the viable cells. growth capacity is found to be most abundant for fl-derived cd34+ cells during erythroid differentiation. cb- and mpb-derived cd34+ cells have a higher cell growth potential than bm- and pb-derived cells during early erythroid differentiation . in the presence of epo and other cytokines, cd34+ cells are differentiated in vitro into erythroid progenitor cells, confirmed by flow cytometry analysis using four different markers: cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and glya . the transferrin receptor  is present at early erythroid cells and disappears as reticulocytes differentiate into mature erythrocytes  <cit> . at day  <dig> of erythroid cell culture, the erythroid progenitor cells are sorted as 100% cd71+, a well-known early marker of erythroid differentiation. erythroid progenitor cells from all examined cells, except from fl-derived, retain high levels of cd <dig> antigen expression . moreover, all of them and particularly erythroid cells of cb and bm origin, express cd <dig> antigen  also present at early erythroid cells . we did not find statistical significance in the percentage of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and glya antigen positive cells among erythroid progenitors derived from examined hematopoietic cells . besides flow cytometry for analysis of in vitro erythroid differentiation, we already reported measurement of hemoglobin content by benzidine staining and high-performance liquid chromatography in erythroid progenitor cells during their in vitro differentiation in the same culture conditions  <cit> .


globin genes expression during erythroid differentiation
in erythroid progenitor cells derived from pb, γ- and β-globin gene expression is initially similar, but during erythroid maturation β-globin gene expression becomes elevated in erythroid precursor cells and mature erythroid cells . we already described erythroid differentiation stages, using erythroid specific cell surface markers  <cit> . the γ-globin gene expression in erythroid cells, of fl origin, has stable expression during erythroid differentiation , whereas erythroid cells of cb demonstrate elevation . the γ-globin gene expression of adult hematopoietic progenitor-derived erythroid cells demonstrates reduction during differentiation reaching minimum at day  <dig> , while its expression was at maximum in cb-derived erythroid cells . the β-globin gene expression is almost absent in erythroid progenitors of fl origin, whereas its expression is slightly increased in erythroid cells of cb origin  and reaches maximum in cells of adult blood origin: bm  and pb  . to compare quantitative pcr results and microarray data of γ-globin gene expression, we combine them to demonstrate their expected similar tendencies during ontogeny . at day  <dig> of erythroid culture, the γ-globin gene expression is the most elevated in cb- and pb-derived erythroid progenitors, as determined by quantitative pcr. the lowest level of γ-globin gene expression is in bm-derived erythroid progenitors, as determined by microarray .


effect of hydroxycarbamide on g protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways in human erythroid progenitor cells
it has been reported that hydroxycarbamide, a γ-globin inducer, activated p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  and c-jun expression  <cit> . since these pathways are also activated by gpcrs, we are interested to determine additional related pathways in pb-derived erythroid progenitor cells in a steady state and after incubation with hydroxycarbamide using gpcrs signaling pathway finder gene array at day  <dig> of erythroid culture . in the steady state, we find elevated gene expression of drd <dig>  s1pr <dig>  ptgdr and ptger <dig> in human erythroid progenitor cells . we also find increase in gene expression activated by the camp/pka pathway , pkc pathway , mapk pathway , no-cgmp pathway  and jak-stat pathway . hsp90aa <dig> has the steady upregulated levels during ontogeny in erythroid cells, as well as hspa <dig> and ywhaz gene expression . hydroxycarbamide treatment of erythroid progenitor cells induces the statistically significant expression of following gpcrs: ptgdr , and ptger <dig> genes . hydroxycarbamide also stimulates gene expression activated by camp/pka pathway , no/cgmp pathway , mapk pathway  and jak-stat pathway . hydroxycarbamide increases γ-globin gene expression up to  <dig>  fold in erythroid progenitor cells used for gpcrs gene array, as measured by real-time quantitative pcr  <cit> . gene expression of il <dig>  upregulated by hydroxycarbamide, is also elevated in erythroid cells during ontogeny and more prominent in bm tissue, as determined by microarray analysis .

g-protein related genes in erythroid progenitor cells during ontogenesis
the g protein superfamily consists of heterotrimeric complexes of distinct α-, β-, and γ-subunits. heterotrimeric g proteins are classified according to α subunit into four subfamilies: gs, gi, gq, and g12/ <dig> <cit> . to distinguish significant g proteins and gpcrs during erythropoiesis we performed microarray analysis of erythroid progenitor cells in certain stages of human ontogeny. during microarray analysis the genes are upregulated or downregulated versus reference huurna, what we use as a control alongside each sample. g-protein related genes: gnai <dig> and gnb <dig> are continuously downregulated vs. gnb2l <dig> upregulation during ontogeny . gnai <dig> gene expression was prominently upregulated in bm- and mpb-derived cells, but downregulated in fl-derived cells. steady upregulation also demonstrates gnl <dig> and gnl <dig> genes. the increased gng <dig> and grk <dig> gene expression is observed in bm-derived cells , with elevated β-globin gene expression . the expression of gnaq gene is significantly increased only in erythroid progenitors of mpb origin. in addition, gpcrs genes: gpr <dig> gene has decreased gene expression only in bm-, whereas gpr <dig> only in pb-derived cells. gpr <dig> gene has elevated expression in erythroid cells of fl origin, whereas gpr <dig> has decreased expression in bm-derived cells, opposite to gpr <dig> and gpr172a genes. in addition, β-arrestins are involved in termination of gpcrs activation after prolonged agonist binding  <cit> . arrdc <dig> gene expression is the most upregulated in fl- and downregulated only in mpb-derived cells, whereas arrdc <dig> expression is decreased in all examined erythroid progenitors except of bm origin . the microarray data discussed in this publication we deposited in ncbi’s geo database and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> .


discussion
to reveal the essential mechanisms in erythropoiesis several studies have performed gene expression profiling in erythroid cells from hematopoietic tissues through ontogeny. the findings in these reports are heterogeneous, reflecting the variation in the experimental systems used. by choosing early erythroid progenitors differentiated from purified cd34+ cells, we extend those studies to evaluate globin gene expression in correlation to gpcr-coupled genes from fetal to adult erythropoiesis. the γ-globin gene expression is most prominent in cb-derived erythroid progenitors, whereas β-globin gene expression is major in adult blood-derived , low in cb-derived and almost completely absent in fl-derived erythroid progenitors. the gpcr-coupled genes have been studied in erythroid progenitor cells during stimulation of γ-globin gene production. hydroxycarbamide stimulates the expression of several genes  activated by gpcrs via camp/pka, p <dig> mapk, and no/cgmp signaling pathways. a certain number of g-proteins  and gpcrs demonstrate variation or stability of gene expression in erythroid progenitor cells during ontogeny. genes gpr <dig> and arrdc <dig> have the most prominent expression in fl-derived, genes gnl <dig> and grp <dig> in cb-derived , gnl <dig>  gpr <dig>  arrdc <dig> and gng <dig> in bm-derived , gnaq, gna <dig> and gpr <dig> in mpb-derived, gpr89c and gpr172a in pb-derived erythroid progenitors.

as previously reported, g protein expression and mapks are involved in hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, another γ-globin stimulator  <cit> . hydroxycarbamide increased phosphorylation of p <dig> in erythroid differentiation  <cit> . in accordance with hydroxycarbamide and g protein linked activity, gα12/ <dig> also induced activation of p <dig> mapk   <cit> . it has been revealed that the p <dig> activation resulted in the stimulation of nf-kappab-specific dna-protein binding and the subsequent expression of inducible nos and no release  <cit> . moreover, g protein α <dig>  stimulation of the enos protein expression is in accordance with hydroxycarbamide induction of enos protein levels   <cit> . we have previously shown that fetal hemoglobin stimulation, by hydroxycarbamide, is dependent on no/cgmp signaling pathway in erythroid progenitor cells  <cit> . in addition, the activated g protein α <dig>  induced the nf-kappab accompanied by augmented secretion of il- <dig>   <cit> . induced expression of il- <dig>  hspa <dig>  serpine <dig> and jun by hydroxycarbamide, achieved in our experiments, is also observed upon hemin-induced erythroid differentiation  <cit> . it has been reported that hydroxycarbamide increased jun gene and protein expression in erythroid cells, by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the mrna  <cit> . initial epo-dependent junb induction was not sufficient, but the late epo-independent junb expression was necessary for differentiation of primary erythroid cells  <cit> . gna <dig> gene expression has been elevated in erythropoiesis throughout ontogeny, while gna <dig> gene expression is prominent in erythroid progenitors of adult cells origin .


the g-protein α <dig>  is expressed particularly in hematopoietic cells  <cit> . beta 2-adrenergic receptor , induced by hydroxycarbamide, can specifically couple to gna <dig> upregulated in erythroid progenitors of cb and adult cells origin in our microarray study  <cit> . it has been reported that calcium-sensing receptor-mediated map kinase  activation requires gnai <dig> coupling  <cit> . inhibition of the erk pathway lead to increased hemoglobin levels  <cit> . furthermore, according to our results gnai <dig> gene expression is decreased in every examined erythroid progenitors. the activation of p <dig> mapk signaling pathway, induced by gna12/ <dig>  is also involved in butyrate-mediated erythroid differentiation, another γ-globin inducer as well as inhibitor of histone deacetylases  <cit> . additionally, the inhibition of histone deacetylases induced a high increase of γ-globin mrna and activated p <dig> signaling during fetal hemoglobin stimulation  <cit> .

we show that hydroxycarbamide stimulates gpcrs ptgdr and ptger <dig> gene expression. the activity of ptgdr receptor is mediated by gαs proteins that stimulate adenylate cyclase resulting in an elevation of intracellular camp and ca2+, while ptger <dig> mediates activity through gαq proteins that stimulate phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system   <cit> . it has been reported that expression of the γ-globin gene is induced upon activation of the camp pathway, while adenylate cyclase inhibition markedly decreased fetal hemoglobin induction by hydroxycarbamide in human erythroid cells  <cit> . hydroxycarbamide increased intracellular cgmp as well as camp levels in human erythroid progenitors, while camp consecutively stimulates pka  <cit> . phosphorylation of enos at ser <dig> by hydroxycarbamide was completely pka dependent, accompanied by a rise of the intracellular ca2+ concentration  <cit> . besides phosphorylation, enos production of no is also stimulated by increased intracellular ca2+ levels and interaction with calmodulin . we demonstrated that no increased γ-globin gene expression in human erythroid cells during differentiation. in addition, inhibition of sgc prevents no and hydroxycarbamide stimulation of γ-globin gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, sgc activators or cgmp analogs augmented γ-globin gene expression in primary human erythroblasts  <cit> . the no–cgmp pathway is known to increase jun mrna levels  <cit> . we show that hydroxycarbamide increases gpcr-coupled jun gene expression, which is in accordance with previous studies related to induction of jun and γ-globin gene expression   <cit> . it has been also postulated that jun activates the gγ-globin promoter via an upstream camp response element  in a way comparable to transcription factor cre binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . creb <dig>  a key transcription factor in erythropoiesis, was down-regulated in gpr48−/− fetal livers through the camp-pka-creb pathway, with decreased adult hemoglobin α and β chains  <cit> . there have been previous reports of p <dig> mapk increased phosphorylation by both no and cgmp  <cit> . hydroxycarbamide also augmented phosphorylation of p <dig>  and demonstrated dependence of p <dig> activity during stimulation of fetal hemoglobin production  <cit> . finally, the creb <dig> activated γ-globin expression via p <dig> mapk signaling in erythroid progenitors  <cit> . this observation emphasizes the mutual stimulation of gpcrs and no/cgmp pathway, via jun and p <dig> mapk signaling, in activation of γ-globin expression .


CONCLUSIONS
while mechanisms involved in globin gene expression have been recognized at different levels within the regulatory hierarchy, relations among these molecular pathways are only emerging. we associate our new results with the no/cgmp pathway described in our previous publications  <cit> , and demonstrate the induction of g-proteins and gpcr-coupled genes during γ-globin stimulation and erythropoiesis through ontogeny. these genes and related signaling pathways, involved in the mechanism of globin activation, might be targets for the therapeutic agents to upregulate γ-globin gene expression and fetal hemoglobin levels in hemoglobinopathies. therefore, further direct studies are required to confirm that modifications in the level of expression of gpcrs lead to significant changes in no/cgmp and other signaling pathways important for γ-globin gene expression in erythroid cells.
