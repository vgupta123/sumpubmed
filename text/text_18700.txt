BACKGROUND
animal mitochondrial dna  is nearly always a closed circular molecule and, with a few exceptions , contains the same  <dig> genes, specifying  <dig> proteins, two ribosomal rnas, and  <dig> trnas  <cit> . sequences of these diminutive genomes have been broadly used to address phylogenetic questions ranging from the population  <cit>  to the interphylum  <cit>  levels and to model many processes of genome evolution  <cit> . although there are exceptions, most mtdnas contain no introns and are between  <dig> and  <dig> kb. typically there are few intergenic nucleotides except for a single large non-coding region generally thought to contain elements that regulate replication and transcription  <cit> . occasionally non-coding regions have been found that contain repeated elements  <cit>  or contain pseudogenes  <cit>  or that may be remnants of duplicated regions, perhaps those that mediate gene rearrangements  <cit> . gene rearrangements tend to be uncommon and to occur in a saltatory manner . the "universal" genetic code has been modified in many animal lineages, to include the use of alternative start codons and abbreviated stop codons  <cit> . in some mtdnas there is pronounced skew in nucleotide composition, often with one strand being rich in g and t and the other in a and c  <cit> . post-transcriptional modification of nucleotides has been observed for trnas  <cit> .

little study has been done to date on mollusk mtdnas compared to those of vertebrates or arthropods  <cit> , but it is already apparent that mollusks exhibit much variation in the features of their mitochondrial genomes, including losses and gains of genes  <cit> , atypically large amounts of duplicated or non-coding nucleotides  <cit> , highly rearranged genomes  <cit> , and an unusual pattern of passage termed doubly uniparental inheritance  <cit> . this is furthered here by reporting and comparing the features of the mitochondrial genome of the first nautiloid to be so studied, n. macromphalus .

nautiloids were once abundant and diverse in the paleozoic seas, but only a handful of species remain. they are part of the molluscan class cephalopoda, which otherwise contains octopi, squid, and cuttlefish. they are the earliest diverging lineage of this group and are often considered to be "living fossils" since living forms seem to have changed little from their ancient ancestors. they live in spiral-shaped shells which are filled with gas to control buoyancy and they move about by squirting jets of water. they are carnivorous, using their many grooved tentacles to grasp prey and pass it to their mouth, where a beak-like jaw tears it and passes it to the shredding radula. they live throughout the southwest pacific ocean, at depths as great as  <dig> meters, and traverse a great range, as shallow as  <dig> meters, apparently in search of prey.

complete mtdna sequences have been determined for  <dig> mollusks , including a representative   <cit>  of a basal group . this sampling includes seven other cephalopods: octopus vulgaris  <cit> , loligo bleekeri  <cit> , todarodes pacificus  <cit> , o. ocellatus, sepioteuthis lessoniana, watasenia scintillans, and sepia officinalis  <cit> . comparisons of the features of the n. macromphalus mtdna with those of some other mollusks are presented here.

RESULTS
gene content and organization
complete mtdna sequences have been determined  <dig> mollusks. the nautilus macromphalus  mitochondrial genome is  <dig>  bp in length  and contains the set of  <dig> genes most commonly found for animal mtdnas  <cit> . fifteen genes are located on one strand and  <dig> on the other . there are several substantial non-coding regions , the largest of which is  <dig> nts long and between trnq and trnt.

the mitochondrial gene arrangement of the distantly related katharina tunicata  <cit>   differs from that of another studied cephalopod, octopus vulgaris  <cit> , by only the inversion of trnp and a transposition of trnd, and differs from that of n. macromphalus by these changes plus additional transpositions of trnf and trnt and the switch in position of two large blocks of genes . therefore, each of these lineages has experienced very few gene rearrangements over several hundreds of millions of years. in order to determine which of these differences were caused by changes in the lineage leading to polyphacophora versus those leading to the cephalopods, it is useful to identify more distantly related animals that share one or the other arrangement; since it seems very unlikely that identical rearrangements would occur in different lineages, one can reasonably infer that any gene arrangement shared by this outgroup taxon with either the polyplacophoran or a cephalopod is the ancestral condition for the common ancestor of the latter two groups. in this regard, the mitochondrial gene arrangement of a distantly related animal, the phoronid phoronis architecta  <cit> , is very useful since it has little diverged since these groups separated. from this comparison , we can see that one of these trnas, trnd, remains in the ancestral condition in these two cephalopods, with the transposition having occurred in the polyplacophoran, whereas all other changes are derived for the cephalopods from that order parsimoniously inferred to be basal for the mollusca.

in total, there are now available complete mtdna sequences from eight cephalopod species to compare. in addition to n. macromphalus and o. vulgaris, these are the squids loligo bleekeri  <cit> , todarodes pacificus  <cit> , watasenia scintillans  <cit> , and sepioteuthis lessoniana  <cit> , the octopus o. ocellatus  <cit> , and the cuttlefish sepia officinalis  <cit> . o. ocellatus shares an identical gene arrangement with o. vulgaris. two of the squids, l. bleekeri and s. lessoniana, share a nearly identical gene arrangement . this gene arrangement, plus another separately rearranged in s. officinalis, are highly derived and each shares only a few blocks of colinearity with the more conserved gene order of n. macromphalus mtdna. all of these cephalopod mtdnas have the same gene content except for w. scintillans and t. pacificus, the two representatives of the group oegopsida. these two mtdnas have a nearly identical gene arrangement, differing only in the position of trnm, that is highly rearranged from those of other mollusks, and contain duplicated copies of cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  atp <dig>  atp <dig>  and trnd, such that they contain genes for a total of  <dig> proteins,  <dig> rrnas, and  <dig> trnas. in all of these studied cephalopod mtdnas, all genes retain the same transcriptional orientation, that is, all rearrangements are transpositions and none are inversions. akasaki et al.  <cit>  provide a comprehensive and well reasoned review of this pattern of arrangements, including proposals for mechanism of rearrangement, the role of the many large, non-coding regions, and evidence for concerted evolution of duplicated genes.

gene initiation and termination
mitochondrial genomes often use a variety of non-standard initiation codons  <cit> , but n. macromphalus mtdna has only one type of deviation; three genes  start with gtg and all others use the standard atg . seven genes have unambiguous termination codons, either tag  or taa . in four cases  genes are probably abbreviated to a single t or to ta such that the excision of the adjacent, downstream trna from the polycistronic message leaves an mrna that is polyadenylated to complete a taa stop codon. however, in each of these cases, a complete stop codon is available if there is, alternatively, overlap of only one or two nucleotides with the downstream trna. perhaps these act as a "backup" for cases where translation precedes message cleavage. the other two cases are more ambiguous. nad4l could have an abbreviated stop codon, but is inferred to overlap nad <dig> by seven nucleotides to the first legitimate stop codon, since overlap of this pair has been commonly observed for other mtdnas, where they are thought to be translated as a bicistron. nad <dig> is inferred to overlap cob by eight nucleotides, perhaps suggesting that these are processed also as a bicistron, but could instead end on an abbreviated stop codon if there were some signal for message cleavage  that we do not recognize. inferred in this way, all protein-encoding genes have lengths nearly identical to those of k. tunicata mtdna .

transfer rnas
sequences were identified whose potential secondary structures indicate that they encode the  <dig> trnas typically found for animal mtdna . in general, these appear well paired with only a few mismatches.

there are three cases where trna genes appear to overlap, and these potential structures suggest how this is resolved. trnl <dig> appears to overlap trnl <dig> by only the former's discriminator nucleotide . trnq appears to overlap trnw by two nucleotides. trnk appears to overlap trna by four nucleotides, ggct. these are well-paired in the potential structure of trna, but these four correspond to two g-t pairs, one mismatch, and the discriminator nucleotide of trna. it appears for each case that cleavage to form a complete downstream trna followed by adenylation of the upstream trna  would yield fully formed, well-paired structures for all. this is illustrated in figure  <dig> by lower case, parenthetical letter "a" appended to the genome-encoded nucleotide to indicate likely nucleotides in the actual transcript.

usually t is in the first anticodon position for trnas that recognize either four-fold degenerate codon families or to specifically recognize nnr codons; g is usually in this position only to specifically recognize nny codons.  all but two of the n. macromphalus mitochondrial trnas follow this pattern. one exception is trna, which has the anticodon cat , as is almost universally the case for all animal mitochondrial systems. in some cases the c is known to be post-transcriptionally modified to 5-formylcytidine to enable the necessary pairing with the ata codon  <cit> . however, it is less common that the trna expected to recognize codon agn has a gct anticodon, since this requires the g to pair with all four nucleotides in the wobble position of agn codons. it is clear the aga and agg codons are being used and are not stop codons , since they appear in the reading frames of protein encoding genes  <dig> times. gct is used as the trna anticodon for all of the cephalopods with complete mtdna sequences , and it is likely that this anticodon is modified post-transcriptionally for all, as is known to occur for the loligo bleekeri trna, for which the g is modified to 7-methylguanosine  <cit> .

non-coding regions
the mtdna of n. macromphalus has  <dig>  nucleotides that are not assigned to genes. this is not an unusually large number, but it is atypical that they are distributed among so many regions of the genome . it is particularly unusual to find this in a mitochondrial genome that has not undergone significant rearrangements, since intergenic non-coding regions appear in some cases to be vestiges of pseudogenes generated by the gene duplication-random loss process of rearrangement  <cit> .

in the largest non-coding region, between trnq and trnt, and beginning adjacent to a  <dig> run , there are six repeats of a  <dig> nucleotide element followed by a partial repeat of  <dig> nucleotides. within this are five overlapping regions that have potential for forming trna-like structures . the anticodon portion of these structures is agt, which would pair with codon act  to specify threonine. however, having a in this anticodon position would be very unusual and there is little sequence similarity to trnt .

tandem repeats of ca are common, with  <dig> in each of the intergenic regions of trna-trnr and trng-atp <dig> and an especially noteworthy  <dig> in the region between trnq and trnt. homopolymer runs of t <dig>  nine c <dig>  and a <dig> are in the regions trnq-trnt, trng-atp <dig>  and trne-cox <dig>  respectively. non-coding, non-functional portions of mtdna are generally eliminated rapidly  <cit> , presumably due to selection for small size at the point of entry into the primordial germ plasm during embryogenesis  <cit> , but whether these or any particular motif plays any role in regulating replication of transcription awaits experimentation.

base composition and codon usage
the n. macromphalus mtdna is  <dig> % a+t. the strand that includes cox <dig>  which we will arbitrarily designate as the plus strand for the purpose of discussion, is  <dig> % a,  <dig> % t,  <dig> % g, and  <dig> % c. this strand is strongly skewed  away from both t  and g  in favor of a and c . as can be seen in table  <dig>  this is strongly reflected in the use of synonymous codons. for example, while ttt and ttc are used with approximately equal frequency to specify phenylalanine in plus-strand genes, the bias is  <dig> to  <dig> for their usage in minus-strand genes. the use of g vs. a in uur  codons is in the ratio of  <dig> to  <dig> for plus-strand genes but, even though the mtdna is a+t-rich, it is  <dig> to  <dig> for minus-strand genes. presumably the biased use of synonymous codons is driven by strand-specific mutational propensity.

the minus-strand genes of n. macromphalus are organized into three blocks: trne through nad5; trng individually; and trnq through trnf. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  each of these is flanked by non-coding regions at least  <dig> nucleotides in length  and the two largest are delimited by sharp transitions in the ratio of a+c to g+t between the strands, with a strong bias toward a+c in the reported strand for these three regions. that bias is weaker for the region that is predominantly composed of the ribosomal rna genes, perhaps because of the requirement for base pairing in the secondary structures of the products. there is no significant bias for the plus-strand genes.

the mitochondrial genome of the chiton, k. tunicata, contrasts with this. although the gene arrangement is quite similar, here the pattern of bias is opposite in two different respects. first, it is the plus-strand genes that have strong skew in nucleotide composition, with the minus-strand genes being nearly neutral for this bias. secondly, the bias for these is strongly toward g+t for the reported strand. here again, the sharp transitions in base composition are flanked by non-coding regions at least  <dig> nucleotides in length, which could potentially serve as signaling elements for transcription or replication.

such skews with one strand being rich in a+c and the other rich in g+t are common for mitochondrial genomes  <cit> .  this is thought to be due predominantly to the commonality of deamination of adenine and cytosine nucleotides in single-stranded dna  <cit>  which appears transiently during replication and transcription. the relative contribution of these two processes remains unclear  <cit> , as each accounts for one strand being displaced by the nascent dna or rna, respectively. . deaminated adenine forms hypoxanthine, which pairs with cytosine  and deaminated cytosine forms uracil, which pairs with adenine . therefore, the displaced strand, existing in single-stranded form for sometimes protracted periods, tends to become rich in g+t  and its complementary strand, therefore, becomes rich in a+c.

since n. macromphalus and k. tunicata mtdnas each have sharp boundaries in base compositional bias that correspond so precisely to shifts in transcriptional orientation, it appears that lesions in the displaced strand during transcription are an important contribution. on the other hand, the contrast in the bias being strong for the minus-strand genes of n. macromphalus and for the plus-strand genes of k. tunicata shows that some other factor must be at work.

according to the more long-standing and broadly accepted model of mtdna replication  <cit>  , and demonstrated for the few cases where it has been studied, replication of mtdna is very slow and very asymmetrical, with one strand in single stranded form for a protracted period, so this may be an important factor in strand compositional bias. the nucleotide skew between the two mitochondrial strands is expected to be a combination of various factors, and one could imagine a model whereby a reversal between n. macromphalus and k. tunicata in which strand is leading during replication could account for their differing skew patterns. if replication in k. tunicata mtdna were to proceed first in the rightward direction according to figure  <dig>  then the bias introduced during replication would make the reported strand rich in g+t. this would be reinforced by biases introduced during transcription in the regions of the plus-strand genes, causing especially high bias, and countered by the biases introduced during transcription in the regions of the minus-strand genes, causing them to approximately cancel out. if n. macromphalus mtdna replication were to proceed in the opposite direction, right-to-left as in figure  <dig>  then the effect would be the opposite, with skew generated by mutational bias during replication reinforcing that from transcription of minus-strand genes and opposing that from transcription of plus-strand genes, and accounting for the patterns shown in figure  <dig> 

it is not clear whether the isolated trng is transcribed individually or is part of the transcription unit that otherwise ends at nad <dig>  separating trng and nad <dig> is a single plus-strand gene, atp <dig>  and it is possible that this is transcribed in reverse as part of the larger transcription unit, with this antisense message excised and degraded. when considering only the composition of the third positions of four-fold degenerate codon families, g and t comprise  <dig>  and  <dig>  of atp <dig>  values nearly identical to  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the other plus-strand genes collectively. however, a and c are  <dig>  and  <dig>  for atp <dig> vs.  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for the other plus-strand genes. perhaps this indicates a modifying force for mutational bias, perhaps the regular reverse transcription of the gene. on the other hand, trng is flanked by large blocks of non-coding sequence which could potentially be signals for initiating and terminating transcription for this individual gene.

potential signaling elements
an attempt was made to find potential regulatory sequence elements by comparing all pairs of non-coding regions that are greater than  <dig> nucleotides in length  for any blocks  <dig> nucleotides or longer with identity at least 80% while considering both strands. in addition to the homopolymer runs and dinucleotide repeats discussed above and underlined in additional file  <dig>  three elements were identified, all associated with reversals in transcriptional orientation. in the largest non-coding region between the oppositely oriented trnq and trnt is the sequence ttaaaacaa, also found in the region between atp <dig> and nad <dig>  although both are at a point where transcriptional orientation reverses, the first case is of genes arranged head-to-head but the second of genes tail-to-tail. also in the trnq-trnt region is the sequence ccnatttta which is also found in the region between trnt and trng; again in the first case the genes are head-to-head and in the second tail-to-tail. the sequence ataacaaaacta occurs in the region between trne and cox <dig> and also between trng and atp <dig>  in each case pairs of genes arranged head-to-head.  none of these sequences are present in k. tunicata mtdna and none are present in the non-coding regions of any of the other studied cephalopods.

a comparison was also made between each non-coding region of n. macromphalus and each non-coding region of all of the other cephalopod mtdnas greater than  <dig> nucleotides in length for any blocks of length  <dig> or greater matching at least 70%. although some matches were found, none were consistent across all  species. lastly, a search was made for all available cephalopod mtdnas for long stretches of alternating ca or ta, suggested to play a role in regulation of replication and/or transcription. of note is that n. macromphalus has several regions of alternating ca , the longest of which is  <dig>  only two of the other cephalopods, l. bleekeri and t. pacificus have any as long as  <dig>  in contrast, while n. macromphalus has no regions of alternating ta longer than  <dig> , each of the other cephalopods has many such regions at least of length  <dig> , and some as long as  <dig> .  <dig>  for o. ocellatus is  <dig>  and for both s. officinalis and o. vulgaris is  <dig> ) of course, it is possible that actual regulatory elements may be more complex and difficult to identify.

CONCLUSIONS
to date, complete mtdna sequences had been determined for  <dig> mollusks, a very small sampling compared to those available for vertebrates or arthropods  <cit> . even these few studies have revealed that mollusks' mtdnas have much variation in their features, including losses and gains of genes  <cit> , unusually large amounts of duplicated or non-coding nucleotides  <cit> , numerous gene rearrangements  <cit> , and doubly uniparental inheritance  <cit> . by contrast, the mtdna of the cephalopod nautilus macromphalus is fairly typical in many respects, with a size, gene content, and a+t-richness similar to those most common for animal mtdnas. there have been only a few gene arrangements in this lineage even since its divergence from the basal mollusk group polyplacophora, and these rearrangements can be confidently polarized among the two lineages by comparing them to mtdnas of less related animals.

there is strong skew in the distribution of nucleotides between the two strands and it appears that biases in mutational spectrum during both transcription and replication are responsible for this. compared with most animal mtdnas, there are a large number of non-coding regions. although their functions, if any, are not known, the fact that several are at positions of abrupt shift in nucleotide skew and that some contain identical sequence elements suggests that they may contain regulatory signals for transcription and/or replication. this appears to be another example where polyadenylation of trnas creates part of the amino-acyl acceptor stem. these, and other features can be interpreted in detail for the systems of these diminutive genomes, and further sampling of complete mtdna sequences across the tree of life promises to provide insights into general aspects of genome evolution.
