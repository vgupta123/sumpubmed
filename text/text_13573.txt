BACKGROUND
genome decoding fidelity is essential to maintain cell homeostasis and fitness in all organisms. however, errors in dna transcription, pre-mrna splicing and editing, and in mrna translation, generate mutant proteins whose toxicity creates homeostatic imbalances . at the gene translation level, missense, nonsense, frameshifting and ribosome drop-off errors affect protein synthesis  <cit> . missense errors arise from incorrect trna selection by the ribosome or incorrect trna aminoacylation by aminoacyl-trna synthetases  and occur with average frequency of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> per codon decoded  <cit> . such errors are codon-dependent and are sensitive to the nutritional status of the cell  <cit> . translational frameshifting errors occur at a frequency of 10- <dig> and are caused by trna slippage during mrna decoding  <cit> , while read-through of stop codons  results from competition between non-sense suppressor trnas and release factors  and occur at a frequency of 10- <dig>  <cit> . ribosome drop-off errors are poorly understood but have a basal frequency of  <dig> × 10- <dig> at ribosome pausing sites  <cit> .

eukaryotic cells mitigate the deleterious effects of those gene expression infidelities through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , autophagy, er-associated protein degradation pathway  and molecular chaperones  <cit> . despite this, mutations that affect protein synthesis efficiency and/or accuracy cause neurodegenerative disease in mice and various human diseases, including mitochondrial diseases and cancer . for example, a single mutation in the editing domain of the mouse alanyl-trna synthetase  leads to serine  misincorporation at alanine  codons and causes rapid loss of purkinje cells  <cit> , while mischarging of the trnamet with homocysteine  causes proteome n-homocysteinylation in vascular endothelial cells  and increases the risk of vascular disease in humans  <cit> . moreover, reactive oxygen species  modify phenylalanine  to m-tyrosine , o-tyrosine  and p-tyrosine  and promote m-tyr misincorporation into proteins by both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial phenylalanyl-trna synthetases  via mischarging of trnaphe , but the consequences of proteome m-tyrosylation are not known  <cit> . similarly, mutations in mitochondrial tdna genes encoding trnaphe, trnaleu, trnaser, trnahis and trnalys, which affect the accuracy and/or efficiency of translation, cause myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes or myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers   <cit> , indicating that mitochondria are particularly sensitive to gene translation fidelity and efficiency.

most surprisingly, elevated gene translational errors  can trigger expression of advantageous phenotypes in yeast and bacteria  <cit> . for example, misincorporation of ser at leu cug codons allows yeast to grow in the presence of high concentrations of arsenite, cadmium, cycloheximide, nacl and h2o <dig>  <cit> , while natural epigenetic control of both stop codon read-through and antizyme frameshifting by the  prion generates phenotypic diversity and regulates the cellular concentration of polyamines  <cit> . in the fungal pathogen candida albicans such mistranslations generate extensive phenotypic diversity, induce expression of novel colony and cell morphotypes and are associated with evolution of a genetic code alteration  <cit> .

mistranslations are also used to synthesise statistical proteins of high potential to generate antigenic variation in mycoplasma species which encode threonyl-, phenylayl- and leucyl-trna synthetases  with defective amino acid editing domains  <cit> . in e. coli, mistranslations induce a hypermutagenic phenotype known as translational stress mutagenesis   <cit> , raising the fascinating hypothesis that phenotypic outcomes of gene translational errors can be rapidly fixed in the genome. we unveil below hidden features of the biology of genome translational infidelities which help us understand some of the phenotypes described above.

RESULTS
model system to study gene mistranslations in a controlled manner
gene mistranslations have been studied over the years using the aminoglycosidic antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin, ribostamycin and paromomycin and nonsense or missense suppressor trnas  <cit> . these studies helped in the understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic action and mrna decoding by the ribosome, but failed to unveil positive and degenerative roles of mistranslations, which are fundamental to fully understanding the biology of gene translational errors. in order to overcome these limitations, we have engineered regulated codon misreading in yeast using a trnacagser  that misreads leucine cug codons as ser . since the yeast genome contains  <dig>  cug codons distributed over  <dig> % of its genes, the mutant trnacagser misincorporates ser on a proteome-wide scale  <cit> , providing an ideal system to study global effects of gene mistranslations. in order to regulate these mistranslations, the trnacagser was expressed under the control of the e. coli tet operator  - tet repressor protein  system  <cit> . tetr expression was driven by the yeast gal <dig> promoter in medium containing galactose  as the sole carbon source . addition of tetracycline to this growth medium inhibits the tetr protein allosterically, clears teto and activates transcription of the mutant trnacagser.

since biologically and biomedically relevant gene mistranslations occur at levels that do not compromise cell viability, we have attempted to determine the mistranslations' induction time and intensity thresholds that produced minimal impact on growth rate. expression of the trnacagser could be induced with  <dig> μg/ml of tetracycline at an od <dig> of  <dig>  to  <dig>  without significant alteration in growth rate, small differences were visible in stationary phase only . earlier induction of the trna  resulted in higher reduction of cell density in stationary phase and slowed growth of cells diluted into fresh medium . putting it simply, gene mistranslations remained phenotypically silent during the first three to four yeast generations but their negative effects increased in intensity over time, as one would predict from gradual accumulation of the mistranslating trna. when cells expressing the trnacagser were spotted in mmgalactose agar plates, a decrease in viability or ability to re-grow and form colonies was observed. this effect was stronger when a higher concentration of tetracyclin was used . a similar result was observed when control and teto-trna cells pre-cultured in mmgalactose were directly plated in mmgalactose + tetracycline agar plates , indicating that mistranslations become degenerative overtime.

in order to confirm the misreading activity of the trnacagser, we have co-expressed the e. coli β-galactosidase  and the trnacagser genes in the same recombinant cells. the e. coli lacz gene contains  <dig> cug codons and misincorporation of ser at these leu-codons generates a combinatorial array of mutant β-gal molecules  whose altered stability can be quantified using thermal denaturation and aggregation assays  <cit> . the high number of cug codons present in the lacz gene combined with the different chemical properties of ser  and leu  make β-gal a highly sensitive reporter, allowing for monitoring low level misreading activity of the trnacagser. as expected, ser misincorporation at cugs decreased the cellular concentration of β-gal  and a thermal denaturation assay  <cit>  showed decreased β-gal activity after heat denaturation and refolding  . mistranslated β-gal also had higher propensity to aggregate , confirming previous data on the role of gene mistranslations on protein aggregation  <cit> . we have attempted to quantify the expression of the trnacagser by northern blot analysis but we were unable to do so. this was consistent, however, with our previous quantitative mass-spectrometry studies which showed that constitutive expression of the trnacagser in yeast leads to  <dig> % misincorporation of ser at leu cug positions, but the trna was very difficult to detect by northern blot analysis  <cit> .

general features of the transcriptional response to gene mistranslations
the transcriptional response to gene mistranslations was investigated by profiling the transcriptome of yeast cells at the mistranslations time points of t0', t40', t60', t90', t120' and t180'. the global gene expression deregulation pattern  was consistent with induction of the yeast environmental stress response   <cit> . mistranslating cells shared  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes  with the control cells exposed to environmental stressors and deregulated  <dig> genes, which were not found in the esr gene list  <cit>  , after moderated t-tests with p-value cut-off  <dig>  after multiple testing correction. gene enrichment analysis using gene ontology  terms confirmed that genes belonging to oxidative and general stress, carbohydrate and energy reserve metabolism, protein folding and sulphur metabolism were up-regulated, while genes encoding translational factors, ribosome biogenesis and assembly were down-regulated . genes encoding ribosomal proteins were weakly down-regulated up to t90', but a strong down-regulation effect was observed at t180'. in contrast, up-regulation of molecular chaperones and trehalose biosynthesis genes was clearly visible at t40' . the initial response  to gene mistranslations also involved up-regulation of translation and metabolic processes, but their deregulation changed from positive to negative over time . a cross comparison of deregulated genes  using go terms enrichment confirmed the negative effect of mistranslations on the protein synthesis machinery and highlighted important similarities with the esr . during the initial stages of mistranslations  degs shared with the esr were essentially up-regulated, while at t120' and t180' common up- and down-regulated degs were detected . this indicates that molecular chaperones and other stress genes were the first line of defense against the gene mistranslations while down-regulation of protein synthesis genes happened later .

for each of the time-point degs, a hypergeometric test was applied over each go biological process , selecting go terms with p-value lower than 10- <dig>  the go terms considered for mistranslations are either enriched for four or more time points, or have a significance level below a p-value of 10- <dig> for a single time point. this method provides about  <dig> go terms that, after manually removing redundant and generic terms, result into the terms displayed in table  <dig> 

a cross stress analysis of degs further supported the similarities between the stress responses induced by mistranslations and environmental stressors . go terms enrichment analysis showed that genes involved in vacuolar catabolic processes, heat and general stress, response to toxin, regulation of metabolic processes and vacuolar processes were up-regulated . mistranslations had a strong positive impact on the expression of genes encoding small molecular chaperones, namely hsp <dig> , hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> , which bind aggregated proteins and help in their disaggregation by hsp <dig> ssa <dig>  or ssa <dig> , hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  . this supported our observation  and studies from other laboratories showing that gene mistranslations are an important source of protein misfolding and aggregation  <cit> . genes encoding proteins involved in metabolic pathways , synthesis of osmolites, energy reserve and protein stabilization metabolites , ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , nad metabolism , cell wall remodelling  and the regulator of the m7g-oligoribonucleotide metabolism , were also up-regulated . the latter inhibits the hydrolase involved in mrna decapping  and is regulated by msn2/4p and the ras-camp-pka signalling pathway, suggesting that cap-dependent translation initiation may be strengthened under mistranslations and that part of the transcriptional response to proteotoxic stress is likely modulated by the ras-pka signalling pathway  <cit> .

the cross stress comparison of the complete set of degs corroborated and highlighted the generalized down-regulation of the protein synthesis machinery, in particular of genes encoding translation factors, rna binding and processing proteins, regulation of translational fidelity, ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis and assembly genes . it also showed down-regulation of chaperones linked to the ribosome , which fold newly synthesized proteins emerging from it . these clips included hsp70s ssb <dig>  the hsp <dig> partners ssz <dig> and zuo <dig>  the chaperonin tric/ccts  and members of the prefoldin gimc protein family , suggesting that down-regulation of the protein synthesis machinery exacerbates protein folding problems caused by gene mistranslations.

gene mistranslations affect protein synthesis
the generalized down-regulation of protein synthesis genes without clear effects on yeast growth rate prompted us to validate the expression of several ribosomal protein genes by rt-qpcr, but the latter confirmed the down-regulation trend detected by the dna microarrays . in order to determine whether the gene expression deregulation had direct impact on protein synthesis, we have also pulse-labelled control and mistranslating cells with -leu and analysed their polysome profiles . reduced protein synthesis and polysome levels were detected   and the latter were altered as early as t40', suggesting that down-regulation of protein synthesis accompanied the early up-regulation of the molecular chaperones mentioned above. the t40'and t90' profiles did not show increased levels of monosomes or free ribosomal subunits, indicated by similar p:p+m ratios of control and teto-trna cells at each time point. the reduction of 60% of total p+m material in teto-trna cells relative to control cells at t90' suggests that the subunits released from the polysomes were degraded or may have been incorporated into p-bodies or stress granules. the loss of translational material at t90'  reduced protein synthesis rate by 15%, as measured by -aa pulse-labeling of proteins . the higher loss of polysomes  suggested a stronger negative impact on the rate of protein synthesis; however, polysomes content and protein synthesis rate may not be directly correlated due to differences in the methodologies used to quantify both variables. in any case, the lower decrease in protein synthesis rate is consistent with the smaller impact of mistranslation on growth rate .

the above observations and the possible increase in mrna capping activity due to up-regulation of the dcs <dig> gene  led us to analyse the yeast translatome, that is, the fraction of mrnas that were effectively translated in mistranslating cells. for this, mrnas were extracted from polysomes and were hybridized onto dna microarrays as above. a direct comparison of the log <dig> expression ratios  between the polysomal and total mrna fractions at mistranslations time t90' showed homo-directional expression variation  between transcription and translation for most genes . analysis of the genes that had fold variation >  <dig>  or < - <dig>  allowed us to identify  <dig> genes with similar variation at both transcriptome and translatome levels:  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in both analyses, overlap with likelihood p <  <dig>   . a cross stress analysis of the degs of the mistranslation translatome , environmental stress translatome  and go terms enrichment analysis further supported the down-regulation of protein synthesis processes and the up-regulation of the stress response . more interestingly, it clustered mistranslations at t90' with stronger stressors, namely sorbitol  and amino acid starvation, further confirming that yeast cells integrated the gene mistranslation effects as a strong rather than as a weak stressor  <cit>  .

the up-regulated genes are mainly involved in the general and oxidative stress responses  and unfolded protein binding , confirming that some of the transcriptionally up-regulated genes were being translated . a similar result was obtained for genes with negative fold variation which were involved in ribosome assembly and translation . the list of down-regulated genes included ribosomal protein genes and structural acidic proteins of the ribosome, namely protein p <dig> alpha , protein p <dig> alpha  and protein p <dig> , which form a pentameric complex 2) on the ribosomal 60s subunit  which stimulates translation factor-dependent gtp hydrolysis  <cit> . the snu <dig> gene, which encodes a rna binding protein involved in rrna processing by the u <dig> snornp and in mrna splicing through the u4/u6-u <dig> tri-snornp  <cit> , was also down-regulated . interestingly, the rps18b and rps18a genes, which encode structural proteins of the cytosolic  and mitochondrial  ribosome small subunits  <cit> , appeared in this restricted list of deregulated genes, suggesting that gene mistranslations had a negative impact on both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial translation.

direct positive ++, direct negative -- and inverse +-; go enrichment for each group was done using the r package gostats; the p-values for the processes described in the text are indicated.

a third category of genes  had negative transcriptional and positive translational values , indicating that they were regulated at the translational level. most of these genes encode proteins involved in toxin and chemical stimulus responses  and drug transport, for example, flr <dig>  atr <dig>  pma <dig> and aqr <dig> . a significant number of genes encoding components of yeast transposons, namely ybl005w-a, yfl002w-b, yor343w-a, ybl101w-a and yor343w, appeared in this group , suggesting that gene mistranslations generate genome diversity through mobilization of transposon activity.

unidirectional changes between transcription and translation are associated with a gene expression phenomenon called potentiation  <cit> , which is characteristic of specific groups of genes under strong stress intensity  <cit> . mistranslations potentiated the expression of the plasma membrane chaperone gene hsp <dig> , which represses the h-atpase pma <dig>  the cell wall protein gene pst <dig> , which is activated in response to cell wall damage, the oxidative stress genes grx <dig>  ctt <dig>  trx <dig>  ecm <dig>  ahp <dig>  ald <dig> , the phospholipid binding protein gene sip <dig> , the cell wall secretory glycoprotein gene ygp <dig> , and the multi-stress protein genes ddr <dig> and oye <dig> . interestingly, genes that were negatively represented in the total mrna profile but had positive representation in the translatome profile   were also involved in the stress response. for example, the plasma membrane multidrug transporter gene flr <dig> , the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase gene gpx <dig> , the bzip transcription regulator of the upr  , the putative aryl alcohol dehydrogenase genes aad <dig> and aad <dig> , the sulfiredoxin gene srx <dig>  whose protein reduces cysteine-sulfinic acid groups in the peroxiredoxins tsa <dig> and ahp <dig> and contributes to oxidative stress resistance which was further enhanced by overexpression of the glutathione s-transferase gene gtt <dig> .

gene mistranslations activate the unfolded protein response
the transcriptome and translatome profiling data strongly suggested that gene mistranslations activated the upr through the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the er  <cit> . indeed, several genes encoding er resident proteins involved in protein folding and protection from oxidative stress were up-regulated . for example, the kar <dig> gene, which encodes an atpase with chaperone activity involved in protein import and export into and from the er and regulates the upr by interacting with ire1p  <cit> , was up-regulated  <dig> -fold at time t90',  <dig> -fold at t120' and  <dig> -fold at t180' . the scj <dig> gene whose protein cooperates with kar <dig> in protein maturation in the er, pdi <dig> and eug <dig> genes which encode proteins involved in disulfide bond formation and unscrambling of non-native disulfide bonds, were all slightly up-regulated by the mistranslations . other genes encoding non-er resident proteins that are up-regulated by the upr were also up-regulated. these genes are involved in cell wall remodelling, lipid biosynthesis and in the response to oxidative stress. go terms enrichment analysis showed that the upr response to mistranslations is similar to that induced by mms and affects mainly protein folding, translocation, erad and er oxidative stress .

expression of the transcription factor hac1p, which regulates upr genes through the upr enhancer   <cit> , was slightly up-regulated at the translatome level at t90' and was down-regulated  <dig> -fold at the same time point in the total mrna profile . this post-transcriptional regulation of hac <dig> expression was consistent with processing and activation of the hac <dig> mrna since its pre-mrna contains a  <dig> bp intron whose retention in the hac <dig> pre-mrna renders its mrna untranslatable . splicing of this intron allows for translation of the hac <dig> mrna  and subsequent activation of the upr via transcription of er genes  <cit> . the spliced  and unspliced  forms of hac <dig> mrna were detected at t0' by rt-pcr and increased haci levels were observed between t90' and t180' , confirming that the upr was activated, explaining the increased transcription of upr genes containing upres from t90' to t180' . this delay in the activation of the upr  contrasted with the early detection of mistranslations   and with the early up-regulation of stress-induced chaperones . therefore, steady state activity of proteome quality control systems, in particular of stress-induced molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, likely mitigated the early proteome disruption caused by mistranslations, but above a certain threshold those quality control systems probably became overloaded and proteome quality maintenance required the upr.

discussion
regulation of the stress response triggered by mistranslation
the similarities between the transcriptional and translational responses elicited by environmental stressors and the gene mistranslations allow one to get the first insight into the gene regulatory networks involved in the cellular response to genome translational infidelities. enrichment of transcription factor  binding motifs present in the degs promoters  identified the general stress response element , the heat-shock responsive element , the proteasome associated control element  and the pleiotropic drug resistance element , as the main cis regulatory elements of the transcriptional responses to gene mistranslations .

the enrichment in stres  indicates that the transcriptional response to gene mistranslations is partly regulated by the cyclic amp  protein kinase a   and the torc <dig> pathways, which control the transcription factors msn2p and msn4p  <cit> . since atp and camp regulate pka signalling through the ras activators  of the adenylate cyclase cyr <dig>  <cit> , gene mistranslations likely decrease camp production because hsp <dig> ssa <dig> regulates positively the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ras . indeed, mistranslated proteins are folding substrates of hsp <dig> chaperones and can deviate ssa <dig> from its interaction with cdc25p  <cit> , lowering its activity and decreasing ras1/ <dig> - cyr <dig> activity, camp production and pka activity  <cit> . the enrichment in stre elements also provides strong evidence for a role of the torc <dig> signalling pathway as it regulates msn2p/4p by promoting their phosphorylation   <cit> . on the other hand, the enrichment in hse  indicates that the observed up-regulation of molecular chaperones is mediated through the heat-shock factor   <cit> . regulation of hsf1p involves phosphorylation, conformational alterations and chromatin structure remodelling and it is difficult to understand how gene mistranslations activate it on the sole basis of the comparative transcriptomic studies that we have carried out. nevertheless, the known down-regulation of hsf1p via direct interaction with ssa1- <dig> members of the hsp <dig> family  <cit>  is of particular relevance here as mistranslated proteins likely reduce the pool of free hsp <dig> allowing for release and activation of hsf1p and transcriptional up-regulation of hse-containing genes.

the enrichment in pace-containing genes  indicates that gene mistranslations up-regulate the ups through the rpn4p transcription factor, which is one of the main regulators of proteasome biosynthesis  <cit> . interestingly, the promoter of the rpn <dig> gene contains hse , yre  and pdre  elements and it is likely that mistranslated proteins activate transcription of pace genes through synergistic interactions between hsf1p, yap1p and pdr1/3p transcription factors. this is consistent with delayed ups activation under gene mistranslations  and suggests that while hsf1p, yap1p and pdr1/3p are directly activated by mistranslated proteins, the ups is activated by a second wave of transcriptional regulation. an alternative hypothesis is that rpn4p is stabilized by mistranslated proteins. rpn4p has a very short half-life under non-stress conditions  but is stable under stress  <cit> ; therefore, ups overloading with mistranslated proteins may stabilize it, providing additional signals for up-regulation of genes encoding proteasome subunits and other pace genes.

regarding the up-regulation of stress genes regulated by pdres , there is again an interesting connection with hsp <dig> family members as pdr3p is negatively regulated by hsp70-ssa <dig>  while pdr1p is positively regulated by the clip hsp <dig> ssz <dig>  <cit> . hence, mistranslated proteins likely activate pdr3p by freeing it from the repressive interaction with hsp70-ssa1/ <dig>  suggesting that activation of multidrug response genes is mediated through pdr3p rather than pdr1p as the latter is likely down-regulated under mistranslations due to decreased expression of the ribosome-associated activator ssz1p . mistranslated proteins translocated into mitochondria should also compete for ssa1/ssa <dig> and may activate the retrograde mechanism, which is known to increase multidrug resistance  <cit> . this is consistent with increased ros production and deregulation of mitochondrial genes, including the mitochondrial chaperones hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> by the gene mistranslations.

the down-regulation of clips, rp and ribi regulons
co-down-regulation of clips and the translational machinery is expected to exacerbate the consequences of the gene mistranslations due to the critical role of these chaperones in folding newly synthesized proteins. indeed, deletion of ssb1/ <dig> results in accumulation of misfolded polyubiquitinated proteins and activation of stress hse regulated genes  <cit> , as is also the case in strains harboring deletions in gimc/gim or tric/cct  <cit> . the down-regulation of these clips may also explain the high expression of hsps as the latter are essential for survival in Δssb1/ <dig> or Δgimc deleted cells and mildly beneficial in cells lacking the rac complex  <cit> . interestingly, accumulation of misfolded proteins is not a major problem in strains lacking gim <dig>  zuo <dig>  ssz <dig> and cct. ssb1/2p are the main players in folding newly synthesized proteins while the other clips play alternative roles. hence, down-regulation of ssb1/ <dig> in the mistranslating cells likely increases accumulation of misfolded proteins, which may explain why cells integrated mistranslations as a strong stressor.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides new insight on how genome wide gene mistranslations induce stress resistance and creates phenotypic variability. activation of the stress response induces a stress cross-protection condition that allows for tolerance to lethal doses of a wide range of environmental stressors  <cit> . stress tolerance in mistranslating cells is, therefore, a secondary effect of esr activation . the impact of mistranslated proteins on molecular chaperones and on their interaction networks explains the phenotypic diversity generated through gene mistranslations. indeed, mistranslated proteins are folding substrates of hsps and clips and their continuous synthesis and accumulation in the cell likely creates chaperones functional insufficiencies that remodel their interaction networks by deviating client substrates . hsp <dig> illustrates nicely the phenotypic consequences of chaperone overloading. this chaperone is highly interconnected , assists folding of approximately  <dig>  client yeast proteins , in particular of proteins involved in signal transduction and protein trafficking. in mammalian cells, it is also involved in receptor maturation and in innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . disruption of hsp <dig> interconnectivity through gene deletions, chemical inhibition or functional overloading, resulted in extensive phenotypic variation  in yeast, fungi, drosophila melanogaster and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the high interconnectivity of most of the  <dig> or so yeast chaperones  suggests, therefore, that mistranslated proteins have high potential to remodel interactions and functions of most chaperones, highlighting avenues to understand the phenotypes associated to gene translational infidelities using systems biology approaches.
