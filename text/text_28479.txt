BACKGROUND
as central core facility labs at the max-planck institute of biochemistry and the embl we provide in-house services for recombinant protein production. the proteins we are asked to produce are from various sources and protein families and are used for crystallization, immunization, biochemical, biophysical or biological studies. we perfom in-depth protein analysis to ensure that delivered proteins are properly folded. however, in many cases, this is a fairly challenging task to achieve, despite the many options that can improve proper protein folding such as construct design, solubility enhancing fusion tags, expression conditions, expression hosts and improved protein purification protocols. the constant challenge is to identify a successful combination of parameters with a minimum of resources. apart from unbiased htp approaches  <cit>  or targeted selection  <cit> , it still remains a time consuming trial and error process in most non-automated protein labs. we had initially focused our screening efforts on constructs and solubility tags in e. coli as a first choice. eukaryotic hosts were used if suggested by the literature or previous experience, or in case e. coli screening had failed. as this happened frequently we decided to implement parallel testing of constructs, solubility tags and expression hosts altogether. in order to handle all these different expression constructs, an efficient parallel cloning method was required. in the past few years, a number of powerful combinatorial cloning methods have been introduced. gateway technology  opened the area of combinatorial cloning more than a decade ago. more recent additions to the list are type ii restriction enzymes , golden gate shuffling  <cit> , rf cloning  <cit>  and sequence and ligation independent cloning slic  <cit> . for recombinant protein expression, several commercial  and non-commercial  <cit>  parallel vector series are available. however, we had already established different expression systems with their respective vectors: the e.coli petm vector series have different tags followed by a protease cleavage site and are based on the same pet backbone  <cit> . differences in expression levels are exclusively based on different tags, not on backbones differences such as copy number, spacer sequences or others. expression uses the powerful t <dig> promoter system at low vector copy number and plasmids confer kanamycin resistence instead of ampicillin, which is crucial for plasmid stability  <cit> , particularly in high cell density fermentations. transient transfection of mammalian cells is another efficient and fast method for protein production. the hek <dig>  cell line is widely used due to high transfection efficiency and suspension growth in serum-free media. a variety of hek <dig> cells are currently available with significant differences in productivity  <cit> . the epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen  <dig>  in hek293e cell line interacts with orip on ptt vectors which increases plasmid persistence and protein expression levels  <cit> . therefore we preferred to customize petm, pfastbac and ptt vectors for parallel cloning rather than adapt to a new system. the method must be sequence and restriction-site independent to allow for incorporation of any dna fragment into any of the vectors. it must be directional and precise and most important, it must be fast, simple, efficient and cost-effective. slic cloning enables sequence independent, precise cloning with minimal or no changes in the amino acid sequence of the target protein and is based on homologous recombination of vector and insert with 15– <dig> bp homologies on both dna ends. the reaction is enhanced using either t <dig> dna polymerase, reca protein or incomplete pcr products  <cit> . in order to adapt vectors for slic, they need to share a common stretch of nucleotides at both ends of the linearized plasmid. we have chosen the hrv 3c protease  <cit>  cleavage site and the 3’ end of the toxic ccdb gene to serve as primer binding sites common to all of the new vectors . the hrv 3c recognition site is located downstream of the n-terminal purification or solubility enhancing tag and can be used for tag removal. the ccdb protein inhibits bacterial growth by selective inhibition of e. coli dna gyrase and can be neutralized by the antitoxin ccda. the ccdb technology was developed by delphi genetics  <cit>  and is licenced for use in gateway vectors as well . in the slic strategy presented here, ccdb introduced into the vector series was designed for strong constitutive expression in order to suppress growth in non-resistant cells at 100% efficiency. the vector is used as a pcr template for the amplification of the linear vector fragment, where ccdb is deleted. the ccdb gene on the template thus prevents the carry-over of the original vector during purification and slic reaction by preventing growth of colonies not containing the gene of interest. we developed pet, pfastbac and ptt parallel cloning vectors, named pcoofy1-x and present protein expression data in each of the respective host organisms.

RESULTS
vector design and cloning strategy
in order to drive strong constitutive ccdb expression from pcoofy vectors, we used the promoter of the major outer membrane lipoprotein ompa, which is one of the strongest promoters in e. coli <cit> . we inserted the respective llp <dig> promoter variant and a shine-dalgarno sequence upstream of the ccdb coding sequence  to ensure translation. ppcrscript-lpp5-ccdb  and all pcoofy ccdb derivatives show 100% killing efficiency when transformed into non-resistant cells. occasionally, we observed the occurrence of ccdb inactivation during plasmid propagation in ccdb survival™ cells  under high selective pressure such as plasmids with high copy number. therefore killing activity has to be verified for every single batch of vector dna. however, since we use the vectors only as templates for pcr linearization the amount of dna used for a single pcr is very low and usually sufficient for multiple slic reactions. typically,  <dig> ng plasmid dna is needed for a single slic reaction. we first cloned llp5-ccdb into petm <dig>  petm <dig>  petm <dig> and petm <dig> to generate pcoofy <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the parallel slic cloning procedure was established using egfp as gene of interest according to the strategy illustrated in figure 1a. pcoofy vectors were pcr linearized with 3c - lp <dig> forward and ccdb - lp <dig> reverse primer . the lp <dig> primer corresponds to the hrv 3c protease site , the lp <dig> primer is located at the c-terminus of ccdb in order to delete the gene upon pcr amplification. egfp was pcr amplified with primers composed of gene specific sequences plus  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp extensions complementary to lp <dig> and lp <dig> vector primers, respectively .

when the slic reaction was carried out with insert and vector at a molar ratio of 1: <dig> without any treatment prior to transformation into chemocompetent omnimax™  <dig> t1r cells, cloning efficiency was below 70%. addition of reca raised overall cloning efficiency to > 95%. t <dig> dna polymerase treatment of vector and insert  <cit>  was equally efficient, but due to simplicity we continued with the reca protocol. we tested several other variations to the basic protocol, however none of these further improved cloning efficiency: number of pcr cycles, pcr without extension step, extended lp <dig> and lp <dig> primer length for vector and insert pcr amplification, amount of vector and insert, molar ratio of vector and insert,  <dig> min 95°c denaturation of vector and insert mix followed by slow renaturation at 22° . e.coli cells used for transformation may have an impact on quantity and quality of recombination events and should be tested first. at the max-planck institute we use chemocompetent omnimax™  <dig> t1r cells with a typical transformation efficiency of 107/μg puc plasmid dna.

vector list and cloning statistics
the list of e.coli pcoofy vectors was extended by modifying additional petm vectors or by introducing his <dig>  onestrep, s or halo tags from templates listed in table  <dig>  all n- terminal tags are followed by the hrv 3c recognition site leu-phe-gln/gly-pro. specific cleavage occurs between gln and gly, with gly-pro remaining at the n terminus of the target protein. in order to express proteins that have to retain their native n-terminus after tag removal we generated ccdb versions of pet28m-sumo <dig> and pet28m-sumo <dig> vectors. the sumo  tag is recognized and removed by sumo protease in a structure specific manner to yield the target protein with its native n terminus  <cit> . cloning a target gene into pcoofy <dig> and pcoofy <dig> requires the corresponding sumo-lp <dig> primer for vector and insert pcr amplification . we also generated e.coli vectors with either a c-terminal his <dig> or onestrep tag , which require the corresponding lp <dig> vector and insert primer for slic cloning . moreover, constructs without any n-terminal tag can be generated using lp <dig> tagless primers for the appropriate backbone. n-tagless primer were validated and used for pet and pfastbac backbones so far . in order to further increase c-tag variations but at the same time reduce the number of vectors to be generated we designed a 2nd generation ccdb cassette . llp5-ccdb is followed by a row of c-terminal tags all separated by a stop codon. depending on the lp <dig> primer used for vector and insert pcr linearization, either no tag, the his <dig>  s, onestrep, cbp, hpc <dig> or Æ54cpd <dig> self cleaving tag is fused to the c-terminus of the protein. except for the Æ54cpd <dig> self cleaving tag, c-terminal tags lack a protease cleavage site and cannot be removed. at this time we have cloned this ccdb - c- tag cassette into ptt <dig>  and validated egfp and target gene expression in mammalian cells. pcoofy derivatives of pfastbac <dig> are currently available with his <dig>  his6gst and his6mbp n-terminal tags .

we have effectively cloned more than  <dig> inserts into all different vectors of the pcoofy series. for all constructs, the dna sequence of the translated gene fusion was controlled. we did not sequence the vector backbone of recombinant constructs, as we have never observed any compromised vector function. insert sizes ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, with a majority in the range of 500– <dig> bp. the number of clones per slic reaction varied with an average of about  <dig> throughout the entire distribution of insert sizes. as we never observed any background, we were not concerned if clone numbers were low, as the clone was correct in almost all cases .

expression in e.coli
prior to use for requested target proteins, every new vector was validated with egfp for cloning and small scale expression in the respective host. in case the expression level was unexpectedly low, we removed the vector from the list. for example a his10trx-egfp construct was expressed at about 20% of total protein in e.coli total cell lysate. when the double tag was switched to trxhis10-egfp the expression level increased to more than 70% . figure 5a shows a comparison of expression level and solubility of egfp fused to several purification and solubility enhancing tags in e.coli. trx, mbp and nusa protein fusions show the highest solubility as reported previously  <cit>  and also the highest expression level at up to 80% of total cellular protein. most interesting, his6gst-egfp expressed at a high level but at low solubility. this result corroborates our previous observation, that his6gst expressed from the original petm <dig> vector was insoluble . most of the e.coli expression data for requested target proteins at our protein production service were collected for the first pcoofy vectors 1– <dig> corresponding to n-terminal his <dig>  his6trx, his6gst and his6mbp tags. in agreement with the egfp expression data, mbp had a major impact on protein solubility . this is also exemplified by e.coli expression of two pil protein mutants in pcoofy <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> : expression levels range between 50% - and 80%, of target protein in e.coli total cell lysate with lower or no expression of the his6gst fusion protein. in the course of the project, only the his6mbp-pil fusion proteins were soluble also after tag removal with hrv 3c protease .

expression in insect cells
pcoofy vectors allow for parallel screening in e.coli and insect and/or mammalian cells which has increased protein production throughput in our facilities substantially. here we show two examples, vasp and odc, where parallel cloning allowed us to switch from the e.coli expression host to the baculovirus expression system easily without much delay. in the case of topoisomerase  <dig>  baculovirus expression of two parallel constructs improved project progress.

expression of gst-vasp in e.coli was described previously  <cit> . when we expressed gst-vasp in e.coli we observed partial proteolytical degradation and also coaggregation of degradation products with full-length protein. instead of investing time in optimizing bacterial expression, we cloned vasp into pfastbac derivatives pcoofy <dig>  and pcoofy <dig>  and expressed both constructs in sf <dig> cells without any signs of degradation . purified full-length his6gst-vasp was shown to be biologically active . ornithin decarboxylase  was properly folded when expressed in e.coli , but for co-expression purposes it had to be purified from insect cells. we therefore cloned the odc gene into pcoofy <dig>  and expressed the odc protein in high five cells . again, slic cloning enabled rapid change of expression host. expression of gst-top <dig> in insect cells was described previously  <cit> . we cloned top <dig> in pcoofy <dig>  and pcoofy <dig>  in parallel and tested expression in high five cells. his6mbp-top <dig> showed much higher expression level than his6gst-top <dig> and was purified to homogeneity in enzymatically active form.  .

expression in hek293e cells
protein purification from hek293e cells in our hands is not very efficient using standard immobilized metal affinity purification. we therfore have introduced alternative c-terminal purification tags into ptt <dig> . the ccdb - c - tag cassette into ptt <dig> increases plasmid size by  <dig> bp. in order to analyze if this has an impact on transient gene expression in hek293e cells, we compared expression levels of both intracellular egfp and secreted cd <dig> ligand protein  <cit> . both proteins were expressed from the original ptt vectors  <cit>  and their respective pcoofy derivatives. transient transfection of both genes show comparable levels of egfp in the total cell lysate and cd <dig> ligand in the culture supernatant when either expressed from ptt or pcoofy .

in order to test these alternative purification tags we fused them to egfp, transiently expressed in hek293e cells and purified with the respective affinity resin, except Æ54cpd <dig>  which is specifically activated by inositol hexakisphosphate  present in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . comparison of c-terminal s-tag, his <dig>  hpc, cbp and onestrep showed best expression levels for both s and his <dig> tag. protein yield was lowest for s-tag, hpc and cbp. best yield and purity were obtained for egfp-one strep and egfp-his <dig> when washed stringently with 50mm and 80mm imidazole . in summary, we have shown effective protein expression and purification from pcoofy <dig> vectors that can now be included in our parallel cloning strategy.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a method that allow one to tailor any given expression vector for efficient, fast, robust and cost-effective parallel cloning. high cloning efficiency is guaranteed via strong constitutive ccdb expression that, in contrast to dpni digestion, is 100% efficient in counterselection of parental insert-less vector. the procedure is very robust and has been easily implemented in research groups in-house or externally. we have generated more than  <dig> parallel vectors for expression in bacteria, insect and hek <dig> cells with different purification and solubility enhancing tags that we consider to be helpful in our workflow. this list of pcoofys has fundamentally increased our throughput and success rate in protein purification. we are constantly expanding the list of vectors and have also integrated the ccdb-c-tag cassette into baculovirus, pichia pastoris and hansenula polymorpha vectors which still need to be validated.

with the strategy presented here it is straightforward to assemble any tag combination of interest for any selected application. moreover, with the use of slic, as many as five inserts can be assembled in one reaction simultaneously with great efficiency  <cit> . thus a modular combination of any vector element such as purification tag, signal sequences, antibiotic resistance etc. would be possible. the llp-ccdb counterselection gene presented in this work could also enhance cloning efficiency of other cloning methods as rf or others.
