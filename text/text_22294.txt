BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  is an important cause of infantile diarrhea, particularly in developing countries  <cit> . epec causes protracted and chronic diarrhea, and the severity of this disease may require extensive hospitalization  <cit> . the majority of epec isolates belong to classic serotypes derived from  <dig> classical o serogroups   <cit> . a key characteristic of epec strains is the ability to intimately attach to intestinal epithelial cells and form attaching and effacing  lesions. these lesions are characterized by the destruction of the microvilli and the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, culminating in a pedestal-like structure at the site of bacterial contact  <cit> . the ae genes are localized to the locus for enterocyte effacement  and encode intimin, a type iii secretion system, secreted proteins  and the translocated intimin receptor  <cit> . another epec characteristic is the formation of microcolonies on cell monolayers “in vitro”, a pattern known as localized adherence   <cit> . epec forms microcolonies on cultured epithelial cells, cultures of pediatric small intestinal tissue, and biopsy samples from epec patients  <cit> .

“typical” epec  also contains the epec adherence factor  plasmid  <cit> , which carries genes encoding a regulator   <cit>  and the bundle-forming pili   <cit>  that mediates la to epithelial cells. epec strains, lacking the eaf plasmid are deprived of bfp, and have been designated “atypical” epec   <cit> . aepec strains can still adhere to hep- <dig> cells in a localized adherence-like pattern , forming loose bacterial microcolonies  <cit> . recent epidemiological studies indicate that aepec is more prevalent than tepec in both developed and developing countries  <cit> .

the aepec strains are genetically related to the enterohemorrhagic e. coli , and both are considered emerging pathogens  <cit> . some previous studies showed that certain ehec strains have the abilities to attach, colonize, and form biofilm on various surfaces  <cit> . some adhesins such as type  <dig> pilus , flagella, hcp , curli, antigen  <dig> , calcium-binding antigen  <dig> homologue , and autotransporter protein of ehec  have been implicated in the formation of microcolonies and biofilms  <cit> . even though epec form microcolonies and causes persistent infections, very little is known regarding biofilm formation by epec strains, and their survival outside the host.

recently, moreira et al.  <cit>  published the first description of biofilm formation by the prototype tepec e2348/ <dig>  strain. these researchers found that adhesive structures, such as type  <dig> fimbriae, ag <dig>  bfp, and espa, were expressed during the initial stages of biofilm development. more recently, weiss-muszkat et al.  <cit>  reported a multicellular behavior characterized by the formation of a robust biofilm on an abiotic surface at 26°c, but not at 37°c, a dense pellicle at the air-liquid interface and a red, dry, and rough  morphotype in one o55:h <dig> aepec strain. transposon mutagenesis analysis identified curli fibers and the crl regulator as important participants in the formation of all three types of biofilms. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of biofilm formation in a collection of  <dig> aepec strains isolated from diarrheic and nondiarrhiec children. the presence of adhesins related to biofilm formation and the association of biofilm formation and these adhesins were also investigated.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> epec strains isolated from  <dig> children with diarrhea and  <dig> asymptomatic controls were examined for the capacity of biofilm formation. as shown in table  <dig>  biofilm formation occurred in  <dig>  of strains of different serotypes after 24 h of incubation at 26°c and 37°c. the frequency of biofilm producers was higher among isolates from patients compared to isolates from controls . most of the biofilm-producing strains formed biofilms on an abiotic surface at 26°c , but not at 37°c . among these, four strains  formed a stronger biofilm than did the others.

a
abiofilm assays were performed in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates in luria broth and incubated for 24 h at 26°c and 37°c.

as shown in table  <dig>  the fima/fimh genes were identified in  <dig>  strains, and the expression of type  <dig> fimbriae, was identified in all of them by msha assays. the genes related to curli  were identified in  <dig>  strains, and all of them expressed curli as judged by characteristic red-colonies formed on cr agar plates. in addition,  <dig> of strains formed a thick pellicle at the air-liquid interface at 26°c and 37°c. the flagella gene  was identified in  <dig>  strains. the genes related to the autotransporter proteins ag <dig> , cah , and ehaa  occurred in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  strains, respectively. the gene hcpa was identified in two strains.

in attempt to identify genes potentially involved in biofilm formation, we selected one strong biofilm producer, but curli-negative, strain a <dig> of serotype o119:hnd for mutagenesis. like a previously described aepec o55:h <dig> strain, the a <dig> strain formed a strong biofim on an abiotic surface at 26°c, but not at 37°c, and a dense pellicle at the air-liquid interface . we generated a transposon library in the a <dig> strain using the ez::tn < r6kyori/kan-2 > tnp transposome which confers resistance to kanamycin and screened the mutants for their capacity to produce biofilm. among the  <dig> -transposon mutants screened, eight biofilm deficient mutants were identified and compared to the wild type strain. all of them were deficient in their biofilm formation ability and did not form a pellicle at the air-liquid interface . identification of the transposon insertion sites was performed using pcr and sequence analysis. the dna sequences of the mutants revealed similarity with type  <dig> fimbriae , diguanylate cyclase , atp synthase f <dig>  beta subunit , and the uncharacterized yjic protein . in two mutants the insertion site was too short for analysis.

this study showed that the ability to adhere to abiotic surfaces and form biofilm at low temperature is present in an array of aepec strains, and not restricted to a particular set of serotypes. in addition, our case control analysis showed an association between the biofilm-formation ability and diarrhea. these findings suggest that biofilm formation may play a role in the pathogenesis of some aepec strains.

a varied distribution of genes related to fimbrial and afimbrial adhesins reported in the literature to be associated with biofilm formation was identified among aepec strains. recently, it has been shown that aepec strains harbor several pilus operons that could favor host colonization and environment survival  <cit> . in agreement with these findings, in our study, several adhesin genes were detected in most of the biofilm-producing strains. interestingly, we observed an association between fima/fimh genes and biofilm formation. of the  <dig> biofilm producers,  <dig>  carried the fima/fimh genes versus  <dig>  of  <dig> non-biofilm producers . in addition, the curli genes, csga and crl were found in  <dig>  biofilm producers vs  <dig>  non-biofilm producers . no association was found between flic, flu, cah, ehaa, or hcpa genes.

a recent study reported that the ability of an epec strain of serotype o55:h <dig> to produce biofilm at low temperature  was associated with curli  <cit> . in contrast, the a <dig> strain belonging to o119:hnd formed a strong biofilm at 26°c pellicle at the air-liquid interface, but did not produce a red color on agar plates containing congo red, implying that it does not produce curli. three out of the six tn <dig> mutants analyzed had insertions in genes associated with type  <dig> fimbriae. it seems that, in this particular strain, type  <dig> fimbriae plays an important role in the interaction with abiotic surfaces, as the inactivation of the fimc, fimd, and fimh genes, significantly reduced its capacity to form biofilm and pellicle. in agreement with our findings, it has been recently reported that a mutation in the fima gene of an aepec strain drastically affected its ability to form biofilm on plastic surface  <cit> .

in addition, in one mutant, the inactivation of diguanylate cyclase also impaired biofilm formation. cellular levels of c-di-gmp, a ubiquitous second messenger in bacteria, are controlled through the opposing activities of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases. cyclic-di-gmp antagonistically controls motility and virulence of single, planktonic cells on one hand, and cell adhesion and persistence of multicellular communities on the other  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study showing that the ability to adhere to abiotic surfaces and form biofilm is present in an array of aepec strains, and is not restricted to a particular set of serotypes. our data suggest that type  <dig> fimbriae and diguanylate cyclase may be involved in aepec biofilm formation. characterization of additional biofilm deficient mutants may reveal other mechanisms involved in biofilm formation and bring new insights into aepec pathogenesis.
