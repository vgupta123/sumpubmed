BACKGROUND
spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats , a substrain of spontaneously hypertensive rats  derived from wistar kyoto rats, develop malignant hypertension at an early age and have an increased incidence of spontaneous hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes  <cit> . in this model, cerebral hemorrhage or infarction occurs in 82% of males over 100 days of age and 58% of females over 150 days of age  <cit> . therefore, shrsp has been used as a suitable experimental model for the investigation of hypertension-related cerebrovascular diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage and infarction  <cit> . there is increasing evidence suggesting that blood–brain barrier  disruption is the key factor for the onset of stroke in shrsp  <cit> , and several studies have shown that bbb disruption preceded strokes in shrsp  <cit> . increased vascular permeability preceded intracerebral hemorrhage in shrsp using magnetic resonance imaging  <cit> . furthermore, stroke originated from bbb disruption in shrsp based on microscopy studies  <cit> . bbb disruption has been shown to start from 12– <dig> weeks of age in shrsp  <cit> . bbb disruption occurs in several regions including the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum in shrsp, and the extent of bbb disruption increases age-dependently. in contrast, the most localized bbb disruption was clearly seen in the hippocampus in shrsp aged 3 months  <cit> . furthermore, bbb disruption in shrsp is considered to be the result of enhanced oxidative stress  <cit> .

matrix metalloproteinases , members of the family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, are fundamental in extracellular matrix physiology  <cit> . two specific mmps, mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig> , have been the subjects of extensive studies in the stroke field. activated mmps have been reported in shr and shrsp  <cit> . mmps, in particular mmp- <dig>  are another important factor in bbb disruption  <cit> . furthermore, several studies showed that mmp activities may be regulated by reactive oxygen species   <cit> .

hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrites are very strong ros that react indiscriminately with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, resulting in dna fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, and protein inactivation  <cit> . since hydrogen gas was reported to reduce infarct size and improve neurological function in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model by selectively scavenging hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrites  <cit> , the effects of hydrogen have been studied extensively on several pathologies in the central nervous system, heart, kidney, liver, and intestines  <cit> . hydrogen has been shown to have potent protective cellular effects by reduction of oxidative stress markers, including 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine  , 4-hydroxynonenal  , and malondialdehyde   <cit> . in particular, intraperitoneal hydrogen-rich saline injection reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function via attenuation of neuronal injury in a rat common carotid artery occlusion and hypoxia model  <cit> , and hydrogen gas improved survival rate via attenuation of neuronal injury, autophagy, and bbb disruption in a mouse bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model  <cit> . furthermore, intrathecal hydrogen-rich saline injection improved neuropathic pain behavior by reducing ros in the spinal astrocytes and microglia in a rat neuropathic model  <cit> .

hydrogen therapy is usually administered by three methods, inhalation of hydrogen gas, injection of hydrogen-rich saline, and ingestion of hydrogen-rich water   <cit> . ingestion of hrw is considered to be safer and more convenient and suitable for long-term treatment  <cit> . hydrogen can downregulate many molecules, including mmp- <dig> and/or mmp- <dig>  <cit> . hydrogen gas decreased oxidative stress  and exerted neuroprotective effects , and also reduced mmp- <dig> activation in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model  <cit> . however, whether long-term hydrogen treatment can improve neurological function under chronic hypertensive conditions is unknown.

the present study investigated  whether long-term  hrw treatment can improve outcome in the shrsp model, and  the effect of hrw on bbb function, focusing on the oxidative stress and the activity of mmps at the early stage in the shrsp model.

methods
animals and experimental procedures
all experimental procedures were approved by the animal care and use committee of the national defense medical college. fifty-six male shrsp at 6 weeks of age were purchased from japan slc . the rats were housed in individual cages under controlled environmental conditions  with ad libitum access to funabashi sp diet, which contains  <dig> % crude protein,  <dig> % crude fat,  <dig> % crude fiber, and  <dig>  mg/g of sodium , and water. animals at 6 weeks were randomly assigned to  <dig> groups and treated as follows:  shrsp treated with hrw ; and  shrsp treated with regular water . body weight was measured every day. blood pressure and heart rate were measured by the tail cuff method in conscious rats, using a non-preheating, non-invasive blood pressure monitor  weekly. twenty animals were observed until 16 weeks after treatment  for survival analysis . surviving animals at 16 weeks after treatment were sacrificed for histological examination with hematoxylin and eosin  staining. in addition,  <dig> animals at 8 weeks after treatment  were sacrificed for histological examination with he and immunohistochemistry , gelatin zymography , or serum 8-ohdg analysis . all assays and measurements in this study were performed by investigators unaware of the experimental groups.

preparation of hrw
hrw was made using hydrogen water  <dig>  , as previously reported  <cit> . briefly, hydrogen gas was produced in an acrylic resin tube and introduced into a polyethylene terephthalate  bottle. the pet bottle was completely filled with water. hydrogen gas was produced from  <dig>  g of 75% by weight of metal aluminum grains and 25% by weight of calcium hydroxide. this material with  <dig>  ml of water was inserted into an acrylic resin tube, and a cap with a check valve was tightly closed. after 5 minutes, the reaction started in the wet fabric. the hydrogen gas produced was passed through the check valve into the water in the pet bottle. after the hydrogen-generating reaction was terminated, the hydrogen gas was dissolved by shaking the bottle. the concentration of hydrogen in water was measured by titration using methylene blue-platinum colloid reagent as previously reported  <cit> , and the measured concentration was 5 ppm.

oral administration of hrw
hrw was prepared each day and 200 ml per rat was delivered twice a day at 20-22°c in glass bottles  with tight rubber caps to rats in the hrw group. regular water was given to rats in the control group. the water temperature was monitored and maintained at 20-22°c.

monitoring of neurological deficits and death
the appearance of neurological deficits was carefully monitored every day. the neurological deficits were evaluated according to a scoring system:  <dig>  normal;  <dig>  slight decrease in motor activity or slight excitement;  <dig>  marked decrease in motor activity or hyperirritability;  <dig>  no walking ;  <dig>  inability to stand without support or paralysis of hind limbs; and  <dig>  death  <cit> . macroscopic autopsy of the brain, lung, heart, aorta, bilateral carotid arteries, liver, kidney, and intestine was performed on dead animals to determine the cause of death.

blood collection
blood samples were collected transcardially under anesthesia induced with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium  by intra-peritoneal injection at 8 weeks after treatment. serum samples were obtained after centrifuging for 15 minutes at  <dig>  rpm, and used for the assay of serum 8-ohdg.

tissue preparation
for histological examination with he and immunohistochemical studies, animals were perfused transcardially with normal saline, followed by 4% buffered paraformaldehyde under anesthesia induced with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium by intra-peritoneal injection at  <dig> or 16 weeks after treatment. the brain was removed and embedded in paraffin after fixation in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, followed by  <dig>  mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline  for 24 hours at 4°c. the 5-μm coronal sections were prepared. for the gelatin zymography study, animals were decapitated under anesthesia induced with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium by intra-peritoneal injection and their brains were removed, quickly cut into several regions including the cortex and the hippocampus.

measurement of serum 8-ohdg
serum samples obtained from blood samples were used for the measurement of 8-ohdg. serum 8-ohdg was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following the manufacturer’s instructions . optical density was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader . quantification of 8-ohdg was achieved by comparing the optical densities of each sample to that of internal standards of various known concentrations of 8-ohdg.

he staining
ten sections per animal  were prepared. one slice per section was stained with he for surviving animals at 16 weeks after treatment  and animals at 8 weeks after treatment . ten slices per animal were observed to count the numbers of bleeds and thromboses/infarcts. sections were examined using a microscope  equipped with a digital camera system .

immunohistochemistry
the sections  from animals sacrificed at 8 weeks after treatment were stained overnight at 4°c with anti-8-ohdg  and anti-albumin . sections were covered with mounting medium containing  <dig> -diamidino-2-phenylindole  for fluorescence microscopy . immunoreactivity was detected using a diaminobenzidine method. for quantitative analysis, the number of 8-ohdg-positive cells and the number of vessels with extravasated albumin signals were counted in the bilateral cortices and hippocampi  <cit> . six slices  per animal were evaluated, and the average count per high power field of view was calculated from the bilateral cortices and hippocampi, respectively.

for double staining, the sections were incubated in a nonspecific blocking reagent  for 30 minutes to reduce background staining. sections were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°c. primary antibodies were anti-8-ohdg , anti-mmp- <dig> and − <dig> , anti-neuronal nuclear antigen   , anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein   , and anti-iba- <dig>   antibodies. for fluorescent staining, sections were incubated with alexa-fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g  for primary antibodies derived from the mouse. for primary antibody derived from the rabbit, alexa-fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin g  was used. sections were examined using a microscope  equipped with a digital camera system .

gelatin zymography
metalloproteinase extraction from brains was performed according to a previously described method  <cit> . briefly, the frozen tissue samples were homogenized with a lysis buffer . the homogenates were centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 15 minutes. the supernatants were recovered and total protein concentrations were measured . each lane was loaded with 20 μg total plasma protein with loading buffer  at a 1: <dig> ratio. gelatin at a concentration of  <dig> % was incorporated into the 10% polyacrylamide gel containing  <dig> % sds. electrophoresis was performed at 25 ma until the bromophenol blue marker dye reached the bottom of the gel. after washing in  <dig> % triton x- <dig> to remove sds, the gels were incubated overnight in a developing buffer  at 37°c. the gels were then stained with  <dig> % coomassie blue and destained. densitometric analysis used the nih imagej software program .

statistical analysis
the data are presented as means ± sem. survival rates were examined using the kaplan-meier method. the survival curves were compared using a log-rank test. comparisons between two groups were performed with an unpaired t-test. a value of p <  <dig>  was considered to be significant. the graphpad prism  <dig>  software program  was used for all statistical tests.

discussion
the present study showed that long-term hrw treatment significantly improved neurological function and reduced the prevalence of cerebral lesions in shrsp, but had no effect on blood pressure. this beneficial effect was associated with  reduction in oxidative dna damage,  decrease in bbb leakage in the hippocampus, and  suppression of mmp- <dig> activity in the hippocampus at 8 weeks after treatment .

in the present study, we used 8-ohdg as biomarker for oxidative stress. we observed that 8-ohdg and bbb disruption were detected mainly in the hippocampus, but rarely in the cortex. bbb disruption may be localized in the hippocampus in early life , and subsequently occurs in other regions including the cortex and the basal ganglia as well as the hippocampus in shrsp  <cit> . we examined 8-ohdg and bbb function at the age of 14 weeks in shrsp, or still in early life. therefore, faint staining of 8-ohdg and weak bbb disruption in the cortex might reflect the low age of the animals. on the other hand, we observed that hrw reduced 8-ohdg and attenuated bbb disruption in the hippocampus, which is consistent with previous reports that bbb disruption in shrsp is the result of enhanced oxidative stress  <cit> . further investigations are required to assess the localization of bbb disruption and ros in the early life of shrsp.

the present study also investigated the effect of hrw on mmp- <dig> and − <dig>  which are other important factors in bbb disruption  <cit> . the localization of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> in shr and shrsp is controversial. activated mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> was detected in the cortex and basal ganglia in 6-month-old shrsp  <cit> . in contrast, mmp- <dig> was detected in the cortex but not mmp- <dig> in non-operated shr weighing 250–350 g  <cit>  and in non-operated shr weighing 280–320 g  <cit> . in this study, mmp- <dig> was detected in both the cortex and hippocampus, whereas mmp- <dig> was located mainly in the hippocampus at the age of 14 weeks in the control group. these discrepancies between studies might be due to differences in the age. the present study showed that hrw reduced the mmp- <dig> activity in the hippocampus. hydrogen is reported to downregulate many molecules, including mmp- <dig> and/or mmp- <dig>  <cit> . ingestion of hrw decreased oxidative stress and suppressed intimal hyperplasia via reduction in mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> activation in a rat vein-grafting model  <cit> . inhalation of hydrogen gas decreased oxidative stress, exerted neuroprotective effects, and reduced hemorrhagic transformation via reduction in mmp- <dig> activation in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model  <cit> . our result is consistent with these previous findings. therefore, we consider that hrw attenuated bbb disruption through reductions in enhanced oxidative stress and mmp- <dig> activity in the hippocampus. further studies are required to investigate whether hrw attenuates mmp- <dig> activity via reduction in ros, or independently affects mmp- <dig> activity and ros.

the present study showed that 8-ohdg and mmp-2/ <dig> were found in the microglia. microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system and are essential in the immune response, but are also an important component of the neurovascular unit  <cit>  and therefore are involved in bbb disruption  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that microglia can produce ros  <cit> , which is related to bbb disruption. mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are produced mainly by the microglia in a rat traumatic brain injury model  <cit> . in addition, the microglia might be related to pathologies in shrsp  <cit> . marked proliferation of microglia was observed in the white matter of 20-week-old shrsp  <cit> . a marked number of microglia was detected in the white and gray matter at the age of  <dig> to 5 months  <cit> . microglia are activated in the white matter at the age of 28 weeks in shrsp  <cit> . hydrogen has effects on microglia  <cit> , which is consistent with our results.

the present study showed that hrw significantly improved neurological function from  <dig> to 16 weeks after treatment and reduced the prevalence of cerebral lesions in both the cortex and the hippocampus at 16 weeks after treatment in shrsp. taken together with the result that hrw attenuated bbb disruption in the hippocampus, these findings support the results of previous studies that bbb disruption occurs in early life and precedes the stroke onset in shrsp  <cit> . in addition, hrw has beneficial effects in the cortex as well as the hippocampus. in the present study, shrsps were given a high salt diet , which is often used in this model, resulting in development of very severe hypertension from a young age and short life span . hrw showed a strong trend toward improvement in overall survival, although not significantly. the cause of death was mainly massive intracerebral hemorrhage in both two groups, suggesting that additional treatment including antihypertensive therapy might be necessary to prevent massive intracerebral hemorrhage and improve overall survival. further studies are necessary on this point.

the present study has important limitations. we failed to assess whether hrw has the above-mentioned effects in the cortex as well as in the hippocampus in the delayed periods because investigation in the post-stroke period leads to  differences in ages  or  differences in intervals from stroke onset to the assessment point between animals. bbb function, ros, and mmps depend on both the age and interval from the stroke onset. further studies are required to investigate the mechanism of effects of hrw on the cortex in the delayed periods in shrsp.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study suggests that ingestion of hrw can improve neurological function outcome in the shrsp model. this beneficial effect may be due to attenuation of bbb disruption via reduction in ros and suppression of mmp- <dig> activity in the hippocampus.
