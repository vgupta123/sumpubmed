BACKGROUND
transcription factors  are proteins that bind to either promoter or enhancer regions of a gene, thereby regulating the transcription activity of the gene  <cit> . about 10 % of genes in the human genome encode tfs and they are essential for many cellular processes  <cit> . a high proportion of tfs either acts as oncogenes or tumor suppressors or regulates the activity of pathways related to tumor progression. the deregulation of these tfs, reshaping the expression of their target genes, leads to tumor formation, progression, and metastasis  <cit> . numerous studies have revealed the functional impact of aberrant activation of individual tfs on tumor progression. for example, mutations of brca <dig> and brca <dig> cause the genetic instability of the cell and thus confer a substantial risk of breast and ovarian cancer  <cit> .

rather than function alone, transcription factors generally cooperate to control gene expression. like aberrant activation of individual tfs, disruption of tf cooperativity also alters the expression of downstream genes and contributes to disease pathogenesis. several studies have reported the alteration of tf cooperativity in cancer . for example, the association between snail and zeb <dig> is lost in human colon carcinomas  <cit> . snail, zeb, and basic helix-loop-helix  factors ally to mediate the dynamic silencing of cdh <dig>  and loss of cdh <dig> function is a hallmark of carcinoma cell invasiveness  <cit> . three transcription factors ttf1/nkx2- <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  and pax <dig> show pronounced synergy in promoting the proliferation of immortalized human lung epithelial cells, and the alteration of their cooperativity contributes to lung cancer development  <cit> . compared with the rapid accumulation of knowledge on individual tfs, however, there is only limited research on tf cooperativity and our understanding of tf cooperativity perturbation in cancer is lagging far behind.

large-scale genomics projects, such as the cancer genome atlas , generating various omics data for thousands of tumors with matched normal samples  <cit> , have provided a great opportunity to explore the common and specific disruption of gene co-expression across multiple cancer types. for example, west et al. has demonstrated that cancer is characterized by an increase in network entropy, i.e., reduced absolute gene correlations, while cell cycle/proliferation genes are preferentially associated with significant reductions in network entropy  <cit> . here we focused on transcription factors, which are upstream regulators of transcriptome change that results in phenotypic change. we analyzed the dysregulated cooperation between tfs across seven cancer types and compared that with the dysregulation between non-tfs and other downstream effectors. we not only identified specific tf pairs highly disrupted in each individual cancer type but also detected common tfs whose cooperativity were significantly disturbed across diverse cancer types. finally, the disrupted cooperation of irf <dig> in lung cancer was validated by two independent lung squamous cell carcinoma  and lung adenocarcinoma  datasets, and its contribution to tumor progression and patient survival was further investigated.

RESULTS
tf cooperativity is less disturbed than non-tf in cancer
we obtained  <dig> human tfs in total by combining three databases, animaltfdb  <cit> , transfac  <cit> , and tfcat  <cit>  . we studied seven cancer types and each cancer type had mrna expression profiles measured for both tumor and matched normal samples .table  <dig> sample size for each cancer type



tf co-expression has been commonly used to predict tf cooperativity . for instance, hammonds et al. used tfs co-expression to suggest their co-association  <cit> . zhou et al. developed a second-order expression similarity to infer tfs’ cooperativity  <cit> . here we used two lists of known cooperative tfs to study the relationship between co-expression and cooperativity. one included interacting tfs with high confidence from hitpredict   <cit>  , and the other contained tf co-associations based on the non-randomly distributed tf binding regions from encode  <cit> . we used spearman correlation coefficient to measure the co-expression, which is more robust to outliers than pearson correlation. compared to random tf pairs, cooperative tfs were more tightly co-expressed in all the studied cancer types  . among  <dig> co-associated tfs in the hepg <dig> cell line, even higher correlations were observed in the corresponding liver cancer  than general tf associations and random tf pairs . these findings demonstrated that tf co-expression can act as an appropriate proxy for cooperativity.

there was no general bias for tfs on the measure of cooperativity compared to other genes. the scatterplot containing the pair-wise correlation coefficient on the y-axis and the average expression of genes  on the x-axis generally followed a horizontal line around zero in all tumor and normal samples , suggesting no intensity-dependent bias on the measure of cooperativity. tfs had comparable concentrations with non-tfs in each individual cancer type and matched normal samples as well . in addition, tfs, non-tfs and tf targets showed similar cooperativity level in all types of matched normal samples .

to measure the alteration of cooperation, we used the absolute correlation change in tumor versus normal . analysis of gene correlation change, i.e., differential co-expression analysis, is a more comprehensive technique to the differential expression analysis  <cit> . correlation change between tfs is not only caused by expression alteration of individual tfs, but also driven by subtle perturbation in tfs expression coordination, which both potentially leads to the dynamic switch of tf partners  <cit> .

although tf and non-tfs showed comparable cooperative level, the absolute correlation change between tfs was significantly smaller than that between non-tfs across all studied cancer types  > <dig> ) . specifically, breast invasive carcinoma  exhibited the largest difference of correlation change in tfs compared to non-tfs, followed by kidney renal clear cell carcinoma , liver hepatocellular carcinoma , and non-small-cell lung carcinoma  . in contrast, two other groups of genes, metabolic genes and tf target genes, did not show the consistent smaller correlation changes like what tfs presented across different cancer types. instead, these two groups of genes either showed larger or same correlation change compared to those of non-tfs . the fact that only the cooperation between tfs is significantly less disturbed than non-tfs in all types of tumor relative to normal tissues could be explained by the functional roles of transcription factors rather than statistical artifacts or other confounding factors. as upstream regulators for determining gene expression, the cooperativity between tfs is considerably constrained and more robust to disease than that of downstream effectors, like tf targets or genes in metabolic pathway  <cit> . restricting our analysis on two lists of known cooperative tfs, however, we didn’t observe the consistent constrained tf cooperativity across diverse cancer types, which was possibly due to the low coverage and bias of existing knowledge  <cit> . there are only  <dig> tfs with predicted associations from encode, which covers only  <dig>  % of known tfs. although there are much more tfs from hitpredict compared to encode, they have similar number of tf interactions, which suggests the number of tf interactions of hitpredict is far less than expected. moreover, protein-protein interaction networks are generally associated with multiple types of biases, e.g., selection preference  and technical limitations  <cit> .fig.  <dig> cooperativity alterations in tumor versus normal. the box plots illustrate the absolute correlation change in tumor relative to normal between tf pairs , non-tf pairs , metabolic genes  and tf target genes  in nsclc, prad, coadread, brca, hnsc, kirc, and lihc



tightly coordinated tfs lost cooperation in cancer
although the cooperativity between tfs is considerably constrained during tumorigenesis, some tf pairs significantly changed their coordination in cancer. we focused on tf pairs tightly coordinated in either normal or tumor samples . we tracked the cooperation changes of these tf pairs and classified them into three categories, “gain”, “loss” and “reverse” . tf pairs with significant coordination changes  that only appeared in the highly coordinated list in tumor but not in normal were defined as “gain”. accordingly, tf pairs with significant coordination changes  that only presented in the highly coordinated normal list were defined as “loss”. tf pairs showing both in the tumor and normal list but opposite direction  were classified as “reverse”. as expected, there were very few tf pairs belonging to the “reverse” category across all studied cancer types. in most types of cancer, “loss” is dominant over “gain”, especially in brca, nsclc and kirc . due to the dominant effect of losing tightly coordinated tf pairs rather than gaining during tumorigenesis, highly coordinated tf pairs in tumor were less disturbed than those in normal. in brca, the highly cooperative tfs in tumor were even less altered than other tfs . consistent with previous studies revealing cancer is globally characterized by reduced absolute gene correlations  <cit> , our results indicate that tightly coordinated tfs losing their normal cooperation play a major role in tumorigenesis. that is, disrupting the normally coordinated tfs affect gene expression of their target genes, leading to tumor initiation and progression.fig.  <dig> the pair-wise tf cooperativity is mainly lost in tumor relative in normal. a the schema of tf cooperation change. tf pairs with significant coordination changes  that only appeared in the highly coordinated list in tumor but not in normal were defined as “gain”. tf pairs with significant coordination changes  that only presented in the highly coordinated normal list were defined as “loss”. tf pairs showing both in the tumor and normal list but opposite direction  were classified as “reverse”. b bar plot depicts percentage of loss, gain and reverse in tf cooperativity alteration



highly dyscooperated tfs across diverse cancer types
we ranked the disrupted tf pairs in each type of cancer, trying to identify the tf pairs whose cooperativity is commonly disturbed across diverse cancer types. we found different cancer types shared very few highly disrupted tf pairs. among the top  <dig> tf pairs with the highest disruption in cooperativity, there were only 5 ~  <dig> tf pairs shared between two cancer types . moreover, there were only  <dig> tf pairs shared by three or more cancer types . the correlation plots of these  <dig> tf pairs and correlation measures in normal and tumor were given in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  consistent with our previous finding, most of tf pairs lose cooperation during tumorigenesis, such as cxxc1-smad <dig> in nsclc and brca. we also observed that few uncorrelated tfs in normal became co-expressed in tumor, e.g., hsf1-znf <dig> in brca and hnsc , indicating abnormal co-expression potentially drive tumorigenesis as well. taf <dig> and hsf <dig> were identified as driver genes of liver carcinoma and closely linked on chromosome 8q <dig>  <cit> . this finding reveals that tumor is quite different from each other on disrupted tf pairs. among the top  <dig> tf pairs with the highest disruption in cooperativity in each cancer type, less than 50 % of tf pairs were due to the differential expression of tf itself except kirc . among the  <dig> common tf pairs, only the disruption of tceb1-zfp <dig> in lihc was caused by the differential expression of zfp <dig> .fig.  <dig> highly disrupted tfs across diverse cancer types. a heat map of highly disrupted tf pairs shared across different cancer types. upper triangle shows the number of common pairs. b a list of highly disrupted tf pairs shared by more than two cancer types. a and b are based on the top  <dig> tf pairs with the highest disruption in cooperativity. c heat map of common highly disrupted tfs across different cancer types. red bars designate that the tf labeled on the left is identified in the cancer type labeled on the top with greatly disturbed cooperativity with other tfs. datasets from gse and tcga are shaded in different colors. tfs marked with “*” function association with tumor progression



we aggregated the disrupted cooperation of tf pairs to each individual tf by calculating the number of significantly changed cooperation for this tf . the tfs with significant number of broken cooperative relationship are called “highly dyscooperated” tfs. as a result, more than  <dig> highly dyscooperated tfs were identified for each cancer type. kirc identified  <dig> highly dyscooperated tfs, and nsclc discovered  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were recognized for lihc, hnsc, coadread, prad, and brca respectively . less than 50 % of these dyscooperated tfs were differentially expressed in the corresponding cancer type . compared with the low overlap of disrupted tf pairs, the dyscooperated tfs were much more common between different types of cancer, which either share the same tfs or tfs belonging to the same family. for example, nsclc shared  <dig>  % of its highly dyscooperated tfs/tf families with other cancer types . notably, there were  <dig> tfs/tf families common in two or more cancer types . these highly disrupted tf families included well-known genes related to tumor progression, such as the hox family, the zbtb family, wt <dig>  and so on . most interestingly, the interferon regulatory factors  family was detected in six out of the seven studied cancers. specifically, irf <dig> was identified as one of the most dyscooperated tfs in nsclc and coadread, irf <dig> was detected in prad, irf <dig> was found in hnsc and kirc, and irf <dig> was discovered in lihc . irf family members share a dna-binding domain  and recognize a consensus motif, 5′-aanngaaa-3′  <cit> . previous studies have revealed the versatile and critical functions performed by the irf family transcription factors, including immune response, cell growth regulation, cell apoptosis, and hematopoietic development . moreover, irf family members contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. for example, irf <dig> interacts with maspin , which is characterized as a tumor suppressor  <cit> . the targets of irf <dig> are involved in anti-apoptotic function  <cit> . reported as a direct target of p <dig>  <cit> , irf <dig> can also regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis in a p53-independent way  <cit> . irf <dig> is an oncogenic gene which plays a positive role in the cell cycle regulation of the human histone h <dig> gene fo <dig>  <cit> . taken together, it can be inferred that the dyscooperated irf family might be a common mechanism in tumor initiation or progression.

functional effect of dyscooperated irf in tumorigenesis
go enrichment analysis was performed for the target genes of irf transcription factors, which were identified by motif searching and further filtered by chromatin accessibility from dnase-seq data in the corresponding cell lines, to investigate their potential functional roles. the target genes are enriched in many cancer related functions such as cell death, response to stress, cell proliferation, and regulation of apoptotic processes. furthermore,  <dig>  genes are annotated as cancer census genes in the cancer gene census of cosmic  <cit> . among them, braf is an important gene associated with various cancers, including colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma of lung  <cit> ; ndrg <dig> acts as a tumor suppressor gene involved in stress responses, cell growth, and differentiation, and its expression may be a prognostic indicator for several types of cancer .

we explored the potential cause and functional effect of dyscooperated irf family transcription factors in the six cancers. we first compared the expression abundance of irf transcription factors in tumor versus normal to see whether the dyscooperation is caused by differential expression of the tf itself. we found that the irf transcription factor was not significantly differentially expressed in each tumor versus the matched normal , which means the dyscooperation of irf members was caused by perturbation in expression coordination rather than expression alteration of the irf itself. moreover, the expression abundances of irf target genes were more significantly disturbed than non-target genes  . to reduce the potential bias introduced by the global effect of tumorigenesis, we further compared the expression alteration of irf’s targets and non-targets involved in the stress response. as a result, the targets involved in stress response were more likely to be dysregulated than non-targets with the same function across all six cancer types . these results demonstrated that disturbance of the irf cooperativity affects the transcription of downstream target genes. the observation that the dysregulation of the target genes is mainly caused by the disrupted tf cooperation rather than differentially expressed tf itself suggests that the analysis of tf cooperativity in tumor is more important than previously recognized. it holds great potential for identifying novel drivers that could never be discovered by regular differential expression analysis.fig.  <dig> expression abundance of irf in tumor versus normal. each point in the plot represents a sample. fdr is given on the top, and the median concentration in tumor/normal is shown by a dashed line

fig.  <dig> comparison of expression alterations between irf’s targets and other genes. the plots illustrate the cumulative distribution function  of expression alteration in tumor versus normal for irf’s targets and non-targets across six cancer types. the x-axis is the absolute value of log <dig> fold change of expression. the significance of difference between target and non-target genes is also shown in the plots



validation of dyscooperated irf <dig> using luad and lusc datasets
we downloaded two public rna-seq datasets from tcga and performed the same analysis on the disrupted tf cooperation. one includes  <dig> luad patient tumor and adjacent normal samples, and the other consists of  <dig> lusc tumor and matched normal samples . consistent with our observation in the discovery cohort, we found tfs had comparable expression abundances with non-tfs in both luad and lusc datasets. highly coordinated tf pairs dominantly lost cooperativity during tumorigenesis, and those highly coordinated tf pairs in tumor were less disturbed than those in normal . we further identified dyscooperated tfs in these two datasets. the results showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> identified highly dyscooperated tfs in the discovery nsclc cohort were confirmed in the lusc and/or luad datasets . the irf family member, irf <dig>  was confirmed in both luad and lusc datasets. moreover, seven additional highly dyscooperated tfs were detected in both luad and lusc . additionally, the expression of irf8’s targets was more significantly altered than non-targets in tumor versus normal . repeated studies on the two independent datasets reproduced the findings from the discovery cohort, which demonstrate that the disruption of tf cooperativity is highly reproducible and biological meaningful in cancer.fig.  <dig> validation of dyscooperated irf <dig> in luad and lusc. a cooperativity alterations between tf pairs that highly coordinated in normal/tumor. b highly dyscooperated tfs also identified in the previous nsclc dataset. c comparison of expression alteration between irf8’s target and non-target genes



tumors progress through a series of stages, which is the most important factor in prognosis. we divided the lusc patients into different groups based on tumor stages and aggregated the cooperativity of irf <dig> in each individual group. we combined stage iii and iv together since there are only few samples in stage iv. as a result, we have  <dig> stage i,  <dig> stage ii, and  <dig> stage iii/iv samples, respectively. notably, we found that the cooperativity of irf <dig> was remarkably inversely correlated with tumor stages. as the tumor stage increasing, irf <dig> cooperation with other tfs became looser and looser , which indicates that irf <dig> cooperativity might play an important role in cancer development. more importantly, we investigated the survival contributions of irf <dig> cooperativity within each lusc stage. we divided patients into two groups according to survival time, long-survival and short-survival. we found that irf <dig> was more tightly cooperated with other tfs in patients with long survival than those with short survival within the same tumor stage . that is, the cooperativity of irf <dig> contributes to the survival of patients independent of tumor stage. these results demonstrated that the disruption of tf cooperation provides clinical utility for predicting patient survival.fig.  <dig> the irf <dig> cooperativity associated with tumor progression and patient survival. a irf <dig> loosens its cooperation with other tfs along with cancer progression in lusc. b irf <dig> is more loosely coordinated with other tfs in patients with poor survival within each lusc stage



CONCLUSIONS
we characterized the disrupted cooperation of transcription factors in cancer and identified common tfs whose cooperativity was highly disrupted across diverse cancer types. our findings underscore the far more important role of tf cooperativity in tumorigenesis than previously recognized. disrupted cooperation of tfs provides potential clinical utility as prognostic markers for predicting the patient survival.
