BACKGROUND
all eukaryotic organisms represent chimera from the fusion of free living independent organisms. in a process named endosymbiosis, an ancient host cell took up an α-proteobacterium in a process most likely driven by the advantage of obtaining greater metabolic flexibility in a variable and changing environment. the transformation from a bacterial symbiont to an endosymbiotic organelle was accompanied by a loss of cellular autonomy due to a massive gene transfer from the endosymbiont to the host cell. finally the endosymbiotic α-proteobacterium was converted into an organelle, which we know today as mitochondrion. this was followed by a second endosymbiotic event: the cell merging with an ancestral photosynthetic cyanobacterium, which gave rise to chloroplasts. due to their gram-negative like bacterial ancestors, both mitochondria and chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes, the inner and outer organellar membrane or envelope . the inner membrane of mitochondria and chloroplasts corresponds to the plasma membrane of the bacterial endosymbiont. but also the outer membrane shows typical remnants of bacterial origin. specifically the outer envelope of chloroplasts contains galactolipids and carotenoids found only in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria  <cit> . phosphatidylcholine , a typical eukaryotic lipid, is present only in the outer leaflet of the outer envelope  <cit> . proteins in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria traverse the membrane only with ß-sheets and not by hydrophobic α-helices  <cit> . many of the bacterial outer membrane proteins have a ß-barrel type structure forming so called porins, which form membrane channels for the uptake of ions and nutrients  <cit> . likewise, the outer membrane of mitochondria and chloroplasts contain ß-barrel type ion channels of bacterial origin, most prominently the protein import channels toc <dig> in chloroplasts and sam <dig> in mitochondria, which are phylogenetically related to omp <dig>  <cit> . further porin-like channels have been characterized in the past, e.g. voltage dependent anion channel  in mitochondria  <cit>  or the chloroplast outer envelope proteins   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which also form high conductance ß-barrel type ion channels  <cit> . on the other hand, typical host derived membrane components like pc in the outer leaflet of the chloroplast envelope or hydrophobic α-helical membrane proteins like oep <dig> indicate that the outer organellar membranes today represent a mixture of host and endosymbiont derived building blocks  <cit> .

the inner and outer chloroplast membranes delimit the organelle from the cytosol. they not only play key roles in the exchange of solutes and metabolites  <cit> , but house numerous enzymatic activities, e.g. for the synthesis of lipids and pigments  <cit> . their biochemical capacity as well as their role in intracellular communication and metabolic networking is therefore of prime interest and great physiological relevance. proteomic studies have identified about  <dig> polypeptides in the chloroplast envelope membranes in both c <dig> and c <dig> plants  <cit> . many of these proteins have still an unknown function and are poorly characterized. in recent years we have described a number of oeps sharing several characteristics, which can be used to select them from a pool of unknown proteins for further studies. these features are:i) lack of a predicted chloroplast targeting signal   <cit> ;

ii) high content of hydrophilic amino acids, because most channels have a ß-barrel type conformation and not hydrophobic α-helices;

iii) neutral or alkaline isoelectric point, like vdac, ompf, oep <dig>  oep <dig> or oep37;

iv) lack of predicted hydrophobic transmembrane helices.



when we combined these assumptions with published data  <cit>  as well as our own proteomic data from purified outer envelopes of pea chloroplasts  we were able to select several polypeptides for further studies, one of which is described here as oep <dig> 

RESULTS
identification of oep23
the peptide sequence obtained in our own proteomic analysis from purified outer envelopes of pea chloroplasts matched to a number of est pea contigs  <cit> , which in combination with the identified sequence of the arabidopsis homolog  could be used for the isolation and sequencing of a complete cdna sequence from pea . psoep <dig> has a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . oep <dig> homologs have been detected in the chloroplast proteome of arabidopsis  <cit> , pea  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . proteomic studies of chloroplast subfractions localized it further to the envelope membranes from arabidopsis  <cit> , pea  <cit>  and maize . neither a chloroplastic targeting signal nor hydrophobic peptide sequence could be detected, which is in line with the observation made by zybailov et al.  <cit> , who identified many plastidic proteins without predicted pre-sequence. a large part of oep <dig>  i.e. aa 48– <dig> in arabidopsis, is annotated as domain of unknown function  <dig> . this domain can be found in many bacterial proteins, but barely in eukaryotes, except the plant lineage . in soybean oep <dig>  is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues indicating a general involvement in chloroplast metabolism . the arabidopsis homolog at2g <dig> is not represented on the complete genome cdna microarray and can therefore not be assessed by publically available databanks. however, the protein has been detected in cotyledons, flowers, leaves and seeds .

conductance and gating behavior of psoep23
after addition of reconstituted oep <dig> to the bilayer chamber, a relatively large and characteristic channel activity with several sub-conductance states was observed . the channel had two main conductance states  of 382 ±  <dig> ps and 315 ±  <dig> ps at + <dig> and −100 mv, respectively . in some experiments  the channel exceeded the main conductance state, switching presumably to its fully open state  of 466 ±  <dig> ps and 424 ±  <dig> ps at + <dig> and −100 mv, respectively .figure  <dig> 
psoep <dig> shows channel activity. representative current traces of a bilayer containing a single active psoep <dig> channel. holding potential is set to + <dig> and −100 mv, respectively. the channel activity is characterized by short gating events from the open  to the sub-conductance state . some events are faster than the time resolution of the measurement which becomes apparent in the current histogram and a zoom into the trace. the electrolyte solution contained 250 mm kcl, 50 mm mops/tris ph  <dig>  .
psoep <dig> temporarily fully opens. current trace of a bilayer containing a single active oep <dig> channel at a holding potential of +100 mv. apart from the main open  and the sub-conductance state  the channel sometimes switched to its fully open state  and especially at holding potentials above +/−100 mv to the closed state . electrolyte solution 250 mm kcl, 50 mm mops/tris ph  <dig>  .



the gating behavior was characterized by frequent gating from either the main or the fully open state to a sub-conductance state  of 185 ±  <dig> ps and 128 ±  <dig> ps at + <dig> and −100 mv, respectively. the sub-conductance state might be divisible into several sub-states, but this was not further analyzed in detail. many of the gating events were shorter than the sampling interval of 100 μs , therefore were not resolved in time and thus only appeared as spikes in the current trace . the gating frequency fell into two modes i.e. a rapid gating activity with an average of 51 ±  <dig> events/s and a ~ <dig> times less frequent gating activity of 6 ±  <dig> events/s. these two different gating modes could not be assigned to a specific open state of the channel, but instead were observed at the main  and the fully open state . at holding potentials below ±100 mv complete closure events  were rarely observed and happened in a stochastic manner. the time the channel spent in the closed state could last from a few milliseconds up to even seconds . at holding potentials above ±100 mv the probability for a complete closure increased .

the channel had slightly rectifying properties, i.e. the conductance at −100 mv reached only about 70-90% of the value at +100 mv . on the basis of this rectification it became obvious that the channel inserted in a random orientation into the bilayer. for the analysis and the generation of the i/v curve data from  <dig> independent bilayers were accumulated in the way that the large conductance side was allocated to positive holding potentials.figure  <dig> 
verification of psoep <dig> orientation in a lipid bilayer. the i/v relationship revealed a slightly rectifying current of all open states. this rectification helps to identify the orientation of the channel after fusion with the bilayer, which was randomly distributed. for clarity the large conductance was always allocated to positive holding potentials. the data points represent the average of  <dig> independent experiments. electrolyte solution 250 mm kcl, 50 mm mops/tris ph  <dig>  .



in all experiments complete closure events happened instantaneously in one step and not in e.g. three sequential steps, which would be typical for trimeric beta-barrel proteins like ompf  <cit> . on the basis of this observation we assume that the psoep <dig> activity is a single channel unit and does not assemble into a multiple pore complex in our conditions. the conductance of the fully opened psoep <dig> is in the range of other oep proteins  <cit>  studied with a similar approach and in the same electrolyte conditions.

ion selectivity of psoep23
the channel displayed a pronounced cation selectivity with a reversal potential  of +46 mv in asymmetric electrolyte conditions . considering the activity coefficients of kcl this translates into a relative permeability ratio of k+ and cl− of  <dig> :  <dig> by using the goldmann-hodgkin-katz  equation .figure  <dig> 
psoep <dig> is cation selective. current response of a voltage ramp from − <dig> to +100 mv  in asymmetric electrolyte conditions . oep <dig> has a pronounced cation selectivity. the reversal potential  of +46 mv translates into a permeability ratio of k+: cl− of  <dig> :  <dig> by using the ghk equation and activities instead of concentrations.



to test the selectivity of psoep <dig> for different cation species we chose nacl and kcl electrolyte concentrations , which correspond to an activity of 175 mm . due to the lower diffusion coefficient of na+ ions in water, the bulk conductivity of 242 mm nacl reaches only 80% compared to the value of 250 mm kcl. with no preference for any cation species we would have expected a reduced channel conductance of 80% in symmetric 242 mm nacl in comparison to 250 mm kcl. in fact the conductance of psoep <dig> in nacl was even more reduced to 57 ± 4%, indicating a preference for k+ over na+ ions. in addition, in bi-ionic conditions of cis 242 mm nacl and trans 250 mm kcl, a reversal potential of erev + <dig>  mv was measured. by using the ghk equation and keeping the permeability coefficients of k+ and cl− constant, this corresponds to a permeability relation of k+ : na+ : cl− of  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig> . so the two independent approaches show a comparable preference of psoep <dig> for k+ ions over na+ ions. the relatively large conductance and pronounced, but not absolute cation selectivity is a typical feature of wide and water-filled pores, which are found in the outer membranes of bacteria and organelles of endosymbiotic origin  <cit> .

effect of added compounds
to further investigate the physiological role of psoep <dig> in the chloroplast membrane, we tested the influence of various compounds on the current of the channel. control conditions were 250 mm kcl, 50 mm mops/tris ph  <dig> . to ensure that a possible change was due to the compound itself and not to any indirect side-effect we checked the ph and the bulk conductivity of the electrolyte before and after addition of the corresponding compound. negatively charged compounds like malic acid or oxalacetate had no effect on the channel conductance, as it was also the case for adenine and thymine. the effects of the added compounds on channel activity are outlined in .table  <dig>

only spermidine and spermine at 5-10 mm induced a substantial reduction of single channel conductance while spermine alone also reduced the open probability. the bulk conductivity and ph were changed by max. 3% or  <dig>  units, respectively .

polyamines like spermine, which carries four positive charges at ph  <dig> , however reduced both the open channel conductance  by 22-51% and the overall open probability considerably at a concentration of  <dig> and 10 mm . as the effect was concentration dependent it is most likely that the polyamine directly blocks the pore of the channel or at least hinders the passage of other ions like k+. both sides and all open states of the channel were sensitive to the presence of spermine and the effect was completely reversible after perfusion of the measuring chambers . figure  <dig> shows a single channel in the fully open state at +100 mv and in main open state at −100 mv. in the presence of spermine both of these conductances are shifted to lower values , meaning that this current reduction is affecting the channel independently of its open conformation.figure  <dig>

spermidine  in the same concentration range  did cause neither an obvious change in gating behavior nor in the open probability, but still reduced the overall current through the channel even though to a lesser extent . cadaverine  and ornithine  did not produce a comparable effect on gating or open probability and only an insignificant change of the overall current .

the ph and the bulk conductivity after addition of up to 10 mm spermidine or spermine did not change significantly . therefore, the pronounced drop of channel conductance had to be attributed to a direct interaction of the compound with the channel protein.

we assume that the triple or quadruple positive charge of spermidine and spermine lead to a binding to the channel’s negative surface charge lining the pore, which might also be responsible for the overall cationic selectivity. thereby the passage of k+ would be gradually impaired and lead to a reduction and finally inhibition of current  <cit> . if spermine and spermidine can also pass the pore or whether they are hindered for steric or electrostatic reasons is not clear. however, it has been shown that polyamines like spermine and spermidine bind and plug various ion channels, but that blockage is voltage-dependent  <cit> . thus a strong depolarization could lead to the passage of spermine and spermidin through psoep <dig> as shown for other ion channels. since both polyamines have a long linear structure they might be able to pass even through narrow pores  <cit> . also the effects of polyamines on the conductance of larger pores like ompf  <cit>  and the translocase of the outer chloroplast membrane toc <dig> have been tested  <cit> . a potential physiological role of spermine flux across the mitochondrial membranes is summarized in  <cit> .

circular dichroism spectroscopy
to get an estimation of the overall secondary structure of psoep <dig> we measured the circular dichroism spectrum in several detergent and buffer conditions . after analyzing the spectra with four different algorithms the results were consistent with a secondary structure content of 42 ± 10% alpha-helix, 14 ± 5% beta-sheet, 16 ± 5% turns and 27 ± 5% of unordered structures . however, since psoep <dig> was purified from inclusion bodies it is possible that the confirmation of the reconstituted protein deviates from the native one even under different reconstitution conditions. nevertheless, these data indicate that in vitro reconstituted psoep <dig> channel is mostly formed by amphiphilic helices.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
proteomic analysis of cellular organelles and their sub-compartments are an increasingly rich source to identify and characterize proteins of so far unknown function. the chloroplasts outer envelopes form the direct boundary between the organelle and the surrounding cytosol. their membrane is extremely rich in polar lipids, but most of their protein components are yet poorly characterized. the outer envelope has not only transport functions for ions, metabolites  <cit>  or proteins  <cit> , but is also crucial for signal transduction between the organelle and the cell  <cit> . in addition it houses enzymes involved in galactolipid biosynthesis and other biosynthetic pathways . these multiple and very different biochemical functions make it clear that the plastid outer envelope membrane is not a more or less “static” remnant of the endosymbiotic process, but an active player in the biochemical and genetic network of the plant cell. the physiological function of psoep <dig> in vivo could not be clarified in this study, because no loss-of-function mutants are available. new techniques like the crispr/cas induced gene modification will enable us in the future to generate oep <dig> loss-of-function mutants in arabidopsis and analyze its molecular and architectural phenotype.
