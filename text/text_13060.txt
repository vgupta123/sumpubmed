BACKGROUND
since the first reports of the complete nucleotide sequences of the tobacco  <cit>  and liverwort  <cit>  chloroplast  genomes, a number of other land plant cp genomic sequences have been determined. these complete cp genomic sequences have enabled various comparative analyses, including phylogenetic studies, that are based on these data  <cit> . in contrast, however, the complete cp genome nucleotide sequences of only three gymnosperm species, cycas taitungensis  <cit> , pinus thunbergii  <cit> , and pinus koraiensis  <cit>  have been determined.

the cp genomes of gymnosperms, especially in coniferous species, have distinctive features compared with those of angiosperms, including paternal inheritance  <cit> , relatively high levels of intra-specific variation  <cit> , and a different pattern of rna editing  <cit> . generally, the cp genomes of angiosperms range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, and contain two identical inverted repeats  that divide the genomes into large  and small single copy  regions. the relative sizes of these lsc, ssc and irs remain constant, with both gene content and gene order being highly conserved  <cit> . on the other hand, the relative sizes of the gymnosperm irs vary significantly among taxa  <cit> ; for example, the irs of ginkgo biloba are  <dig> kbp  <cit> , those of cycas taitungensis are  <dig> kbp  <cit> , whereas those of pinus thunbergii are very short, at just  <dig> bp  <cit> . it has been suggested that, like p. thunbergii, some coniferous species also lack the large irs that exist in other gymnosperms  <cit> . this lack of irs is considered to have preceded the extensive genomic rearrangements of the conifer cp genome  <cit> . steane  <cit>  compared the complete cp genome of eucalyptus globulus with that of other angiosperm taxa and p. thunbergii, and found that the cp genome of p. thunbergii was arranged very differently to that of angiosperms. however, there is only limited information available about the cp genomic sequences of coniferous species, with the complete cp genome nucleotide sequences of only two species of pine, pinus thunbergii  <cit>  and pinus koraiensis  <cit>  in the family pinaceae, having been determined. the cp genomes of these two pine species were very similar in terms of both gene content and gene order and so provided little information about the complexity of the conifer cp genome.

in previous phylogenetic studies, of the four extant gymnosperm groups , the conifers were considered to be divisible into two distinct groups; a pinaceae group and a group consisting of five other families   <cit> . the cp nucleotide sequences from this five member group, excluding the pinaceae group, can provide interesting information about the conifer cp genome, not only in terms of genome structure but also concerning their evolutionary history. despite the lack of complete cp genome sequences from any family member of the cupressaceae sensu lato, tsumura et al.  <cit>  suggested, on the basis of physical maps and southern hybridization analyses, that the cp genome of cryptomeria japonica differs from that of other land plants, including pine species, in terms of genome size and gene order as well as in the absence of the large irs. thus, the complete cp genome sequence of c. japonica would drastically increase our understanding of the divergence of coniferous cp genome structures and gene content, and additionally clearly identify the differences with the pinaceae group.

there are two particular questions that need to be addressed using the complete cp genome sequence of c. japonica:  how different is the c. japonica cp genome from those of other plants, including gymnosperms, and  is the loss of the large irs involved with the instability and diversification of the cp genome, especially between coniferous groups? to respond to these questions, we present in this paper the complete nucleotide sequence of the cp genome of c. japonica , and compare its overall gene content and genomic structure with those of two other angiosperms , a liverwort , a fern , and two gymnosperms .

RESULTS
general characteristics of the c. japonica cp genome
the total size of the c. japonica cp genome was determined to be  <dig>  bp, which is larger than the cp genomes of both p. thunbergii  and m. polymorpha , but smaller than those of a. capillus , e. globulus , and c. taitungensis , and approximately the same size as that of o. sativa . this size is only slightly smaller than that previously estimated by rflp southern hybridization analysis  <cit> . the large ir region, which is found in other land plants except pinus, could also not be observed in the c. japonica cp genome, and so we were unable to define the large  and small  single copy regions in this genome. a total of  <dig> genes were identified in the c. japonica cp genome, of which  <dig> genes were single copy and two genes, trni-cau and trnq-uug, were duplicated and occurred as inverted repeat sequences. there were four ribosomal rna genes ,  <dig> individual transfer rna genes ,  <dig> genes encoding large and small ribosomal subunits , four genes encoding dna-dependent rna polymerases ,  <dig> genes encoding photosynthesis-related proteins , and  <dig> genes encoding other proteins, including those with unknown functions . among the  <dig> single copy genes,  <dig> genes contained introns, and three genes, clpp, trnt-ggu, and ycf <dig>  were identified as pseudogenes. the locations of the genes and pseudogenes are shown in figure  <dig>  and table  <dig> . the c. japonica cp genome has an at content of  <dig> %, which is higher than those of a. capillus , c. taitungensis , o. sativa , and p. thunbergii , similar to that of e. globulus , but lower than that of m. polymorpha .

a marked difference in gene content between gymnosperms including c. japonica
there are marked differences in several genes between gymnosperms, even though the c. japonica cp genome shares several common features with other plants, and some of these are described below. for example, there is considerable difference in gene content between c. japonica and p. thunbergii; the  <dig> intact ndh  genes found in c. japonica, as well as in five other plants, are absent from p. thunbergii  <cit> . the loss of these ndh genes is thought to be due to specific mutations in the pinus cp genome.

another functional gene, rps <dig>  which encodes a small ribosomal subunit, is found in the angiosperms, e. globulus and o. sativa, in the fern, a. capillus, and in gymnosperms, c. taitungensis and c. japonica . however, the location of rps <dig> is halfway between the trnk-uuu and chlb genes in the cp genome of gymnosperms, and halfway between matk and chlb, and between the trnk-uuu and trnq-uug genes in fern and angiosperms, respectively. in contrast, rps <dig> is completely absent from the m. polymorpha and p. thunbergii  <cit>  cp genomes, in addition to a large number of unrelated taxa of land plants, including connarus, epifagus, eucommia, fugus, krameria, linum, malpighia, passiflora, securidaca, turnera, viola, adonis, medicago, selaginella  <cit> . doyle et al.  <cit>  postulated the functional transfer of rps <dig> from the chloroplast to the nucleus in order to explain the absence of this gene in such a large number of unrelated taxa of land plants. similarly, the loss of rps <dig> and its functional transfer to the nucleus might have occurred independently in gymnosperms, especially in coniferous species.

the trnp-ggg and trnr-ccg genes are considered to be pseudogenes, possibly relics of plastid genome evolution in gymnosperms and moss  <cit> . the trnp-ggg gene is found in c. japonica, as well as in the two gymnosperms, p. thunbergii and c. taitungensis, in the liverwort, m. polymorpha, and in the fern, a. capillus, but not in angiosperm cp genomes. the gene is also found in gnetum and ginkgo of gymnosperms  <cit> , suggesting that this is a relic gene in a large number of gymnosperms. in contrast, the trnr-ccg gene, which is found in p. thunbergii, c. taitungensis, m. polymorpha, and a. capillus, is absent from the c. japonica and angiosperm cp genomes, suggesting that trnr-ccg is not conserved in all gymnosperm cp genomes and might have been completely lost in taxa, such as cupressaceae sensu lato, that have relatively recently diverged during the long evolutionary history of plants.

the trna gene, trnt-ggu, in the c. japonica cp genome contains only  <dig> bp of its 3' end and was therefore too short to form its complete secondary structure . furthermore, this trnt-ggu gene occurs as a single copy gene in the cp genomes of a. capillus, m. polymorpha, e. globulus, and o. sativa, is present as two copies in p. thunbergii, but is completely missing from the c. taitungensis cp genome. in pelagonium, the loss of trnt-ggu from its cp genome has been considered to be associated with genomic rearrangements  <cit> . although this relationship is considered further below, the duplication or incomplete lost of trna genes in p. thunbergii and c. japonica is also thought to be associated with genome rearrangements. however, the question remains as to why the trnt-ggu of c. taitungensis is completely lost despite the fact that no genomic rearrangements were found in comparison with standard cp genomes, such as of e. globulus.

diversification of genes in the c. japonica cp genome
the accd gene, which encodes acetyl-coa-carboxylase , is found in the cp genomes of all seven plants analyzed in this study, however, their reading frame lengths vary considerably. the reading frame length of the c. japonica cp genome is  <dig> codons, which is larger than that of a. capillus , m. polymorpha , p. thunbergii , and c. taitungensis  . the alignments do not include those of the angiosperms, e. globulus , and o. sativa , because of the complicated nature of the alignments. in monocot angiosperms, the accd reading frame length is reduced from  <dig> codons in o. sativa to zero in z. mays, and this reduction is considered to be the cause of accd loss in monocot species  <cit> . in contrast to this reduction, the accd reading frame in coniferous species, especially in cupressaceae sensu lato including c. japonica, may have diversified in an increasing direction.

the clpp gene, which encodes a proteolytic subunit of the atp-dependent clp protease, is found intact in the cp genomes of the six land plants, c. taitungeinsis, e. globulus, a. capillus, and m. polymorpha, with three exons and two introns, and in the p. thunbergii and o. sativa cp genomes with no introns  <cit> . however, in the c. japonica cp genome, only the second exon of the gene remains and so it occurs as a pseudogene. furthermore, the clpp gene is co-transcribed with the 5'-end of the rps <dig> gene and the rpl <dig> gene , so that the clpp to rpl <dig> gene order is extremely conserved in the cp genomes of all the land plants of this study. however, the clpp gene in the c. japonica cp genome is found halfway between the psbj and accd genes, and is clearly not co-transcribed with the rps12-5'end and rpl <dig> genes . as the loss of function of the clpp gene in the adonis annua cp genome is thought to be due to genome rearrangements   <cit> , it is possible that genome rearrangements are also the reason why clpp is a non-functional pseudogene in the c. japonica cp genome, as discussed further below.

although four major ycf genes have been partially characterized in the cp genomes of other land plants, their precise functions remain unclear to date. four ycf genes, ycf <dig>  ycf <dig>  ycf <dig>  and ycf <dig>  were also identified in the c. japonica cp genome. the highly conserved ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> are believed to be involved in the formation of photosystem i in chlamydomonas reinhardtii  <cit> . the deduced amino acid sequences of the ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> products show 81–96% and 71–76% sequence identity, respectively, with their homologues in other land plants. in contrast, ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> show considerable divergence relative to other land plants, with their deduced proteins having only 24–54%  and 25–37% sequence identity, respectively, with their homologues in other land plants. the two divergent ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> genes are thought to be involved in cellular metabolism or to play a structural role in plastids  <cit> . both the maize and rice cp genomes lack these two reading frames  <cit> , and the results from the present comparative analysis show that there are no regions homologous to ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> in c. japonica. furthermore, although the ycf <dig> gene of c. japonica shows 63% identity to that of p. thunbergii, the c. japonica ycf <dig> may not encode a protein. the ycf <dig> sequence, which occurs in the trni-gau intron, could represent a functional protein encoding gene in rice, corn, and pinus, although alignments of the ycf <dig> region in  <dig> angiosperms revealed that, in the majority of cases, it contained numerous frameshifts and stop codons  <cit> . similarly, we found numerous frameshifts and stop codons in the ycf <dig> region, although the c. japonica and c. taitungensis ycf <dig> regions have a comparatively high level of homology with that of p. thunbergii .

loss of large ir region within coniferous cp genomes
structural differences between cp genomes of c. japonica and other land plants
in addition to the loss of the large ir, genome rearrangements appear to have played an important role in the evolution of the coniferous cp genome. harr-plot analyses also indicate that the cp genome of c. japonica has lost its large ir and that its structure differs significantly from that of the cp genomes of the other six plants in terms of gene order. we estimated the minimum rearrangements via inversions in pairwise comparisons of cp genomes in order to determine the structural differences between cp genomes , even though inversions may not be the only mutational events causing gene order changes in the cp genome. a minimum of five inversions would be required to transform the gene structure of the gymnosperm c. taitungensis cp genome into that of the angiosperm e. globulus cp genome . in contrast, many genome rearrangements have occurred in the cp genomes of coniferous species within gymnosperms; we found that deletion of the large ir and a minimum of  <dig> inversions would be required to transform the gene structure of the c. taitungensis cp genome into that of c. japonica , and that deletion of the large ir and a minimum of seven inversions would be required to transform the gene structure of the c. taitungensis cp genome into that of p. thunbergii . furthermore, it is interesting to note that  <dig> inversions would be required to transform the gene structure of c. japonica into that of p. thunbergii .

* large inversions indicate an inversion event of the segment composed of two or more genes.

** one gene inversion indicates the inversion event of one gene.

the large ir is thought to stabilize the cp genome against major structural rearrangements  <cit> . among angiosperm species, structural changes in the cp genome have occurred within tribes of the legume family , which have also lost their ir, and so it appears that most genomes that have lost their irs have undergone more rearrangements than those that have not  <cit> . with respect to other conifers, it has been shown that douglas fir  and radiata pine  lack the large ir, and that both of these conifer genomes have undergone a greater number of rearrangements relative to ferns, angiosperms, and even ginkgo, a gymnosperm  <cit> . the differences in genome structure between c. japonica and other land plants, including pines, strongly confirms that the presence of large irs plays a role in the structural stability of the cp genome.

tsumura et al.  <cit>  suggested that the cp genome structure of c. japonica differs significantly from that of pine species, implying that independent changes have occurred and that no simple evolutionary path can be determined. in fact, phylogenetic studies have revealed the significant divergence of coniferales  <cit> , with a phylogenetic tree using the rbcl gene in one of these studies indicating that c. japonica  and pine species  are not very closely related and are in fact located in different clade . in a study of  <dig> campanulaceae species, cosner et al.  <cit>  suggested that data regarding cp genome rearrangements were useful for inferring phylogenetic relationships, and actually found that the results of analysis using gene order closely paralleled the results of phylogenetic analysis using internal transcribed spacer  and rbcl sequence data. hence, data on rearrangements in the conifer cp genome might reflect phylogenetic relationships and serve as a new evolutionary-related parameter. furthermore, insights obtained from these studies will provide a clearer detail of the process of cp genome evolution. however, in order to better understand the complex changes in the cp genome structure that have occurred during the long process of evolution, data on the cp genomes of other coniferous taxa, such as taxaceae, sciadopityaceae, podocarpaceae, and araucariaceae will be required.

the vestiges of genome rearrangement within the c. japonica cp genome
dispersed repetitive sequences with duplicated trna genes have been reported in the cp genomes of other pinus species  <cit> , and are associated with numerous dna rearrangements, including the loss of irs  <cit> . in addition, intact trna genes and dispersed repeats that are segments of trna sequences have a relationship with the inversion endpoints  <cit> , although not all inversion borders are near trna genes  <cit> . in this study, the gene order between psba or matk and trns-gcu in the cp genome of six other plants examined was highly conserved, whereas that of the c. japonica cp genome differed significantly from these six plants . assuming a c. taitungensis-like ancestral cp genome, we postulate an inversion event, which occurred at the segment from trnq-uug to trnt-ugu, to explain the cause of the duplicated trnq-uug gene .

within the large inversion from trnt-ugu to trnq-uug, we found another vestige of the genome rearrangement. as mentioned above, the incomplete loss of trnt-ggu  from the c. japonica cp genome may have been the result of genome rearrangement. in grasses, such as o. sativa, it has been suggested that rearrangements in the region surrounding trnt-ggu were derived from two independent inversions  <cit> . in the a. capillus cp genome, the segment from trnt-ggu to trng-gcc is inverted when compared to that of e. globulus. in the p. thunbergii cp genome, a translocation and inversion event occurred at the segment from trnt-ggu to the pseudogene ndhc . it is worth noting that trnt-ggu is located at the borders of the sites of the genome rearrangements. although the rearrangement associated with trnt-ggu was not found in the c. japonica cp genome when compared to that of e. globulus, the incomplete loss of trnt-ggu in the c. japonica cp genome suggests the possibility of a re-inversion event.

furthermore, the gene order between the clpp and trnv-uac genes is extremely conserved among the six other land plants studied, whereas that of the c. japonica cp genome is significantly different . within the trnn-guu to chll gene segment of the c. japonica cp genome, we identified three inverted repeats and one direct repeat which were  <dig> bp or longer and showed a sequence identity of at least 90%, together with a duplicated partial trnl-caa gene . we infer that these repetitive sequences are associated with the inversion and translocation events, because the repetitive sequences were not observed in the other six plant cp genomes and they coincided with rearrangement endpoints that were significantly different from the six other plant cp genomes. however, it is difficult to unequivocally establish the process of genome rearrangement in the c. japonica cp genome based solely on the positional information of these repetitive sequences. in particular, we cannot infer why several repetitive sequences are concentrated within the region between trnl-caa and ycf <dig> .

we described above the relationship between the clpp pseudogene, within the trnn-guu gene to chll gene segment, and genome rearrangements. in the adonis annua cp genome  <cit> , the functions of the clpp gene are thought to have been lost as a result of genome rearrangement . in the peta to clpp region of the c. japonica cp genome, assuming a c. taitungensis-like ancestral cp genome, we can construct a genome rearrangement model in which a minimum of three inversions would be required to transform the gene order of the c. taitungensis cp genome into that of c. japonica . the clpp pseudogene in the c. japonica cp genome was apparently caused by such genome rearrangements, and the repetitive sequences halfway between psbj and clpp, and between ccsa and peta in the c. japonica cp genome should therefore be vestiges of the genome rearrangements.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has revealed that the coniferous species, c. japonica, has a distinct cp genome compared to previously reported land plant cp genomes. in terms of gene content, several genes in the c. japonica cp genome differ significantly, having either been lost or diverged, from those of other land plants, while the gene order and genome structure also differ significantly. the deleted large irs and the numerous genome rearrangements that have occurred in the c. japonica cp genome have provided new insights into the evolutionary lineage of conifers. however, as the complete cp genome nucleotide sequences of only three conifer species that belong to two distinct genera have been determined, our present results will certainly advance our understanding of the complex evolutionary history of the coniferous cp genome.
