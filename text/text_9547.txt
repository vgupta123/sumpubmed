BACKGROUND
anti-idiotype vaccination represents an innovative approach to target tumor-associated antigen-expressing cells. this approach comes directly from jerne's idiotypic network theory, which postulates that due to the huge potentiality for diversity of the immunoglobulin variable regions, the idiotype repertoire can mimic the universe of self and foreign epitopes  <cit> .

neugc-containing gangliosides are attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy because these glycolipids are non-self antigens in humans  <cit> . in contrast, they have been detected in different human tumors by antibodies and chemical analysis  <cit> . recent experimental data suggest that n-glycolyl-gm <dig> ganglioside  is relevant for tumor biology  <cit> .

mab-1e <dig>  <cit>  is an igg <dig> anti-idiotype  mab obtained by immunizing balb/c mice with mab-p <dig>   <cit>  coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin  in the presence of freund's adjuvant. this ab <dig> inhibited the binding of mab-p <dig> to neugcgm <dig> ganglioside. mab-1e <dig> induced an idiotype-positive antigen-negative  ab <dig> response in syngeneic, allogeneic and xenogeneic models, where neugc-containing gangliosides are normally expressed  <cit> . in contrast, in chicken, where like in humans neugc-containing gangliosides are not expressed in normal tissues, mab-1e <dig> was capable of inducing a specific ab <dig> antibody response against these gangliosides   <cit> . similar results have been obtained in cancer patients immunized with al3-precipitated mab-1e <dig>  <cit> . the results of these clinical trials evidenced that the vaccine was well-tolerated and immunologically active. in addition, al3-precipitated mab-1e <dig> immunization induced a pronounced anti-metastatic effect in different murine tumor models  <cit> .

for phase i and ii clinical trials, mab-1e <dig> was produced in mice ascites, a common practice in the 1990's for small scale antibody production.

we developed a new bioreactor-based method using protein-free media for the production of mab-1e <dig>  the mab-1e <dig> produced from bioreactors  has to be bioequivalent to ascites fluid-produced 1e <dig>  in order to ensure the same effect in the patients. in this case, this bioequivalence has to be demonstrated by a set of physicochemical and biological methods as required by regulatory authorities for characterization of mabs  <cit> . as mab-1e <dig> is used as an adjuvated vaccine additional characteristics should be taken in to account.

defining the molecular similarity of two mabs can be difficult due to their inherent heterogeneity. apart from the primary sequence, it has been established that glycosylation can be critical for the biological function of mabs  <cit> . product-related substances or impurities such as deamidated, isomerized, and oxidized forms, or protein aggregates  <cit>  that may be introduced during cloning and production processes can affect, both, the mabs' tertiary structure and antigen-binding properties. therefore, a detailed characterization has special relevance for idiotypic vaccines, where the correct spatial atomic distribution in the complementarity-determining regions  is critical for their biological activity.

here, we present the detailed molecular and immunological characterization of mab-1e <dig> obtained by two different production methods in order to determine the impact of the manufacturing process in vaccine performance.

RESULTS
n-terminal pyroglutamic acid, asn glycosylation and three deamidation sites common for 1e10-af and st, while oxidized methionine found only in 1e10-st
primary structure was determined by mass spectrometry using both maldi-tof <dig> and esi-qtof for ms <dig> measurements. the 1e <dig> amino acid sequence remained unaltered during stirred tank fermentation or production in ascites fluid. post-translational modifications detected were heavy chain n-terminal pyroglutamic acid, n-glycosylation and the oxidation of methionine  <dig> , as summarized in table  <dig> 

+ modified.-non modified

one common post-translational modification observed in mabs is a cyclized n-terminal glutamine  <cit>  when either the heavy and/or light chain sequences begin with glutamine. this reaction involves the cyclization of the n-terminal amine and the subsequent loss of nh <dig> . the gene sequence of the heavy and light chains of many mabs codes for an n-terminal glutamine, but upon sequencing the n-terminal amino acid is predominantly found as the cyclized pyro-glutamic acid form  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the ms <dig> mass spectrum of the n-terminal peptide from heavy chain which bears the cyclized pyro-glutamic acid form of glutamine. regardless the source, ascites or stirred tank, all the heavy chain n-terminal glutamines were found as pyro-glutamic acid, exclusively.

methionine oxidation is a chemical modification known to change the stability and conformation of mabs through altering ch <dig> and ch <dig> domain structure  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the oxidation in residue met <dig>  which is a conserved residue located at ch <dig> of igg <dig> antibodies, near to the region of interaction between ch <dig> and ch <dig> domains. this oxidation affects the overall charge and stability of the antibody  <cit> .

deamidation has been shown to be one of the major chemical degradation mechanisms in protein pharmaceuticals during production and storage  <cit>  three sites of asn deamidation were found for mab-1e <dig>  two of these were found in the constant region of the light chain and the other one in the constant region of heavy chain, two of these sites were also observed by harris et al.  <cit>  studying mma <dig> anti-idiotypic antibody.

very low amounts of aggregates in 1e10-af and st, but low molecular weight fragments present only in 1e10-af
aggregation analysis  revealed one major peak corresponding to > 98% monomeric 1e10-st eluting at a retention volume of  <dig>  ml. additionally, a small amount of dimers  seemed to be present . 1e10-af showed two major peaks corresponding to > 91% monomeric 1e <dig> eluting at a vret of  <dig>  ml and  <dig> % of mab fragments  were determined. dimers seemed to be < 1% .

aggregates have been reported to cause immunogenicity in a t cell-independent pathway  <cit> . as aggregates comprise a large number of individual protein molecules, there is the potential for the surface to display a "repetitive" array of epitopes that may be seen by the immune system as resembling the external surfaces of pathogens, triggering the pattern recognition receptors  on apcs. this t-cell-independent pathway leads to an igm response. however, b cells activated by protein aggregates could function as apcs to recruit t cell help and thereby switch to an igg response. although b cells are relatively poor apcs, their presentation potential is enhanced following specific recognition of antigen, thus contributing to initiation of t cell responses  <cit> .

among the various product-related impurities and degradation products, aggregation is considered a strong risk factor for immunogenicity. it is also the attribute most difficult to control, because there are multiple factors that can lead to the formation of aggregates in a product  <cit> .

charge profile of 1e10-st different from 1e10-af even after c-terminal lysine removal
cation-exchange chromatography has been introduced to measure charge heterogeneity, in particular caused by lysine variants, more than  <dig> years ago  <cit>  and now is widely accepted in pharmaceutical analysis. we detected a complex charge variety for both molecules consisting of clusters of charged species . 1e10-af remained unaltered after enzymatic removal of c-terminal lysine while in 1e10-st the charged species changed dramatically. the shape of the wcx chromatograms and the changes observed after enzymatic treatment for both 1e10-af and 1e10-st suggested a complete processing of c-terminal lysine in 1e10-af, while the 1e <dig> obtained from the stirred tank process was found to yield three charged populations of c-terminal lysine processing denoted in figure  <dig> as  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . charged species present on each cluster  can result from posttranslational modifications like asparagine deamidation, n-teminal pyroglutamic acid and methionine oxidation determined by mass spectrometry. harris et al  <cit>  reported similar findings as potential sources for the significant charge heterogeneities in mab-mma <dig>  an anti-idiotypic murine igg <dig> mab. in that study c-terminal lysine variants, proteolysis, and deamidation of light chain asn <dig> and heavy chain asn <dig> were identified to be responsible for mab-mma <dig> charge heterogeneity.

same sugar structures attached to fc of 1e10-af and st but not their relative amount
detailed n-glycosylation was investigated by n-glycan mapping of fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharides released from the mabs. the 2-ab-labeled glycans, released from mabs by pngase f, were separated using hydrophilic interaction chromatography  with fluorescence detection for quantification. the n-glycans identified were core-fucosylated biantennary-complex-type oligosaccharides. using gu values  <cit> , the most intense peaks were identified as agalactosylated core-fucosylated biantennary  and monogalactosylated core-fucosylated biantenary  structures, respectively. minor peaks with higher retention times were determined to be core-fucosylated mono- and di-sialylated biantennary structures, respectively.

oligosaccharide structures were determined to be similar for both mab molecules. six major glycans  were identified and quantified. figure 5a shows a relative quantification based on relative peak areas of 2ab-labeled hplc chromatograms. as expected, g0f, g1f and g <dig> were the most highly represented glycoforms in both mab-1e <dig>  while sialylated glycoforms were less. glycosylation patterns of 1e10-st and af were determined to be different in their ratios of glycan structures. however, they exhibited the same glycan structures attached to asn <dig> of heavy chain. compared to 1e10-af, bioreactor-produced mab contained more g <dig> and displayed a two-fold increase in sialylated forms. the glycan pattern of 1e10-af can be a result from enzymatic trimming of oligosaccharides by glycosidases present in ascites fluid. however, the 1e10-st glycan pattern may have resulted from differences in specific production rates of hybridoma cells during fermentation. at high production rates, mab oligosaccharides result incomplete, while at low production rates, more complete structures are produced.

igg glycosylation plays a crucial role in antibody effector functions like cell-dependent cytotoxicity , antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity , and fcγr recognition. as the intended use of mab-1e <dig> is to be administered as a vaccine, adsorbed to alum, and injected subcutaneously, it is very unlikely that fc-mediated effector functions plays a critical role in the biological activity of this mab. however, conformation of igg is affected by glycosylation  <cit> . on the other hand, it is well known that murine cells can attach highly immunogenic sugar epitopes like αgal-gal and n-glycolyl sialic acid  <cit> . as the n-glycan structures of 1e10-af and st were identical, and so far none of these epitopes has been detected, differences in immunogenicity and safety between 1e10-af and st are not expected.

reduced thermal stability of 1e10-st as compared to 1e10-af
thermally induced structural transitions in the secondary structure monitored by infrared spectroscopy have been previously described  <cit>  to analyze the unfolding behavior of proteins and to determine a melting temperature . as structural transition to intermolecular β-sheets occur regardless of the initial secondary structure composition of the native protein, these bands can be used to monitor protein aggregation in aqueous solution and solid state  <cit> . the melting point can be determined by plotting the ratio of the intensities of characteristic amide i bands vs. temperature  <cit> . 1e10-af and 1e10-st displayed a different behavior under temperature stress . while 1e10-af remained in solution, 1e10-st started melting at approximately 73°c. one explanation for the lower thermal stability of 1e10-st might be the oxidized met <dig> in 1e10-st, which was not detectable in 1e10-af. this residue is located on ch <dig> domain, near to the interaction site of ch <dig> and ch <dig>  therefore, it may be hypothesized that oxidation of this residue can affect the three dimensional structures of ch <dig> and ch <dig> and herewith the overall stability of the antibody. in summary, the thermal stability for mab-1e <dig> obtained in stirred tank fermentation was lower than mab-1e <dig> obtained in ascites fluid, supported by several factors including methionine oxidation, differences in glycan patterns, charge state heterogeneities, and protein conformation.

similar ab <dig> antibody responses elicited by 1e10-af and st vaccination in chicken
we compared the specificity of the antibodies generated in chicken by immunization with 1e10-af and st. antibody responses were tested in the sera obtained from the animals after the immunization. all chicken developed a strong humoral response against the whole mab-1e <dig> molecules. the titers of ab <dig> responses were higher than 1/ <dig> , as measured by elisa . the reactivity of animal sera with the murine isotype-matched mab was also tested, and a higher binding to the immunizing mab-1e <dig> was observed in the chicken sera independently of the source of anti-idiotype mab  . this result demonstrated the immunodominance of the idiotype of both mab-1e <dig> products in the antibody response induced in immunized chicken. moreover, there was no difference in the serological antibody titers obtained when the animals were immunized with 1e10-af or 1e10-st  , evidencing the same immunogenicity for these two mab-1e <dig> molecules. thus, the structural changes observed did neither affect overall immunogenicity nor the idiotypic immunodominance reported for this mab  <cit> .

co-administration of 1e10-af/alum or 1e <dig> st/alum with low-dose cyclophosphamide induced anti-tumor effects in a mammary carcinoma model
as shown in figure  <dig>  no antitumor effect was observed when low-dose cyclophosphamide or 1e10-st/alum was administered alone at the evaluated dose. interestingly, when 1e10-af/alum or 1e10-st/alum was co-administered with low-dose cyclophosphamide f3ii mammary carcinoma growth was reduced significantly. no statistical differences in tumor growth between these groups of mice were determined and the observed anti-tumor responses were comparable with the effect upon co-administration of the standard high-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer based on  <dig> mg/m <dig> of doxorubicin and  <dig> mg/m <dig> of cyclophosphamide.

in vivo experiments resulted in similar immunogenicity, idiotypic dominance, and antitumor effects of 1e10-af and 1e10-st. thus, the observed posttranslational modifications did most likely not affect the fab structure, as the biological activity of 1e <dig> vaccine was not altered. moreover, deamidation of asparagine and methionine oxidation were restricted to fc regions in 1e <dig> mab, far away from cdrs. therefore, it remains unlikely that these amino acid modifications might affect the spatial conformation of the respective cdrs enabling structural mimicry as postulated for anti-idiotypic mabs.

CONCLUSIONS
effector functions of classic therapeutic monoclonal antibodies can be divided in fab-dependent functions and fc-dependent functions. the fab region contains variable regions of light and heavy chains which are responsible for antigen recognition, while the fc region mediates effector functions like cdc, adcc and fcγr recognition. therefore, any change in their physicochemical profile could eventually affect the efficacy of mabs.

it is well known that physicochemical properties of recombinant proteins can be heavily affected during changes in the production process. thus, it is mandatory to carefully investigate the similarities and differences of therapeutic mabs when the production process has been changed. comparability must be demonstrated by an array of physicochemical and biological methods as required by the regulatory authorities.

regulatory aspects regarding physicochemical characteristics of idiotypic monoclonal antibodies used for idiotypic vaccination bear some differences from classic therapeutic mabs. for idiotypic mabs, fc-related functions are not critical for the intended biological effect as they are administered adsorbed to alum and via intra-dermis. antigen mimicry is restricted to variable region cdrs which are located in fab.

here, we demonstrate that change of 1e <dig> production from ascites to bioreactor generates a molecule with different physicochemical properties. changes were observed in the degree of asparagine deamidation, c-terminal lysine processing, methionine oxidation, and glycosylation pattern. all these modifications had an impact on the charge profile and conformation of the 1e <dig> molecule, as revealed by an altered thermal stability of 1e10-st. however, these changes did not affect its biological activity. the idiotypic dominance was not affected, which represents the intended effect for an idiotypic vaccine. thus, the transfer in the production process of 1e <dig> idiotypic mab from ascites to bioreactor improved product safety without affecting its biological activity. furthermore, our study demonstrated a number of physicochemical properties that do not affect the biological activity of 1e <dig> idiotypic vaccine.
