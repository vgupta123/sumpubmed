BACKGROUND
renal interstitial fibrosis  is a common manifestation in progressive renal diseases leading to functional deterioration and eventual loss of renal function, irrespective of the nature of the initial renal injury  <cit> . activation of tubulointerstitial myofibroblast leads to the production of excessive extracellular matrix with a predominance of interstitial collagens, and plays a critical role in the progression of chronic renal diseases  <cit> . emerging evidence suggests that myofibroblasts can be derived from tubular epithelial cells through the process of epithelial-to mesenchymal transition  during the progression to renal fibrosis  <cit> . transforming growth factor-beta <dig>  has been proposed to be the major regulator in inducing emt and renal fibrosis  <cit> , mainly via the tgf-β/smads signal transduction pathway  <cit> . despite emt contributes to the disease progression, several studies have suggested that emt of the tubular epithelial cell can be reversible  <cit> .

danshen  is a popular traditional chinese herb widely used in treating cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic diseases by improving circulation and resolving stasis  <cit> . salvianolic acid b  , also known as lithospermates b or tanshinoate b, is a major water soluble component extracted from sm, which was well recognized as an antioxidative agent and free radical scavenger, involved in the protection of various cells, including nerve cells and hepatocytes  <cit> . it was reported that sm and its aqueous extract, sal b, produced a good effect in treating patients and animals with chronic renal diseases. they could improve renal function in uremic rats through the activation of kallirein and the promotion of prostaglandin e <dig> production  <cit> . moreover, recent research showed that sal b can prevent tgf-β1-induced emt of human kidney cell lines in vitro  <cit> . our previous studies showed that sal b had obvious therapeutic effects against liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis b  <cit>  and animal models induced by dimethylnitrosamine  <cit> , and its mechanism was closely associated with the inhibition of hepatic stellate cell activation through the regulation of tgf-β/smads signaling  <cit> . moreover, our recent study found that sal b can prevent rif induced by mercuric chloride  in rats, with the mechanism associated with anti-oxidative injury  <cit> .

although the pivotal role of tubular emt in rif is widely accepted  <cit> , a recent controversial report discussing the epithelial origin for myofibroblast in vivo  <cit>  suggests that emt in vivo may be different from emt in vitro. therefore it is definitely worthwhile to evaluate the effect of sal b on tubular emt in vivo as well as in vitro and probe its underlying mechanism of action in order to obtain more solid evidence of sal b's action on tubular emt and better understand its mechanism. in this study, we observed the effects of sal b on renal tubular emt in vivo and in vitro and investigated sal b's underlying mechanism of action against emt in renal tubular epithelial cells relating to the tgf-β/smads signal pathway. the results demonstrate that sal b can prevent tubular emt in the fibrotic kidney induced by hgcl <dig> as well as human proximal tubular epithelial cells  after being triggered by tgf-β <dig>  the mechanism of action is closely related to the regulation of the tgf-β <dig> signaling pathway via the inhibition of tgf-β <dig> expression, suppression of tgf-β type i receptor  expression and function, down-regulation of smad2/ <dig> phosphorylation, and restoration of the down-regulation of smad <dig> by tgf-β <dig>  as well as the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  activity in diseased kidneys.

RESULTS
 <dig>  sal b ameliorated renal interstitial fibrosis induced by hgcl <dig> in rats
the excessive and disorganized deposition of collagens is a major pathogenic feature of fibrotic diseases. hgcl <dig> induced an increased amount of collagen formation in the masson's trichrome-stained kidney sections. in contrast, collagen levels diminished in sal b and vitamin e  treated fibrotic kidneys .

hydroxyproline  content is a specific marker for collagen synthesis. the results showed that hyp content in kidney increased significantly in the model group when compared with the normal group. in contrast, sal b and vit e treatments significantly decreased kidney hyp content of model rats. there was no significant difference in hyp content between sal b and vit e groups .

 <dig>  effects of sal b on the expressions of alpha smooth muscle actin  and e-cadherin in kidneys of model rats
immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the expression of α-sma was very weak in the renal tubule and interstium of normal kidneys, whereas it was prominent in model rats. on the other hand, epithelial cell marker, e-cadherin, was markedly decreased in the tubular epithelium of model groups compared with the normal group. sal b treatment attenuated the increased expression of α-sma in fibrotic kidneys. moreover, e-cadherin expression was maintained in response to sal b treatment . therefore, the disruption of the tubular basement membrane was ameliorated with sal b treatment. vit e had the same effects. this observation may indicate that sal b inhibits the process of emt in fibrotic kidneys, as characterized by the transition from the epithelial to the mesenchymal phenotype.

consistent with the immunohistochemistry studies, western blot analysis revealed increased α-sma and decreased e-cadherin expression in the kidneys of model group rats when compared with the normal group. in contrast, sal b and vit e treatments significantly inhibited the up-regulation of α-sma and the down-regulation of e-cadherin. howerer, the effect of sal b was significantly more pronounced than vit e. .

 <dig>  sal b treatment attenuated the increase in tgf-β <dig>  tβr-i, and smad2/ <dig> phosphorylation in kidneys of model rats
tgf-β1/smads signaling is known to play a major role in the process of tgf-β1-induced emt. the results demonstrated that there was no significant change in smad <dig> and smad <dig> expression between each group, while the expression of phosphorylated smad <dig> and smad <dig>  tgf-β <dig>  and tβr-i was significantly increased in kidneys of rats in the model group when compared with those of the normal group. conversely, sal b treatments significantly attenuated the up-regulation of tgf-β <dig>  tβr-i, p-smad <dig>  and p-smad <dig> .

 <dig>  sal b down-regulated the activity of mmp- <dig> in kidneys of model rats
disruption of the tubular basement membrane  is a key event essential for emt at the cellular level, and mmp- <dig> can degrade tbm proteins such as type iv collagen, leading to the initiation of tubular emt. the activity of mmp- <dig> in kidney tissue was assessed using gelatin zymography. as shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of mmp- <dig> was increased in rats of the model group when compared with that of the normal group. sal b and vit e significantly down-regulated the activity of mmp- <dig>  

 <dig>  effects of sal b on cell viability and toxicology of hk- <dig> cells
cell viability was determined by the alamarblue assay. the results were expressed as the percentage of reduction in alamarblue.  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b had no significant effect  on cell viability during each incubation period, whereas  <dig> μm of sal b decreased the viability of hk- <dig> cells by 11%  and 20%  when compared to control cells after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of incubation, respectively .

to investigate the cytotoxicity of sal b on hk- <dig> cells, cells were treated with a wide range of sal b doses from  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm. after  <dig> h of incubation, we found no obvious changes in nuclear morphology, membrane permeability, or lysosomal mass/ph with  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b treatments in comparison with control cells. however,  <dig> μm of sal b showed an obvious cytotoxicity to cells, reflected by fewer nuclei and an increase in the membrane permeability as shown by the indicator dye. therefore,  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b were considered to be safe doses for treating cells .

 <dig>  sal b treatment blocked tgf-β1-induced emt in hk- <dig> cells
 sal b prevented the loss of e-cadherin and cytokeratin- <dig>  expressions and inhibited α-sma expression induced by tgf-β <dig> in hk- <dig> cells
e-cadherin is a tubular epithelial cell-cell adhesion receptor that is essential for the formation and maintenance of renal epithelial homeostasis and architecture  <cit> . we found that tgf-β <dig> significantly suppressed e-cadherin mrna expression in hk- <dig> cells, while  <dig> and  <dig> μm of sal b prevented the loss of its expression .

consistent with the alteration in e-cadherin mrna expression, both immunofluorescence and western blot analyses showed that ck- <dig>  an epithelial cell marker, was significantly down-regulated after tgf-β <dig> treatment and was then reversed by  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b treatments .

on the other hand, α-sma  expression was increased significantly after tgf-β <dig> incubation, as detected by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses, while  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b treatments significantly attenuated its expression .

 sal b blocked the transformation of cell morphology and f-actin reorganization induced by tgf-β1
concomitant with the alterations in e-cadherin, ck- <dig>  and α-sma expressions as described above, we found that  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b blocked tubular epithelial cells from taking on a myofibroblastic appearance induced by tgf-β <dig>  hk- <dig> cells possess a cobblestone appearance when grown in culture, but they become elongated and take on a spindle shape in response to tgf-β <dig>  co-incubation of sal b with tgf-β <dig> restored the epithelial morphology of these cells .

the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in defining cell shape and morphology  <cit> . in this study, we also examined f-actin reorganization during the conversion from tubular epithelium to myofibroblasts after tgf-β <dig> administration. the results revealed that tgf-β <dig> induced significant f-actin reorganization, forming abundant long stress fibers in hk- <dig> cells.  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b blocked these processes .

 sal b down-regulated mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> activation induced by tgf-β <dig> in hk- <dig> cells
tgf-β <dig> can promote mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> activation in mesangial cells and fibroblasts, and augment tissue remodeling and fibrogenesis  <cit> . in this study, zymographic analysis of conditioned media indicated that tgf-β <dig> induced pro-mmp- <dig> and its activation, as well as mmp- <dig> secretion.  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b significantly decreased mmp-2/ <dig> activities. .

 <dig>  sal b treatment attenuated tgf-β1-induced tβr-i and smad2/ <dig> phosphorylation and up-regulated smad <dig> expression in hk- <dig> cells
as a mechanistic experiment for the effects of sal b, we examined the influence of sal b on the tgf-β1-smads signaling, which is known to play a major role in tgf-β1-induced emt. the results demonstrated that there was no significant change between each group in smad2/ <dig>  but the expression of phosphorylated smad2/ <dig> and tβr-i was significantly increased after incubation with tgf-β <dig>  conversely,  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b as well as sb- <dig> treatments significantly attenuated the tgf-β1-induced up-regulation of p-smad2/ <dig> and tβr-i .

likewise, the expression of smad <dig>  a negative regulator of tgf-β <dig> signaling, was reduced after tgf-β <dig> stimulation, while  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm of sal b up-regulated its expression .

discussion
rif is the common pathway in chronic renal diseases regardless of the initial cause. therefore preventing rif could slow down the pace of renal function deterioration  <cit> . recent documents show that hepatocyte growth factor , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors , and erythropoietin all could antagonize rif and improve renal function  <cit> . traditional chinese medicine has a rich history of treating chronic renal diseases over thousands of years, and some herbal medicine and extracts have proven to contain anti-renal fibrosis properties both in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit> . it is well recognized that tubular epithelial cells could differentiate into myofibroblasts via a process referred to as emt, which plays a pivotal role in renal interstitial fibrogenesis  <cit> . since specific therapies of preventing the progression of chronic renal diseases are still lacking, seeking drug candidates or herbal compounds that can effectively prevent or inhibit emt would represent one of the main strategies in the treatment of rif.

tubular emt is a process during which renal tubular epithelial cells lose their epithelial phenotype and acquire new mesenchymal features and consists of four correlated steps with highly regulated mechanisms  <cit> :  loss of epithelial cell adhesion through down-regulation of e-cadherin.  de novo α-sma expression and actin reorganization, which may provide a structural foundation not only for defining the morphology of the transformed cells, but also for them to migrate, invade, and even acquire the capacity for contractility.  disruption of tubular basement membrane, and  enhanced cell migration and invasion. the latter  <dig> steps are mainly regulated by increased activities of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> which would specifically break down native type iv collagen and laminin, the principal proteins found in the tbm, thereby disrupting tbm structural and functional integrity. although recent evidence with genetic manipulation indicates that kidney epithelial cells do not become myofibroblasts in vivo  <cit> , most documents still support the phenomenon of tubular emt and its important role in renal fibrogenesis  <cit> .

in this study, we found that α-sma expression was increased significantly around tubules in the fibrotic kidney induced by hgcl <dig>  using immmunohistochemistry staining, when compared with the normal kidney. in contrast, e-cadherin expression decreased around tubular areas. although we have not confirmed if these α-sma positive tubular cells come from the epithelium or whether they can synthesize collagen, the increased α-sma expression around tubules and mmp- <dig> activity in kidney support emt in vivo. also, the in vitro results clearly show that human proximal tubular epithelial cells, represented by the hk- <dig> cell line, had undergone emt after tgf-β <dig> incubation, as evidenced by the loss of e-cadherin, activation of α-sma, acquisition of a spindle-like morphology, f-actin re-organization, and an increase in the activities of mmp2/ <dig>  more interestingly, sal b could inhibit tubular emt in fibrotic kidneys, as evidenced by the reversal of increased α-sma and decreased e-cadherin expression, as well as preventing renal collagen deposition and fibrosis.

vit e is a potential antioxidant agent and can prevent organ fibrosis  <cit> . in our previous study, we found that chronic mercury intoxication induced rif with obvious characteristics of oxidative stress through the depletion of intracellular thiols  <cit> . vit e exhibited anti-renal fibrosis effects through its mechanism of action, which protects the kidney from oxidative injury. here we used vit e as a control as well, and the results showed that vit e also blocked emt in vivo, but the effects were not as strong as sal b. with the emt cell model induced by tgf-β <dig> in hk- <dig>  our data in vitro demonstrated that sal b blocked emt in hk- <dig> cells, and these results are consistent with our in vivo results as well as in vitro results from other reports  <cit> . however, in our experiment, reasonable dosages f sal b  were utilized, which produced no obvious toxicity, and were used effectively in other experiments  <cit> . in addition, sb- <dig>  <cit> , a potential and specific inhibitor of tβr-i kinase was used as an active control. the results revealed that sal b, as well as sb- <dig>  significantly reversed emt induced by tgf-β <dig> in hk- <dig> cells, as evidenced by the restoration of diminished e-cadherin and ck- <dig> expression, blockage of α-sma expression, cell morphology transformation, f-actin reorganization, and down-regulation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> activation. these data not only confirms sal b's effects in preventing or reversing tubular emt in vivo and in vitro, but also implies a mechanism of action involved with the regulation of mmp-2/ <dig>  mmp-2/ <dig>  in particular mmp- <dig>  have pivotal roles in initiating renal fibrosis by degrading tbm components and disrupting its integrity  <cit> . it was reported that genetic expression of active mmp- <dig> in the renal proximal tubule is sufficient to generate the entire spectrum of emt in the absence of superimposed injury. the rat rif model induced by hgcl <dig> displayed a remarkable feature of oxidative stress, which could promote mmp- <dig> expression and activity  <cit> . our previous studies showed that sal b had anti-oxidant effects, and in this study, we found that sal b can also inhibit mmp- <dig> activity in the diseased kidney and subsequently protect tubular basement membrane and prevent emt and renal fibrosis.

tgf-β <dig> is the most potent inducer in initiating and completing the entire emt course  <cit> . its biological responses are primarily dependent on regulation via the tβr and smads signaling pathway. tgf-β <dig> signals are transduced by transmembrane serine/threonine kinase type i and type ii receptors, as well as intracellular mediators known as smads  <cit> . upon tgf-β <dig> stimulation, the activated tβr <dig> associates with r-smads  and also phosphorylats them. such phosphorylation of smad-2/ <dig> induces their association with their common partner smad <dig> and subsequent translocation into the nucleus, where they control the transcription of tgf-β <dig> responsive genes  <cit> . as an inhibitory smad, smad  <dig> prevents or attenuates tgf-β signaling mainly through interaction with activated tβri and prevention of r-smad phosphorylation.

in this study, we found that the protein expression of tgf-β <dig> and tβri and the phosphorylation levels of smad  <dig> and smad  <dig> were significantly increased in the fibrotic kidney, compared with ones in the normal kidney. in cultured hk- <dig> cells, tgf-β <dig> dramatically up-regulated tβri expression and phosphorylated levels of smad  <dig> and smad  <dig>  but down-regulated smad <dig> expression, consistent with the data in vivo, and confirmed the characteristics of tgf-β/smads signaling in emt  <cit> . the down-regulation of smad <dig> protein by tgf-β <dig> is most likely due to the promotion of smad <dig> degradation  <cit> . in the rat model, sal b and vit e suppressed tgf-β <dig> and tβr-i expression and restored phosphorylation of smad <dig> and samd <dig> in fibrotic kidneys. also, in cultured hk- <dig> cells, sal b and sb- <dig> significantly down-regulated the expression of tβr-i and p-smad2/ <dig>  while restoring the diminished expression of smad <dig> secondary to tgf-β <dig> stimulation. although we did not find the action of sal b to be dose dependent, the effects of  <dig> μm of sal b are much more prominent than  <dig> μm of sal b, and almost had a similar effect as the sb- <dig> inhibitor, indicating that sal b can antagonize tβr-i function as well as its protein expression. the above results indicate that sal b can down-regulate tgf-β/smads signaling pathway, via suppressing tgf-β <dig> expression, inhibiting tβr-i expression and function, down-regulating smad 2/ <dig> phosphorylation, and preventing the down- regulation of smad <dig> by tgf-β <dig>  as stated above, mmp- <dig> has a role in renal fibrosis, especially during early pre-fibrotic stage. however, mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are not only stimulated by oxidative stress, but more importantly up-regulated by tgf-β <dig> through signal mediators such as smads and ilk  <cit> . our data also showed that mmp-2/ <dig> activities increased in hk- <dig> cells after tgf-β <dig> incubation, but were reversed by sal b and sb- <dig>  therefore, the tgf-β1/smads transduction pathway plays a key role in tubular emt and sal b's pharmacological mechanisms of action against emt and renal fibrosis.

CONCLUSIONS
sal b can prevent tubular emt in both the fibrotic kidney induced by hgcl <dig> as well as hk- <dig> cells triggered by tgf-β <dig>  the mechanism of action of sal b is closely related to the regulation of the tgf-β <dig> signaling pathway. it functions by inhibiting tgf-β <dig> expression, suppressing tβr-i expression and function, down-regulating smad 2/ <dig> phosphorylation, restoring the down- regulation of smad <dig>  and inhibiting the activity of mmp- <dig>
