BACKGROUND
reducing calf mortality is an important objective in cattle breeding populations both for animal welfare and economic reasons. bovine calf losses including late abortions, stillbirths and diseases during rearing may be in excess of 10 % . most rearing losses are attributable to infectious diarrheal and respiratory diseases  <cit> . while a number of genetic variants predisposing to high perinatal mortality have been identified in bovine populations , the mapping of loci affecting disease susceptibility and rearing success is difficult because of their low heritability  <cit> .

case-control association testing using genome-wide marker data facilitated the discovery of causal variants for monogenic disorders that result in high juvenile mortality . although the pathophysiology of such conditions is heterogeneous, pertinently affected calves may be apathetic, without vigor, retarded in growth or highly susceptible to infectious disease. affected calves may be born without typical signs of disease but develop clinical features shortly after birth  <cit> .

the availability of large-scale genotype data enables the identification of haplotypes with homozygosity depletion  <cit> . haplotypes with reduced or missing homozygosity in adult animals are likely to harbor recessive alleles that are associated with an increased pre-, peri- or postnatal mortality. genome-wide scans for homozygous haplotype deficiency in north american  <cit>  and european braunvieh  <cit>  populations uncovered a short segment on bovine chromosome  <dig> that was associated with high postnatal calf losses . the segment associated with calf mortality was denominated  <dig>  and bta19- <dig> in the north american  <cit>  and european braunvieh  <cit>  populations, respectively. since  <dig>  the associated genomic segment is consistently referred to as bh <dig> with bh being an abbreviation for braunvieh haplotype  <cit> .

in the present study, we exploit comprehensive genotyping and sequencing data to detect a missense mutation in tubd <dig> that is most likely causal for the high juvenile mortality of bh <dig> homozygous calves. we validate the missense mutation in an independent cattle population and provide evidence that homozygous calves suffer from chronic respiratory disease.

RESULTS
bh <dig> compromises juvenile survival in braunvieh cattle
we exploited array-derived genotypes of  <dig>  braunvieh animals from the national bovine genome databases to scan for homozygosity depletion on chromosome  <dig>  thirty-two haplotypes in strong linkage disequilibrium that were located between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on bta <dig> showed a significant depletion of homozygous animals . the length of the haplotypes with homozygosity depletion ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. harmful effects on fertility and calf survival were analyzed for all haplotypes with homozygosity depletion using logistic regression analyses with insemination and rearing success as response variables. none of the haplotypes tested was associated with insemination success  ruling out homozygous haplotype deficiency to result from early embryonic losses. however, all haplotypes were associated with high juvenile mortality . after combining the p values from homozygosity depletion and calf survival analyses, the most significantly associated haplotype  was located within a  <dig>  mb interval between  <dig> ,269 bp and  <dig> ,182 bp on bta <dig> . the frequency of bh <dig> was  <dig>  %. only one animal was homozygous although  <dig> were expected . the analysis of  <dig>  calving records revealed that the first-year mortality of descendants from bh <dig> risk-matings was increased by  <dig>  % compared to non-risk matings  .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the proximal region of bovine chromosome  <dig> encompassing bh <dig>  association of  <dig> haplotypes with homozygosity depletion and postnatal calf mortality . each horizontal bar represents a haplotype with homozygosity depletion. the grey shaded area highlights the most significantly associated haplotype . green, orange and blue vertical bars represent  <dig> non-coding variants, one synonymous variant in ppm1e and one missense variant in tubd <dig>  respectively. genes located within the bh <dig> interval . the grey shaded area highlights the position of bh <dig>  green and blue vertical bars represent six non-coding variants and the missense variant in the tubd <dig> gene

bh2fv
the juvenile mortality of calves from risk matings was compared to non-risk matings. matings between carrier bulls and cows descending from carrier bulls were considered as risk matings and matings between non-carrier bulls and cows descending from carrier bulls were considered as non-risk matings. the difference in survival rate refers to the proportion of additional calf losses in risk compared to non-risk matings. the physical position of the haplotypes was based on the umd <dig>  assembly of the bovine genome



two male braunvieh calves homozygous for bh <dig> were detected in the swiss bovine genome database. according to the possessing farmers, both calves were underweight at birth. one calf died for an unknown cause at 72 days of age and was not available for phenotyping. the second calf  was referred to the animal clinic at 66 days of age. during a hospitalization period of 95 days, bh2hom suffered repeatedly from bronchopneumonia. at 161 days of age, bh2hom was euthanized because of suddenly occurring severe dyspnea.

a missense mutation in tubd <dig> is compatible with recessive inheritance of bh2
to identify the causal mutation for the high mortality of bh <dig> homozygous calves, we analyzed re-sequencing data of bh2hom, five heterozygous bh <dig> carriers and  <dig> control animals of the braunvieh population. the average genome coverage in bh2hom, five heterozygous carriers and  <dig> control animals, respectively, was  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold. multi-sample variant calling in  <dig> sequenced animals yielded genotypes for  <dig>  single nucleotide and short insertion and deletion polymorphisms and  <dig>  structural variants located within the  <dig>  mb interval  with homozygosity depletion encompassing bh <dig>  these  <dig>  polymorphic sites were filtered for variants that were compatible with recessive inheritance of bh <dig> that is homozygous for the non-reference allele in bh2hom, heterozygous in bh <dig> carriers and homozygous for the reference allele in control animals. this filtering revealed  <dig> variants in ld with bh <dig> that were located between  <dig> ,803 bp and  <dig> ,557 bp on bta <dig> : fifty variants were located in non-coding regions, one variant  was a synonymous mutation in the ppm1e  gene and one variant  was a missense mutation in the tubd <dig>  gene . of the  <dig> variants in ld with bh <dig> four non-coding variants and the missense mutation in tubd <dig> were located within the  <dig>  mb interval  that showed the strongest association with homozygosity depletion and postnatal calf mortality . the four non-coding variants that were located within the bh <dig> interval were more than 50 kb away from coding sequences. moreover, two of them  were found to occur in homozygous state among  <dig> animals from various bovine breeds that had been sequenced for the  <dig> bull genomes project   <cit>  and are thus less likely to be causal for the high postnatal mortality associated with homozygosity for bh <dig>  in conclusion, the rs <dig> mutation in the tubd <dig> coding region and two non-coding variants were considered as candidate causal variants for bh <dig> . the rs <dig> c-allele causes a substitution of a histidine by an arginine at a conserved position in tubulin delta  <dig>  . the amino acid substitution is predicted to be damaging to protein function . we obtained genotypes of the rs <dig> polymorphism in  <dig> adult braunvieh animals using a kasp genotyping assay; the mutation was in high linkage disequilibrium  with bh <dig>  and none of  <dig> genotyped animals was homozygous for the c-allele . genotypes at rs <dig> differed from the haplotype-based bh <dig> states for five  animals possibly because of haplotype recombination or phasing errors. the rs <dig> polymorphism was in ld with the two non-coding variants .table  <dig> genotypes for a missense mutation in tubd <dig> in  <dig> adult braunvieh cattle

genotypes for the rs <dig> polymorphism were obtained in  <dig> braunvieh animals using kasp genotyping assays. the haplotype status  of the animals was determined using phased genotypes obtained with the illumina bovinesnp <dig> array. note that the genotyped animals are not representative for the entire braunvieh population because we preferentially selected heterozygous bh <dig> haplotype carriers for genotyping



the bh <dig> haplotype affects rearing success in another cattle breed
the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from  <dig> animals from six bovine breeds other than braunvieh revealed that rs <dig> was heterozygous in seven out of  <dig> fleckvieh animals . to obtain genotypes for rs <dig> in a representative sample of the fleckvieh population, we genotyped  <dig> randomly selected adult animals using a kasp genotyping assay. among those,  <dig> were heterozygous and none was homozygous for the c-allele corresponding to a c-allele frequency of  <dig>  %. of  <dig> animals that had been genotyped at rs <dig>   <dig>  were also genotyped with the illumina bovinehd bead chip comprising  <dig>  snps. the availability of dense marker data enabled us to detect an  <dig>  mb haplotype  that was specific for the rs <dig> c-allele: ninety-two animals that carried the c-allele were heterozygous carriers of bh2fv, whereas  <dig> animals that were homozygous for the reference allele did not carry bh2fv. in  <dig>  fleckvieh animals of the national bovine genome databases that had been genotyped with the illumina bovinesnp <dig> bead chip, the frequency of bh2fv was  <dig>  %. only four animals were homozygous for bh2fv although ten were expected . the analysis of  <dig>  calving records revealed that the first-year mortality of descendants from bh2fv risk matings was increased by  <dig>  % compared to progeny from non-risk matings  .

a common haplotype with the rs <dig> c-allele segregates in braunvieh and fleckvieh cattle
bh <dig> encompasses a  <dig>  mb segment from  <dig> ,269 bp to  <dig> ,182 bp. it is defined by eleven snps of the illumina bovinesnp <dig> bead chip. bh2fv, defined by  <dig> snps of the illumina bovinehd bead chip, is located between  <dig> ,017 bp and  <dig> ,904 bp. the bh <dig> alleles are a subset of the bh2fv alleles within a 741 kb segment between  <dig> ,269 bp and  <dig> ,269 bp . since both bh <dig> and bh2fv contain the rs <dig> c-allele, a common origin of the two haplotypes is most likely. the analysis of pedigree records enabled us to track bh <dig> and bh2fv back to the braunvieh bull rancho rustic my design  and the fleckvieh bull polzer , respectively. however, we were not able to identify common ancestors in their pedigrees possibly because of missing pedigree information from very distantly related relatives. cluster analyses using genome-wide marker data of  <dig> fleckvieh and  <dig> braunvieh animals born between  <dig> and  <dig> revealed no evidence for an exchange of genetic material between both breeds .

bh <dig> segregates in the holstein breed, but does not contain the rs <dig> c-allele
to test if the common bh2/bh2fv haplotype segment segregated in another dairy breed, we analyzed haplotypes of  <dig> adult holstein animals that had been genotyped with the illumina bovinesnp <dig> bead chip. we identified  <dig> heterozygotes and  <dig> homozygotes for bh <dig> among the genotyped holstein animals. the observed haplotype distribution did not deviate from the hardy-weinberg equilibrium . we additionally genotyped the rs <dig> polymorphism in  <dig> holstein bulls using a kasp genotyping assay. all of them including  <dig> heterozygotes and two homozygotes for bh <dig> were homozygous for the rs <dig> reference allele . another  <dig> holstein animals that had been sequenced within the  <dig> bull genomes project  <cit>  were homozygous for the reference allele indicating that the rs <dig> c-allele does not segregate in this breed. the non-reference alleles at two non-coding variants located within the bh <dig> interval were only observed at very low frequency in holstein cattle .

identification of bh <dig> homozygous calves
to unravel the pathophysiology associated with bh <dig>  we initiated a monitoring project in the austrian and swiss braunvieh populations. breeding consultants collected ear tissue samples of calves descending from bh <dig> risk matings immediately after birth for genetic investigations. of  <dig> genotyped calves, twelve were homozygous for the rs <dig> c-allele . among those, eight were stillborn or died shortly after birth. all stillborn homozygotes were underweight at  <dig> to 30 kg and appeared underdeveloped although gestation length was normal . apart from low body weight, necropsy revealed no signs of disease. four live born homozygous calves  were referred to the animal clinic.table  <dig> sampling of calves from bh <dig> risk matings

during the sampling of bh <dig> homozygous calves, we encountered a male fleckvieh calf  with low birth weight and postnatal growth restriction that descended from a bh2fv carrier bull. at 40 days of age, its weight was  <dig>  kg, which is only a third compared to healthy fleckvieh calves of the same age. fv <dig> was tested negatively for two recessive mutations that are known to cause retarded growth  <cit> . another 16-months old braunvieh bull  with poor growth performance and a history of recurrent respiratory disease was reported by a farmer. inspection of the bull’s pedigree revealed bh <dig> carriers among its paternal and maternal ancestors. sanger sequencing of dna samples from fv <dig> and bv <dig> confirmed that both animals were homozygous for the rs <dig> c-allele. both animals were referred to the animal clinic.

homozygous animals suffer from chronic airway disease
at admission, six homozygous animals were emaciated and their heads appeared elongated . initial examinations revealed aberrant breathing sounds , tachypnea, tachycardia and excessive mucous exudation from the nostrils . the analysis of blood parameters revealed iron deficiency and increased monocyte counts in some animals possibly indicating ongoing response to infectious disease . the clinical features led to the diagnosis of bronchopneumonia and the animals were treated accordingly. although the medication alleviated the clinical symptoms, respiratory disease recurred repeatedly. due to the steadily declining health condition with no prospect for improvement, all animals were euthanized and subjected to necropsy.fig.  <dig> phenotypic manifestation of homozygosity for bh <dig> in four animals. pictures of bv <dig> , fv <dig> , bv <dig>  and bv <dig>  were taken at the time of admission in the animal clinic  and shortly before euthanasia , respectively. a detailed description of the disease manifestations is available in table 4


parameters from the initial examination of six braunvieh  and fleckvieh  animals homozygous for the rs <dig> c-allele



at necropsy, the animals were underweight and emaciated. macroscopic abnormalities of the respiratory tract such as mucopurulent rhinitis, tracheobronchitis and lung lesions became evident in all animals . histological sections of tissue samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract revealed hyperplastic ciliated epithelia with intraepithelial neutrophils and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue  hyperplasia, respectively, accompanied by bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis . the lumen of bronchi and bronchioles were obstructed by mucopurulent exudate and the surrounding lung tissue was atelectatic and showed minimal intra-alveolar infiltration of inflammatory cells. transmission electron microscopic  data of ciliated epithelial tissue were available from the upper and lower respiratory tract of four animals . analyses of tem sections revealed defective microtubule organization in 20-30 % of ciliary cross-sections including transposition faults, microtubular disorganization, absence of outer and central microtubule pair and aberrations of the outer and inner dynein arms .fig.  <dig> transmission electron microscopy of respiratory cilia of bh <dig> homozygous animals. motile cilia are characterized by a typical “9x2 + 2” architecture, i.e., nine outer microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of microtubule. the tem sections of respiratory cilia of bronchi from bv <dig>  and fv <dig>  revealed multiple ultrastructural defects including transposition defects of microtubuli and microtubular disorganization , absence of a central microtubule pair , and loss of inner and/or outer dynein arms . magnification of cilia with typical ultrastructural defects found in the respiratory tract of bv <dig>  and bv <dig> 



homozygosity for bh <dig> may be incompletely penetrant
breeding consultants reported another three braunvieh animals that were homozygous for bh <dig>  these homozygous animals were detected during routine genomic evaluation using genotypes of the illumina bovinesnp <dig> bead chip. sanger sequencing of dna samples confirmed homozygosity for the rs <dig> c-allele in all animals. while one young bull  was healthy and normally developed at the age of 370 days, two animals  were retarded in growth and had a history of recurrent respiratory disease . the three homozygous animals were also homozygous for the alternate allele at two non-coding variants in ld with rs <dig> .

discussion
we show that the proximal region of bovine chromosome  <dig> is associated with high peri- and postnatal calf losses in braunvieh cattle, corroborating previous reports of a harmful haplotype  in european and north-american braunvieh populations  <cit> . the joint analysis of homozygosity depletion and insemination and rearing data revealed a  <dig>  mb segment between  <dig> ,269 bp and  <dig> ,182 bp on bta <dig> as the most likely interval harboring the causal mutation, which agrees with previous findings  <cit> . the first-year mortality of calves descending from bh <dig> risk matings is less than expected for a lethal recessive disorder, indicating that some bh <dig> homozygous calves may reach adulthood. despite its detrimental effect on juvenile survival, the frequency of bh <dig> is high in the european braunvieh populations . based on the retrospective analysis of inadvertent bh <dig> riskmatings that happened in the austrian braunvieh population  between  <dig> and  <dig>  we estimated that between  <dig> and  <dig> bh <dig> homozygous animals were born annually in the past 25 years. deleterious alleles may reach high frequency in cattle populations because of the widespread use of unnoticed carrier bulls in artificial insemination and pleiotropic effects on desirable traits . so far, there is no evidence that bh <dig> has desirable effects on important breeding objectives. several harmful conditions other than bh <dig> segregate in the braunvieh populations . pinpointing the causal mutation allows for the implementation of efficient genome-based mating programs to avoid the inadvertent mating of carrier animals while maintaining genetic diversity and high rates of genetic gain. a missense mutation  in tubd <dig> was found to be compatible with recessive inheritance of bh <dig>  affected, carrier and non-carrier animals were homozygous for the alternate allele, heterozygous and homozygous, respectively, for the reference allele at rs <dig>  although bh <dig> is in high ld with rs <dig>  the identification of carrier animals is less reliable with haplotype information. five out of  <dig> animals were misclassified based on the haplotype test indicating both lower specificity and sensitivity of haplotype-based classification of animals into carriers and non-carriers which agrees with previous findings in cattle  <cit> .

pinpointing causal mutations is often difficult as many sequence variants may be compatible with the presumed pattern of inheritance . in  <dig> sequenced braunvieh animals of our study, two intergenic variants were in complete ld with rs <dig>  yet we consider rs <dig> as the most likely to be causal because it results in a substitution of a conserved amino acid residue. moreover, all compatible non-coding variants are far away from annotated transcripts and are thus less likely to be functionally important. however, it cannot be ruled out a priori that such variants affect gene regulation, e.g., if located in a distant enhancer region. a criterion for causality is often that the segregation of the candidate variant is restricted to the population affected by the condition . strictly applying this criterion to our data would have led to the exclusion of rs <dig> as a plausible causal mutation for bh <dig>  because it segregates in fleckvieh cattle where a previous scan for homozygous haplotype deficiency did not detect homozygosity depletion at the bh <dig> region  <cit> . in the present study, we specifically tested the bh2fv haplotype with the rs <dig> c-allele for association with juvenile mortality in more than  <dig>  fleckvieh animals. homozygosity depletion at bh2fv was not significant  possibly because most fleckvieh animals of the present study were genotyped shortly after birth, before typical signs of disease may become manifest. however, the first-year mortality of descendants is significantly higher in bh2fv risk than non-risk matings  corroborating a detrimental effect of bh2fv.

the exchange of genetic material between breeds may result in the manifestation of the same recessively inherited conditions in different populations  <cit> . kumar kadri et al. identified a sequence variant that compromises fertility in three admixed nordic dairy breeds  <cit> . drögemüller et al. mapped a sequence variant for an autosomal recessive skin disease in two geographically separated albeit genetically related dog populations  <cit> . a diagnostic haplotype associated with progressive degenerative myeloencephalopathy  in braunvieh cattle also segregates in the holstein cattle breed  <cit> . however, the most likely causal variant for weaver syndrome was never found in haplotype carriers from the holstein cattle breed indicating that an ancestral version of the haplotype without the weaver mutation persists in holstein cattle  <cit> . the discovery of a recessive mutation that compromises juvenile survival in fleckvieh and braunvieh cattle demonstrates for the first time, that deleterious alleles may segregate across closed cattle populations, e.g., populations without recent admixture. fleckvieh and braunvieh animals with the rs <dig> c-allele share a common haplotype, indicating they inherited the corresponding chromosome segment from a common ancestor. however, our data neither revealed common ancestors nor provided evidence of an exchange of genetic material between both breeds. a version of the ancestral haplotype without the rs <dig> c-allele also segregates in holstein cattle at relatively high frequency . these findings indicate that the rs <dig> mutation occurred in an ancient ancestor of braunvieh and fleckvieh cattle, however, after the divergence from holstein cattle, which is compatible with the history of those breeds  <cit> . while bh <dig> and bh2fv affect juvenile survival in braunvieh and fleckvieh cattle, respectively, the haplotype version without the rs <dig> c-allele does not exhibit homozygous haplotype deficiency in holstein cattle supporting causality of the rs <dig> polymorphism.

to investigate the pathophysiology that may result from the rs <dig> mutation in tubd <dig>  we examined six homozygous animals. although the age of the examined animals differed, the disease manifestation was homogeneous: recurrent airway disease resulted in a steadily declining general condition and poor growth performance despite excellent husbandry conditions and medical treatment at the animal clinic. thus, a more severe disease progression in homozygous animals kept under normal husbandry conditions in conventional farms is likely. the respiratory manifestations resemble disease patterns arising from defective cilia of the respiratory tract . we observed microtubular assembly defects in 20-30 % of the cilia of the respiratory epithelium in affected animals which is 4- <dig> times higher than in healthy individuals . ultrastructural defects of the cilia might also result from infectious or inflammatory diseases  <cit> . persistent coughing, tachypnea and airway mucus obstruction in homozygous animals might indicate an impaired mucociliary clearance due to an aberrant ciliary beat pattern . we used a cytology brush to collect viable epithelial cells from the nasal mucosa of affected calves to investigate ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency . however, all collected samples were excessively covered with mucous exudate and contained numerous inflammatory cells, precluding the analysis of ciliary beating using standard protocols.

several sequence variants associated with ultrastructural aberrations of respiratory cilia cause chronic airway disease in humans, mice and dogs . respiratory cilia are characterized by a “9x2 + 2” architecture consisting of a central pair of microtubule surrounded by nine outer microtubule doublets. the basal body is located at the base of the cilium where it attaches to the cell body. tubulin delta  <dig> is required for proper microtubule polymerization in basal bodies . a lack of tubd <dig> causes ultrastructural microtubular defects in basal bodies in chlamydomonas and paramecium  <cit> . we also observed disorganized microtubules in airway cilia of animals homozygous for the rs <dig> mutation corroborating a crucial role of tubd <dig> for proper assembly of cilia. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a phenotypic effect associated with genomic variation in tubd <dig> in a mammalian species. a conserved histidine residue at amino acid position  <dig> in tubd <dig> is involved in microtubule polymerization  <cit> . since the rs <dig> c-allele introduces a putatively damaging substitution of the histidine by an arginine, proper microtubule polymerization might be compromised in homozygous animals, resulting in ultrastructural defects of the airway cilia. besides being involved in cilia assembly, microtubules constitute the bipolar spindle that binds and moves the chromosomes during the different meiotic phases. disturbed microtubule formation may lead to erroneous segregation of chromosomes with negative effects on growth and differentiation . such disturbances could be responsible for frequently observed prenatal growth retardation and stillbirth of fetuses from bh <dig> risk matings.

most homozygous calves  were stillborn or died shortly after birth. six hospitalized calves suffered from airway disease early in life. the general condition of all hospitalized animals declined steadily because the disease was not responsive to medical treatment. however, homozygosity for the rs <dig> mutation does not necessarily have fatal consequences as evidenced by a bull homozygous for the putative disease allele without any apparent signs of disease. although minimizing exposure to environmental pollutants and respiratory pathogens may contribute to a less severe disease progression  <cit> , our results suggest that the mutation is highly penetrant because  <dig> out of  <dig> homozygous animals were stillborn or diseased shortly after birth. in any case, our findings now enable to implement genome-based mating strategies to avoid the mating of carrier animals thereby preventing the birth of homozygous calves that are likely to suffer from chronic disease.

CONCLUSIONS
a missense mutation in tubd <dig> is associated with high juvenile mortality in braunvieh and, unexpectedly, fleckvieh cattle. since genomic analyses revealed no evidence for an exchange of genetic material between both breeds, we demonstrate for the first time that the same harmful recessive mutation may segregate in different closed populations, indicating that such mutations may have occurred many generations ago. homozygous animals suffer from chronic airway disease possibly resulting from defective cilia in the respiratory tract. our findings now enable the implementation of genome-based mating strategies in order to prevent animal suffering and economic losses.
