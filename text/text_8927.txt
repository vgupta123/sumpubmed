BACKGROUND
the early embryo is transcriptionally inactive and all rnas present that are needed for embryonic development have been maternally deposited during oogenesis. the onset of zygotic transcription marks the beginning of the maternal-zygotic transition  whereby maternal rnas are progressively degraded and zygotic transcription takes over, providing the necessary gene products for development  <cit> . recent large-scale studies have tried to determine what genes or groups of genes are expressed during drosophila development  <cit> . at least some of the early zygotic genes such as bottleneck  <cit>  are fast-evolving or subject to turnover in dipteran insects because a homolog of the drosophila bottleneck is not found in any of the sequenced mosquito genomes. to study the evolution of early zygotic genes through comparative analysis, we set out to identify early zygotic genes in the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti by transcriptome profiling, taking advantage of large-scale illumina sequencing. we have determined the mzt starting in ae. aegypti within 2- <dig> hr after egg deposition, based on illumina transcriptome profiling and rt-pcr. this time is just before or at the beginning of pole cell formation at  <dig> hr  <cit> . early zygotic transcription at this time is developmentally consistent with reports from drosophila that indicate transcription starting as early as cycle  <dig>  <cit> , also just before the onset of pole cell formation. we focused on the purely zygotic genes that do not have a maternal contribution. thus, we were searching for transcripts that were not present in the embryos 0- <dig> hr after egg deposition but started to appear 2- <dig> hr after egg deposition.

one of the early and pure zygotic genes identified was a kinesin light chain  gene that is the focus of this study. the three classes of cytoskeleton molecular motors include kinesin, dynein, and myosin, with kinesin and dynein using microtubules as a track for transport and myosin depending on actin filaments  <cit> . kinesins are a diverse family of proteins as demonstrated by phylogenies based on the heavy chain  <cit>  and are involved in a variety of cellular transport roles  <cit> . the conventional kinesin  is a heterotetramer having two kinesin heavy chains characterized by atpase-dependent motor activity and two kinesin light chains . klcs are accessory proteins that have a c-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat  domain comprising approximately  <dig> residues that binds cargo for transport  <cit> . here we report the discovery of two novel embryonic-specific klc genes we call aaklc <dig> in aedes aegypti  and their likely ortholog in c. quinquefasciatus. we analyze these genes in comparison to other klc genes in diverse organisms and suggest gene duplication as a source for the purely zygotic aaklc <dig> genes, which are fast-evolving.

another goal of this research was related to efforts to develop a gene drive system for mosquitoes, which may be used to spread pathogen-resistant genes into mosquito populations to control mosquito-borne infectious disease. a natural gene drive system comprised of maternal effect dominant embryonic arrest  factors was first discovered in the flour beetle t. castaneum  <cit> . in this system, medea is comprised of a maternally expressed toxin that is passed on to all embryos of a medea-bearing female, and a tightly linked zygotically expressed antidote that is only made in medea-bearing embryos. as a result, only medea-bearing offspring of a medea-bearing female will survive, which leads to the fixation of the medea allele in the population. chen et al.  <dig> successfully engineered and demonstrated a medea system in d. melanogaster that employs the use of maternal-specific and zygotic-specific promoters to drive expression of toxin and antidote genes, respectively  <cit> . developing a medea system in mosquitoes requires the identification of early zygotic genes in the mosquito species of interest due to the difficulty of finding orthologs to d. melanogaster zygotic genes as mentioned above. we identified the zygotic-specific aaklc <dig>  and demonstrated strong promoter activity of its upstream sequence in ae. aegypti early embryos.

RESULTS
identification of two early zygotic kinesin light chain genes aaklc <dig>  and aaklc <dig> 
we looked at expression from ae. aegypti liverpool strain embryos at  <dig> time ranges of 0- <dig>  2- <dig>  4- <dig>  and 8- <dig> hr. over  <dig>  ae. aegypti annotated transcripts  were used in blast  <cit>  vs. sequences obtained from illumina. of particular interest for the discovery of pure early zygotic genes were the transcripts having no hits in the 0- <dig> hr , and hits present at 2- <dig> hr. several transcripts were identified with these criteria, including two klc genes aaklc <dig>   and its paralog aaklc <dig>  . the nomenclature here does not correspond to mammalian klc nomenclature because the focus is on insect klc genes. aaklc <dig>  and aaklc <dig>  are 98% identical to each other in their coding regions and it was possible to design gene-specific primers to independently confirm their expression profiles by rt-pcr as described later. shown in table  <dig> is the illumina result of three klc genes in this study, one of which is not purely zygotic, but ubiquitously expressed .

notes: 0- <dig>  2- <dig>  4- <dig>  and 8- <dig> hr indicate time ranges from which rna was isolated from developing ae. aegypti embryos. raw values of the three transcripts in the four samples  are given at left. normalized values  are calculated as the raw values divided by the transcript  length, then divided by the total number of reads matching all annotated mrna transcripts from each sample, and multiplied by 1e <dig>  the total number of reads matching all annotated mrna transcripts from each sample time point was: 0- <dig> hr ; 2- <dig> hr ; 4- <dig> hr ; 8- <dig> hr . see additional file  <dig> for a summary of the illumina data. a fasta file of all illumina sequence hits that match the three kinesin light chain transcripts in all four samples is provided as additional file  <dig> 

structural and genomic analysis of aaklc <dig> and other klc genes
structural analysis supports the categorization of two klc gene groups, the aaklc1-like and the aaklc2-like genes . aaklc <dig>  is an intronless gene with a predicted open reading frame  of  <dig> nucleotides . aaklc <dig>  is also intronless and has 98% nt and aa identity to aaklc <dig>  in its coding region. the lack of introns in the aaklc2-like genes is notable since it has been reported that 70% of drosophila early zygotic genes do not have introns presumably for increased efficiency of transcription with fast-cycling nuclei  <cit> . a likely ortholog of the aaklc <dig> genes was identified in c. quinquefasciatus, which is an intronless gene having a similar orf length . however, no similar genes were found in the genome sequences of an. gambiae  <cit> , an. stephensi , d. melanogaster, or other insects. thus from genome analysis, it appears that aaklc2-like genes are restricted to mosquitoes of the subfamily culicinae. the expression of the c. quinquefasciatus gene will need to be verified by rt-pcr or other methods to determine if it is indeed an early and transient zygotic gene. this is why we have not called it cqklc <dig> 

unlike the aaklc2-like genes, aaklc1-like genes have longer orfs and at least one intron . interestingly, these aaklc1-like genes have conservation of intron position in some cases. for example,  <dig> introns have conserved positions between ae. aegypti and an. gambiae, and one intron position is conserved in ae. aegypti, an. gambiae, and d. melanogaster. in addition, one intron position and length is conserved between ae. aegypti and d. melanogaster.

all of the klc genes have tetratricopeptide repeat  and rab5-binding domains as determined by the conserved domain database  v <dig>  at the national center for biotechnology information  website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ . rab <dig> is a small gtpase that regulates early endosome fusion  <cit> . the rab- <dig> binding and tpr domains detected in the  <dig> aa sequence of aaklc <dig>  have e-values of 1e- <dig> and 3e- <dig>  respectively. it is interesting to note that there is a partial gene duplication  of aaklc <dig> that contains only the rab <dig> binding domain and has 100% nt identity to aaklc <dig> throughout  <dig> of the  <dig> bases of the aael <dig> orf . the  <dig> aa conceptual translation of aael <dig> only has  <dig> aa different than aaklc <dig> 

phylogenetic inference of klc genes demonstrates a diverse evolutionary history
published kinesin phylogenies have focused on the kinesin heavy chain. here we present a klc phylogeny including representatives from mosquito, fly, wasp, honeybee, worm, fish, frog, sea urchin, squid, monkey, cow, chicken, mouse, rat, human, and bacteria . like kinesin heavy chain phylogeny, klc phylogeny is also rather diverse having many paralogous groups, with most of the diversity existing in mammals. for example, humans have  <dig> paralogous klc genes. in contrast, the holometabolous insects surveyed have  <dig> klc gene in common that includes aaklc <dig> in ae. aegypti. the aaklc <dig> genes that are zygotic-specific  and their likely ortholog in c. quinquefasciatus appear to be restricted to species of culicinae because similar sequences could not be detected in the genome sequences of the mosquito an. gambiae or other insects. interestingly, the aaklc <dig> genes and the c. quinquefasciatus aaklc2-like gene are fast-evolving genes relative to the highly conserved aaklc1-like genes. shown are the only klc genes detected in insects resulting from blast searches using divergent klc genes from the phylogeny as queries.

the phylogeny indicates that the aaklc2-like genes arose prior to the divergence of ae. aegypti and an. gambiae lineages, suggesting an event that predates the divergence of culicinae and anophelinae. this is perplexing because aaklc2-like genes are not detected in anopheline mosquitoes an. gambiae and an. stephensi, which suggests that aaklc2-like genes arose within culicinae after culicinae/anophelinae divergence and prior to the divergence of aedes and culex genera. also curious is that ae. aegypti aael <dig> and c. quinquefasciatus cpij <dig> klc aa sequences do not obtain each other as reciprocal best hits by blastp. however, the structural and phylogenetic inference supports their grouping . genomic survey of more species will be needed to elucidate this matter.

expression analysis indicates that aaklc <dig> genes are transiently expressed in the early zygotic stage while aaklc <dig> is ubiquitously expressed
the first indication of aaklc <dig>  and aaklc <dig>  as early and transiently expressed zygotic genes came from embryonic transcriptome profiling . transcripts were absent in the 0- <dig> hr sample and had no hits in the 8- <dig> hr sample , but hits were present in both 2- <dig> and 4- <dig> hr samples. this profile was validated by rt-pcr using  <dig> hr time intervals from 0- <dig> hr embryos . furthermore, rt-pcr with rna from other tissues and life stages shows that their expression is restricted to the early embryo. transcription begins as early as 2- <dig> hr and only a faint band can be detected at 6- <dig> hr, with the large majority of intensity found during the 3- <dig> hr time range. aaklc <dig>  has an almost identical expression profile to aaklc <dig>  according to rt-pcr . rt-pcr products were cloned, sequenced, and verified to be specific for each transcript. these data support that aaklc <dig> genes are early zygotic transiently expressed genes whose expression is restricted to the early embryonic life stage. in contrast, aaklc <dig> is expressed in all developmental stages and tissues surveyed by rt-pcr. it also has significant presence in the 0- <dig> and 8- <dig> hr illumina sample .

expression data from ests and microarray experiments for klc genes is consistent with the hypothesis that aaklc2-like genes  are zygotic-specific genes and aaklc1-like genes  are ubiquitously expressed genes . using blast by ncbi, est hits for various life stages are detected for the aaklc1-like genes in table  <dig>  and for the other holometabolous insects in figure  <dig> . however, no est hits for aaklc2-like genes are detected. this is most likely simply explained by the lack of est data from embryos. microarray experiments covering developmental time periods for an. gambiae reveal expression for the aaklc1-like but not for aaklc2-like genes. these data further support the existence of two distinct types of klc genes.

early zygotic promoter activity of aaklc <dig>  upstream sequence in ae. aegypti embryos
the  <dig> kb upstream sequence relative to the predicted start codon of aaklc <dig>  was synthesized  to test for promoter activity. this sequence was cloned into the pgl3-basic luciferase reporter vector, injected into ae. aegypti embryos, and assayed for luciferase activity. aaklc <dig>  upstream sequence clearly demonstrates promoter activity, as the mean fold activity of aaklc <dig> _pgl3-basic is 1604x greater than the empty vector alone . the  <dig> kb upstream sequence for aaklc <dig>  was also tested and it demonstrated similar activity . several independent experiments have demonstrated the activity of these sequences and we are now working towards defining the minimal promoter sequence. the transcription profile of aaklc <dig>  is solely zygotic  and the reporter assay clearly indicates early zygotic activity of the aaklc <dig>  promoter. however, the transient assay described here does not directly test whether the promoter is solely zygotic. transgenic lines of ae. aegypti are needed to directly answer such a question.

discussion
a novel set of purely zygotic genes: duplications, fast evolution, and possible function
aaklc2-like genes are only found in culicinae mosquitoes ae. aegypti and c. quinquefasciatus. however the aaklc1-like genes are found in all surveyed holometabolous insects and are quite conserved in their structure and expression profiles. thus it is likely that aaklc <dig> genes are the paralogs that took on a new expression profile and possibly a new function in culicinae. it is also interesting that in addition to the duplication that gave rise to the aaklc <dig> gene lineage, there has been another duplication resulting in aaklc <dig>  and aaklc <dig> .

the aaklc2-like genes appear to be fast-evolving genes according to their branch length . for example, aaklc <dig>  and the c. quinquefasciatus aaklc2-like gene  have 44% aa identity, while aaklc <dig> and the c. quinquefasciatus aaklc1-like gene  have 94% aa identity. a curious question is whether aaklc2-like genes have been under positive selection. however, we were unable to perform nonsynonymous/synonymous  analysis due to the divergence of the aaklc <dig> and the c. quinquefasciatus cpij <dig> 

the presence of at least one highly conserved klc gene  in all of insects is not surprising given its indispensable role in intracellular transport, but it is interesting why a novel zygotic-specific klc arose in culicinae. the genome sizes of ae. aegypti and c. quinquefasciatus are approximately three and two times larger than an. gambiae  <cit>  possibly providing more evolutionary freedom for gene expansion early in culicinae. a large proportion of drosophila early and transient zygotic genes were found to be involved in neurogenesis and dorso-ventral patterning  <cit> . also noteworthy is that a klc gene has been implicated in translocation of dorsal determinants in xenopus  <cit> . although we do not have experimental evidence of aaklc <dig> function in the embryo, it seems plausible that these genes may play a similar role in early embryonic development, given their early and transient zygotic-specific expression profile. specialization of klc genes is a recurrent event in evolution. in rat and mouse it was found that klc <dig> is restricted to spermatid tails while klc <dig> and klc <dig> are only found in testis before meiosis  <cit> . a rat klc isoform was found to associate with mitochondria in cultured cells  <cit> . in mouse it was also found that two klcs were present in the central and peripheral nervous system, but one is enriched in sciatic nerve exons and the other is enriched in the olfactory bulb glomeruli  <cit> . these examples of klc specialization are from mammals and are consistent with the klc diversity in mammals demonstrated in figure  <dig>  therefore, the fact that we can only find one conserved klc gene in holometabolous insects  underscores the generation of aaklc <dig> genes as an interesting evolutionary event, demonstrating the potential for klc specialization in this taxonomic group.

potential applications of an early zygotic promoter in the context of the medea gene drive system
we demonstrated that the promoter region of the two aaklc <dig> genes can direct early zygotic transcription in the ae. aegypti embryo. thus this promoter may be useful to direct the expression of the antidote gene as part of the medea gene drive system  <cit> . the aaklc <dig> genes are expressed specifically, transiently, and early in the embryonic stage, which makes them good candidates to drive the antidote expression. the antidote needs to be delivered at the appropriate time for embryonic rescue, providing the replacement of mrna that was targeted by the maternal toxin. in addition, lack of antidote expression in the ovary will eliminate antagonist effects to the toxin. lastly, purely zygotic expression will eliminate concerns of ectopic expression that could reduce fitness and thus reduce gene drive efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
we have discovered a novel set of klc genes in ae. aegypti that we call aaklc <dig>  and aaklc <dig> , and have demonstrated that they are purely zygotic. these are the first reported in any mosquito species and they have a newly evolved expression pattern relative to the aaklc <dig> genes. we have also identified a likely aaklc <dig> gene ortholog in c. quinquefasciatus. its similar structure and lack of representation in ests suggests that it is also a zygotic gene. aaklc2-like genes appear to be restricted to culicinae, as they are not detected in an. gambiae or an. stephensi, or other genome sequences. genomic survey of more species and additional expression analyses will be needed to test these hypotheses. data from ests and hybridization experiments in addition to our transcriptome and expression analysis by rt-pcr support the existence of two distinct klc gene groups, the zygotic aaklc2-like genes, and the highly conserved aaklc1-like genes that are found in all mosquitoes and insects surveyed. we also demonstrated strong promoter activity of the aaklc <dig> gene upstream sequence in ae. aegypti early embryos. large-scale transcriptome profiling has proven to be a valuable method for the identification of early and transient zygotic-specific genes. these technologies have allowed us to rapidly achieve results for a specific objective. moreover, as we are currently acquiring and analyzing more transcriptome data, we will be able to investigate the complex and dynamic expression of genes in the early embryo and conduct comparative evolutionary studies with other mosquito species and drosophila.
