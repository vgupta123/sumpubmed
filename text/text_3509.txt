BACKGROUND
ubiquitination  is an enzymatic and post-translational modification process, in which ubiquitin  is attached to a substrate protein . in the process of ubiquitination, ubiquitin is bound to lysine  residues on the protein substrate via the three steps of activation, conjugation and ligation performed by ubiquitin activating enzymes , ubiquitin conjugating enzymes , and ubiquitin ligases , respectively . note that the binding can be either a single ubiquitin or chains of ubiquitin. many regulatory functions of ubiquitination have been found, such as proteasomal degradation, dna repair and transcription, signal transduction, and endocytosis and sorting, which are all important protein regulation functions in the biological processes .

due to ubiquitination’s important regulation roles, research has been widely conducted to further decipher the mechanism of the ubiquitination process and its other regulatory roles at the molecular level. one of the initial and challenging steps towards gaining more understanding of ubiquitination is identification of ubiquitination sites. different types of experimental methods have been employed to purify ubiquitination proteins in order to determine ubiquitination sites, such as high-throughput mass spectrometry  techniques , ubiquitin antibodies and ubiquitin binding proteins  <cit> , and combinations of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry  <cit> . however, the experiments that purify ubiquitination proteins are very time-consuming, expensive and labor-intensive, because the ubiquitination process is dynamic, rapid and reversible  <cit> . to reduce experiment cost and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of ubiquitination site identification, computational  methods have been introduced and developed based on informatics techniques for the prediction of ubiquitination sites based on prior knowledge of protein sequences  <cit> .

machine learning methods have been applied to the protein ubiquitination site prediction problem. various ubiquitination prediction methods, algorithms and tools have been developed that address different features of the protein sequences . for example, tung and ho developed a tool called ubipred, which uses the informative physicochemical property  mining algorithm to select informative pcp features, and then employs a support vector machine  for ubiquitination site prediction  and k-nearest neighbor classifiers)  <cit> . radivojac et al developed a random forest predictor for ubiquitination sites, named ubpred, which uses different sequence attributes including amino acid  compositions and pcp  <cit> . a sequence-based predictor of ubiquitination site was developed based on a nearest neighbor algorithm using the features of pssm  conservation scores , aa factors, and disorder scores   <cit> . chen et al developed an ubiquitination prediction tool called cksaap_ubsite based on the svm technique and with composition of k-spaced aa pairs as the features  <cit> . they also developed a human-specific ubiquitination prediction tools, named hcksaap_ubsite, which integrates cksaap_ubsite with two other svm classifiers  using logistic regression   <cit> . chen et al presented a tool known as ubiprober for large scale predictions of ubiquitination based on svm technique using three features of k nearest neighbor, aa composition, and pcp  <cit> . walsh et al designed a sequence-based ubiquitination predictor called rapid ubiquitination  for rapid application on a genome scale using an iterative approach  <cit> . these studies and tools use different features/properties of the protein sequences as the data to learn and predict the ubiquitination sites, in which the protein sequences are obtained from different sources including research papers and experiments. note that, among different types of features used for ubiquitination site prediction, pcp is one of the most important and widely used feature types, which influence the posttranslational modification process  and define the protein structures and functions together with biochemical properties  <cit> . thus, we will use the same information  of protein sequences as the features for ubiquitination site prediction in this paper.

as mentioned above, different kinds of machine learning methods have been employed for the ubiquitination prediction model development, owing to their powerful model learning and prediction abilities. for example, bayesian networks are a powerful probability-based method for model learning, which have been widely used in biomedical problems . the svm is a supervised learning model that finds the maximum margin hyper-plane separating the classes  <cit> , and which has been used in many domains including biomedical informatics . logistic regression  is another widely used regression analysis method based on the logistic function  <cit> , which has also been popularly employed for prediction and classification in biomedical problems  <cit> . least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  is a shrinkage linear method for regression widely used in prediction and classification, which is simple and can often describe the relation between the inputs and the output adequately and interpretably .

this paper aims at exploring different machine learning methods for ubiquitination site prediction using the same type of information of protein sequences, i.e., pcp features. six segment-pcp data sets are first established based on the aaindex database  <cit>  and protein sequence data from the literature. two categories  machine learning methods are then applied to analyzing the six segment-pcp data sets for ubiquitination site prediction. bayesian-based methods include naïve bayes   <cit> , feature selection nb   <cit> , model averaged nb   <cit> , and efficient bayesian multivariate classifier   <cit> , while regression-based methods are svm  <cit> , lr  <cit> , and lasso . we compared the performance of different prediction models for ubiquitination sites in terms of the values of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve . experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning methods for mining information from protein sequence pcp data for ubiquitination prediction, as well as the superior performance of ebmc, svm and lr  as compared with other methods.

the remainder of this paper is organized in four sections. section “methods” presents the data establishing methods of the six segment-pcp data sets and the seven machine learning methods used for ubiquitination site prediction. in section “results”, experimental results are described and analyzed. a discussion appears in section “discussion”, and section “conclusions” concludes the paper with final remarks.

methods
methods for establishing and processing the segment-pcp data are presented, and the machine learning methods  for the ubiquitination site prediction based on the established segment-pcp data sets are then introduced.

data sets
as we know, a protein is a biological molecule that consists of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. a protein sequence is commonly built by  <dig> different amino acids  with 1-letter abbreviations as arndcqeghilkmfpstwyv  <cit> . among these aas, lysine  is the essential amino acid that binds the ubiquitin and affects the protein function via ubiquitination . to identify whether a lysine  is an ubiquitination site, we would need to gain information of the amino acids around the lysine  residue. to gather such information for the ubiquitination prediction, protein sequence segments are thus extracted from the long chain of aa residues for the ubiquitination prediction, while pcps for each segment are calculated based on pcps of each aa on the segment. the data establishing process includes the following three steps: sequence segment extraction, aa-pcp matrix generation, and segment-pcp prediction matrix generation. details are shown in the diagram of fig.  <dig>  and are described next.fig.  <dig> diagram of the process for segment-pcp prediction matrix generation



first, six data sets of protein sequences are collected from the literature, with the number of segments and data sources shown in table  <dig>  the detailed extraction process of each data set is described as below.table  <dig> sequence segment data set list for ubiquitination site prediction

in data set  <dig> , a 300-sequence set is collected from  <cit> , in which  <dig> sequence segments include ubiquitination lysine k sites in the center of the 13-aa segments  and  <dig> segments have non-ubiquitination central k sites .

data set  <dig>  with  <dig> 27-aa segments is from the independent data set in  <cit> , which has half-half ubiquitination and non-ubiquitination k sites in the center of the protein sequence segments.

in data set  <dig> ,  <dig> 27-aa protein sequence segments are obtained from the training data set in  <cit> , with 50 % of the segments having ubiquitination central k sites and 50 % having non-ubiquitination central k sites.

in data set  <dig> , we have  <dig> 27-aa protein sequence segments , which are extracted from all the k sites in  <dig> proteins  containing experimentally validated ubiquitination sites used in  <cit> .

in data set  <dig> , we extracted all k sites from  <dig> protein sequences  collected from experiments and literature by the authors in  <cit> , which results in  <dig> 27-aa segments with  <dig> ubiquitination positive segments and  <dig> non-ubiquitination negative ones.

in data set  <dig>  is a set of  <dig> 27-aa protein sequence segments , which is extracted from  <dig> protein sequences  containing reportedly verified ubiquitination sites that were used as an independent testing data in  <cit> .



each row of the six protein sequence segment matrices  contains the segment sequence, the protein , the position of the central k in the original protein sequence, and the ubiquitination class . note that, in the process of segment extraction, if the k site is near the beginning or the end of a protein sequence, appropriate number of “-“ symbols are appended to the beginning or the end of the segment in order to form each segment with the same length. in addition, every protein sequence segment in the six data sets contains k sites in the center of the segment, which could be either ubiquitination or non-ubiquitination sites. the six extracted protein sequence segment matrix data sets are included in the additional file  <dig> 

second, due to the importance of pcp of amino acid in protein sequence function, pcps of each aa on the sequence segment are collected from aaindex  <cit>  for the ubiquitination site prediction. the pcp data in aaindex <dig> format is processed to create an aa-pcp matrix with each column being the pcp value of each of the  <dig> aas and each row being a pcp feature. in such an aa-pcp data set, a row title is the aaindex entry accession number of the pcp, and a column title is 1-letter abbreviation of the  <dig> aas. since  <dig> pcp features with missing values are deleted, there are  <dig> pcp features  in the aa-pcp matrix used in this paper. an example of the aa-pcp matrix is shown in the second block on the right in fig.  <dig>  note that biological descriptions and related studies of each pcp can be found though aaindex database  <cit> .

finally, based on the six protein sequence segment data sets and the aa-pcp matrix, we established six segment-pcp matrices for the ubiquitination site prediction. in such matrices, each row is a protein sequence segment and each column is a pcp feature, as shown in the bottom block of fig.  <dig>  the pcp values are calculated based on averaging. that is, to get the value of a particular pcp feature for a particular segment, all aa values for this pcp for all the aas on the segment are averaged. there are totally  <dig> pcp features/columns in each segment-pcp data set, while the numbers of the segments/rows of each of the six data sets are the same as the ones shown in second column of table  <dig>  the ubiquitination class is added as the last column in the data sets. sequence segments and pcp accession numbers are shown as the row title and column title, respectively. therefore, we get six different segment-pcp data sets for the ubiquitination site prediction.

in summary, six ubiquitination prediction data sets are established based on the protein sequences from different literature sources and the pcp values from aaindex, which include three balanced data sets  and three unbalanced data sets . these data sets are used to evaluate the performance of different machine learning methods for the ubiquitination site prediction.

bayesian-based methods
a bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model consisting of a directed acyclic graph  g = , which has been widely used for machine learning and uncertain reasoning in many areas, including bioinformatics . in a bayesian network, the nodes v represent random variables and the edges e represent the probabilistic relationships  among the nodes. a bayesian network has a conditional probability distribution of each node given each combination of values of its parents, which represents conditional independencies among nodes. four different types of bayesian network methods are employed for the ubiquitination site prediction based on the six segment-pcp data sets established in the above subsection. these bayesian methods include nb  <cit> , fsnb  <cit> , manb  <cit> , and ebmc  <cit> . details of the applications of such bayesian methods to ubiquitination prediction are described as follows.

nb is an ideal, simple, and widely-used bayesian network model with all the features/variables {xi, i =  <dig>   <dig>  ⋯, n} as children of the target, which shows all the features of interest to the target outcome  <cit> . the nb model assumes that the variables  for prediction are independent of each other conditioning on the value of the target. an illustrative dag for a nb network is shown in fig.  <dig>  to use the nb network for the ubiquitination site prediction, we calculate the following probability function.fig.  <dig> dag model of naïve bayes

 pt|x <dig> x <dig> ⋯,xn=γpx <dig> x <dig> ⋯,xn|tpt=γ∏i=1npxi|tpt, 

where γ is a scaling factor . given the  <dig> pcp features of a segment, the nb classifier provides the probability of the state of the target .

fsnb  <cit>  is a bayesian prediction method based on feature selection and nb. the method starts with no feature in the model and then uses a greedy search to add the feature to the model that most increases the bayesian score introduced by cooper and herskovits in  <cit> . if no additional feature increases the score, the search stops. the final model will be used for the prediction where the features included in the model are the selected predictors. fsnb can greatly reduce the computational complexity of the bayesian network, especially for large-scale data with many features/variables.

manb is a bayesian network prediction method based on model averaging and nb  <cit> . manb calculates the probability of the state of the target based on the nb model containing each subset of all the pcp features and then averages the probabilities over all subsets. since it is unfeasible to calculate the probabilities for all the 2n subsets for large numbers of features, algorithms have been developed by exploiting the conditional independencies in  <cit> , which reduce the computational complexity from o to o. manb can therefore handle all the subsets of the  <dig> pcp features.

ebmc is an efficient bayesian classifier recently-developed by cooper et al  <cit> , which is based on scoring and search techniques similar to fsnb but in a refined manner  <cit> . ebmc is summarized as the following steps.ebmc starts from an empty bayesian network model and searches for the variable  that best predicts the target  based on the supervised scoring method  <cit>  in conjunction with the bdeu scoring measure  <cit> .

ebmc then searches for a second variable that, when combined with the first variable found, best predicts the target.

this procedure is done iteratively until no additional variable, when combined with the existing variables, better predicts the target. the model obtained is then converted to a statistically equivalent model in which the variables are children of the target.

ebmc then proceeds to add variables as parents of the target in the generated model, repeating steps  and .

ebmc proceeds in this manner until prediction cannot be improved.



an illustrative example of each step of the above procedure of ebmc is shown in fig.  <dig>  in the figure, node “t” is the target  and nodes “ x1”, “ x2” and “x3” are the variables . a detailed procedure for ebmc is described in  <cit> . ebmc has been employed for biomedical prediction based on different data sets including simulated snp data and real genome data, and has been shown to be effective and efficient for the prediction problem  <cit> .fig.  <dig> illustrative example of ebmc



regression-based methods
besides the four bayesian methods mentioned above, we also used three other machine learning methods for the ubiquitination site prediction based on the segment-pcp data. the methods include svm, lr and lasso, which are all regression-based machine learning methods.

svm is a non-probabilistic machine learning method, which tries to separate the classes by finding the maximum margin hyper-plane  <cit> . in particular, for the ubiquitination site prediction problem, given the training segment-pcp data {|xi ∈ r <dig>  yi ∈ { <dig>  1}, i =  <dig>   <dig>  ⋯, n} with yi indicating the ubiquitination class to which the point xi belongs and each xi being a 531-dimensional real vector of the pcp values of the ith protein sequence segment, svm finds the maximum-margin hyper-plane that divides the points with yi =  <dig> from those with yi =  <dig>  any hyper-plane can be written as the set of points x satisfying wtx - b =  <dig> with w being the weighting parameter vector and b is a constant parameter. when we solve the equation and get the weight w, we then have the model for prediction.

lr is another type of regression analysis method used for predicting the outcome of a target based on one or more feature variables  <cit> . in this paper, lr describes the probability of the possible state outcome of the target  by modelling it as a logit function: logitpyi|xi=β0x0i+β1x1i+⋯+βkxki+⋯+β531x531i, 

where logitπ=logπ1−π,xiyi|i= <dig> ,⋯,n is the ith segment of segment-pcp data and target label , βk is the kth parameter of the model, and xki is the value of the kth pcp feature in the ith segment . we can use maximum likelihood estimation to get the parameters so as to maximize the probability of the segment-pcp data  <cit> . when the parameter βk is established, we can use the model to estimate the probability of the prediction target via pyi|xi=et/1+etwitht=β0x0i+β1x1i+⋯+βkxki+⋯+β531x531i. 

lasso is a shrinkage linear regression method. for ubiquitination site prediction in this paper, lasso fits the linear model for the target of the ith segment in the segment-pcp data as y^i=b0+b1x1i+b2x2i+⋯+bkxki⋯+b531x531i, 

where xki is the kth pcp value of the ith segment, b <dig> is a constant, and b <dig>  ⋯, bk, ⋯, b <dig> are the model parameters for each of the  <dig> pcp features. the solution is obtained by min ∑i = 1n <dig>  s. t. ∑k = 0531|bk| ≤ s with s being the bound tuning parameter . we see that solving the lasso is a quadratic programming  problem. when the qp problem is solved and parameters b <dig>  b <dig>  ⋯, b <dig> are obtained, we can use the model for ubiquitination site prediction.

experimental method
in the experiments, java  is employed as the programing language to create the six segment-pcp matrix data sets from the different formats of the sequence data from different sources based on the descriptions in the “data sets” subsection. discretization is also applied on the segment-pcp data sets in java so that bayesian-based machine learning methods can be used on the data. in each segment-pcp dataset, the discretization is based on the values of each pcp feature , which are divided into three equal-interval ranges. each pcp value is replaced by one of the three discreet values  based on the range in which it belongs.

for the seven machine learning methods, java and matlab  <cit>  are both used to implement the methods for ubiquitination site prediction. in particular, the bayesian-based methods  are implemented in java, and the ebmc java package we used is now an official package in weka ; svm and lr are implemented in matlab using the liblinear  <cit>  package; and lasso is implemented in java using the “lasso4j”  package. we conducted experiments in the eclipse environment  for the java implementations, and in the matlab 2013a environment  <cit>  for the matlab implementations. experiments were conducted on a dell poweredge r <dig> server which has a  <dig>  ghz  amd opteron  <dig> and 128g ram memory. note that in the experiments concerning svm and lr using liblinear, we used different penalty parameters by setting parameter “-wi” for different classes  in order to handle large differences in the numbers of cases in the two classes   <cit> .

to evaluate the performance of different methods for ubiquitination site prediction, the auroc is used as the performance criterion, while p-value and outperformance percentage are also used to compare the aurocs between methods. note that the p-value is obtained based on t-test by using matlab function “ttest”  <cit> . five-fold cross-validation  <cit>  is employed in the experiment to get a testing auroc for each segment-pcp data set. specifically, each segment-pcp data set is divided into five parts based on the proportion between ubiquitination and non-ubiquitination in the whole segment-pcp data set. in each fold, one part of the five parts of the data set was selected as the testing data while the remaining four parts were considered as the training data  <cit> . this is repeated for all five parts and the final auroc is the average value of all aucs of five folds. in addition, computational time is also presented to evaluate the efficiency of the presented ubiquitination site prediction methods, which is calculated as the total running time used to conduct all the five folds of cross-validation, including all training and testing times for the prediction.

RESULTS
in this section, the experiment results for different methods for ubiquitination site prediction are presented, described, and compared based on segment-pcp data. the results are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and fig.  <dig> table  <dig> auroc of ubiquitination prediction results from different methods based on different segment-pcp data sets







fig.  <dig> auroc comparison of different machine learning methods for ubiquitination prediction using different data sets



table  <dig> and fig.  <dig> show the testing auroc of the ubiquitination site prediction outcome of each method for each segment-pcp data set. from the table and the figure, we can see that most of the methods obtain aurocs between  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the six segment-pcp data sets. this shows that the segment-pcp data contain useful information that could be used for the ubiquitination site prediction, and also demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning methods for mining information from the segment-pcp data for the prediction.

from table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  we can find that ebmc, svm and lr perform similarly with each other in one tier for most of the six segment-pcp data sets, and the three other bayesian methods  perform similarly with each other in another tier. however, the former group has better aurocs than the latter one. also, we can see that ebmc and lr have better auroc values than svm for most of the data sets . for lasso, we can see that it has similar auroc values with the first group for balanced data sets , while it has all  <dig>  aucs for the three unbalanced data sets . this shows that lasso could perform well with balanced data but not with unbalanced data for the ubiquitination site prediction. in a word, ebmc, lr and svm have better performance for prediction than other methods. in addition, ebmc, lr and svm could also perform better than some of the existing ubiquitination prediction tools like ubipred  <cit> , cksaap_ubsite  <cit>  and ubpred  <cit>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   as compared to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ), as shown in fig.  <dig> of  <cit>  for the same protein sequence set  as data set  <dig> in additional file  <dig> of this paper. also, ebmc even performs better than ubpred  for the same protein sequence set  as data set  <dig> in additional file  <dig> of this paper, as shown in fig.  <dig> of  <cit> .

from table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  we can also see that ebmc is the only method that has all the aurocs greater than or equal to  <dig>  for all the six data sets, which shows its superiority for ubiquitination site prediction, as compared with the other six machine learning methods. moreover, from the table and the figure together with table  <dig>  we see that ebmc can get increasing aurocs as the size  of the data set increases, especially for unbalanced data sets 4- <dig> in additional file  <dig>  in particular, the auroc for ebmc prediction outcome increases from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as the size of data set increases from  <dig> segments  to  <dig> segments . we do not observe something like this in the auroc results for svm and lr. also, we see that ebmc gets the best auroc of  <dig>  for the biggest data set , among all the seven machine learning methods. this result illustrates the prediction capacity of ebmc for large-scale data. that is, ebmc tends to perform better for larger data sets. in addition, we have also checked the sensitivity values at 10 % false positive rate control for ebmc predicted outcomes. such values for ebmc are between  <dig>  and  <dig> , which are significantly better than the random guessing rate . this shows the effectiveness of ebmc for ubiquitination prediction even at low false positive rate control.

table  <dig> shows the statistical analysis  of the auroc results between ebmc and the other six machine learning methods for four groups of segment-pcp data sets . on the one hand, we can see that ebmc significantly outperforms nb, fsnb, manb and lasso by more than 15 % with p-value smaller than  <dig>  based on the auroc results for all six data sets. for example, ebmc outperforms nb by  <dig>  % with p-value being  <dig> , and ebmc outperforms lasso by  <dig>  % with p-value being  <dig> . for the three balanced data sets, ebmc also significantly outperforms other three bayesian methods by more than 18 %. for instance, ebmc outperforms nb by  <dig>  % with p-value being  <dig> . for the three unbalanced data sets, ebmc also significantly performs by more than 8 % relative to nb, manb and lasso . for the four large-scale data sets, ebmc performs significantly better than the other three bayesian-based methods and lasso as well, with outperformance percentages more than 13 % and p-values less than  <dig> .

on the other hand, from table  <dig>  we see that the outcomes for ebmc are comparable with svm and lr. the outcome for ebmc for balanced data sets is slightly  better than svm, while the outcome for svm for unbalanced data sets is slightly  better than ebmc. the overall outcome of ebmc is slightly  better than svm for the four different groups of data sets. we also see that lr performs slightly  better than ebmc. however, all the p-values of these comparisons are much bigger than  <dig> . based on these results, it is hard to say which of these three methods  significantly performs better than others, but we could say that they are comparable for ubiquitination site prediction.

in addition, table  <dig> shows the computational time  of the seven different machine-learning methods for ubiquitination predictions for the six data sets. the table demonstrates that the computational time is reasonable for practical use of ubiquitination site prediction, since the maximal computational time is less than 33 min . from the table, we can see nb and lasso use a few seconds to finish the calculation of prediction, while manb, svm and lr take less than a minute to do the training and prediction for any of the six data sets. ebmc and fsnb seem to take more time to finish the computations in many cases. however, ebmc could be more efficient than other methods in some cases. for example, for the 676-segment small data set , ebmc takes  <dig>  s to finish the calculation, which is less than the  <dig>  s required by svm. for the largest data set , ebmc takes  <dig>  s  for the computation, which is about ¼ of the time  used by fsnb. all these demonstrate the efficiency of the seven methods  for ubiquitination site prediction using segment-pcp data, including for large-scale data.

in summary, the experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented seven machine learning methods for mining information from pcp data of protein sequences in order to predict ubiquitination sites. results also demonstrate that ebmc, svm and lr perform better than other methods, while ebmc tends to perform better for large-scale data  as compared with other methods. these results could be helpful for the development of new ubiquitination prediction tools.

discussion
according to the experiment results for six different segment-pcp data sets described in the previous section, we see that pcp is an important biological property of protein sequences, which can be used for ubiquitination site prediction. also, the pcp averaging strategy over all the aas on the segment around central lysine k site is an effective way to gain information from each protein site for ubiquitination prediction. although the pcp averaging strategy has been shown to be effective for ubiquitination site prediction, whether there are better strategies to summarize pcp values over the sequence that could improve the prediction is a very interested topic for future study. moreover, since we used all the  <dig> pcps as features for the ubiquitination prediction in this paper, whether there is a subset of the  <dig> pcps that could be more informative for the prediction is another research topic that could be further investigated.

in this paper, the lengths of the protein sequence segments are fixed . can different lengths of protein segments affect the prediction outcome? is there an optimal segment length for ubiquitination site prediction? do longer segments contain more information for prediction? these are all interesting questions that can be further investigated. optimal length selection methods might be developed for protein site prediction to address these questions.

the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the seven presented machine learning methods for ubiquitination site prediction using pcp data. when initially conducting the experiments for svm, lr, and lasso, we found that these three methods could not handle unbalanced data sets  as evidenced by their  <dig>  auc outcomes. this is because they over-fit the major class . all four bayesian network methods don’t have this over-fitting problem, which shows the superiority of bayesian network methods to handle unbalanced data, as compared with other regression methods. to deal with the over-fitting problems of svm and lr, we set different penalty values for the major class and the minor class as mentioned in subsection “experimental method”. by doing this, svm and lr get comparable results with ebmc, which are better than other presented methods. note that the overall performance of ebmc is still slightly better than that of svm, and ebmc also tends to perform better than svm and lr for large-scale data sets. however, these comparisons are not significant. also, the experiment results show that embc may take longer computational time for the ubiquitination prediction as compared with other methods. thus, ebmc can be further improved to try to get significantly better prediction outcome and reduce computational time when comparing with traditional machine learning methods, such as svm and lr.

in addition, the paper focuses on the ubiquitination site  prediction. the other  <dig> aas are also important components of proteins and have their own biological functions. the presented data processing approaches and prediction methods can also be extended for the prediction of other protein aa sites. extension of ubiquitination site prediction methods to strategies for other protein site prediction is also an interesting future research topic.

CONCLUSIONS
we established six segment-pcp data sets for ubiquitination site prediction based on pcp information from aaindex and protein sequences from different literature sources via an averaging technique. to mine information from the six established data sets for prediction, seven machine learning methods including bayesian-based and regression-based methods  have been presented, compared and evaluated by cross-validation and auroc criterion. the computationally experimental results show that pcp over the protein sequence segment is a useful type of feature for ubiquitination site prediction. the results also demonstrated the effectiveness of the presented machine learning methods for mining information from segment-pcp data for prediction. comparisons illustrated the superior performance of ebmc, svm and lr  for ubiquitination site prediction, as compared with other methods. comparison results could be useful for development for a new ubiquitination prediction tool. future research may lie in the strategy of summarizing pcp over protein sequence segments, the informative pcp feature selection algorithm, the optimal length selection method of protein sequence segments, improvement of the ebmc algorithm, extension of the presented data processing and prediction approaches to the prediction of other protein sites, and development of future protein site prediction tools. .
