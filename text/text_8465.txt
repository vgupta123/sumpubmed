BACKGROUND
the development of genomic resources is a key step towards further investigation of wide-scale genome evolution, identification and study of gene or gene networks involved in complex characters. such efforts have naturally focussed on genetic model systems and species of applied biomedical or agronomical importance. in the case of rainbow trout, genetic resources have been primarily developed in order to study the gene networks controlling the phenotype of traits that affect breeding performances or fisheries sustainability and to identify mutations responsible for the genetic variation of these traits. however, the rainbow trout is also a suitable model to investigate more academic scientific questions , such as the evolution of duplicated genomes. two genome duplications seem to have taken place during the early evolution of vertebrates. studies based on hox clusters in several ray-finned fishes and recent comparative analyses of takifugu and tetraodon genomes with the human genome have supported the view that a third whole genome duplication occurred in the ray-finned fish lineage approximately  <dig> my ago  <cit> . the salmonid family has undergone an additional fourth genome duplication  <cit>  which occurred 25– <dig> my ago. therefore, the salmonids offer the opportunity to study evolution of duplicated genomes at much earlier stages after a polyploidisation event.

the construction of linkage maps is a primary step towards the description and understanding of the structure and evolution of whole genomes. in rainbow trout, several linkage maps based on segregations at aflp and microsatellite loci have been already published  <cit>  and successfully used to map qtl for growth, disease susceptibility, thermal tolerance, early development  <cit>  or to study the duplicated status and chromosomal localisation of gene families playing critical roles in major functions  <cit> .

these linkage maps have allowed to ascertain several important features of the meiosis and genome structure in the rainbow trout. briefly, female maps are three to four times longer than male ones on the average, while telomeric regions show higher average recombination rate in male than in female  <cit> . several homeologous regions sharing homology due to the recent tetraploidisation event were identified. some of these homeologous regions exhibited pseudolinkage  <cit> . pseudolinkage refers to a non-random segregation of homeologous regions which results from preferential pairing and alternate disjunction of homeologous regions inherited from the same grand parent. it occurs in males only  <cit> .

the current consensus linkage map consists of  <dig> major linkage group  <cit> . since the diploid chromosome number in the rainbow trout ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> chromosomes due to a wide range of robertsonian polymorphism  <cit> , this number falls within the range of expected linkage group numbers. more recently, the rainbow trout genetic linkage groups have been assigned to specific chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridisation of bacs  <cit> .

in this article, we report a new rainbow trout map. the main objective was to cover all the chromosomes arms. this information is of importance in rainbow trout since, due to robertsonian polymorphism, the number of chromosomes and, therefore, of independent linkage groups can vary among families while the number of chromosomes arms are the constant basic characteristic of the rainbow trout karyotype. the construction of the map was based on segregation analysis of nearly one thousand microsatellite markers in two doubled haploid lines, which are currently used in our laboratory. a particular effort was made to map the centromere of each linkage group using meiogynogenetic progeny in order to determine the acrocentric or metacentric structure of each linkage group.

finally, since approximately one third of the mapped microsatellites originated from ests sequences, we attempted to recover conserved syntenies between rainbow trout and zebrafish by comparing the map localisation of homologous sequences in the two species.

RESULTS
number of informative loci
out of  <dig> microsatellite primer pairs tested,  <dig> did not give any amplification at two annealing temperatures  and  <dig> were monomorphic in the test sample and  <dig> were informative in one family at least. three hundred and eighty-nine microsatellite primer pairs were designed from est sequences. eighty primer pairs originated from usda est sequences, of which eight have been already mapped  <cit> . the annealing temperature was 58°c for all the informative markers. the  <dig> markers developed from the sigenae-est database were numbered omy1009inra to omy1513inra. all these markers including sequence, primer sequences, and pcr conditions were submitted to the sts database in genbank and assigned accession numbers bv <dig> through bv <dig>  one hundred and five primer pairs amplified duplicated loci. the two female founders of inra <dig> and inra <dig> were heterozygous for one snp at bx <dig> and only the female parent of inra <dig> at bx <dig>  a total number of  <dig> loci, including the two snps, were informative for the segregation analysis.

number of linkage groups
the comprehensive composite map was obtained by merging the data sets from the two dh families . this map consisted of  <dig> linkage groups and one unassigned marker. correspondences with previous linkage map  <cit>  and with specific chromosomes based on fish results  <cit>  are given . rt <dig> identified in  <cit>  was merged with rt <dig> here . in this study, linkage group rt <dig> consisted of two unlinked fragments, rt2a and rt2b. family specific maps consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> linkage groups in inra <dig> and inra <dig> respectively. four linkage groups  consisted of two unlinked fragments in family inra <dig> and only one in family inra <dig>  similarly, two unlinked fragments were found in family inra <dig> for linkage group rt <dig> instead of one in inra <dig>  as expected, no significant pseudolinkage was found in female meiosis.

centromere mapping and arm numbers of linkage groups
two to  <dig> loci per linkage group were mapped in the meiogenetic line . in all cases, the marker orders obtained for a minimal number of recombination events were identical to the ones found in the two mapping families. for twenty linkage groups , the loci showing less recombination were found within the linkage group and these groups were assumed to have a metacentric structure. these groups exhibited the highest numbers of double crossovers and almost all of the triple c.o. and quadruple c.o. events found in inra <dig> and inra <dig> families . double crossover numbers ranged from  <dig> in rt <dig> to  <dig> in rt <dig> while the other linkage groups had  <dig> double crossovers or less, with the exception of linkage group rt <dig> . altogether, these figures were in agreement with the hypothesis of high interference generally assumed in salmonids and the occurrence of one chiasma per arm in most cases at meiosis i  <cit> . under this hypothesis, metacentric chromosomes are expected to show mostly zero, one or two crossovers while acrocentric ones mostly zero or one. for each metacentric group, the distribution of the position of the recombination events across all the individuals of inra <dig> and inra <dig> allowed to determine the positions which minimized the number of double recombinants on each arm. these position delimited putative centromere intervals which were consistent with those of the half-tetrad analysis performed in meiogenetics and sometimes suggested a more precise localisation of centromeres . these  <dig> metacentric groups allowed to identify  <dig> chromosome arms, out of  <dig>  the segregation data in the meiogenetic progeny resulted in the localisation of the centromere at one extremity for the remaining linkage groups and led to the identification of only  <dig> arms instead of  <dig>  since rt2a, rt2b, on one hand and rt <dig> and rt <dig>  were tightly linked and formed metacentric groups in the meiogenetic family, these four linkage groups were likely to be acrocentric in inra <dig> and  <dig>  rt <dig> which corresponds to the chromosome bearing the sex determinant  <cit>  is also stated to be acrocentric or subtelocentric  <cit> . among the six remaining linkage groups, rt <dig> which showed a relatively large number of double crossovers in both inra <dig> and  <dig> families  and which was  <dig> cm in length, emerged as a possible metacentric group.

duplicated regions
the  <dig> duplicated markers were distributed over a total of  <dig> linkage groups . four linkage groups did not show any duplicated loci and eleven linkage groups shared homologies with two or more different linkage groups . twenty-two putative homologous segments were found. ten of these segment homologies were based on co-localisation of multiple duplicates. one linkage group, rt <dig>  shared homologies with rt2b and rt <dig> while rt2a shared homology with rt <dig>  the localization of the centromeres was compatible with the assumption that each duplicated region was located on a single chromosome arm  with the exception of rt3/rt <dig>  these two groups shared three duplicated loci which encompassed the centromeric region of the metacentric rt <dig> linkage group. marker orders and orientation with respect to the centromere were conserved between duplicated regions, provided that modifications in the order of very few markers were introduced in the comprehensive map.

map length and genome coverage
the map length estimated by the sum of recombination percentage between adjacent markers was  <dig> cm and was slightly lower than the value obtained with the kosambi distance as mapping function . this small difference probably reflected the fact that very few multiple crossovers per arm were detected despite the rather large average number of markers per group . assuming that the centromere positions lied within the intervals proposed , the total number of multiple c.o. events per arm observed in these two families was estimated to  <dig> only for a total number of  <dig> recombination events. in the meiogenetic family, all genotypes leading to double recombinants per arm were re-genotyped. only six cases of double crossovers per arm out of a total observed number of  <dig> crossovers were found. double crossovers per arm were not found in a majority of linkage groups even over long map distances since up to  <dig> % heterozygous progenies were found at distal loci. these finding also supported the hypothesis of high to near-complete interference.

comparative mapping with zebrafish
the comparison of  <dig> rainbow trout est to the transcript sequences of the zebrafish with blastn resulted in  <dig> hits with e-values < 10- <dig>  the assignment of the corresponding loci to the linkage groups of each species and the conserved syntenies are reported in table  <dig>  these loci covered  <dig> linkage groups in zebrafish and ten of them housed two or more loci. in all cases, zebrafish linkage groups showed putative homologies with more than one rainbow trout linkage group, irrespective of the duplication in this species. six syntenies were conserved. in both species, two of them involved two tightly linked loci bx296674/omy1233inra and omy1069inra/omy1125inra) while the four other ones emcompassed large gene distances. it is noteworthy that rt <dig> and rt2b appeared as a mosaic of non adjacent fragments of the zebrafish linkage group  <dig> and that, in zebrafish linkage group  <dig>  the synteny with rt <dig> was interrupted by a synteny with rt <dig> . a tentative functional annotation of the est-based microsatellites localised on the map was performed . strong to weak similarities with identified genes were found for  <dig> of them.

discussion
number of chromosome arms and genome coverage
the primary objective of this work was to obtain a map covering all the chromosomes arms of the rainbow trout karyotype. the map reported here was based on more than  <dig> markers and consisted of  <dig> linkage groups. analyses of segregation data in both and dh families allowed us to recognize  <dig> metacentric  and ten acrocentric groups. it is noteworthy that our classification was fully supported by a recent fluorescent in situ hybridization study  <cit>  which reported the same acro or metacentric structure for each linkage group in rainbow trout . therefore, with respect to our results and the conclusion of the fish experiments, it can be reasonably assumed that our map covers the  <dig> chromosome arms which constitute the rainbow trout karyotype.

our results, both in the mapping families and in the meiogenetic line, were highly consistent with the finding of high interference in salmonid meiosis . near-complete interference would be the more likely explanation for the absence of multiple recombinants per arm for some linkage groups and the 100% heterozygous progenies for some loci in the meiogenetic family  <cit> . if complete interference is assumed, the length of a linkage group can be estimated by the percentage of recombinants. in most cases, linkage group lengths were close to the expected ones under a complete interference model, i.e.  <dig> cm for acrocentric groups and  <dig> cm for metacentric ones in one family at least. two groups, namely rt2a, rt <dig> and one arm on rt <dig>  rt <dig> and rt <dig>  were substantially shorter than  <dig> cm. the coverage of these groups could be readily improved by integration of additional markers from the microsatellite already published  <cit>  or forthcoming linkage maps. overall, the total map length reported here was rather close to the expected rainbow trout genome length of  <dig> cm under complete interference . this suggests that the present linkage map provides a good coverage of the rainbow trout genome.

four linkage groups in inra <dig>  and one in inra <dig>  were composed of two unlinked fragment. this could reflect a robertsonian polymorphism or, alternatively, an insufficient local coverage of the linkage group in one family. in the case of a robertsonian polymorphism, the two unlinked fragments would reflect the independence of the two acrocentric arms. when considering two independent acrocentric chromosomes as a single metacentric one, 1/ <dig> of the progeny is expected to exhibit triple crossovers under complete interference: one crossover on each acrocentric group and one recombinant due to the co-segregation of centromeres from each grandparent. since we did not find any convincing case of triple crossover at these linkage groups, robertsonian polymorphism is unlikely to explain the occurrence of unlinked fragments in one of the family. note also that only two triple crossovers were found instead of  <dig>  when rt2a and rt2b are grouped, suggesting that these two fragments could be linked in our dh families as in  <cit> 

assignment of each linkage group to a specific chromosome <cit>  will allow to replace the current linkage group numbering by a nomenclature based on chromosome size as in other species. the adoption of a definitive nomenclature will require a clear identification of all the chromosome arm associations involved in the robertsonian polymorphism in rainbow trout

alignment with other rainbow trout maps and zebrafish map
a total number of  <dig> microsatellite loci were common to the female-specific maps published by  <cit>  and this one. syntenies were not conserved for eight loci which mapped to different linkage groups in each map. none of these inconsistencies could be explained by a misinterpretation of a homeology as a homology since the misassigned loci did not map to homeologous regions. the  <dig> remaining markers were correctly assigned to a total number of  <dig> linkage groups. the conservation of gene orders was checked for  <dig> linkage groups which shared more than two markers in the two maps. in most cases, inconsistencies in gene orders resulted from the unstable position of one marker only or involved markers separated by short distances. only rt <dig> and rt <dig> showed important discrepancies. despite the fact that four families were genotyped , in all cases, discrepancies in gene orders were detected in only two families, the two others being uninformative with respect to the order of the problematic markers. the correct order in these groups remains to be validated. the two maps were also congruent for the localisation of the centromeres. all the linkage groups which showed a centromere in central position in the map of  <cit>  were also stated as being metacentric in our map.

one hundred and forteen microsatellite loci covering all the linkage groups were common to the map of  <cit>  and ours. only nine markers were not assigned to the same group. two discrepancies resulted from comparison of homeologous loci.  <cit>  map was a male-specific linkage map obtained by genotyping androgenetic doubled haploid progeny. therefore, most of the microsatellite markers clustered tightly in the centromeric regions as expected in male and this map did not provide sufficient information on gene orders.

overall, both syntenies and gene order appear to be conserved among the different linkage maps.

the localisation of type i marker on this map has provided some evidences of conservation of syntenies between zebrafish and rainbow trout, though it is not the rule. of particular interest are the alignment of zebrafish linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> on the linkage map of rainbow trout and the complex architecture of the syntenies found. even if the comparison of the zebrafish and rainbow trout genome is still very preliminary and based on a crude assessment of sequence homologies, these findings suggest that chromosome rearrangements have been frequent between zebrafish and rainbow trout at least over long map distances, but that cases of conserved syntenies can be found.

duplicated regions
extensive gene duplication has been reported early in salmonids and has been a crucial argument in favour of the hypothesis of tetraploidy in salmonids. our data confirm several homeology between linkage groups already reported or hypothesized, namely rt2–rt <dig>  rt2–rt <dig>  rt3–rt <dig>  rt7–rt <dig>  rt10–rt <dig>  rt12–rt <dig>  rt14–rt <dig> and rt27–rt <dig> . with respect to these previous studies, two new homeologous regions were identified here: rt6– <dig> and rt9– <dig>  finally, a new homeology was suggested for rt <dig> and  <dig> which shared omy1401inra in this study and omyrgt6tuf in  <cit> . our finding that gene orders are conserved between homeologous markers is congruent with segregation data which indicate the occurrence of pseudolinkage between duplicated pairs belonging to homeologous regions. such pseudolinkages result from pairing between homeologous regions and alternate segregation  <cit>  and it is likely that rearrangement in gene orders would prevent or impede such homeologous pairing. our results were also compatible with the assumption that each confirmed homeologous region  mapped to a single chromosome arms, with the exception of the rt3/rt <dig>  these two linkage groups showed a meta and acrocentric structure respectively and the three shared duplicated loci were not found on the same arm of rt <dig>  this could eventually reflect a pericentric inversion involving one marker on rt <dig>  but this exception remains to be validated. when two homologies per arm were found, one of these homologies involved one single pair of duplicated loci. thus, the occurrence of more than one homology per arm remains hypothetical for the moment. although the occurrence of more than one strongly conserved homeologous region per arm cannot be excluded, it is likely to lead to rather complex configurations of chromosome pairing and to unbalanced segregations at meiosis.

no unique pattern of localisation of the homeologous segment on chromosome emerged from this study. the homeologous regions sharing the largest number of duplicated loci, namely rt2a/ <dig>  rt2b/ <dig>  rt12/ <dig>  rt14/rt <dig> and rt27/ <dig> did not include the centromeric region. this is in agreement with the models of tetravalent formation, chromatide exchange and conservation of homology between homeologous distal region of chromosomes proposed by  <cit>  and  <cit> . in the other cases, homeology could concern whole arms or be restricted to the region proximal to the centromere as for rt9/ <dig>  more detailed description of the structure of homeologous linkage groups, with the addition of numerous additional loci, and sequencing of large bac fragments mapping to these linkage groups, both in duplicated and apparently not duplicated regions, could be a useful step towards the understanding of the evolution of a tetraploidized genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the present work provides a linkage map which is likely to cover most of the genome and to identify all the chromosome arms. it should be very helpful to distinguish between unlinked fragments due to insufficient marker density, robertsonian polymorphism and pseudolinkage in future studies. in turn, this work should benefit from the other maps under construction, specifically from the information derived from male meiosis. in contrast with female specific maps which show rather uniform distribution of recombination events along arms , male specific maps exhibit more recombination towards the telomeric ends and could be more resolutive for these regions. finally, approximately four hundred microsatellite markers developed from est have been mapped in this study, which is only a very small fraction of this type of markers available in public databases. this provides a means to generate high-density gene maps in rainbow trout and makes feasible comparative mapping with phylogenetically distant model species such as zebrafish  or tetraodon  <cit> . our preliminary data suggest that conservation of syntenies between rainbow trout and model species could occasionally facilitate fine-mapping of qtls and, eventually, identification of candidate genes.
