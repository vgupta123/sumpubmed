BACKGROUND
the ascomycete ophiocordyceps sinensis  sung, sung, hywel-jones and spatafora   <cit> , commonly known as the chinese caterpillar fungus, has been widely used in traditional chinese medicine for the treatment of asthma, bronchial, lung inflammation, and other diseases  <cit> . the medicinal activity is from the complex of the moth caterpillar parasitized by the fungus and the fungal stroma biomass. the caterpillars, which belong to the family hepialidae, live underground in soil burrows in the tibetan plateau and feed on plant roots. when an infection is established, the fungus grows within body cavity of the insect larvae and eventually kills and mummifies them in the underground burrows. fungal fruiting body emerges from the front end of the caterpillar and pokes out of the ground in spring and early summer  <cit> .

the natural distribution of this fungus, however, is limited to alpine regions on the tibetan plateau and huge commercial demand has led to excessive harvest and a dramatic decline in its numbers  <cit> . as a result, the price for natural o. sinensis has increased rapidly and it cost as much as $ <dig>   per kg for top quality in late  <dig>  <cit> . although several fermented mycelial products from the anamorph  of the fungus have been commercialized in china  <cit> , the teleomorph, which is the component for traditional chinese medicine, has not yet been commercially cultivated. the natural population of this fungus needs to be preserved for the fragile tibetan plateau ecosystem and for sustainable supply of this natural resource.

ophiocordyceps sinensis occupies a diverse habitat on the tibetan plateau, which is the largest and highest plateau on earth, covering more than  <dig>  million km <dig> at an average elevation of over  <dig>  km  <cit> . it is surrounded by and interspersed with towering mountain ranges. its complex geomorphology and climate generate substantial interregional variation which results in remarkable faunal and floral diversity and high levels of endemism  <cit> . o. sinensis is endemic to the tibetan plateau and occurs at elevations ranging from  <dig> m up to the snow line  <cit> . this distribution pattern suggests that the evolution of o. sinensis was significantly influenced by the tectonic movements during the strong uplift of the tibetan plateau. the spread of o. sinensis, depending on the shooting of ascospores, is limited to defined areas in a mountain and is unlikely through discontinuous mountains. therefore, gene flow between different populations on discontinuous mountains is expected to be low, and divergence may have occurred  <cit> .

intraspecific genetic diversity of o. sinensis may also be generated by its wide host range. o. sinensis infects soil-borne larvae of more than  <dig> species of ghost moths, mostly in the genus hepialus and to a lesser extent in the genera hepialiscus, forkalus, and bipectilus  <cit> . coevolution between the fungus and its host insects may have originated a long time ago  <cit> . although the host insects in general have a limited distribution in the tibetan plateau and their distribution varies among different mountain ranges and even from different sides and habitats of the same mountain  <cit> , the greater mobility of moths may also drive the genetic diversity of the fungus.

to date, genetic diversity of o. sinensis has only been studied at the local level of limited geographic areas. three populations found in the north , the middle , and the south  of the tibetan plateau, have been recognized from  <dig> samples based on rapd analyses  <cit> . inter-simple sequence repeat  analyses of o. sinensis from  <dig> counties in qinghai province also resulted in three groups   <cit> . based on its sequences of samples from  <dig> localities in southwestern china, o. sinensis was divided into two populations   <cit> . however, its sequence analyses in another study did not indicate any subgroup for  <dig> o. sinensis samples from different geographical regions  <cit> . overall, the number of o. sinensis samples used in earlier studies was limited, and more samples from tibet, a major production area, should be surveyed. in addition, other molecular markers, especially protein-encoding genes, should be employed to clarify the genetic diversity and to refine the phylogenetic origin of this fungus.

mating-type genes play an important role in the evolution of fungal species. sexual development is controlled by a single mating-type locus  in the fungi of ascomycota. the term "idiomorph" instead of "allele" is usually used to describe the two alternate forms  at the mating-type locus  <cit> . mating-type genes evolve at a faster rate than other sequences, such as its and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  <cit> . although mat1-2- <dig> sequences have been used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among closely related species and usually provide high resolution  <cit> , other studies found that the variability of mat1-2- <dig> within species is low  <cit> . a putative mating-type gene  of o. sinensis was cloned in our laboratory. similar to mat1-2- <dig> orthologs of other ascomycetes, the o. sinensis mat1-2- <dig> gene contained the conserved hmg motif. the sequence homologies to cordyceps militaris and cordyceps takaomontana were ~50% between cdna sequences and ~40% between amino acid sequences . during our preliminary experiment, several distinctive base changes within the mat1-2- <dig> sequences were found among some o. sinensis isolates. therefore, this gene was selected to investigate whether it can provide reasonable information on the genetic diversity of o. sinensis.

the objective of this study was to evaluate the population distribution of o. sinensis from geographically diverse regions of the tibetan plateau based on nrdna its and mat1-2- <dig> gene sequences. understanding of the genetic diversity and genesis of o. sinensis should provide valuable information for the protection and sustainable utilization of this natural resource.

RESULTS
sequence variations of nrdna its and mat1-2- <dig> genes among o. sinensis isolates
fifty-six o. sinensis isolates from different geographical regions were used in this study . their nrdna its and mat1-2- <dig> sequences were analyzed. for the 531- <dig> bp its sequences, the detectable nucleotide variations occurred at  <dig> sites, including  <dig> parsimony informative sites and eight singleton variable sites. among the  <dig> parsimony informative sites,  <dig> were t/c base transitions; eight were a/g transitions; five were transversions of t/g, t/a, or a/c; and one was t/a/c substitution . most of these informative sites were located in the its <dig>  and its <dig> regions , plus one each in the  <dig> s and 28s regions . the singleton sites were not included in the subsequent haplotype analysis because one polymorphism at such a site was represented by only one isolate and such variation might be introduced artificially during pcr or sequencing steps. in addition, a 4-bp deletion was detected within the its <dig> region of two isolates .

detectable nucleotide variations within the 877- <dig> bp mat1-2- <dig> sequences occurred at  <dig> sites, including  <dig> parsimony informative sites and five singleton variable sites. there were  <dig> t/c transitions, seven a/g transitions, and six c/g transversions . nucleotide variations in nine sites resulted in amino acid changes. interestingly, the two isolates that had base deletions within the its region contained a 5-bp insertion within the first intron of the mat1-2- <dig> gene.

haplotypes within the  <dig> o. sinensis isolates
haplotype usually refers to a group of alleles at multiple loci that are transmitted together on a single chromosome or to a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . ascosporic fungi are haploid and haplotypes were identified in this study according to base change patterns at informative sites among individual isolates. for the  <dig> isolates used in this study, eight its haplotypes, seven mat1-2- <dig> haplotypes, and  <dig> combined haplotypes were detected . the results showed that one haplotype might include isolates from different geographical regions , and isolates from the same location  might contain different haplotypes.

for the eight its haplotypes , type  <dig> was the most dominant and it was represented by  <dig> isolates mainly from northern regions . type  <dig> included nine isolates mainly from southern regions . other haplotypes were represented by two to five isolates .

for the seven mat1-2- <dig> haplotypes , type a was the most dominant and widespread; and it was represented by  <dig> isolates mainly from northern regions . the next most common haplotype was type b, which included seven isolates from southern regions, such as nyingchi, baima, and garze. type c was represented by seven isolates from southern tibet . other haplotypes were represented by one to three isolates .

for the  <dig> combined haplotypes , type 1a was the most dominant and it included  <dig> isolates. the next most common combined haplotype was type 2c, which was represented by six isolates from nyingchi. other haplotypes were represented by one to three isolates.

phylogenetic analyses
minimum evolutionary phylogenetic analyses were performed with sequences of the nrdna its region, the mat1-2- <dig> gene, and their combined data set. in these phylogenetic trees, two major clades  and two small clades  were distinguished .

clade i  was composed of isolates mainly from northern tibet  and qinghai  with the exception of several isolates from southern regions . this clade received bootstrap support values of 86%, 73%, and 95% in three phylogenetic trees, and included three its haplotypes, two mat1-2- <dig> haplotypes, and four combined haplotypes .

clade ii was composed of southern isolates from southern tibet , yunnan, and sichuan. it had bootstrap support of 91%, 60%, and 64% in the three phylogenetic trees, and included three its haplotypes, three mat1-2- <dig> haplotypes, and eight combined haplotypes .

two southern isolates, xz-sn- <dig> and xz-lz05- <dig>  clustered together as the third clade , having 97%, 99%, and 99% bootstrap support in the three trees . the southern isolates xz-lz07-h <dig> and xz-lz07-h <dig> formed the fourth clade  and had a distant relationship with other isolates . among all tested isolates, the maximal its distance value was  <dig>  between xz-lz07-h <dig> and qh-ql- <dig> or qh-ql- <dig>  the maximal mat1-2- <dig> distance value was  <dig>  between yn- <dig> and xz-lz07-h <dig> or xz-lz07-h <dig> 

the phylogenetic trees constructed with its sequences and with mat1-2- <dig> sequences had very similar topological structures . four clades were discriminated in both trees, and composition of isolates for each clade was almost identical between the two trees. however, there were some discrepancies between the two trees. for example, isolate sc- <dig> clustered in clade ii in the its tree, but in clade i in the mat1-2- <dig> tree. clade ii was the sister group of clade iii in the its tree, but the sister group of clade i in the mat1-2- <dig> tree. the parameters of nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity were usually higher in the its sequences than in the mat1-2- <dig> sequences . therefore, the its sequence is relatively more polymorphic than the mat1-2- <dig> sequence.

a fifty-six individuals were sequenced in this study . "n" or "s" inside parentheses represents northern or southern populations, respectively . numbers outside parentheses are values of its, and numbers inside parentheses are values of mat1-2- <dig> . b genetic parameters of the shannan population and the unknown population  are included in the "southern regions" and "overall" statistics, but they are not given individually because they each possess one isolate.c the "polymorphic sites" include both informative sites and singleton sites. for both its and mat1-2- <dig>  there is one polymorphic site shared by northern and southern isolates.

population structure and gene flow
for both its and mat1-2- <dig>  significant genetic differentiation was detected among isolates in nyingchi versus yushu, nagqu, chamdo, and garze; garze versus nagqu, chamdo, and nyingchi; and baima versus yushu, nagqu, and chamdo . in addition, there was also significant differentiation for its sequences among isolates in nagqu versus qilian; nyingchi versus qilian; and garze versus yushu . analyses of molecular variance  based on haplotype frequencies showed significant fct values in the following population grouping patterns:  ;   ;   ; and     . significant difference  was observed for these grouping patterns. these results indicate that an organized population structure exists among o. sinensis isolates.

its heterogeneity by pcr-sscp analyses
in total,  <dig> its clones  were analyzed by sscp. ninety-one clones with different sscp patterns  were sequenced . compared with the corresponding original sequence from direct sequencing, no its heterogeneity was detected for clones from each of these specimens except for xz-nq- <dig> and xz-lz07-h <dig>  which had three  and  <dig> informative sites , respectively . high nucleotide diversity  and haplotype diversity  were observed among clones of xz-lz07-h <dig>  the 4-bp sequence deletion in xz-lz07-h <dig> from direct sequencing existed within some clones of xz-lz07-h <dig> . among these  <dig> informative sites from  <dig> clones of xz-lz07-h <dig>   <dig> changes occurred at known informative sites and one at known singleton sites . every possible nucleotide change at these informative sites was shared by at least two to five clones. according to base changes at these informative sites, clones of xz-lz07-h <dig> can be divided into five haplotypes . the five haplotypes contained eight, three, two, one, and one clone, respectively . clones from the four northern isolates were clustered together in agreement with their original sequences from direct sequencing . similarly, clones from two of the three southern samples  were clustered together correspondingly with their original sequences from direct sequencing . however, the  <dig> clones from isolate xz-lz07-h <dig> were scattered among three clades . it is noteworthy that ht-94p clustered with the northern isolates .

discussion
the distance value  of nrdna its sequences from one fungal species typically ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>   <cit> . the maximal distance value among o. sinensis populations in this study was  <dig> . although five putative new species related to o. sinensis were reported based on morphological characters and geographical distribution  <cit> , they should not be treated as different species based on nrdna its sequences  <cit> . a high degree of intraspecific genetic diversity of o. sinensis has been detected, but it was still highly dissimilar even from the most closely related lineages within same genus, having about 10% of its difference with o. robertsii .

in general, mating-type genes are more variable between species than within species  <cit>  and the high degree of variations between species has been used to study the phylogeny of some closely related fungal groups  <cit> . in contrast to the low within-species variation  of cochliobolus heterostrophus  <cit>  and phaeosphaeria nodorum  <cit> , our comparison of  <dig> o. sinensis isolates detected at least  <dig> base changes within 877- <dig> nucleotides of the mat1-2- <dig> sequences , including nine nonsynonymous variations. this suggests that the unique geophysical environment and wide insect host range have resulted in a high degree of intraspecific genetic diversity within o. sinensis. mating-type genes are master regulators of the signal transduction pathway of mating  <cit> , but whether variations within mat1-2- <dig> sequence affect the sexual reproduction of o. sinensis is unknown. the fact that all strains contain the mat1-2- <dig> gene suggests that it might be homothallic, capable of self-fruiting. however, more study is needed to clarify the mating system of o. sinensis. this study is the first attempt to use a mating-type gene to determine whether the gene sequence differs among o. sinensis isolates from different localities. this is also the first protein-encoding gene used for the genetic analyses of o. sinensis isolates from different regions.

in this study, significant genetic divergence within the species of o. sinensis was revealed by two genes  and two main populations were detected: the southern population  and the northern populations . diversification among southern isolates was greater than that among northern isolates. in addition, significant genetic differentiation was observed between nyingchi and other populations. nyingchi has greater within-population genetic diversity than other populations. its heterogeneity was detected in isolate xz-lz07-h <dig> from nyingchi. these results imply that nyingchi might have acted as a center of origin of o. sinensis and o. sinensis might have been transmitted from nyingchi to other locations . o. sinensis might have spread eastward and westward first among southern regions on the tibetan plateau. this spread in southern tibetan plateau may be initiated along two large and parallel mountain ranges, the himalaya mountains  and the nyainqentanglha mountains , which run in east and west directions. the spread from south to north on the tibetan plateau might have occurred at a later time and this may be achieved by air currents from the indian ocean through yarlung zangbo grand canyon.

both o. sinensis and its host insects are endemic species on the tibetan plateau; and the geography and climate may have played an important role in their evolution and coevolution. however, the broad range of host insects and their distribution characters may also have impacted on the diversification of o. sinensis because the fungus must parasitize caterpillar to complete its life cycle  <cit> . host species of the fungal isolates used in this study and the genetic diversity of the hosts were not determined. the whole picture of o. sinensis genetic differentiation and the coevolution between o. sinensis and host insects needs to be further studied  <cit> .

two southern isolates, xz-lz07-h <dig> and xz-lz07-h <dig>  had relatively distant genetic relationships from other isolates. compared to the its or mat1-2- <dig> sequences of other isolates, the sequences of these two isolates had two fixed 4- or 5-bp indels and  <dig> unique base changes. according to the newly proposed "indel-associated substitution" theory, the high substitution frequency in these two isolates may be related to the existence of the two indels. the theory asserts that the single-nucleotide mutation rate increases in regions surrounding the insertion or deletion sites  <cit> . furthermore, its heterogeneity was detected in xz-lz07-h <dig>  but the potential sources of heterogeneity are still unknown. the fact that one clone of xz-lz07-h <dig> clustered in the northern clade suggests that hybridization is one of the possible mechanisms. inherent mechanisms involving slippage events during dna duplication may also be one of the reasons for the existence of base indels in the sequence of xz-lz07-h <dig> and xz-lz07-h <dig> 

the considerable base changes detected in this study indicated that recombination might have occurred between different o. sinensis populations. considering the difficulty of gene flow among different populations, o. sinensis may have an ancestral origin. according to a recent report, although diversification of insect pathogens within the fungal order of hypocreales occurred during the cretaceous period, the genesis of o. sinensis was an event during the cenozoic era  to present)  <cit> . we suggest the history of o. sinensis was not earlier than  <dig>  mya, because the altitude of the tibetan plateau reached ~ <dig> m in the eupleistocene  and it has kept a trend of rapid uplifting since then  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on two dna sequences , significant genetic divergence was detected among  <dig> isolates of o. sinensis collected from different regions of the tibetan plateau. the genetic diversification was greater among southern isolates than that among northern isolates, indicating that southern populations were important genetic reservoirs of this species to be considered in conservation programs. the polymorphism of nrdna its sequences suggests that the nyingchi district is the center of origin of o. sinensis; and that the fungus may have first spread from this center first to other southern regions and then to northern areas.
