BACKGROUND
cholestatic liver diseases are caused by an impaired flow of bile from liver to duodenum. a major component of bile are the bile salts, strong detergents required for extraction of lipids from apical membrane of hepatocytes into bile fluid and emulgation of lipids in the gut. moreover, bile fluid comprises numerous endogenous products  and potentially toxic compounds resulting from the clearance function of the liver. hence, accumulation of bile compounds due to cholestasis causes unspecific cellular damage that initiates a cascade of inflammatory and fibrogenic events in the liver. at the cellular and molecular level, these comprise, among others, necrosis of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, activation of macrophages, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, neutrophil infiltration, cholangiocyte and hepatocyte proliferation, stellate cell activation with progressive fibrosis causing secondary biliary cirrhosis, and ultimately liver failure or progression into liver cancer  <cit> .

multiple pathologies may represent the primary trigger of impaired bile flow, e.g. defects in export of bile from hepatocytes to bile canaliculi , obstruction of bile ducts by gall stones or local tumor impingement   <cit> . among the most common cholestatic liver diseases in the adult population are primary biliary cirrhosis  and primary sclerosing cholangitis , while biliary atresia and alagille syndrome are found in the pediatric population . the corresponding experimental model to induce obstructive cholestatic injury in mice and rats is surgical bile duct ligation   <cit> , which results in stereotypical histopathological phenotypes as in human cholestasis. the bdl experimental model has been well described and evaluated in rats and mice and is widely used to study cholestatic liver injury and fibrogenesis  <cit> .

chronic liver diseases , like cholestasis, represent with characteristic temporal morphologic, biochemical and molecular changes in liver and serum. for instance, in the bdl model, an early phase of acute hepatocyte injury is followed by a proliferative response of different parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cell types, up-regulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and metabolic enzymes, presenting as liver fibrosis after around 7 days  <cit> . such alteration dynamics can be exploited to identify biomarkers of specific stages of disease progression and disease severity. hitherto, semi-quantitative morphological scoring is the standard technique for grading and staging a cld. however, the availability of high-throughput technologies enables to flank the histological assessment of injured tissue with a comprehensive molecular profiling of gene transcripts, gene products  and metabolites, in liver tissue as well as in serum of patients and animal models. such analyses not only will provide a more detailed characterization and thus more refined staging of disease progression, they also lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular networks governing histological and pathophysical alterations observed at higher scales of tissue organization. the identification of key processes triggering the transition between different phases of disease progression based on high  throughput experimental data from different levels of cellular organization requires mathematical analyses, which take into account multiple parallel processes and process dynamics.

in this study, we wanted to systemize existing and newly acquired knowledge on morphological, biochemical and molecular biomarkers of cholestasis, and analyze disease progression following bdl in mice in a time resolved comprehensive manner. our approach sets itself apart from existing studies, which either describe the time course of a limited number of selected parameters after bdl  <cit> , or provide gene expression signatures for a limited number of time points, thereby missing the acute damage after bdl in the first 24 h and long-term effects after 7 days  <cit> . none of these preceding studies applied predictive models based on acquired time course data. therefore, a central aim of our study was to identify molecular markers for temporal progression of bdl cholestasis by correlating high-accuracy image data and transcriptional profiles of a set of preselected targets with pathobiochemical markers of obstructive cholestasis. we collected from  <dig> different time points after bdl more than  <dig>  experimental data points , comprising immunohistochemistry, biochemistry and molecular profiling measures. statistical methods were applied to unravel robust interrelations in this large-scale data set, and to find clusters of parameters corresponding to characteristic time profiles of disease onset/progression. we correlated level and timing of pathophysiological events with transcriptional changes, in order to define molecular markers, and developed predictive decision trees on a subset of biomarkers for the assessment of different disease phases as they occur during development of cholestasis.

methods
ethic statement
all experiments were approved by the local government landesamt für landwirtschaft, lebensmittelsicherheit und fischerei mecklenburg-voprommern  and performed in accordance with the german legislation on protection of animals and the national institutes of “health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals” .

mice
male c57bl/6 j  at 8– <dig> weeks of age with a body weight of 23–26 g were kept on water and standard laboratory chow ad libitum.

surgical procedure and experimental groups
mice were anesthetized by breathing isoflurane . bdl was performed after midline laparotomy. the common bile duct was ligated three times with 5– <dig> silk and transected between the two most distal ligations. sham operation was performed similarly, except for ligation and transection of the bile duct . all surgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions. animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and surgery under a red warming lamp and were held in single cages until subsequent experiments followed at postoperative hours  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , and at  <dig>   <dig> and 14 days after bdl . sham-operated animals without bdl served as controls . to analyze the regenerative response in regard to proliferation of different cell types, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine  was injected 1 h prior to harvest of liver tissue. brdu incorporation into dna was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. to obtain blood and liver samples, mice were killed at the indicated time points. liver tissue was partially embedded in paraffin for morphology analysis and snap frozen for molecular biology and biochemistry analyses. in addition, liver tissue served for the parallel taqman qrt-pcr using microfluidic fluidigm biomark™ platform .

hematological measurements and plasma enzyme levels
animals were anesthetized and exsanguinated by puncture of the vena cava inferior. red blood cell and blood platelets count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were assessed with an automated cell counter . plasma activities of alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase  and glutamate dehydrogenase  were measured spectrophotometrically.

assays
edta plasma served for the analysis of albumin as a parameter of liver function, which was determined with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions .

histopathology and image analysis
liver tissue samples were fixed in formalin for  <dig> to 3 days and embedded in paraffin. 5 μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin  for routine examination and quantification of bile infarcts. sirius red staining served for quantification of collagen deposition. all samples from a series of experiments were stained simultaneously and evaluated in a blinded manner. for histomorphometric analysis, images of  <dig> random low power fields  were acquired with a color view ii fw camera  and evaluated using an image analysis system . fibrosis deposition was quantified as a percentage of sirius red stained area compared with the total section area. the surfaces of large centrilobular veins and large portal tracts were excluded from this calculation. bile infarcts were quantified in h&e-stained sections in a similar manner and the percentage of the focal necrosis surface to the whole liver section area was assessed.

immunohistochemistry and image analysis
for analyzing dna-incorporated brdu in liver cells, 4 μm sections collected on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-brdu antibody  overnight at 4 °c, followed by horseradish-peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobin . sites of peroxidase-binding were detected by  <dig> ’-diaminobenzidine . sections were counterstained with hemalaun. brdu-positive hepatocellular nuclei were counted in a blinded manner within  <dig> consecutive high power fields   and are given as cells/mm <dig>  in analogy, brdu-expressing non-parenchymal cells were assessed and also given as cells/mm <dig> 

to specify the proliferative response of non-parenchymal cells upon bdl, we performed double immunohistochemistry of brdu with specific markers for different liver cells: f4-80/brdu for kupffer cells and sm22α/brdu for biliary epithelial cells . for each protocol, the immune-staining procedure for the specific marker was conducted after the brdu staining protocol. resident liver macrophages were analyzed using the f4- <dig> antigen . overnight  incubation  with the first antibody  was followed by alkaline-phosphatase  conjugated mouse anti-rat immunoglobulin . the sites of ap-binding were detected using the chromogen fuchsin .

becs and oval cells were detected by on incubation  with a polyclonal rabbit anti-sm22α antibody  followed by ap conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin as secondary antibody . the sites of ap-binding were detected by permanent red .

slides were viewed under a light microscope  and the number of brdu-positive cells co-expressing f4- <dig> or sm22α were counted in a blinded manner within  <dig> consecutive high power fields   and are given as cells/mm <dig> 

antibodies for detection of α-sma in hscs and of s100a4-positive cells were from dako . ctgf antibody was from santa cruz . sections were de-paraffinized in serial ethanol dilutions. after a pbs wash, sections were transferred into 10 mm sodium citrate buffer  and antigen unmasking was performed in a microwave. after cooling down, sections were incubated in peroxidase blocking reagent  for 1 h and with primary antibodies on at 4 °c. envision peroxidase  was applied for 1 h at room temperature after a pbs wash next day. sections were developed with diaminobenzidine for 5 min. the number of α-sma-, ctgf- and s100a4-positive cells was quantified under a leica light microscope  by counting three fields.

high-throughput quantitative taqman rt-pcr analysis
total rna was isolated from the liver tissue samples using rneasy mini kit including on column genomic dna digestion with rnase free dnase set . rna was reverse transcribed to cdna with taqman reverse transcription reagents . for quantitative real-time pcr, we used the fluidigm’s biomark high-throughput qpcr chip platform  with pre-designed gene expression assays from applied biosystems, according to the manufacturer’s instructions  <cit> . data were analyzed using the ddct method and expression values were normalized to the expression levels of the gapdh gene.

statistical data analysis
dimension reduction
a one-way analysis of variance  was applied to reduce the data set to the parameter subset showing significant  up- or down-regulation during the time course. multiple testing correction was performed using the holm procedure  <cit> . to specifically test for the initial changes, a two-tailed unpaired t-test  was performed for all factors between the classes 0 h and 6 h.

correlation analysis
correlation between two factor time courses was calculated via ys <dig>  a modified correlation coefficient based similarity measure for clustering time-course gene expression data  <cit> . the correlation yi,js <dig> between two factors i and j is the linear combination of three terms: i) a classical correlation part based on spearman correlation si,j*,ii)ai,*j* accounting for the similarity in changes between the two time courses, and iii) mi,j* comparing the location of the minimum and maximum values of the time course . si,j* is calculated on individual data points, ai,*j* and mi,j* on the mean time courses averaged over the repeats per time point. for the calculation of the similarity of changes within time courses, ai,*j*, we used spearman  correlation which is more robust against outliers as pearson  correlation: ai,*j*=sdi,dj+1/2yi,sj3=ω1si,j*+ω2ai,*j*+ω3mi,j* 

in the analysis, the following weights were used: ω1 =  <dig> , ω2 =  <dig> , ω3 =  <dig> . all reported correlations are y¯is,j <dig> values in the interval : y¯is,j3=2y¯is,j3− <dig>  

cluster analysis of the correlation matrix used complete-linkage hierarchical clustering with euclidian distance measurement. this combination of complete-linkage with ys provided the best enrichments on gene expression time series in a recent comparison of methods  <cit> . the number of clusters nc =  <dig>  was selected as maximum number of clusters so that all clusters contain more than one factor. normalization of factors was performed separately for each factor fk for all time points i =  <dig>  … , nt and repeats r =  <dig>  … , nr with nt =  <dig> and nr = 5 via f¯kti,r=fkti,r−<fk>maxfk−minfk 

decision trees
for the prediction of distinct time points of disease progression, a regression tree with the mean normalized factor data of the  <dig> clusters as predictor variables and the log transformed time points t˜i as dependent variable was fitted based on recursive partitioning using rpart  <cit> . logarithmic transformation was performed to obtain approximately equal distant time points. t˜i=logti+ <dig> 

the regression tree was fitted using the complete training set  with the minimum number of observations in a node, for which a split was computed being  <dig>  the minimum number of observations in a terminal node as  <dig>  and the complexity parameter cp =  <dig> . the splitting criterion, deciding which predictor variable gives the best split for nodes in the regression tree was st − , with st=Σt˜ι−<t˜> <dig> the sum of squares for node t, and st and sl the sums of squares for the left and right child. a leave one out approach was used to test the robustness of the predicted time classes and predictive performance: for each sample , the regression tree was generated under the exclusion of data from the sample with subsequent prediction on the left out test data .

the predictive capacity of the regression tree was evaluated using all single combinations of individual factors from the clusters  and a random subset of  <dig> two factor combinations from each cluster. predictions for a given combination of factors 〈f1〉, … , 〈f6〉 from the  <dig> clusters were scored, using the root mean square distance on log scale d, with the best combination of factors minimizing d. d=1nsΣi=1nstipre−tiexp <dig> 

all computations were performed in r with source code data and the full analysis available from http://matthiaskoenig.github.io/bdl-analysis  and additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
temporal changes of biochemical, cellular and histochemical markers after bdl
in mice, bdl over 14 days induces time dependently progressing stages of a secondary biliary cld. the first week begins with an acute cholestatic injury, associated with necroinflammation that is followed by a chronic injury stage, comprising hepatitis and liver fibrosis. macroscopically, marked dilation of the gallbladder and formation of bilioma are found, in line with weight loss and a mortality rate of 10 % in the first week due to bile leakage and rupture of the gallbladder  <cit> . pathophysiologically, bdl disturbs glandular liver function and hepatobiliary transport, comprising detoxification and secretion functions, including bile formation. obstruction of the bile duct leads to afflux of newly generated bile fluid. the main components of the bile, bile acids and phospholipids, induce toxicity and damage towards hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, therewith initiating the disease process. rapidly after bdl, mice develop obstructive jaundice and cholestasis, as displayed by markedly elevated serum transaminase activity and bilirubin levels , macroscopically evident from yellow ears and urine. within the first 30 h, there is a massive release of liver enzymes, like alt and gldh, reflecting hepatocyte damage as initial pathophysiological event in the process of bdl-induced liver fibrosis .fig.  <dig> analysis of liver injury and function. plasma activities of alanine aminotransferase   and glutamate dehydrogenase   and concentrations of plasma bilirubin  and albumin  at multiple time points after bdl. values are given in means ± sem of five independent experiments per time point



plasma levels of diagnostic liver enzymes remain elevated over several days, but then drop to reach values that were only slightly above those of sham operated mice until day  <dig>  concomitantly, liver detoxification capacity is deteriorated, as indicated by the rise of total bilirubin, a classical plasma marker of cholestasis . notably, the plasma level of albumin, an important parameter for the evaluation of liver function remains relatively constant over the time course of 14 days . the systemic blood cell count  shows constant levels of erythrocytes and platelets up to day  <dig>  in contrast, leukocytes decrease by 50 % during the first two days, reflecting intrahepatic cell entrapment, and recover to values of sham operated animals within the subsequent observation period. during progression of fibrosis, red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit are slightly decreasing.table  <dig> systemic blood cell count of sham-operated mice  and mice, which underwent bdl. values are given as means ± sem



in consequence of intrahepatic toxic bile accumulation, progressive development of confluent bile lakes is a hallmark of cholestasis. histological quantification of bile infarcts, defined as clusters of injured hepatocytes, reveals a steady rise of infarct areas until day  <dig> after bdl . the typical appearance of liver tissue at representative time points after bdl using h&e staining is depicted in fig. 2b. further histopathological changes of the livers after bdl include enlargement of portal tracts, dilation of bile canaliculi as well as proliferation of becs and oval cells , resulting in formation of artificial bile ductules , a cellular response termed ‘ductular reaction’  <cit> . recent data from lineage tracing experiments indicate however that becs and oval cells do not contribute to the population of ecm producing/fibrogenic cells, which in the bdl model is largely consisting of hepatic stellate cells   <cit> .fig.  <dig> quantification of bile infarcts in h&e stained liver sections at multiple time points after bdl . values are given in means ± sem of five independent experiments per time point. representative h&e stainings of paraffin embedded liver sections for each time point after bdl  with higher magnifications  in , displaying cellular infiltrates  and formation of artificial bile ductules 

fig.  <dig> analysis of the proliferative and cellular response at multiple time points after bdl. quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of brdu positive biliary epithelial cells , liver cells positive for α-sma  and s100a <dig> , brdu positive hepatocytes  and kupffer cells  and ctgf positive cells . values are given in means ± sem of five independent experiments per time point. corresponding representative immunohistochemical stainings are shown in the right panel 



the inflammatory response resulting from chronic hepatocyte injury is reflected by accumulation of immune cells in the liver, among others, t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, which are mainly found within and around bile infarct areas   <cit> . it is initiated by resident liver cells, primarily liver macrophages  and activated hscs, both secreting a wide range of cytokines and chemokines, which determine quality and quantity of inflammatory and consequently fibrotic responses  <cit> . upon parenchymal damage, quiescent hscs undergo a phenotypical change to myofibroblasts . the most prominent role of mfbs is gain of a migratory phenotype and extracellular matrix  production and reorganization, as reflected by, among others, increased synthesis of α-sma, type i collagen and timps. a marked increase of the number of α-sma- and s100a4-positive cells, as measured by immunohistochemistry, is observed after bdl . migration of mfbs to the site of injury and their contractility contribute to liver scarring and portal hypertension. this is accompanied by parenchymal cell proliferation, which begins at day  <dig> as regenerative response and which decreases at day  <dig> . with a slightly faster response as compared to hscs, kcs start to proliferate at the 30 h time point upon bdl . the overall hepatic proliferative response as analyzed by immunohistochemistry is confirmed by elevated mrna expression of ki <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis of proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation. mrna quantification of the proliferation marker ki <dig>  by fluidigm real-time pcr. values are given in means ± sem of five independent experiments per time point. quantitative analysis of extracellular matrix deposition  and representative histological images  of sirius red positive areas at multiple time points after bdl. values are given in means ± sem of five independent experiments per time point



between day  <dig> and  <dig> after bdl, periportal alterations are associated with fibrotic changes. as demonstrated by sirius red staining, extensive fibrosis, characterized by a several-fold increase of collagen deposition , including bridging, occurs at day  <dig> after bdl . we further stained for connective tissue growth factor , a prominent fibrogenic cytokine and enhancer of tgf-β effects  <cit> . appearance of ctgf-positive cells starts as early as 12 h upon bdl and their count increases continuously .

time phases of disease progression after bdl
to define distinct disease progression phases upon bdl damage, time-resolved transcriptomics profiles of three preselected gene panels relating to  hepatocyte metabolism,  fibrogenesis, and  inflammation were measured using the fluidigm platform  and matched with biochemical and histological markers. selection of representative genes for  adme-    fibrogenesis- , and  inflammation-related genes  was hereby made based on state-of the art knowledge.fig.  <dig> heat maps displaying gene expression pattern at multiple time points after bdl. gene expression relative to the gapdh gene, obtained from fluidigm qpcr, are shown as fold changes to sham operated mice  and are displayed in log <dig> scale. red colour indicates down-regulation , blue up-regulation  and white transcription fold changes about  <dig> . a selected adme genes,  selected fibrogenesis genes, and  selected inflammation genes



in a first step, anova was applied to reduce the complete set of biochemical, histochemical and transcript data, consisting of  <dig> parameters , to a subset showing significant  changes during the disease time course . this reduced the number to  <dig> factors, comprising two biochemical markers , eight -histological markers , kupffer cells, sirius red, bile infarcts, ctgf, α-sma, s100a4) and  <dig> genes . many of the adme- and fibrosis-genes were filtered out, whereas almost all genes of the inflammation panel were retained. the top significant factors were: cyp1a <dig> , serum bilirubin , il10rb, tgfb <dig>  ccl <dig>  cd <dig>  ccr <dig>  and mrc <dig>  within the filtered subset, a bivariate time-dependent correlation analysis  was performed for all pairs of factors to identify those displaying similar temporal profiles , with the top correlations for biochemical, histological and immunostaining factors depicted in fig.  <dig>  based on the obtained correlation matrix, a hierarchical cluster analysis was applied, resulting in  <dig> clusters with distinct time courses that comprise between 2– <dig> factors, and which, attain their maximum at different time points . the identified clusters comprise both ‘classical’ biochemical and histochemical factors as well as genes characteristic for a specific phase of disease progression.fig.  <dig> mrna quantification of selected genes by fluidigm real-time pcr displayed in log <dig> scale. a cyp1a <dig>   cyp24a <dig>   gstm <dig>   nr0b <dig>   col1α <dig>   col3α <dig>  , fn <dig>   il17a,  tgfb <dig>   il <dig>   il28b,  tnfrsf1a. values are given in means ± sem of five independent experiments per time point

fig.  <dig> time course clusters in bdl. six time course clusters  resulting from hierarchical clustering . the mean cluster time course  is depicted in blue, all representatives of the respective cluster in grey. the shaded blue area corresponds to the standard deviation between the mean time courses of the representatives in the cluster. the top correlations between the mean cluster time course and factors in the cluster are listed above the time course  with histological factors marked with h, immunostainings with a, and biochemical factors with b. the cluster members are fully enumerated for all clusters with exception of cluster  <dig>  the full set of members and respective correlation to the mean cluster time course for cluster  <dig> are: timp <dig> , bilirubin , ccr <dig> , ctgf , tgfbr <dig> , α-sma , ccl <dig> , tgfb <dig> , ccl <dig> , tnc , cd <dig> , ccl <dig> , cd <dig> , pdgfb , col1a <dig> , cxcl <dig> , ccl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , il10ra , col3a <dig> , il10rb , ccl <dig> , cd <dig> , ifnar <dig> , tnf , osm , sparc , il <dig> , tnfrsf1b , cxcr <dig> , il1b , timp <dig> , ifnar <dig> , ccr <dig> , il <dig> , osmr , gsta <dig> , il <dig> , ifng , ccl <dig> , hgf , bak <dig> , mrc <dig> , tgfb <dig> , ccr <dig> , actb , s100a <dig> , il <dig> , met , bile infarcts , il6st , tnfrsf1a , mki <dig> , birc <dig> , ctgf , bec , bax , notch <dig> , cxcr <dig> , gstm <dig> , cdh <dig> 



correlations between transcripts and non-transcript factors
the time course of each ‘classical’ factor contained in the anova-subset can be correlated with the expression time course of at least one gene . only for gldh and sirius red, the correlations are weak. notably, all top correlations to genes come either from cluster  <dig> or cluster  <dig>  bilirubin, bile infarcts and immunostainings , all have high correlations among each other, so do the brdu positive bec, kc and hsc measurements . gldh and sirius red do not show high correlation with any other classical factor. in the following, the top correlated factors are discussed in the context of different aspects of the disease process . 

initial response
immediately after bdl, there is a massive release of liver enzymes until day  <dig>  followed by a drop down to almost values of sham-operated livers . gldh and alt show a strong initial increase, whereby gldh in contrast to alt increases further up to 18 h, before its gradual decrease. gldh is highly correlated with members of cluster  <dig> , the early up-regulated transcripts fn <dig>  and sult1a <dig> .

initial molecular events with strong transcript peaks are visible at 6 h for members of cluster  <dig>  the transcriptional regulator nr0b <dig>  and cyp24a <dig> . nr0b <dig> was previously associated with cirrhosis and hepatic tumors  <cit> . a functional role for shp was supported by the fact that cholestatic liver fibrosis induced by bdl is increased in shp−/− mice  <cit> . additionally up-regulated transcripts at 6 h  are tnfrsf1a , il6st , osmr, cd <dig>  cxcl1/ <dig>  timp <dig> and hmox <dig> , the latter in line with reported marked increase in heme oxygenase activity following bdl in rats  <cit> . marked initial down-regulation is present, among others, for cdh <dig>  pde4a and the main enzyme of bile acid synthesis cyp7a <dig> , which can be interpreted as a fast and straightforward response to cholestasis. as underlying mechanism for such expression down-regulation, activation of the jnk/c-jun pathway has been proposed  <cit> .

macroscopic organ damage
necroinflammation is caused by bdl-induced intrahepatic toxic bile accumulation with individual liver cell death and progressive development of confluent bile infarct areas, as documented by h&e staining in fig. 2b. the total area of infarcts increases steadily with relatively high variance . bilirubin  shows the highest correlation with bile infarcts, followed by the immunostainings for ctgf  and α-sma . at the mrna expression level, gsta <dig> , gstm <dig>  and timp <dig>  display the highest positive correlation. timp <dig> is a metalloproteinase inhibitor that functions by forming one to one complexes with target metalloproteinases, such as collagenases. in contrast, cyp1a <dig>  and cyp2e <dig>  are highly anti-correlated to the bile infarct area, with cyp1a <dig> decreasing continuously after bdl, which is in line with observations in rats  <cit> .

loss of liver function
liver function after bdl was representatively measured using albumin  and bilirubin  levels. surprisingly, albumin synthesis is maintained relatively constant over the observation period of 14 days, and was consequently filtered out via anova. bilirubin, on the other hand increases continuously after bdl. the highest positive correlation with serum bilirubin levels is observed for the transcripts timp <dig>  cd <dig>  ccl <dig> , a soluble biomarker for hepatic fibrosis in nafld  <cit> , and ccl <dig> . notably, a very high negative correlation is present for bilirubin and slc10a <dig> , encoding the na + −taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, which transports bile acids as part of the hepatic sodium bile acid uptake system. the decrease in slc10a <dig> has been shown to protect hepatocytes from cholestasis-induced injury  <cit> .

hepatic cell proliferative response
during disease progression, various hepatic cell types start proliferating, as documented by -immunostaining with brdu and cell type specific markers , and which is indirectly reflected by the marked up-regulation of ki <dig> mrna . the observed time course is principally very similar in hepatocytes, kc and becs, resulting in a high correlation within this group .

hepatocyte proliferation occurs between 30 h and 2 days, as monitored by the parameter brdu-positive hepatocytes . s100a <dig> positive cells represent kupffer cells , which infiltrate the damaged liver tissue, become activated and proliferate starting at 30 h, to reach a maximum at day  <dig> and to decrease proliferative activity again thereafter. kc numbers are highly correlated to the transcript mki <dig> , a known proliferation marker, followed by the transcripts birc <dig>  and notch <dig>  a transmembrane receptor involved in developmental processes .

bec display the highest proliferative activity between day  <dig> and  <dig> after bdl, with minor activity after 30 h. interestingly, the highest correlations between becs and transcripts are all negative, namely cyp2c <dig> , slc10a <dig>  cyp2e <dig>  and cyp2c <dig> . from these, cyp2c <dig> and slc10a <dig> are interesting candidates, since they are with cyp1a <dig> and ppara the only factors from the top correlations  which are from time course cluster c <dig> and have high negative correlations with the classical factors.

increase in fibrogenic cells
in accordance with the reported proliferative activity of hscs and recruitment of kcs to the area of injury, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate the gradual rise in ctgf- , α-sma-  and s100a4-expressing cells . these markers reflect activated hscs and activated kcs. ctgf and α-sma are highly correlated to each other , with s100a <dig> having a strong correlation to both of them .

ctgf is a highly pro-fibrogenic protein expressed by hscs, becs and hepatocytes  <cit>  and mediates extracellular matrix modulating properties. levels of ctgf have been reported significantly up-regulated in experimental liver fibrogenesis and human chronic liver disease patients of various etiologies  <cit> . ctgf-positive cell number is the best candidate to monitor the disease progress among the selected biochemical, histological and immunostaining parameters, showing a steady increase with comparatively little variance . this is consistent with data from other studies, which observed a correlation of increased ctgf levels with histological fibrosis stages  <cit> . since ctgf can be measured in patients’ blood, it was suggested as valuable diagnostic marker with potential application in the follow-up of patients suffering from chronic liver diseases  <cit> . the highest transcript correlation with ctgf positive cell number shows tgfb <dig> , followed by pdgfb . tgf-β is the major stimulus for ctgf expression in hepatocytes  <cit> , and elevated levels of tgfb <dig> were reported for bdl rats  <cit> . pdgfb has been reported up-regulated in liver inflammation and fibrosis  <cit> . additionally, there are considerable correlations to several other genes such as tgfbr <dig>  encoding the transforming growth factor β receptor  <dig>  <cit> , cd <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccr <dig>  and timp <dig> 

α-sma-positive cells, representing activated hsc, increase steadily during disease progression , and are highly correlated to ctgf. consequently, the top transcript correlations are very similar: tgfb <dig>  cxcl <dig>  timp <dig>  tnc, and pdgfb. notably, α-sma staining, but also ctgf and s100a, show strong negative correlations to cyp1a <dig> , known as downregulated in liver cirrhosis  <cit> , and to ppara .

s100a4-positive cells, which are steadily rising until day  <dig>  after which they stay elevated , are also good markers for disease progression, presenting with a similar time course than ctgf , but with a larger variation from the 18 h time point on. many transcripts are highly correlated with s100a <dig>  e.g. pdgfb, birc <dig>  tgfb <dig> and notch <dig>

the progression of fibrogenesis is histomorphologically characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, visible by sirius red staining of liver slices . surprisingly, sirius red did not display high correlations to other factors , mainly due to the high variability in measurements from 0 h to 2 days, and therefore was in this study not a very reliable predictor for fibrogenesis. after day  <dig>  a strong increase in sirius red was observed. both col1a <dig>  and col3a <dig>  transcripts, which predominantly exist in fibrotic livers, show up-regulation beginning 30 h after bdl that continuously increases with severity of liver fibrosis up to 14 days. among the peptide mediators, tgfb <dig> and tgfb <dig>  expression is increasing after 2 days, confirming their postulated role as fibrogenic master cytokines  <cit> . tgfb, encoding the cytokine tgf-β is well known to correspond with the fibrotic process in a positive feedback loop  <cit> . further, its expression is associated with induction of fibrogenesis-related genes , which particularly are representative for hsc activation. the dynamics of the inflammation gene signature  nicely matches with the increase in the number of proliferating kupffer cells  observed from day  <dig> onwards . very low expression levels are present immediately after bdl, except for the chemokines cxcl <dig> und  <dig>  starting at time points between  <dig> and 5 days after bdl, most cytokines and chemokines in the list were strongly upregulated until day  <dig>  during the perpetuation phase , paracrine and autocrine cytokines amplify hepatic inflammation and hsc activation, resulting in continued ecm remodeling, characterized by enhanced mrna expression of both, fibrillar collagen1α <dig> and 3α <dig> .

markers of disease progression
main focus of this study was to detect factors and factor combinations which best characterize particular stages of the disease process. here, we discuss in more detail the biological significance of the six time course clusters.

cluster  <dig>  decreases continuously over time with no classical factor included in c <dig>  most of the members  are from the adme panel, with exception of rarres <dig> and egfr coming from the fibrosis panel. all members of cluster  <dig> have very high significance in the anova, but for rarres <dig> . the adme genes in c <dig> display decreased expression during late initial, perpetuation and progression phase. top correlations with the cluster mean time course are in decreasing order cyp2c <dig>  cyp2e <dig>  cyp2e <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig> , rarres <dig> and slc10a <dig>  remarkably containing many enzymes of the cytochrome p <dig> system. down-regulation of ugt1a <dig> , the main enzyme for conjugation of bilirubin, and slc10a <dig>  encoding the na + −taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, which transports bile acids, are protective against the increased concentration of conjugated bilirubin in hepatocytes after bdl.

cluster  <dig>  consists of strong transcript peaks at 6 h for the transcriptional regulator nr0b <dig>  and cyp24a <dig> , both probes of the adme chip. nr0b <dig>  and cyp24a <dig>  both present with very high anova significance. other transcripts also show an increase in the initial phase at 6 h, for instance members of cluster  <dig>  but none of them decreases to baseline during disease progression from 18 h up to 14 days. this makes nr0b <dig> and cyp24a <dig> the most interesting candidates for detecting the initial phase of cholestasis .

cluster  <dig>  is characterized by an increase in the initial phase up to 18 h with subsequent decrease during disease progression up to 14 days. the cluster consists of the biochemical factor gldh, the fibrosis transcript fn <dig> , and the adme gene sulf1a <dig> , making this cluster interesting because of the combination of various factor types.

cluster  <dig>  shows continuous increase starting in the initial phase, lasting throughout disease progression up to 14 days. consequently, members of the cluster are good candidates to predict continuous disease progression . among the top candidates are bilirubin, ctgf and α-sma. cluster  <dig> is the largest cluster, containing 61/ <dig> significant factors of the anova. notably, most of the classical markers are contained in cluster  <dig>  that is bilirubin, ctgf α-sma, s100a <dig>  bile infarcts and bec. all transcripts in c <dig> either belong to inflammation or fibrosis panels, except gsta <dig> and gstm <dig> . the top transcript correlation with the cluster mean comprises timp <dig>  followed by ccr <dig>  and tgfbr <dig>  with a large number of transcripts showing high correlation to the cluster mean.

the time course of cluster  <dig>  is highly similar to c <dig>  but increasing only after around 30 h compared to the continuous increase of c <dig> starting already in the initial damage phase. cluster  <dig> contains the classical markers npcs, kupffer cells and sirius red. top correlating transcripts are gdl <dig> and cyp7a <dig>  which show increasing values starting at around 30 h, despite a strong down-regulation in the initial phase . notably, the interleukins il <dig>  il17a  and il28b , altogether secreted proteins, are members of c <dig>  and are, likely detectable in blood, thus representing candidate diagnostic markers. il17a , plays a pivotal role in cholestatic liver fibrosis in mice by participation in activation of kcs and hscs  <cit> .

cluster  <dig>  is characterized by an initial decrease, followed by an increase in the late initial phase at 12 h up to 2 days, and subsequent decrease during disease progression at 5 days and 14 days. both cluster members, cdh <dig>  and bad <dig>  are part of the fibrosis panel. cluster  <dig> shows a similar up and down regulation than c <dig>  but the increase starts later, the decrease starts later and the maximum transcript values are consequently shifted to a later time point.

the large majority of histologic parameters, cell count observations, as well as most genes related to inflammation and fibrogenesis increased with disease progression, either in a continuous manner starting in the perpetuation phase after around 1 day or latest beginning at day  <dig> . based on the strong increase between day  <dig> and  <dig> in cluster  <dig> , we conclude that transition from disease stage at day  <dig> to progression at day  <dig> can be easily monitored. this transition could provide valuable information for clinical practice, as serum bilirubin is among the top correlation candidates of cluster  <dig>  the interleukins  of cluster  <dig>  as well as the growth factors  of cluster  <dig>  all of which are secreted factors and can be measured in blood. furthermore, additional prominent candidates of cluster  <dig> are extracellular matrix components .

cluster  <dig> is representative for disease progression due to the continuous increase of factors starting already in the initial phase. counting ctgf-positive cells presents as the most reliable overall measure for disease progression at histological level, bilirubin at biochemical level, and metalloproteinase inhibitor  <dig>  at transcript level.

interestingly, no histological, biochemical or immunostaining based factors were found in clusters c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  the transcripts in these clusters provide unique time course information, which cannot be captured with the subset of analyzed histological markers, thereby providing crucial information for the initial and perpetuation phase, not attainable via c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> 

decision trees for disease progression
we next wanted to determine, which of the analyzed factors are best suited as markers for particular stages of the disease process. to this end, we constructed a decision tree  based on the time course of the normalized clusters . this so called regression tree allows to predict a specific time interval of the disease process upon combining the dynamics of factors from the clusters . the algorithm used for constructing the decision tree avoids over-fitting of data by balancing the number of knots against robustness of the classification tested by cross-validation. consequently, the decision tree assigns a cluster pattern to time intervals of disease progression, rather than to discrete experimental time points, which results in  <dig> time classes. interestingly, mainly time points in late initial and perpetuation phases  were merged into time classes, whereas the control , early initial , and progression phases  remained almost unchanged. robustness of predicted time classes and prediction performance were tested with a leave one out approach, resulting in reproducible time classes and good prediction performance, when using left out test data .fig.  <dig> decision tree for disease progression.  regression tree for the prediction of time phases after bdl based on mean cluster time courses . splitting rules are depicted at the respective branching points of the tree, with left branches correspond to ‘yes’, right branches to ‘no’ decisions. in addition to the cluster used in the decisions, also the best gene representatives from the respective cluster is shown above the decision rule. the regression tree classifies the data in six time classes  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, 6d, 14d with information on mean time, range, number and percentage of samples falling in the respective class listed. in addition to the tree based on the mean cluster time courses , the best tree only using a single gene transcript from every cluster is shown . the best decision tree based on genes, histological, biochemical, and immunostaining factors  is highly similar to the depicted best gene tree, with the single change of using s100a <dig> instead of col1a <dig> for the decision on cluster c <dig> and allowing gldh as equally good alternative to fn <dig> in c <dig>   predictive performance of decision tree. the predictive performance of the regression tree was evaluated using all single factor combinations from the individual clusters , a random sample  of two factors from each cluster , the best gene representative tree , and the mean cluster data . for all classes of the decision tree the histogram of predicted vs. experimental data are shown



the resulting regression tree exploits time course information from clusters c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  whereas clusters c <dig> and c <dig> are not used. cluster  <dig> possesses the strongest discriminating power, performing the important split between early phase after bdl  and later perpetuation and progression phases . if the mean value of a factor in cluster c <dig> is smaller than − <dig>  at a measured time point, this time point is classified as not later than  <dig>  h. a more detailed assignment of the respective time interval requires interrogation of additional clusters. the value of c <dig> decides between control and initial phase, with subsequent splitting based on c <dig> into early and late initial phase. analogue, the value of c <dig> decides between perpetuation and progression phase, with subsequent c <dig> based splitting in early and late progression phase. note that the values of cluster  <dig> appear twice in the decision tree, owing to the monotonous increase after bdl.

the predictive performance of the regression tree for the mean cluster data is depicted in fig. 10b , providing information of experimental time point classifications. all samples of control, 6 h, and 14 days are assigned to their respective time classes 0 h, 6 h and 14 days, whereas neighboring time points are combined in classes 14 h, 34 h and 6 days. in addition, we evaluated the decision tree based on a subset of factors from time course clusters, using either a single or two factors randomly chosen from each cluster, and used their values for predictions . even with only one factor selected from c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  surprisingly consistent classifications were achieved. as expected, the quality of predictions improved by increasing the number of factors. with our approach, we are able to predict control, early initial and late progression phases with high accuracy, whereas the intermediate phase of disease progression shows more misclassifications, in case of single and double factor analyses.

the best performing decision tree based on a single transcript from each cluster  splits on col1a <dig>  chain, c4), fn <dig> , cyp1a <dig> , and il17a , all important factors involved in disease progression . the best performing decision tree based on all factors, i.e. histological, biochemical, immunostaining factors, and transcripts, resulted in a highly similar tree to the best tree based solely on transcription factors, with the single change of using s100a <dig> instead of col1a <dig> for c <dig> splitting, and providing gldh as alternative factor to fn <dig> to perform the c <dig> split. by selecting a subset of good performing transcripts, a very good prediction performance can be achieved already on a small subset of factors .

individual variability
we observed a large variability for many analyzed factors, when comparing individual mice of the same time points. for example at day  <dig>  the infarct area varies between  <dig>  % and 12 % , and the collagen deposition area measured by sirius red varies between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % . similar inter individual variability can be observed for proliferative activity  or expression of collagen , to name a few. such large variation in parameters during perpetuation and especially progression phases are an intriguing finding, considering homogeneity of the experimental system and the relatively short time frame of 14 days . a possible explanation is different individual pace of disease onset or progression due to variations in susceptibility and/or repair activity to the damage induced by bdl. as a consequence, heterogeneous time courses develop, with highly affected mice showing strong signs of fibrosis earlier.

another hypothesis for this result is variable routes of disease progression. for example, one route is characterized by a strong increase in necrotic tissue and a weaker activation of hscs with lower expression changes of inflammation factors. another route is represented by strong activation of fibrogenesis factors, and finally macroscopically visible scar tissue. both routes are similarly connected to loss of liver function, however, histopathological presentation is quite different. the first route is depicted with a large amount of necrotic tissue, while the second route contains large areas of fibrotic tissue. such alternative disease routes could be of far-reaching importance for an individualized therapy, as obviously medical interventions avoiding necrosis significantly differ from interventions to reduce overshooting fibrosis. the design of the study, which included sacrification of mice after a defined time, did not allow to answer whether alternate developments, as macroscopically identified in late time points, can be similarly differentiated at earlier time points.

CONCLUSIONS
the time resolved analysis of a wide range of parameters in bile duct ligated mice has shown that many of the preselected factors share the pattern of increase throughout disease progression . particularly pronounced changes were observed during transition from perpetuation to progression phase,  <dig> to 5 days after bdl, characterized by strong increases of parameters, such as il17a, il <dig>  il28b or il <dig>  this information has strong clinical relevance, as it indicates a robust switching point, and human homologs of the respective interleukins are top candidates to be used as clinical markers. main points are summarized in fig.  <dig>  bringing the different aspects, phases and markers together.fig.  <dig> outline of the disease process. each box is dedicated to a specific disease aspect , which is represented by a commonly known marker  or by several markers. below , genes are given, whose expression is correlated to the factor above



our experiments also found previously unknown molecular events, which are probably elements of a wider transcriptional reprograming related to damage or tissue repair activity. for instance, there are strong transcript peaks for shp  at 6 h, which now needs a focused analysis to delineate the chain of molecular interactions causing it and the functional consequences for disease onset and progression or its repair.

based on time course correlation analyses, we found a distinct molecular and pathomorphological patterns related to disease phases following bdl. from a subset of parameters of these patterns, we propose a decision tree, such as in fig.  <dig>  as a promising tool for assessment of disease progression. notably, our approach allows prediction of disease progression from an arbitrary subset of measured parameters. therefore, as a next step, suitability of the parameters selected from the mouse model need to be confirmed for human patients as e.g. in  <cit> . in this study, the relationship of portal inflammation to ductular reaction and thus, the correlation with disease severity was investigated in nafld liver biopsy sections by analyzing selected inflammatory and broad leukocyte subset markers  <cit> .

translation from mouse models into human patients is challenging, however, should be the final aim of all studies with animal disease models. one major drawback is that animal disease models develop in a very short time frame, e.g. 14 days for bdl, whereas in human, a chronic liver disease in many cases requires decades until occurrence of a progressed disease stage. another challenge is that except from blood samples, no time course estimation of disease dynamics can be performed in human, since usually only one or in best cases a second biopsy sample is available for a patient. however, we believe that a thorough analysis of multiple parameters in such patient samples can be matched with dense time course analyses of animal models as presented in the present report and, upon further optimization, finally may lead to improved estimation of the patients disease stage and therapy decisions.

many of the measured parameters display quite large variability, which may be one of the reasons why translation of a set of such parameters into diagnostic approaches has not proven sufficiently robust for predictions in human patients with chronic liver diseases. the here suggested approach of pooling information of factors falling in the same time course classes could be a possible solution for more robust predictors in the future.

taken together, the detailed time-resolved profiling of mouse liver samples following bdl revealed a coordinated response, resulting in disease phase dependent modulations at morphological, biochemical, metabolic and gene expression levels, which can be used as diagnostic markers to predict a disease stage more thoroughly. such approach is recommended for human patient cohorts, to generate similar prediction trees based on estimating a maximum amount of parameters for improved diagnosis.

to further elucidate the regulatory network behind the disease stage related expression signatures, additional studies are needed, which have to include knowledge on transcription factor activation due to accumulation of bile salts and shared transcription factor binding motifs of genes belonging to the same transcript cluster.
