BACKGROUND
dna polymerase β  is the smallest human dna polymerase and the first discovered adaptative polymerase. the structure of the full-length protein of  <dig> kda has been solved by x ray cristallography  <cit> . it is divided into two structural subdomains, which have distinct functions. the first is termed the  <dig> kda domain and is located at the n-terminal position. it binds to single-stranded and double stranded dna, recognizes the 5'-phosphate group in gapped dna and possesses drp lyase activity  <cit> . the second, the c-terminal  <dig> kda domain, displays the catalytic activity of polymerisation  <cit> .

pol beta is the major enzyme of the single-stranded break dna repair and base excision repair pathways  <cit> . it is able to remove damaged base residues, nucleotides and abasic sites arising from various endogenous and exogenous sources  <cit> . thereby, when pol beta gene is deleted from mouse fibroblasts, hypersensitivity to monofunctional alkylation agents, e.g., methylmethanesulfonate, is observed  <cit> . furthermore, pol beta is able to bypass dna lesions which block the replication by the replicative dna polymerases. in fact, pol beta allows an error-prone translesion replication of some adducts, like those generated by cisplatin  <cit> . a large and readily adaptable binding site and a lack of 3'-5'-exonuclease activity facilitates synthesis through lesions. hence, pol beta seems to be involved in chemotherapeutic agent resistance, as its overexpression diminishes the efficacy of anticancer drug therapies using cisplatin  <cit> . indeed, in breast, colon and prostate tumors, a cisplatin resistance is often observed while pol beta is overexpressed  <cit> .

since it causes genetic instability and resistance to anticancer drugs, pol beta is a therapeutic target. within the last few years, there has been considerable effort to find inhibitors of pol beta with higher affinity and greater specificity  <cit> .

among the approaches that aim at conceiving inhibitors, the fragment-based drug design is a recent one, that has proven to be successful  <cit> . briefly, in this approach, two weakly binding ligands or fragments of the target are sought so that they can be covalently bound to obtain a final molecule, whose affinity is roughly the product of individual affinities of the two fragments  <cit> .

to use this approach, sizeable structural information is required, in particular orientation and conformation of both fragments in their respective sites on the target. this information, together with the distance between fragments, is used to define a linker capable of connecting both fragments without disrupting the global affinity. nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy is a very powerful structural technique in the fragment-based strategy, as it can detect weakly interacting fragments and provide distances between target and ligand protons and structural information on the interaction. in the context of searching a pol beta inhibitor, we concentrated our efforts on the  <dig> kda domain, defined by a protease sensitive hinge region at lys <dig>  its structure has been solved by nmr  <cit> . it is formed by  <dig> alpha helices, packed as two antiparallel pairs. the helices  <dig>  and  <dig>  are linked by a  <dig> amino-acid loop. a "helix-hairpin-helix" motif links helix  <dig>  to helix  <dig> , which is responsible for non-specific dna binding  <cit> . the alpha helix from arg <dig> to gln <dig> formed in the full-length protein is not folded in the  <dig> kda domain. the first step of polymerisation process by pol beta involves the  <dig> kda domain. moreover, the alkylation-sensitive phenotype can be rescued by expression of the  <dig> kda domain, suggesting that removal of the drp group is most critical during base excision repair  <cit> .

among the large number of pol beta inhibitors that have been reported so far, the pamoic acid binds to the  <dig> kda domain with a reasonable affinity  <cit> . its solubility in aqueous buffer makes it interesting for further nmr analysis. moreover, the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups allows simple chemical modifications, aiming at tethering other fragments.

this paper describes structural data obtained on the complex of pamoic acid with the  <dig> kda domain. a combination of computational approaches and experimental data obtained from nmr provided the exact orientation of pamoic acid bound to the  <dig> kda domain, allowing to propose a three-dimensional model of the complex. we found that pamoic acid binds to a site formed by helix  <dig> and helix  <dig>  which also corresponds to the single-stranded dna binding site. the conformation of the bound pamoic acid affords possible binding of a second fragment in its vicinity. the current work is the starting point to apply the fragment-based strategy, that is to say identifying a second fragment that binds in the vicinity of the pamoic acid site.

RESULTS
docking pamoic acid to the  <dig> kda domain
we used autodock  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to dock pamoic acid to the  <dig> kda domain of pol beta . structures generated by autodock have been ranked according to their binding energy with the protein and  <dig> lowest energy structures were retained for further analysis. with the force field used by autodock, the energy values for the best ligands varied from - <dig>  kcal/mol to - <dig>  kcal/mol.

systematic analysis of the  <dig> best docked structures revealed that all of them were located in a single site, although pamoic acid could move freely around the  <dig> kda domain during docking. close atomic contacts between pairs of protein-ligand atoms, with a distance cutoff of  <dig> angströms, were computed. nine residues, namely his <dig>  lys <dig>  asn <dig>  ala <dig>  lys <dig> on helix  <dig> and gly <dig>  gly <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig> on helix  <dig>  were frequently found to be close to pamoic acid. in fact, in more than 50% of the resulting conformations, at least one proton of ala <dig>  lys <dig> and ile <dig> was located within  <dig> Å from pamoic acid. for residues his <dig>  lys <dig>  asn <dig>  lys <dig>  gly <dig> and gly <dig>  over 20% of the  <dig> best docked structures contained a pair of protein-ligand atoms with a separation below  <dig> Å. mapping these residues onto the  <dig> kda domain structure indicated that they form a single positively charged groove at the surface of the  <dig> kda domain . interestingly, lys <dig>  lys <dig> and lys <dig>  which have been shown to be responsible for single-stranded dna binding by site-directed mutagenesis  <cit> , are located in the groove where pamoic acid binds to. as this groove is the one where dna binds, pamoic acid is likely to interfere with single-stranded dna recognition. clustering the  <dig> best ligand structures has been performed using an rmsd  cutoff value of  <dig> Å. the five resulting clusters indicated that the ligands adopt five different ensembles of conformations in the binding site described above . two conformations, n° <dig> and n° <dig>  were closer to each other than to any other one. the minimum rmsd value between these two conformations was  <dig>  Å. conformation n° <dig> showed the highest rmsd value with respect to other conformations, from  <dig>  Å with conformation n° <dig> to  <dig>  Å with conformation n° <dig>  rmsd values between others pairs of clusters were between  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å.

two other sites can be defined in the proximity of the pamoic binding site. the first site could be located further beyond lys <dig>  between helices  <dig> and  <dig> and neighboring leu <dig>  leu <dig>  glu <dig> or lys <dig>  the other potential site could be related to lys <dig>  leu <dig> and ala <dig>  further in the direction of gly <dig> and gly <dig>  which belong to pamoic acid site. since we intend to modify one of the carboxyl groups of pamoic acid to tether a second fragment to reach one of the other two sites, the precise orientation of pamoic acid in the binding site has to be determined.

chemical shift mapping confirms the pamoic acid binding site found by docking
in order to discriminate between the five different conformations, binding of pamoic acid to the  <dig> kda domain of pol beta was probed using nmr chemical shift mapping  <cit>  . this technique is a powerful tool to reveal an interaction between the 15n-labeled protein and the unlabeled ligand and shows which residues of the protein are involved in the binding. therefore 1h, 15n assignment of protein resonances is a prerequisite. a two dimensional  1h-15n hsqc  spectrum of the 15n-labeled human  <dig> kda domain, corresponding to the first  <dig> amino-acid residues of pol beta, was recorded. protein 1h and 15n resonances were assigned using tocsy-hsqc and noesy-hsqc based strategies and confirmed nmr data previously reported for the  <dig> kda domain  <cit> . a satisfactory agreement of hsqc spectra with the reported data insured that the protein is well-folded  <cit> .

a series of 2d 1h-15n hsqc spectra was monitored upon addition of pamoic acid. as the spectra could be easily superimposed, we concluded that the structure of the  <dig> kda domain is not altered upon ligand addition. chemical shifts of the crosspeaks have been followed during titration . the peak positions changed between those characteristic of the free and bound forms, indicating fast exchange on the nmr chemical shift timescale.

comparison of the two spectra recorded for the protein in its free state and in the presence of a 4-fold molar excess of pamoic acid revealed a small number of amino-acids that are affected upon ligand binding. the chemical shift changes d  of the same crosspeak between the free and the ligand bound state were plotted versus the pol beta residue numbers . amide groups of ala <dig>  gly <dig>  gly <dig> and ile <dig> showed a significant d value , indicating that these amino-acids belong to the binding site of pamoic acid. previous studies reported that lys <dig>  tyr <dig>  arg <dig> and leu <dig> were also affected by binding  <cit> . to characterize binding, we used a threshold for d value equal to  <dig> × standard deviation instead of  <dig>  as in the paper  <cit> . with the multiplier set to  <dig> , lys <dig>  arg <dig> and leu <dig> were also found to be affected by binding in our experiments. interestingly, chemical shift mapping at higher protein concentration revealed that lys <dig>  tyr <dig>  arg <dig> and leu <dig> were also affected by binding . however, arg <dig> and leu <dig> are located far from the other affected residues, on an unstructured loop, which is a part of an alpha helix in the entire  <dig> kd protein. these residues are therefore unlikely to be involved in the binding of pamoic acid to the entire protein.

furthermore, comparing the results of the in silico docking with those obtained from chemical shift mapping showed a good agreement. all retained docked structures are located in the site revealed by chemical shift mapping experiments, the one which corresponds to the single-stranded dna binding. among the five conformations proposed by autodock, conformation n° <dig> could be rejected as it was not close enough to gly <dig> and gly <dig>  which have been shown to be involved in pamoic acid binding. therefore, at this step, four conformations were retained.

a noe correlation helps in determining the correct conformation
in order to further discriminate the right position, we looked for intermolecular noes. 3d 15n-tocsy-hsqc  and 3d 15n-noesy-hsqc  spectra of the free 15n-labeled  <dig> kda domain were acquired and 3d 15n-noesy-hsqc spectrum was recorded in the presence of equimolar pamoic acid concentration.

pamoic acid protons  have been assigned in a straightforward manner using cosy-dqf, tocsy and noesy experiments . careful analysis of both spectra revealed the presence of an intermolecular noe correlation peak. the chemical shifts of this noe corresponded to the amide proton of ile <dig> and to the proton ha of pamoic acid, indicating that these protons are located within  <dig> Å from each other .

the atomic contacts were computed from the four retained structures by assuming that the maximal distance between a pair of protein-ligand atoms does not exceed  <dig> Å. among these distances we selected the ones corresponding to the amide proton of ile <dig> and the two ha protons of pamoic acid. the  <dig> best structures that fulfilled this condition were visually inspected and showed that three different conformations were admissible. more than half of the  <dig> structures corresponded to conformation n° <dig> depicted on fig. 2a. the two other conformations represented 30%  and 18%  of the full autodock structure set.

two important protons for the interaction between the  <dig> kda domain and pamoic acid
in order to get further structural information on the binding, saturation transfer difference  experiments were carried out. the principle of this technique is to transfer the saturation from the protein to the bound ligand  <cit> . protein protons that are shifted outside of the spectral window of low molecular weight compounds are selectively irradiated. within a short time, the saturation is spread over the entire  <dig> kda domain through spin diffusion. the spin diffusion is more efficient when the molecular mobility is restricted, which is the case for large molecules like proteins. the spin diffusion may also occur between a protein and its ligand, assuming they are close enough. the closer the distance from the binding site, the larger the saturation, indicating the ligand's binding epitope  <cit> .

we performed std experiments with the  <dig> kda domain at  <dig> μm and pamoic acid in a 20-fold molar excess. two pamoic acid protons were found to carry most of the saturation, namely hd and he , indicating a close proximity with the  <dig> kda domain. however, he carried a larger saturation, indicating a closer contact with the  <dig> kda domain than hd  <cit> . this structural information was used to select the correct conformation of the bound pamoic acid among the three remaining ones.

searching through the computed atomic contacts, we analyzed the distances between hd or he and protein atoms and found that two of the three remaining conformations did not feature sufficiently close contacts to give rise to std signals, namely conformations n° <dig> and n° <dig>  moreover, ligand protons that are closer to the protein than hd and he in these conformations did not give std signals. by contrast, every structure in conformation n° <dig> family showed at least one distance below  <dig>  Å between these two protons of pamoic acid and one of the protein protons.

std experiments were used to assess ligand affinity, as the ligand has been added gradually up to around a 50-fold molar excess with respect to the protein concentration. as std technique requires low concentrations in ligand and protein, it is less affected by interferences due to additional non-specific binding visible in kd measurements  <cit> . std amplification factor was plotted versus the ligand excess. assuming a stoichiometric complex, fitting the curve of the std amplification factor of the major proton he provided the kd value of  <dig> μm ±  <dig> μm   <cit> .

model of the interaction between the pamoic acid and the  <dig> kda domain
in the final stage of the analysis, conformation n° <dig> was retained to establish the model of the complex between the  <dig> kda domain and pamoic acid, since it complied with all the nmr data. this structural set of autodock results represents an experimentally validated and unique strutural model for the complex  <dig> kda domain – pamoic acid .

under these assumptions, we analysed the contacts between the validated ligand structure and the  <dig> kda domain atoms. the aromatic groups of pamoic acid probably form favorable hydrophobic interactions with the main amino-acids of the site, such as tyr <dig>  ala <dig>  gly <dig> and gly <dig>  amide protons of gly <dig> and gly <dig> are shielded upon pamoic acid addition. this can be correlated with the fact that both residues are affected by magnetic anisotropy of the naphtalene nucleus  <cit> . furthermore, numerous lysine residues present in the site can form electrostatic interactions with both carboxyl groups. one of the carboxyl groups is oriented towards his <dig> and lys <dig>  it makes close contacts with ile <dig> amide proton and electrostatic interaction with the terminal nh3+ group of the lys <dig> sidechain. the other carboxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with the amide proton of lys <dig>  and with the hydroxyl group of thr <dig> . obviously, the two carboxyl groups contribute to pamoic acid affinity for the  <dig> kda domain. using one of them to tether a second fragment is likely to lower the affinity but this may be compensated by the properties of the second fragment. from our data, we have defined two other potential sites close to the pamoic acid binding site . in the proposed model, each of the carboxyl groups is oriented towards one of the other sites. therefore the possibility of increasing the pamoic acid affinity by using the fragment-based approach could be considered.

CONCLUSIONS
pol beta gets involved in dna repair pathway and in translesion synthesis, particularly when it is overexpressed in cancer cell lines treated by cisplatin agent. this process leads to a chemotherapeutic drug resistance, which could be prevented by an adjuvant treatment, that is to say a pol beta inhibitor. one of the key benchmarks for a small molecule to become a drug is the affinity for its target. no currently known pol beta inhibitors rise above micromolar affinity, which is insufficient for any pharmacological development. the x family dna polymerases is the only one to feature the  <dig> kda domain  <cit> . hence, an inhibitor of this domain is less subject to bind to replicative dna polymerases. moreover, inhibition of the  <dig> kda of pol lambda and pol mu, both involved in non-homologous end joining of dna break  <cit> , could improve the radiosensitivity of tumors by preventing cells from repairing radiotherapy-induced dna damage.

even if pamoic acid is one of the most known pol beta specific inhibitors, its affinity  has to be improved. structural insights in the interaction between  <dig> kda domain of pol beta and pamoic acid are prerequisites to improve the ligand affinity by applying the fragment-based strategy.

a previous work has reported the binding of pamoic acid to pol beta using chemical shift mapping. pamoic acid is one of the best known pol beta specific inhibitors. it inhibits the deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity and increases sensibility to mms  <cit> . as pol beta has been shown to be a pharmacological target, increasing the affinity of pamoic acid for pol beta could transform pamoic acid into a drug-candidate. in the present paper, we have combined nmr  and computational approaches to generate a detailed 3d model of the complex of the  <dig> kda domain of the dna polymerase with pamoic acid. validation of the computational model by experimental nmr data gave a unique structure for the complex . the site occupied by pamoic acid corresponds to the one where single-stranded dna binds to.

indeed, the model thus established is the starting point to search for a fragment that could bind in one of the other two sites found in the vicinity of the pamoic acid binding site. the orientation of its bound carboxyl groups towards two distinct potential second sites makes pamoic acid a very interesting candidate for further attempts to increase its affinity for pol beta, using fragment-based approach. furthermore, as nmr techniques can screen small molecules, they can be used to find a second fragment which binds to the  <dig> kda domain in a site, which is close to but disjointed from the pamoic acid binding site  <cit> . the present structure of the complex opens an avenue for the development of new families of specific pol beta inhibitors by the well-established fragment based approach. glu <dig> or lys <dig>  another potential second site could be related to lys <dig>  leu <dig> and ala <dig>  further in the direction of gly <dig> and gly <dig>  which belong to the pamoic acid site. be reported elsewhere.
