BACKGROUND
otitis media  is the most common pediatric disease in industrialized nations  <cit> . om is characterized by hyperplasia of the middle ear  mucosa, the development of effusion, and leukocytic infiltration of the me  <cit> . the etiology of om is multifactorial, with eustachian tube dysfunction, prior viral infection and allergy  <cit>  all being factors known to contribute to om incidence. however, bacterial infection is common to most acute and/or recurrent om. non-typeable haemophilus influenzae , which since the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines is associated with an increasing percentage of om  <cit> , is one of the most common pathogens isolated from the me in om.

nthi can influence host cells through interaction with pattern recognition receptors, which recognize molecules produced by pathogens and which play a key role in innate immunity. they serve as the first line of host defense in infection, and they include the family of toll-like receptors . as illustrated in figure  <dig>  tlr activation induces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins , tumor necrosis factor alpha  and type i interferons , via signaling cascades including those dependent upon the myd88-nfkb, trif-irf <dig> and/or map kinase pathways. all tlrs except tlr <dig> recruit the adaptor myd <dig> , which can influence gene expression by activating downstream intracellular pathways. the most dominant of these is nfκb, leading to the production of tnfα and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. myd <dig> can also activate the jnk and p <dig> map kinase pathways with subsequent expression of stress and inflammation genes. finally, myd <dig> can activate the ifn response factors  irf <dig> and irf <dig>  irf <dig> mediates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while irf <dig> can lead to the expression of type i ifn genes . the alternative tlr adaptor trif  is recruited only by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  trif primarily activates type i ifn gene expression via irf <dig>  although via rip <dig> and with delayed kinetics it can activate nfκb and mapks  <cit> .

while me responses to tlr ligands such as peptidoglycans and lipopolysaccharide  are well documented  <cit> , the role played by tlr signaling pathways in om pathogenesis has not been as fully studied. in me epithelial cell lines, nthi induces tlr <dig> expression  <cit>  and tlr <dig> activation regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mucin genes  <cit> . moreover, polymorphisms in the tlr <dig> gene are associated with increased om susceptibility in children  <cit> . polymorphisms in the genes for tnfα, a major pro-inflammatory target of tlr signaling, and for il- <dig>  which often opposes tlr signaling, are associated with om  <cit> . experimentally, reduced short-term responses to nthi, from  <dig> hours to  <dig> days, were reported in the mes of c3h/hej mice, which express a nonfunctional tlr <dig>  <cit> . tlr signaling deficiencies have also been shown to induce abnormalities in the recovery from bacterial infection at other sites  <cit> .

we recently reported that myd <dig> deficiency significantly prolongs om and delays bacterial clearance from the me of mice by weeks  <cit> , suggesting that this adaptor molecule is critical for om recovery. however, om does improve over time in myd88-deficient animals, with the majority of mes clearing nthi by  <dig> days , suggesting a myd88-independent response to infection in the me. we also evaluated om in tlr4-deficient mice, and found impaired early bacterial clearance and delayed recovery  <cit> . in dendritic cells, both trif and myd <dig> are known to play major roles in responses to tlr <dig> ligands  <cit> . we therefore explored the potential role of the major myd88-independent tlr signaling pathway, which acts via the adaptor protein trif, in om.

using a well-established experimental model of om induced by nthi  <cit> , we evaluated the expression of genes related to trif signaling during acute om, to determine whether genes that subserve this pathway or are its targets are altered, which would suggest a role in mediating innate immunity in this condition. using trif-deficient mice, we also assessed the role of trif in om pathogenesis and me bacterial clearance. compared to control mice, we demonstrate extensive expression of genes related to trif-mediated signaling in om in wt mice. we also found that the lack of trif reduces and delays the expression of the characteristic histopathological findings of om, indicating a role in mediating pathogenesis. we also observed delayed bacterial clearance suggesting that trif contributes, at least in part, to antibacterial responses in the me. this paper presents the first demonstration of the role of trif in om.

methods
animals
trif-/-, tlr2-/- and tlr4-/- mice on a c57bl/ <dig> background  were originally generated by beutler and colleagues  <cit> , and used with their permission, but were generously supplied by dr. timothy bigby of ucsd. age-matched c57bl/6j control mice, and c57bl/6j:cb f <dig> hybrids for gene array analysis, were purchased from jackson laboratories . all experiments were performed according to nih guidelines and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the san diego va medical center. the mice were housed and maintained in accordance with nih policy for the human treatment of animal subjects.

bacteria
haemophilus influenzae  strain  <dig>  was streaked onto chocolate agar overnight. two colonies were picked and grown in  <dig> ml of brain heart infusion  media with  <dig> ml of fildes enrichment . the bacteria were spun down  and then resuspended to a final titer of  <dig> – 106/ml  <cit> .

surgery
trif-/- and c57bl/6j mice were divided into groups of  <dig> mice for each experimental time point . for dna microarrays,  <dig> c57bl/6j:cb f <dig> hybrid mice per time point were divided into two groups. all animals were inoculated with nthi as previously described  <cit> . briefly, the mice were deeply anesthetized, and both me bullae were accessed via a ventral midline incision in the neck. a hole was made in the bullae using the tip of a  <dig> gauge needle. both mes were injected with ~ <dig> μl of nthi inoculum, after which the incision was closed  <cit> . uninoculated  or sham injected  animals served as controls.

qpcr
expression of trif mrna during nthi-induced om was assessed in individual me mucosae from wild-type , tlr2-/- and tlr4-/- mice  by qpcr s previously described  <cit> . the me mucosae were dissected, mrna was extracted and reverse transcribed, and  <dig> μg/μl of cdna was amplified using commercial taqman qpcr primers  for trif  and myd <dig>  in an abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system . fold induction was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle  method  <cit> . relative expression of each target gene was normalized to levels of gapdh and compared to uninfected mucosa.

dna microarray
for each time point and condition , forty wt  me mucosae were harvested from deeply anesthetized mice at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours, as well as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after nthi inoculation. the tissue from  <dig> different mice was pooled, to generate two independent samples. the tissue was homogenized in trizol™  and total rna was extracted. total rna quality was assessed using the rna  <dig> labchip kit on the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer for the integrity of 18s and 28s ribosomal rna. the mrna was reverse transcribed using a t7-oligodt primer then in vitro transcribed using t <dig> rna polymerase to generate biotinylated crna probes that were hybridized to affymetrix mu <dig>  <dig>  microarrays. duplicate arrays were hybridized for each time point, using rna from pools of different mice to obtain an independent biological replication. raw intensity data was median normalized and statistical differences in gene transcript expression levels were evaluated using a variance-modeled posterior inference approach   <cit> . this program uses a bayesian approach to identify altered genes. statistical analysis by vampire requires two distinct steps:  modeling of the error structure of sample groups and  significance testing with a priori-defined significance thresholds. vampire models the existing error structure to distinguish signal from noise and identify the coefficients of expression-dependent and expression-independent variance. these models are then used to identify microarray features that are differentially expressed between treatment groups. this method allows the use of small numbers of replicates to evaluate gene expression across a continuum of conditions, down to one array per condition if  many samples are pooled for each array  and if multiple conditions are assessed. we used two arrays per condition, as recommended by the ucsd microarray core. we compared mice inoculated with nthi or pbs for each time point against uninjected  controls to generate sets of genes that change over time with nthi or pbs injection. we also compared mice inoculated with nthi versus pbs at each time point to generate sets of genes that are differentially regulated between the two conditions. bonferroni multiple testing correction  was applied to identify only those genes with the most robust changes. functional gene families were assessed by gene ontology  analysis, and specific genes were overlaid on pathways using genespring gx  <dig>  .

the ifnα's comprise a large family of highly similar genes, clustered on the same chromosome along with some pseudogenes, that are not well represented on the affymetrix mu <dig>  <dig>  microarray: affymetrix identifies two probes for ifnα <dig>  two for ifnα <dig>  three for ifnα <dig> and four for ifnα <dig>  however, for human affymetrix gene arrays, oligonucleotides for the ifnα family are reported to be incorrectly identified  <cit> . we therefore evaluated the ifnα probes present on the mu <dig>  <dig>  microarray by nblast against the mouse genome, and found similar problems with gene identification. several ifnα probes aligned to ifnα isoforms different from those specified by affymetrix, while other ifnα probes cross-aligned with several different ifnα's . we therefore considered only those probes that matched a single ifnα gene. probes were found to align uniquely to the ifnα <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, as well as to an unassigned ifnα gene similar to ifnα <dig> 

as a separate evaluation of ifn signaling, we assessed the expression of ifn-responsive genes that have been identified as preferentially activated by type i ifns  by baechler et al.  <cit> , choosing the  <dig> genes shown in their study to be most strongly up-regulated in leukocytes by ifnβ.

as a negative control, we assessed the expression of several genes whose est profiles on genbank show expression highly restricted to the testis, reasoning that these genes are highly unlikely to play a role in om: cyct ; tct <dig> ; dnajb <dig> ; adam <dig> ; tcp1b  and nkx2- <dig> . none of these genes showed significant changes during om.

as a positive control, we assessed genes reported in the literature to be strongly up-regulated in om. all were significantly regulated in om in the array data, at levels roughly similar to those previously reported: muc <dig>   <cit> ; muc5ac   <cit> ; muc5b   <cit> ; s100a <dig> , s100a <dig> , fth <dig>   <cit> .

histology
deeply anesthetized mice were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. mes were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> hours and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days post inoculation, processed and sectioned. sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin , and micrographs were digitally recorded. mucosal thickness and percent area of the me lumen occupied by inflammatory cells were measured at standardized areas of the me, and computer-averaged as described previously  <cit> .

bacterial clearance
bacterial presence was evaluated and analyzed from at least six wt, and trif-/- mes per time point, by obtaining a sample from each for nthi culture, as described previously  <cit> . briefly, a  <dig> μl culture loop was used to sample the me contents. if no fluid was present, the loop was used to scrape the me mucosa to recover any adherent bacteria. each loop was then used to separately streak four quadrants of a chocolate agar plate, which was incubated for  <dig> hours prior to evaluation of bacterial colonies. positivity was judged based upon the presence of multiple nthi colonies  on one or more quadrants of the plate. the presence of nthi was verified by gram staining of colony-forming units, and by negative cultures on blood agar plates versus chocolate agar plates.

statistics
except for gene array values as above, data were analyzed with anova using statview statistics software with bonferroni correction, as described elsewhere  <cit> . differences were considered significant at p ≤  <dig> .

RESULTS
trif expression is up-regulated in the me mucosa by nthi
we evaluated trif expression in the me mucosa of wt mice by qpcr . expression increased after administration of nthi, reaching approximately  <dig> -fold of that seen in the normal me by  <dig> days after inoculation, remained elevated for  <dig> days, and recovered to baseline by  <dig> days.

trif expression in the me is altered by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> deficiency
to evaluate trif expression in mice with a deficit in a major activator of myd <dig>  we assessed trif mrna expression in tlr2-deficient mice . since tlr <dig> can activate both myd <dig> and trif, we also measured trif mrna in tlr4-/- mice . trif expression in the absence of nthi was significantly greater in both knockout strains than in uninfected wt mice. upon infection with nthi, trif mrna decreased in these tlr deficient animals. within  <dig> hours, expression in the knockout and wt mice converged, and remained similar across the three strains over the course of  <dig> days.

trif signaling and type i ifn genes induced by nthi infection in the me mucosa
the expression of genes relevant to type i ifn and trif signaling in the me mucosa  was evaluated by gene array in c57bl/6j:cb mice . go analysis revealed that genes related to type i ifn signaling were significantly regulated during the course of om. in addition, individual genes encoding signaling molecules associated with trif showed up-regulation, which was greatest at  <dig> day after inoculation . type i ifn receptors were similarly up-regulated. in contrast, the expression of most type i ifns represented on the array showed relatively little change, with a modest tendency for down-regulation from  <dig> hours to  <dig> day after inoculation, and slight up-regulation at 2– <dig> days. an exception was an unassigned ifnα gene similar to ifnα <dig>  which was sharply up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> hours. . genes that are normally induced by type i ifns were very strongly up-regulated in the me mucosa in a biphasic manner; with peaks at  <dig> hours and at 2– <dig> days after inoculation . none of the genes that were differentially regulated by nthi were significantly altered in sham  mes.

trif-/- mice show reduced and delayed inflammatory response to nthi
to assess the functional influence of trif, we investigated the me response to nthi in trif-/- mice. wt mice demonstrated hyperplasia of the me mucosa, which reached a maximum thickness  <dig> days after inoculation with nthi . mucosal thickness remained elevated at  <dig> days, and then recovered to baseline by  <dig> days in wt mice. in trif-/- mice, there was a slightly greater thickness of the mucosa prior to nthi administration, compared to wt mice. however, the additional increase in mucosal thickness induced by nthi was more gradual, peaking at  <dig> days after inoculation, and recovered more slowly, not reaching baseline until 10– <dig> days. moreover, peak thickness was less than in wt mice.

the infiltration of leukocytes into the me lumen of wt mice  was minimal until  <dig> day after nthi inoculation, and like mucosal thickness, reached a maximum at  <dig> days. thereafter cellular infiltration decreased to reach baseline at  <dig> days. the infiltration of leukocytes in trif-/- animals was substantially reduced and delayed compared to wt animals. however, recovery to baseline had occurred by  <dig> days.

bacterial clearance is delayed in trif-/- mice
bacterial clearance of the me cavity was examined in trif-deficient mice and compared to that observed in wt mice . in wt mice,  <dig> out of  <dig>  culture plates were positive at  <dig> day, increasing to 6/ <dig> at  <dig> days, and decreasing to 3/ <dig> at  <dig> days. thereafter, no bacteria were recovered from wt mes. trif-/- mes were similar to wt mes for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after nthi administration, with 4/ <dig>  5/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> mes positive for bacterial colonization respectively. however, in contrast to wts, bacterial colonies could be still detected at  <dig> and  <dig> days, with  <dig> positive plate out of  <dig>  cultures were negative thereafter. by comparison, the mes of myd <dig> mice were strongly positive through  <dig> days   <cit> , and even at  <dig> days  1/ <dig> mes remained positive. tlr4-/- mes were culture-positive until  <dig> days.

discussion
in this investigation we found that biological processes mediated by trif activation contribute to the pathogenesis of nthi-induced om in mice. after nthi infection of wt mice the expression of trif, as well as of many trif-associated signaling genes and type i ifn-responsive genes, was up-regulated. moreover, animals deficient in trif exhibited altered om, consisting of delayed and reduced morphological signs of mucosal hyperplasia and inflammation as well as a delay in bacterial clearance.

as noted above, trif is recruited and activated following ligand binding to tlr <dig> and/or tlr <dig>  both of which are up-regulated in the me by exposure to nthi  <cit> . tlr <dig> is expressed by epithelial cells in the me mucosa, and also by infiltrating leukocytes  <cit> . while tlr <dig> has not been localized in the me, it is an intracellular receptor found on endosomal membranes of phagocytic and other cells  <cit> . moreover, nthi infection produces molecules that serve as ligands for these tlrs. lipooligosaccharide , with molecular structure closely related to lps, can activate cellular signals via tlr <dig>  <cit> . tlr <dig> is preferentially activated by double-stranded rna from viruses  <cit> , and this mode of stimulation would presumably not be involved in the response to nthi. however, bacterial rna is also able to activate tlr <dig>  <cit> . in addition, host molecules released during host cell injury or death can activate tlrs. tlr <dig> can respond to host mrna and dna  <cit>  while tlr <dig> can be activated by heat-shock proteins  <cit> , both of which are released during tissue injury as is known to occur in om . injection of tlr ligands, including lps, into the me mimics many of the pathologic changes observed in om, including mucosal inflammation and edema, me pressure abnormalities, and infiltrate of leukocytes into the subepithelial space and the me lumen  <cit> . thus substrates for trif activation are present in the me during om, and tlr activation independent of infection can contribute to its pathogenesis.

the dominant biological response to trif activation is type i ifn gene expression. the type i ifns can be produced by a variety of cell types, unlike the so-called immune ifns  that are produced primarily by t-cells  <cit> . type i ifn expression is induced by the activation of ikkε, tbk <dig> and irf <dig>  all of which we found to be significantly up-regulated in the me following nthi inoculation. irf <dig> activation in turn induces the expression of type i ifns and other genes containing isres  in their promoters, including a number of type i ifn-inducible genes  <cit> . the type i ifns are classically associated with response to viral infection. however, it has long been noted that exposure to bacteria can increase the expression of type i ifns and ifn-related genes , and that expression of ikkε, downstream from trif and upstream from irf <dig>  is enhanced by lps . bacterial induction of type i ifns is presumably related to their initial role in innate immunity and their later roles in dendritic cell, macrophage and t-cell activation. type i ifn-inducible genes have diverse functions related to inflammation and immunity, including cellular rna and protein metabolism, growth and differentiation, apoptosis and signal transduction  <cit> .

the production of type i ifns by peripheral blood leukocytes is reduced in individuals susceptible to upper respiratory infections  <cit> , including om  <cit> . moreover, type i ifns are pro-inflammatory and could contribute to om pathogenesis. in addition, type i ifn gene expression is known to make significant contributions to adaptive immunity, which could influence late responses to nthi. for example, type i ifns contribute to the maturation of dendritic cells  <cit> , the cross-priming of cd <dig> t-cells  <cit> , and the production of il- <dig>  <cit> . in the presence of tnfα, type i ifns can also facilitate the development of the pro-inflammatory th <dig> t-cell phenotype  <cit> . as a result, t-cells of both ifn-β deficient  <cit>  and ifn-α/β receptor-deficient mice  <cit>  show a less inflammatory, th <dig> bias. as noted above, trif can also be associated with the production of tnfα and interleukins via nfκb activation, albeit at a lower level and with delayed kinetics when compared to myd <dig> mediated processes.

our gene expression data support the idea that trif signaling is active during nthi-induced om. trif mrna was found by qpcr to increase during nthi-induced om. moreover, trif expression was up-regulated in uninfected mice deficient in either tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  possibly suggesting a compensatory change in tlr signaling. given that tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> can employ different signaling mechanisms , it is surprising that trif expression is so similar in the absence of either gene. however, we have previously shown  <cit>  that tlr <dig> is required for the early up-regulation of tlr <dig> induced by nthi, which may account for the similarity.

go analysis of gene array expression patterns during om identified type i ifn signaling as a pathway that is significantly regulated in the me by exposure to nthi. transcripts encoding most elements of the trif signaling cascade are also up-regulated, especially  <dig> hours after nthi inoculation. while most type i ifn genes were not extensively regulated during om, expression of at least some appears to be enhanced. this was especially true of a proposed ifnα gene similar to ifnα <dig>  which showed a sharp spike in fold expression within hours of nthi inoculation, but several ifn genes were mildly up-regulated later in om. finally, genes responsive to type i ifns are strongly up-regulated at 3– <dig> hours and again at 2– <dig> days after nthi inoculation.

the relatively low degree of regulation of type i ifn genes that we observed when upstream trif signaling and downstream ifn-regulated genes were more extensively up-regulated is puzzling. one possible explanation is the potential for regulation of ifnα genes that are not represented on the affymetrix mouse microarray. alternatively, increased trif signaling could bypass type ifns and interact directly with isres in the promoters of ifn-responsive genes. thus it can be speculated that the increased production of "ifnα similar to ifnα <dig> " which we observed immediately after nthi inoculation, or of an undocumented ifnα might mediate the initial response of type i ifn-inducible genes observed at 3– <dig> hours . however, many of these genes contain isres in their regulatory dna  <cit> , and so might be directly regulated by irf <dig>  the later peak in expression of type i ifn-inducible genes, at 2– <dig> days after inoculation, could again be mediated by the type i ifns themselves, by enhanced signaling through mildly up-regulated ifnα/β receptors and/or by direct regulation of isres  <cit>  through irf <dig> and other elements of the trif signaling cascade, which were up-regulated at  <dig> day. of course, an alternate potential source of type i ifn-related gene expression after nthi is activation of irf <dig> via myd <dig>  which can also induce the expression of type i ifns and ifn-inducible genes. this may be especially true for their expression later in om. while lack of myd <dig> has relatively little influence upon early om, it has a very strong influence upon late events  <cit> . however, the most compelling evidence for the involvement of trif signaling in om is the altered om phenotype observed in trif-/- mice, consisting of decreased initial inflammatory response to nthi, and delays in both mucosal recovery and bacterial clearance. these data suggest that trif contributes to both early and late events in om.

tlr <dig> is activated by endotoxins, including the los of nthi  <cit> , and therefore seems the most likely tlr to activate trif. we have shown previously  <cit>  that mice deficient in tlr <dig> show initial mucosal hyperplasia similar to that of wts, and demonstrate early leukocyte infiltration which exceeds that seen in wts but differ in expressing early defects in tlr <dig> and tnfα gene expression and in persistent hyperplasia and impaired bacterial clearance. since tlr <dig> can signal via the alternative adaptor myd <dig>  differences between the tlr4-/- and trif-/- phenotypes suggest that this tlr signals via both adaptors. finally, it has been suggested that additional pathogen receptors sensitive to bacterial molecules and using the trif adaptor may exist  <cit> .

in a previous study  <cit> , we found that in response to nthi, animals deficient in myd <dig> also initially develop mucosal hyperplasia and leukocyte infiltration of the me similar to wt mice. since both me mucosal hyperplasia and leukocyte infiltration are delayed in trif-deficient animals, it thus seems possible that initial me mucosal hyperplasia and leukocyte infiltration in response to nthi are mediated in part by signaling via trif. interestingly, despite the delayed and reduced leukocyte infiltration in trif-/- mice, these animals did clear nthi from the me, albeit with a delay. this suggests that the trif-deficient macrophages that enter the me may well be capable of efficient phagocytosis and bacterial killing. it should be noted that mucosal hyperplasia persisted longer in trif-/- mice than in wts, indicating a potential involvement of this adaptor protein in om recovery.

importantly, myd88-null animals show failure of om to resolve at  <dig> days post-inoculation and, indeed, higher levels of peak om at after wt animals have completely recovered  <cit> . they also showed failure to clear nthi from the me out to  <dig> days . these data suggest that myd <dig> may be more involved in the recovery of om than in the initiation of pathogenesis. in another study, we noted that tlr <dig>  which can signal via trif, was more involved in early om while tlr <dig>  which does not use trif, was more critical for recovery  <cit> . combined with the data from the present study, our results suggest that trif signaling may be more involved in immediate responses during nthi om than is myd <dig>  other investigators have noted that tlr <dig> responses to pathogens can occur earlier than those of tlr <dig>  <cit> . one reason for this may be the ability of tlr <dig> to signal via trif, and to induce the expression of type i ifns  <cit> , as well as via myd <dig>  the type i ifn pathway has been suggested to mediate the most immediate tlr responses to infection, followed by myd <dig> signaling inducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tnfα  <cit> .

the higher levels of trif mrna expressed in tlr2-/- and tlr4-/- mice in the absence of nthi exposure suggests that activity mediated through these receptors normally suppresses the expression of trif. this may be a specific and compensatory response to decreased signaling via myd <dig>  alternatively, increased pathogen loads in the me may be responsible for the increase in trif mrna. the enhancement of trif mrna observed in our qpcr data following nthi inoculation is consistent with the latter possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that trif signaling is important for an appropriate host response to nthi in the me, and to the relevance of tlrs in the response of humans to infection  <cit> . these findings underscore the complex interactions of tlrs acting via both myd88-dependent, and myd88-independent signaling pathways in the induction and resolution of nthi- induced om. they further suggest the potential importance of these innate immune pathway molecules and their pathways as targets for new treatments of this important human disease.
