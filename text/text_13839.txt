BACKGROUND
botulism is a paralytic disease caused by some of the most potent toxins known, the botulinum neurotoxins . the toxins are proteins mainly produced by the species clostridium botulinum but some clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii strains are also capable of producing bonts. due to their extreme potency, the bonts are classified as high risk threat agents for bioterrorism  <cit> . in addition to causing severe intoxications in humans, bont-producing bacteria can also produce serious problems in wild and domesticated animals such as birds, cattle, horses, sheep and minks. outbreaks with high mortal outcome in waterfowl and poultry have become an increasing environmental and economical problem  <cit> .

c. botulinum is an anaerobic, spore-forming gram-positive bacterium commonly found in soil and aquatic environments  <cit> . the species c. botulinum is divided into four physiological groups , which produce bonts of seven different serotypes   <cit> . the four groups represent distinct phylogenetic clades and are separated by a distance large enough to merit classification as four separate species  <cit> . physiological group i  includes c. botulinum strains producing toxins of serotype a, b or f and is mainly associated with human cases. physiological group ii  consists of strains producing toxins of serotype b, e or f; these strains also cause human botulism. group iii produces toxins of serotype c or d and is associated with avian and nonhuman mammalian botulism. genetic studies have shown that strains belonging to physiological group iii are more closely related to c. novyi and c. haemolyticum than to c. botulinum serotypes from group i and ii  <cit> . physiological group iv is a rarer and less characterised group that produces toxin of serotype g.

the neurotoxin genes of c. botulinum type c and d are carried by bacteriophages, which express unstable lysogeny and are frequently lost during cultivation. the bont prophage propagates in the bacterium as a large plasmid and strains cured from the phage can be reconverted to toxigenic strains by either type c or d phage particles  <cit> . the distinction between types c and d is not absolute because chimerical sequences exist  <cit> . in general, the neurotoxin genes analysed from avian isolates comprise parts from both bont/c and bont/d genes and are referred to as type c/d or d/c  <cit> . the chimeric types are more lethal to avian species than either type c or d  <cit> . c. botulinum types c and d also produce a minor amount of a binary toxin, the c <dig> toxin, which genes are located on a plasmid  <cit> . the c <dig> toxin has a translocation domain as well as an adp-ribosylating domain that targets actin.

several completed clostridia genomes have been reported in the last ten years, including c. difficile, c. perfringens, c. novyi-nt and c. botulinum types a, b, e and f  <cit> . the genome sizes of species in the clostridium genus vary between  <dig>  and up to at least  <dig> mb and their gc contents are often low. sequences from three large plasmids from c. botulinum group iii strains have been released: the bont prophage from strain c-stockholm  <cit> ; the c <dig> toxin plasmid from strains c203u <dig>  <cit>  and d-1873; and another large plasmid from strain d- <dig>  two draft whole genome shotgun  assemblies from type d strain  <dig> and type c strain eklund are also deposited in the sequence database.

here we report and analyse the first complete genomic sequence from a c. botulinum group iii strain. the sequence comes from a recently isolated c. botulinum type c/d strain originating in  <dig> from an outbreak in a swedish poultry farm. we also release three draft genomes: one from a wildfowl outbreak in  <dig>  another from a poultry outbreak in  <dig>  and finally the c-stockholm strain isolated from a mink outbreak in  <dig>  <cit> . the results have revealed a genome with a conserved core that is shaped by plasmids, phages and mobile elements.

RESULTS
general genome features
features and accession numbers of the replicons from the completed genome of the c. botulinum group iii strain 08-bkt <dig> and approximate data from the draft genomes of strains 07-v <dig> and c-stockholm  are presented in table  <dig>  data from the draft genome of strain 07-bkt <dig>  are not shown but were very similar to those for bkt <dig> with the exception that the bont prophage plasmid  was missing due to loss during cultivation. the table also includes features and accession numbers of the genomic sequence of the related c. novyi-nt strain  and all available completed c. botulinum group iii plasmids. in contrast to the previously completed plasmids originating from isolates before  <dig>  the bkt <dig> sequences came from a recent isolate . the c. botulinum group iii genome was comparably small in relation to other clostridium genomes with a circular chromosome of  <dig>  mbp and a low gc content. larger deviations of the gc content were only found in association with rrna operons . in addition to the chromosome, there were five circular plasmids in the bkt <dig> genome, with sizes varying between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb. a sixth plasmid of  <dig> kb was found in the draft genomes of v <dig> and c-stockholm. the plasmid sizes were also verified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  of s <dig> nuclease-treated genomic dna . the gc contents of all plasmids were similar to that of the chromosome and varied between  <dig> and 28%. a total of  <dig> coding sequences  were predicted in bkt <dig>  of which  <dig> were located on the chromosome and  <dig> on the plasmids. in total, 78% of the plasmid content and 86% of the chromosome consisted of cds. the genes were strongly clustered on the leading strand of the chromosome that was enriched in gs as seen by the gc skew plot . the largest plasmid, p <dig>  had a gc skew and a strand-biased distribution of genes similar to the chromosome, indicating two replichores of opposite polarity . in the second- and third-largest plasmids, p2bkt <dig>  and p3bkt <dig> , there was less difference in base composition between the strands and no strand-biased gene distribution was observed . the two smallest plasmids/prophages, p4bkt <dig>  and p5bkt <dig> , and the plasmid found in c-stockholm, p6cst , had most of their genes clustered on the same strand . putative functions were assigned to  <dig>  of the chromosomal cds and to  <dig>  of the cds in the total plasmidome. there is often a high number of rrna operons in clostridium species and the clostridium botulinum group iii genome was no exception. we identified  <dig> rrna operons and  <dig> trna genes. a noticeably large number of insertion sequence  elements were distributed throughout the genome on both replichores .

phylogenomic comparison
results from several methods show that the physiological groups of c. botulinum are so distant from each other that they could be considered to be different species  <cit> . rrna comparisons have also shown that c. novyi and c. haemolyticum are closely related to c. botulinum group iii  <cit> . we used the average similarity of the conserved core  method  <cit>  to compare the pairwise average nucleotide distance between the available completed and draft genomes from c. botulinum group iii and representative genomes from other c. botulinum groups and clostridium species . the distinct phylogenetic separation of the c. botulinum group i-iii was obvious. our results also unequivocally showed that the c. novyi-nt genome belongs to the same lineage as the c. botulinum c-eklund genome within c. botulinum group iii. this provides further evidence that the distinction between c. botulinum group iii and c. novyi does not have a phylogenomic basis. rather, the distinction has arisen from phenotypic traits linked to clinical symptoms. the c. botulinum group iii genome sequence contributes further evidence that the current bacterial species classification, at least for some lineages, is inadequate. on one hand, it would be impractical for clinical reasons to change the species name of the physiological groups, where all constituents are causing botulism. furthermore, it would be confusing to include strains that can cause completely different diseases within the group iii species. on the other hand, the current taxonomy conflicts with a phylogenetic concept of the species. we would therefore like to classify c. botulinum group iii as a dual species. the pathotypic species  c. botulinum would include all botulism-causing strains, while the genotypic species  c. novyi sensu lato would include c. botulinum group iii, c. novyi and c. haemolyticum.

upon comparing the available genomes of group iii strains, we found three different clades . our recently isolated strains formed one lineage, the d- <dig> and the c-stockholm strains formed a second one and the c -eklund  together with the c. novyi-nt strain formed a third lineage. the average genomic variation within group iii  was large, but not exceptionally so.

features of the chromosome
the isolates from  <dig> and  <dig> shared a 98-99% sequence similarity with each other on the nucleotide level in their core genomes, which account for 97-99% of the chromosome. overall, the bkt <dig> chromosome also showed a high resemblance to the c. novyi chromosome. the non-conserved regions between bkt <dig> and c. novyi were scattered throughout the sequence. the bkt <dig> chromosome was approximately 9% larger than that of c. novyi and the extra genetic material was relatively evenly distributed. using a blastp cut-off at e < 10e- <dig>   <dig> proteins were specific for c. novyi-nt and  <dig> were specific for bkt <dig> . hypothetical proteins and mobile element-related proteins constituted 58% and 8% of the bkt015925-specific proteins respectively. among the remaining proteins were components of a phosphotransferase system  and several large repeat-domain proteins. most toxin genes were located on the plasmids but there were two tetanolycin o genes found in the chromosome. these tetanolycin genes were also conserved in the c. novyi-nt genome. putative virulence-related genes in the chromosome and plasmidome are summarised in table  <dig>

bacterial genomes frequently undergo replication-directed translocations. when aligning closely related species these are seen by symmetric inversions around the replication origin  <cit> . there was a high conservation of gene synteny between the bkt <dig> and the c. novyi chromosomes and only a few symmetric inversions were visible . the degree of symmetrical inversions between two arbitrary genomes with this particular genetic distance varies tremendously. a few examples are shown in figure 3b. in conclusion, c. novyi sensu lato genomes show a comparably low replication-directed translocation activity.

features of the plasmidome
the five plasmids together comprised  <dig> % of the total genomic content of strain bkt <dig>  to date, this is the largest number of plasmids in any completed clostridia genome. in fact, in all the currently completed microbial genomes, less than 5% of them contain five or more plasmids. the copy number, as determined by coverage, was close to one for the bkt <dig> plasmids except for the smallest one, where it was approximately two. by mapping the draft genome reads onto the sequences of plasmids from bkt <dig>  we concluded that p1-p <dig> also were present and highly similar  in v <dig>  however, the p <dig> plasmid was absent. by pfge and analysis of de novo contigs unique to v <dig> and c-stockholm we could also detect the presence of a sixth plasmid of about  <dig> kb. this plasmid was completed using the c-stockholm genome sequence and was therefore called p6cst. we believe that the plasmids we present here are part of a pan-plasmidome existing in c. botulinum group iii. conjugative transfer of bont encoding plasmids has previously been reported between strains of c. botulinum, and it is likely this mechanism that is responsible for exchange of plasmids between strains  <cit> .

many of the plasmids contained phage genes and several toxin genes were present in the plasmidome . two of the plasmids also contained clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat  regions and genes encoding crispr-associated  proteins, providing acquired immunity against foreign dna  <cit> . typically, crispr regions are located on the chromosome and the c. novyi-nt genome is no exception with four chromosomal crispr regions. interestingly, crispr loci and cas genes were found exclusively on the plasmidome in bkt <dig>  the number and identity of the spacer sequences on p <dig> were identical to matches found in the other poultry strain, bkt <dig>  confirming that the two poultry strains are very closely related.

p1bkt015925
the largest extrachromosomal element, the bont-carrying prophage, was found to be a  <dig> kb circular plasmid in the bkt <dig> and v <dig> genomes. compared to the bont phage from the c-stockholm stain  <cit> , which has a size of  <dig> kb, the bkt <dig> phage contained 9% more genetic material. a comparison between p <dig> and phage c-stockholm is shown in figure 4a. the synteny of the conserved genetic material was well preserved. for this pair of plasmids, the average nucleotide similarity of the conserved core was in the same range as between the corresponding chromosomes . this indicates that the bont prophage and the chromosome are evolving under the influence of similar mechanisms and that they probably have co-existed for a period of time. if genetically diverged strains co-existed in the same habitat, loss of the bont prophage in combination with re-infection by one from another strain, could phylogenetically unlink the phage from the chromosome. our data does not support such scenario but more isolates need to be analysed before this hypothesis can be ruled out. the non-conserved regions, compared to the phage from c-stockholm, were evenly distributed throughout the replicon and consisted of  <dig> genes, of which 70% coded for hypothetical proteins, 6% for phage proteins and 8% for mobile elements. among the remaining proteins specific for p <dig> were proteins involved in prophage maintenance  and defence systems . three crispr regions, along with two cas genes, were found in p <dig>  containing  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> spacers. only two small crispr regions were present in phage c-stockholm, with  <dig> and  <dig> spacers. the majority of the  <dig> proteins specific for the c-stockholm phage were also hypothetical proteins , mobile elements  and phage proteins . phage c-stockholm and p <dig> specific proteins are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

the progenitor neurotoxin cluster in group iii strains consists of a regulatory protein , hemagglutinin  proteins and a non-toxic non-hemagglutinin  protein. these proteins are suggested to be involved in protection and transportation of the neurotoxin  <cit> . the complete gene cluster was found in p <dig>  together with the mosaic neurotoxin gene coding for the c-type light -chain and the c/d chimerical heavy -chain. the l-chain  showed a 98% sequence identity with the corresponding residues in c-stockholm, but only 48% identity for the same region in type d- <dig>  by contrast, the c-terminal part of the h-chain  shared 42% sequence identity with phage c-stockholm, but 95% to d- <dig>  the n terminal part of the h-chain gene showed high similarity to both c and d types and was probably the place where the recombination event once occurred.

p2bkt015925
the second-largest plasmid was nearly  <dig> kb. an interesting feature found in it was an alpha-toxin with conserved domains of the aerolysin superfamily. it showed highest similarity to the alpha-toxin of c. septicum, which has both necrotic and haemolytic properties  <cit> . another interesting feature was a homologue to the gene coding for clostripain, which was found downstream of the alpha-toxin. this type of cysteine endopeptidase has been found in many clostridia, for example in c. novyi and c. botulinum group i genomes, but in those cases it was located on the chromosome. the α-clostripain from c. perfringens has been suggested to be involved in pathogenesis  <cit> . two genes coding for metallo-beta lactamases and one for penicillin amidase were also found in this plasmid; these may contribute to resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. three crispr regions were found, consisting of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> spacers. we also identified three cas proteins  in proximity to the crispr loci.

we compared the p <dig> plasmid to other group iii plasmids . some conserved regions were present, especially in the pclg <dig> plasmids from c. botulinum type d strain  <dig>  interestingly, two large, conserved blocks contained all putative virulence factors , two of the cas genes, and the penicillin amidase gene. small, scattered, and conserved regions were also shared with pc2c203u <dig>  and p <dig>  indicating that genetic crossover events have occurred. this is in contrast to the chromosome and bont phage where rearrangements have been few.

p3bkt015925
among the more interesting features of this  <dig> kb plasmid were two genes coding for putative lantibiotic abc transporters, and the two genes coding for c <dig> toxin. interestingly, the two c <dig> toxin genes were also found on plasmid pc2c203u <dig> , which otherwise shared little resemblance with the p <dig> plasmid . the amino-acid sequence of the c2i component shared 96% sequence identity with that of plasmids c-203u <dig> and pclg <dig> and 100% with the c2i sequence of c. botulinum strain   <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the c2ii component was more diverged compared to strains  <dig> and c-203u <dig> . the c-terminal extension found in strain  <dig> was also missing. consistent with previous observations  <cit> , the divergence in the c-terminus of the c2ii sequence contributed to most of the differences in sequence identity.

p4bkt015925
the majority of the coding sequences in this  <dig> kb plasmid were phage related, suggesting that this is a prophage. however, it also contained genes coding for plasmid segregation and replication. interestingly, the gc content and gc skew were different for the prophage and the plasmid-replication part. this could indicate that the prophage may have hijacked a plasmid-replication system.

p5bkt015925
the smallest of the plasmids , found only in the poultry isolates, contained two putative epsilon type b toxins. the sequence identity between the two toxin genes was quite low . a putative homologue was also found in the pclg <dig> plasmid but the conservation was low there as well. two cds were phage related and all genes but one were located on the same strand. interestingly, this was a repressor-coding gene that might regulate the transcription of the opposite, gene-dense, strand.

p6cst
among the cds identified in this  <dig> kb plasmid found in c-stockholm , eleven were phage related, suggesting that it is a prophage as well. other genes of interest were two for penicillin amidase and one for a bacteriocin. the latter possibly inhibits growth of competing bacterial strains. all cds, except for four, were located on the same strand.

transposon activity
it has been found that mobile element abundance in clostridia varies between species and between strains within the same species  <cit> . in the c. botulinum group iii genome bkt <dig>  many mobile elements were found and some types were present in a high-copy number indicating that the genome is influenced by high transposon activity. to also compare the transposon distribution in the draft genomes , we mapped reads spanning the insertion points of the elements onto an in silico created transposon-free chromosome. the two poultry isolates bkt <dig> and bkt <dig> had an identical transposon insertion pattern . by contrast, the wildfowl isolate v <dig> had a very different distribution of transposons in its genome . it remains unknown if these elements have moved sporadically during a longer time or if there has been a massive burst of relocations. an overview of the mobile elements present in the chromosomes of bkt <dig> and v <dig> compared to c. novyi-nt are presented in table  <dig> 

included among the high-copy mobile elements that showed an elevated transposon activity, there were elements related to the is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> families. there was also a trans-located cassette of two, tandem reverse-transcriptase  genes. in total, the mobile elements accounted for  <dig> % of the genetic content of the bkt <dig> chromosome and tended to be placed in non-coding regions of both replichores . except for the is21-related element, the mobile elements were inserted in intergenic regions, thereby avoiding gene disruptions. is elements were also found on the three largest plasmids. two types of elements belonging to the is200/is <dig> family were found exclusively in the plasmidome. in fact, the density of mobile elements was highest on p <dig> and p <dig>  where  <dig> and 12% respectively of the total genetic content constituted of such elements. this was interesting because these two plasmids seem to be more genetically dynamic than the chromosome and p <dig> plasmid. the exchange of plasmids between strains further increases the possibility of horizontal gene transfer facilitated by is elements.

the is <dig> element, iscbo <dig>  was most related to an is element, iscpe <dig>  found in c. perfringens. the iscbo <dig> elements were found in  <dig> places  in the bkt <dig> chromosome, of which only eight were on the same place in the v <dig> draft genome . iscbo <dig> elements were also found on p <dig> and p <dig>  in most cases, the elements were located directly upstream a gene and were surrounded by 8-9-bp non-conserved, direct repeats flanking a 10-bp inverted repeat . although these elements were not found on the bont-carrying prophage in bkt <dig>  they had previously been identified in a truncated form, between orfx and botr in the bont cluster of c. botulinum group i strains. it has been suggested that these elements, together with other closely located transposons, have been the responsible machinery causing horizontal transfer of the bont cluster between strains of c. botulinum  <cit> .

the is21-related element, iscbo <dig>  consisted of two adjacent genes, integrase and istb. this element was also found in the c. beijerickii ncimb  <dig> genome. istb has an atp-binding motif, and is thought to be involved in facilitating the contact between target dna and a transposase, in this case an integrase  <cit> . the iscbo <dig> element was found on six positions on the chromosome of bkt <dig>  and was also present on the three largest plasmids. it showed a tendency to be incorporated into another mobile element, a tandem reverse-transcriptase , thereby disrupting its structure. the incorporations were not at the same positions within the rt gene. small remnants of the iscbo <dig> element were found at several places in the genome which could be a consequence of iscbo <dig> insertions.

the is <dig> family element, iscbo <dig>  found in the c. botulinum group iii genome showed high amino-acid sequence similarity  to iscpe <dig> found in c. perfringens. the iscbo <dig> element was identified on five locations on the bkt <dig> chromosome and on p1-p <dig>  the insertion pattern in v <dig> was quite different from that in bkt <dig> . the element was also found on one location in the c. novyi-nt genome.

the is <dig> element iscbo <dig> was previously identified  in numerous copies in the genome of c. novyi-nt and burkholderia pseudomallei/b. mallei strains   <cit> . seventeen copies  of this element were located on the bkt <dig> chromosome, while only twelve copies were found in v <dig>  six of the copies in v <dig> were found on the corresponding loci in bkt <dig>  however, in some cases the insertion sites were slightly altered, which indicates that they have once left and then been reinserted in the same position. there was only one copy within the plasmidome . all insertion sites except one were composed of inverted repeats forming a hairpin structure. the hairpin structures were exclusively located at the end of genes and most likely act as transcription stop signals. the iscbo <dig> element without a surrounding hairpin seems to indicate that it is transcribed together with the upstream gene. it has previously been suggested that such an element is the ancestral one  <cit> . this specific iscbo <dig> element was also broken, indicating it might not be tolerated by the host. the equivalent element  in the c. novyi-nt genome was located next to a resolvase gene, but in strain bkt <dig> it was next to a cysteine desulfurase gene. to test the hypothesis that it is a fused transcript, we amplified the mrna of the cysteine desulfurase gene by rt-pcr. the gene was transcribed but was not fused with iscbo <dig> .

seven different elements belonging to the is200/is <dig> family  were found in p <dig>  and one in p <dig> , where five of the is <dig> elements were located autonomously and two were found adjacent to is <dig> elements. iscbo <dig> existed in two copies, both autonomously and adjacent to iscbo <dig>  interestingly, this class of elements was only found in the plasmidome. one of the is200/is <dig> elements was highly conserved in the phage c-stockholm  but it was not located at the same position. by comparing flanking sequences, we located all is200/is <dig> elements to the same positions in the v <dig> genome, suggesting that these elements are less active than the previously discussed ones.

CONCLUSIONS
the completion of the genome of c. botulinum group iii has revealed a relatively small chromosome indicating a low tolerance for redundant or excessive genetic material. acceptance for genes on the lagging strand was also low indicating that high transcription efficiency is crucial for this organism. although there was a low tendency for rearrangements in the chromosome, size variation between strains indicated that there is an on-going insertion and removal of genetic material. it is probable that the abundant mobile elements are contributing to the genome remodelling process. the c. botulinum group iii is genetically remote from the types that can cause human botulism, but closely related to c. novyi. there are larger differences between certain pairs of c. botulinum group iii strains than between some group iii strains and c. novyi. on the basis of these facts, and in analogy with the handling of the bacillus cereus group, we propose a new genotypic name , c. novyi sensu lato, for c. botulinum group iii, c. novyi and c. haemolyticum. however, it is unlikely that the pathotypic name  is going to be changed from c. botulinum.

in contrast to the conserved chromosome, we discovered that physiological group iii has a remarkably large and variable plasmidome where closely related isolates can have different sets of plasmids. the largest plasmid, the bont phage, seemed to obey the same evolutionary rules as the chromosome. in the medium-sized plasmids, and to some extent in the smaller ones, genetic material had been rearranged at a much higher rate and with fewer constrictions. we hypothesise that these plasmids are part of a larger pan-plasmidome and that strains can exchange plasmids.

mobile elements were abundant also within the plasmidome, where the medium-sized plasmids had the highest transposon density, and they may have been contributing to the mechanism of rearrangements. interestingly, five out of six toxin types found within the c. botulinum group iii genome were located in the plasmidome. our results suggest a model for genome evolution where a conserved core is located in the chromosome while factors affecting pathogenicity are located on a more plastic plasmidome to allow faster environmental adaption without disturbing core functions.
