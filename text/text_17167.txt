BACKGROUND
cytochrome c oxidase  is a multimeric enzyme that is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes, belongs to the terminal enzymatic complex  of the respiratory chain and facilitates the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen  <cit> . the three mitochondrially-encoded subunits of cox  typically possess conserved primary and secondary structures, including a relatively invariant number of transmembrane helices  per subunit  <cit> , with cox <dig> and cox <dig> containing highly conserved catalytic sites. unique among the mtdna-encoded cox subunits, cox <dig> has two n-terminus tmhs embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane while the c-terminus half of the protein, containing the cua center catalytic site, is located in the intermembrane space. these two distinct regions of cox <dig> are referred to as the cox2_tm and cox <dig> pfam domains, respectively. most mitochondrial protein coding genes have been shown to evolve under purifying selection  <cit> . however, a few recent studies have detected a signature of positive selection in cox <dig> lineages and/or sites  <cit> . nevertheless, the typically conserved pattern of cox <dig> domains is violated in one category of animal mitochondrial genomes, namely those paternally transmitted in unionoidean bivalves.

freshwater unionoidean bivalves, as well as representatives of two marine bivalve orders , exhibit doubly uniparental inheritance  of mtdna, which involves distinct maternal  and paternal  transmission routes concomitant with highly divergent gender-associated mtdna genomes  <cit> . for a general review of dui, see  <cit> . female bivalves transmit their mitochondria  to sons and daughters, as in standard maternal inheritance, but males are believed to effectively transmit their mitochondria  to only sons . in the latter, f mtdna predominates in the somatic tissues while principally m mtdna is found in the testes. thus, this genetic system yields homoplasmic female and heteroplasmic male individuals. intra- and inter-specific comparisons suggest that the m genome is evolving more rapidly than the f genome  <cit> . the f and m mitochondrial genomes of unionoidean bivalves form reciprocally monophyletic groups  <cit> , are highly divergent  <cit>  and fossil evidence suggests that the f/m divergence occurred > <dig> mya  <cit> .

recent studies revealed that cox <dig> from the male-transmitted genomes of unionoidean bivalves has a 3' coding extension that typically yields an ~80% increase in gene length relative to the female-transmitted cox <dig> genes  <cit> . because of the pattern of nucleotide substitution and evidence of transcription, it was hypothesized that the mcox <dig> extension  is functional, rapidly evolving and subject to relaxed purging selection  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the extended mcox <dig> gene is translated, most heavily expressed in testes and the protein product is localized to sperm mitochondria  <cit> . these findings are consistent with the predictions of a male-transmission route for the m genome and functional significance of the extended mcox <dig> gene. furthermore, a secondary structure analysis indicated that the mcox2e domain has multiple transmembrane helices  which suggests a membrane-bound location for this region  <cit> . these previous studies indicate that the cox <dig> protein coded by unionoidean bivalve m genomes has a novel third domain  at its c-terminus.

to obtain further insights into the molecular patterns of primary and secondary structure evolution, and the processes directing these changes, we compared patterns of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in mcox2e with those in the other portions of the cox <dig> and cox <dig> gene junction region  from both the f and m genomes among  <dig> unionoidean bivalve species . our molecular sequence analyses of the mcox2e region indicate  relatively high rates of primary and secondary structure evolution,  potential instances of site-specific positive selection and  an overall pattern of purifying selection leading to the preservation of the tmh/ihl and c-terminus tail sub-regions of mcox2e. the pattern of amino acid substitutions indicated that, despite the relatively high degree of sequence divergence observed in some cases, most of the changes did not drastically alter the biochemical properties of the involved amino acid sites. therefore, the general structure of the mcox2e region has been preserved since these sequences diverged from a common ancestor >  <dig> mya.

RESULTS
in the  <dig> bivalve species examined, we obtained comparable sequences of the following lengths:  <dig> bp of fcox <dig>   <dig> bp of fcox <dig>   <dig> bp of mcox <dig>  and  <dig> bp of mcox2h . mcox2e ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp in length . the mcox2e region contains indels within nucleotide positions 7– <dig>  the first six nucleotides and those from position 136– <dig> aligned unambiguously and were used in alignment-based analyses containing mcox2e, while those from positions 7– <dig> were removed prior to all alignment-based analyses. thus, slight length variation occurred either within the first  <dig> amino acid positions, or at the c-terminus end . no indels were observed between amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> , and  <dig> constant amino acid positions were observed . pairwise amino acid and nucleotide distances  are given in additional file  <dig>  the average corrected amino acid and nucleotide distances were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the mcox2h+cox <dig> region,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the fcox2+cox <dig> region, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the mcox2e region.

database searching
tblastx searches of the ncbi database failed to find sequences with significant similarity to the newly characterized mcox <dig> extensions. even when a relaxed search was conducted , no significant matches were found outside of mitochondrial genomes from unionoidean bivalves, indicating that this extension is indeed a unique feature of the m mitochondrial genomes of these animals  <cit> . likewise, psi-blast  <cit>  searches using the deduced amino acid sequences of mcox2e resulted in convergence  being achieved at the 3rd iteration, and no additional homologs outside of those described above were identified.

a search of the pfam database  for entries whose architecture contains the cox <dig> domain results in  <dig> sequences, of which  <dig> are eukaryotic . most of the remaining  <dig> sequences  exhibit an architecture with a conserved transmembrane domain  5' of the cox <dig> domain. a cox2_tm domain is identified for  <dig> sequences but the model's significance is below the threshold for inclusion in the sequence architecture. approximately 97%  of the remaining  <dig> sequences are incomplete with less than  <dig> residues upstream of the cox <dig> domain, leaving  <dig> sequences with greater than  <dig> residues upstream of cox <dig> and no predicted cox2_tm domain. we analyzed these sequences with the tmh prediction algorithm conpred ii and identified for  <dig> sequences two tmhs 5' of the cox <dig> domain. the cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii locus is duplicated in the f genome of the bivalve venerupis phillipinarium and one copy lacks any 5' tmhs , but a cox2_tm domain is present in the second copy. the remaining  <dig> sequences consist of species from the taxa alveolata and viridiplantae and do not exhibit upstream thms when examined with conpred ii.

in contrast,  <dig>  of the  <dig> eukaryotic sequences contain tmhs downstream of the cox <dig> domain. this result is not an artifact of the large number of incomplete sequences in the pfam database as only two  of the  <dig> complete eukaryotic cox <dig> sequences have tmhs 3' of the cox <dig> domain. these  <dig> sequences have between one and five tmhs and are all from the male-transmitted, mitochondrial genomes of unionoidean bivalves and represent the previously identified mcox2e region  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses
the majority rule consensus tree from the bayesian analysis of the concatenated m and fcox2-cox <dig> nucleotide sequences  using gtr+g+i is shown in figure  <dig>  a bayesian analysis that omitted mcox2e  produced essentially the same results, the only difference being a three-clade polytomy near the root that was resolved in figure  <dig>  the species relationships indicated by our gene phylogeny  are very similar to those displayed in the most comprehensive published study of amblemine bivalve phylogeny  <cit>  but our figure  <dig> displays generally higher nodal support values.

transmembrane helix  prediction and tree-based tmh number optimization
the number and positions of the predicted mcox2e tmhs are shown in a phylogenetic context in figure  <dig> with the number of tmhs ranging from three to five. two tmh gain events and two tmh loss events are suggested from an examination of character state transitions of nodes with significant ancestral character state reconstructions . when considering the inclusion or omission of the mcox2e region in our phylogenetic analyses, the estimation of ancestral tmh number by ml optimization did not change for the nodes that were significant in figure  <dig>  all tree topology constraint analyses rejected the hypothesis of monophyly for each of the three groups of sequences possessing the same number of predicted tmhs . in addition to the indicated multiple changes in the number of tmhs, figure  <dig> also suggests that the lengths of mcox2e's interhelical loop regions can change without an associated tmh number transition .

properties of the data:  conservation of mcox2e sequences
collectively, the  <dig> mcox <dig> extensions display  <dig> constant amino acid positions , which is a significantly greater number than that expected by chance . of the  <dig> data-sets  simulated using the conservative mtrev <dig> model of substitution, only  <dig> % had  <dig> or greater constant amino acid positions. using the less conservative poisson model of substitution, 97% of sequences do not have any conserved positions and the remaining 3% had either only  <dig> or  <dig> conserved positions. within the bounds of these constant positions, no indels are required for the alignment of a contiguous block of  <dig> amino acids, but slight length variation is observed outside of the y <dig> and y <dig> positions . the n- and c-termini of each of the  <dig> extensions is relatively hydrophilic while the interior ~2/ <dig> is relatively hydrophobic . the predicted c-terminus tail sub-region  is generally more conserved in its primary structure than is the n-terminus/tmh/ihl sub-region of the extensions , and contains conserved n-glycosylation  and casein kinase ii phosphorylation motifs  .

properties of the data:  estimates of amino acid substitution rates and positive selection
the hypervariability of the mcox <dig> extensions is confirmed by a sliding-window plot  which illustrates that the overall amino acid substitution rate in the extension is approximately six times greater than that of the mcox2h+mcox <dig> region, and more than  <dig> times greater than the fcox2+fcox <dig> region. these are likely to be conservative estimates because the most variable portion of the mcox2e region  was omitted from this analysis. the substitution rate is especially high in the relatively hydrophobic region containing the tmhs and ihls . even though the relatively hydrophilic c-terminus tail region is the most conserved portion of the extension, the substitution rate in this region is at least double that of any portion of the mcox2h+mcox <dig> region and at least three times greater than any portion of the fcox2+fcox <dig> region.

codeml  and hyphy  analyses of site-specific positive selection identified six and eight  of the  <dig> unambiguously alignable mcox2e amino acid positions  as potential targets of positive selection  . however, we should note that different sites were identified by different methods; interestingly, sites identified by different approaches are located close to each other, almost adjacent, in the overall amino acid sequence. further, none of the individual sites have passed the stringent criterion of being statistically significant at 95% or higher level , although one site in each analysis passed a less stringent criterion of > 90% confidence . these analyses are suggestive that there is positive selection operating on specific sites in mcox2e. therefore, we propose that one or more of these sites may be of potential interest for future studies of mcox2e, so we are reporting all of the sites with a hyphy bayes factor >  <dig> or a codeml pp >  <dig>  the log-likelihood values and parameter estimates for the four codeml models applied to the m and f cox2+cox <dig> regions are displayed in additional file  <dig>  in contrast, none of the mcox2h+mcox <dig> or fcox2+fcox <dig> amino acid positions  displayed evidence of diversifying selection using either method. each of these  <dig> amino acid positions in mcox2e suggested as potential targets of diversifying selection represent a site where there is interspecific variation for the constituent amino acids residing in a predicted helix vs. inter-helical loop structure . overall, these results suggest the possibility of positive selection driving the sequence changes at particular individual sites, although further experimental studies are needed to determine functional significance of these sites.

properties of the data:  changes in amino acid composition and properties
because nucleotide composition can  influence the amino acid content , we compared the overall amino acid composition of mcox2e to that of the f and m cox counterparts to see whether they differ. overall amino acid composition was found to be essentially the same between fcox2+cox <dig> and mcox2h+cox <dig> gene regions . amino acid composition of mcox2e differs significantly from that observed in fcox2-cox <dig> and mcox2h-cox <dig> , primarily due to significantly lower gc-rich codon content. the proportion of at-rich or neutral codons were not significantly different between the three regions.

the treesaap evaluation of physicochemical changes of  <dig> amino acid properties for the three gene regions  are given in additional file  <dig>  following  <cit> , we concentrate on six amino acid properties shown to be correlated with rates of amino acid substitutions: composition of the side chain, polarity, molecular volume, polar requirements, hydropathy, and isoelectric point . we also considered alpha-helical properties and turn tendencies, which could affect the formation of tmhs. the hypervariability of mcox2e is confirmed by both primary and secondary structure analyses . however, the treesaap results indicated that very similar patterns of amino acid substitution exist between the three gene regions, i.e., most amino acid properties are subject to purifying selection on destabilizing changes. of the  <dig> properties examined,  <dig>  showed statistically significant signs of purifying selection for the mcox2h+mcox <dig> region, as compared to  <dig>  for mcox2e, and  <dig>  for the fcox2+fcox <dig> region. only two properties  showed statistically significant signs of positive selection, and only in the fcox2+fcox <dig> region . interestingly, similar trends were detected when only the mcox2e sequences were considered, although to a somewhat lesser extent , indicating that purifying selection plays a role in shaping the amino acid composition of mcox2e. in particular, such properties as beta-structure tendencies, helical contact area, polarity and polar requirements, among others, were found to have a significantly smaller number of observed than expected amino acid substitutions . moreover, two properties related to the formation of transmembrane helices were either neutral in all three regions or under purifying selection.

the six "most important" treesaap categories according to  <cit> . two additional properties  are given due to their potential importance to transmembrane helix formation. absence of selection means neutrality.

discussion
the mcox2e region is unique to unionoidean bivalve m genomes
our tblastx, psi-blast and pfam database searches failed to find any significant matches between the new mcox2e/mcox2e sequences analyzed herein and any non-m genome sequences in the current sequence databases. the multiple similarities among the  <dig> mcox2e sequences analyzed herein are consistent with the hypothesis that the mcox2e region was acquired in a single insertion event that took place in a distant common ancestor that lived >  <dig> mya  <cit> , rather than by accretionary acquisition. furthermore, mcox2e was found in representatives of the genus margaritifera  <cit> , the hypothesized basal unionoid bivalve lineage  <cit> , indicating an origin for the mcox2e region ≥  <dig> mya. unfortunately, the original source of the dna now comprising the mcox2e region may remain unidentified given the extremely high substitution rate in this region and the relatively large amount of time over which this region has accumulated substitutions.

another feature novel to unionoidean bivalve m genomes is the presence of the tmh/ihl sub-region of mcox2e downstream of the cox <dig> domain. we have shown in the sequences analyzed herein, that there are between three and five such tmhs, and that there has been a minimum of four changes in tmh number  during the evolution of mcox2e  in the  <dig> amblemine bivalve species analyzed herein. furthermore, in  <dig> of the  <dig> c-terminus tail sub-regions of mcox2e, both n-glycoslylation and casein kinase ii phosphorylation motifs are observed  along with this subregion being more conserved in primary structure than the tmh/ihl sub-region . thus, while mcox2e appears volatile with respect to primary structure and the number and position of tmhs/ihls, purifying selection  is apparently acting to preserve the general character of the tmh/ihl and c-terminus tail sub-regions of this unique region.

is the mcox2e region functional?
in a study of four freshwater mussel species'  mcox <dig> extensions, curole and kocher  <cit>  concluded that the "...extension is protein-coding and functional." their claim was based on three factors:  the extension is in frame for each mcox <dig> gene and the stop codon is located just upstream of the putative cox <dig> initiation codon,  the relative rates of nucleotide substitution among the three codon positions in the extension are typical for protein coding loci and  a polyadenylated transcript of the mcox <dig> gene, containing the extension, was detected in testes. subsequently, chakrabarti et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that mcox2e is translated and strongly expressed in testes and sperm mitochondria  and they hypothesized "...the c-terminus extension has functional significance for male unionoidean bivalve reproductive success." our study strongly supports the hypothesis of functionality for the mcox2e region because the  <dig> extension sequences in this report  are in reading frame with the homologous portion of cox <dig> and have a 3' stop codon near their putative cox <dig> initiation codon,  show typical relative rates of substitution among the three codon positions,  have  <dig> constant amino acid positions, a number greater than expected by chance, juxtaposed within a relatively larger number of amino acid sites with extremely elevated substitution rates,  have at least three predicted transmembrane helices,  have conserved functional motifs in the c-terminus tail sub-region,  have amino acid compositions indicative of a putative functional state and one that is quite similar to that of the mcox2h+mcox <dig> and fcox2+fcox <dig> regions,  have generally conserved hydropathy plots and  are evolving largely under the influence of purifying selection , but may potentially be influenced by positive selection at ~10% of sites .

the observed conservation of general mcox2e features could be due to  purifying selection acting on the mcox2e region per se or  purifying selection acting to maintain an ancestral sequestration of the extension so as to prevent it from interfering with vital mitochondrial functions. because mcox <dig> is found in two sub-cellular locations  vs. the single ancestral location  seems to rule out the second hypothesis. thus, it is likely that purifying selection is maintaining the general characteristics of a functional mcox2e region in the face of an extremely high overall amino acid substitution rate. this hypothesis is bolstered by the observation that, similar to the mcox2h+mcox <dig> and fcox2+fcox <dig> regions, two amino acid properties related to transmembrane helix formation  were found to be evolving under either neutral or purifying selection acting to preserve the physicochemical properties of mcox2e.

within the extension region bounded by the y <dig> and y <dig> conserved amino acid positions , the juxtaposition of hypervariability and conservation is consistent with the hypothesis that the predicted tmh number and position variability is due to substitution-based processes rather than the typically implicated duplication/deletion events . this hypothesis is supported by "mutating" the mcox2e sequences in members of sister taxon pairs that have different numbers of estimated helices , and subsequently employing conpred ii to estimate helix number for the "mutated" sequences. for example, when comparing the pleurobema and fusconaia mcox2e sequences, changing the amino acid at position  <dig>  of fusconaia's mcox2e to that in pleurobema  resulted in the gain of a 5th helix in fusconaia's mcox2e which was in the same position as the 5th helix in pleurobema. similarly, a single amino acid substitution  in lemiox's mcox2e sequence resulted in the gain of a 5th helix in lemiox which is in the same position as the 3rd helix in ptychobranchus mcox2e . thus, a single amino acid substitution in mcox2e can be sufficient to transform an interhelical loop sub-region into a tmh. furthermore, the suggestion of positively selected sites in the areas of mcox2e in which some species contain tmhs and others do not  coupled with the possibility of single amino acid substitutions resulting in a change in tmh number, could help explain the volatility in tmh number and position inferred from our mcox2e sequences. the above results suggest that while the preservation of the tmh/ihl and c-terminus tail subregions is a general feature of mcox2e evolution, the specific number and positions of tmhs are readily changed.

there are other known genes that exhibit a similar pattern of being composed of a mixture of highly variable and more conserved sites. for example, in mammalian genes of the major histocompatibility complex , the highly variable antigen recognition sites are subject to strong positive selection  <cit>  while other sites evolve under purifying selection. likewise, different regions of the gamete-recognition protein bindin in sea urchins exhibit signs of both positive and purifying selection  <cit> . moreover, the substitution patterns observed within mcox2e are inconsistent with it being a pseudogene. generally, pseudogenes experience a relaxation of selection and are gradually degraded through the accumulation of random substitutions  <cit> . while some pseudogenes appear to be relatively conserved , they are unlikely to persist for many millions of years, as is the case with mcox2e which is shared among taxa that diverged ≥  <dig> mya  <cit> . moreover, overall amino acid composition of mcox2e is quite similar to that of the homologous cox genes analyzed herein , with the exception of gc-rich codons. however, because the composition of pseudogenes has been shown to strongly correlate with the overall at composition of the genome  <cit> , similarity of at-rich and neutral codons' content between mcox2e and the other cox regions may serve as additional evidence indicating a functional role for mcox2e.

significance of rapid evolutionary rate for a functional mcox2e region?
both the primary and secondary structures of the mcox2e region are evolving much faster than in the mcox2h+mcox <dig> and fcox2+fcox <dig> regions. the amino acid substitution rate in the mcox2e region is ~6× faster than that in the mcox2h+mcox <dig> gene junction region and >20× faster than that in the f gene junction region . tmh number in the mcox2e region is evolving much faster than in the typical tm domains of cox proteins  which generally show no tmh number variation over more than  <dig> million years of divergence . furthermore, secondary structure analyses of the two complete mcox <dig> sequences available in the genbank  confirm the presence of two tmhs near the n-terminus of the protein . the extremely rapid evolution in both primary and secondary structure of the mcox2e region relative to the other domains of the f and m cox2-cox <dig> gene junction regions, along with the multiple sub-cellular locations of mcox <dig> in sperm mitochondria  <cit> , suggest that mcox2e has a unique function and consequently a selective regime that is distinct from that of the other mtdna protein coding domains. the male-specific transmission of m genomes , the testes-biased tissue distribution of mcox <dig>  <cit> , predominant expression of mcox <dig> in testes tissue  <cit> , and mcox <dig> maximal expression immediately prior to fertilization  <cit>  are all consistent with the hypothesis of a reproductive function for m genomes  <cit> . relatively rapid rates of evolution are frequently observed for proteins involved in reproduction . thus, the rapid evolution of primary and secondary structure in mcox2e, combined with the action of purifying and possibly site-specific positive selection on this unique domain, provide additional evidence for the reproductive function hypothesis.

given the published evidence supporting the hypothesis that mcox <dig> is localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane of sperm  <cit> , the ihls and/or c-terminus tail of mcox2e may serve to "tag" paternal mitochondria in early embryos to facilitate their gender-specific movement  <cit>  which is likely a requisite for the maintenance of paternal mitochondria transmission. the impact of positive selection on just a few amino acid sites in the tmh/interhelical loop region of mcox2e could have a propagating effect on protein function  by shifting the actual sequence of amino acids that are in the loops . positive selection at just a few sites could:  lead to switches in the signaling pathway from one to another  and/or  diversify the pathway by adding extra recognition sites . whenever a helix changes position, so does the size and amino acid composition of the two adjacent interhelical loops. a change in helix position could cause a change in the  loop sequence, even though the overall amino acid sequence in the protein changes by only one amino acid . adding helices  could expand the number of signaling receptors. the fact that each of the  <dig> sites in mcox2e potentially experiencing diversifying selection are sites whose constituent amino acids show interspecific variation as to whether they are within a helix or inter-helical loop, illustrates the potential importance that just a few positively selected sites could have on the evolution of mcox <dig> protein function.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that  mcox2e is unique to unionoidean bivalves,  mcox2e is functional and is likely the result of a single insertion event that took place over  <dig> mya,  the predicted tmh/ihl number, length and position variability likely stems from substitution-based processes rather than the typically implicated insertion/deletion events,  mcox2e has relatively high rates of evolution in its primary and secondary structures,  mcox2e displays evidence suggestive of site-specific positive selection,  mcox2e has an overall pattern of purifying selection that leads to the preservation of the tmh/ihl and hydrophilic c-terminus tail sub-regions, and  the more conserved c-terminus tail  is likely biologically active because it contains functional motifs. the rapid evolution of primary and secondary structure in mcox2e, combined with the action of purifying and possibly positive selection, provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that mcox2e has a novel reproductive function within unionoidean bivalves. furthermore, the presence of tmhs on the c-terminus side of the cox <dig> copper-binding site has never before been observed in metazoan mtdna. all tolled, our data indicate that unionoidean bivalve mcox <dig> is a chimeric animal mitochondrial protein that contains a unique and functional domain of unknown origin.
