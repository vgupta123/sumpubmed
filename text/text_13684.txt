BACKGROUND
sixty million bison also referred to as buffalo, roamed north america before  <dig>  <cit> . these comprised both the plains bison  found along the great plains, and the wood bison  restricted to the northwest territories and alberta. however, by mid- <dig>  these animals became nearly extinct; their numbers reduced to  <dig> as a result of indiscriminate hunting for hides, meat and sport. private herds held by ranchers and national parks enabled restoration of the bison population which were recorded at ~ <dig> million in  <dig>  <cit> . although no longer listed as endangered, bison are still treated as a “conservation” species because of their relative low numbers, ongoing breeding and selection practices  <cit> .

bison are phylogenetically related to the european bison , african  and asian buffaloes , yak  and domesticated cattle   <cit> . bison and cattle share several innate immunological features, some of which may actually help this animal combat shared diseases, most common of which are brucellosis, tuberculosis, anthrax, and malignant catarrhal fever  <cit> . while bison may acquire these infections in the wild, increased exposure has been associated with co-mingling domesticated ruminants  <cit> . additionally, a renewed interest in the low cholesterol and high protein bison meat has resulted in these animals being actively farmed, thereby enabling transmission of disease agents among bison and other livestock  <cit> . bison and cattle appear to share several gastrointestinal microflora, with the predominating gram-negative bacteria in fecal samples being escherichia coli   <cit> . studies evaluating the fecal e. coli serotypes indicate that while e. coli o157:h <dig>  may not be consistently isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of wild bison, it is prevalent in 17-83% of farmed bison much like its recovery from farmed asian water buffaloes  <cit> .

e. coli o <dig> are important foodborne, human pathogens that have been implicated in several outbreaks; an estimated  <dig>  illnesses,  <dig>  hospitalizations and  <dig> deaths occur annually in the united states  <cit> . human disease ranges from self-limiting watery diarrhea to debilitating bloody diarrhea that can advance into often-fatal secondary sequelae in susceptible patients  <cit> . the annual cost of these human shiga toxin-producing e. coli  infections range anywhere from $ <dig> to $ <dig> , depending on the severity of the disease caused  <cit> . cattle are the primary reservoirs for e. coli o <dig> and hence, food products derived from these ruminants contaminated with e. coli o157-containing manure are the major sources of infection  <cit> , resulting in large scale recalls of contaminated meat and produce. these recalls result in losses of up to millions of dollars annually for the meat industry  <cit> . adding to the complexity of this situation is cross-contamination of food from sources other than cattle, many of which remain unidentified, unregulated or under voluntary federal inspection  <cit> . bison is one such source; e. coli o <dig> has been isolated from bison retail meat, with variable levels of contamination  <cit> . recently, e. coli o157-contaminated ground bison was implicated in a multi-state outbreak, resulting in the recall of  <dig>  lbs of this meat  <cit> . reinstein et al., reported a  <dig> % e. coli o <dig> prevalence in bison feces at slaughter and the high recovery in the pasture-fed bison was correlated with similar prevalence in cattle fed forage diets  <cit> . given the recovery of e. coli o <dig> from bison  and its similarity to cattle, several studies are underway to determine e. coli o <dig> colonization patterns in this animal  <cit> . the rectoanal junction  is the primary site of e. coli o <dig> persistence in cattle gastrointestinal tracts, but a similar observation has not been conclusively made with bison  <cit> . hence, in this study, we  examined the cellular architecture via comparative histo-morphological studies of bison and bovine rectoanal junctions,  determined whether e. coli o <dig> could adhere to squamous epithelial  cells derived from bison rectoanal junctions, and  compared the patterns of e. coli o <dig> adherence to rse cells from both bison and bovine rectoanal junctions. our results indicate that bison are likely reservoirs of this human pathogen; it also extends the utility of the rse cell adherence assay for confirmatory studies of the same.

methods
animals and bacteria
eight cattle and five bison, included in unrelated experiments at the national animal disease center , ames, ia, under the approval of the nadc-animal care and use committee, were sampled in this study  <cit> . six of the eight cattle had been experimentally inoculated with e. coli o <dig>  <cit> ; a streptomycin-resistant derivative of the clinical e. coli o <dig> strain 86– <dig> . the remaining two cattle were part of the ‘blood donor’ group that is routinely maintained at the nadc, and not exposed to e. coli o <dig>  the cattle were of various breeds, ranged in age from  <dig> months to  <dig> years, and were fed according to their age, a post-weaning diet , or the nadc maintenance diet , protein supplements). the five bison were approximately  <dig> years in age and fed prairie hay and  <dig> pellets , and never inoculated with e. coli o <dig>  all animals had ad-libitum access to water. rectoanal junctions  tissue samples were recovered from all these animals at necropsy. the e. coli o <dig> strains 86– <dig> smr and edl  <dig>  <cit>  were used in the rse cell-adherence assays.

tissue sampling and histology
each raj tissue sample, dissected out of both bison and bovine gastrointestinal tracts, was divided into three parts to process using different techniques. one part of the raj was opened and its mucosal surface placed against a piece of liver from the same animal to support and maintain the structural integrity of this surface. the tissue assembled in this manner was then placed in the oct solution  and flash-frozen in isopentane on dry ice-ethanol bath before storing at -80°c  <cit> . the frozen tissue was sectioned in the laboratory using the leica cm  <dig> cryostat , and the sections collected on probe on + slides  were air-dried and fixed in 95% ethanol before staining  <cit> . the second part of the raj was fixed in 10% formalin 24–48 h, embedded in paraffin and sections prepared and processed on probe on + slides as described before  <cit> . the third piece was rinsed with sterile phosphate buffered saline  and transported to the laboratory in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium -no glucose  supplemented with  <dig> % fetal bovine serum , 100 μg/ml streptomycin-  <dig> u/ml penicillin  and 50 μg/ml gentamicin , to harvest the raj squamous epithelial  cells as described previously  <cit> .

staining
 immunofluorescent staining

ethanol-fixed slides were processed for immunofluorescent staining using a previously described protocol  <cit> . briefly, the slides were washed in pbs at room temperature and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in pbs  prior to incubation with selected primary antibody diluted in pbs . subsequently, slides were washed with pbs at room temperature and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody diluted in 5% normal goat serum in pbs . then the slides were washed, air dried in the dark and coverslipped with prolong gold antifade reagent containing the dna stain 4′, 6′- diamidino-2-phenylindole . when required, slides were permeabilized with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> prior to staining with phalloidin as recommended by manufacturer . primary and the corresponding secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescent staining are shown in table  <dig>  all slides were analyzed using the nikon eclipse e <dig> fluorescence microscope  equipped with fluorescence illumination and digital imaging. digital images were obtained using a digital sight ds-ri1camera  and acquired using the nis-elements imaging software . controls used to verify specificity of antibody interactions included slides with no bacteria or staining with unrelated fluorescence-tagged antibodies  <cit> .

 immunoperoxidase staining

indirect immunoperoxidase  staining was done at room temperature, on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded  tissue section slides, after de-paraffinization using standard protocols  <cit> . the slides were washed with tris-buffered saline , and processed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, slides were blocked with the universal block  and 5% normal rabbit serum  in tbs, and subsequently incubated  with goat anti-o <dig>  primary antibody. after three washes with tbs, the slides were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat  secondary antibody  which was traced with the avidin-tracer -complex solution , an enhancer solution prepared with  <dig> % brij  in tbs, and the diaminobenzidine hydrochloride  - peroxide solution. next, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin , washed, dehydrated in 95% and 100% ethanol before coverslipping in a 1: <dig> solution of permount and xylene .

rse cell adherence assay
adherence of e. coli o <dig> to bovine rse cells was previously demonstrated and developed into an adherence assay in our laboratory  <cit> . in the present study, the assay was used to compare interactions of e. coli o <dig> with rse cells obtained from bison versus bovine raj. each of the rse adherence assays was conducted in eight technical and two biological replicates as described previously  <cit> . briefly, rse cells were washed and resuspended in dmem-ng  with  <dig> % d + mannose to a final concentration of  <dig> cells/ml. bacterial pellets from overnight cultures in dmem-low glucose  were washed and mixed with rse cell suspensions to a final bacteria: cell ratio of 10: <dig> and incubated at 37°c, 110 rpm, for 4 h. subsequently, the mixture was pelleted, washed, reconstituted in 100 μl distilled water and eight-2 μl drops of this placed on polysine  slides. quenched, dried, and 95% ethanol-fixed slides were then stained with 1% toluidine blue, or fluorescence-tagged antibodies that target e. coli o <dig> and the rse cell cytokeratins as described previously . e. coli o <dig> adherence patterns on rse cells were recorded as either diffuse or aggregative  for all interactions that involved direct association with the cells, as described previously  <cit> . bacterial adherence was quantitated and the average percents with standard error of means between trials was calculated using the graphpad prism <dig> software, as before  <cit> . if more than 50% of rse cells had >  <dig> bacteria attached, the adherence was recorded as strongly positive. for > 50% rse cells with 1– <dig> adherent bacteria, the adherence was recorded as moderately positive. for less than 50% rse cells with 1– <dig> adherent bacteria, the result was recorded as nonadherent.

transmission electron microscopy 
 tissue preparation

portions of ffpe tissues were processed using a standard protocol  <cit> . after removal of paraffin, the samples were put through changes of xylene and immersed in graded alcohol solutions before being fixed with  <dig> % glutaraldehyde for 1–2 h, and transferred to pbs. the samples were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, processed through another series of graded alcohols, embedded in eponate 12™ resin  and polymerized at 60°c, overnight  <cit> .

 rse cells preparation

an ‘agar-block’ technique was devised that would enable capturing the rse cells and processing them like tissue samples. the rse cells , with and without adhering e. coli o <dig>  were fixed with  <dig> % glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer, overnight. next, the suspension was centrifuged; the resulting pellet was placed into molten 2% agar, and allowed to set in block-molds. the agar-blocks were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, processed and embedded in the eponate 12™ resin as described above  <cit> .

 negative staining

negative staining  <cit>  of rse cells- e. coli o <dig> suspensions was done as an initial screen to verify eukaryotic cell structure and presence of bacteria before proceeding with the agar-block preparation. briefly, equal volumes of sample and 2% phosphotungstic acid at ph  <dig>  were mixed and placed on formvar coated copper grids for 3 min. the excess liquid was wicked, grids air-dried and visualized on the fei tecnai™ g <dig> biotwin electron microscope.

 immunogold staining

thin sections of the eponate 12™ resin blocks embedded with tissue or rse cells with e. coli o <dig> were cut 70 nm thick on the leica uc <dig> ultratome . the sections were mounted on nickel grids and processed for colloidal gold staining  <cit>  as follows. the grids were incubated in 4% sodium metaperiodate solution  to expose reactive antigens on bacterial surface  <cit> . following multiple washes in water, the grids were incubated in  <dig>  m glycine  and blocked with 5% aurion bovine serum albumin in tbs, before floating them in goat anti-o <dig>  primary antibody diluted in tbs with  <dig> % tween <dig> . after further washes with tbs-t, the slides were incubated with aurion  <dig> nm gold labeled-rabbit anti-goat  secondary antibody. the grids were subsequently washed and counter-stained with uranyl acetate and reynolds lead citrate using standard protocols  <cit> , before viewing on the electron microscope. all reagents used for tem were obtained from electron microscopy services , hatfield, pa.

RESULTS
the raj sections from both cattle exposed to e. coli o <dig> and those that were never exposed to e. coli o <dig> demonstrated the same histo-morphology as previously described  <cit>  and observed by analyzing tissue sections by light, fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. regardless of their age and breed, the raj was characterized by an abrupt replacement of columnar epithelial cells by stratified squamous epithelial cells . the site at which this histological change occurred was either characterized by deep grooves in some animals or had planar presentation in others. irrespective of this, e. coli o <dig> when present interacted with the cells as described previously  <cit> . e. coli o <dig> formed microcolonies on the columnar epithelial cells, about 3–5 cm from the junction, and could often be associated with local microvilli effacement as well as pedestal formations extending from the columnar epithelial cell at the site of bacterial adherence . conversely, e. coli o <dig> adherence to the squamous epithelial cells was diffuse, and the bacteria appeared to adhere directly to the cell surface or pedestal-like surface structures .

to ascertain if bison would have similar raj histo-morphology as cattle, the bison and bovine raj was compared. as anticipated, based on the phylogenetic relationship of these animals, the cellular architecture of both rajs were similarly characterized with the columnar epithelial cell replacement by stratified squamous epithelial cells . additionally, even the various epithelial cell markers that were tested demonstrated similar distribution . villin, a structural protein component of the microvilli that comprise the brush borders  <cit> , was restricted to the columnar epithelial cells in both tissue samples, although these were more intensely detected in the bovine raj. this protein confers plasticity to the brush borders through its interactions with and cleavage of f-actin, the filament protein  <cit> . vimentin is an embryonic cytoskeleton filament protein involved in the intracellular transport of proteins between the nucleus and plasma membrane  <cit> . it continues to be expressed by fibroblasts lining the submucosa, occasional m cells and carcinogenic cells in adult animals  <cit> . the protein was detected in the submucosal layers of both bison and bovine raj tissue sections . cytokeratins are keratin containing structural proteins that extend like filaments from the surface of the nucleus to the cell membrane and contribute largely to maintaining cell-shape  <cit> . there are two types of cytokeratins, acidic and basic, which occur in pairs in an organ or tissue specific manner  <cit> . the anti-cytokeratin antibody  preparation used in this study ensured targeting this wide range of cytokeratins that are common to all epithelial tissue  <cit> . cytokeratins were found uniformly distributed in all epithelial cells comprising the raj of both animals . cadherins comprise a superfamily of transmembrane glycoproteins involved in calcium mediated cell-cell adhesion and hence, tissue integrity  <cit> . classical cadherins include epithelial-cadherin , neural-cadherin , placental-cadherin  and vascular endothelial-cadherin . since these cadherins appear to be broadly specific to cell-types, these proteins have also been associated with cell growth and tissue differentiation  <cit> . however, studies have reported a wider distribution of n-cadherins in non-neural tissues, of both human and bovine origin, including the mouth, breast, heart, kidney, liver, endometrium, endothelium and tumors  <cit> . here we observed that both e-cadherin and n-cadherin were co-localized to the epithelial cells lining the raj but interestingly, n-cadherin was more abundant, especially with the squamous epithelial cells. strong n-cadherin immunoreactivity has been associated with inflammed ileal tissues in cattle with johne’s disease, as also with proliferative epithelium lining the healthy endometrium  <cit>  and thus, the increased presence of n-cadherin at the raj may be related to the relatively rapid turn-over/growth of cells at this site. this distribution of e- and n- cadherins was similar to both bison and bovine raj tissue samples.

since the bison and bovine raj presented several anatomical and cytological similarities, we evaluated the ability of e. coli o <dig> to adhere to bison raj cells. in our previous studies, we had standardized an in vitro e. coli o <dig> adherence assay using harvested bovine raj squamous epithelial  cells  <cit> . an in-depth analysis showed that this assay with bovine rse cells successfully reproduced the e. coli o <dig> adherence patterns as seen in vivo on the raj of cattle infected with o <dig> . hence, we extrapolated the assay to include bison rse cells as a presumed reflection of e. coli o157-raj interactions in vivo in the bison. both e. coli o <dig> strains  adhered to the bison rse cells; the binding characteristics resembled those seen with bovine rse cells . except for the e. coli o <dig> strain 86– <dig> smr strain demonstrating diffuse, moderate adherence with bison rse cells, e. coli o <dig> strain edl  <dig> bound rse cells from both species in an aggregative, moderate pattern . e. coli o <dig> adherence to bison rse cells was verified and compared to bovine rse cells using fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy  further confirming the true adherence of e. coli o <dig> to these rse cells.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that the bison raj shares histo-morphological characteristics with the bovine raj. these overlapping features may have contributed to the ability of e. coli o <dig> to adhere to bison rse cells, thus extending this utility of the rse cell adherence assay for incorporation in bison studies. given that e. coli o <dig> has been isolated from bison retail meat, e. coli o157-contaminated bison meat has been implicated in an outbreak and that e. coli o <dig> has been isolated from these animals, this study supports that bison can serve as reservoirs for e. coli o <dig> in the wild. experimental studies in bison are being planned to determine whether e. coli o157-bison rse cell interactions seen in vitro occur in vivo as well.
