BACKGROUND
snap- <dig> along with syntaxin and synaptobrevin are the snare proteins known to be involved in exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons and of large dense-core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells  <cit> . the role of snap- <dig> in exocytosis has been studied in a variety of different experimental preparations  <cit> . these studies have shown that snap- <dig> appears to be required for most but not all evoked secretion. in order to further study the role of snap- <dig> in catecholamine secretion from pc <dig> cells we have used the recently developed technique of rna interference to generate pc <dig> cell lines with barely detectable levels of snap- <dig> 

rna interference is the sequence-specific "silencing" or "knockdown" of gene expression triggered by the introduction of double-stranded rna into a cell  <cit> . in mammalian cells this double-stranded rna must be short , but may be either a simple rna duplex with two unpaired nucleotides on the 3'-ends  or a small hairpin rna   <cit> . the sirna or shrna may be chemically synthesized, transcribed in vitro, produced by enzymatic cleavage of long double-stranded rna, or expressed in situ from a plasmid or viral vector. for cells, such as pc <dig> cells, where only a modest transfection efficiency can be achieved, the use of viral vectors or the establishment of cell lines stably transfected with a vector expressing an shrna are the best approaches to rna interference. production of stably transfected cell lines can be the most time-consuming option, but allows one-time characterization of the degree and specificity of gene silencing and affords a continuing source of well-characterized knockdown cells for experimentation.

in the work presented here we have established and characterized a pc <dig> cell line stably transfected with a plasmid that expresses an shrna specific for rat snap- <dig>  these cells have <5% of normal levels of snap- <dig>  but normal levels of all other synaptic proteins investigated. as expected, the snap- <dig> knockdown cells exhibited diminished catecholamine secretion in response to depolarizing stimuli.

RESULTS
a plasmid designed to express an shrna targeting rat snap- <dig>  was successfully constructed and transfected into  <dig>  ×  <dig> pc <dig> cells. a total of  <dig> colonies survived selection with g <dig>   <dig> colonies were isolated and grown up, and  <dig> of the colonies tested positive by pcr for incorporation of pg418shrna-snap- <dig>  the stable transfection efficiency was approximately  <dig> cell in  <dig> . all six of the stably transfected cell lines had significantly reduced levels of snap- <dig>  but the extent of knockdown varied among the cell lines . the cell line with the least  amount of snap- <dig> was chosen for further characterization and will be referred to as snap- <dig> knockdown cells . the stability of the snap- <dig> knockdown phenotype was confirmed by immunoblots showing that knockdown of snap- <dig> persisted for at least  <dig> weekly passages of the cells . in order to prevent phenotypic drift  the cultures were used for only 8– <dig> weeks before reverting to frozen stocks from an early passage. a similar number of colonies were obtained after transfection with the vector pg418shrna lacking an shrna insert, and one was chosen as the control stably transfected cell line. the control transfected cell line had levels of snap- <dig> comparable to the parent pc <dig> cells . although the snap- <dig> shrna expressed from pg418shrna-snap- <dig> was effective in silencing snap- <dig>  it did not conform fully to the most stringent guidelines for design of effective shrnas  <cit> .

the knockdown of snap- <dig> was specific in that levels of several other proteins known to be involved in catecholamine synthesis and secretion were unchanged  specifically levels of snap- <dig>  synaptotagmin i, syntaxin 1a, tyrosine hydroxylase and β-actin were unchanged in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells and in the control transfected cells. the knockdown of snap- <dig> was also very specific to rat snap- <dig> in that human and zebrafish snap- <dig> could be expressed from cdna plasmids in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells, but expression of rat snap- <dig> from a cdna plasmid was silenced . human and zebrafish snap- <dig> cdna differ from the rat snap- <dig> target site by only  <dig> or  <dig> of the  <dig> nucleotides, but these differences were sufficient to make human and zebrafish snap- <dig> mrna resistant to rna interference triggered by the rat snap- <dig> shrna. this resistance allowed the human snap- <dig> isoform to be used in rescue experiments described below  <cit> . note that the less intense snap- <dig> bands in lanes  <dig> and  <dig> of figure 2c do not reflect partial knockdown of human and zebrafish snap- <dig>  the snap- <dig> in lanes  <dig> and  <dig> is derived solely from the ~15–20% of cells that are transiently transfected with the human and zebrafish snap- <dig> cdna plasmids. the fact that 15–20% of the cells contain ~50% of the normal snap- <dig> means that human and zebrafish snap- <dig> is actually over-expressed  in the transiently transfected snap- <dig> knockdown cells. the more intense bands in the "control transfected" cell  represents normal levels of snap- <dig> in all the cells plus over-expression of snap- <dig> in the 15–20% of the cells transiently transfected with the snap- <dig> expression plasmids. densitometry of the immunoblot indicated that the amount of snap- <dig> in lanes 7– <dig> is approximately equal to the sum of snap- <dig> in untransfected pc <dig> cells  plus the human or zebrafish snap- <dig> in lanes  <dig> and  <dig> 

under some conditions shrnas and sirnas can lead to repression of translation rather than degradation of specific mrnas by rna interference  <cit> . the knockdown of snap- <dig> in the cell lines described here is presumably due to rna interference because levels of snap- <dig> mrna  were found to be reduced in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells . when a larger fraction of the reverse transcriptase reaction was used for pcr, some pcr product was obtained indicating that snap- <dig> mrna levels are reduced but not totally eliminated. snap- <dig> mrna levels could be quantified by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. however, knowing the extent of degradation of snap- <dig> mrna would not enhance the utility of the snap- <dig> knockdown cell line, so this option was not pursued.

amperometry experiments were carried out to determine whether knockdown of snap- <dig> affected catecholamine secretion from pc <dig> cells. the amperometric current recorded from a control transfected pc <dig> cell is shown in figure 3a. the trace shows that application of high-k+ for  <dig>  minutes elicited a large number of amperometric events. averaging every individual amperometric event during the high-k+ stimulation produced the average amperometric event shown to the right . figure 3b shows similar data from a snap- <dig> knockdown pc <dig> cell. it too had many events, but on average fewer than did control transfected cells. although the average amperometric event for these cells  tended to be smaller, the difference was not significant and the amount of neurotransmitter released by both types of cells was virtually identical . snap- <dig> knockdown cells produced an average of  <dig> release events per high-k+ stimulation, while control transfected cells produced an average of  <dig> release events . knockdown of snap- <dig> led to a 63% reduction in the total number of exocytotic events observed. because the area under the curve of amperometric events in control transfected and knockdown cells were virtually identical, this data suggests that snap- <dig> knockdown cells released ~37% of the neurotransmitter of that released by control transfected cells. transient over-expression of human snap- <dig> in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells rescued the deficit in neurotransmitter release . in this experiment, transfected cells were identified by co-expression of egfp. human snap- <dig> increased neurotransmitter release by ~ <dig>  fold.

discussion
we have used rna interference to generate a pc <dig> cell line with ~5% of normal levels of the snare protein snap- <dig>  and we have begun to characterize what effects the lack of snap- <dig> has on catecholamine secretion from these cells. rna interference is most commonly done on a transient basis, but the use of plasmid or viral vectors designed to express shrnas allows the generation of stable cells lines with permanently reduced levels of a specific protein  <cit> . stable expression of shrnas also allows effective suppression even of proteins that turn over slowly. stable cell lines can be characterized as to the specificity and extent of knockdown of the targeted gene product and then used without the need to assess or make assumptions about the effectiveness of knockdown in each transient transfection. the generation of stable cell lines also affords the possibility of obtaining cells with different levels of knockdown  <cit> . although the results reported here focus solely on the pc <dig> cell line with barely detectable levels of snap- <dig>  several other cell lines with varying levels of snap- <dig> were generated in the course of this work. these may be useful for investigating the effects of varying levels of snap- <dig> on secretion.

the ability to rescue or reverse an rna interference-induced effect using a version of the targeted gene that is not recognized by the sirna or shrna is considered to be one of the best controls for specificity in any rna interference experiment  <cit> . in the present work we have shown that the knockdown of endogenous rat snap- <dig> in pc <dig> cells is specific in that human and zebrafish snap- <dig> can be expressed in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells, and transient expression of human snap- <dig> rescued the deficits in catecholamine secretion observed in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells.

the role of snap- <dig> in exocytosis previously has been studied in snap- <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , in bovine chromaffin cells treated with botulinum toxins a or e to specifically cleave snap- <dig>  <cit> , and in a synaptosomal membrane preparation treated with antibodies against snap- <dig>  <cit> . the antibody treatment reduced ca2+-dependent glutamate release by 60–70%, but it was not clear whether the residual secretion was due to snap- <dig> that had escaped inactivation by the antibody or due to a snap-25-independent mechanism. cleavage of bovine chromaffin cell snap- <dig> by botulinum toxin e almost completely inhibited the secretion of catecholamines elicited by intracellular uncaging of chelated ca2+  <cit> . in contrast botulinum toxin a only partially inhibited catecholamine secretion  <cit> , and this inhibition could be partially overcome by higher intracellular levels of ca2+  <cit> . these studies provided strong evidence for a crucial role of snap- <dig> in exocytosis, but neither antibodies not botulinum toxins can produce an experimental preparation that truly lacks snap- <dig> as do homozygous snap- <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . in neurons cultured from embryonic snap- <dig> knockout mice, depolarization-induced exocytosis was not detectable while spontaneous neurotransmission persisted. in chromaffin cells isolated from embryonic snap- <dig> knockout mice, the fast burst of catecholamine secretion in response to uncaging of chelated ca2+ was abolished while a more prolonged elevation of intracellular ca2+ obtained by infusion of  <dig> μm ca2+ through a patch pipet reduced the number of amperometric spikes of catecholamine secretion in snap- <dig> knockout cells to about 33% of that in control cells  <cit> . this reduction in sustained secretion is very similar to the reduction in number of amperometric spikes measured in our snap- <dig> knockdown pc <dig> cells . the slow kinetics of bath application of high k+ did not allow us to evaluate the effect of snap- <dig> knockdown on the burst components of exocytosis. also similar to the findings in this study, the kinetic parameters of the amperometric spikes in snap- <dig> knockout chromaffin cells were similar to those found in wild-type cells  <cit> .

there has been one other report of snap- <dig> knockdown by rna interference  <cit> . in this study a plasmid expressing a snap- <dig> shrna was used to transiently knockdown snap- <dig> in cultured hippocampal neurons, but neurotransmitter release from these neurons was not examined.

the catecholamine secretion that persists in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells may be mediated by snap- <dig> homologs such as snap- <dig>  we did not observe any compensatory increase in snap- <dig> levels in the snap- <dig> knockdown cells, but the possible role of snap- <dig> or other snare proteins could be investigated by generating cell lines expressing two or more shrnas targeting distinct proteins. it has been shown that it is possible to use rna interference to knockdown more than one gene product  <cit> , and we have preliminary evidence that pc <dig> cells stably transfected with at least two plasmids can be generated at a reasonable frequency. the ability to specifically reduce levels of snap- <dig> and other constituent proteins of the snare complex in pc <dig> cells will provide a unique opportunity to study the roles of each of these proteins in exocytosis.

CONCLUSIONS
a pc <dig> cell line stably transfected with a plasmid expressing an shrna targeting snap- <dig> has been established. this snap- <dig> knockdown cell line has ~5% of normal levels of snap- <dig>  but normal levels of other synaptic proteins. catecholamine secretion elicited by depolarization of the snap- <dig> knockdown cells was reduced to 37% of control, but was restored by transient expression of human snap- <dig>  the combination of rnai and subsequent rescue with a gene from a different species in a cell line provides a viable method for the study of synaptic proteins that would otherwise be lethal in animals.
