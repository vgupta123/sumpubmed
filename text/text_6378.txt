BACKGROUND
the japanese native cattle kuchinoshima-ushi has long been bred on kuchinoshima island in the tokara archipelago of kagoshima prefecture, japan . kuchinoshima-ushi, which have been used mainly as pack animals, are characterized genetically as being lean with a small body size , wide breast, narrow waist, and horns. they have variable coat colours, including black, black with white spots, and brown. this phenotype is probably due to a population bottleneck caused by long-term isolation on this island. similarities between ancient japanese cattle described in historical records and kuchinoshima-ushi suggest that they have retained some features of ancient native cattle . currently, the four major japanese domestic cattle breeds, namely, japanese black, japanese brown, japanese shorthorn, and japanese polled, are bred mainly for meat in japan. these breeds were established by crossing japanese native cattle with several european cattle breeds during the mid-19th century to improve the native stock. however, the specific characteristics inherited by modern japanese domestic cattle are unknown.

since the first whole-genome assembly of the human genome in  <dig>  <cit> , the sequencing and assembly of mammalian genomes have quickly progressed. the bovine genome was assembled by the international bovine whole-genome sequencing project through a combination of shotgun and bacterial artificial chromosome  sequencing of an inbred hereford cow and her sire by using capillary sequencing  <cit> . recently, van tassell et al.  contributed more than  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  to the bovine snp database  by next-generation sequencing using a dairy breed  and seven major breeds of beef cattle  <cit> , and more than  <dig> million snps have been submitted to the bovine dbsnp to date. although the array approach with these snps is useful, the underlying snp resource is far from complete for understanding genome structure  <cit> . eck et al.  generated  <dig> gigabase  of sequence with an average  <dig> -fold sequence depth from a single fleckvieh bull by next-generation sequencing  <cit>  and identified more than  <dig> million previously unknown snps and  <dig>  small insertions and deletions  in comparison with the reference sequence. although the bovine genome and hapmap projects have progressed  <cit> , the sequences of japanese cattle have not been utilized in the respective projects. therefore, we conducted a whole-genome analysis to examine the genetic features of the japanese native cattle kuchinoshima-ushi and to gain a better understanding of the genetic relationship between domestic cattle breeds and kuchinoshima-ushi. this study provides detailed genetic information of this breed of cattle based on  <dig>  gb of sequence data generated by next-generation sequencing.

RESULTS
sequencing, mapping, and snp/indel detection
whole-genome sequencing was performed on a genome analyzer ii  using the genomic dna from a kuchinoshima-ushi male and generated  <dig>  gb of high quality sequence on  <dig> paired-end lanes . read mapping to the reference sequence  was performed using bwa  <cit> , and 86% of the obtained reads were successfully mapped to a unique position on the bovine reference genome sequence . of the total mapped reads,  <dig> , <dig>  were mapped to multiple chromosomal positions. we used uniquely mapped reads  for further analysis . the chromosomal distribution of the mapped reads was unbiased except for chromosome  <dig> . the number of reads mapped to chromosome  <dig> seemed higher than the average relative to the chromosome length. when we examined the read coverage of the chromosome  <dig> in detail, we found that most of the reads were mapped in a region known as the satellite repeat region. although it is unknown why such a number of reads were mapped preferentially in the satellite region of chromosome  <dig>  it is probably due to the feature of the mapping program bwa. we also performed mapping analysis using repeat-masking sequences ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/bostau4/bigzips/, which showed that high number of reads mapped to bta <dig> disappeared . it shows that the region with high number of reads mapped is masked as repeat.

on an average, 93% of the genome was covered by reads , and the number of mapped reads corresponds to  <dig> -fold coverage across the covered region. however, the previous study describing whole-genome sequencing of a fleckvieh bull reported that 98% of the genome was covered by the reads at a relatively low read depth   <cit> . the relatively lower genome coverage in our study is probably due to the fact that compared to the fleckvieh breed, the kuchinoshima-ushi breed is evolutionarily more distantly related to the breed of the reference genome . the difference in coverage can also be due to the number of prepared libraries .

using samtools  <cit> ,  <dig> , <dig> snps were detected;  <dig> , <dig>  were heterozygous and  <dig> , <dig>  were homozygous. of the identified snps,  <dig> , <dig>  were located in intergenic regions and  <dig>   were within the 5-kb regions upstream or downstream from gene regions . the remaining snps  were located in gene regions . the number of snps in each chromosome decreased in accordance with the decrease of the length of chromosomes, and the snp density in each 1-kb region of the total genome sequence showed that the chromosomal distribution of the snps was unbiased . the locations of the identified snps were also compared with those already published ;  <dig> % of the snp sites were found in the database, and the remaining  <dig> % were new. the percentage of newly identified snps in this study closely agreed with the results from a previous study  <cit> . we also investigated indel events and found  <dig>  . of these indels,  <dig>   were in intergenic regions,  <dig>   were within 5-kb upstream or downstream of gene regions, and  <dig>   were in gene regions . the number of indels in each chromosome decreased in accordance with decrease of the length of the chromosomes . the length of most indels was  <dig> bp .

sequence data were deposited in the ddbj read archive   and identified snps excluding ambiguous bases and those mapping to multiple locations unless providing more than  <dig> kbp flanking sequences were submitted to the single nucleotide polymorphism database  at ncbi under the handle tuangrc. in addition to submitting data to the standard repositories, the positions of the snps for kuchinoshima-ushi can be viewed in a customized installation of the ucsc genome browser http://www.nodai-genome.org/btau/cgi-bin/hggateway, along with supporting evidence .

functional annotation of nonsynonymous snps  and nssnp-containing genes
the snps in gene regions were annotated using the refseq and genbank gene sets . we found  <dig> , <dig> snps in introns,  <dig>  in untranslated regions ,  <dig> snps in splice-sites, and  <dig>  coding snps leading to  <dig>  nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions . the percentage of nonsynonymous changes in the coding region was  <dig> %, which was higher than that of any other previous studies of whole-genome resequencing in humans and cattle  <cit> . this finding would indicate on a possible occurrence of pseudogenes, the existence of proteins whose functions have been severely affected by extensive amino acid substitution, or significant differences in segmental duplications or copy number variants. alternatively, the number of nssnps might have increased due to the false positives created by incomplete annotation information.

in our kuchinoshima-ushi data set, nssnps were detected in a total of  <dig>  genes, which are listed in additional file  <dig>  gene ontology  terms associated with the  <dig> genes containing the highest number of nssnps were compared to those of all genes in the bovine whole genome by using the web-based tool agrigo  <cit> . the analysis showed that the genes associated with molecular functions such as protein binding, catalytic activity, and metabolic pathways and their regulation were enriched among the top  <dig> nssnp-containing genes in the kuchinoshima-ushi population . these results suggest the possibility that phenotypes associated with these genes may represent specific characteristics of the kuchinoshima-ushi breed. in contrast, genes involved in environmental adaptation such as sensory perception or immune function were not enriched in the list of the top  <dig> nssnp containing genes.

we also examined whether nssnp-containing genes were reportedly associated with economically important traits such as meat/milk production, growth rate, and domestication in other breeds of cattle. in order to extract information from studies reporting relationships between snps/genes and traits, we performed a pubmed search using economical traits such as growth rate or meat production as the query and limited the search to studies of bos taurus. from the result of the search, genbank/embl/ddbj nucleotide records reported in the obtained articles as well as sequences referred to in the articles as references  were extracted and compared with the list of nssnp-containing genes in our analysis of kuchinoshima-ushi.

of the  <dig>  nssnp-containing genes,  <dig> matched to genes that have been reported to be potentially associated with economically important traits such as meat/milk production, growth rate, and domestication in other cattle breeds  <cit>  . some of the genes were also found to reside at positions of significant quantitative trait loci ; for example, body growth-associated genes such as genes for growth hormone , growth hormone receptor , and leptin receptor   <cit> ; lactation-related genes like prolactin receptor  and caseins ; and genes encoding immune-related proteins in milk, such as toll-like receptors   <cit> .

recently, associations between snps and phenotypes have been reported in many studies, including cattle  <cit> . some snp sites identified in kuchinoshima-ushi have already been reported to be associated with phenotypes in other cattle breeds . for example, a mutation found in the fatty acid binding protein  <dig>  was reported to be associated with palmitoleic acid  content in intramuscular fat in japanese black cattle  <cit> . a mutation of the urotensin  <dig> receptor  was associated with skeletal muscle fat accumulation in wagyu × limousin population  <cit>  and a mutation in calpain  <dig>  was associated with meat tenderness in aberdeen angus-cross cattle  <cit> . the nssnps found in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing  <dig>  gene were associated with the estimated breeding values for somatic cell score in canadian holstein cattle  <cit> . identified snp sites in the lep and lepr genes were associated with fat content in carcass meat of other cattle breeds including nellore, holstein-friesian, angus, charolais, hereford, and simmental  <cit> .

nevertheless, population genetic studies in the kuchinoshima-ushi breed are required to validate the identified nssnps and to examine their association with relevant phenotypic traits in this population. also, most nssnps identified in kuchinoshima-ushi have yet to be reported, nor have their functions or associations been investigated; new nssnps identified in this study will be valuable for future research.

phylogeny of bovine-related species
to understand the genetic relationships between kuchinoshima-ushi and other breeds of cattle, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis. the resultant maximum likelihood tree of bovine-related species is shown in figure  <dig>  bovinae subfamily relationships were largely consistent with those in an earlier study  <cit> , with the exception of the phylogenetic position of bison and the sister-group relationship between east asian river buffalo  and swamp buffalo . two subtribes, namely, bovina and bubalina, formed a monophyletic group with high maximum likelihood  bootstrap  and bayesian posterior probability  support , respectively. in the bovina clade, hereford, holstein, tuli, and kuchinoshima-ushi comprised a monophyletic group with high statistical support , and kuchinoshima-ushi was the sister lineage of all other breeds of bos taurus cattle with relatively high statistical support . among species of wild cattle that have never been subjected to selective breeding, such as banteng and gaur, kuchinoshima-ushi was the nearest species of domesticated cattle. these data also suggest that kuchinoshima-ushi would be an appropriate breed for investigating adaptations associated with the domestication of wild cattle. when the sequence data of japanese domestic breed of cattle such as japanese black will be available, the phylogenetic position of "japanese native cattle" should be revealed more clearly.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, japanese native cattle kuchinoshima-ushi, which have retained their phenotype over time without being affected genetically by european domestic breeds, were used for whole-genome resequencing with a next-generation sequencer. we identified  <dig>  million snps, of which more than  <dig>  million  were found to be new. among the identified snps, some nonsynonymous snps were found in genes that have been reported as candidate genes for qtl affecting economically important traits in other cattle breeds. the results of phylogenetic analysis showed the phylogenetic position of kuchinoshima-ushi. in the current status of domestic cattle, repeated selection for specific traits such as weight gain as well as milk and meat production has progressed, but problems have emerged with unconsidered traits such as reproduction and disease resistance. our results provide a framework for future investigations aiming at the understanding of gene functions and identifying the molecular basis underlying phenotypic variation of economically important traits in domestic cattle breeds. it would contribute to the development of a new, more efficient breeding system preferentially for east asian domestic cattle breeds including japanese one. furthermore, genome information for kuchinoshima-ushi is expected to be important not only in revealing the genetic structure of a geographically isolated breed originating from ancient, native japanese cattle but also in identifying genetic traits that distinguish domestic breeds from original, undomesticated species.
