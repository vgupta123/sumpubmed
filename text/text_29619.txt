BACKGROUND
pseudorabies virus , also known as aujeszky’s disease virus, a herpesvirus belonging in the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae, infects swine populations and causes economic losses worldwide. prv is widely used in studies of the molecular pathomechanism of herpesviruses  <cit> , as a tract-tracing tool for mapping neuronal circuitries  <cit>  and for the delivery of genetically encoded fluorescent activity markers  <cit> . the transcription of herpesviruses is strictly regulated by cascade-like processes. three temporal classes of viral genes can be distinguished in terms of the time of their activation during the viral life cycle: initially, the immediate-early  genes are expressed, whose protein products are transcription factors. prv has a single ie-class gene, ie <dig>  which is the major regulator of viral gene expression. the early  genes typically play roles in the replication of viral dna, while most of the late  genes code for structural elements of the virus. the prv genome is arranged into two unique protein coding regions, the unique long  and unique short  regions, flanked by the internal and terminal repeats . the genome of prv is large among viruses, but much smaller than those of cellular organisms, and especially the mammalian genome. the whole transcriptome analysis of prv can therefore be performed by real-time rt-pcr, a technique, which provides an accurate platform for the temporal analysis of transcription in both wild-type  <cit>  and mutant viral strains  <cit> . however, pcr can target only a small genomic region, and information related to transcript lengths, splicing, alternative initiation and termination of transcription, unknown transcripts, etc. is not provided. furthermore, pcr is inconvenient for the detection of novel transcripts. coding sequences and their related transcripts have been widely studied in prv  <cit> , together with the microrna expression in both the lytic and latent phases of the viral life cycle  <cit> , whereas other sources of non-coding transcription, alternative transcript termination and alternative splicing have not yet been analyzed at a genome-wide level. in order to complement previous rt-pcr based studies, we have carried out high-throughput sequencing of the total rna and polya rna fractions of prv during lytic infection. transcriptome-wide profiling has led to the discovery of novel regulatory rnas and an accurate assessment of their expression in several members of the herpesviridae . these studies have discovered highly abundant long non-coding rnas , while in addition, the characterization of the mat ncrna in murine cytomegalovirus has shown its role not only as a lncrna, but also coding for an orf with potential regulatory functions  <cit> . host-pathogen interaction studies have also revealed dramatic changes in expression levels of a range of host regulatory- and non-coding rnas during lytic infection with varicella zoster virus  <cit> . recent findings suggest that, similarly as in eukaryotes, alternative transcript termination might be an important regulatory mechanism in herpesvirus gene expression  <cit> . indeed, the assessment of 3′ utrs in prv strain kaplan  identified three genes, each containing two alternative termination sites, while also indicating individual polyadenylation  sites of genes previously recognized as being exclusively transcribed in polycistronic rnas and not possessing their own pa sites. the pa sites have also been categorized in terms of relative expression levels by determining the overall frequency of proximal and distal pa-site usage per gene.

RESULTS
assessment of the prv transcriptome by total rna sequencing and pa-seq
for the investigation of the lytic prv transcriptome, porcine kidney  epithelial cells were infected with a high dose  of prv strain ka. samples were gathered up to 24 h post-infection  in order to capture all rna species during lytic infection for sequencing library preparation. both random hexamer-primed and oligo-primed libraries were prepared in order to assess total rna and mrna transcripts separately. in our modified polyadenylation sequencing  protocol  <cit> , total rna was reverse-transcribed by using custom designed oligo anchored primers containing standard illumina strand-specific adaptor sequences. the two-nucleotide anchor sequence ensures the annealing of primers at exactly the pa site of mrnas, providing considerably fewer reads that contain redundant adenine homopolymer stretches, with more useful sequence information resulting for the given depth of sequencing. pa peaks were detected by using homer  <cit>  in strand-specific mode, with adjustments for viral cdna peak calling and a cutoff of  <dig> reads per base position. pa peaks occurred on both strands, mainly in accordance with previously existing orf annotations, and also long non-coding rnas, including the latency-associated transcript  and the long-latency transcript .

both the rna integrity measurements during the sample preparation, and the low signal-to-noise ratio in the 1 kb region surrounding the pa peaks during the analysis indicated high library quality. sequencing of the total rna isolates of infected cells yielded a data set of ~  <dig> million 100 bp paired-end reads for the random hexamer-primed library, of which  <dig>  million reads aligned to the viral genome version kj <dig> , and the majority of the remaining sequences aligned to the host organism genome sus scrofa  <dig> . pa-seq resulted in ~  <dig> million single- end, 50 bp reads, with  <dig> million reads aligning to the above-mentioned viral reference.

prv transcriptome profiling
nearly all of the viral genome was transcribed, with the exception of highly repetitive sequences within the terminal and internal repeats that do not encode any rna species. similarly, there was no detectable transcription at intergenic repeat regions, which were earlier predicted to be transcriptional insulators  <cit> . significant transcription at these insulator sequences was observed only in two convergently oriented gene pairs, ul44-ul <dig> and, to a lesser extent, ul35-ul <dig>  here, the alternative transcript termination indicates that leaky transcription traverses the intergenic repeat boundaries with lengths of 109 bp and 443 bp, respectively. on the other hand, non-transcribed, repetitive regions were markedly present between orf- <dig> and ul54; ul <dig> and ul27; ul <dig> and ul41; and ul <dig> and ul <dig>  in these boundary regions, no expression was observable. a high percentage of the transcription is committed to producing a newly identified non-coding rna, cto , located between the ul <dig> gene and the oril, between bases 63673– <dig> on the complementary strand of genome kj <dig> . the cto  and us <dig>  encoding the icp <dig> homolog rsp <dig> immediate-early regulatory protein are the most abundant transcripts. although we examined lytic infection, the two latency-associated transcripts  were found to be expressed at a low level, and not at sufficient coverage to determine splicing donor and acceptor sites. transcription of the hypothetical orf <dig>   <cit>  sequence was also detected, involving 5′ upstream regions, although single-base localization of the transcription start site is complicated by the presence of several repeats in the genomic sequence in the interval 730–960 bp. on the use of pa-seq, 3′ transcript boundaries can be accurately identified between and within gene clusters . in convergently oriented clusters, more extensive overlaps include coding regions of the opposite genes, potentially giving rise to transcriptional interference between the interacting partners  <cit> . an example of such a relation is between ul <dig> and ul <dig>  with a tail-to-tail overlap of  <dig> nucleotides. here, the expression of ul <dig> mrna exceeds that of ul <dig>  with considerable antisense expression over the latter gene, possibly due to transcriptional read-through from ul <dig>  as anticipated, convergent genes with more than ~45 bp separating their respective pa signals  do not demonstrate detectable transcriptional overlap, ranging from ul18-ul <dig>  to ul46-ul <dig> , while convergent gene pairs in closer proximity exhibit longer 3′ utr overlapping regions. a short, 3′-overlapping antisense non-coding transcript  was also found adjacent to the pa site of the ul <dig> gene, near oril , with an expression of rpkm =  <dig> × <dig> in the total rna library, the highest non-coding antisense expression in our samples. the various overlaps between the viral genes are presented in table  <dig>  these overlaps may affect the expression of adjacent genes. it is hypothesized that these interactions form a regulatory network controlling the transcription cascade of herpesviruses  <cit> .fig.  <dig> transcriptional map of the prv genome identified by total rna sequencing and pa-seq. genetic map: orange: coding sequences, blue: transcripts, red striped rectangle: oril palindrome, yellow striped rectangles: oris palindromes, grey: internal and terminal repeat regions, blue circles: pa site on + strand, red circles: pa site on –strand, green circles: alternative pa site on + strand, black circles: alternative pa site on –strand. expression levels : upper box: pa-seq expression, green: +strand read coverage, black: −strand read coverage, lower box: totalrna sequencing, blue: +strand coverage, red: −strand coverage

splice sites in the prv transcriptome
for splice site analysis, total rna reads were aligned to prv strain ka genome kj <dig> . all possible splice donor and acceptor sites were considered, with a lower bound of at least  <dig> supporting reads. through the exclusion of low-coverage junction candidates, artifacts possibly occurring due to mispriming or template switching during amplification steps could be neglected . the initial set of splice acceptor and donor sites contained  <dig> candidate splice junctions, with  <dig> sites above the threshold coverage. this set contained several permutations of the us <dig> 3′ utr splice junctions, which were screened for the presence of short anchor regions and high mismatch ratios within these anchors. after screening for anchors of < <dig> bases, consistent splice junctions were readily identifiable. the remaining, high-coverage splice sites are denoted as follows: , with d denoting the donor site, a the acceptor site, and +/− the dna top and bottom strand, respectively, along the coordinates of the splice junction. splice sites have previously been characterized in the protein-coding region of ul <dig>  <cit>  , and in the 3′ utr of us <dig>  <cit>  , present in both terminal and internal repeats, while one site in the non-coding rna llt  <cit>   was expressed at an insufficient level for accurate splice site identification. a low percentage of reads also mapped outside the assigned acceptor and donor sites . a novel alternative splice site was characterized in ep <dig>  the homolog of herpes simplex  <dig> icp <dig>  <cit> , which is also a spliced gene, but expressed in the immediate-early class in hsv- <dig>  the newly characterized ep <dig> alternative splicing consists of two potential donor sites at  and  and the acceptor site at  . while the splice junction formed between the acceptor and proximal donor sites conforms to the rule of gt/ag nucleotides comprising ~99 % of junctions in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> , the junction formed with the distal donor site contains gt/cg bases. experimental validation of the novel splice site has been carried out by rt-pcr, using two primer sets  designed approximately 100 bp upstream and downstream of the splice site, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the experiments confirmed the presence of the novel isoform during lytic infection robustly after visualization .fig.  <dig> rt-pcr validation of the novel splice site of the ep <dig> gene, using two different primer sets. 12 % acrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel red staining



frequency of alternative polyadenylation correlated to weak and strong pa signals and flanking motifs
through the use of the highly sensitive pa-seq method, the 3′-end of the prv transcripts was identified by the presence of poly tails. the use of anchored oligo primers resulted in the accurate mapping of polyadenylation sites, while providing a high coverage for quantitative analyses . the most highly abundant transcripts  were in accordance with the random hexamer-primed data, while the greater resolution provided by pa-seq also allowed the identification of transcripts that were of low abundance or difficult to detect by other sequencing methods or rt-pcr, such as the genes of the ul6-ul <dig> convergently oriented cluster. the pas-usage of eukaryotic organisms is thought to be well conserved, with the canonical aauaaa being the most widely used signal 10– <dig> nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site  <cit> . not surprisingly, the analysis of the pas motifs indicated that strong polyadenylation peaks correspond to the aauaaa signal , while auuaaa is the second most widely used element  . two further signal motifs were the less conserved use gu-rich element, > <dig> nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site  <cit> , and dse, > <dig> nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. in humans, it has been shown that when multiple pa sites are used, the 3′ -most tends to use the aauaaa signal, while the inner signals tend to vary considerably from the consensus  <cit> . in our pa-seq samples, only  <dig> genomic positions containing the canonical aataaa sequence proved to be unused pa signals,  <dig> motifs residing inside coding sequences  and one motif located directly upstream of us <dig> , and not corresponding to any viral transcript. the remaining signal was located within the large repeat regions, and therefore present in two copies,  and . on the other hand, canonical pas that were previously considered inactive demonstrated pronounced polyadenylation peaks, providing alternative transcript termination sites for genes ul <dig>  ul <dig> and ul <dig>  in both cases, the usage frequency of the distal pa site was at least an order of magnitude lower than those of the proximal ones.fig.  <dig> pa signal consensus of prv and schematic organization of eukaryotic pa sites. the sequence logo represents nucleotide occurrence frequencies within the +/−50 bp region of pa signals in the viral genome. colored boxes indicate the functional elements affecting eukaryotic polyadenylation



the pa-seq method additionally revealed polyadenylation peaks in transcripts encoded by upstream genes of tandem gene clusters. these included the polyadenylation of ul <dig>  this transcript has previously been detected in strain indiana-funkhauser  <cit> , with the non-canonical pas atataaa; in our pa-seq samples, we have confirmed the active use of this site in strain ka. a similar arrangement was found in ul <dig>  although no conservative pas was detectable upstream of the well-defined pa-peak at base position  <dig>  though pa peaks within the clusters of the us region were markedly above the background signal and correlated well with the coding sequence boundaries, these signals were several orders of magnitude weaker than the commonly observed polya peaks, making them difficult to validate. the tandemly oriented ul <dig> transcript has been hypothesized to be 3′ coterminal with the ul <dig> transcript  <cit> , as the canonical pas directly downstream of ul <dig> is inside the ul <dig> orf. however, pa-seq peaks were found at the 3′ ends of both genes, showing that the pas of ul <dig> is also active. the most abundant transcript during prv lytic infection proved to be a previously unknown non-coding rna of 286 bp, located between genes ul <dig> and ul <dig>  and named cto. this long non-coding rna is characterized by an irregular gc composition, where the third-position gc content increases sharply in all three reading frames in the length of the transcript. based on sequence similarity search, this arrangement is not present in the close relatives of prv, such as varicella zoster, herpes simplex and bovine herpesviruses. on the other hand, prv strains becker, bartha and hen <dig> show <99 % sequence similarity with strain kaplan in the cto genomic region. an alternative pa site was also observed, about  <dig> nucleotides downstream from the main pas. an in-depth characterization of the transcript is presented in  <cit> .

transcription overlaps
we assessed the various transcript overlaps, including parallel , divergent and convergent overlaps . most of the prv genes are organized into tandem gene clusters producing polycistronic rnas . an interesting feature of organization is that all of the upstream genes of the clusters end within the downstream genes. similarly, the divergent gene pairs overlap in every case. theoretically, this phenomenon may be explained by the restriction of the viral genome length. however, since these overlaps are not too extensive, they probably provide a regulatory mechanism for transcription. the distant convergent genes are separated from each other by repetitive sequences which were found to be heavily methylated , indicating a mechanism with a likely function for the prevention of transcriptional collisions. closely located convergent gene pairs transcriptionally overlap or can overlap  themselves . in the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes, these alternative termination sites traversed intergenic repetitive regions, previously considered to be transcriptional barriers. this finding indicates that low-frequency “leaky” transcription occurs more often than anticipated in prv. although the function of these pa sites is unknown, it is noteworthy that a highly similar arrangement was present between convergent gene clusters ul9-ul <dig> and ul7-ul <dig>  with the difference that a strongly repetitive sequence resembling the above-mentioned intergenic repeats in both length and base content, was found within the comparatively long 3′ utr of ul <dig> fig.  <dig> convergent , divergent  and tandem  overlaps in the prv genome, as shown by random-hexamer primed samples. extensive transcriptional overlaps are frequent throughout the condensed viral genome. black boxes: coding sequences, white arrows: gene orientation, grey line graph: positive strand expression, black line graph: negative strand expression



CONCLUSIONS
the single-base resolution map of pseudorabies transcripts revealed that the compact,  <dig> kbp genome of prv is transcribed pervasively, with the exception of loci in the large inverted repeats and short intergenic sequences. in addition to previously known splice sites, a novel junction was characterized in the transactivator ep <dig>  while the splice sites of lytic genes were confirmed at a high depth of coverage. polyadenylation signal usage was found to be more frequent than previously predicted, with alternative pas in genes ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig> and ul <dig>  while alternative transcript termination is a major regulatory factor in eukaryotic organisms, to date there is limited data for viruses in this field. the region of the lytic replication origin was also found to express a novel, highly abundant ncrna, named cto, along with a short, 3′ overlapping ncrna of ul <dig>  termed sanc. other pervasively transcribed regions include the orf <dig>  5′ utr. the described prv transcript isoforms and non-coding rnas help guide future research in the possible regulatory mechanisms of alphaherpesviruses.
