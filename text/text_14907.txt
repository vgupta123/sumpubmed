BACKGROUND
recent genome-wide sequences of various animals have uncovered unexpected diversifications of opsin genes, which encode protein moieties of photoreceptor proteins, in most animals. the biological meaning of the diversification of visual opsins has been well studied; multiple visual opsins with different spectral sensitivities are responsible for color vision and other visual functions . most animals also possess multiple opsins that underlie non-visual functions such as circadian photoentrainment, suggesting their possible diverse and complicated involvement in varied types of non-visual photoreception . however, the significance of the diversification of non-visual opsins remains uncertain, although comparative studies of duplicated non-visual opsins such as melanopsin and vertebrate ancient-long -opsin have revealed differences in their expression patterns . the pineal and related organs of non-mammalian vertebrates are a good model for examining this issue because they are photosensitive organs with diverse functions. one such function is light-dependent regulation of melatonin secretion, which is involved in various physiological functions such as regulation of locomotor activity and sleep  <cit> . in addition, two types of neural sensing, achromatic responses for luminescence detection and chromatic responses for wavelength discrimination, are well known  <cit> .

some opsins that serve as so-called pineal photopigments have previously been identified. pinopsin was the first pineal opsin to be identified in vertebrates, and was originally isolated from chicken pineal organs . it has been suggested that pinopsin is involved in light-dependent regulation of melatonin secretion in chicken  <cit> . since this discovery, parapinopsin has been identified in the teleost and lamprey pineal and parapineal organs  <cit> , and exo-rhodopsin in the teleost pineal organs  <cit> . in lizard parietal eyes , the expression of parietopsin as well as pinopsin or parapinopsin has been revealed  <cit> . the genome-wide sequencing of zebrafish revealed the existence of two genomic dnas encoding opsins that are highly similar to parapinopsins, indicating that zebrafish have another parapinopsin in addition to the ortholog of parapinopsin originally identified in catfish and rainbow trout  <cit> .

recently, we used spectroscopic, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analyses to demonstrate that parapinopsin is the ultraviolet -sensitive photopigment underlying pineal uv reception in the lamprey  <cit> . the pineal organs of lampreys and teleosts, as well as the pineal-related organs of frogs  and lizards , detect the ratio of uv to visible light in the environment , suggesting that these non-mammalian vertebrates can discriminate between different wavelengths of light using the pineal and related organs, independently of image-forming color vision in the eyes  <cit> . in previous studies, the electrophysiological response most sensitive to uv light was only observed in chromatic responses for wavelength discrimination and not in achromatic responses for luminescence detection in lamprey and teleost pineal organs . we isolated parapinopsin from rainbow trout and clawed frogs, in which the pineal and related organs have been reported to exhibit antagonistic chromatic responses to uv and visible light  <cit> . in addition, parapinopsin expression in the pineal organ of a closely related species of rainbow trout was recently reported  <cit> . these facts suggest that parapinopsin may be the common molecular basis for pineal uv reception in wavelength discrimination. this idea is supported by our recent finding that parapinopsin is expressed in the photoreceptor cells of the iguana parietal eye, where the ratio of uv to visible light is detected  <cit> .

here, we investigated and compared two types of parapinopsins in teleosts, pp <dig> and pp <dig>  in order to clarify the functional meanings of the diversification. our spectroscopic, immunohistochemical and transgenic analyses of teleost parapinopsins revealed that pp <dig> is a uv-sensitive pigment, similar to the lamprey parapinopsin involved in wavelength discrimination, while pp <dig> is a blue-sensitive pigment that could be involved in melatonin secretion rather than wavelength discrimination. current findings indicate that the diversification of parapinopsin with respect to spectral sensitivity contributes to other pineal function besides wavelength discrimination, which could be a link between the diversification of non-visual pigments and diverse photoreception in animals.

RESULTS
two parapinopsins in teleosts
based on two genomic dna fragments found in the zebrafish genome database that encode opsins which are highly similar  to the lamprey parapinopsin, we isolated two parapinopsin genes  via the homology-based deduction of exons and subsequent full-length cdna cloning. we also found two parapinopsins in several teleost genome databases, including northern pike, in which pineal antagonistic chromatic responses to uv and visible light were reported  <cit> . furthermore, we found another parapinopsin in addition to the previously reported one  <cit>  from the rainbow trout pineal organ, which is also demonstrated to exhibit the antagonistic chromatic responses  <cit> . these results indicate that teleosts generally have two parapinopsins. the molecular phylogenetic tree of vertebrate visual and non-visual opsins, including these parapinopsins, revealed that teleost pp1s form one cluster with the previously reported catfish parapinopsin, and pp2s form another cluster . interestingly, our comprehensive survey of parapinopsin genes in vertebrate genome databases revealed that the spotted gar has only one parapinopsin, which raises a possibility that the gene duplication giving rise to pp <dig> and pp <dig> occurred via teleost-specific genome duplication   <cit>  because spotted gar diverged before the tsgd  <cit> . in fact, the phylogenetic tree based on bayesian analysis seems to support this scenario, although the statistical support for the tree topology was not strong . however, the phylogenetic tree inferred with the maximum likelihood method supported another evolutionary relationship, which was also not statistically significant . we conducted a synteny analysis of genomic regions around the parapinopsin gene in teleosts including the spotted gar to obtain a clue to the timing of the diversification of pp <dig> and pp <dig>  we found conserved synteny blocks composed of parapinopsin gene and at least five gene families  between the paralogous genomic regions of some teleosts and between the teleosts and spotted gar genomes . the phylogenetic analyses of three out of the five gene families revealed that the duplications of teleost paralogs occurred after the split of spotted gar, suggesting that the paralogous genomic regions identified in the synteny analysis are derived from tsgd . taken together, it is plausible that pp <dig> and pp <dig> were duplicated via tsgd.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic positions of the two teleost parapinopsins. the molecular phylogenetic tree based on the bayesian framework contains vertebrate visual and non-visual pigments. two hundred and fifty six aligned sites were used for the tree inference. posterior probabilities of more than  <dig>  are indicated at branch nodes. the black circle indicates the gene duplication that gave rise to two kinds of parapinopsins. lws long wavelength-sensitive opsin, mws middle wavelength-sensitive opsin, p pinopsin, pp parapinopsin, pp <dig> teleost pp <dig>  pp <dig> teleost pp <dig>  pt parietopsin, rh rhodopsin, sws <dig> short wavelength-sensitive type <dig> opsin, sws <dig> short wavelength-sensitive type <dig> opsin, va vertebrate ancient opsin. scale bar =  <dig>  substitutions per site

diversification of teleost parapinopsin with respect to spectral sensitivity
we investigated and compared the molecular properties of two teleost parapinopsins. we expressed parapinopsins of several teleosts using a mammalian cultured cell expression system, and successfully obtained the purified photosensitive pigments. spectroscopic analyses showed that the zebrafish and pufferfish pp1s, and spotted gar parapinopsin have absorption maxima at 360– <dig> nm in the uv region , indicating that they are uv-sensitive pigments similar to the lamprey parapinopsin  <cit> . surprisingly, the zebrafish, pufferfish, and rainbow trout pp2s exhibited absorption maxima in the visible light region, with peaks at ~ <dig> nm, ~ <dig> nm, and ~ <dig> nm, respectively, indicating that teleost pp <dig> is a blue light-sensitive pigment . we also found that, regardless of the absorption spectra in the dark, all of these teleost parapinopsins are bistable pigments, which generate a stable photoproduct upon light absorption, and revert to their original state upon subsequent light absorption , like the lamprey parapinopsin,  <cit>  and unlike vertebrate visual pigments. these results indicate that parapinopsins have diverse spectral sensitivities , although they are bistable as one of their basic features.fig.  <dig> uv-sensitive and blue-sensitive parapinopsins. absorption spectra in the dark  and after light-irradiation  for a zebrafish pp <dig>  b pufferfish pp <dig>  c spotted gar parapinopsin, d zebrafish pp <dig>  e pufferfish pp <dig>  and f rainbow trout pp <dig>  note that the absorption spectrum of zebrafish pp <dig> after light-irradiation  was calculated based on the spectral change measured using pre-purified samples  and the rainbow trout pp <dig> was not successfully expressed in cultured cells



mutually exclusive expression of the two parapinopsins in the teleost pineal organ
next, we investigated the tissue distribution of pp <dig> and pp <dig> in zebrafish. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  revealed high mrna expression levels of pp <dig> and pp <dig> in the zebrafish pineal organ, but not in the eye or brain . this contrasted with the distribution of the uv-sensitive cone opsin , which was expressed in the eye and not in the pineal organ . we also conducted immunohistochemical analyses with antibodies specific for the c-terminal region of zebrafish pp <dig> and pp <dig> in order to investigate the localization of pp <dig> and pp <dig> in the pineal organ in detail. in the zebrafish pineal organ, pp <dig> and pp <dig> were localized to the rostral region of the organ, and the distribution of pp2-expressing cells was broader than that of the pp1-expressing cells in the region . this is in contrast to the broad expression pattern of the major photopigment exo-rhodopsin, which is distributed throughout the zebrafish pineal organ  <cit> . immunohistochemical analysis of transverse sections of the rostral pineal organ revealed the mutually exclusive expression of pp <dig> and pp <dig> . to investigate whether this expression profile is common to teleosts, we also investigated the distribution of pp <dig> and pp <dig> in the “i”-shaped pufferfish and rainbow trout pineal organs, which are morphologically different from the “t”-shaped zebrafish pineal organ. in both the pufferfish and rainbow trout pineal organs, pp <dig> and pp <dig> were expressed in different photoreceptor cells in the rostral area , as observed in the zebrafish pineal organ . this finding suggests that the expression profile is widely shared among teleosts.fig.  <dig> mutually exclusive localization of pp <dig> and pp <dig> in the zebrafish pineal organ. a expression profiles of pp <dig> , pp <dig> , uv-sensitive cone opsin  and β-actin as a reference  in zebrafish. expected band sizes of pcr fragments of pp <dig> , pp <dig> , uv-sensitive cone opsin , and β-actin  based on mobility of standard markers are indicated on the left. immunofluorescent labeling of b pp <dig> and c pp <dig>  in the rostral area of the sagittal sections of zebrafish pineal organs. sections are shown with the dorsal side up, ventral side down, rostral side left and caudal side right. d schematic drawing of the dorsal view of the zebrafish pineal organ, rostral side left and caudal side right. the red line indicates the approximate region of the sagittal sections in  and . e double immunofluorescent labeling of pp <dig>  and pp <dig>  shows the mutually exclusive distribution of pp <dig> and pp <dig> in the zebrafish pineal organ. the scale bars represent  <dig> μm



different characteristics of pp2-expressing cells from pp1-expressing cells
the finding that pp <dig> is not a uv-sensitive pigment but a blue-sensitive pigment raised questions about the potential involvement of pp <dig> in pineal wavelength discrimination. in addition, the mutually exclusive expression of two parapinopsins, which is conserved in three teleost species, allows pp1-expressing and pp2-expressing cells to capture light independently. in order to characterize pp1-expressing and pp2-expressing cells and examine their involvement in pineal wavelength discrimination, we generated transgenic zebrafish in which either pp1-expressing cells or pp2-expressing cells were labeled, because antibodies to opsins essentially label only the outer segments where photopigments are localized, but not the cell bodies or neuronal processes of the photoreceptor cells. we isolated the upstream genomic dna of zebrafish pp <dig>  and pp <dig>  and introduced green fluorescent protein  and red fluorescent protein  into zebrafish under the upstream sequence, respectively. we obtained transgenic zebrafish where gfp and rfp were specifically expressed in the pineal organ . the gfp and rfp exhibited mutually exclusive expression patterns in the transgenic zebrafish pineal organ , which was consistent with the result of the immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies specific for pp <dig> and pp <dig> . the expression patterns of gfp and rfp closely matched those of pp <dig> and pp <dig> mrna revealed by in situ hybridization in the transgenic zebrafish pineal organ, respectively , indicating that these upstream sequences promote specific expression of reporter genes into pp1-expressing and pp2-expresing cells. in the transgenic zebrafish where pp1-expressing cells or pp2-expressing cells were labeled, we detected neuronal processes of pp1-expressing cells, which is consistent with their involvement in pineal wavelength discrimination . however, we rarely detected neuronal processes of pp2-expressing cells , suggesting the possibility that pp2-expressing cells are mainly involved in non-neural responses rather than neural responses like wavelength discrimination.

possible involvement of pp <dig> in melatonin-secretion
it is well established that in non-mammalian vertebrates, pineal organs directly capture light to regulate the secretion of melatonin. this so-called pineal hormone is involved in many physiological functions, such as regulation of locomotor activity and sleep , in addition to neural activities for chromatic and/or achromatic responses. we investigated whether pp2-expressing cells contain serotonin, a precursor of melatonin. immunohistochemical analysis using the anti-serotonin antibody revealed that rfp-labeled pp2-expressing cells contained large amounts of serotonin, whereas gfp-labeled pp1-expressing cells did not . we then introduced rfp or gfp under the promoter sequence of arylalkylamine-n-acetyltransferase- <dig> , the key enzyme involved in synthesizing melatonin from serotonin in the pineal organ, into zebrafish where pp1-expressing cells and pp2-expressing cells were labeled with gfp and rfp, respectively. the results showed that aanat <dig> was expressed in pp2-expressing cells, but not in pp1-expressing cells . furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies for pp <dig> and the red-sensitive cone opsin , which is involved in light-regulated melatonin secretion in various animals  <cit> , revealed that a subset of pp2-expressing cells also expressed lws opsin in the zebrafish pineal organ . in light of the finding that pp <dig> is not a uv-sensitive pigment, these results suggest that in the pineal organ, pp <dig> is involved in light-regulated melatonin secretion with lws opsin, rather than wavelength discrimination involving uv reception.fig.  <dig> serotonin and aanat <dig> localization in pp2-expressing cells analyzed by confocal imaging. distribution of serotonin-containing cells compared to that of a pp1-expressing cells and b pp2-expressing cells in the pineal organ of adult zebrafish. rfp and gfp were introduced under the aanat <dig> promoter into zebrafish where c pp1-expressing cells or d pp2-expressing cells were labeled with gfp or rfp, respectively. the pineal organs of 6-days-post-fertilization larval zebrafish are shown. the scale bars represent  <dig> μm , and  <dig> μm 



spectral tuning mechanism of teleost parapinopsins
it is interesting to investigate the molecular evolution that resulted in non-visual photopigments with distinct spectral sensitivities via tsgd. we analyzed chimeric mutants of pufferfish pp <dig> and pp <dig> because of their high expression level compared to that of other teleost parapinopsin chimeras, in order to obtain a clue to the spectral tuning mechanism of pp <dig> and pp <dig>  spectroscopic analyses of a series of chimeric mutants with respect to the transmembrane helix between pp <dig> and pp <dig> demonstrated that helix ii of pp <dig> is fully responsible for uv sensitivity, and that helices i–iii of pp <dig> are sufficient to make parapinopsin sensitive to visible light . in light of the result that introducing helix iii of pp <dig> alone into pp <dig> did not alter the absorption spectrum , these data suggest an important role for helix ii in the spectral tuning of teleost parapinopsin, although the mutant containing only helix ii of pp <dig> in the background of pp <dig> was not expressed. accumulated mutational analyses revealed that the main site  <dig> , as well as other sites in helices i to iii , play crucial roles in the spectral tuning of uv-sensitive cone opsins   <cit> . on the other hand, in fruit fly uv-sensitive visual opsin , the site equivalent to site  <dig> in helix ii of bovine rhodopsin, site  <dig>  determines the spectral shift between uv-sensitive and blue-sensitive opsins  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the contributions of site  <dig>  which is occupied by val, cys, and thr in the gar parapinopsin, pp1s and pp2s, respectively, and site  <dig>  which is occupied by thr, phe or cys and thr in the gar parapinopsin, pp1s and pp2s, respectively . we found no significant spectral changes in teleost parapinopsins in these mutants compared to wild type . these results suggest that the spectral tuning mechanism of teleost parapinopsins is different from those used by vertebrate sws <dig> opsins and fruit fly uv-sensitive visual opsins, even though the importance of helix ii is similar in all three of these uv pigments .fig.  <dig> analyses of chimeric mutants of pufferfish parapinopsin, indicating the importance of helix ii in the spectral tuning of teleost parapinopsin. a–d absorption spectra of chimeric mutants  composed of pufferfish pp <dig> and pp <dig> helices . mutants containing helices i and ii of pp <dig> and helices iii–vii of pp <dig> , and the mutant containing only helix ii of pp <dig> in the background of pp <dig>  exhibit their absorption maximum in the uv region. the mutant containing helices i–iii of pp <dig> and helices iv–vii of pp <dig>  exhibits absorption in the visible region, whereas the mutant containing only helix iii of pp <dig> and helices i, ii, iv–vii of pp <dig>  remains a uv-sensitive pigment. e comparison of the amino acid sequences of helix ii among teleost parapinopsins. the horizontal bar on the alignment indicates helix ii. sites  <dig> and  <dig> in the parapinopsins are highlighted. note that mutants containing only helix i of pp <dig> in the background of pp <dig> or helices i and/or ii of pp <dig> in the background of pp <dig> were not expressed



discussion
in this study, we identified two types of parapinopsins, pp <dig> and pp <dig>  in three kinds of teleosts, and characterized their functions. we found clear differences between pp <dig> and pp2; pp <dig> is a uv-sensitive pigment, like the lamprey and iguana parapinopsins  <cit> , but unexpectedly, pp <dig> is not uv-sensitive and is a novel blue-sensitive parapinopsin , which shows the diversification of non-visual opsins with respect to spectral sensitivity. our phylogenetic and synteny analyses suggested that pp <dig> and pp <dig> are derived from tsgd  <cit> . furthermore, we have clearly shown that the parapinopsin of spotted gar, which diverged before tsgd  <cit> , is a uv-sensitive pigment . in addition, based on the fact that the parapinopsins of other vertebrates are also uv-sensitive pigments, we can infer that the blue-sensitive parapinopsin evolved from a uv-sensitive parapinopsin. it is of interest to discuss how the functional differentiations between pp <dig> and pp <dig> occurred. in the phylogenetic tree, the branch length between the gene duplication and the deepest node in teleost pp <dig>  is more than three-fold longer than that between the gene duplication and the deepest node in teleost pp <dig> , suggesting a higher accumulation rate of amino acid substitutions in the course of pp <dig> evolution. on the other hand, sequence comparison of transmembrane helices, which are involved in spectral tuning, between the uv-sensitive parapinopsin group, including the spotted gar parapinopsin, teleost pp1s and other vertebrate parapinopsins, and the teleost pp <dig> group did not reveal any positions occupied by group-specific amino acid residues with different physicochemical properties other than site  <dig> . judging from the observation that no significant spectral changes occurred owing to substitutions of amino acid residue at site  <dig> in pufferfish and zebrafish parapinopsins, multiple amino acid residues, which might be species specific, could be involved in the spectral tuning of parapinopsins. further mutational analyses including other teleost parapinopsins could reveal a novel spectral tuning mechanism between uv-sensitive and visible-light-sensitive pigments.

we also found that pp <dig> and pp <dig> were expressed in different pineal cells in three teleost species belonging to phylogenetically distant teleost orders . these results strongly suggest that the differences in both the molecular properties and expression profiles between pp <dig> and pp <dig> are common in teleosts. furthermore, our characterization of pp1-expressing and pp2-expressing cells in the zebrafish pineal organs revealed that pp <dig> can be considered a uv-sensitive pigment involved in pineal wavelength discrimination, but, conversely, pp <dig> is likely involved in light-regulated melatonin secretion .

we emphasize that the teleost pp <dig> is a uv-sensitive photopigment  and its pineal expression is conserved in three kinds of teleosts, including rainbow trout, which has the pineal wavelength discrimination ability  <cit>  . accordingly, it is strongly suggested that pp <dig> underlies uv reception for pineal wavelength discrimination in teleosts. taken together with the involvement of parapinopsins in uv reception in the lamprey pineal organ and iguana parietal eye  <cit> , current findings strengthen the idea that uv-sensitive parapinopsin is a fundamental molecule for wavelength discrimination involving uv reception in the pineal and related organs of non-mammalian vertebrates.

light-regulated melatonin secretion is the primary function of pineal organs and has therefore been well investigated thus far. however, the underlying photopigments has been largely uncertain in teleosts. we have demonstrated that zebrafish pp2-expressing pineal cells contain serotonin and aanat <dig>  and some of them also express lws opsin, which has been shown to be involved in light-regulated melatonin secretion in the lamprey and chicken  <cit>  . these results suggest that pp <dig> and lws opsin are strong candidates for the light sensor for regulation of melatonin secretion in teleosts. in fact, the combination of pp <dig> and lws opsin is consistent with a previous observation, showing that a broad visible light ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nm influences melatonin secretion in zebrafish pineal organs  <cit> . this is similar to the case of the chicken pineal organ, where the blue-sensitive pigment pinopsin and lws opsin are suggested to be involved in melatonin secretion  <cit> . interestingly, teleosts with pp <dig> do not possess pinopsin in their genomes whereas the spotted gar, which does not contain pp <dig>  has pinopsin. these observations lead us to speculate that blue light might be suitable for the regulation of melatonin secretion, with the evolution of pp <dig> potentially being related to the loss of pinopsin in teleosts. accordingly, our findings provide a clear-cut example for functional differentiation among paralogs; the teleost pp <dig> could have retained the putative ancestral function, whereas teleost pp <dig> acquired a novel functional role via a neofunctionalization event.

CONCLUSIONS
recent genome projects of many animals have revealed that non-visual opsins have undergone a number of diversifications. however, the functional meaning of these diversifications remain unclear, in contrast to those of visual opsins, which diversified in spectral sensitivity to enable color vision and other visual function . in this paper, we have clearly shown the differences in the molecular properties of duplicated non-visual opsins, by demonstrating the diversification of parapinopsin with respect to spectral sensitivity, which generated a blue-sensitive parapinopsin from the original uv-sensitive parapinopsin. moreover, we also showed a plausible link between this diversification and its physiological consequences; this diversification could allow parapinopsin to contribute to the light regulation of melatonin secretion, in addition to wavelength discrimination. current findings that two parapinopsins with different spectral sensitivities could contribute to different pineal functions  also provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of the “color” preferences of non-visual photoreception.
