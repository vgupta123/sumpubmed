BACKGROUND
rice is a salt-sensitive cereal crop. high salinity may cause delayed seed germination, slow seedling growth, and reduced rate of seed set, leading to decreased rice yield. these disorders are generally due to the combined effects of ion imbalance, hyperosmotic stress, and oxidative damage. in the early period, rice can rapidly perceive a salt stress signal via plasma membrane receptors in root cells and can rapidly initiate an intracellular signal that modulates gene expression to elicit an adaptive response.

functional genomics is an effective tool for identifying new genes, determining gene expression patterns in response to salt stress, and understanding their functions in stress adaptation. initially, gene expression is examined at the mrna level using large-scale screening techniques such as cdna microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression, and cdna-amplified fragment-length polymorphism. cdna microarrays containing  <dig> cdnas were used to analyze gene expression profiles during the initial phase of salt stress in rice roots, and found that approximately 10% of the transcripts in pokkali were significantly upregulated or downregulated within  <dig> h of salt stress  <cit> . to date, cdna microarray analyses have identified approximately  <dig> salt-responsive unigenes in shoots of the highly salt-tolerant rice variety, nona bokra, and most of them were not known to be involved in salt stress  <cit> . in addition, forward and reverse genetics have identified gene functions during salt stress. interestingly, map-based cloning was used to isolate a rice quantitative trait loci gene, skc <dig> that encoded an hkt-type transporter selective for na+. analysis of transgenic rice plants with loss-of-function or gain-of-function phenotypes that were changed by forward and reverse genetics revealed that skc <dig> was involved in regulating k+/na+ homeostasis under salt stress  <cit> . also, in arabidopsis, overexpression of sos <dig>  which encoded a plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter, improved salt tolerance  <cit> .

recently, proteome profiles of rice in response to salt stress were presented for various tissues or organs such as roots, leaf lamina, leaf sheaths and young panicles  <cit> . although some differential proteins of interest have been identified, little is known about the functions of these proteins.

here, oscyp <dig>  a salt-induced rice cyclophilin, was separated and identified by 2-de, maldi-tof ms and esi-ms/ms. oscyp <dig> had peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase  activity that was specifically inhibited by cyclosporine a  <cit> . moreover, oscyp <dig> lacks introns, and the 5' end of transcript contains an at-rich region, suggesting that oscyp <dig> was likely to be preferentially translated during stress conditions  <cit> . actually, oscyp <dig> could respond to multiple environmental stresses such as high salt, drought, heat and oxidative stress. for example, heterologous expression of oscyp <dig> was able to enhance ability of e. coli to survive, to complement the yeast mutant lacking native oscyp <dig> and to improve the growth of wild type yeast under the above mentioned abiotic stresses  <cit> . in addition, significantly differential changes in transcript abundance of oscyp <dig> were found in shoots of salt sensitive  and tolerant  rice cultivars at different developmental stages under normal and salt stress conditions  <cit> .

we have therefore focused on the effect of oscyp <dig> expression on salt tolerance in rice seedlings. overexpression of oscyp <dig> conferred salt tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings. although oscyp2-transgenic seedlings did not predominate over wild-type seedlings in ion homeostasis  and osmotic regulation , they displayed lower levels of lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings, suggesting that the involvement of oscyp <dig> in the response of rice seedling to salt stress is required, but also it can enhance salt tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings by controlling ros levels. in addition to salt stress, oscyp <dig> can respond to other types of stresses, such as drought, heat and cold, indicating that oscyp <dig> is likely to act as a general integrator of environmental stresses.

RESULTS
evaluation of the salt tolerance of two rice hybrid varieties
to compare the salt tolerance of the two rice hybrid varieties, shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu, relative length and dry weight of shoots and roots were determined after exposure to salt stress, respectively. the roots and shoots of shanyou  <dig> were longer and heavier than those of liangyoupeijiu . phenotypic analysis showed that shanyou  <dig> seedlings grew faster than liangyoupeijiu seedlings under salt stress conditions , suggesting that shanyou  <dig> seedlings were relatively more tolerant to salt.

separation and identification of differentially expressed salt-responsive proteins of rice seedlings
to understand the differences between shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu at the protein expression level, 2-de and ms were used to separate and identify differentially expressed salt-responsive proteins of rice seedlings in shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu. more than  <dig> rice shoot proteins  were detected by image match analysis. of these,  <dig> proteins were up- or downregulated in response to salt stress. nine upregulated proteins consistently showed significant and reproducible increases in abundance  under nacl stress  and were selected for maldi-tof ms analysis. they were identified as a putative glutathione s-transferase, manganese superoxide dismutase, dehydroascorbate reductase , a putative phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , putative l-aspartate oxidase , putative cold shock protein- <dig>  prohibitin , a putative membrane protein , a putative oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 3- <dig>  and cyclophilin  <dig> .

oscyp <dig>  was predicted to encode a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> .in the conserved region of oscyp <dig>  the residues his- <dig>  arg- <dig>  phe- <dig>  gln- <dig>  phe- <dig>  trp- <dig> and his- <dig> appeared to be associated with ppiase catalysis. three of these, including his- <dig>  arg- <dig> and phe- <dig>  are most essential for ppiase activity of oscyp <dig>  the residue trp- <dig> is a binding site of oscyp <dig> with immunosuppressant cyclosporin a . oscyp <dig> had significant homology with other known cyclophilins from various plant species . the deduced amino acid sequence of oscyp <dig> displayed higher identity with the cyclophilins of three cereal crops, t. aestivum, zea mays and sorghum bicolor , while oscyp <dig> showed relatively lower identity with three cyclophilins of arabidopsis, including atcyp19- <dig> , atcyp20- <dig>  and atcyp20- <dig> . moreover, a closer relationship between oscyp <dig> and the cyclophilins of three cereal crops was observed compared to arabidopsis .

phenotypic identification of oscyp <dig> transgenic rice seedlings under salt stress
to understand the response of transgenic rice seedlings with oscyp <dig> overexpression to salt stress, we introduced this gene into wild-type rice  to obtain t <dig> transgenic seedlings with single copy insertion . ten-day-old transgenic and wild-type seedlings were treated with  <dig> mm nacl. after  <dig> days, leaves of wild-type seedlings exhibited the chlorotic phenotype, and in some cases died, whereas leaves of the transgenic seedlings remained green . similar phenotypes were observed in three-week-old wild type and transgenic seedlings treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> d under water culture . significantly, two transgenic lines  showed oscyp <dig> overexpression under normal condition compared to wild-type . although oscyp <dig> expression was inhibited in two transgenic lines and was induced in wild type under salt stress, salt-stressed seedlings of two transgenic lines showed close or higher levels of oscyp <dig> expression to or than that of wild type . similarly, two transgenic lines showed higher levels of ppiase activity under normal condition compared to wild type. salt-stressed seedlings of wild type exhibited higher level of ppiase activity than unstressed seedlings, while no significant changes in levels of ppiase activity were found between salt-stressed and unstressed seedlings of two transgenic lines. salt-stressed seedlings of two transgenic lines still kept close or higher levels of ppiase activity to or than that of wild type . the addition of csa significantly suppressed the ppiase activity of wild type and two transgenic lines . therefore, it was suggested that oscyp <dig> was likely to play an important role in the response of rice seedlings to salt stress.

effect of salt stress on maximal photochemical efficiency  of oscyp <dig> transgenic rice seedlings
based on the observation that the oscyp2-transgenic seedlings retained green color in their leaves, we speculated that oscyp <dig> was likely to protect the photosynthetic components in rice leaves from oxidative stress caused by salt. we compared the effects of salt stress on the maximal photochemical efficiency  in oscyp <dig> transgenic and wild-type seedlings. salt stress significantly reduced the fv/fm in wild-type seedlings, but no significant change was observed in fv/fm for oscyp <dig> transgenic seedlings , suggesting that oscyp <dig> over-expression protected the photosynthetic components in rice leaves against oxidative stress.

effect of salt stress on lipid peroxidation and ros scavenging in oscyp <dig> transgenic rice seedlings
to further validate the protective effects of oscyp <dig> on the photosynthesis machinery in rice leaves, we compared salt stress-induced changes in the lipid peroxidation product  and ros scavenging in oscyp2-transgenic and wild-type seedlings. the level of mda in plant tissues was used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation  <cit> . under normal conditions , the mda levels were lower in oscyp2-transgenic seedlings than in wild-type seedlings . by comparison, under salt stress , the mda levels were significantly reduced in oscyp2-transgenic seedlings, whereas the mda levels increased in wild-type seedlings , indicating that oscyp <dig> over-expression could decrease lipid peroxidation levels in transgenic rice seedlings.

stress-induced h2o <dig> accumulation could increase lipid peroxidation  <cit> . under normal conditions, oscyp2-transgenic rice seedlings contained lower h2o <dig> levels than wild-type seedlings. at  <dig> h after treatment with  <dig> mm nacl, each type of seedlings exhibited a decrease in h2o <dig> levels . similarly, the h2o <dig> levels in oscyp2-transgenic rice seedlings were lower than that in wild-type seedlings.

accumulation of h2o <dig> was accompanied by changes in ros scavenging enzyme activities  <cit> . here, we compared salt stress-induced alterations in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase , catalase  and ascorbate peroxidase  in oscyp <dig> transgenic and wild-type seedlings. salt treatment increased the activities of these enzymes in oscyp <dig> transgenic seedlings to varying degrees . for wild-type seedlings, cat activity increased  but the activities of sod and apx decreased in response to salt stress.

expression pattern of oscyp <dig> in hybrid rice seedlings
to better understand oscyp <dig> function, we utilized rt-pcr to detect temporal and spatial expression patterns of oscyp <dig> in hybrid rice seedlings. based on the data in figure 7a, it appeared that the oscyp <dig> expression in roots was less than that in shoots. oscyp <dig> expression was strongly induced by salt stress . at different time points  after salt treatment , oscyp <dig> exhibited circadian rhythm expression as time went. maximal oscyp <dig> expression occurred at  <dig> h in shanyou  <dig> seedlings and at  <dig> h in liangyoupeijiu seedlings, whereas minimal oscyp <dig> expression occurred at  <dig> h in shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu seedlings . another peak of oscyp <dig> expression appeared at  <dig> h in shanyou  <dig> seedlings but not significantly in liangyoupeijiu seedlings. interestingly, shanyou  <dig> seedlings showed higher maximal oscyp <dig> expression than liangyoupeijiu seedlings . in addition to salt stress, oscyp <dig> expression was affected by other types of stresses-peg, heat, cold, or aba. in shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu seedlings, oscyp <dig> expression was induced by peg and heat but inhibited by cold . aba slightly induced expression in shanyou  <dig> seedlings but inhibited expression in liangyoupeijiu seedlings. generally, shanyou  <dig> seedlings showed higher oscyp <dig> expression than liangyoupeijiu seedlings under the above mentioned stresses.

discussion
the amino acid sequence alignment shows that oscyp <dig> is likely to have peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase  activity, which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of the amide bond between a proline residue and the preceding residue, and functions as a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding, and refolding of denatured proteins. oscyp <dig> possesses seven residues, including his- <dig>  arg- <dig>  phe- <dig>  gln- <dig>  phe- <dig>  trp- <dig> and his- <dig> that show to be associated with ppiase catalysis. three of these, including his- <dig>  arg- <dig> and phe- <dig>  are most essential for ppiase activity of oscyp <dig>  the residue trp- <dig> is a site binding to cyclosporin a. seven residues were also found in atcyp20- <dig> that had the ppiase activity. in our study, two transgenic lines with oscyp <dig> overexpression maintain higher levels of total ppiase activity compared to wild type. the addition of csa is able to reduce total ppiase activity of both wild type and two transgenic lines. although it has been demonstrated by heterologous expression that oscyp <dig> possessed ppiase activity  <cit> , our findings provide powerful evidence at in vivo level to validate it.

the mechanisms of plant response or tolerance to salt stress can fall into three categories: tolerance to osmotic stress, na+ exclusion from leaf blades and tissue tolerance  <cit> . osmotic stress response is the first phase that plant responds to salt stress, resulting in the decrease in the rate of leaf growth and rate of photosynthesis. the reduced rate of photosynthesis accelerates the formation of ros, and increases the activity of enzymes that detoxify ros  <cit> . these enzymes include sod, apx, cat, and the various peroxidases  <cit> . the coordinated activity of the multiple forms of these enzymes in the different cell compartments maintain a balance between the rate of formation and removal of ros, and control h2o <dig> at the levels required for cell signaling. ionic stresses occur at a later stage, which then leads to senescence of mature leaves. the main site of na+ toxicity for most plants is the leaf blade, where na+ accumulates after being deposited in the transpiration stream rather than in the roots  <cit> . most na+ that is transported to the shoot remains in the shoot, because for most plants, the movement of na+ from the shoot to the roots in the phloem can likely recirculate only a small amount of the na+ that is transported to the shoot  <cit> . therefore, na+ accumulation in the shoot is dependent on the net delivery of na+ into the root xylem. interestingly, several genes that are involved in controlling the net delivery of na+ into the root xylem have been identified. the plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter, sos <dig>  is expressed in stelar cells and could be involved in the efflux of na+ from stelar cells into the xylem  <cit> . meanwhile, sos <dig> has also been implicated in retrieval of na+ from the xylem  <cit> . moreover, there is much evidence showing that some members of the high-affinity k+ transporter  gene family play important role in retrieval of na+ from the xylem. athkt1; <dig>  a member of arabidopsis hkt gene family, that is involved in the retrieval of na+ from the xylem before it reaches the shoot  <cit> . a similar function for the closely related hkt1; <dig> gene family has been identified in rice  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . unlike sos <dig> or members of hkt gene family, oscyp <dig>  encodes a rice cyclophilin, inferring that it is likely to function as a molecular chaperone that is involved in protein folding. over-expression of oscyp <dig> confers salt tolerance in rice. however, higher leaf or root k+/na+ ratio was not shown in oscyp <dig> transgenic seedlings under salt stress as compared to wild type , suggesting that oscyp <dig> is not implicated in na+ accumulation and transport in rice seedlings. similarly, oscyp <dig> transgenic seedlings displayed lower free proline level than wild type , indicating that oscyp <dig> does not play a role in osmotic protection of rice seedlings against salt stress. interestingly, wild-type seedlings exhibited a marked reduction in maximal photochemical efficiency under salt stress, whereas no such change was observed for oscyp2-transgenic seedlings. oscyp2-transgenic seedlings had lower levels of lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings. however, no significant correlations were found between gene expression level and activity level of antioxidant enzymes . it is suggested that h2o <dig> levels are controlled by oscyp <dig> up-regulating the activities of sod, cat, and apx at post-translation level, not at transcription level, thus resulting in reduced mda level. this, in turn, protected photosynthesis components of rice leaves against oxidative stress by maintaining the activity of psii. therefore, oscyp <dig> may be a key regulator that controls ros level by modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes at translation level.

here, our results show that oscyp <dig> plays a key role in preventing oxidative damage to photosystems. generally, the two processes that avoid photoinhibition owing to excess light are heat dissipation by the xanthophyll pigments and electron transfer to oxygen acceptors other than water. the latter response necessitates the upregulation of key enzymes for regulating ros levels such as sod, apx, cat, and the various peroxidases  <cit> . obviously, the above knowledge leads us to infer that oscyp <dig> may be implicated in the process of electron transfer to oxygen acceptors. however, sufficient evidence is still lacking, further studies are needed to address this possibility.

in this study, oscyp <dig> expression is induced by salt stress. interestingly, oscyp <dig> shows circadian rhythm expression as time goes. as a result, we speculate that response of oscyp <dig> to salt stress is likely to be regulated by circadian rhythm. moreover, circadian rhythm expression of oscyp <dig> in shanyou  <dig>  a salt-tolerant hybrid variety, occurs earlier than that in liangyoupeijiu, a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, suggesting earlier response of oscyp <dig> to salt stress is likely to be associated with salt tolerance of rice seedlings. in addition to salt stress, oscyp <dig> expression is affected by other types of stresses-peg, heat, or aba induced expression in shanyou  <dig> seedlings but inhibited expression in liangyoupeijiu seedlings. in addition, cold stress inhibits oscyp <dig> expression in shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu seedlings.these data suggest that oscyp <dig> expression is not specific in salt stress, but is ubiquitous in the response of rice seedlings to other types of stresses, including drought, heat and cold. importantly, the above conclusion is consistent with the previous findings that oscyp <dig> can respond to various stresses including high salt, drought, heat, oxidative stress and hypoxia stress  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that oscyp <dig> may function as a key integrator in response to multiple stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative proteomics identified a rice cyclophilin, oscyp <dig> that is up-regulated during salt-induced stress. over-expression of oscyp <dig> confers salt tolerance in rice. under salt stress, oscyp <dig> is likely to up-regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes  at post-translation level to control h2o <dig> levels, resulting in reduced mda levels, which may prevent oxidative damage to photosystems. unfortunately, oscyp <dig> is not implicated in na+ accumulation and transport and osmotic protection in rice seedlings. oscyp <dig> expression is not only induced by salt stress, but also regulated by circadian rhythm. moreover, oscyp <dig> is also likely to act as a key component that is involved in signal pathways of other type of stresses-peg, heat, cold, or aba.
