BACKGROUND
the innate immune system is the first line of host defence against pathogens and is activated by host recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns . these engage families of pattern-recognition receptors  that include the toll-like receptors   <cit> . the tlrs form an ancient gene group which is found in invertebrates and vertebrates and there are related genes in plants  <cit> . in vertebrates, six tlr families of common ancestry and similar recognition patterns have been identified. the tlr <dig> family consists of tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and is involved in the recognition of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . tlr <dig> and  <dig> form heterodimers with tlr <dig>  a crucial process for identification of several pamps  <cit> . tlr <dig> recognises both tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides whereas tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> recognise tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides, respectively  <cit> . in mammals at least ten of these tlr genes have been described, each binding different pamps representing a wide range of pathogens.

the tlrs consist of a large extracellular domain responsible for pamp binding, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain which binds signalling molecules and initiates innate cellular immune responses  <cit> .

the extracellular domains are composed of approximately  <dig> leucine-rich repeats , motifs of 20– <dig> amino acids  in length, forming a solenoid shape and potentially binding the tlr specific patterns. tlr <dig> binds its ligands either on its concave or convex surfaces  <cit> .

the concave surface is formed by a highly conserved segment  consisting of  <dig> or  <dig> aa, normally following a pattern lxxlxlxxnxl or lxxlxlxxcxxl. the convex side is shaped by α-helical elements from the aas of the variable segment   <cit> . the tir domain interacts with adapter proteins that direct the intracellular signalling cascade after tlr-pamp engagement. substitutions within the tir domain, particularly in the bb loop have been shown to impact on receptor signalling  <cit> , while mutagenesis of the dd loop identified residues essential for tlr1/ <dig> dimerisation  <cit> .

due to their central role in host defence, polymorphisms within tlr genes are associated with predisposition to a range of diseases in humans and mice. accumulating evidence suggests that polymorphism in tlr genes is also associated with variations in disease resistance traits in livestock  <cit> . an arg753gln polymorphism in tlr <dig> has been associated with a predisposition to staphylococcal infection  <cit> , tuberculosis  <cit> , rheumatic fever  <cit>  and urinary tract infection in children  <cit> . tlrs are under strong selection for both maintenance and adaptation of function  <cit> . the intracellular tir domain is highly conserved with functional similarity among species and tlr genes, as it is involved in engaging signalling pathways within cells  <cit> . however, the extracellular tlr domains exhibit significantly-higher divergence reflecting their involvement in pamp recognition from multiple microbial sources. amino acid changes are concentrated in the region between lrr <dig> and lrr <dig>  that is important for pamp ligand binding  <cit> . tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> phylogeny is also driven by co-evolution caused by gene conversion which could also affect their heterodimerisation  <cit> .

protein evolution is shaped by divergent selection pressures on sites of different functional relevance. this process can be reproduced by phylogeny-based models of codon substitution which are based on a site-by-site analysis of the non-synonymous /synonymous  substitution ratio  between sequences  <cit> . in many cases protein function is maintained against occurring disadvantageous mutations by purifying selection resulting in high conservation of such sites or domains . in contrast, the adaptive evolution of protein function can be driven by positive selection of advantageous mutations at functionally-important sites . this has been observed in genes involved in immune responses to pathogens, not just particularly the mhc complex  <cit> , but also in toll-like receptor genes  <cit> .

such phylogeny-based models can offer a valuable tool to predict sites of putative functional relevance  <cit> . however, it is also possible that sites with high ω might reflect ancient adaptive selection and the functional relevance of certain sites could have changed with the adaptation process  <cit> .

in this study, we take advantage of a phylogeny based approach to identify bovine tlr <dig> polymorphisms revealed by analysing the gene in ten predominant bos indicus and bos taurus cattle breeds. through the analysis of the tlr <dig> phylogeny in a set of mammalian species we will estimate the selective pressure on individual bovine tlr <dig> sites and domains. to detect variations in selective constraint during evolution caused by possible functional changes we will compare our results with a subset of tlr <dig> sequences from ruminants only.

RESULTS
tlr <dig> sequences and domain structure
the length of the predicted tlr <dig> proteins in all species analysed ranged between  <dig> –  <dig> aas. in all species, tlr <dig> shared a common domain architecture: an extra-cellular domain containing  <dig> leucine rich repeats between aa <dig> and aa <dig>  a transmembrane domain at aa585–aa <dig> and an intracellular tir domain at aa633–aa <dig> 

selective constraint and sequence conservation
in some domains of tlr <dig> sequence variation  was high, particularly in the region between aa <dig> and aa <dig>  comprising lrr 7– <dig>  most of the other domains were more conserved, particularly lrr  <dig> and lrr  <dig>  and the tir domain .

to interpret these results with respect to domain and aa-specific selective constraint, the sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood . the average ω over the whole tlr <dig> protein using data from all the mammalian sequences was  <dig> . the model assigned all aa sites into three classes of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sites with an average ω of:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and average probabilities for the class allocation of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. amino acid sites in the latter class are likely to be under positive selection if their ω is >  <dig> with high probability. this is true for  <dig> out of the  <dig> aa sites in this class with at least 95% probability .

position: position in the protein sequence, aa: amino acid at this position in cattle, p: probability of class assignment as positively selected site, ω: dn/ds ratio

the ω in the extracellular domain were mostly higher than those in the intracellular domains . the most divergent regions were between aa11–aa <dig> , aa241–aa <dig> , aa268–aa <dig>  and aa294–aa <dig>  with average ω of the surrounding  <dig> aa of >  <dig> . in the region between aa296–aa <dig>  nine of the  <dig> aa are significantly under positive selection  with ω over  <dig>  for all of them.

the highest conserved regions of the extracellular domain were at aa348–aa <dig> , aa482–aa <dig>  and aa534–aa <dig>  with average ω of the surrounding  <dig> aa smaller than  <dig> . in these regions there were also several interspersed sites that were likely to evolve under positive selection with p >  <dig>  .

the tlr <dig> intracellular domains were generally much more conserved through strong purifying selection, reaching maximum conservation in the tir domain with ω <  <dig>  for the vast majority of sites. nevertheless, interspersed within this highly conserved domain several aa sites were assigned to class  <dig> with high probabilities  suggesting that they are under positive selection . a list of class assignment and probabilities for all aa sites is provided in the additional file 2: class assignment of aa sites.

taxon-specific selected sites
ruminant-specific ω  were very similar to those estimated in the dataset that included all mammalian species analysed . nevertheless, selective constraint appears to have acted differently on some aas and domains. forty-four aa sites in ruminants were assigned to class  <dig> ,  <dig> to class  <dig> and none to class  <dig>  with only  <dig> positively-selected aa sites as significant . from the  <dig> class  <dig> aa sites in ruminants,  <dig> were assigned to class  <dig> in all mammals. only  <dig> sites were assigned to the same class of selective constraint in ruminants as well as in all mammals.  <dig> aa sites differed by one class  and one site differed by two classes  in ruminants versus all mammals .

selective pressure has acted differentially on several domains of the ruminant tlr <dig> than in mammals in general . eight lrr domains, lrr <dig> : - <dig> ), lrr <dig> , lrr <dig> , lrr <dig> , lrr <dig> , lrr <dig> , lrr <dig>  and lrr <dig> , were more conserved within ruminants than within all mammalian species studied. this contrasted with lrr <dig> ,  <dig>  and tir , which were more diverse within ruminants when compared to the complete mammalian species dataset .

phylogenetic trees of tlr <dig> in mammals
all constructed trees reflect, in general, the putative evolution of the analysed species. however, two exceptions to this generalisation were observed: a closer relationship between capra ibex and ovis aries than between capra ibex and capra hircus and a closer relationship between boselaphus tragocamelus and bos taurus than between bubalus bubalis and bos taurus.

trees based on synonymous exchanges clustered equally to those based on non-synonymous exchanges . nevertheless, they differed in relative branch lengths indicating branch specific rates of evolutionary change of the tlr <dig> protein sequence. this was reflected in different ω along branches . specifically, along most  branches the tlr <dig> sequence evolved under similar selective pressure and with ω between  <dig> – <dig> . in four branches however, low ω  indicated low evolutionary change , while in  <dig> branches high ω  were generated by relatively very high numbers of non-synonymous exchanges.

branches evolving under positive selection
seven of the  <dig> branches with high ω were short with less than  <dig>  exchanges per codon . their evolutionary rate is consequently difficult to assess and could have been caused by chance. these branches are therefore not further considered here. three further branches with high ω were much longer and suggested an accelerated evolutionary rate caused by positive selection on certain domains.

a first branch had a ω of  <dig>  and represented the evolution of the common ancestor of ungulata to the common ancestor of artiodactyla . this ratio was based on  <dig> non-synonymous exchanges between both ancestral sequences of which  <dig> are within lrr, three within the transmembrane domain and one within the tir domain . twenty-five of these aa sites displayed high ω and were assigned to aa site class  <dig>  in the complete dataset, but only five were assigned to site class  <dig> in the ruminant set of sequences. all remaining  <dig> aa sites assigned to class  <dig> in all mammals studied were assigned to class  <dig> in the ruminants.

a further branch separated bovine ruminants  from small ruminants, giraffa camelopardalis and all non-ruminants . it had a ω of  <dig>  and was based on ten exchanges affecting aas, of which seven were located within lrrs, one in the transmembrane domain, and one in the tir domain . five of these  <dig> affected sites were classified as class  <dig>  in the complete dataset. using the ruminant dataset, eight were classified as class  <dig> aa sites, of which four had intermediate ω  in the complete dataset. only one aa site was assigned to class  <dig> in the complete dataset, but to class  <dig> in the ruminant dataset. in contrast to all other branches, this bovine branch was based on exchanges affecting aa sites which were specifically under positive selection in ruminants, but not in the complete mammalian dataset.

the third branch, separating ovis aries and capra ibex  from the other ruminants  had a ω of  <dig>  and affected six aas, all of which were located within the first  <dig> aas of the extracellular domain . four of these aa sites were assigned to aa site class  <dig> in the complete dataset and three in the set of sequences limited to ruminants. one aa site assigned to class  <dig> overall was assigned to class  <dig> in the ruminant dataset.

branches based on abundant or unevenly distributed exchanges
a further three branches had average ω, but displayed a noteworthy number of substitutions or a remarkable bias of distribution of the exchanges over the protein sequence .

the first of these branches connected the common ancestor of artiodactyla  with the common ancestor of the ruminants . it had a ω of  <dig>  and consisted of  <dig> exchanges, of which  <dig> were assigned to class  <dig> in the complete dataset, but only eight to class  <dig> in the ruminant set of sequences. forty-one aa sites assigned to class  <dig> in the complete dataset were assigned to class  <dig> in the ruminant dataset.

the second branch separated the common ancestor of ruminants  from the bovidae . it had a ω of  <dig>  and contained seven exchanges, of which five were assigned to class  <dig> in the complete dataset and four to class  <dig> in the ruminant dataset. one changed from class  <dig> in the complete dataset to class  <dig> in the ruminant dataset. all these exchanges were located in the n-terminal half of the protein between aa101–aa <dig> 

the third branch separating the common ancestor of the bovidae  from small ruminants  had a ratio of  <dig>  based on  <dig> exchanges. in contrast to most of the tlr <dig> aa sites in ruminants, most of these exchanges were classified as probably positively-selected  in both sequence sets, even those located in the normally highly conserved tir domain. three aa sites changed from a class  <dig> assignment in the complete dataset to a class  <dig> assignment in ruminants and one from a class  <dig> assignment in the complete dataset to a class  <dig> assignment in the ruminant dataset. all of these exchanges were located in the c-terminal half of the protein between aa508–aa <dig>  with more than half of them located in the highly-conserved tir domain.

polymorphism in bovine tlr <dig> and detection of polymorphic aa sites under positive selection
sequencing of dna pools containing amplified tlr <dig> coding regions of  <dig> cattle breeds revealed  <dig> polymorphic sites in the nucleotide sequence. one of these has been reported previously . they result in  <dig> yet unreported polymorphic aa sites in the bovine tlr <dig> . sixteen of them were located in lrr domains, one in the transmembrane domain and three in the tir domain. ten involved exchanges between aas which occurred rarely on a genome scale with a blosum <dig> score of  <dig> or lower, indicating that these exchanges were likely to have functional effects. nine of the non-synonymous snps were assigned to the site class likely to be positively-selected when comparing the sequences of all analysed mammals. only six of these fitted this category when comparing sequences within ruminants. all these six exchanges in ruminants have a blosum <dig> score of  <dig> or lower, again indicating a higher likelihood of functional effects.

nucleotide: position of the polymorphism in the nucleotide sequence, amino acid: affected amino acid site, domain: domain in which the polymorphic site is located, lrrct: leucine rich repeat c-terminal domain, mem: transmembrane domain, blosum62: blosum <dig> matrix score of the particular aa exchange, p : probablitiy of class assignment in the complete dataset, class : class assignment in the complete dataset , class : class assignment in the ruminant subset, dbsnp_id : accession number in dbsnp database, aa: aberdeen angus, fb: fighting bull, bp: black pied gene reserve, ga: german angus, fv: fleckvieh, hf: holstein friesian, li: limousin, ne: nelore, sw: sahiwal, bh: brahman. the last three breeds are bos indicus breeds.

four of the  <dig> non-synonymous substitutions were fixed in all breeds analysed, two of them  with sahiwal breed-specific aas, one with a fixed exchange which was present only in the spanish fighting bull  and a fourth one with a fixed exchange present only in the german black pied . three mutations at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were specific to bos indicus with all taurine breeds fixed for the wildtype.

discussion
patterns of selective constraint on tlr <dig> ligand binding, dimerisation & aas involved in signalling
the evolution of the mammalian tlr <dig> gene has been shaped by positive and purifying selection . sequence variation at aa sites responsible for pattern recognition  will have enabled a faster adaptation to new pathogens as they are encountered in different geographical locations or as they newly emerge in a habitat. this has clear selective advantages. such advantageous substitutions have spread faster in the populations analysed than random substitutions. they appear concentrated in the extracellular region of tlr <dig>  particularly in the lrrs 8– <dig> in which residues responsible for ligand binding have recently been reported  <cit> . in contrast aas responsible for functions like heterodimerisation or signalling were more conserved, presumably because the interacting molecules require conserved aa binding sites. amino acids essential for tlr <dig> dimerisation with tlr <dig> in human and mouse have been identified in the lrrs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the tir domain  <cit>  . our results show that, with the exception of lrr <dig>  all these regions were under strong purifying selection whereas lrr <dig> and  <dig> were amongst the most conserved regions of the extracellular domain. the tir domain was the most conserved domain of the protein, which is known to be conserved even among tlr paralogs  <cit> . in human and mouse tlr <dig>  jin et al.  <cit>  identified both ligand binding and tlr <dig> heterodimerisation sites within lrr <dig> . according to our assumptions, this would lead to opposed selective pressures on different aa sites within the same domain. this was in fact observed and resulted in an overall average ω for this lrr in bovine tlr <dig> 

we have assumed in this study that many of the tlr domains have similar functions in all species and that the data from human and mouse tlrs regarding dimerisation and ligand binding sites can in most cases be extrapolated to other mammalian species. having said this, we are aware that functional changes can occur during evolution that could lead to taxon-specific selective pressures.

taxon-specific signatures of selection
traces of selection detected in large, diverse mammalian sequence sets alone do not necessarily reflect substitutions which are of current functional relevance for any one species. such patterns could also be the result of ancient selection events which triggered functional changes which afterwards became fixed or gradually lost their importance. therefore we analysed in addition a separate set of ruminant sequences. differences between the complete mammalian dataset and the ruminant dataset should reflect functional changes during evolution and could help to highlight those aa sites which may be of current functional importance in cattle .

during the emergence of the artiodactyla there was a strong positive selection on the tlr <dig> gene. however, in the subsequent period of ruminant evolution, the majority of potentially-positive selected class  <dig> aa sites seen in mammals seem to have returned to a nearly neutral evolution within ruminants. one reason for this is that the branches within ruminants are much shorter than in the extended species phylogenetic tree. the power of site classification has therefore limitations and has resulted in much less class  <dig> and  <dig> assignments. however, the absolute number of ω in ruminants nearly always pointed to less selective constraint in either direction. this has resulted in a lower variance of ω in ruminants than in mammals generally .

many tlr <dig> lrr motifs which contain sites known to be responsible for ligand binding in human or mouse and display high ω in the entire mammalian dataset were considerably less positively-selected in ruminants . in a remarkable contrast, most of those domains which are crucial for dimerisation and under strong purifying selection in the complete mammalian dataset are less conserved in ruminants .

therefore we speculate that this might reflect functional changes of these sites during evolution, releasing these aas from strong selective pressure in ruminants. differences between species in ligand recognition are known for several tlrs  <cit>  and can result in species-specific immune responses to certain pathogens.

exchanges along branches
the above speculation is also supported by the exchanges along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. during the emergence of the artiodactyla there was a strong positive selection on the tlr <dig> gene, whereas in the subsequent period involving the spread of ruminants the majority of initially positive selected class  <dig> sites on tlr <dig> return to a nearly neutral evolution characterized by average ω along the branches .

however, there are two exceptions to this general pattern for ruminants as a whole: the separation of small and large ruminants and the evolution of ovine tlr <dig> in ibex and sheep. the tlr <dig> of the common ancestor of bovidae  separated into two branches corresponding to small  and large  ruminants. the first branch  is based on an extraordinary concentration of aa exchanges in the tir domain on aa sites which were driven by positive selection  and occurred at positions near to aa sites which were reported to be responsible for heterodimerisation with tlr <dig> in human and mouse  <cit> . gene conversion events between tlr <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  could trigger such positive selection on aa sites which are normally under strong purifying selection, resulting in high ω for such aa sites in the otherwise highly conserved domain. similarly, most exchanges of the second branch  leading to large bovine ruminants  were under positive selection in both the general mammalian and ruminant datasets . in fact this was the only branch in which more altered sites were under positive selection in ruminants than in mammals, including four aa sites which were classified as class  <dig> in mammals, but as class  <dig> in ruminants. it is possible that these exchanges were caused by adaptive selection and resulted in bovine specific functional changes.

contrary to the generally observed phylogeny of tlr <dig> in the different species, the tlr <dig> of capra ibex and ovis aries cluster closely together but relatively distant from capra hircus. the branch separating both species from the other small ruminants  is formed by exchanges which are all concentrated in a region within the first  <dig> aa of the protein, affecting lrr domains which are thought to be responsible for ligand binding. one of the exchanges  affected a position known to be crucial for lipopeptide detection in human tlr <dig> , and two further substitutions were located near these sites  <cit> . high ω were probably the product of adaptation to specific pathogens which is known to trigger diversifying selection  <cit> . the sequences might reflect specific adaptation to certain microbial/pathogen environments. in this case, a high variation within species would be expected in line with the different environments in which these species evolve. this would predict polymorphisms in common in several closely related species and possibly appear fixed in certain environments. the capra hircus sequence originated from an indian sample, while the ovis aries and capra ibex individuals were both from europe. the different clustering might therefore reflect the geographic origin rather than the differences between species.

determination of polymorphic sites likely to have functional effects
the relative genetic disparity between bos indicus and bos taurus is well established  <cit>  and this genetic distance would explain some of the tlr <dig> polymorphisms observed between these two subspecies. however, the difference would not just be defined by random events over the time they diverged, but also by different microbial environments that the animals evolve within. the bos indicus breeds analysed herein originated in tropical or subtropical climates where the pathogen population is generally different to that encountered by the bos taurus breeds sampled which all inhabited europe. consequently, there will be different selective pressures acting on the tlr and other immune related genes in these subspecies, which would result in sites being differentially fixed in their tlr genes.

functionally-important aas in the ligand-binding domains of the tlrs would be shaped by selection. conserved aa sites are protected by purifying selection and therefore normally fixed. sporadic mutations at such sites are likely to disappear very quickly from any of the population they have occurred in. this is probably the case for the substitutions found at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . all four exchanges were polymorphic within a single breed and it can be assumed that these are random mutations, possibly with no functional effect and low frequency. neutral mutations  are expected to have no functional relevance. they might have appeared randomly and spread or disappeared driven by genetic drift rather than by selection. in our dataset, such exchanges  appeared mostly in only one breed and at low frequency. in such circumstances functional relevance is unlikely. in contrast, aa sites that are shaped by positive selection are expected to spread quickly in populations in which their occurrence has positive functional effects.

sites which are shaped by positive selection in the complete mammalian dataset, but not in the ruminant dataset might have lost their functional significance during evolution. five polymorphic sites fell into this category  and all but position  <dig> had a relatively common aa substitution , which indicates that functional effects in cattle are not very likely.

in contrast, aa sites which are positively selected in ruminants, but not in the complete dataset are candidates for ruminant-specific tlr <dig> functions . this is likely particularly if such sites are differentially fixed in breeds originating from or evolving in different geographical  environments . the substitution leu227phe was fixed for phe in all bos taurus breeds analysed whereas the wildtype leu occured only in bos indicus. this substitution had a low blosum <dig> score which suggests that the establishment of a leu-phe replacement in any given population is a scarce event and therefore is more likely to affect function. this pattern could be explained by a selective advantage of phe in a temperate environment in which the sampled bos taurus breed originated and thus this polymorphism is of interest for future functional study.

functional effects are also possible from polymorphisms at aa sites which are positively selected in both ruminants and mammals generally . these aa sites are most likely to be of functional importance if they are differentially fixed in breeds evolving in different microbial environments. for example, at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of tlr <dig> the mutations were fixed in bos indicus breeds sharing common environments .

functional consequences seem likely for his305pro with a p-value for class  <dig> assignment of  <dig> and a seldom aa exchange . this aa was subject to a frequent change during evolution . in all other ruminants only his and tyr occurred at this site. pro appears to be a new mutation which possibly occurred recently in bos indicus and was only observed in the sahiwal sample. a higher number of sahiwal individuals is needed to estimate the frequency of occurrence of this allele and whether a positive functional effect is predicted.

the his326gln exchange in tlr <dig> takes place within the ligand-binding region of tlr <dig>  <cit> , but where the human tlr <dig> positional homologue is a tyr. tyr and gln are uncharged, in contrast to his which is positively charged. during the phylogeny of tlr <dig> this position has changed several times, including back mutations  which suggest adaptive positive selection . the fixation of the wildtype in bos taurus and of the mutant in two of three bos indicus breeds indicates that possible adaptive selection might depend on the environment the animals are held in. this exchange is therefore likely to have functional consequences for the ligand binding ability of bovine tlr <dig> 

similarly, the occurrence of arg563his in different breeds could be explained by adaptive selection. however, the site appears to be unchanged in nearly all ruminants , while all non-ruminants are fixed with leu at this position, pointing to a ruminant specificity with a high level of conservation. the p-values for the class  <dig> assignments for this are not robust and raise the issue that this could be a neutrally evolving polymorphism which spreads due to genetic drift.

CONCLUSIONS
within bovine tlr <dig>  we have identified that selective constraint has acted differentially on sites associated with domains with distinct functions. amino acids responsible for tlr-pamp ligand binding have been shaped for the most part by positive selection, while sites linked to tlr heterodimerisation are conserved. this suggests that adaptive selection shapes ligand binding sites to improve the recognition of different relevant pathogens and that aa at such sites reflect microbial environments. polymorphism affecting these aas is therefore likely to result in functional consequences.

however, sites can lose or gain functional importance during evolution. this seems to be of particular importance in ruminants as reflected in a change of selective constraint on certain aas. this could have implications for the way the ruminant innate immune system works and should be further investigated using comparative functional studies.

polymorphism in bovine tlr <dig> occurs mainly between breeds and is probably associated with different geographic and therefore microbial environments. this could be investigated further by population genetic studies which would link the occurrence of certain variants with certain pathogen environments.

polymorphic sites likely to be functionally relevant in bovine tlr <dig> were predicted by analysis of: selective constraint, molecular evolution, extrapolating information about tlr domain functions from human and mouse to cattle and estimating the effect of the aa exchanges observed. such sites have been identified at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the tlr <dig> predicted polypeptide and affect aas or domains known to be involved in the recognition of pamp ligands by tlr <dig> 

a final proof of their functional relevance requires further studies to determine their effect on the immune response after stimulation with relevant ligands and/or their association with immune related traits in animals. this would facilitate the identification of particular disease susceptibility/resistance in cattle and will provide a valuable tool for the breeding industry to improve genetic resistance against a range of pathogens.
