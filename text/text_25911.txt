BACKGROUND
pepper  is a member of the solanaceae family which is becoming an increasingly important vegetable crop worldwide due to its wide diversity and high quality in flavor, concentration of vitamins and other antioxidants. in addition to its dietary and culinary importance, capsaicinoid compounds of pepper are being used in the pharmaceutical industry
 <cit> . pepper has five domesticated and 15– <dig> wild crossable species. similar to other members of the solanaceae family such as tomato, pepper has been used as a model organism for classical and molecular genetics analyses. selfing and crosses among and within certain species can be made readily and multiple generations can be easily produced each year. this creates the genetic diversity that is required for conventional breeding programs. however, the commercial application of these genomic resources for gene discovery and molecular breeding has been limited by paucity of available informative molecular markers. the limited amount of molecular markers is primarily due to lack of availability of the pepper genome sequence and sequence resources. for instance, over the past two decades, a variety of molecular markers  have been developed and applied to several intra- and inter-specific crosses of pepper
 <cit> . however, due to their nature, the majority of these markers, except cosii and tomato cdna markers, that have been used in the published genetic maps of pepper are not high throughput or gene-based.

from among many types of molecular markers that have been developed during the past three decades, simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most attractive ones for breeding
 <cit> . ssrs are co-dominant and can be assayed in any laboratory with minimum facilities or they can be automated with capillary sequencers for moderate throughput. on the other hand, snps are extremely abundant; the majority are biallelic; they are easily scored and can be tightly linked to or are the actual cause of allelic  differences in traits. moreover, there are several high-throughput technologies based on allele-specific pcr, hybridization and single base-pair extension which makes them cost-effective for assaying large numbers of genotypes once robust snps have been identified. however, without using recent bioinformatics tools and next generation sequencing , identifying snps and ssrs within a genome as large as pepper 
 <cit>  is not a trivial task.

prior to the advent of ngs technologies, discovering putative snps was achieved using low throughput electrophoresis or capillary sequencing
 <cit> . these methods are lengthy, low coverage and expensive per data point. however, we should recognize that sanger sequencing has provided a wealth of est sequences that have been the primary basis of identifying snps
 <cit> . in  <dig> at the onset of the pepper genechip® project the sequencing resources of pepper were largely limited to the est sequences that were developed by dr. doil choi at seoul national university. assembling the est sequences into unigenes and mining snps in silico is one of the approaches that has been used for marker development
 <cit> . in order to take the genotyping resources of pepper to the next level- we used affymetrix genechip arrays
 <cit>  as a new tool for massively parallel marker discovery and genotyping in pepper. this novel tool uses a new generation of markers called single position polymorphisms or spps
 <cit> . therefore, assembling ests enabled us, first to design and produce the genotyping chips and second to extract a wealth of polymorphism in pepper.

in recent years, sequencing of expressed genes  using ngs technologies such as solid, illumina and  <dig>  has been used for gene discovery and allele mining
 <cit> . this method, also known as rnaseq, has been used in many plant and animal species such as maize
 <cit> , brassica
 <cit> , arabidopsis
 <cit> , rice
 <cit> , human
 <cit> , and mouse
 <cit> . with the advent of ngs technologies, the number of publications describing de novo assemblies of plants transcripts and other organisms has been increasing constantly. in addition to availability of sequences, bioinformatics tools have also been developed to process, analyze and store the massive data that are generated daily. for instance, one of the most popular assemblers is the velvet
 <cit>  software package which is able to assemble short reads derived from illumina into contigs using de bruijn graphs
 <cit>  algorithm. however, velvet is not the only assembler for short reads. soap de novo, abyss
 <cit>  and clc genomics workbench, which is commercially available, are just a few examples of many other assemblers. in the current study we took advantage of both velvet and clc to make de novo assemblies of transcriptomes of three pepper lines, maor, early jalapeño and cm <dig> 

the final goal in many transcriptome sequencing efforts is to annotate sequences by connecting them to biological information. annotation of sequences allows one to have insight into the function and structure of the genome. without annotation, sequences have little meaning. availability of intronic regions through genome sequencing facilitates gene model predictions, which help to identify locations of regulatory elements as well as alternate splicing events. however, for pepper, a whole genome sequence is still not available and to-date all annotations have been carried out on transcriptome sequences
 <cit> . automated annotation is an approach that provides us an immediate response to a question that we pose. is there any similarity between unknown sequences and previously characterized sequences from the same or other species? normally this will be done by the basic local alignment search tool  to find the best matches between the unknown and known sequences followed by mapping the results to gene ontology  terms
 <cit>  and associating the go terms with functional proteins, using the results of previous steps. in the present study we performed an in silico annotation of both sanger-est and iga transcriptome assemblies of pepper. the current annotation information can be used for candidate gene discovery, identification of regulatory elements and gene prediction before the full annotation of a pepper genome becomes available. we have also developed a mysql database and a web interface that can be queried to find information about the assemblies, such as ssr or snp makers within each contig and to find their corresponding annotation.

RESULTS
pepper sanger-ests assembly
we developed a non-redundant set of unigenes based on all available sequences for pepper  to design a tiling affymetrix genechip array for marker discovery and application in pepper
 <cit> . merging the kribb  sequences  with the processed genbank sequences  resulted in  <dig>  sequences. after trimming, a total of  <dig>  sequences remained, including  <dig>  est sequences,  <dig> assembled mrnas,  <dig> genomic sequences and  <dig> cosii marker sequences . c. annuum made up  <dig> % of the sequences with minor representation from, c. frutescens, c. chinense and c. baccatum. hereafter, the assembly of sanger ests is called the sanger-est assembly. in the sanger-est assembly,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained with  <dig>  consensus sequences and  <dig>  singletons. the number of unigenes account for  <dig> % of initial input sequences . unigenes with a size less than  <dig> nucleotides  accounted for  <dig> % of the total unigenes. the summary statistics of the sanger-est assembly are presented in figure 
1a and table 
 <dig>  the final assembly, consisting of  <dig>  unigenes greater than  <dig> nt, was annotated and mined for ssrs and snps.

de novo pepper illumina transcriptome assembly
the illumina transcriptome sequencing generated ~ <dig> m,  <dig> m and  <dig> m cleaned and trimmed reads in cm <dig>  maor and early jalapeño, respectively. the raw data were submitted to ncbi sequence read archive  under accession no. sra <dig>  and the trimmed reads submitted to european nucleotide archive  under study number erp <dig>  the more stringently trimmed reads ranged between  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length as described in methods. to compare assembly performance of different k-mer  values
 <cit> , we tested k values of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp. applying different k-mers resulted in the use of different numbers of reads but the overall trend was toward the use of more reads in the assembly as the k-mer increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  in velvet, 64% - 79% of the sequences were used in each assembly as the k-mer value was increased. both velvet and clc produced significantly fewer contigs, with average reductions ranging from 48% in velvet to 35% in clc, when using stringently trimmed data. for instance, in the case of early jalapeño by using untrimmed and trimmed data at k =  <dig> bp, the number of contigs generated in the two assemblies was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the fraction of contigs longer than  <dig> kb varied from 83%  to 72%  for untrimmed and trimmed data . median weighted  lengths of assemblies were highest at k =  <dig> bp for both untrimmed and trimmed data . the meta assembly which is called hereafter the pepper iga  transcriptome assembly, comprises assembly of contigs from velvet and clc and had the largest median of all assemblies  with  <dig>  contigs and an assembly of >135m bases . the final results and steps to generate de novo assembly of pepper iga reads are presented in table 
 <dig> 

* the untrimmed reads were between 40– <dig> nt long. the same reads were trimmed by  <dig> and  <dig> nt from 5' an 3' ends respectively to eliminate the possible sequencing errors at the beginning and at the end of each read. the numbers were selected arbitrarily but k= <dig> is the velvet recommended value.

a no of contigs longer than  <dig> nucleotides were included in all assemblies.

b six velvet iterations including three k-mers of normally trimmed data and  <dig> k-mers of stringently trimmed data were assembled using cap <dig> program.

c two clc iterations including one normally trimmed data and one stringently trimmed data were assembled using cap <dig> program.

annotation of sanger-est assembly
both assemblies were annotated using blast2go software
 <cit> . blast2go annotation is gene ontology  based data mining for sequences with unknown function
 <cit> . the results of each step of blast2go annotation of the sanger-est assembly are summarized in figure 
2a. blastx of the sanger-est assembly unigenes against the genbank non-redundant protein database resulted in the identification of  <dig>   sequences with at least one significant alignment to an existing gene model and with an average contig length of  <dig> nt. these contigs covered  <dig> m bases  of the total sanger-est assembly. the  <dig>  unigenes that did not have any hit in the genbank were on average  <dig> nt long and were covering  <dig> m  bases. the mapping step of blast2go resulted in association of  <dig>   unigenes with go terms
 <cit>  . the unigenes were assigned between  <dig> and  <dig> go terms with a weighted average of five go terms per unigenes. the annotation step of blast2go assigned functions to  <dig>   of unigenes. a query with interproscan increased the number of annotated unigenes by 17%. the results of the blast2go annotation were merged with the results of the interpro annotation to maximize the number of annotated sequences. by categorizing all blastx results, vitis vinifera, glycine max, arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa and oryza sativa were among the top five plant species in terms of the total number of hits to the sanger-est unigenes . however, when the results were categorized based on the highest similarity between each of the sanger-est unigenes and sequences in the databases, the top five plant species were v. vinifera, p. trichocarpa, ricinus communis, g. max and solanum lycopersicum . direct go count graphs were created to categorize the sequences to several groups based on their biological processes, molecular functions and cellular component ontologies. inside the biological processes category, sequences in cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus, biological regulation and localization had the highest frequencies. in terms of molecular function, transferase activity, nucleotide binding and ion binding related sequences were the top three go terms in the sanger-est assembly. among cellular components, the go terms corresponding to constituents of the cytosol , intracellular part , plasma membrane and organelle had the highest numbers in the assembly [see additional file
1: figure s11a-c]. the results of annotation can be accessed and queried through the pepper genechip database  or [see additional file
2: table s1].

annotation of iga transcriptome assembly
the three steps of blast2go annotation of the iga transcriptome assembly are summarized in figure 
2b. a total of  <dig>  contigs  with an average length of  <dig>  nucleotides had at least one significant alignment with a protein in the non-redundant database of genbank. these contigs covered  <dig> m bases,  of the total assembly. however, the  <dig>   contigs that did not have hit to any sequence in genbank were on average  <dig> nucleotide long and covered  <dig>  m bases,  of the total assembly. the mapping step of blast2go identified  <dig>   contigs with go terms. a significant amount of mapping data  were derived from uniprotkb database followed by tair and gr_protein. in addition,  <dig> other databases were searched but did not significantly contribute to the mapping process. between 1– <dig> go terms were assigned per sequence with a weighted average of  <dig> go terms per contig . twelve percent,  of contigs, were annotated as functional proteins. the frequency of go terms for shorter sequences  was less than that of longer sequences. the percentage of annotated sequences increased proportionally with their length, such that sequences longer than  <dig>  kb were 100% annotated. as expected, the majority of annotations were inferred electronically compared to direct assays  [see additional file
1: figure s5–s6]. by counting all significant hits in the blastx result table, v. vinifera, a. thaliana and o. sativa were the top three species in terms of hit number . as figure 
4c depicts, based on this grouping solanum sp. did not have as many hits as other less closely related species to pepper. however, when we filtered the blastx results based on similarity of pepper contigs with solanum species, solanum sp. were ranked after v. vinifera, p. trichocarpa and r. communis . interproscan, annex, and go annotation query through more than  <dig> databases significantly increased annotation by 15%. direct go count graphs were created to categorize the sequences based on their biological processes and molecular functions as well as their cellular component. based on their biological processes sequences involved in cellular process, metabolic process and response to stimulus had the maximum frequencies. in terms of molecular function, nucleic acid binding elements comprised the highest numbers of sequences in the iga transcriptome assembly, followed by transferase activity and nucleotide binding related sequences. cellular component constituents of intracellular organelle, cytoplasm and cytoplasmic part and plasma membrane were among sequences that had the maximum numbers in the assembly [see additional file
1: figure s12a-c]. the kegg maps for more than  <dig> metabolic pathways were generated for both assemblies and the results were exported. two examples of kegg maps for the pyrimidine metabolism pathway are depicted in figure 
4a-b. the kegg map files, the blast2go project files , interproscan and blastx files are available to download at the pepper genechip website. the results of annotation also can be accessed through the pepper genechip database or [see additional file
2: table s2].

ssr discovery in the sanger-est and the iga transcriptome assemblies
from the  <dig>  unigenes  in the sanger-est assembly,  <dig>   unigenes contain putative ssrs, from which  <dig> unigenes bear more than one ssr marker signature. a total of  <dig>  ssrs with simple repeats and  <dig>  ssrs with compound formation were identified. from  <dig>  contigs that were examined in the iga transcriptome assembly,  <dig>  contigs were identified with  <dig>  ssrs of which  <dig>  ssrs were of compound formation. from  <dig>  ssr-containing contigs,  <dig>   had more than one ssr sequence. using primer <dig> software we were able to design primers for  <dig>  and  <dig>  putative ssr markers in the sanger-est and the iga assemblies, respectively. a total of  <dig> ssrs were identified with identical motif and size between the two assemblies, resulting in  <dig>  unique ssrs. in both assemblies, di-nucleotide ag/ct was the most frequent ssr motif followed by ac/gt or at/ta. the tri-nucleotide motif aac/gtt was more frequent in the iga transcriptome assembly than that of the sanger-est assembly, while aag/ctt was more frequent in the sanger-est assembly than the iga transcriptome assembly. overall, tri-nucleotide motifs were more frequent in our iga transcriptome assembly than the sanger-est assembly. longer motifs such as tetra and penta-nucleotide motifs were less frequent than di- and tri- nucleotide motifs [see additional file
3: tables s <dig> and s6]. additional file
3: tables s <dig> and s <dig> provide lists of ssrs in the sanger-est and the iga assemblies, respectively. where possible the primers were designed for ssrs in both assemblies [see additional file
3: tables s <dig> and s8] and common ssrs are listed in additional file
3: table s <dig> 

snp discovery in sanger-est assembly
a majority of ests that were used in the sanger-est assembly were obtained from cdna libraries of a korean f <dig> hybrid . accordingly, most of the snps that we identified would belong to polymorphism between the parents of this particular f <dig> individual. in the sanger-est assembly we had  <dig>  unigenes that resulted from greater than one est. the remaining unigenes were single sequences that could not be examined for presence of snps. analysis of  <dig>  unigenes resulted in identification of  <dig>  putative snps from  <dig>  contigs [see additional file
3: table s10], an average of  <dig>  snps per contig. the  <dig>  contigs comprise  <dig>  kb of pepper sanger-est assembly. therefore, on average  <dig> snp per  <dig>  bases of pepper sanger-est assembly was identified.

snp discovery in the iga transcriptome assembly
the iga transcriptome assembly comprised  <dig>  unigenes including  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons . in order to make a fair comparison between the iga transcriptome assembly and the sanger-est assembly, we employed only  <dig>  contigs of the iga transcriptome assembly to discover snps. using only contigs in the assembly a total of  <dig>  putative snps were identified, that is ~ <dig> snp per contig. snps were filtered for the presence of an adjacent snp in the vicinity of  <dig> bases. after filtering, a total of  <dig>  snps were remaining that were used in calculation of snp density. the  <dig>  contigs that were mined for snps represented  <dig>  kb of the pepper iga transcriptomes that contains on average  <dig> snp per  <dig>  bases identified in the pepper iga transcriptome assembly.

in order to provide a set of more reliable set of putative snps to the public; in a separate analysis all  <dig>  sequences of iga transcriptome assembly were used, thereby a total of  <dig>  putative snps were identified. these putative snps were first filtered for the presence of flanking intronic region junction, adjacent putative snps as well as heterozygote positions in their  <dig> bp vicinity . after applying all of the filters across the three genotypes used for the iga transcriptome assembly, a total of  <dig>  putative snps were retained [see additional file
3: table s11]. the snps were submitted to database of single nucleotide polymorphisms . bethesda : national center for biotechnology information, national library of medicine. dbsnp accession:, , available from ncbi snp database website.

comparison of snps between the sanger-est and the iga transcriptome assemblies
to identify the unique and common snps between the two assemblies, the following alignments were made reciprocally for each snp using blastn. a  <dig> nt fragment from the sanger-est assembly with a snp at the center was aligned with all snp-containing fragments  of the iga transcriptome assembly and vice versa. a valid hit counted as the one with a minimum of  <dig> nt matches in the alignment. the reciprocal comparison of snps from each assembly determined that  <dig>  out of  <dig>  snps were unique to the sanger-est assembly [see additional file
3: table s12]. of the  <dig>  snps from the iga transcriptome assembly  <dig>   snps were unique to that assembly [see additional file
3: table s13]. finally, a total of  <dig> common snps between the two assemblies were identified by this analysis [see additional file
3: table s14] resulting in  <dig>  unique snps.

snp validation
out of  <dig> snps assayed, three  did not produce any pcr product and  <dig>  had ambiguous calls, that is one allele was called correctly according to our snp discovery pipeline but the alternate allele could not be unequivocally determined by kaspar assay. out of  <dig> remaining snp assays ,  <dig>  were polymorphic  and  <dig> were monomorphic across the genotyping panel . from  <dig> polymorphic assays,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were snps and spp, respectively. therefore,  <dig> out of  <dig>  amplifiable snp assays were polymorphic across the diversity panel described in hill et al.
 <cit>  [see additional file
3: table s15]. we also investigated the polymorphism rate of  <dig> putative snps among the three pepper genotypes that were used for transcriptome assembly . a total of  <dig> out of  <dig>  assays were polymorphic in the diversity panel. however,  <dig> out of  <dig> snps identified in the iga transcriptome assembly were called correctly based on kaspar assay. although the remaining  <dig> putative snps showed polymorphism between lines, they had low coverage  and did not meet our filtering criteria , therefore were not included in our final snp dataset from the iga transcriptome assembly.

discussion
we report on two transcriptome assemblies of pepper, the first is based on sanger-est sequences was used in the pepper genechip® project
 <cit> . the second is based on a collection of transcriptomes of three pepper lines that were sequenced by iga technology. the majority of pepper est sequences that were used in the current project had been first assembled by kim et al. , in which they had assembled  <dig>  unigenes with an average consensus sequences length of  <dig>  bp. however, in order to construct the pepper genechip microarray prior to the kim publication, we added all pepper sequences and resources that were available at the time  of the assembly. in addition to c. annuum est sequences from korean f <dig> hybrid of bukang, we added > <dig> sequences from other c. annuum cultivars and other pepper species such as c. baccatum, c. frutescens and c. chinense. we added pepper genomic and mrna sequences from genbank and cos marker sequences from solanaceae genome network  and uc davis
 <cit> . we used a combination of several in-house scripts and cap <dig> to make our assembly, while kim et al. took a different approach to make the assembly. regardless of the methods used to assemble est sequences, the database that kim et al. has created is useful per se to query for the sequence information and find annotation of each contig. we have enhanced the information for sanger pepper ests by mining and validating a subset of snps from this assembly. we have also leveraged the information to develop an affymetrix tiling array to construct two ultra-saturated genetic maps of pepper
 <cit>  and to evaluate genetic diversity in pepper breeding germplasm
 <cit> . overall, we were able to map > <dig>  unigenes representing over  <dig>  genetic bins of pepper
 <cit> . in the second pepper assembly we attempted to capture as many transcribed genes as possible by collecting tissues from three different genotypes  in different developmental stages. recently a transcriptome assembly of two pepper parental lines  and their hybrid line  was carried out by lu et al.
 <cit> . lu et al. used the gs- <dig> flx titanium  to sequence mrna that was collected from fruits of greenhouse-grown peppers. the pepper land race, cm <dig>  in the lu et al. study was the same land race that we used, but they sequenced it by roche  <dig> system and sampled fewer tissues. furthermore, we normalized our libraries prior to sequencing. using gs de novo assembling software  they were able to assemble  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   contigs in each of cm <dig>  taean and tf <dig>  respectively. functional annotation of these contigs was performed by funcat
 <cit> , by which it was determined that the majority of contigs were involved in proteins with binding function, regulation and metabolism. these results are similar to our functional annotation. the capsicum transcriptome database, a most recent study of pepper transcriptomes, was recently introduced by góngora-castillo et al.
 <cit> . using sanger and gs-pyrosequencing technologies they sequenced thirty-three cdna libraries of c. annuum var. sonora anaheim and c. annuum var. serrano tampiqueño. finally, creating a hybrid assembly of sanger-est sequences and gs-pyrosequencing using the  <dig> newbler program was made using over  <dig>  m  <dig> reads and sanger-est sequences. this assembly consists of  <dig>  contigs with n <dig> of  <dig> and contig length ranging from 100– <dig>  nt. the number of contigs of their assembly was close to our sanger-est assembly, as well as the three pepper assemblies reported by lu et al.
 <cit> . however, the number of contigs might be slightly over estimated because they took into account contigs with a minimum of  <dig> nt in length, whereas in our sanger-est assembly the smallest contig was  <dig> nt.

while the  <dig> system generates long sequences, it suffers from low sequence depth, which is the unique advantage of the iga system. roche  <dig> performs poorly over the homopolymer regions of the genome. while iga performs better on those regions, it has the disadvantage of generating short reads. therefore a hybrid assembly of long and short reads to resolve the shortfalls of both sequencing systems would improve the quality of assembly. in spite of using iga technology alone by sequencing three lines of pepper and boosting the number and length of reads  per iga lane, we were able to assemble > <dig> m nucleotides in our assembly, which is  <dig> times more than any previously reported assemblies. in addition to the number of bases assembled, the n <dig> of the transcriptome assembly of this study is twice that of assemblies that were made with pyrosequencing alone.

in the present study we also annotated the two assemblies of pepper transcriptomes. according to the percentage of annotated contigs, 65% of the sanger-est assembly contigs and 35% of the iga transcriptome assembly contigs were annotated. there are a number of reasons for the lower percentage of annotation of the iga transcriptome assembly; one is that there were more novel sequences in the iga transcriptome assembly compared to the sanger-est assembly. these new sequences did not have any hit in the genbank, and as a result the number of sequences that were not annotated increased. contig length also contributes to lower annotation. since there were relatively more short contigs in the iga transcriptome assembly than the sanger-est assembly, the percent of annotated sequences was lower. also, during the sanger sequencing procedure there is a cloning step involved in library construction, which favors selection for higher copy number transcripts, resulting in redundancy in annotated sequences and a lower number of unannotated sequences as well as poor sampling of single-copy sequences. based on the number of annotated contigs our results for iga analysis are similar to lu et al.
 <cit> . considering the number of assembled nucleotides in contrast to the number of contigs, the present two assemblies were quite comparable, 70% in the iga transcriptome assembly vs. 82% in the sanger-est assembly. in the sanger-est assembly 23% of the contigs or  <dig> % of nucleotides did not align to any homologous sequences in the genbank, therefore these sequences can be identified as potential novel transcripts or genes in pepper that were not previously characterized or simply were too short for conclusive annotation. not surprising, the annotations of both assemblies presented here are very similar in terms of species distribution of top-hits. this is probably due to the bias in databases toward having more data for certain species that have been annotated better than the others. at the time of analysis tomato genome annotation was not available in genbank databases which could be the reason as to why s. lycopersicum is not on the top of species hit list.

another aspect of our study was to assign transcripts to different metabolic pathways. generating kegg maps and designating enzymes to different metabolic pathways is an effective way to identify candidate genes. in an ultra-saturated genetic map of pepper, contigs that are spanning a qtl can be further examined for their role in one or more metabolic pathways. finding annotated contigs will then help to identify kegg maps related to the enzymes and metabolites involved in the traits and further investigate their function in controlling traits.

one of our goals in this project was to develop markers that can readily be used in breeding programs. we presented here two sets of markers, ssr and snp for genetic and breeding analyses in pepper. the putative snps that were discovered in the sanger-est assembly were internally validated by kaspar assays in a genotyping panel of  <dig> pepper lines and accessions. it is deemed to be very robust and reliable despite the lower sequence depth compared to snps that were discovered in the iga transcriptome assembly. we also observed a comparable snp frequency in both assemblies  indicating snp frequency in pepper transcriptomes is plausibly consistent across methods and accessions used in different experiments. coincidently, the polymorphism among three diverse lines, cm <dig>  early jalapeño and maor
 <cit> , and those within the f1-hybrid of bukang was similar.

CONCLUSIONS
there was a great need to generate an abundant number of molecular markers for breeding programs of pepper. to that end, assembling transcriptomes seemed very promising in the identification of thousands of high-quality markers before a pepper genome sequence becomes available. as a result of our efforts, the generated markers are currently being used in genetic mapping and qtl analyses by different groups around the globe. in order to have a better understanding of the assembled sequences and to identify candidate genes underlying qtls, we also annotated the contigs of sanger-est and rnaseq assemblies. these and other information have been curated in a database that we have dedicated for pepper genechip project . nevertheless, the main task still will remain to sequence the pepper genome and to use the available genetic resources to develop new pepper varieties with higher yields, better flavors and more resistance to biotic as well as abiotic stresses.
