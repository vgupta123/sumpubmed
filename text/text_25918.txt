BACKGROUND
many human cancers display abnormal post-translational modifications of histones, including acetylation , and histone deacetylases  are known to be aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancer cells  <cit> . it has been suggested that changes in histone modifications and histone deacetylase expression levels may be useful prognostic indicators of survival and recurrence in a variety of cancers . mammalian hdacs can be subdivided into two families: the classical hdac family and the sirtuins. the classical hdacs are zn2+ dependent enzymes: class i hdacs  share homology to the yeast hdac rpd <dig> and are localized to the nucleus; class ii hdacs are related to yeast hda <dig> and shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus  or reside in the cytosol . hdac  <dig> , homologous to hos <dig>  resides in the cytosol and nucleus. over the last 10– <dig> years a variety of natural and synthetic hdac inhibitors have been developed, including hydroxamic acid derivatives, benzamides, short chain fatty acids, cyclic tetrapeptides, and electrophilic ketones. hydroxamic acid derivatives, including trichostatin a , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid  and cg- <dig> , inhibit the classical family of hdacs by coordinating the catalytic site zn2+, stabilizing the acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. this induces a variety of responses including cell cycle arrest, cell death, differentiation and senescence, depending on the cell lines and inhibitors used  <cit> . hdacis are attractive agents because therapeutically active concentrations are minimally toxic to the host and transformed cells are more sensitive to hdaci-induced cell death than normal cells . to date, two hdacis, saha and romidepsin, a cyclic tetrapeptide, have been approved by the fda for the treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma  <cit> . previous studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that hydroxamic acid-based hdacis have profound impacts on the biology of prostate and breast cancer cell lines, inducing growth arrest and apoptosis .

the aim of the research reported here was to identify transcription factors that may be useful for novel therapeutic approaches in combination with hdac inhibitors for hard-to-treat-cancers. we have taken a systems biology approach, screening a saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid single gene deletion library, to identify gene products that modulate the response to hdac inhibition. s. cerevisiae is a valuable model organism for which there is a wide array of information available  to use in analyzing new high throughput data sets . furthermore, histones and histone modifying enzymes show a high degree of sequence and functional conservation among eukaryotes .

RESULTS
cg-1521-sensitive and-resistant strains are enriched for genes involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription
genomic phenotyping was performed to detect cg-1521-sensitive and –resistant strains. gene deletion strains were spotted on agar plates containing low , medium  or high  concentrations of cg- <dig>  strain growth was imaged and sensitive and resistant strains were visually identified. examples of strains with different grades of sensitivity and resistance are shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> sensitive and  <dig> resistant gene deletion mutants were identified . s. cerevisiae is more resistant to the hydroxamic acid based hdaci tsa and saha. sensitive strains can only be identified with concentrations starting at 150 μm tsa, while saha does not induce changes in growth up to concentrations of  <dig>  mm saha . due to these limitations, it is not feasible to identify sensitive and resistant strains in response to tsa and saha.figure  <dig>

gene ontology  analysis using david was used to determine which functional classes are enriched in proteins corresponding to the list of sensitive and resistant gene deletion strains  <cit> . gene deletion mutants that are sensitive to cg- <dig> are highly enriched in processes regulating chromatin organization and transcription . proteins corresponding to the gene deletion strains resistant to cg- <dig> are enriched for those involved in trna modification  and regulation of transcription, dna-dependent  and its child, negative regulation of transcription . the other child, positive regulation of transcription , was not significantly enriched . deletion of complexes associated with chromatin conformation, the hat and hdac complexes that modulate histone acetylation, the compass complex, which modulates histone methylation and the swi/snf, swr <dig> and ino <dig> complexes that are central to changes in chromatin conformation, all confer sensitivity to cg- <dig> . proteins of several other biological processes associated with transcriptional regulation, modulate the response to cg- <dig>  including elongation factors  and ctd kinases, as well as other modulators of transcription. additionally, cellular machineries of translation and mrna processing, including poly-modification, mrna degradation and splicing affect the sensitivity to cg- <dig>  gene products of several other biological processes, including vacuolar acidification, vacuolar protein sorting, vesicle-mediated transport, dna repair and cell cycle regulation  predominantly decrease the sensitivity to cg- <dig>  deletion mutants, lacking genes important for bud site selection, recovery from arrest in response to pheromone, g1/s and g2/m progression and cytokinesis are sensitive to cg- <dig>  components of the mediator and elongator complexes are enriched in the resistant strains. since the elongator complex has roles in transcription elongation and wobble nucleoside modification in trna, it is not clear whether one or both processes are important in the response to cg- <dig> .table  <dig>

functional categorization of cg-1521-sensitive and-resistant strains. strains displaying a phenotype were categorized according to their function and incorporation in protein complexes. gene deletions confer sensitivity  or resistance  to cg- <dig> 



to confirm the sensitivity of the strains a secondary screen was performed in liquid culture as detailed in methods . sixty five of seventy two tested sensitive strains were validated. these encompass gene deletion mutants that lack genes involved in transcription  and chromatin remodeling, including components of the rpd3l , swr <dig>  and the gcn <dig> hat complex .

loss of gcn <dig> hat complexes confers sensitivity to cg-1521
deletion mutants associated with gcn <dig> hat complexes are overrepresented  in the cg-1521-sensitive strains  complex) . gcn <dig> is a component of three hat complexes in s. cerevisiae, the ada, saga and slik  complexes. of the sixteen components that have corresponding deletion strains in the library, ten are sensitive  and six are not sensitive . deletion of spt <dig>  spt <dig>  gcn <dig> and ada <dig> results in high sensitivity to cg- <dig> . gene deletion mutants sgf29Δ, spt3Δ, spt8Δ and hfi1Δ are moderately sensitive  and ngg1Δ and sgf73Δ display low sensitivity . sensitivity scores from the screen and the human homologs of the gcn <dig> hat complex components can be found in additional file  <dig>  the ada, saga and slik complexes share the hat core module, consisting of the catalytically active histone acetyltransferase gcn <dig>  ada <dig>  ada3/ngg <dig> and sgf <dig>  deletion of any of these genes confers sensitivity to cg- <dig> treatment. in contrast, deletion of ada or slik specific components does not result in sensitivity to cg- <dig>  suggesting that the saga complex is required to reduce inhibitory effects of cg- <dig> on cell growth. deletion of the deubiquitination  module components, ubp <dig> and sgf <dig>  does not sensitize cells to cg- <dig>  indicating that other functions of the saga complex are critical for the response to cg- <dig> figure  <dig> 
sensitivity of components of the gcn <dig> hat complexes. the assembly and spatial organization of saga, slik and ada complexes are shown, adapted from  <cit> . the organization of the slik complex was inferred from that of the saga complex. the saga complex consists of four modules, the hat core module, the dub module, the spt module and the taf module. the slik complex contains an additional protein rtg <dig>  a truncated spt <dig> and is missing spt <dig>  the hat module and the ada module make up the ada complex. components not depicted are chd <dig> and rtg <dig> 



the sensitivity of strains lacking components of these hat complexes has been validated on agar plates using several starting cell densities as well as three different concentrations of cg- <dig> . the most sensitive strains are hfi1Δ and spt20Δ, displaying sensitivity at 25 μm cg- <dig>  most deletion mutants demonstrate the same sensitivity to cg- <dig> as in the initial screen, however, the sensitivity of the hfi1Δ mutant is enhanced compared to the screen and yeast deletion mutants ngg1Δ and spt3Δ show slightly increased sensitivity.figure  <dig>

to confirm that the sensitivity of the gcn5Δ strain is due to the loss of gcn <dig>  the sensitivity of the gcn <dig> complemented strain  was compared to the by <dig> wild-type and the gcn5Δ strain. complementation with gcn <dig> results in a similar level of resistance as the wild-type , highlighting an important role for gcn <dig> in modulating the biological response to cg- <dig>  to assess the importance of the acetyltransferase function of gcn <dig> in the attenuation of cg- <dig> activity, the sensitivity of the catalytic site mutant gcn <dig> e173q, which has minimal residual catalytic activity  <cit> , was measured in liquid culture. as shown in table  <dig>  compared to the wild-type, the gcn5Δ mutant is sensitive at  <dig> and 50 μm cg- <dig>  the e173q catalytic site mutant is sensitive to cg- <dig>  but to a lesser extent than the gcn5Δ mutant , suggesting that functions other than the acetyltransferase activity of gcn <dig> play a role in the response to cg- <dig> and may be sufficient to maintain cell growth.figure  <dig>

cg- <dig> treatment results in g0/g1delay and deletion of gcn5increases susceptibility to cell death
based on the reported involvement of gcn <dig> in cell cycle  <cit> , the effects of cg- <dig> on cell cycle progression in wild-type and gcn5Δ cells were compared. the growth inhibitory effect of cg- <dig> is more pronounced in the gcn5Δ strain than in the wild-type strain as determined on agar plates and in liquid culture. cell cycle analysis shows that cg- <dig> induces g0/g <dig> arrest in both strains . treatment with 50 μm cg- <dig> leads to a significant increase in the g0/g <dig> population after 1 h and 2 h for the wild-type and the gcn5Δ strain respectively, indicating that the growth arrest is delayed in the gcn5Δ strain compared to the wild-type strain. at 4 h, the g0/g <dig> population increases by  <dig>  fold after treatment with cg- <dig> in both the wild-type and the gcn5Δ strain. the induction of g0/g <dig> delay by cg- <dig> was confirmed by budding index analysis . treatment with 50 μm cg- <dig> reduces the budding index by approximately 50% in both wild-type and gcn5Δ strains by 2 h to 4 h. as a positive control for g <dig> arrest, both strains were treated with 5 μg/ml α-factor, which reduces the budding index to approximately  <dig>  after 2 h in both strains.figure  <dig>

discussion
the global decrease in histone modification, particularly methylation and acetylation correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in a number of cancers including prostate, lung and kidney cancer  <cit> . the ability of hdacis to induce death in a variety of cell lines is well documented, however the mechanisms by which they exert their effects are incompletely understood . since many biological processes are regulated by acetylation  <cit> , we have used a yeast deletion library screen to gain insights into the cell growth inhibition mechanisms of hdac inhibitors and to identify novel targets for combination treatments with the hdaci cg- <dig>  choosing s. cerevisiae as a model organism decreases the complexity, however the high degree of functional homology among eukaryotes enables the identification of pathways that are important in the response to cg- <dig>  for example, mitotic analysis after exposure to tsa shows disruption of centromeric heterochromatin, mitotic delay and chromosome segregation defects in both fission yeast  <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit> . eukaryotic cells have varied responses to hdacis, which in mammalian cells is partially dictated by the p <dig> status of the cell lines. for example, treatment of lncap prostate cancer cells, which express wild-type p <dig>  with cg- <dig> induces g2/m arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . in contrast, tsa induces g1/s arrest  <cit> . these differences in biological response have been attributed to differences in the site specific acetylation of p <dig>  stabilized by these two drugs  <cit> . however, mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells, which express wild-type p <dig> and sum190pt, which express mutant p <dig> both arrest in g0/g <dig> after treatment with either cg- <dig> or tsa, suggesting that the complement of hdacs present in the cells also plays a significant role in dictating the biological outcome of treatment.

despite the roles of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases in dna replication and dna repair, cytoskeleton dynamics and cell cycle, these functional classes are not significantly enriched in our screen  <cit> . however cg-1521-sensitive strains are significantly enriched in vesicle-mediated transport, endocytosis and ubiquitin ligation , which have been shown to be regulated by acetylation  <cit> .

previous studies have identified  <dig> gene deletion mutants that result in reduced h3k <dig> acetylation levels in s. cerevisiae
 <cit> . these include genes associated with vacuolar-protein sorting, v-atpase and saga complexes. twenty-four of these  <dig> strains were identified as sensitive to cg- <dig> in the present study. deletion of additional genes associated with vacuolar acidification, the vacuolar proton-transporting v-type atpase complex and vacuolar transport also renders yeast cells sensitive to cg- <dig>  potentially, these cg-1521-sensitive strains are characterized by decreased histone acetylation and gcn <dig> hat activity as well. this suggests that disrupting the dynamics of acetylation and deacetylation renders cells sensitive to cg- <dig> 

strains lacking components of the gcn <dig> hat complexes are very sensitive to cg- <dig>  deletion of any of the four components of the histone acetyltransferase module  renders s. cerevisiae sensitive to cg- <dig> and deletion of components of the spt module  also results in increased sensitivity to cg- <dig>  as the taf module components  and tra <dig> are essential for cell survival, it is not possible to determine whether deletion of these proteins also confers sensitivity to cg- <dig> 

the absence of several deletion strains from the list of sensitive strains is also notable. loss of the ubp <dig> and sgf <dig> components of the deubiquitination module does not sensitize the cells to cg- <dig>  ubp <dig> and sgf <dig> are part of a discrete functional module within the saga complex as suggested by genetic interaction and microarray analysis  <cit>  and ubp <dig> is dispensable at promoters of several saga-dependent genes  <cit> . these results suggest that the effects of cg- <dig> are not modulated by the deuibiquitination activities associated with the saga complex. cg- <dig> exhibits an increased growth inhibitory effect on the sgf73Δ strain compared to the wild-type. sgf <dig> tethers the dub module to the saga complex  <cit>  and recruits the complex to its substrate to stimulate the formation of the pre-initiation complex  <cit> . it is probable that the sensitivity of the sgf73Δ strain to cg- <dig> is due to its latter role in the formation of the pre-initiation complex.

deletion of the slik specific component rtg <dig>  which, in association with rtg <dig>  rtg <dig>  mks <dig>  lst <dig> and tor <dig> is also responsible for mediating signaling between the mitochondrion and nucleus  does not alter the response to cg- <dig>  since rtg <dig> is required for slik integrity  <cit> , this suggests that the slik complex is not necessary for eliciting a response to cg- <dig>  in addition, deletion of ada  specific components does not sensitize cells to cg- <dig>  indicating that it is the saga complex, rather than ada or slik complexes, that reduces the growth-inhibitory effects of cg- <dig> 

the saga complex may also act as physical adapter independent of gcn <dig> and recruit tbp through spt <dig> and spt <dig>  for example, it has been shown that h <dig> acetylation and hat activity at the gal <dig> promoter are not necessary for the formation of the pre-initiation complex, however pre-initiation complex assembly on the pho <dig> promoter requires gcn <dig> activity  <cit> . gene expression analysis also demonstrates that expression of distinct sets of genes is dependent on individual saga subunits  <cit> . thus it appears that the requirement for gcn <dig> activity is gene specific, suggesting that genes that require gcn <dig> for their transcription are required to ameliorate the effect of cg- <dig> 

the data suggest that other functions of gcn <dig>  besides the catalytic activity, influence the response to cg- <dig> since catalytic site mutation does not confer the same extent of sensitivity as gcn <dig> deletion. the bromodomain of gcn <dig> may recruit the hat complex to acetylated histones. studies in mice also indicate that there is a difference between gene deletion and catalytic site mutation. deletion of the murine gcn <dig> homolog is embryonic lethal, as the mice show increased apoptosis in mesodermal lineages. however, mouse embryos expressing a catalytically inactive protein survive significantly longer and die as a result of exencephaly  <cit> . these and results presented here indicate that gcn <dig> has important functions that are independent of its hat activity.

the mechanism by which cg- <dig> elicits its growth-inhibitory action is probably multifactorial. as an hdac inhibitor it differentially regulates gene expression and influences activity, stability, and assembly of protein complexes through protein acetylation. similarly, it is likely that the saga complex components, including gcn <dig>  regulate multiple pathways in response to cg- <dig>  which protect the cell. potential targets of cg- <dig> that may account for the sensitivity of the gcn5Δ strain were analyzed through identification of negative genetic interactions with gcn <dig> deletion that display insensitivity to cg- <dig>  gene ontology analysis of deletion strains that are insensitive to cg- <dig> and are synthetic lethal with gcn <dig> deletion shows an enrichment in processes like chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, histone acetylation, dna repair and response to stress. notably, deletion of components of the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase complexes  results in negative genetic interactions with gcn <dig> deletion, suggesting that the inhibition of rpd <dig> by cg- <dig> may contribute to the sensitivity of the gcn5Δ strain to cg- <dig>  the cg-1521-sensitive saga deletion mutants ada2Δ, ngg1Δ, spt3Δ, spt7Δ, spt8Δ, spt20Δ and hfi1Δ show a severe fitness defect or lethality when combined with rpd <dig> deletion . however deletion mutants of components of the rpd3l complex  are minimally or moderately sensitive to cg- <dig>  indicating that cg- <dig> inhibits several hdacs. this correlates with the fact that none of the individual yeast hdac deletion strains display resistance to cg- <dig> 

the human homologs of gcn <dig>  gcn <dig> and its paralogue pcaf , the histone acetyltransferase components of the human atac and saga complexes  <cit> , have been implicated in cancer, and these hats are co-regulators for several proto-oncogenes  <cit> . the human homolog of tra <dig>  trrap, has been shown to bind c-myc, leading to histone h <dig> acetylation and increased expression of myc-dependent genes . trrap interacts with the n-terminus of c-myc  <cit> , and truncated myc isoforms lacking part of the n-terminal transactivation domain are transcriptionally inactive  <cit> . transcriptional activation by myc requires the gcn <dig> hat activity as well as the spt3/gcn <dig> interaction domain of trrap, suggesting that trrap serves as an adapter to recruit gcn <dig> to myc-dependent genes  <cit>  and myc has been reported to globally promote an active chromatin state, potentially by upregulating gcn <dig> expression  <cit> . gcn5/pcaf also directly acetylate myc resulting in increased protein stability  <cit> , which may provide a positive feedback loop through gcn <dig> upregulation and further myc stabilization. both trrap and gcn <dig> are required for myc-dependent transformation  <cit>  and upregulation of gcn <dig> by myc contributes to the block of erythroid differentiation  <cit> . these results suggest that, gcn <dig> and myc co-operate to block differentiation and promote transformation. given the importance of gcn <dig> hat complexes for myc-dependent transcription and transformation in human cells and the synthetic lethality of gcn <dig> deletion and cg- <dig> treatment in yeast, it is likely that the effect of gcn <dig> knockdown  combined with cg- <dig> administration in myc-driven tumors will lead to the blockade of tumor progression.

gcn <dig> and pcaf have been shown to regulate transcription, mediated by other transcription factors, including e2f and p <dig>  <cit> . underlining the versatility of the human gcn <dig> homologs, gcn <dig> and pcaf have been shown to interact with brca <dig> and brca <dig>  respectively. these hats have been shown to modulate brca-mediated dna repair as well as their transcriptional activation function  <cit> . gcn <dig> is also a potential target for oncogenic egf signaling as it facilitates egf mediated transcription through localized acetylation  <cit> . gcn <dig> and pcaf appear to be good targets for cancer therapy since they are associated with several proto-oncogenes and are not frequently mutated in human cancers .

inhibitors for histone acetyltransferases are being developed and include garcinol and anacardic acid derivatives as well as synthetic inhibitors including isothiazolones, α-methylene-γ-butyrolactones, and the new pyridoisothiazolone-based inhibitors that appear to be very active inhibitors of pcaf . the γ-butyrolactone mb- <dig> has been characterized as a gcn <dig> inhibitor in vitro and may be a potential treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia   <cit> . gcn5/saga interacts and acetylates the oncogene e2a-pbx <dig> resulting in protein stabilization and in this context gcn <dig> inhibition results in decreased levels of the e2a-pbx <dig> oncogene  <cit> . however, as is the case with hdacis, specificity will have to be precisely determined. it will be important to determine the growth-inhibitory activity of gcn5/pcaf specific inhibitors in combination with cg- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have used a high throughput yeast deletion library screen to quantify strain growth after treatment with the hdaci cg- <dig> and have identified  <dig> sensitive strains and  <dig> resistant strains. biological processes including transcription and chromatin remodeling are highly represented in cg-1521-sensitive strains. in particular deletion of components of the saga complex, including gcn <dig>  confers sensitivity to cg- <dig>  the identification of potential pathways that modulate the response to cg- <dig> in yeast will allow the evaluation of combinatorial drug targets as well as resistance markers for cancer. based on this study we suggest that the use of hdac inhibitors in combination with gcn <dig> inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of a variety of cancers. these combination therapies may also provide novel therapeutic approaches for myc-driven tumors.
