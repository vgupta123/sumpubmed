BACKGROUND
hereditary spastic paraplegia  is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs owing to retrograde degeneration of the corticospinal axons  <cit> . spg <dig>  the gene most commonly involved in autosomal dominant hsp, encodes spastin, an atpase belonging to the aaa family  <cit> . spastin acts as a microtubule-severing protein, suggesting that axonal degeneration in hsp may depend on defective regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics in long axonal tracts  <cit> . the identification of several spastin molecular interactors involved in cell trafficking led to the proposal that the microtubule-severing activity of spastin may be coupled to specific processes and therefore, occur in a regulated manner  <cit> .

spastin has a complex subcellular localization. it is enriched in the centrosome in interphase and during mitosis, similarly to p <dig> katanin, another microtubule-severing protein  <cit> . low levels of spastin are present in the nucleus of proliferating cells, while neurons show a prevalent cytoplasmic localization  <cit> . we previously found that one mechanism to regulate targeting of spastin to specific cell compartments is the alternative initiation of translation from two augs present in exon  <dig> of the spg <dig> gene  <cit> . both spastin isoforms contain a nuclear localization signal, however, the long 68-kda spastin isoform also bears a nuclear export signal and is efficiently exported to the cytoplasm in an exportin-dependent fashion. conversely, the shorter 60-kda spastin isoform localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm upon over-expression in eukaryotic cells.

although both spastin isoforms efficiently sever microtubules  <cit> , they display several functional differences. first, the shorter isoform is the most abundant in all tissues examined, while the longer form is efficiently detectable only in brain and spinal cord  <cit> . second, two proteins, atlastin and na <dig>  have been shown to interact specifically to the n-terminal region of spastin present in the long isoform but absent in the short isoform  <cit> . since atlastin is in turn implicated in hsp, this observation may be of direct relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease. third, two polymorphisms  acting as phenotype modifiers have been identified in the long-isoform-specific region. patients carrying a mutated allele of spastin and one of these two polymorphisms on the other allele are affected by a severe disease with an early age of onset  <cit> . furthermore, a family has been described in which one patient with a late onset mild spastic paraplegia was homozygous for the s44l polymorphism  <cit> .

in vertebrates, initiator codons are recognized most efficiently within the context gccrccaugg, with the purine  in position - <dig> and the g in position + <dig> making the strongest contributions  <cit> . the main spg <dig> open reading frame  starts with an aug that resides in a context that deviates significantly from the consensus motif . moreover, an upstream orf  overlaps with the main spg <dig> orf and contains an aug in a good kozak's consensus sequence . it is expected that this uorf would drastically inhibit translation from the first spg <dig> aug, while allowing re-initiation at the second aug that has a g in position + <dig> and is located at a sufficient distance from the stop codon of the uorf . uorfs have been recognized in genes with regulatory function and may offer a mechanism to restrict expression of a toxic product  <cit> . in some cases, limited access to the main orf might be achieved by leaky scanning. in summary, the presence of a uorf that overlaps with the main spg <dig> orf, as well as the sequence context surrounding the first two augs in the main orf, may explain why translation of the long spastin isoform is strongly unfavored in vivo. consistent with this model, expression of an spg <dig> cdna containing the 5'-utr abundantly produces the shorter protein isoform and only a limited amount of the long 68-kda isoform  <cit> . moreover, in vitro transcription-translation assays using a cdna construct that starts from the first aug supported translation of both spastin isoforms, likely reflecting leaky scanning from the first aug  <cit> .

although the scanning mechanism for initiation of translation can satisfactorily explain our previous data, there might still be the possibility that translation of the short abundant 60-kda spastin isoform occurs via direct entry of the ribosomes at the downstream aug codon. albeit this mechanism is well documented for certain viral genes, it is still quite controversial as to whether it occurs in mammalian genes  <cit> .

while testing for the presence of an internal ribosome entry site  in the spg <dig> mrna, we found evidence for a cryptic promoter in exon  <dig>  responsible for the production of a shorter mrna specific for the 60-kda spastin isoform. this promoter shows some degree of tissue-specificity, providing a way to regulate the production of the different spastin isoforms.

RESULTS
translation of the 60-kda spastin isoform does not depend on an ires
translation of the 60-kda spastin isoform from the aug in position 259– <dig> may depend on the migration of the translational machinery until it meets this aug codon that lies in a better kozak's sequence context than the first aug . however, the program utrscan predicts a secondary rna structure compatible with the presence of an ires, immediately upstream of the second aug, suggesting that the short spastin isoform could be synthesized through a cap-independent mechanism. to test this possibility, we cloned the spg <dig> cdna sequence between the first and second atg into a widely used dicistronic vector, prf . this vector contains the sv <dig> promoter directing the expression of a dicistronic rna encoding the renilla luciferase as the first cistron and the firefly luciferase as the second. this plasmid was transfected in hela and sh-sy-5y neuroblastoma cell lines and the renilla and firefly luciferase activities were measured. the construct prf +4/+ <dig> displayed a high firefly activity in hela cells compared with the control empty vector , consistent with the possibility that the region between the two augs in the first exon of spg <dig> might contain a functional ires. this construct was less active in sh-sy-5y cells.

although the dicistronic test has been considered the gold standard for testing the existence of functional ires elements, a major drawback of this approach is that it cannot distinguish between ires activity and the presence of a cryptic promoter  <cit> . to exclude this possibility, we cloned the same spg <dig> sequence into a promoter-less prf vector , in which the sv <dig> promoter has been removed . both renilla and firefly luciferase activities were almost undetectable when the empty prfΔp vector was transfected, whereas a dramatic increase of firefly activity was observed for the prfΔp +4/+ <dig> construct in hela cells, strongly suggesting the presence of a promoter activity in the first exon of spg <dig> . again, the fold of activation was lower in sh-sy-5y cells .

the presence of a strong promoter in the region under analysis could mask the presence of the ires, hampering the detection of its functionality. to circumvent this problem, an effective method is direct transfection of the dicistronic rnas  <cit> . to this end, in vitro-transcribed capped dicistronic mrnas were transfected into hela cells and the activities of both renilla and firefly luciferases were measured. the firefly activities of both the empty vector and the prf +4/+ <dig> were barely detectable, while the renilla luciferase activities were comparable, indicating that the first exon of spg <dig> does not contain an ires element .

a minimal ubiquitous spg <dig> promoter
the finding of promoter activity in the region between the two atgs prompted us to study the regulatory sequences of the spg <dig> gene. bioinformatic analysis of the genomic region upstream of the transcriptional start site  does not identify any tata box, but detects several cg boxes and a caat box in position - <dig>  furthermore, sequence comparison between the human and mouse spg <dig> genomic sequence shows a high degree of sequence conservation in the 5'-utr of spg <dig> and in a region of  <dig> base pairs  upstream of the putative initiation of transcription, suggesting that this region may contain important regulatory elements .

to define the minimal genomic region that confers basic expression of the spg <dig> gene, we tested the ability of different fragments of the genomic region upstream of the first atg of the spg <dig> gene to drive the expression of the luciferase gene in transiently transfected hela, hek <dig> and sh-sy-5y cells . the activities of these promoters were measured by a luciferase assay and considered as fold of induction in respect to the activity of the empty vector. we did not find any cell-specific difference in the activities of the different fragments in the three cell lines . the construct that showed higher promoter activity was s -621/- <dig>  which contained the highly conserved,  <dig> bp-genomic region and the 5'-utr. inclusion of an additional  <dig> bp upstream of this region led to a certain decrease of promoter activity, while removal of a sequence of approximately  <dig> bp containing the caat box  did not reduce significantly the promoter activity. deletion of the 5'-utr and approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription initiation site  completely abolished promoter activity, while the removal of only the 5'-utr  reduced the basal transcriptional activity . these experiments identified a region of  <dig> bp upstream of the first atg as a minimal promoter region active in all cell lines tested and point to a role of the 5'-utr to sustain basic ubiquitous spg <dig> expression.

a tissue-specific cryptic promoter in the first exon of spg4
the promoter activity observed in the region within the two atgs in the experiments with the promoter-less prfΔp vector, as well as the role of the 5'-utr for basal expression, induced us to examine in detail the potential presence of regulatory sequences in exon  <dig>  we cloned different regions of the first exon of spg <dig> upstream of the firefly luciferase gene and tested their promoter activity in all cell lines . we found a strong promoter activity in both hela and hek <dig> cells in the region that starts immediately downstream of the putative transcriptional start site  and include both atgs  . this activity, although decreased, is still present in constructs that contain only the coding region  or the 5'-utr . we define the whole region between the canonical tss, as defined in public databases, and the aug in position 259– <dig>  as a cryptic promoter. notably, the activity of this cryptic promoter appears to display some degree of cell-line specificity, being highly functional in hela cells and hek <dig> and significantly less in sh-sy-5y cells , thus confirming our previous observations with the promoter-less dicistronic vector.

we used the transfac program to identify binding sites for known transcription factors in the cryptic promoter region. this allowed us to identify two putative sp <dig> binding sites that were conserved in the human and mouse genomes . site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert mutations into the upstream, the downstream, or both sp <dig> sites in the construct s -207/+ <dig>  transfection of the mutated constructs showed a significant reduction of the cryptic promoter activity in hela cells only when both sp <dig> sites are mutagenized .

we previously showed that when spastin is expressed in mammalian cells, two isoforms are produced, starting from the first and second methionine  <cit> . the amount of the shorter isoform increases when the 5'-utr is included in the construct  <cit> . in vitro transcription-translation experiments suggested that this is largely due to alternative initiation of translation  <cit> . however, our novel findings suggest that transcriptional regulation could contribute to the production of the shorter isoform through the use of the cryptic promoter. to test this possibility, we removed the cmv promoter from a cmv-spastin-gfp construct and analyzed the ability of the cryptic promoter  to drive the expression of the short spastin isoform after transfection in different cell lines. we found that a short spastin-gfp isoform, with a size consistent with initiation of translation at the second aug, is produced in this condition in hela, hek <dig> and murine spinal motoneuronal nsc <dig> cells . to confirm this data, we generated a construct containing the gfp reporter under the control of the cmv promoter followed by a stop codon and by the coding region of spastin . such a construct could express spastin only if the region between the first two atgs functions as a promoter. consistently, transfected cells with high levels of gfp expression showed low levels of spastin expression, detected with a specific antibody .

in conclusion, both reporter and expression studies with promoter-less constructs strongly indicate that the first spg <dig> exon contains a cryptic promoter that may contribute to produce the 60-kda isoform in several cell types in vivo.

two phenotype-modifier polymorphisms lie within the cryptic promoter
the s44l and p45q  polymorphisms in the spg <dig> gene act as phenotype-modifiers. patients that bear one of these polymorphisms and a canonical spg <dig> mutation on the other allele show an early age onset of hsp and rapid progression of symptoms  <cit> . since these nucleotide changes fall into the newly identified cryptic promoter, we tested their capability to affect the promoter activity. the polymorphisms were inserted by mutagenesis in the constructs s -207/+ <dig> and s +4/+ <dig> . the activity of these mutagenized promoters was tested in hela cells and compared with wild-type constructs. the presence of the c.131c>t substitution significantly diminished the activity of the promoter by about a half, while no effect was detected with the c.134c>a substitution . when the substitutions were inserted in the context of a larger promoter, also containing part of the ubiquitous minimal promoter , no change in activity was observed for either .

identification of an endogenous spg <dig> transcript specific for the short spastin isoform
the previous experiments strongly suggest the existence of a cryptic promoter in the first exon of the spg <dig> gene. differentially regulated, alternative tsss are a common feature in protein-coding genes and commonly generate alternative n-termini  <cit> . genome-wide analyses, using short tags derived from the 5'-ends of capped rnas , oligocapping methods and full-length cdna collections, can be publicly accessed in the cage analysis website and in the database of transcriptional start sites . we searched these databases for tsss within the human spg <dig> gene. remarkably, we found that both databases identify an alternative promoter located within exon  <dig>  downstream of the first atg, defined by a clustering of tsss separated by fewer than  <dig> bp. the tags derive from hek <dig> cells, as well as from different tissues, including brain tissue. a summary of these data is represented in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

to gain further experimental proof that the cryptic promoter is responsible for the synthesis of a short spg <dig> mrna, we performed 5'-end race experiments in both hela and sh-sy-5y cells. total rna was isolated from the cells. truncated or uncapped rna molecules were removed by a phosphatase treatment. subsequently, the caps were eliminated by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase , and an adapter oligonucleotide was ligated to the 5'-ends. after nested amplification with gene-specific primers located downstream of the second aug, we could amplify in hela cells a specific product of about  <dig> bp, which was absent from the minus tap control reaction . this product was cloned and sequenced and found to initiate from nucleotide + <dig>  this transcript therefore, contains an orf that starts with aug 259– <dig> and encodes the short 60-kda spastin isoform. both sp <dig> sites are located upstream of the beginning of the novel transcript, while the polymorphisms c.131c>t and c.134c>a appear to be positioned a few bases downstream . notably, this tss corresponds to two tags identified in hek <dig> in the dbtss database. we could not obtain a similar 5'-end race product in sh-sy-5y cells, consistent with the lower activity of the cryptic promoter in this cell line .

discussion
haplo-insufficiency of spastin causes hsp, suggesting that tight control of the protein levels is required for axonal integrity. we previously showed that the spg <dig> gene synthesizes two isoforms of spastin , depending on the alternative initiation of translation from two augs in the first exon  <cit> . regulation of the expression of protein isoforms simply based on inefficient translation or leaky scanning is, however, hard to achieve. here, we report a transcriptional mechanism of spg <dig> regulation that may contribute to the production of a different ratio of long and short spastin isoforms in tissues.

we identified a ubiquitous spastin minimal promoter and found evidence for a tissue-specific cryptic promoter in the first exon of the gene. an evolutionary highly conserved region of  <dig> bp upstream of the first in-frame aug of the spg <dig> gene was sufficient to provide basal expression in hela, hek <dig> and sh-sy-5y cells. this region does not contain a tata box, but includes several cis-acting, gc-rich elements, suggesting that the spg <dig> promoter belongs to the vast category of tata-less promoters common to mammalian housekeeping genes  <cit> . inclusion in the reporter constructs of upstream genomic regions did not significantly increase transcriptional activity. furthermore, deletion of a putative caat box, not conserved in the mouse, did not decrease substantially promoter activity. in contrast, a certain drop in activity was found when the majority of the 5'-utr of the gene was removed from all the constructs tested. a possible explanation is that the 5'-utr itself may contain additional tss or regulatory elements that cooperate with upstream sequences to allow basal transcription of the spg <dig> gene. consistently high levels of sequence conservation are observed in the 5'-utr among different species from human to chicken.

the latter hypothesis is supported by the finding of a cryptic promoter in the first exon of the spg <dig> gene. the region between the most upstream tss  and the first atg, and the region between the first and the second in-frame atgs, both, alone and even stronger in combination, are able to drive the expression of a reporter gene in promoter-less vectors. collectively, we define these regions in spg <dig> exon  <dig> as a cryptic promoter. furthermore, promoter-less constructs containing only the coding sequence of spastin drove the expression of the shorter spastin isoform in hela, hek <dig> and nsc <dig> cells. these are murine immortalized spinal motoneurons that express both long and short spastin isoforms  <cit> . this result suggests that the cryptic promoter may also be active in neurons implicated in human pathology. remarkably, the cryptic promoter shows some degree of tissue-specificity, as shown by low activity in the neuroblastoma-derived sh-sy-5y cells.

the presence of shorter capped spg <dig> mrnas is supported by the successful identification of a novel spg <dig> transcript that starts downstream of the first aug in hela cells by 5'-end race experiments. moreover, our experimental data are consistent with high-throughput, genome-wide studies, which identified a cluster of tsss within both the human and murine spg <dig> genes located in close proximity to the tss of the novel transcript identified in our study. the previous results strongly suggest that the spg <dig> gene has multiple core promoters containing multiple tsss, the use of which generates diversity, not only in the transcripts, but most importantly, in the proteins produced. a similar scenario is emerging with more and more frequency from studies of mammalian core promoters  <cit> . as expected for a broad promoter with multiple tsss, several cpg islands boxes and multiple binding sites for the transcription factor sp <dig> are present in the cryptic promoter. it has been suggested that sp <dig> may direct the basal machinery to form a pre-initiation complex within a loosely defined window  <cit> . mutagenesis of two evolutionary conserved sp <dig> sites decreased the activity of the cryptic promoter, suggesting that sp <dig> or sp family member transcription factors may bind to the cryptic promoter. sp <dig> elements are required for the expression of many ubiquitous, tissue-specific and viral genes  <cit> . interestingly, sp <dig> levels decrease with cellular aging  <cit> . further studies however, are required to define the transcription factors involved in spg <dig> expression.

western blot analysis strongly indicates that the 60-kda spastin isoform is predominant in many tissues and cells  <cit> . based on our data, we propose that a combination of transcriptional and translational mechanisms is employed in concert to modulate the levels of spastin isoforms in cells. at the transcriptional level, cells may synthesize the 60-kda isoform simply through the production of a shorter transcript that possesses as first in-frame aug, the one in position 259– <dig>  however, an additional mechanism to ensure preferential synthesis of the 60-kda spastin isoform likely arises during translation, due to several constraints imposed on translation from the first in-frame aug, such as the presence of a 73% gc-rich 5'-utr, an overlapping uorf and a poor kozak's context  <cit> . indeed, in our experiments with spastin expression constructs, it is clear that the short spastin isoform is expressed at high levels when the spg <dig> coding sequence is under the control of the cmv promoter, suggesting that translation of this isoform occurs even when the synthesis of a longer mrna is favored.

our study tends to exclude a role for a cap-independent mechanism through recognition of an ires in the translation of the spastin 60-kda short isoform. this latter mechanism has been extensively demonstrated in viral transcripts, and more recently has also been found in a number of eukaryotic transcripts, whose translation needs to occur also in circumstances in which cap-dependent translation is inhibited. functional ires elements have been proposed in several eukaryotic genes, but subsequent studies using more sensitive procedures have questioned the validity of several of them  <cit> . similarly, we showed by direct rna transfection of a dicistronic transcript that the predicted ires in the spg <dig> exon  <dig> is not functional, further confirming the imprecision of bioinformatic approaches to predict ires sequences and stressing the importance of adequate functional validation.

it remains to be established why several mechanisms have evolved to maintain the low levels of the long 68-kda spastin isoform in most cells and tissues. this apparently seems to contrast with the evolutionary conservation of the first aug and even of the uorf in several organisms, and may point to the need for a regulated expression of this isoform, or a possible toxic effect if expressed at a high level.

the identification of the cryptic spg <dig> promoter and a shorter spg <dig> transcript may have implications in human pathology. we found that a previously reported polymorphism  that acts as a disease modifier falls into the cryptic promoter region and decreases its activity significantly. notably, this polymorphism is a few base pairs downstream of the tss of the novel transcript described here and therefore, within a bona fide spg <dig> core promoter. however, a second polymorphism, c.134c>a, did not affect cryptic promoter activity, casting doubts on whether these polymorphisms actually act transcriptionally. further studies on cell lines derived from hsp families in which both a mutant spg <dig> allele and the polymorphism segregate are needed to address this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
our study describes alternative promoter usage and heterogeneity of transcription initiation for the spg <dig> gene. a canonical promoter has features typical of housekeeping genes, while a cryptic promoter in the 5'-utr and coding region of spastin seems to provide tissue-specificity. use of these alternative promoters generates spg <dig> mrnas with 5'-utrs of different length and with different augs driving the production of different spastin isoforms. our study emphasizes the need to take into account spg <dig> complex transcriptional regulation to achieve a better understanding of the biology of spastin and the pathogenic effect of mutations or polymorphisms located in the first exon of the gene.
