BACKGROUND
in the last quarter century, more than five hundred published manuscripts contained experiments using the popular rat crypt cell lines iec- <dig> and iec- <dig> originally established by quaroni and isselbacher in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . these lineages have stood the test of time as being two of the most reliable and phenotypically well-preserved gastrointestinal cell lines to date. in our lab, we utilize the iec- <dig> lineage because it is more robust in serum-restricted conditions and, in our experience, it is more suitable for correlation with distal intestinal crypt and enterocyte physiology than cell lineages derived from colonic tumors.

one of the more exciting aspects of iec- <dig> cells is their capacity to retain the crypt cell phenotype as well as the continued potential for differentiation/maturation into enterocytes  <cit> . however, as we have worked with this lineage over the years, the rare but unmistakable morphology of an occasional neuroendocrine-like cell, the suspicious frothiness of a possible paneth-like cell and the rare giant vacuole of a goblet cell precursor have prompted us to wonder how prevalent spontaneous differentiation towards other lineages and/or transformants might be .

this is a fairly crucial experimental question because serum-restricted conditions allow the tightest experimental rigor but may drive iecs towards altered cell fates, potentially introducing uncontrolled experimental confounders. until recently, we did not have the necessary tools with which to determine more subtle epigenetic divergences in iecs. our current investigation uses a novel strategy to demonstrate that spontaneous cell fate divergence is not only highly prevalent in iec- <dig> cells, but it is fairly uniform and therefore a predictable confounder for gene array studies in this cell line.

RESULTS
initial characterization of iec- <dig> culture heterotypy using immunolocalization
we have recently discovered a novel antigen localization pattern by using anti-carboxyl igf binding protein- <dig>  antibody  to demonstrate a multivesicular pattern in some iec- <dig> cells but not in others that are immediately adjacent . we note that anti-amino igfbp- <dig> showed no staining in iec- <dig> cells and that pretreatment with synthetic antigen abolished c <dig> staining , confirming that c <dig> is a carboxyl fragment of igfbp- <dig>  for the purpose of this study, we wanted to determine whether or not this heterotypy represented cell fate divergence or systemic pleiomorphism.

to further characterize the observed heterotypy, we examined iec- <dig> cells with anti-actin antibody in iec- <dig> cells without performing antigen retrieval and allowing the detection reaction to proceed until only a limited amount of staining is seen. when used with the right antibody, this technique is a means to visualize dynamic portions of actin filaments, such as stress fibers and the proximal ends of microvilli, because they lack the actin binding proteins that obscure the antigen. if the reaction is allowed to continue, eventually all actin filaments will stain. in the version that we use, the assay is a qualitative assessment of cytoskeletal turnover when we are comparing two adjacent cells . both stress fibers and microvilli are heavily stained and appear to have high turnover rates in cells that have c <dig> staining, but not in those without it . we note that the punctate dots of filamentous-actin corresponded with small microvilli in c <dig> positive cells and that the c <dig> negative cells had a paucity of microvilli on their surface – which was confirmed by focusing up and down the shafts of the microvilli .

iec- <dig> cells spontaneously lose c <dig> staining prior to confluence, despite 10% fbs
when iec- <dig> cells were plated at variable densities in 10% fetal bovine serum , we saw that all crypt cells were initially positive for c <dig> staining, but with increasing density there were increasing numbers of c <dig> negative cells . we also saw that c <dig> positive cells had increased staining intensity as they approached confluence. this experiment demonstrates two important points: first, that loss of c <dig> staining begins before confluence and second, that it can occur with comparable prevalence in the presence of fbs as it does in serum free media .

c <dig> positive cells and c <dig> negative cells are both capable of phenotype preservation during proliferation
to determine if the c <dig> positive and negative iec- <dig> cells were each capable of phenotype preservation during proliferation, igfbp- <dig> stained cells on coverslips were searched for mitotic cells in the stage of cytokinesis and their images were captured by digital photomicroscopy . in each case, all daughter cells had the same phenotype as their sister, confirming that both the c <dig> positive and c <dig> negative phenotypes are conserved in subsequent cycles of mitosis .

c <dig> positive cell abundance is increased in proportion to the efficacy of igf agonist treatment
because iec- <dig> cells grow best in the presence of high dose insulin, we suspected that crypt cell proliferation was dependent upon igf receptor stimulation. in general, differentiated and benignly transformed epithelial cells are less likely to proliferate upon reaching confluence, so we sought to preferentially drive crypt cell proliferation in a graded fashion using different igf receptor agonists . igf-ii analog, a weak agonist, reduced the crypt cell abundance while nbi  <dig>  increased it significantly and r3-igf-i doubled the number of crypt cells per 10x field  while none of the treatments significantly altered the abundance of c <dig> negative cells. this strategy allowed us to systematically skew the cell composition and use gene array analysis to determine whether c <dig> positive cells were epigenetically divergent.

our gene array methodology identified four candidate genes as potential markers of cell fate divergence in iec- <dig> culture
eleven genes met our criteria for a significant fold change, four were positively correlated with crypt cell abundance and seven were inversely correlated . of these first pass candidates, only six showed the appropriate fold trends across all treatment conditions, consistent with our hypothesis of constitutive expression that could reflect divergent cell fates. of these six, one was found to have a significant difference between igf-ii analog and sfm, suggesting a direct treatment effect by igf agonists but not by nbi  <dig> . enzymatic glycosylation-regulating gene is known to be an insulin responsive gene and was also excluded because of the high probability of a direct effect by our igf agonists  <cit> . of the four remaining candidates, one  had absolute values that bordered on background levels in the sfm, igf-ii analog and nbi  <dig> treatment conditions  and has had a relatively limited characterization in the literature  <cit> . we saw no obvious means for obtaining or generating an antibody to it and thought it unlikely to be a robust marker at the protein level, in large part because its message has only been found in brain thus far. another had high homology with the egf family and is currently a predicted protein based on genomic sequence  <cit> . however, the two remaining candidate genes we pulled out were well-characterized gut-related proteins .

immunolocalization for 5-ht2a and apc revealed  <dig> divergent phenotypes within iec- <dig> cell culture
western blots using antibodies against apc and 5-ht2a in iec- <dig> cell lysates revealed staining of the appropriate sized band for each . in the case of apc, there were several discrete smaller bands which were inversely proportional in abundance to the  <dig> kd full-sized protein  when compared across multiple samples . in the case of 5-ht2a, there was a single  <dig> kd band that was faint, suggesting relatively low abundance. both antibodies were deemed suitable for immunolocalization.

immunolocalization for apc revealed that c <dig> positive cells also had intense apc staining whereas c <dig> negative cells either had limited or no apc staining . this finding is in keeping with our gene array analysis and suggests that there is substantial and wide spread divergence of iec- <dig> crypt cells away from the crypt cell phenotype and towards an adenoma-like transformation.

immunolocalization for 5-ht2a demonstrated a second cell phenotype . we had previously noted rare neuroendocrine-like morphology characterized by spindle-shaped cells with bipolar, dendritic arbors , however with 5-ht2a immunostaining we found a mean of  <dig> positively stained cells per coverslip of confluent cells . 5-ht2a is present in high abundance within paneth and neuroendocrine cell types but is absent within small intestine crypt cells in vivo  <cit> . the cells that we observed appeared to be in transition, going from iecs to neuroendocrine-like cell morphology – with corresponding increases in staining intensity. while still a very low prevalence, the staining was quite intense in this small subset and was not detected in any of the adjacent cells.

double labeling confirms that c <dig> negative cells have diminished apc abundance
double immunolabeling with overlay technique  demonstrated that c <dig> negative cells have a paucity of microvilli in comparison to c <dig> positive cells . additionally, double labeling with c <dig> and apc demonstrated that c <dig> positive cells have uniform apc staining whereas c <dig> negative cell have variable and overall diminished staining in comparison . these experiments provide an objective demonstration that c <dig> positive cells retain the iec phenotype whereas c <dig> negative cell are undergoing transformation .

discussion
in this manuscript we have taken advantage of an iec immunolocalization marker that we call c <dig> to demonstrate two forms of cell fate divergence within iec- <dig> culture. using a combination of gene array screening and immunolocalization, we found that c <dig> is lost in over half the cells by the time of confluence and its loss is also associated with a down regulation of the apc gene, decreased apc protein abundance, decreased actin filament turn over, and reduced microvillar density. in short, there is an adenoma-like phenotype that fits with this genotype and this fits well with what is known about the function of the apc protein  <cit> . in addition, another cell genotype-phenotype correlate was detected by screening out the 5-ht2a gene and visualizing the cells that express its protein, i.e. neuroendocrine-like cells. these findings also fit well with cell phenotypes known to express 5-ht2a in the gut endoderm  <cit>  and strongly argue against the dogma that iecs persist as a single lineage prior to reaching confluence.

while we think our findings have important implications for the existing iec literature, the more important aspect of this manuscript may be in the methodology we have piloted. in many ways, cell culture, whether primary or immortalized, transformed or not, is by definition a model in flux. the progenitor lineage that a researcher starts with is rarely the hodge podge they end up with after a limited number of passages and it is common, if not expected that epigenetic drift will occur with each cell culture passage. however, what we describe in this manuscript is different in that iec- <dig> cells are displaying a uniform trend in cell fate divergence – a trend that can be modulated with igf. many if not most gut epithelial cell lines are igf  dependent for proliferation and thus are potentially vulnerable to this biological confounder. it will remain to be seen if other epithelial cell types have similar behaviors when examined in this fashion. conversely, there is also a positive light to our findings; iec- <dig> cells could be a compelling model for spontaneous adenomatous transformation because these adenoma-like cells are arising from a genetically competent progenitor prior to reaching confluence. to our knowledge, no such model with this property has been previously defined.

our study has notable weaknesses and strengths. first, we have identified two divergent cell fates but have only partially characterized them because we were focused on developing a viable screening methodology . second, we are using a rat gene array chip that has approximately  <dig> non-est genes per chip. this is not an exhaustive survey of the rat genome and it is possible that there are other cell fates present in iec- <dig> culture that we did not detect. third, our phenotype assays are based on immunolocalization, which is a semi-quantitative technique with regards to assessing protein abundance. however, in this case we are actually combining cell-to-cell differences in protein abundance with distinguishing morphologic characteristics  to delineate the phenotypes between adjacent cells. in short, what we are quantifying, in the case of adenoma-like cells, is the percentage of cells with a given phenotype. for this purpose, blinded immunolocalization is simple, quantitative and exceedingly efficient. the combined methodologies we chose result in a highly accurate technique for assessing divergence and their specificity can be bolstered by comparative studies of co-divergent markers . as for other positives, the methodology is relatively rapid and can detect low prevalence phenotypes . additionally, we have demonstrated that a transcriptional marker is not required to create an effective screen. what is required, and what should probably prompt a researcher to employ this methodology, is a probe, a phenotype, or a pleiotropism that results in a consistently heterogeneous and quantifiable pattern .

in closing, we point out one last caveat. gene array investigation is an evolving science but there remain three potential pitfalls for every new application: experimental design flaws, data integrity issues and biological misassumptions  <cit> . in this study, we used a well-accepted screening principle ; we included a paired reference standard for each treatment condition ; we increased the screening stringency by adding a requirement for parity in fold trend in accordance with changing cell compositions; and then confirmed our findings by phenotype assays. however, we demonstrated that a small minority of neuroendocrine-like cells were still able to significantly alter the outcome of our gene array screen . we conclude that even low frequency epigenetic events can be a serious biologic confounder of gene array studies in cell culture.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated a novel methodology for detecting and characterizing cell fate divergence in cell cultures derived from a common progenitor. the majority of iec- <dig> cells are transformed into adenoma-like cells in sfm. igf agonists reduce the rate of transformation by driving proliferation of the progenitor phenotype but do not prevent it. we also detected a very low incidence of differentiation toward a neuroendocrine-like cell type in these same cultures.
