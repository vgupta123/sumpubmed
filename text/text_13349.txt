BACKGROUND
df and dhf/dss are mosquito-borne infectious diseases transmitted by the vector ae. aegypti and have become a major global health concern. this mosquito vector is endemic in several regions of mexico, especially the south pacific coast  <cit> . df and dhf/dss occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, predominantly in urban and suburban areas. the illness is endemic in more than  <dig> cities in africa, america, the mediterranean region and southeast asia  <cit> . fifty million people are infected every year; approximately  <dig>  of them are hospitalized and between 5% and 15% die  <cit> . this viral illness is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms including high fever, severe headaches, extreme myalgias and arthralgias, retro-orbital pain, anorexia, gastrointestinal disturbances, exanthema, nausea and vomiting; a rash may appear three or four days after the fever begins  <cit> .

the infection caused by any of the four serotypes of denv confers specific permanent immunity to the virus but does not protect against the other serotypes  <cit> ; however, short-term cross-immunity against the other three serotypes has been reported  <cit> . people living in an endemic area can be infected with any of the four serotypes of denv and can even be simultaneously infected by two serotypes  <cit> . the relevance to pathology of the serotype and genotype of the infecting strain has been described several times  <cit> .

the increase in the number of dhf and dss cases worldwide is not fully understood. it was first explained by mutations making denv more virulent, but this hypothesis has not been supported. then, the "secondary infection" or "immune enhancement" hypothesis was proposed to explain the increased virulence of denv in patients with secondary infections. this hypothesis is still favoured  <cit> . however, observations in southeast asia, some pacific islands and the americas are not consistent with it, so it has been modified several times. advances in molecular biology have led to the recognition that some viral strains are more virulent than others  <cit> . the introduction of dhf into cuba in  <dig> was linked to the arrival of a southeast asian strain of denv- <dig> on the island  <cit> . subsequently, an extended outbreak of dhf/dss occurred in venezuela and mexico, and this was linked to the introduction of the same southeast asian strain of denv- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, a major epidemic of df due to denv- <dig> with the american genotype was reported in peru in  <dig>  about  <dig> years after an epidemic of denv- <dig>  <cit> . the american denv- <dig> genotype strains may have lacked the properties necessary to cause severe disease. the american genotype has been associated with mild disease , while the southeast asian genotype coincided with the appearance of dhf on the american continent  <cit> . on this basis, viral virulence and immune responses have been considered two major factors in the pathogenesis of dhf.

early phylogenetic studies organized denv sequences into clusters on trees and classified them into a series of genotypes or subtypes  <cit> . within denv- <dig>  six genotypes have been proposed, five of which occur in humans  <cit> . although the asian/american genotype originated in southeast asia and spread to the americas in the early 1980s  <cit> , the strains phylogenetically classified as asian i and asian ii are currently restricted to southeast asia  <cit> ; the american genotype is mostly found in the americas and its frequency is now decreasing; and the cosmopolitan genotype is widely distributed across the tropical and subtropical world  <cit> . denv- <dig> consists of five subtypes   <cit> . the denv- <dig> and - <dig> viruses are currently classified into four and two genotypes, respectively  <cit> .

as mentioned above, denv genotypes differ in virulence, including their human pathogenicities and epidemic potential. therefore, phylogenetic studies were conducted to determine the epidemic potential of denv isolates from veracruz and oaxaca. these studies were carried out using partial sequences of the genes encoding c-prm, ns <dig> and ns <dig>  c and prm were chosen because they represent a region that is commonly analyzed in studies of the molecular epidemiology of den  <cit> . ns <dig> and ns <dig> are important because they may be useful for determining the genotype and may help us to establish additional specific genetic markers. also, ns <dig> has more nucleotide substitutions  <cit>  and five of the eight amino acid differences between the american and asian genotypes are located in the n terminus of this protein  <cit> . the rdrp of ns <dig> is crucial for viral rna replication. ns <dig> also contains an mtase domain that is essential for the interaction with rdrp required for virus replication and/or infectivity  <cit> . in addition, ns <dig> has been used thoroughly in studies of flavivirus phylogenies  <cit> .

the interdomain  region 169– <dig> of ns <dig> and the two loops that encircle the entrance of the atp binding pocket  <cit>  were also studied because of the role of this protein in virus replication. this region has also been implicated in the intrinsic flexibility that couples movements between the ns <dig> protease and helicase domains  <cit> .

in summary, phylogenetic and genetic analyses of oaxaca and veracuz virus isolates reveal the putative geographic origins of the viruses and potential molecular determinants of virulence.

RESULTS
virus isolation and serotyping
the mac-elisa test has been implemented by the ministry of health in mexico for diagnosing denv infections  <cit> . patients whose clinical reports show symptoms of dhf are exclusively evaluated using an igg-elisa kit. reported cases are under-notified and the circulating serotype is not widely known. analysis of the circulating serotype is important since it has been observed that den cases in mexico are increasing annually . this figure also shows that the percentage of dhf cases has increased in comparison to df cases  <cit> .

the serotypes of  <dig> denv samples from different sites in oaxaca and veracruz states, mexico  were evaluated and the results are shown in figure  <dig>  serotyping was performed by rt-pcr using the rna obtained from isolates in c6/ <dig> cells; each test to determine serotype was repeated at least twice. c6/ <dig> cells were chosen because the nucleotide sequence of the virus genome is conserved  <cit> .

out of  <dig> isolates from oaxaca,  <dig> were diagnosed with dhf;  <dig> were serotype  <dig> and six were serotype  <dig> . among the  <dig> isolates obtained from patient sera in veracruz state, fifteen with dhf were serotype  <dig>  two were serotype  <dig> and the isolate ver/mex013a/ <dig> showed both serotypes  <dig> and  <dig> 

out of a total of  <dig> isolates with df,  <dig> were serotype  <dig>  seven serotype  <dig>  eight serotype  <dig> and two serotype  <dig> . known strains of denv- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were used as positive controls for the rt-pcr assays.

phylogenetic analysis of oaxaca isolates
portions of the c91-prm <dig>  ns <dig>  ns <dig> and ns <dig> genes were amplified and sequenced as described in the methods section. fourteen sequences were obtained from  <dig> isolates from oaxaca and  <dig> from veracruz for the c-prm fragment ;  <dig> sequences were obtained from  <dig> oaxaca isolates and  <dig> from veracruz isolates for the mtase domain  fragment ;  <dig> sequences were obtained from  <dig> oaxaca isolates and  <dig> from veracruz isolates for the rdrp domain  fragment ;  <dig> sequences were obtained from  <dig> oaxaca isolates for the helicase domain fragment .

phylogenetic analysis was then performed on these sequences, including other prototype sequences of characterized isolates for denv- <dig> .

this analysis showed that c91-prm <dig>  ns <dig> and ns <dig> in the denv- <dig> isolates from oaxaca and veracruz were most closely related to strains from the caribbean islands cuba, dominican republic and martinique . the phylogenetic tree for ns <dig> and ns <dig> is not shown. the strains from brazil, venezuela and jamaica formed an independent clade. interestingly, analysis of c91-prm <dig> showed that the isolates obtained in  <dig> belonged to a different clade from those obtained in 2005– <dig>  with a high bootstrap support of 94%.

phylogenetic analysis of ns <dig> gave a somewhat different pattern: essentially, the isolates belonged to the same clade as those from venezuela, brazil and jamaica and were distinct from the caribbean islands isolates . bootstrap support was maintained in this analysis.

all the genotypes clustered in separate branches with high bootstrap support, as previously shown in phylogenetic analysis of other virus sequences  <cit> . our analysis supports the view that the asian/american strains are phylogenetically different from the main asian and american genotypes.

sequence analysis of oaxaca isolates
most of the amino acid  differences were associated with nucleotide changes in the prm fragment . in addition, phylogenetic analysis of ns <dig> showed low variability . tables  <dig> and  <dig> summarizes the aa changes among the asian i, asian ii, cosmopolitan, american and american/asian genotype viruses. we compared the aas related to c91-prm <dig>  ns <dig>  ns <dig> and ns <dig> in all southeast asian genotype viruses with american genotypes . the former have greater potential to cause dhf while the latter are associated with df  <cit> . the oaxaca isolates in this study and all genotypes with potential to produce dhf contained valine at position  <dig> in c-prm , except for the isolate s707oax05/mex, which contained threonine at this position as did in the american genotype. in addition, the oaxaca isolates in this study and all genotypes with potential to produce dhf contained isoleucine, lysine and glutamine at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively in ns <dig>  in contrast, the american genotype had valine, arginine and leucine at these positions.

frequency analysis included in addition to the sequences of table  <dig>  one sequence with asian ii genotype  and twelve with cosmopolitan genotype . in addition to the sequences in table  <dig>  it was included  <dig>  from veracruz and  <dig>  from oaxaca in rdpd domain; and  <dig> from oaxaca in the helicase domains.

interestingly, the oaxaca isolates in this study and the caribbean islands strains contained valine at position  <dig> in c91-prm <dig> with a frequency of  <dig>  in the asian/american genotype, while all other genotypes had isoleucine at this position . all american/asian viruses had valine, alanine and glycine at positions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, with a frequency of  <dig>  and isoleucine at position  <dig>  with a frequency of  <dig>  because huat2/mex/ <dig> had leucine at this position. the cosmopolitan genotype had valine and alanine at positions  <dig> and  <dig> with a frequency of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . american viruses had lysine and threonine at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, with a frequency of  <dig>  three isolates from oaxaca  <dig> also contained lysine at position  <dig> , resulting in a frequency of  <dig>  in the asian/american genotype. asian i genotype viruses had serine and isoleucine at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  with frequencies of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the other genotypes did not contain these amino acids. cosmopolitan viruses had methionine and asparagine at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  with a frequency of  <dig>  in this genotype. the other genotypes did not contain this aa.

the american/asian genotype viruses contained isoleucine, lysine, threonine, alanine and valine at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in ns <dig>  with a frequency of  <dig> for positions  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig>  for the positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . asian i contained the same aa at position  <dig> with a very low frequency of  <dig>  in this genotype. interestingly, our analysis showed that the asian i genotype, unlike the others, had alanine at position  <dig> in ns <dig> rather than threonine with a frequency of  <dig> . furthermore, the american genotype had valine, arginine, serine and leucine with a frequency of  <dig> at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in ns5; none of the other genotypes has these aas at these positions, resulting in a frequency of  <dig> .

american/asian and cosmopolitan genotypes had arginine at position  <dig> with a frequency of  <dig> in ns <dig> . oaxaca isolates had lysine and threonine at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in ns <dig> with frequencies of  <dig>  and  <dig> . oaxaca and veracruz isolates had valine and proline at positions  <dig> in ns <dig> and  <dig> in ns <dig> with frequencies of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively in the asian/american genotype. lysine at position  <dig> in ns <dig> may be signature of the oaxaca strains, and valine and proline at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in ns <dig> may be signatures for the oaxaca and veracruz strains.

it is evident that the genotypically different strains contain specific aas that may be used as genotype markers.

discussion
the pan american health organization  led a campaign to exterminate ae. aegypti, which resulted in the eradication of yf and disappearance of df in america. ae. aegypti was absent from mexico in  <dig> until  <dig>  because the mosquito was not completely exterminated in america and the campaigns were gradually relaxed, ae. aegypti reappeared in most countries. there was a denv- <dig> outbreak in mexico in  <dig> and epidemics spread throughout the country. the first reports of outbreaks of denv- <dig> were in  <dig> and  <dig>  with  <dig>  and  <dig>  cases respectively. there were  <dig> reported dhf cases and  <dig> deaths associated with denv- <dig> in mexico in  <dig>  four dhf cases and one death were reported in  <dig> and  <dig> cases in  <dig>  denv- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were isolated in  <dig>  and denv- <dig> was reported in  <dig>  furthermore, denv- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were isolated in  <dig>  <cit> . this data shows that even when denv serotypes were co-circulating in mexico, dhf cases were rare, suggesting that simultaneous circulation of several serotypes  is not necessarily sufficient to cause dhf epidemics in the absence of highly virulent strains, as previously reported  <cit> . interestingly, the denv- <dig> american genotype was replaced by the asian/american genotype over this period. df and dhf epidemics increased dramatically in the closing decades of the 20th century, especially in the new world, and mexico was not excluded  <cit> . furthermore, in south texas , all dengue serotypes have circulated periodically, but locally acquired dhf has been recently reported  <cit> . the causes of this increased incidence of denv infection, apart from the introduction of the denv- <dig> asian genotype, include demographic, cultural, environmental and political changes. this is clearly shown in figure 1; df and dhf cases have increased significantly since  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the proportion of dhf to df cases has also increased , as in thailand, where three denv- <dig> genotypes have circulated but only viruses assigned to asian genotype i have been sampled from the population since  <dig>  <cit> . the genotype distribution in mexico is mostly unknown; consequently, it is very important for epidemiological studies to determine the serotypes and genotypes of the viruses circulating in this country to contribute to the knowledge of geographic distribution, evolution and dispersion of denv; besides, knowing the virus genotype may allow doctors to judge the risk of dhf to the patient. this may also be useful for laboratory diagnosis, which is an issue of serious concern in all endemic countries; diagnosis may well help in the rigorous follow-up of patients and could save them from the most severe den infection  and death.

our results showed that dhf was associated with denv- <dig> and - <dig> and one case showed both serotypes . interestingly, we observed no dhf cases associated with denv- <dig>  as has been shown in epidemiological studies in mexico  <cit> . recently, denv- <dig> has been isolated in brazil but its association with dhf has not been clearly established  <cit> . in contrast, denv- <dig> was associated with dhf in an outbreak in cuba  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis using portions of c91-prm <dig>  ns <dig>  ns <dig> and ns <dig> showed no substantial differences .

in this study, we detected the amino acids glutamic acid and valine in place of lysine and threonine at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in prm. these aas have been described as specific for the asian strains correlated with dhf  <cit> . ns <dig> also contains lysine  <dig>  arginine  <dig> and glutamic acid  <dig> in the mtase domain, essential for the interaction with rdrp required for virus replication and/or infectivity  <cit> . these three aas are conserved in all sequences of all strains or isolates.

we detected lysine and glutamine at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of ns5; these have been reported as markers of the asian and asian/american denv- <dig> genotypes that have the potential to produce dhf  <cit> . the interdomain  region 169– <dig> and the two loops that encircle the entrance of the atp binding pocket of ns <dig>  <cit>  were also studied because of the role of this protein in virus replication. this region has also been implicated in the intrinsic flexibility required to couple movements between the ns <dig> protease and helicase domains  <cit> . we found no change in these amino acids. however, at position  <dig> in the helicase domain, alanine  was replaced by threonine  in the isolates in this study and in one strain from china . it would seem important to study the structure of this region to determine whether this aa has any role in the enzymatic activity or in maintaining the protein structure.

the ns <dig> polymerase fragment  contains conserved aas: cysteine at position  <dig>  which participates in the zinc pocket; threonine  <dig> to aspartic acid  <dig> and arginine  <dig> in the priming loop motif; and arginine  <dig>  threonine  <dig>  tryptophan  <dig> and serine  <dig>  which are involved in gtp binding. however, the aa at position  <dig> in the priming loop is changed from threonine  to alanine  in the asian/american strains including our isolates . it would seem important in the future to study the structure around this region to determine the function of this amino acid, particularly whether it has any role in polymerase activity  <cit> .

a dramatic observation was obtained from the analysis of longitudinally sampled data on a temporal scale, where individual lineages or entire clades of viruses frequently arise, persist for a period of time and then disappear  <cit> . all strains analyzed in this work clustered in one branch with the asian/american strains. previously, in a survey during  <dig> by the department of health  <cit> , we reported this genotype in isolates from oaxaca on the basis of the protein c sequence and a fragment of the prm gene . the finding of the same asian/american genotype in the isolates from the  <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks indicates that they circulated and became prevalent in oaxaca and veracruz states; however, the isolates in this study were grouped with the strains from the caribbean islands, and the  <dig> isolates with the jamaica strain, with a high consistency of 94%. also, these 2005– <dig> isolates from oaxaca and veracruz showed valine in position  <dig> in prm, which was also shown by the caribbean islands strains. these isolates also clustered with the caribbean islands strains cuba  <dig>  dominican republic  <dig> and martinique  <dig> in the phylogenetic analysis of ns <dig> and ns <dig> , supporting this view of their geographic origin . all trees clearly distinguish among the five genotypes of denv- <dig>  as reported previously  <cit> , with strong bootstrap support . little is known of the history of this american/asian signature circulating in the caribbean islands. however, rodriguez-roche et al.  <cit>  found that clinical severity increased over time during the epidemics expressed by a higher ratio dhf to df for the cuban strains.

apparently, there has been a clade replacement of the american genotype for the asian/american genotype originated in southeast asia in oaxaca  and lately that strains were substituted for the oaxaca strains  with the probable origin in the caribbean islands, possibly cuba . furthermore, the geographic origin of the veracruz strains may be also the caribbean islands.

since analysis of the  <dig> c-prm sequences showed that all asian/american viruses had valine, alanine, glycine and isoleucine at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  with a frequency of  <dig>  while none of the other genotypes had these aas, they may be used as signatures of this genotype. the signature for american genotype viruses may be threonine at position  <dig>  since none of the other genotypes had this amino acid. the signature for the asian i genotype viruses may be serine at position  <dig>  with a frequency of  <dig> 

from the  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences analyzed, all asian/american genotype viruses contained isoleucine, lysine, threonine, alanine, lysine and valine at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and none of the other genotypes had these aas. our analysis also showed that the asian i genotype, unlike the others, had alanine at position  <dig> . the american genotype had valine, arginine, serine and leucine with frequency of  <dig> at positions <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but none of the denv- <dig> genotypes had it. all aas specific for a genotype may be used as signatures for that genotype. although fewer sequences were analyzed than for c-prm, because these genes have been less studied and consequently fewer sequences have been reported. the asian  <dig> and cosmopolitan genotypes showed no specific signature in the present study. this may be attributable to the broad spectrum of the cosmopolitan genotype strains and the low number of asian  <dig> sequences reported.

lysine at position  <dig> in ns <dig> may be signature of the oaxaca strains, and valine and proline at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in ns <dig> may be signatures for the oaxaca and veracruz strains, since none of the other genotypes or strains from the asian/american genotype had these aas.

some of the observed changes in the viruses could be due to mosquito adaptation as well as to the vertebrate hosts, since there is evidence that strains of denv- <dig> may differ in their ability to infect ae. aegypti  <cit> , perhaps through specific virus-cell receptor interactions  <cit>  by strong selection, or competition between denv serotypes  <cit> . it has been suggested that the asian genotype may spread more readily because it infects ae. aegypti mosquitoes more efficiently than the american genotype  <cit> .

the amino acid changes between the isolates of this study and those from  <dig> may be due to a high mutation rate  <cit>  or recombination  <cit>  contributing to the generation of new biologically successful strains.

phylogenetic analysis of the c91-prm <dig>  ns <dig>  ns <dig> and ns <dig> sequences in the denv- <dig> isolates demonstrated that the asian/american genotype is circulating in oaxaca and veracruz, showing specific amino acid changes that may be used successfully as genotype markers. differences in the ns <dig> tree, which showed that the isolates in this study clustered with the strains from the contained american genotype, may be due to the low variability of this domain. in addition, this analysis shows a clear correlation between genetic diversity and geographical location. as has been suggested previously  <cit> , viral dispersion may play a significant role in generating new varieties and effects on people who contract the illness.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that denv- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are circulating in oaxaca and denv- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in veracruz , resulting in many dhf cases . eight dhf cases were associated with denv- <dig>   <dig> with denv- <dig> and one case with both denv- <dig> and - <dig>  the origin of the isolates in this study appears to be linked to the signature from the caribbean islands genotypes. our results confirm that dhf is endemic in oaxaca and veracruz states and that the presence of the denv- <dig> asian/american genotype and denv- <dig> contributes to the increased number of dhf cases, a finding linked to the epidemiological data showing an increase in the ratio of dhf to df cases in 2005– <dig>  we also identified amino acids encoded in c91-prm <dig>  ns <dig>  ns <dig> and ns <dig> that are specific to the asian/american strains; and one amino acid specific to the isolates of this study and the caribbean islands strains. these aas may be used as markers of genotypes and geographic origins.
