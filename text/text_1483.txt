BACKGROUND
inlb is a surface-associated or secreted protein that mediates uptake of the pathogen listeria monocytogenes into normally non-phagocytic cells by specifically stimulating the receptor tyrosine kinase met on host cells  <cit> . inlb consists of an internalin domain, a b-repeat and three gw domains  <cit> . the internalin domain can be subdivided into an n-terminal helical cap domain, a leucine-rich repeat domain and an immunoglobulin-like inter-repeat  domain. the function of most domains in inlb has been tested using n-terminal, c-terminal or internal deletions, or by expression of the isolated respective domains  <cit> . using this approach the biochemical properties of the cap + lrr fragment, the ir domain, the b-repeat, the gw <dig> module and the gw2 + gw <dig> pair were addressed. these experiments showed that a cap + lrr fragment is sufficient for met binding, but that the ir domain also contacts the receptor and contributes to met activation  <cit> . the other domains  enhance met activation by binding to co-receptors other than met on host cells  <cit> .

in the past, the cap and lrr domains have only been investigated together as a single unit, which appears reasonable from a structural point of view. in general, lrr proteins have specialized n- and c-terminal capping structures adjacent to the lrr domain that are thought to serve a structural role by shielding the hydrophobic core of the lrrs from solvent  <cit> . in inlb, the lrr and its flanking cap and ir domain share a single hydrophobic core, forming the internalin domain  <cit> . deletion of the c-terminal capping structure, the ir domain, does not disturb the structure of the lrr, as inlb <dig> and inlb <dig>  two different constructs lacking the ir domain, yield functional proteins  <cit> . nevertheless the ir domain contributes significantly to the stability of inlb towards chemical and thermal denaturation  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, biochemical experiments involving an internalin lrr domain lacking its n-terminal cap have not been reported. one would expect that deletion of the n-terminal cap would result in misfolding and aggregation or degradation of the lrr domain. this assumption is corroborated by the finding that inlb folds along a polarized pathway from the n- to the c-terminus  <cit> . an attempt to express a cap-less inlb in e. coli resulted in insoluble protein  <cit> . as a consequence, the function in receptor activation of the cap and the lrr domain of inlb has so far never been investigated individually.

RESULTS
generation and biochemical characterization of yopm-inlb
to address a potential interaction of the inlb cap domain with a binding partner from the host cell, we sought to replace the cap by a structurally unrelated domain that still initiates folding. yopm is a leucine-rich repeat protein from yersinia enterocolitica with  <dig> lrrs, each  <dig> or  <dig> residues in length  <cit> . the repeats in yopm are most similar to those of the internalins like inlb  <cit>  and the overall horseshoe-shaped structure of yopm resembles that of the  <dig> lrr internalin inla  <cit> . however, the n-terminal capping structures of l. monocytogenes internalins and y. eneterocolitica yopm are structurally different. the cap domain of inlb resembles a truncated ef-hand motif consisting of three short helices and a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet  <cit> , while that of yopm consists of two longer α-helices connected by a single loop  <cit> . in inlb the cap is structurally closely linked to the first lrr. residues  <dig> and  <dig> from lrr <dig> are alanine and valine instead of leucine or isoleucine in other lrrs. as a consequence, the hydrophobic core of lrr <dig> is loosely packed and the side chain of phe <dig> from the cap fills the resulting hole. the capping domain of yopm does not provide a large side chain to fill the gap in lrr <dig> of inlb. we thus reasoned that replacing lrr <dig> along with the capping domain might increase protein stability. this, furthermore, allowed an ecori site in inlb to be used in cloning. the hybrid protein combines residues 34– <dig> of yopm with residues 93– <dig> of inlb and will be referred to as yopm-inlb . the protein was produced as gst-fusion and was purified like the inlb internalin domain  despite having a higher tendency to precipitate. nevertheless, between  <dig> and 20 mg of pure yopm-inlb were obtained per litre of bacterial culture. the protein eluted as a single symmetric peak from gel filtration . we used differential scanning fluorimetry  to assess the thermal stability of yopm-inlb and other inlb variants. with a melting temperature  of  <dig> °c  yopm-inlb was destabilized by about 2 k with respect to inlb <dig> containing the native n-terminal cap ). yopm-inlb is considerably more stable than inlb <dig> ), a truncated form lacking the ir domain, which acts as c-terminal capping structure  <cit> . two variants with an additional lrr inserted after the first lrr that bind and activate met like wild type inlb <dig> <cit>  showed melting temperatures close to that of inlb <dig> or yopm-inlb ; tm of inlb321 + 1lrrb was  <dig> °c ). the results from dsf presented here are in good agreement with the endothermic denaturation transitions from differential scanning calorimetry reported previously for inlb <dig>  and for inlb <dig>   <cit> . small differences between the previous and our results may be due to different buffers or the different short inlb constructs .

structure of yopm-inlb
we crystallized the yopm-inlb hybrid protein and solved its structure by molecular replacement. the numbering of both fragments in the pdb file corresponds to that of the proteins from which they were derived. the gap in numbers between the consecutive residues pro <dig> and gly <dig> represents the fusion point of pro <dig> derived from yopm and directly adjacent gly <dig> derived from inlb. no residues are actually missing in between.

the structure of yopm-inlb at  <dig>  Å resolution  confirms that this designed chimeric protein is properly folded . the electron density is very well defined with exception of the n-terminal residues , two residues  in the loop connecting the two helices of the yopm cap domain and glu <dig> and tyr <dig>  the first two residues of inlb directly after the fusion site. structural alignment of the n-terminal cap structure and the first lrr of yopm  with the hybrid protein results in an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> common cα atoms . the largest deviations are located in the loop region connecting the two helices . structural alignment of inlb <dig>  and the yopm-inlb hybrid protein for the region comprising residues 93– <dig> results in a coordinate r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> common cα atoms . there are major shifts between wild type inlb and the hybrid protein in residues on the concave face of lrr <dig>  for the three surface exposed residues  the cα atoms are shifted by  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively . the side chains of inlb gln <dig> and asn <dig> form hydrogen bonds to thr <dig> and his <dig> of met, respectively, in the crystal structure of the inlb:met complex  <cit> . due to their relative shift, the equivalent atoms in the corresponding residues in yopm-inlb would no longer be able to form these hydrogen bonds . moreover, the structural differences between yopm-inlb and wild type inlb are not limited to lrr <dig>  which was replaced by the yopm sequence. instead rearrangements extend to lrr <dig> and to a lesser extent to lrr <dig>  e.g. the cα of phe <dig>  a residue located in the β-strand of lrr <dig> and essential for the binding of met  <cit> , is shifted by some  <dig>  Å . we had not anticipated this medium range effect, which can in retrospect be explained by a slightly lower curvature in the n-terminal region of the protein due to the absence of a  <dig> helix in the first lrr of yopm. with only  <dig> residues,  the first lrr of yopm is among the shortest lrrs known and it forms an extended rather than a helical structure on the convex face.

yopm-inlb has reduced affinity for met
to assess whether the exchange of lrr <dig> and the unexpected structural changes in the β-sheet region of lrr <dig> and lrr <dig> impact met binding, we investigated complex formation between the met ectodomain and yopm-inlb by analytical gel filtration . we compared the elution profile of a stoichiometric 1: <dig> mixture of met and yopm-inlb to that of met and inlb <dig>  wild type inlb <dig> quantitatively shifted to lower elution volume indicating formation of a high affinity complex with the met ectodomain, as observed previously  <cit> . in contrast, the peak for yopm-inlb did not disappear, but was broadened and became asymmetric . the observed fronting and the shift to a slightly lower elution volume indicated weak binding of yopm-inlb to met and separation of the complex during the gel filtration run.

next, we analysed the met-binding ability of yopm-inlb in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  using immobilized met ectodomain and soluble glutathione-s-transferase -fusion protein of the two inlb variants . binding affinity of yopm-inlb was strongly reduced compared to that of inlb <dig>  the titration with yopm-inlb did not reach saturation at 3 μm, the highest concentration tested . this is probably due to a high off-rate and perturbation of the binding equilibrium in the washing steps of the elisa. thus binding of yopm-inlb could not be quantitated reliably. however, our data from gel filtration and elisa suggest that the binding affinity of yopm-inlb for met may be several orders of magnitude weaker than that of wild type inlb, which has an affinity in the low nanomolar range  <cit> .

yopm-inlb is at least 10-fold less active in met phosphorylation than wild type inlb321
inlb <dig> is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of met and its downstream target erk  <cit> . here, we used erk phosphorylation as readout for met activation . the shorter construct inlb <dig> that has the same affinity for met as inlb <dig> but no biological activity  <cit>  was used as negative control. inlb <dig> induced erk phosphorylation in vero cells at a concentration of 10−7 m. like the negative control inlb <dig>  yopm-inlb remained inactive even at a tenfold higher concentration. given the reduced affinity of yopm-inlb for met, this result is not unexpected. it is presumable due to the significantly lower affinity for met.

a yopm-inlb hybrid including the inlb c-terminal domains induces cell scatter though less efficiently than wild type inlb
although inlb <dig> does stimulate phosphorylation of met and erk, it does not induce cell scatter, in contrast to full-length inlb   <cit> . to test whether the endogenous cap domain of inlb is essential for induction of a cellular response, we replaced the cap domain of inlb-fl by that of yopm . as a readout, we used the well-established madin darbey canine kidney  cell scatter assay . yopm-inlb-fl induced the dispersal of mdck cell colonies down to a concentration of 10−9 m but was inactive at 10−10 m, the lowest concentration at which wild type inlb-fl displayed activity. thus, yopm-inlb-fl is about one order of magnitude less active than wild type inlb-fl.

discussion
the internalin domain is a versatile framework allowing targeted manipulations
lrr proteins are promising targets for protein engineering and protein design because of their modular architecture. synthetic libraries of designed lrr proteins have been used as artificial binders that might replace antibodies  <cit> . some of the first structures of toll-like receptors  were obtained with protein chimeras that combine the ligand-binding lrrs from tlrs with cap structures from variable lymphocyte receptors  from hagfish  <cit> . the cap swap strategy presented here allows addressing the biological function of the n-terminal cap of internalins that cannot be studied with simple domain deletion constructs due to its contribution to protein folding. this approach is not limited to inlb but can similarly be applied to other internalins, as their cap and lrr domains are closely related. a potential biological function on top of that in protein folding could also be studied for the cap domain of the yersinia protein yopm, by reversing the direction of the domain swap. in a related approach the cap domain of inlb along with lrr <dig> and lrr <dig> was fused to the ectodomain of vlrs in order to obtain proteins with favourable physicochemical properties  <cit> .

the inlb cap domain is not essential for met activation
met only interacts with the lrr and ir but not with the cap domain of inlb  <cit> . the reduced affinity of yopm-inlb for met is presumably due to the exchange of the first lrr along with the cap domain resulting in spatial shifts of residues from lrr <dig>  lrr <dig>  and lrr <dig>  whose side chains are involved in met binding. the difference in affinity for met between wild type and cap variant precludes a straightforward interpretation of the results from cellular assays. the failure of yopm-inlb to stimulate met phosphorylation at a 10-fold higher concentration than required for inlb <dig> can presumably be ascribed to the reduced met affinity. still, the colony scatter experiments allow the conclusion that the cap is not essential for met activation, although some contribution to receptor activation cannot be excluded conclusively from our experiments. previous data had already shown that mutation of the potential calcium binding sites in the inlb cap domain has no appreciable effect on met activation  <cit> . our results extend this observation and show that, as long as a stable protein is formed, the cap domain as a whole can be replaced without causing a complete loss of activity.

comparing the results of met phosphorylation induced by yopm-inlb with cell scatter induced by yopm-inlb-fl shows that interaction of the c-terminal domains with their cellular receptors  and the resulting avidity effect compensate the low affinity for the met ectodomain at least partially. this resembles observations made with multiple arginine mutations preventing formation of an inlb dimer contact required for met dimerization and activation. these mutations resulted in a more drastic effect in the isolated internalin domain  than in inlb-fl  <cit> . one might conclude that interaction of various inlb domains with multiple host cell receptors endues inlb with a built-in redundancy that is able to offset a loss of affinity in one of the domains.

outlook
the modular design of lrr proteins does not only make them prime targets of rational protein design, but also renders them attractive model systems to investigate protein folding. the folding of both inlb  <cit>  and yopm  <cit>  has been studied extensively. hence, fusion proteins like the one presented here that combine the n-terminal cap domain of one with the lrr domain of the other protein might represent new opportunities to address the importance of the n-cap for folding.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this work was to replace the endogenous n-terminal cap structure of inlb by a structurally unrelated capping unit from another lrr protein in order to separate its structural role as folding nucleus from a potential role as binding site for an interaction partner. conceptually, this aim was reached. the designed hybrid protein was folded and stable as shown by dsf, the single symmetric peak in gel filtration and the high-resolution crystal structure. in this particular case, the hybrid protein was not ideally suited for the intended functional studies, because it had reduced affinity for its receptor met. hence, the interpretation of results from cellular assays is not straightforward. however, our approach is not limited to inlb but can similarly be applied to other internalins and related lrr proteins.
