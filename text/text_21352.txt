BACKGROUND
overall decreases in fertility and mortality rates have aged the world’s population  <cit> . generalized and progressive tissue deterioration with aging is associated with impaired stress responses and results in increased risk of chronic diseases  <cit> . the increasing number of elderly people has therefore raised public health concerns and highlighted the necessity of interventions to attenuate age-related dysfunctions.

dietary restriction  is one of the best characterized strategies that promote healthy aging. dr is defined as a reduction in food intake without malnutrition. this nutritional intervention prolongs lifespan in a variety of species  <cit> , while also reducing fertility  <cit> . dr acts by promoting stress response pathways and preventing age-related functional decline, delaying the appearance of cardiovascular diseases, type  <dig> diabetes, and neurodegeneration in mammals, including non-human primates  <cit> . in c. elegans, different protocols of dr elicit different degrees of lifespan extension and stress resistance by often distinct and complementary mechanisms  <cit> . the genetic model of dr – the eat- <dig> mutant – has a decreased pumping rate, thus ingesting less bacteria, and requires the foxa transcription factor pha- <dig>  <cit>  and the dimethoxy ubiquinone hydroxylase clk- <dig>  <cit>  to extend its lifespan. distinct and overlapping factors are involved in lifespan extension by bacterial dr  and liquid dr  – two protocols of bacterial dilution in liquid cultures. bdr also depends on pha- <dig>  <cit>  and is partially dependent on the energy sensing kinase ampk subunit aak- <dig>  <cit>  and on the foxo transcription factor daf- <dig>  <cit> , while ldr depends on the nrf <dig> transcription factor homolog skn- <dig>  <cit> . the complete absence of bacteria requires the heat shock transcription factor hsf- <dig> to promote longevity  <cit> , while dilution of medium peptone increases lifespan through aak- <dig> and daf- <dig>  <cit> , and serial dilution of bacteria on semi-solid medium depends on the same factors in addition to clk- <dig>  <cit> . stress resistance induced by amino acid restriction in mice  <cit>  and lifespan extension induced by dr or by inhibition of the worm homolog of the nutrient sensing kinase mtor  in c. elegans  <cit>  also require the general control nonderepressible  <dig> kinase .

gcn <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that senses amino acid restriction through binding to uncharged trnas  <cit> . in most metazoans, gcn <dig> is one of the four known kinases that phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor  <dig>  α subunit  to inhibit translation initiation  <cit> . this leads to translation of an alternative and functional open reading frame of the atf <dig> gene   <cit> . atf <dig> is a transcription factor that targets stress response genes to confer an adaptive cellular response  <cit> . this pathway is often referred to as the integrated stress response  pathway, given that it integrates cellular response to multiple stress signals such as nutrient restriction , endoplasmic reticulum stress , viral infection  and metal deprivation   <cit> . thus, gcn2-induced isr activation in response to amino acid starvation serves as an important interface between nutritional cues and cellular resilience  <cit> .

the mechanism of activation of gcn <dig> has been well characterized in s. cerevisiae, where gcn <dig> is the only kinase that phosphorylates eif2α. for gcn <dig> to be activated in vivo it must interact with gcn <dig> through its rwd domain, when both proteins are tethered to the ribosome  <cit> . it is thought that gcn <dig> functions to transfer to gcn <dig> uncharged trnas that enter the a site of the ribosomes, thus activating it  <cit> . genetic studies in yeast revealed yih <dig>  as a potent suppressor of gcn <dig> function  <cit> . yih <dig> and its mammalian homolog impact harbor a rwd domain that competes with gcn2/gcn <dig> for the binding to gcn1/gcn <dig>  <cit> . yih <dig> or impact overexpression in yeast or mammalian cells, respectively, abrogates amino acid restriction-induced eif2α phosphorylation  <cit> . like the other members of the gcn <dig> pathway, yih1/impact is found in virtually all eukaryotes and in all cells examined . in mice, impact is especially abundant in neurons  <cit> . in these cells, down-regulation of impact inhibits in vitro neuritogenesis by enhancing the basal levels of gcn <dig> activation, suggesting an important role for impact in neuronal development  <cit> . it was less clear, however, if impact plays any role in organismal biology. our hypothesis in the present study was that impact acts to limit stress response at the whole organism level, hence counteracting the beneficial effects of dr and favoring age-related dysfunction. we used c. elegans to test this hypothesis and found that the worm homolog of impact  is an inhibitor of gcn- <dig> that suppresses eif2α phosphorylation even during fed states. impt- <dig> knockdown led to activation of the isr, improved stress resistance, reduced fertility, decreased food intake, and extended longevity in the worms. these phenotypes resembled dr in all aspects, but dr was additive to impt- <dig> rnai to extend lifespan. consistent with a dr mimetic, impt- <dig> down-regulation activated key downstream players in the dr pathway. our results highlight impt- <dig> as an important negative regulator of longevity in c. elegans, setting up the stage for a better characterization of its functions in mammalian aging and providing a new target for lifespan regulation.

RESULTS
identification and functional characterization of the c. elegans impact homolog
to identify the worm homolog of impact, we browsed the c. elegans proteome for hits with close similarity to mus musculus impact protein. this analysis led us to c. elegans y52b11a. <dig>  which shared 33 % amino acid identity and 51 % amino acid similarity  with mouse impact  and displayed the upf <dig> and rwd domains , which are conserved among impact proteins across the evolutionary spectrum. we henceforth named this protein impt- <dig> and its gene impt- <dig>  a loss-of-function mutation in the impt- <dig> gene  <cit>  rendered dead larvae when in homozygosis . we therefore studied the heterozygous worms – a balanced strain called vc <dig> or impt-1
+/– – and wildtype worms treated with impt- <dig> rnai. impt- <dig> mrna levels were reduced by 77 % in impt-1
+/– mutants and by 84 % upon impt- <dig> rnai in comparison to their respective controls .

both in yeast and mouse cells, yih1/impact acts as an inhibitor of gcn2/gcn <dig>  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that impt- <dig> inhibition could activate downstream players in the gcn-2/isr pathway in c. elegans. consistent with this hypothesis, phosphorylation of eif2α was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold higher in impt-1
+/– mutants than in wildtype n <dig> worms , but impt- <dig> rnai did not elicit the same effect . however, impt- <dig> rnai increased atf- <dig> expression by 40 % . moreover, upregulation of atf- <dig> by impt- <dig> rnai was additive to acute incubation with dithiothreitol  – a perk activator – suggesting that impt- <dig> may act in parallel with perk to regulate atf- <dig> levels . together, these results demonstrate that y52b11a. <dig> is the impact homolog of c. elegans and that this protein inhibits the isr pathway.fig.  <dig>

impt- <dig> inhibition extends lifespan and confers stress resistance
activation of gcn- <dig> is required for longevity induced by dr in c. elegans and efficient stress response induced by amino acid restriction in mice  <cit> . given the observation that impt- <dig> knockdown is sufficient to activate the isr  and that gcn- <dig> is required to control basal levels of eif2α phosphorylation  <cit> , we asked whether impt- <dig> abrogation could resemble dr effects on longevity and stress response, and whether these effects were gcn- <dig> dependent. impt-1
+/– mutants and impt- <dig> rnai-treated worms lived approximately 21 % and 16 % more than their respective controls . importantly, lifespan extension by impt- <dig> rnai was dependent on multiple components of the gcn- <dig> branch of the isr pathway, including gcn- <dig>  gcn- <dig> and atf- <dig> . whole body reduction of impt- <dig> was necessary to increase worm lifespan, since tissue-specific impt- <dig> rnai in the intestine, muscle or neurons did not change lifespan or even reduce it .fig.  <dig> components of the gcn- <dig> branch of the integrated stress response  pathway are required for impt- <dig> knockdown-induced longevity. a lifespan assays of n <dig> and impt-1

to assess the responsiveness of stress pathways in impt- <dig> knockdown models, we measured thermotolerance and oxidative stress resistance. upon chronic, mild temperature stress , impt-1
+/– mutants lived 22 % longer than wildtype worms, while impt- <dig> rnai-treated worms lived 8 % longer than their controls . furthermore, 8-hour exposure to the pro-oxidant agent sodium arsenite at 5 mm or  <dig>  mm revealed that impt-1
+/– mutants were more resistant to oxidative damage than n <dig> wildtype and gcn- <dig> mutant worms . this phenotype was also observed in n <dig> worms treated with impt- <dig> rnai, and it was completely abrogated when impt- <dig> was silenced in gcn- <dig> mutants . interestingly, gcn- <dig> mutants were more resistant to  <dig>  mm arsenite than n <dig> worms , demonstrating a baseline stress resistance phenotype as observed in gcn <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . together, these data show that impt- <dig> knockdown promotes longevity and stress resistance in a gcn- <dig> dependent manner.

other features of dr are reduced food intake, delayed development, reduced fertility, and decreased lipid storage . larval development of impt-1
+/– mutants was delayed in approximately 4 hours in comparison to n <dig> worms . the same was observed in gcn- <dig> mutants, although with a lesser magnitude . in contrast with the impt-1
+/– mutants, impt- <dig> rnai mildly accelerated development . we also scored brood size of impt-1
+/– mutants and observed an 82 ± 1 % reduction in progeny . again, this phenotype could not be mimicked by impt- <dig> rnai . furthermore, lipid accumulation in impt-1
+/– mutants was reduced by 65 ± 1 % on day  <dig> of adulthood compared to n <dig> . interestingly, this reduction was accompanied by a decrease in pharyngeal pumping observed on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of adulthood , indicating reduced feeding behavior. these parameters were not changed in gcn- <dig> mutants . although a reduction in food intake may account for the lower lipid levels of impt-1
+/– mutants, this is not sufficient to explain it since n <dig> worms treated with impt- <dig> rnai also exhibited decreased pharyngeal pumping but no differences in lipid levels on day  <dig> of adulthood . in summary, impt- <dig> knockdown resembles many features of dr such as extended longevity, increased stress resistance, and reduced food intake. delayed development, reduced brood size, and decreased fat accumulation is also observed when one allele of impt- <dig> is knocked out, but not when impt- <dig> is downregulated using rnai.fig.  <dig>

impt- <dig> limits lifespan extension conferred by dr
next, we investigated whether dr and impt- <dig> knockdown had an additive effect on longevity. when maintained in impt- <dig> rnai, eat- <dig> worms lived 25 % more than worms maintained in the control rnai . moreover, silencing of lysil-trna synthetase  using rnai – a model of amino acid restriction  <cit>  – increased the lifespan of n <dig> worms to an extent that closely resembles the longevity of impt-1
+/– mutants, while further increasing the lifespan of these mutants . moreover, longevity induced by krs- <dig> rnai was blocked in gcn- <dig> mutants . considering that dr  <cit>  and impt- <dig> knockdown need a functional gcn- <dig> pathway to produce their effects, these results suggest that impt- <dig> is a rate-limiting protein for dr-induced lifespan extension by inhibiting gcn- <dig> fig.  <dig> longevity of impt- <dig> knockdown models is additive to dietary and amino acid restriction.

components of the dr pathway are activated by impt- <dig> knockdown in an age-dependent manner
as impt- <dig> down-regulation mimics features of dr, we investigated whether downstream components of the dr pathway in c. elegans were involved in longevity induced by impt- <dig> knockdown. first, we tested if impt- <dig> rnai extended lifespan in worms carrying loss-of-function mutations in aak- <dig>  daf- <dig>  skn- <dig>  and hsf- <dig>  surprisingly, all of these genes were necessary for lifespan extension induced by impt- <dig> rnai .fig.  <dig>

given that most of these mutations  affect development, this could be the stage in which impt- <dig> and these dr genes interact to influence lifespan. furthermore, developmentally impaired mutants might indirectly mitigate the ability of impt- <dig> knockdown to prolong lifespan if this phenotype is simply a manifestation of developmental traits. we therefore tested if silencing these genes and other dr-modulated genes only during adulthood could block longevity induced by impt- <dig> knockdown. when dr genes were silenced during the adult life of impt-1
+/– mutants, we found that aak- <dig> rnai blunted impt-1
+/– extended longevity, while let- <dig> rnai did not further increase it . furthermore, impt-1
+/– mutants treated with daf- <dig> rnai during adulthood not only failed to exhibit increased lifespan, but lived 7 % less than wildtype worms exposed to the same rnai . however, loss of other dr genes  after development did not affect impt-1
+/– longevity . the fact that all of the dr-related gene mutations studied here blocked the effects of impt- <dig> rnai treatment starting at l <dig>  but only some dr-related genes affected impt-1
+/– longevity when silenced during adulthood, suggested to us that impt- <dig> might control lifespan by interacting with some genes during adult life  and others during the larval stages . consistent with this notion, when n <dig> and impt-1
+/– worms were maintained in control or skn- <dig> rnai from l <dig> to l <dig> larval stages, and then transferred to plates with control rnai for the rest of their adult life, larva-restricted skn- <dig> rnai not only blocked lifespan extension of impt-1
+/– mutants but also reduced it by 12 % in comparison to n <dig> worms on the same regimen .

we therefore investigated whether impt- <dig> rnai could affect skn- <dig> function during larval stages. we assessed the expression of a reporter construct in which a skn- <dig> target promoter directs the expression of gfp   <cit> . in our first analysis with the pgst-4::gfp reporter strain we observed no significant differences in gfp expression in response to impt- <dig> silencing, except for a trend towards an increase during l <dig>  that turned out to be significant when the n was augmented .fig.  <dig>

next, we tested if impt- <dig> knockdown affected daf- <dig> activity by measuring the expression of pdaf-16::daf-16::gfp and the daf- <dig> target construct psod-3::gfp in response to impt- <dig> rnai. the expression of psod-3::gfp during the first days of adulthood was higher in worms treated with impt- <dig> rnai when compared to control rnai, with the biggest difference being at day  <dig> . the expression of psod-3::gfp in larvae subjected to the same protocol was not different until the final larval stage , demonstrating that daf- <dig> activation by impt- <dig> knockdown starts at late larval/early adult stages . we also observed a trend towards nuclear localization of daf- <dig> in day  <dig> worms under impt- <dig> rnai . taken together, these data demonstrate that several mediators of dr and the activation of stress response transcription factors are necessary to explain longevity induced by impt- <dig> knockdown, and this occurs in an age-dependent manner.

finally, to assess if impt- <dig> expression was controlled by these dr-related transcription factors, we measured impt- <dig> mrna in daf- <dig>  skn- <dig>  and hsf- <dig> loss-of-function mutants  and in a condition where they were activated, i.e., during dr . there were no significant differences whatsoever, indicating that impt- <dig> is constitutively expressed under these conditions and is not transcriptionally regulated by these stress-associated transcription factors. nonetheless, impt- <dig> expression decreased with aging regardless of the diet  – a feature that could help activation of the isr in aged individuals.

discussion
impact is an ancient protein that exerts fundamental roles in the cellular adaptive response to nutritional stress  <cit> . impact is conserved across the metazoan phylum alongside its interacting partners gcn1and gcn <dig>  through which it negatively influences eif2α phosphorylation and limits isr activation in response to amino acid restriction and other stress conditions  <cit> . despite its important functions, no previous work had addressed the role of impact in multicellular organisms. here, we identified the impact homolog of c. elegans  and demonstrated that its partial loss-of-function is sufficient to induce the isr under the fed state. in turn, impt- <dig> knockdown extends lifespan and ameliorates stress response in gcn- <dig> and isr dependent manners. these effects also depend on several genes required for lifespan extension promoted by dr in c. elegans such as skn- <dig>  daf- <dig>  and others. these genetic interactions occur in a timely fashion, in which knocking down skn- <dig> during larval stages is sufficient to block lifespan extension exerted by impt- <dig> knockdown. impt- <dig> silencing induces skn- <dig> function in l <dig> worms, and affects daf- <dig> function later in adulthood. these results highlight the pleiotropic functions of impt- <dig> on longevity, where its knockdown during development leads to a chain of events first manifested by isr up-regulation, followed by skn- <dig> activation and later by daf- <dig> induction .fig.  <dig> working model of lifespan extension induced by impt- <dig> knockdown in c. elegans. impact acts as an inhibitor of gcn- <dig>  impt- <dig> knockdown activates the gcn- <dig> branch of the isr, increases the phosphorylation of eif2α and induces atf- <dig> expression. this pathway is further stimulated by an increase in uncharged trnas exerted by dietary restriction. in early larval stages, atf- <dig> induces skn- <dig> or acts in concert with it to activate a stress response program that leads to daf- <dig> induction in adults and confers lifespan extension. impt- <dig> also interacts with hsf- <dig> during larval stages and with aak- <dig> and let- <dig> during adulthood to control lifespan




a similar phenomenon is observed when worms are offered excess nad+ starting at late embryonic development  <cit> . these protocols prolong lifespan by a mechanism that requires activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response  first observed in day  <dig> adults and that consequentially leads to daf- <dig> translocation and sod- <dig> transcription in day  <dig> adults. lifespan extension induced by nad+ donors also requires the sirtuin sir- <dig>  and skn- <dig>  <cit> , similarly to impt- <dig> knockdown-induced longevity . interestingly, mitochondrial stress induced by inhibition of certain components of the electron transport chain  promotes eif2α phosphorylation during development, activates uprmt and prolongs lifespan in c. elegans, and this requires gcn- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, mild mitochondrial stress  <cit>  or stimulation of uprmt  <cit>  during the larval stages are sufficient to render worms long lived. we thus suggest that multiple metabolic pathways can converge into gcn- <dig> and the isr pathway during development to regulate lifespan and impt- <dig>  as an inhibitor of the gcn- <dig> pathway, limits their effects.

how exactly the activation of gcn- <dig> and the isr pathway initiates downstream events during development that culminate in lifespan extension is not absolutely clear. since expressions of the isr transcription factor atf- <dig> and the skn- <dig> target gene gst- <dig> are more prematurely up-regulated by impt- <dig> rnai and both atf- <dig> and skn- <dig> are required during larval stages for the longevity phenotype of impt- <dig> knockdown models, we propose that these two transcription factors are acting in concert to trigger a longevity pathway. indeed, in human cells, atf <dig>  has been shown to dimerize with nrf <dig>  to activate the enhancer of the heme oxygenase- <dig> gene  <cit> . in c. elegans, skn- <dig> and atf- <dig> are mutually regulated in response to endoplasmic reticulum  or oxidative stress  <cit> . importantly, atf- <dig> is a skn- <dig> target gene and atf- <dig> ablation prevents er stress from inducing transcription of skn- <dig> and its target genes  <cit> . thus, these studies and our observations provide evidence to suggest that skn- <dig> function is controlled by the isr. however, nrf <dig> is also a direct substrate of the er stress-regulated eif2α kinase perk, and it has been proposed to mediate perk-dependent cell survival independently of eif2α phosphorylation in mouse cells  <cit> . whether skn- <dig> and atf- <dig> act together or in parallel to control lifespan of c. elegans is a matter for future studies.

the importance of impt- <dig> and gcn- <dig> during larval stages is further supported by delayed development in the impt- <dig> heterozygous mutants and mid-larval arrest in impt- <dig> homozygous mutants and in n <dig> worms treated with krs- <dig> rnai from eggs . given that both krs- <dig> and impt- <dig> ablations activate isr when initiated in early development , these interventions could represent a stress signal that inhibits progression through the larval stages . however, gcn- <dig> depletion by rnai does not reverse the larval arrest phenotype of impt- <dig> homozygous mutants , indicating independence of gcn- <dig>  similarly, the knockdown of impact in mouse neuronal cell lines partially affects neuritogenesis in a gcn2-independent manner  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that yih <dig> controls yeast cell cycle independently of gcn <dig> or gcn <dig>  <cit> . these phenotypes are in sharp contrast with the effects of impt- <dig> knockdown on longevity and stress resistance, which require both gcn- <dig> and gcn- <dig>  evidencing the broad, yet poorly understood roles of impact.


impt- <dig> knockdown by rnai or by its heterozygous null mutation render worms with very similar phenotypes but also with some fundamentally different ones. both interventions decrease impt- <dig>  reduce pharyngeal pumping, increase lifespan, and promote stress resistance at similar levels. on the other hand, while impt-1
+/–reduces brood size, delays development and decreases triglyceride content, impt- <dig> rnai does not affect these parameters, or in the case of developmental timing even accelerates it. impt- <dig> rnai also does not promote eif2α phosphorylation as impt-1
+/– does, at least not in the time point that we analyzed, but it increases atf- <dig> expression, which is directly downstream of eif2α. these distinctions may be explained by different hypotheses, including maternally inherited traits, rnai delivery constraints or timing. more importantly, they highlight the fact that these phenotypes are not completely associated, and that impt- <dig> knockdown can increase lifespan without continuous hyperphosphorylation of eif2α or affecting fertility, development, and fat accumulation.

in a broad spectrum, the phenotypes of impt- <dig> knockdown models can resemble the characteristics of dietary restricted animals, i.e., increased lifespan, improved stress response, delayed development, reduced fertility, decreased fat accumulation, and diminished food intake. additionally, the levels of impt- <dig> and uncharged trnas seem to limit each other’s effects. for example, when impt- <dig> is decreased  but uncharged trnas levels are low , lifespan extension is limited, as observed when uncharged trna levels increase  in the presence of high levels of impt- <dig> . however, when dr and impt- <dig> knockdown are combined, lifespan is extended to its maximum under these circumstances. this could be interpreted through the perspective that dr and impt- <dig> knockdown act in parallel pathways. however, the genetic interaction of impt- <dig> with essentially all downstream components of the dr pathway suggests otherwise, that dr and impt- <dig> indeed share the same route to control lifespan. one alternative explanation is that impt- <dig> knockdown releases more gcn- <dig> to interact with gcn- <dig> and respond more efficiently to uncharged trnas that are more abundant during dr. therefore, loss of impt- <dig> would have an effect under the fed state, and this effect would be exacerbated under dr. considering that impt- <dig> knockdown , eat- <dig>  <cit>  and krs- <dig> rnai  all increase lifespan in gcn- <dig> or gcn- <dig> dependent manners, we suggest that these interventions converge into activating gcn- <dig> to exert their effects.

however, how can impt- <dig> knockdown increase gcn- <dig> activation under the fed state? a similar effect was observed in mouse neuronal cells, which express high levels of impact. the knockdown of impact in these cells resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated gcn <dig>  the active form of the kinase, and of phosphorylated eif2α  <cit> . it is possible that the resulting increase in gcn- <dig> available for interacting with gcn- <dig> will render gcn- <dig> more sensitive to the basal levels of uncharged trnas that occur naturally in the cells, as a result of each cycle of translation elongation as they exit the ribosomes.

and why would dr and krs- <dig> rnai increase lifespan when applied to adult worms while impt- <dig> knockdown requires activation of skn- <dig> during development? one possible explanation is a model where stoichiometric balance determines the effects. in such a model, uncharged trna levels are sufficiently high during development  and impt- <dig> becomes rate limiting, exerting an important inhibitory pressure on gcn- <dig>  on the other hand, uncharged trnas are less abundant in adults and therefore impt- <dig> is dispensable for gcn- <dig> regulation in the absence of a proper stimulus. this model is supported by the important functions of impt- <dig> during development and by the fact that krs- <dig> rnai during adulthood adds to impt-1
+/– to prolong lifespan. curiously, while krs- <dig> rnai applied to adult n <dig> worms increases lifespan in our hands, another study reported decreased lifespan of n <dig> worms under the same rnai clone  <cit> . these discrepancies might be related to slightly different protocols that could sensitize or desensitize the gcn- <dig> pathway. one such difference in our study is the use of fudr, which inhibits progeny.

reduced food intake is usually the primary cause of dr. the fact that impt- <dig> knockdown causes the pharyngeal pumping rate to be decreased indicates that this phenotype may also explain or at least partially contribute to longevity. interestingly, brain-specific activation of gcn <dig> and phosphorylation of eif2α leads to an aversive behavior against amino acid deficient diets . hyperactivation of the gcn <dig> pathway may therefore represent an evolutionarily conserved hub to control food intake and metabolic adaptation in response to changes in nutrient availability.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, reduction of impt- <dig> in worms is sufficient to trigger the isr pathway and confer phenotypic characteristics that resemble dr, including extended longevity. further studies are required to confirm the importance of impt- <dig> in vertebrates, but its highly conserved function and the broad evolutionary spectrum where the impact/gcn <dig> pathway actuates gives us hints that our findings might be applied to more complex organisms. if so, impact may serve as an important drug target to mimic dr in humans, in a way that could dissociate its beneficial effects from its heavy demands.
