BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal microbiota of animals play an important role in the maintenance of health and modulation of disease. previously, ecosystems have been characterized using microbiological methods based on culturing and phenotypic analysis of the isolates. since the growth requirements of many bacteria are unknown, most of the gastrointestinal bacteria remain uncultivated. molecular studies, avoiding the cultivation bias, yield more detailed insight into the diversity and characteristics of the intestinal ecosystems. most cultivation independent studies have been conducted on the human gastrointestinal tract, but also animals including pigs, rats, chicken, termites, zebras, and ruminants such as reindeer, sheep, cows, and gazelles have been investigated  <cit> . as is the case with the intestinal ecosystems of many of the carnivore animals, the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract of the polar bear is unknown and we know little about the microbial diversity and dominant species in these animals. the barents sea subpopulation of polar bears is located in an area which is sparsely populated by humans and thereby has little contact with human activities  <cit> . this enables us to study an ecosystem with little human impact.

antibiotic resistant bacteria are known to originate in populations located in environments that seem not to have been exposed to the selective pressure of pharmaceutically produced antibiotics  <cit> . the β-lactam antibiotics are of the most widely used agents in clinical and veterinary practice, and resistance to these agents are commonly observed in clinical settings  <cit> . some of the most common resistance genes are bla genes which encode β-lactamases that give high level resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, and within this group, the blatem genes are very important  <cit> . the blatem alleles encode resistance to ampicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. even though widespread in clinical settings, only few studies have determined the distribution of blatem genes in non-clinical environments, included the gastrointestinal tract of free ranging arctic wild mammals  <cit> . in this study, we have examined the role of polar bear gut microbiota as a potential natural reservoir of the clinically important blatem genes.

polar bears are major predators in the arctic marine ecosystem. they are closely associated with sea ice, which they use as substrate for both hunting and movement  <cit> . the world population of polar bears is currently believed to be about  <dig> - <dig>  animals that can be divided into  <dig> subpopulations throughout the circumpolar arctic  <cit> . the barents sea subpopulation is one of these, and inhabits the geographic regions of svalbard, the barents sea and franz josef land. the size of this subpopulation is estimated to be approximately  <dig> individuals  <cit> . the polar bear has a monogastric digestive system with a simple and relatively short intestine typical of a carnivorous animal, and with the caecum completely lacking  <cit> . polar bears are mostly carnivorous and feed mainly on seals, although white whales, narwhals, birds, bird eggs and carrion can be important food items during times of the year when seals are less available  <cit> . in svalbard, polar bear predation on reindeer on land has also been observed  <cit> .

to improve our understanding of the intestinal ecosystem of the polar bear we have studied the bacterial diversity and the prevalence of blatem alleles in faeces of polar bears in svalbard, norway . we here present the results of the molecular characterization of the gastrointestinal microbiota of polar bears sampled through 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing.

RESULTS
bacterial diversity
sequences were obtained from  <dig> clones and none of the sequences were identified as possible chimeras. all sequences were affiliated with the phylum firmicutes, with 99% of the sequences belonging to the order clostridiales . the majority of the sequences  were affiliated to the genus clostridium. based on 97% sequence similarity, seventeen phylotypes were identified  within the clone library, with the chao <dig> index estimating the population richness to be twenty phylotypes. the shannon-weaver index, a measure of diversity, was  <dig> , and the coverage was 97%. the most abundant phylotype contained 42% of the sequences, and the nearest relative  was clostridium perfringens. four phylotypes  were novel, showing < 97% similarity to sequences representing the phylotypes nearest cultivated relative. phylotype pbm_a <dig> contained five sequences and the nearest cultivated relative  was clostridium bartlettii. the nearest cultivated relative  to phylotype pbf_b <dig> which contained two sequences was ruminococcus hansenii. the other two phylotypes  contained only one sequence each and the nearest relative belonged to the phylum firmicutes  and to unclassified bacteria , respectively.

aerobic heterotrophic cell counts and β-lactamase activity
the aerobic heterotrophic cell counts ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml for the rectum swabs, and from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g for the faeces samples . the coliform counts for the faeces samples ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g. there was no growth of ampicillin resistant bacteria in the faeces samples. for the rectal swabs, the proportion of ampr bacteria ranged between 3% and 44% . a total of  <dig> randomly selected ampr isolates cultivated from rectal swab samples were tested for β-lactamase activity by the nitrocefin test and all isolates showed β-lactamase activity.

avalues are based on nine replicates. bin the case of polar bear no.  <dig> only  <dig>  gram of faeces sample was taken for subsequent dilution and plating. for all the other animals this amount was  <dig> gram.

detection of blatem genes in ampr isolates
the absence of pcr inhibitory substances in the dna extracted from ampr isolates was tested by running 16s rrna gene pcr on extracted dna from each of  <dig> single isolates. as much as  <dig> of the amplifications were positive, indicating that bacterial dna is amplifiable in 98% of the samples. subsequently,  <dig> ampr isolates from the rectal samples were screened for the presence of blatem genes with primers designed for the tem- <dig> allele and derivatives  <cit> , and  <dig> of the ampr isolates were positive. for all four positive isolates, sequencing of the flanking regions demonstrated the presence of blatem inserted in a tn <dig> backbone. the four isolates were identified as e. coli by id <dig> e  and 16s rrna gene sequencing.

detection of blatem genes in total genomic dna extracts
total genomic dna was extracted from the rectal swab from polar bear no.  <dig> . the sample was negative for blatem pcr and positive when screened for 16s rrna genes, confirming the general suitability of dna for pcr. total genomic dna was also extracted from faeces from three of the polar bears  sampled in  <dig>  and one of the three faecal samples was negative, while one was positive, and one out of five dna extractions from the third sample  was positive .

athe animals' conditions are subjectively given values from  <dig> to  <dig> to indicate the amount of fat on their bodies, with increasing values indicating more fat; bsamples from polar bears no.  <dig> and  <dig> were excluded from further analysis due to low number of cfu/g. nd, not determined.

discussion
the barents sea subpopulation of polar bears has little contact with human activities  <cit> , and the samples investigated in this study were collected from the subpopulation in their natural environment in svalbard, norway. fresh faeces were collected from live, sedated bears and immediately frozen. there is a potential loss of bacteria when samples are stored before cultivation of bacteria. the pure faeces samples were stored at -70°c and the rectum swabs were stored in 20% glycerol at the same temperature. achá et al  <cit>  found that there was not a great loss of bacterial number and species when pure faeces samples were stored at -70°c compared to faeces samples mixed with a cryoprotectant such as glycerol, as long as the samples were not repeatedly thawed and analysed in shorter intervals. the samples processed in this study were not repeatedly thawed and analysed and we expect little loss of bacterial number and species compared to if the samples were mixed with glycerol before storing.

the 16s rrna gene libraries were made from dna extracted from faeces, and the samples were pooled after pcr to ensure that bacterial dna from all animals was equally represented. the number of pcr cycles were reduced to a minimum, as the frequency of formation of chimeric molecules increases by the number of pcr cycles  <cit> . we used  <dig> cycles for the amplification of the 16s rrna genes, and did not detect possible chimeras using the chimera detection program. seventeen different phylotypes were identified among the  <dig> sequences analysed . the coverage of the combined libraries was 97%, which indicate that we have detected the majority of the present microbioma in the faeces. in a study based on faecal microbial communities of  <dig> individual mammals representing  <dig> species from  <dig> taxonomic orders, including captive bears and pandas, ley et al  <cit>  observed that host diet and phylogeny both influence bacterial diversity, which increases from carnivorous to omnivorous to herbivorous animals. in captive carnivores between  <dig> and  <dig> otus were observed using the 96% similarity criteria, while in herbivore animals up to  <dig> otus were detected. within members of the ursidae family including carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous bears, the number of otus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> which is consistent with our findings.

only four of the seventeen phylotypes were < 97% related to any known cultivated species . this is in contrast to observations made in other studies that the microbial diversity reflected by cultivation represents only a minor fraction of the microbial diversity. in a study of the microbial diversity in reindeer,  <dig> % of the bacterial diversity represented novel taxonomic groupings  <cit> . a study on the microbial community composition of the intestinal tract of chickens, 85% of the phylotypes did not have sequence similarity to any cultured species  <cit> , and in the pig gastrointestinal microbiota, 83% of the identified phylotypes were not likely represented by a known bacterial species  <cit> . analysis of the polar bear faeces in this study showed a homogenous microbial flora dominated by clostridia class. these bacteria are well characterized as they are dominant in the human gut and thereby in the interest of many scientists  <cit> .

all  <dig> sequences obtained from polar bears were affiliated with the phylum firmicutes . all except one sequence affiliated with the order clostridiales, and 93% to the family clostridiaceae. the low level of diversity observed in the polar bear clone library is in contrast to the diversity observed in colon content from another arctic carnivorous animal belonging to the same order as polar bears, the hooded seal   <cit> . sequences that affiliated with the phyla bacteroides, firmicutes, fusobacteria, and proteobacteria were identified in the colon content from the seals. the dominant phylum was the bacteroides to which 68% of the sequences were affiliated, while 21% were affiliated to the firmicutes  <cit> . the same molecular methods were used to analyse both the polar bear and seal samples, indicating that the methods are not selective towards firmicutes. jores et al  <cit>  found clostridium in 44% of the samples when cultivating faeces from polar bears in svalbard. in faeces from a herbivorous mammal, the wild gorilla, 71% of the phylogenetic lineage was firmicutes  <cit> . ley et al  <cit>  observed that the microbial faecal bacterial communities from bears on different diets cluster together, independent of the diet. however, these observations were made in animals kept in zoo's and might not reflect the situation in the wild. eight of the  <dig> sequences  from polar bear faeces collected in zoo's  <cit>  were compared to the sequences obtained in this study . the eight zoo polar bear sequences included in fig.  <dig> represent eight out of  <dig> phylotypes  and contain 59% of the  <dig> zoo polar bear sequences. only two of the sequences, representing 10% of all the sequences, cluster together with sequences from our study, indicating a difference between the microbioma in faeces of wild and captive polar bears.

we investigated the prevalence of blatem alleles in faeces from polar bears with little human impact in svalbard, norway. we have earlier investigated the prevalence of blatem alleles in arctic soils and sediments, and in colon content of arctic seals and found low prevalence of the alleles  <cit> . this current cultivation study of faeces from polar bears did not give any growth on plates with ampicillin . the blatem alleles are likely to be found in coliform bacteria, but the selective growth on macconkey agar with ampicillin yielded <  <dig> % ampr cfu . however, from 3% to 44% of the isolates from the rectal swabs were phenotypically ampr. a random selection of ampr isolates all showed β-lactamase activity, but when tested by blatem pcr, only  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates were positive. this indicates a low level of blatem alleles. the four isolates were all identified as e. coli, and the blatem alleles were inserted in a tn <dig> transposon which is found in a wide variety of bacteria. the presence of blatem alleles has previously been reported in wild animals in portugal, where they detected the alleles in e. coli isolated from faeces from deer, fox, owl, and birds of prey  <cit> . others have identified blatem in faecal e. coli isolates from pigs, dogs, and cats  <cit> . the blatem pcr on total dna extracted was negative for the two rectal swabs, and two of the three faecal samples were blatem pcr positive . previous studies on arctic soil samples suggest that the detection limit for total dna extracted was <  <dig> blatem alleles  per pcr sample  <cit> . the diversity analysis of polar bear faeces showed a dominance of clostridiales in which there has been no reports of β-lactamase production. this is consistent with the low levels of blatem alleles detected in the samples.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that the bacterial diversity in faeces from polar bears in their natural environment in the pristine svalbard area were low, all obtained clones affiliated to firmicutes. as with any pcr-based method, 16s rrna gene clone libraries are biased  <cit>  and the gastrointestinal microbiota of more polar bears should be studied to give a more complete picture of the microbial diversity. furthermore, only low levels of blatem alleles were detected in contrast to their increasing prevalence in some clinical and commensal bacterial populations.
