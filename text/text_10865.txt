BACKGROUND
mitochondria, organelles essential for energy transduction, are present in almost all eukaryotes and have their own genome. like nuclear genomes, mitochondrial  genomes vary considerably in size, structure, and gene content
 <cit> . there are two major mt genome forms: circular and linear. circular forms are present in animal mt genomes with sizes ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb and gene arrangements in the genomes are remarkably stable
 <cit> . some animal circular mt genomes are composed of more than two chromosomes or minicircles . circular forms are also found in higher-plant mt genomes. a higher-plant mt genome is characterized by a multipartite structure, which contains several subgenomic circular molecules with various organizational features, with sizes ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb
 <cit> .

linear mt genomes are found in diverse, unrelated organisms and have terminal inverted repeat  on both ends
 <cit> . in some organisms, the mt genomes are divided into multiple chromosomes , or several hundred chromosomes . in the phylum apicomplexa, which includes important pathogens such as the causative agents of malaria , coccidiosis , and piroplasmosis , the mt genome structure is also diverse. monomeric linear mt genomes with tir on both ends are found in the babesia and theileria genera
 <cit> . the babesia/theileria mt genomes are from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb in size and encode only three protein coding genes  in addition to  <dig> fragmented small subunit  and large subunit  ribosomal rna  sequences
 <cit> . plasmodium, closely related to babesia/theileria <cit> , has the minuscule 6-kb tandemly repeated linear or concatenated mt genome, which encodes the same three protein coding genes as babesia/theileria <cit> . the gene arrangements and transcriptional direction are however different from babesia/theileria. furthermore, ssu and lsu rrna genes of plasmodium are highly fragmented with  <dig> pieces
 <cit>  and the pattern of fragmentation differs from babesia/theileria <cit> . eimeria, which is distantly related to babesia/theileria and plasmodium, possess a concatemeric form and contains the same three protein-coding genes and  <dig> rrna gene fragments as plasmodium <cit> . a recent phylogenetic study suggests that a concatenated form appears to be the ancestral mt genome structure in the phylum apicomplexa, with the monomeric linear form of babesia/theileria having evolved in the lineage
 <cit> . we are interested in the evolution of linear mt genomes of babesia/theileria, and investigated mt genome structure of the rodent piroplasms, babesia microti and babesia rodhaini, which belong to archaeopiroplasmids group, a lineage which branched off earlier from babesia/theileria <cit> . results revealed that both b. microti and b. rodhaini have a monomeric linear mt genome, in which two pairs of unique ir sequences are present, and that flip-flop inversions in each pair of the irs appear to generate four distinct mt genome structures.

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome organization
we obtained the complete mt genome sequences of b. microti  and b. rodhaini . the b. microti mt genome was a monomeric linear molecule of  <dig>  kb  and contained three protein-coding genes, cox <dig>  cob and cox <dig>  and seven ssu and  <dig> lsu rrna gene fragments . unexpectedly, the b. microti mt genome possessed two pairs of long inverted repeats, inverted repeats a  and b . the nucleotide sequences of ir-a  and ir-b  were dissimilar to each other. a  <dig> -kb region between two ir-as contained cox <dig>  rna <dig>  rna <dig>  rna <dig>  rna <dig>  lsu <dig>  lsu <dig>  cob, lsu <dig> and lsu <dig>  and a  <dig> -kb region between two ir-bs contained rna <dig>  cox <dig>  rna <dig>  ssue, ssuf, lsu <dig>  lsu <dig>  ssua, lsub, ssud, ssub, lsua and rna <dig>  the predicted secondary structures for fragments comprising the b. microti ssu and lsu rrna, except for the lsu1-lsu <dig> whose secondary structures have been predicted in theileria parva and babesia gibsoni <cit> , are shown in additional file
1: figure s1-a. rna <dig> is a transcript of unknown function in plasmodium falciparum and t. parva <cit> . an intervening region  between ir-a and ir-b does not appear to contain any gene or gene fragment. searches for other repeat sequences identified additional three short repeats with lengths of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp in the b. microti mt genome .

interestingly, the b. microti mt genome displayed four distinct genome structures, types i, ii, iii and iv . the four genome structures can be generated by two inversions: one is an inversion of a region containing the  <dig> -kb region between the ir-as  and the other an inversion of a region containing the  <dig> -kb region between the ir-bs . southern blot hybridization with probe cox <dig>  against undigested b. microti genomic dna produced a clear signal at  <dig>  kb . hybridization against dna digested with drai gave two bands at  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb . hybridization against eco065i-digested dna yielded two bands at  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb . these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the four genome structures, types i, ii, iii and iv are generated by dual ‘flip-flop’ inversions of region a and region b. thus, drai digestion produced 10-kb and  <dig> -kb fragments , and additionally produced  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb fragments : and eco065i digestion produced  <dig> -kb,  <dig> -kb  and  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb fragments . hybridization with a cox <dig> probe  revealed a clear signal at  <dig>  kb against undigested genomic dna , two bands at  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb against dna digested with drai , and two bands at  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb against dna with eco065i . another b. microti probe from an intervening region  gave a band at  <dig>  kb against undigested genomic dna , two bands at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb against drai-treated dna , and two bands at  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb against eco065i-digested dna . these results obtained with bm- <dig> and bm- <dig> are consistent with the idea of dual ‘flip-flop’ inversions.

the b. rodhaini mt genome  also possessed two pairs of long inverted repeats, ir-a  and ir-b  and four distinct genome structures  . ir-a contained lsu <dig>  a  <dig> -kb region between two ir-as  contained cox <dig>  rna <dig>  rna <dig>  rna <dig>  rna <dig>  lsu <dig>  lsu <dig>  cob and lsu <dig>  a  <dig> -kb region between two ir-bs  contained rna <dig>  cox <dig>  rna <dig>  ssue, ssuf, lsu <dig>  lsu <dig>  ssua, lsub, ssud, ssub, lsua and rna <dig>  the transcriptional direction of ssue and lsu <dig> of the b. rodhaini mt genome is different from that of the b. microti mt genome. the predicted secondary structures for fragments comprising the b. rodhaini ssu and lsu rrna, except for the lsu1-lsu <dig>  are shown in additional file 1: figure s1-b. rna <dig> seems to be functionally important since its nucleotide sequence is highly conserved among b. microti, b. rodhaini, t. parva and p. falciparum . an intervening region  between ir-a and ir-b does not appear to contain any gene and gene fragment. in addition to the two irs, a pair of short direct repeat was identified .

as in the b. microti mt genome, the four genome structures of b. rodhaini can also be generated by dual flip-flop inversions of region a and region b. thus, hybridization with br- <dig> against undigested dna produced a clear signal at  <dig>  kb , as expected from the genome sequence. hybridization against hindiii-digested dna gave two bands at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb , the former being expected in types iii and iv , and the latter expected in types i and ii . hybridization against xhoi-digested dna yielded two bands at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, , the former being expected in types i and iii, and the latter expected in types ii and iv. hybridization with br- <dig> yielded a band at  <dig>  kb against undigested dna , two bands at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb against hindiii-digested dna , and two bands at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb against xhoi-digested dna . the intervening region probe  gave a band at  <dig>  kb against undigested dna , two bands at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb against hindiii-digested dna , and two bands at  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb against xhoi-digested dna . these signals were consistent with the four genome structures .

all monomeric linear mt genomes characterized to date have a single pair of tir on both ends
 <cit> . thus, to our knowledge this is the first study to show two pairs of distinct ir sequences. in both b. microti and b. rodhaini, dual flip-flop inversions of region a and region b appear to generate four mt genome structures. we postulate that the dual flip-flop inversions are mediated through recombination in palindromes of ir-a and ir-b . recombination between a pair of ir-as  produces an isomeric form characterized by a flip-flop of region a , thus generating four distinct mt genome structures.

flip-flop inversion of nuclear or organelle genomes have been found in some organisms. in the bacterium staphylococcus aureus, large-scale inversion of its chromosome switches on or off different phenotypes, including the expression of dozens of genes
 <cit> . the mt activity of the plasmodium genus, which is closely related to the babesia and theileria genera, has been reported to be different between mosquito stages and vertebrate stages
 <cit> . therefore, it is likely that flip-flop inversions of the b. microti and b. rodhaini mt genomes may switch on or off expression of mt genes and gene fragments in their lifecycles.

transcription
rt-pcr using three separate primer sets targeting about 500-bp sequences of cox <dig>  cox <dig> and cob of b. microti gave the expected transcript size using cdna but not rna . similarly, expected pcr sized fragments were obtained using primers specific to b. rodhaini for cox <dig>  cox <dig> and cob . results confirm the transcription of the three protein-coding genes. we were unable to perform additional transcription analysis, such as a northern blotting, for  <dig> ssu and lsu gene fragments, due to extreme difficulties in obtaining an adequate amount of parasites from infected mice. two reports of kairo et al.
 <cit>  on the transcription of five lsu rrna gene fragments  in t. parva and hikosaka et al.
 <cit>  on the transcription of lsu <dig> in b. gibsoni, however, suggest that at least these six fragments are transcribed in b. microti and b. rodhaini.

estimations of the molar ratio of the four mt genome structures and mt genome copy number
we estimated the molar ratio of the four genome structures of b. microti. the intensity ratios of the two signals produced by hybridization of the bm- <dig> probe with drai-digested dna  and eco065i-digested dna  were  <dig>  and  <dig>  , respectively. likewise, hybridization of the bm- <dig> probe with drai-digested dna , and the bm- <dig> probe with drai-digested dna  produced same signal intensities of  <dig>  each. these suggest that a molar ratio of types-i, ii, iii and iv of the b. microti mt genome is approximately 1:1:1: <dig>  we infer that the four distinct genome structures is generated from one parasite because the four genome structures was confirmed by southern blot analysis for genomic dna extracted from parasites derived from a single parasite cloned by limiting dilutions . in addition, copy number analysis using southern hybridization estimated about  <dig> copies of the mt genome per haploid nuclear genome. taken together, these findings suggest that one parasite possesses four types of mt genome structure in b. microti.

in b. rodhaini, the molar ratio of the four mt genome structures  was also approximately 1:1:1: <dig>  thus, intensity ratio of the two signals produced in each case by hybridization of the br- <dig> probe with dna digested by hindiii or xhoi , and of the br- <dig> probe , and of the br- <dig> probe  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the equivalent molar ratio was confirmed by southern blot analysis using dna of b. rodhaini cloned by limiting dilutions . copy number of the b. rodhiani mt genome was estimated to be two to three copies per haploid nuclear genome. this suggests that one parasite has one to three types of mt genome structures, and four distinct mt genome structures may be generated during cell proliferation.

phylogeny
both b. microti and b. rodhaini belong to an ancestral group of babesia/theileria, represented by the archaeopiroplasmid group, according to phylogenetic analysis using 18s rrna gene sequence
 <cit> . the maximum likelihood  tree inferred from concatenated cox <dig> and cob amino acid sequences  revealed a monophyletic relationship between babesids, theilerids and archaeopiroplasmids with a bootstrap proportion  value of 100%, clearly separated from a clade of plasmodium species. b. microti and b. rodhaini were grouped into a clade , which was located at the branch leading to the common ancestor of babesids and theilerids. these results indicate that the monomeric linear mt genomes found in the group of babesids, theilerids and archaeopiroplasmids were generated specifically in this lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
we found a novel linear monomeric mt genome structure in the rodent piroplasms, babesia microti and babesia rodhaini, equipped with dual flip-flop inversion system, by which four distinct genome structures are readily generated. such a unique linear mt genome structure has not been known in not only apicomplexan parasites but also in other organisms. the present findings would provide insight into further understanding of evolution of mt genome structure.
