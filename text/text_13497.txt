BACKGROUND
histone acetylation, as a major and important post-translational modification of core histones, was started to be investigated early in  <dig>  <cit> . histone acetylation modifies chromatin structure, affecting gene transcription and thus regulating multiple cellular processes. histone acetylation and deacetylation were regulated by histone acetyltransferases  and histone deacetylases , respectively. hats add acetyl groups to lysines on core histones, while hdacs remove the acetyls from histones. histone acetylation catalyzed by hats leads to the expanded structure of chromatin, while hypoacetylation of histones mediated by hdacs is generally associated with the condensed structure of chromatin and repression/silencing of genes  <cit> . hdacs are widely distributed in eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi. to date, hdacs in human and animals have been more widely and deeply investigated than plants. in  <dig>  hdac enzyme activity was first detected in pea  <cit> . however, only in recent years, hdacs in plants have attracted more attention and certain hdac genes in arabidopsis and crops have been deeply studied  <cit> . the available data from these plants showed that hdacs played a key role in plant growth, development and stress responses  <cit> . based on sequence homology to yeast hdacs, hdacs in plants were divided into three major groups, namely reduced potassium dependency 3/histone deacetylase  <dig> , histone deacetylase  <dig>  and silent information regulator  <dig> . the enzyme activity of rpd3/hda1- and hd2-type histone deacetylases could be inhibited by hdac specific inhibitors trichostatin a  and butyrate   <cit> . the genome of black cottonwood  was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit>  and eleven hdac genes were identified in the populus genus. however, functions of these hdacs are remaining to be characterized.

in plants, root system development such as root hair development, lateral root formation and primary root growth were epigenetically regulated by hdacs. early in  <dig>  murphy et al. found that tsa and helminthosporium carbonum  toxin were able to halt mitosis in cultured root meristems of pisum sativum  <cit> . recently, hdacs have been reported to be involved in root hair development. for example, in arabidopsis, tsa treatment altered the cellular pattern of root epidermis and induced hair cell development at non-hair positions  <cit> . moreover, hda <dig> was further identified to be a key regulator of root development. ethylene insensitive  <dig>  and its closest homolog ein3-like <dig>  are two transcription factors that integrate ethylene signaling and jasmonic acid  signaling in root development. arabidopsis rpd3-type histone deacetylase hda <dig> was able to repress ein3/eil1-dependent transcription and inhibit ja signaling  <cit> . when the arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to tsa, root hair formation was drastically induced. hdacs also play an important role in lateral root  development. lr formation is a progress regulated by auxin and auxin response factors , such as arf <dig> and arf <dig>  in arabidopsis, arf7/arf <dig> double mutants had few lrs  <cit> . iaa <dig> is an indole-3-acetic acid  regulatory protein and functions as a repressor of arf proteins in arabidopsis. its gain-of-function mutation in domain ii, slr- <dig>  improved its stability and resulted in constitutive inactivation of arf functions  <cit> . as a result, auxin-induced pericycle cell divisions for lr initiation were blocked. however, the lr formation in slr- <dig> mutant plants was promoted by tsa treatment  <cit> . thus hdacs appeared to be required for the lr phenotype in slr- <dig> mutants and play a negative role in the activation of arf7/ <dig> functions in lr initiation. in addition, hdacs acted as an important regulator in primary root growth. the distribution of auxin in primary root tips was mediated by auxin transporters such as pin-formed  family and atp-binding cassette  superfamily  <cit> . in the work of nguyen et al., the primary root elongation was significantly inhibited by hdac inhibitors tsa and nab  <cit> . in response to hdac inhibitors, the accumulation of arabidopsis pin <dig> protein in root tips was abolished through the 26s proteasome-mediated degradation  <cit> . in rice, overexpression of oshdac <dig> gene in transgenic seedlings enhanced root growth  <cit>  and a nam-ataf-cuc  transcription factor osnac <dig>  which mediates the alteration of root development, was identified to be the target of oshdac <dig>  <cit> . these findings indicated that hdacs act as key regulators in root system development.

the black cottonwood  is of considerable commercial and ecological importance and accepted as a model system for biological study of trees  <cit> . in the populus genus, an increasing number of genes involved in development and stress responses have been identified at genome level. for example, genes encoding heat shock proteins  and heat shock factors  in response to drought stress have recently been identified and comprehensively characterized . meanwhile, using high-throughput rna-seq method, long intergenic non-coding rnas   <cit> , drought responsive micrornas  <cit>  and alternative splicing of xylem-expressed genes  <cit>  were genome-widely identified. thus the high-throughput rna sequence analysis is an effective method to identify genes involved in development and stress responses in the populus.

for woody plants, de novo organogenesis under tissue culture conditions is an effective method to reproduce seedlings. however, for many woody plants, shoot or root regeneration was still difficult, even after trying many methods such as changing hormones, medium components, or culture conditions. to date, the role of epigenetic regulation on organogenesis was less known. investigation of hdac functions in root organogenesis and development and identification of genes regulated by hdacs at genome-wide level will provide valuable information for understanding root development mechanism. in this study, histone deacetylase specific inhibitor tsa was used to investigate the role of hdacs in populus root regeneration and development. our results showed that tsa treatment decreased hdac activity in roots, delayed root regeneration and inhibited primary root growth. a digital gene expression  analysis was performed to examine the differentially expressed genes in roots when subjected to different concentrations of tsa. our findings suggested that root organogenesis and development were epigenetically regulated in populus trichocarpa.

RESULTS
tsa modified root regeneration and root system development
the populus shoots were transferred onto the rooting medium  supplemented with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  μm tsa to examine the role of tsa on root regeneration, growth and development. at each concentration, at least  <dig> shoots were cultured on the medium for root regeneration and the regenerated roots showed the same morphological traits. after shoots being transferred onto the rooting medium without tsa supplemented for  <dig> d, roots were regenerated from the bottom of shoots and reached around 1 cm in length, while in presence of tsa, the regeneration of roots was delayed. on the medium containing 1 μm tsa, the length of the regenerated roots was about  <dig>  cm, while no root was regenerated on the medium containing  <dig>  μm tsa . the growth of the regenerated roots was inhibited by tsa after shoots being transferred onto the rooting medium for 2 weeks . hdac activities in the regenerated roots were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold decreased after 1 μm and  <dig>  μm tsa treatment, respectively . the length  and number  of the regenerated roots were significantly reduced by tsa in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, the regenerated roots growing on the medium containing  <dig>  μm tsa were much thicker than control roots. to know the reason why the roots were so thick, analysis of semithin sections was performed. the morphological analysis showed that the number of cells in cortex was increased, while the size of the cells appeared not to be significantly altered . these findings suggested that hdacs were required for root organogenesis, growth and development in populus.fig.  <dig> inhibition of root regeneration by tsa. roots were regenerated from the bottom of shoots which were cultured on medium supplemented with 0 μm , 1 μm  and  <dig>  μm  tsa in populus trichocarpa

digital gene expression  libraries and tag mapping
in order to know the possible mechanism by which root growth and development were regulated by tsa, a dges analysis was performed. the dge libraries from the roots grown on the wpm medium supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  μm tsa were named libraries t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> , respectively . a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> raw tags were sequenced in t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries, respectively. after filtering out the adaptors, low quality tags containing unknown nucleotides “n” and tags with copy number <  <dig>  the remaining “clean” tags for the three libraries were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the distinct tags for the three libraries corresponding to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  μm tsa treatment were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  from which the distinct clean tags were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the distribution of the total and distinct clean tag copy numbers showed highly similar tendencies in the three libraries . the percentage of distinct clean tags declined with the increase of tag copy number . for each library, approximately 71 % of the transcripts were expressed at low levels , less than 24 % of the distinct clean tags had copy numbers between  <dig> and  <dig>  while only ~5 % were expressed at high levels . therefore, most of the genes in roots were expressed at low levels and only a small number of the genes were expressed at high levels.table  <dig> statistics of categorization and abundance of dge tags

to reveal the molecular events behind dge profiles, clean tags of the three dge libraries were mapped to the populus trichocarpa genome, allowing only a 1-bp mismatch . for t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  dge libraries,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the distinct clean tags were mapped to the populus genome database,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the distinct clean tags were mapped unambiguously to the unigene database, and  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the distinct clean tags did not map to the unigene virtual tag database, respectively.

differentially expressed genes
to identify the differentially expressed genes  in t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries, a rigorous algorithm was developed. the tag frequencies that appeared in libraries were used for estimating gene expression levels. the distribution of fold-changes of tag copy number showed that most of the tags were expressed at similar levels, showing a < 5-fold difference after 1 μm and  <dig>  μm tsa treatments and the maximum fold-change of the tag copy number was around  <dig> . after 1 μm tsa treatment, the expression levels of  <dig>  % tags were < 5-fold changed, while only  <dig>  % tags were up-regulated by at least five folds and  <dig>  % tags were down-regulated by at least five folds . after  <dig>  μm tsa treatment, the expression levels of  <dig>  76 % tags were < 5-fold changed, while only  <dig>  % tags were up-regulated by at least five folds and  <dig>  % tags were down-regulated by at least five folds . in our study, a threshold of false discovery rate  ≤  <dig>  and 2- fold change in expression level were used to judge the significance of gene expression difference . the red dots represented the abundance of transcripts higher than two folds and green dots represented transcripts lower than two folds in t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries in comparison with t <dig> library. the blue dots represented the abundance of transcripts less than two folds. a total of  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes were detected to be differentially expressed in t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries in comparison with t <dig> data set, respectively . of the differentially expressed genes,  <dig> genes were present in both t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries . after tsa treatment, most of the genes in roots were down-regulated. among all differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated after 1 μm tsa treatment, while  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated after  <dig>  μm tsa treatment . most of the differentially expressed genes had functional annotations, while some of the genes were not well characterized and of unknown functions.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed tags in two libraries. the tags were expressed at similar levels in t <dig>  and t <dig>   libraries. the “x” axis represents fold-change of differentially expressed distinct tags in two libraries. the “y” axis represents the number of distinct tags. the region in red color indicates distinct tags with a <5-fold fold-change in t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries. the regions in green and blue indicate the distinct tags up- and down-regulated for more than 5-folds in t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries, respectively

gene ontology functional analysis of degs
to better understand the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes , gene ontology  enrichment analysis was performed. go includes three ontologies, cellular component, molecular function and biological process, describing properties of genes and their products in any organism. each of the ontologies is composed of go-terms. go enrichment analysis applies a hypergeometric test to map all degs to terms in the go database, searching for significantly enriched go terms which are defined by a threshold of corrected-p value ≤  <dig> . a total of  <dig> degs in t <dig> library and  <dig> degs in t <dig>  in comparison with t <dig> library were classified into the three main ontologies, respectively. for t <dig> library in comparison with t <dig>   <dig> genes were mapped to the significantly enriched go terms  and could be categorized into  <dig> functional groups . for t <dig>  library in comparison with t <dig>   <dig> genes were mapped to the significantly enriched go terms  and could be categorized into  <dig> functional groups . in the presence of 1 μm tsa, most of the differentially expressed genes were associated with cellular component or involved in biological processes. however, under  <dig>  μm tsa treatment, most of the differentially expressed genes were specially categorized into the ontology of molecular function, including go terms “active transporter activity”, “iron ion binding”, “antioxidant activity”, “oxidoreductase activity”, “oxidoreductase activity acting on paired donors” and “copper-transporting atpase activity”. for t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries, the common go terms include “active transporter activity”, “response to stimulus” and “response to stress”.fig.  <dig> histogram showing gene ontology functional enrichment analysis of degs. transcripts were classified into three different categories, cellular component, molecular function and biological process



pathway analysis for degs
to further characterize the function of the differentially expressed genes in t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries, we mapped the genes to terms in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database to identify significantly enriched metabolic or signal transduction pathways . among the mapped pathways, four pathways were significantly enriched  in roots grown on the medium containing 1 μm tsa. most of the genes in the four enriched pathways, including nitrogen metabolism  , ribosome  , fructose and mannose metabolism  , and glutathione metabolism  , were down-regulated. nitrogen metabolism is important for plant growth and development. proteins are synthesized by ribosomes. thus the down-regulation of the genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and ribosomal protein synthesis may impair normal growth and development of roots. for the roots grown on the medium supplemented with  <dig>  μm tsa, ten pathways were significantly enriched  and the top two abundant pathways were metabolic  and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites . most of the genes in the ten pathways were down-regulated. the genes in the nitrogen metabolism pathway , photosynthesis-antenna proteins , anthocyanin biosynthesis , diterpenoid biosynthesis , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway , and flavones and flavonol biosynthesis  were down-regulated. some genes in phenylalanine metabolism  and glutathione metabolism  were up-regulated. the genes in the metabolic pathway, diterpenoid/ga, and nitrogen metabolic may play a significant role in plant growth and development. the flavones and flavonol biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and phenypropanoid biosynthesis were important for plant stress tolerance  <cit> .fig.  <dig> histogram illustrating pathway enrichment analyses



effect of tsa on the ga biosynthesis pathway
gibberellins , as a large family of tetracyclic diterpenoid, regulate plant growth and development such as seed germination, stem elongation, flowering, fruit development, and circadian and light regulation  <cit> . the growth and development of root system were regulated by ga as well. in our study, diterpenoid/ga biosynthesis pathway was significantly enriched after roots were grown on the medium supplemented with  <dig>  μm tsa for two weeks. a total of four genes participating in ga biosynthesis, including ko, kao, ga20ox and ga3ox, were detected in t <dig>  library and all of them were down-regulated . ko  encoded enzyme ent-kaurene oxidase and kao  encoded ent-kaurenoic acid hydroxylase. genes potri.001g <dig> and potri.001g <dig> were homologues of arabidopsis ga20ox and ga3ox which encoded ga 20-oxidase and ga 3-oxidase. the expression levels of these genes were confirmed by real-time pcr . the real-time pcr results were consistent with the data obtained by dge analysis. these findings revealed that inhibition of hdac enzyme activity by tsa resulted in the down-regulation of genes in ga biosynthesis pathway.fig.  <dig> gibberellin biosynthesis pathway in populus roots in response to  <dig>  μm tsa treatment. the expression of four genes encoding enzymes catalyzing ga biosynthesis  was down-regulated on exposure to  <dig>  μm tsa for 2 weeks

fig.  <dig> real-time pcr validations of ga biosynthesis genes. the expression levels of genes participating in ga biosynthesis, potri.002g <dig> , potri.014g <dig> , potri.001g <dig> and potri.001g <dig> , were analyzed by real-time pcr. the pcr results were consistent with the data in dge analysis



confirmation of differentially expressed genes by quantitative real-time pcr
to verify the dge data, nine genes were selected for quantitative real-time pcr analysis . the representative genes selected for the analysis included two genes related to root development, potri.006g <dig> ) and potri.003g <dig> ), and two populus hdac genes, potri.009g <dig>  and potri.001g <dig> . the expression changes of the nine genes in dge analysis were consistent with the results obtained by real-time pcr. it is interesting that populus hda <dig> and hda <dig> genes were able to be regulated by tsa.fig.  <dig> real-time pcr validations of tag-mapped genes. relative level, 2−△△ct; tpm, transcript per million mapped reads



discussion
tsa modified the de novo organogenesis of roots
tissue culture is an effective and fast method to obtain seedlings for many woody plants. in woody plants such as populus and birch, detached shoots are generally cultured on medium containing appropriate plant hormones and nutrient to regenerate roots. in order to improve the regeneration rate of roots, the hormones such as auxin and cytokinin, components of medium, or culture conditions such as temperature, humanity and lightening were usually adjusted. nevertheless, for many woody plants, regeneration of adventitious roots from detached tissues or organs is still difficult. to date, it has not been fully understood that root regeneration may be epigenetically regulated. in our work, we examined the role of histone deacetylases in de novo root organogenesis using hdac specific inhibitor tsa. tsa treatment inhibited populus root organogenesis in a dose-dependent manner , suggesting that hdacs were required for populus root regeneration from detached shoots under tissue culture conditions. this finding might shed light on the organogenesis of those woody plants which are difficult to obtain regenerated seedlings by tissue culture method.

differentially expressed genes 
histone deacetylases  catalyze histone deacetylation and are usually associated with the repression of gene transcription. tsa, as a hdac specific inhibitor, is expected to have a role to increase histone acetylation levels, thus leading to up-regulation of genes. however, interestingly, most of the differentially expressed genes in roots were down-regulated on exposure to tsa, especially when roots were exposed to 1 μm tsa. it appeared that histone acetylation may have a positive or negative role in gene activation. in yeast, histone deacetylation not only repress genes but can be required for gene activation  <cit> . using spotted oligo-gene microarray, tian et al. investigated the expression of genes in athda <dig> t-dna insertion mutant   <cit> . over 7 % of the transcriptome was modified. in leaves and flowers of the athd1-t <dig> mutant, relatively equal numbers of genes were up- or downregulated. these findings indicate that histone acetylation may activate or repress the transcription of genes, which is consistent with our result. in our study, the populus roots were regenerated on wpm medium containing different concentrations of tsa . organogenesis and development of the roots were inhibited by tsa in a dose-dependent manner, which were consistent with the finding in arabidopsis  <cit> . in order to know whether the genes were modified by tsa in a dose-dependent manner, the expression levels of degs in the libraries were compared. after comparison, only three genes exhibited dose-dependent manner when roots were subjected to different concentrations of tsa, suggesting that the expression of genes in response to tsa was not in a dose-dependent manner. in t <dig> library, most of the degs  were not found in t <dig>  library, while almost half of the degs in t <dig>  library were not included in t <dig> library, indicating that different sets of genes in roots were modified at each concentration . the morphological difference of the roots under  <dig> and  <dig>  μm tsa treatments might be due to different genes were modified during root development.

stress-responsive genes
in our experiment, the growth of populus roots was inhibited after long-term growth on medium supplemented with tsa . it is well known that stresses such as salt, cold, drought and heavy metals were able to induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species  and inhibit root growth. we examined the ros accumulation in roots on exposure to different concentrations of tsa for 2 weeks. no significant increases of ros were observed in roots in response to tsa treatment . additionally, we examined the expression levels of genes encoding ros scavenging enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , catalase , peroxidase  and glutathione s-transferase  in the three dge libraries and their expression levels were proved by using real-time pcr. a total of  <dig> genes encoding the four ros scavenging enzymes were available by searching national center for biotechnology information  and they could be detected in the t <dig> and t <dig>  dge libraries . of the ten genes, no one was significantly up-regulated. however, four genes encoding cats , po <dig> and gst u <dig>  respectively were significantly down-regulated . whereas, the expression of the four genes appeared not to be dose-dependent since their expression levels were not significantly different under  <dig> and  <dig>  μm tsa treatments. base on the analysis of ros accumulation and the expression of ros scavenging genes in the roots, we proposed that the inhibition of root growth on exposure to tsa was not due to ros accumulation.fig.  <dig> ros accumulation in roots in response to tsa treatments. the detached shoots were transferred onto medium supplemented with indicated concentrations of tsa. after 2 weeks the regenerated roots were collected for dab staining to check the accumulation level of h2o2


fig.  <dig> real-time pcr validations of ros scavenging genes. relative level, 2−△△ct; tpm, transcript per million mapped reads



in our study, the common go terms for t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries included “active transporter activity”, “response to stimulus” and “response to stress”, implying a relationship between hdacs and stimuli/stress responses in populus roots. current available data from herbaceous plants such as arabidopsis, rice and maize have shown that hdacs are involved in stress responses. in plants, the expression of hdac genes was regulated by abscisic acid , jasmonic acid , salicylic acid , ethylene, biotic  or abiotic stresses . meanwhile, the alteration of hdac levels because of overexpression, mutation or rnai-mediated repression could affect the expression levels of some stress-responsive genes  <cit> . in our experiment, hdac activity was inhibited by tsa and some genes encoding ros scavenging enzymes such as cat, pod and gst were proved to be down-regulated, suggesting that hdacs were required for ros scavenging. based on the evidence from other plants and our current findings, we hypothesized that the inhibition of hdac activity by tsa might alleviate the control of hdacs on target genes and, as a result, the transcription of some genes involved in stress/stimulus responses were altered. our data suggested the possibility that stimulus- and stress-responsive genes were directly or indirectly regulated by hdacs in populus roots.

root development genes
root development is a complex process for many plants. studies of root system in the model plant arabidopsis advanced the understanding of root development. to date, functions of genes involved in root development, gene regulatory network, mechanisms regulating root development, and root development under stress conditions have been well characterized in arabidopsis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, many genes involved in root development had been identified and they participated in different processes of root development, including patterning and maintenance of the stem cell niche, meristem size control, xylem patterning, root hair pattering, lateral root initiation and patterning, lateral root emergence and auxin pathway  <cit> . we checked the expression of root development genes in the dge libraries. a total of  <dig> genes in t <dig> and t <dig>  libraries were available to be annotated to corresponding genes in arabidopsis . during root embryogenesis, root apical meristem  is established and provides new cells for root formation and growth. at the tip of the ram, a single layer of initial cells  surrounding the quiescent center , a group of less mitotically active cells, form the stem cell niche  <cit> . stem cells produce the vascular, endodermal, cortex, epidermal, lateral root cap cells, and columella root cap. qc has a role to maintain the identity of surrounding stem cells by the expression of wuschel-related homeobox  <dig> , which is controlled by clavata3/embryo surrounding region  peptide cle <dig> and the receptor-like kinase arabidopsis crinkly  <dig>   <cit> . the qc identity is specified by plethora  pathways and short root /scarecrow , transcription factors belonged to the gras  family. in arabidopsis, acr <dig> acted as a key factor in promoting formative cell divisions in the pericycle  <cit>  and shr mutation  highly reduced root growth  <cit> . vascular system of the plants is consisted of two types of tissues, xylem and phloem, to transport water, nutrients and photosynthates to and from the shoot. arabidopsis athb- <dig>  a member of a small homeodomain-leucine zipper family, is expressed in the vascular tissue and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. over-expression of athb- <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis reduced the number of lateral roots and higher order roots  <cit> . meanwhile, the diameter of the transgenic root was much larger than that of wild-type, suggesting the role of athb- <dig> in secondary growth of root. in populus, in our study, the expression levels of acr <dig> and shr in roots were down-regulated and athb- <dig> was up-regulated by tsa . based on the expression change and corresponding morphological alteration in root development in arabidopsis, the expression alterations of the genes were consistent with the developmental inhibition and morphological change of root system.

in the differentiation zone of root, one of the key features is the development of root hairs. root hairs are important for water and nutrient uptake and soil anchoring. epidermal cells produced in the ram may become hair cells or nonhair cells based on their relative positions to cells in the underlying cortical layer of the roots. an epidermal cell lies between underlying cortical cells  will develop as a root hair cell, while an epidermal cell adjacent to a single cortical cell  will develop as a nonhair cell  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the cellular pattern of root was determined by six patterning genes, caprice , enhancer of try and cpc , glabra  <dig> , gl <dig>  enhancer of glabra  <dig> , and transparent testa glabra . in nonhair cell, a complex of transcription factors gl <dig>  ttg <dig>  egl <dig> and wer directly activate transcription of the hair cell fate repressor gl <dig> and cpc. cpc moves into neighboring cells and inactivates the complex by replacing wer, resulting in the inactivation of gl <dig> and hair cell specification. xu et al.  reported that tsa treatment significantly altered the expression of genes cpc, gl <dig> and werewolf  in arabidopsis  <cit> . in our work, the patterning genes ttg <dig>  and gl <dig>  <cit>  were significantly down-regulated after 1 μm and  <dig>  μm tsa treatment, respectively. these results suggested the involvement of hdacs in the regulation of root hair patterning in populus.

root system includes primary roots and lrs. lrs were initiated from pericycle cells adjacent to the xylem poles in differentiation zone. pericycle cells initiate a series of asymmetric transverse and periclinal divisions and, as a result, a dome-shaped lateral root primordium  is formed, which leads to the emergence of lateral root  <cit> . lr development is regulated by auxin, involved complex regulation of auxin biosynthesis, auxin transportation and cellular appropriate response to auxin. the transport of auxin is important for lr development. arabidopsis aux <dig> is a putative auxin influx carrier. mutation of aux <dig> resulted in a reduction of iaa in root and the mutant  had a reduced number of lrp and fewer lateral roots than wild type  <cit> . in lr formation and development, many genes are regulated by auxin. the expression of auxin-responsive genes is regulated by two families of important proteins, auxin-response factors  and auxin/indole-3-aceticacids . arfs are transcriptional activator of auxin-responsive genes and positively regulate lr formation, while aux/iaas can inhibit the activity of specific arfs. in presence of auxin, auxin binds to its receptor transport inhibitor response <dig> , which promotes the degradation of aux/iaa proteins by ubiquitin-ligase complex. the degradation of aux/iaa proteins derepresses the activity of arfs, such as arf <dig> and arf <dig>  and allow auxin-responsive genes to be expressed, which leads to the initiation of lr formation  <cit> . in arabidopsis, arf <dig> and arf <dig> double mutation  strongly inhibited the lateral root formation at the very early stage of lr initiation  <cit> . in addition, monopteros /arf <dig> is another important regulator in lr development. the arf <dig> mutant  failed to form root meristem  <cit> . in transgenic arabidopsis over-expressing arf <dig>  closely positioned lateral root initiation sites and aberrantly spaced lateral root primordia were occasionally observed  <cit> . these finding indicated that arf <dig> is involved in lr formation. in our study, the lr formation and root growth were observed to be inhibited by tsa treatment, especially under  <dig>  μm tsa treatment . after examination of deg profiles, several genes related to lr development such as arf <dig>  <cit> , arf <dig>  <cit>  and auxin resistant  <dig>   <cit>  were found to be differentially down-regulated, even though the fold-changes of the genes were not statistically significant . based on functions of the corresponding genes in arabidopsis, the down-regulation of these genes in populus might contribute, at least in part, to the inhibition of lateral root formation. additionally, in arabidopsis, s-phase kinase-associated protein 2b , encoding an f-box protein, has recently been reported to play a negatively regulatory role in cell cycle and lr formation  <cit> . in this study, the promoter of skp2b was regulated by h <dig> acetylation in an auxin- and iaa14-dependent manner and skp2b mutant has longer roots and more lrs than control plants  <cit> . in our experiment, the expression of skp2b-like gene  was not detectable in the roots of plants without tsa treatment, while its expression levels in the roots treated by different concentrations of tsa were much higher, especially under  <dig>  μm tsa treatment . the induction of skp2b might be related to the short root and less lr observed in populus roots after tsa treatments .

gas, as phytohormones, played an essential role in both primary root elongation and lr development . available evidence showed that root growth of many plants was altered due to the change of ga levels such as application of gas to root system, supplementation of ga-biosynthesis inhibitors, alteration of genes in ga pathway, or mutations of genes involved in ga biosynthesis. gas may play a negative or positive role in promoting root growth. the work of gou and colleagues  showed that shortage of gas promoted root growth and lr development  <cit> . ga-deficient  and ga-insensitive  transgenic populus exhibited increased lr proliferation and elongation, and these effects were reversed by exogenous ga treatment  <cit> . although gas appeared to have a negative role in root growth and development in gou and colleagues’ work, gas played a positive role in promoting root system development in many plants. della proteins function as growth repressors to repress ga signaling. in arabidopsis, application of gas to root system promoted root growth by targeting the degradation of della proteins, repressors ga1– <dig>  and gibberellin insensitive , in elongation zone tissues such as epidermal, cortical, endodermal and stele tissues  <cit> . gai mutation, gai, rendered the gai protein resistance to ga-dependent disruption and the root growth of gai mutants was significantly reduced. uniconazole p  is a ga biosynthesis inhibitor. un-p at the concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> nm were able to significantly inhibit the growth of roots in lemna minor  <cit> . in pea, the genes na, lh- <dig>  and ls- <dig> encode enzymes catalyzing ga biosynthesis  <cit> . mutation of the genes, na, lh- <dig>  and ls- <dig>  reduced ga levels in roots and the length of roots was 50 %, < 15 % and < 15 % decreased, respectively  <cit> . these findings indicated that gas played a positive role in promoting root growth. in arabidopsis, ga biosynthesis was majorly catalyzed by enzymes such as copalyl diphosphate synthase , ent-kaurene synthase , ko, kao, ga 20-oxidase, ga 3-oxidase and ga 2-oxidase  <cit> . in our work, ga biosynthesis pathway in the populus roots subjected to  <dig>  μm tsa was significantly altered . four genes involved in ga biosynthesis, including ko, kao, ga20ox and ga3ox, were detected to be down-regulated in the roots . we speculate that the repression of genes involved in ga biosynthesis might be associated with the inhibition of root growth by tsa. our findings suggested the regulatory role of hdacs in ga biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
regeneration of roots from shoots and root growth were inhibited by tsa in populus. a digital gene expression  approach was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the populus roots exposed to different concentrations of tsa. in comparison with the control sample, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were detected to be differentially expressed in the roots subjected to 1 μm and  <dig>  μm tsa, respectively. most of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated on exposure to tsa. go and pathway analyses showed that the degs were related to many kinds of molecular functions and biological processes. the dge data provides a large set of candidate genes probably regulated by hdacs in root development.
