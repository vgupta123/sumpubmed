BACKGROUND
truffles are hypogeous ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes belonging to the order pezizales. the most sought-after species belong to the tuber genus and include tuber melanosporum vittad. , tuber magnatum pico , tuber aestivum vittad.  and tuber borchii vittad. . amongst these the italian white truffle commands the highest prices. this truffle grows in many regions of italy: from piedmont in the north, where alba is the most famous production area, to basilicata in the extreme south of italy  <cit> . it is also found in croatia and has recently been found, although in small quantities, in romania, serbia, hungary and slovenia  <cit> .

methods have been developed to produce t. magnatum infected trees using spore inoculation techniques  <cit>  or root organ cultures  <cit> . however, while some successes are reported  <cit>  in general attempts to cultivate this truffle species have met with failure  <cit> . this failure to produce t. magnatum fruiting bodies from cultivated plots has been compounded by falling harvests from natural truffières, attributed to deforestation, changing forest management practices, global warming since the last ice age as well as acid rain  <cit> . these factors have spurred efforts to carry out research aimed at safeguarding t. magnatum production in natural truffières and developing tools to evaluate their state of “health”.

in contrast to the other truffles such as t. melanosporumt. aestivum and t. borchii, which are comparatively easy to cultivate, t. magnatum mycorrhizas are scarce or absent even where their ascomata are found  <cit> . on the other hand, recent studies have shown that t. magnatum mycelium is widely distributed in the soil of truffières and its presence is not restricted to just those points where mycorrhizas or ascomata are found  <cit> . these observations suggest that t. magnatum soil mycelium could be a better indicator than mycorrhiza for assessing its presence in the soil.

dna-based techniques have been extensively applied to study fungal ecology in soil  <cit> . recently, real-time pcr has made it possible not only to detect and monitor the distribution of a particular fungus but also its abundance  <cit> . knowledge of the distribution, dynamics and activities of tuber spp. mycelium in soil can be considered crucial for monitoring the status of a cultivated truffle orchard before ascoma production  <cit> . it is also a powerful tool for assessing truffle presence in natural forests in those countries where ascoma harvesting is forbidden  <cit>  or where all truffle collectors have open access to forests and woodlands  <cit> . this is particularly important for t. magnatum as the truffle production sites, in natural truffières, are dispersed and not visible to the naked eye, unlike black truffles  which produce burnt areas  around the productive trees where grass development is inhibited  <cit> .

in this study a specific real-time pcr assay using taqman chemistry was developed to detect and quantify t. magnatum in soil. this technique was then applied to four natural t. magnatum truffières in different italian regions to validate the method under different environmental conditions.

RESULTS
dna extraction
successful application of molecular-based techniques for dna analyses of environmental samples strongly depends on the quality of the dna extracted  <cit> . moreover, the heterogeneous distribution of fungi in soil with small samples  can lead to an unrepresentative fungal fingerprinting  <cit> . for this reason total dna was isolated from 15 g of lyophilized soil for each plot , selected from about 60 g of sampled soil from each plot, using a procedure specifically developed to obtain good quality extracts regardless of the different soil types analysed in this study. to obtain equal 3 ml-solutions of crude dna from the different soils we had to process samples from emilia-romagna/tuscany and molise/abruzzo truffle areas with different quantities of ctab lysis buffer  at the beginning of the extraction step. a total of  <dig> extractions  were successfully carried out using this improved method. the mean quantity of dna isolated from samples processed in this study range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg g− <dig> of soil for the molise and tuscan truffières respectively.

anova was performed to determine whether the quantities of dna isolated from the sampled soil varied in the different truffières. the data reveal significant differences  between dna isolated from the soil samples of the different truffières . the lowest values were obtained from samples collected in the molise and abruzzo truffières. this may be due to the higher clay content in the soil of these two experimental truffières. indeed, dna extraction is difficult for soils containing clay  <cit>  and dna adsorption and desorption is strongly affected by the clay type and content  <cit> . other factors such as climate, soil, and vegetation conditions may however also contribute to modifying microbial activity below ground and consequently the quantity of total dna isolated.

primer and probe selection
the its regions were chosen to develop an appropriate primer/probe set for the detection and quantification of t. magnatum. the use of these genomic regions as the target for real time pcr-amplification has proven to be a successful strategy for different ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil  <cit> . this is due to the large number of sequences available in genetic databases that make its regions suitable for designing reliable species-specific primers. moreover, the presence of multiple copies of rdna units within each fungal genome also make it possible to detect low quantities of the target dna  <cit> . its regions are not, however, equally variable in all groups of fungi  <cit>  and this could represent a limitation for designing a specific primer in some species  <cit> . the alignment of about  <dig> its1- <dig>  s-its <dig> t. magnatum sequences retrieved from the genbank database highlighted a high level of conservation of its regions in this species , higher than those found in other truffle species  <cit> .

a single primer/probe set was selected for both the its <dig> and the its <dig> region  based on in silico analyses of their composition, tm, pcr-impairing structure formation and specificity against the sequences in genbank. both of the primer pairs selected produced specific amplicons of the expected size for all the t. magnatum specimens considered in this study and gave no cross-reactions with other fungal species under qualitative pcr conditions . specificity of the probes was also confirmed . however, the primers and probe designed from its <dig> were selected for the subsequent real-time pcr analyses, as they provided more efficient amplification . indeed, the tmgits1for-tmgits1rev primer pair allowed detection of the specific amplicon down to dilutions of 1/ <dig> , ten fold lower than tmgits2for-tmgits2rev. the specificity of the its <dig> primer/probe set was also confirmed under real-time pcr conditions for all soil samples processed.

real time quantification of t. magnatum dna
the real-time assay showed reliable amplification over the  <dig> orders of magnitude generating almost identical standard curves from each run quantifying t. magnatum dna in soil samples. the correlation coefficients  were always higher than  <dig>  and amplification efficiency was about 85%. the mean standard curve resulting from  <dig> independent plates is shown in figure  <dig>  the detection limit for real-time pcr with the its <dig> primer/probe set was approximately 10 fg. however, since standard replicates containing less than 100 fg of t. magnatum dna gave inconsistent amplifications, to avoid the inclusion of false positive test results, values lower than this threshold were considered as  <dig> 

detection of t. magnatum ascomata and dna
truffle production was scattered and localized in only  <dig> of the  <dig> plots examined. a total of 74 t. magnatum ascomata, for a total weight of  <dig>  g, were collected over the 3-year period of investigation in the  <dig> experimental truffières .

there was a high variation in the concentration of t. magnatum dna detected by real-time pcr in the  <dig> samples processed, even from the same plot, over the three years of sampling thus confirming that mycelium varies considerably in the soil over time  <cit> . no fluorescence was ever recorded in dna from the soil samples collected outside the truffière in any of the experimental sites.

the mean concentration of t. magnatum dna detected in the four different truffières was statistically different indicating that environmental condition, such as climate, vegetation, soil chemical and biological characteristics, influence the relative quantity of t. magnatum dna in the soil . the lowest mean concentration of target dna was associated with the soil samples collected in the molise truffière. in this experimental site significant amounts of t. magnatum dna were only detected in the unique plot that produced ascomata during the 3 years of the survey. on the contrary, soil samples from the tuscan truffière showed the highest mean value for dna concentration and positive real-time amplifications were obtained for all plots. t. magnatum dna was also found in plots that never produced truffles during the three years of the study . this can be explained by the fact that, in soil, t. magnatum mycelium is able to develop as far as 100 m from the production points  <cit> , thus forming large mycelial patches that may colonize other contiguous plots. higher mean values for t. magnatum dna concentrations were however obtained from productive plots  even if in tuscany and abruzzo no significant differences were found between productive and non-productive plots. this is probably due to the high percentage of productive plots of these two truffières where mycelial patches may have overlapped. despite this, there was a significant correlation  between the mean t. magnatum dna concentration and plot productivity . these results indicate that the production of t. magnatum fruiting bodies is positively related to the presence of mycelium in the soil although the fructification process is limited in space by other factors which are still not clear.

in previous studies of t. melanosporum it was found that the presence of a burnt area around a tree infected by t. melanosporum was related to the quantity of its mycelium in the soil  <cit> . these authors, however, found a higher quantity of the mycelium in non-productive trees and explained this as a shift in resource allocation by the fungal ascoma. in our study we found the highest quantity of t. magnatum dna in the productive plots, indicating that this truffle species has a different behaviour in the soil. as t. magnatum mycorrhizas are rare or absent in the productive areas and probably unable to support fruiting body formation, its free live mycelium should provide a sufficient quantity of nutrients to support ascoma formation and successive development. it has already been shown that after their formation in the soil truffle ascomata have a saprobic phase and, during their maturation, become nutritionally independent on the host plant. probably, in t. magnatum, this saprobic phase is much more important than previously considered and as also suggested by zampieri et al.  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported here demonstrate that the real-time pcr assay developed in this study can be an effective tool for quantifying t. magnatum in the soil and for monitoring the presence of this precious fungus, regardless of truffle production. this technique could be a useful tool to evaluate the “health” of natural and cultivated truffières and to assess the effect of different cultivation techniques. this aspect is particularly important because in natural truffières ascoma production is dispersed and depends on annual climatic conditions. thus many years of survey are necessary to evaluate the effects of any new variable. moreover, it is difficult to assess truffle production in natural truffières because in italy there is no control of truffle harvesting in the forests and numerous different truffle hunters may visit a single truffière in one day  <cit> .

real-time pcr will make it possible to carry out further studies on the spatial and seasonal changes in the quantity of t. magnatum mycelium in the soil to gain more knowledge on its biology and ecology.
