BACKGROUND
human cell lines are widely used to accurately assess the toxic properties and activities of both novel and well-known chemical entities. these experiments are important for the pharmaceutical, chemical, medical and cosmetic industries. typically, cell line-based assays are preferred to those based on animal models, reflecting the low cost, high reproducibility and bioethical rationale for these assays. one of the most frequently modeled organs of the human organism is the liver, a central organ for the maintenance of chemical homeostasis that participates in the synthesis of proteins and detoxification.

the human hepatoma hepg <dig> cell line  has been widely used as an in vitro model of the human liver because these cells display a high degree of morphological and functional differentiation in vitro, are easy to handle, do not contain viruses and generate reproducible results. this cell line was recovered from a 15-year-old boy with well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. while new promising liver models like pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells are becoming available
 <cit> , hepg <dig> cells have been used in toxicological studies of liver metabolism and the toxic effects of xenobiotics and in pharmacological studies on drug targeting and carcinogenesis
 <cit> .

gene expression profiling is a powerful tool that has provided numerous insights in previous studies. while rt-pcr and microarrays are commonly used to assess transcriptomic activity, whole-transcriptome high-throughput sequencing  provides the most extensive evaluation, with a wide dynamic range and higher sensitivity
 <cit> . considering the high cost of experiments based on this technology, a thorough experimental design is important. here, we performed a rigorous assessment of the contribution of each of the main experimental factors ceteris paribus to the gene expression profile and compared the results with those reported in existing studies performed using another rna-seq platform  and previous technology . in addition, we derived a characteristic signature for the hepg <dig> transcriptome compared with liver tissue via differential gene expression analysis, and these results were also compared with previously published results obtained using microarrays.

RESULTS
whole transcriptome of the hepg <dig> cell line
the  <dig> technical replicates, hi <dig>  hi <dig>  and hi <dig>  contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> million reads, respectively, with a read length of 50 bp. at the filtering stage,  <dig> - <dig> % of the total number of reads that aligned with the sequences of human rrna and solid adapters were discarded. subsequently, 68%-75% of the reads were successfully mapped to the human genome. more than  <dig>  genes were expressed in each sample .

validation using ddpcr as a complementary approach
droplet digital polymerase chain reaction  is a new technology that facilitates the quantification of target nucleic acids in a sample
 <cit> . for the hepg <dig> cell line, the ddpcr was implemented to measure  <dig> selected rna transcripts. the gene copy number per 1 μg of total rna varied from  <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> . a good correlation was observed between the ddpcr and the rna-seq three replicates in general , as well as when the genes were binned according to their fold change between hepg <dig> cell line and liver, as detected by solid rna-seq, as described below .figure  <dig>

variation of the transcriptomic profile between the technical replicates and between samples prepared using different methods or different culturing conditions and comparison with liver tissue
for the comparative analysis, we compared the three technical replicates, hi1- <dig>  obtained from a sample cultured at the ibmc with the two rna-seq solid datasets generated from a single rna sample extracted from a hepg <dig> cell line cultivated at the research institute of physico-chemical medicine  in 2011: the first previously unpublished library  was prepared as described in the methods section , while the second published library
 <cit>   was prepared using a different protocol . in the present study, we also included liver transcriptomes obtained with the solid platform 
 <cit>  using method m. because the data were obtained on identical platforms using identical formats , we were able to assess the contribution of each of the experimental factor to the quantitative transcriptomic profile. the summary of the solid samples is shown in table 
 <dig>  to assess the general variation of gene expression across sequencing platforms, we included two illumina datasets - one from the encode project
 <cit>   and another from van delft et al.
 <cit>  .table  <dig>

all other factors held equal, the lowest spearman correlation of rpkm values was observed between the hepg <dig> cell line and liver tissue . the next most dissimilar datasets were derived from hepg <dig> cells prepared using different protocols , followed by the hepg <dig> samples from two different laboratories . the technical replicates were the most strongly correlated .figure  <dig>

comparison of different hepg <dig> transcriptomes
the effects of experimental conditions and sample preparation were evaluated by the identification of the genes that were differentially expressed across the corresponding pairs of hepg <dig> datasets. to assess the “laboratory effect”, we compared the hepg <dig> transcriptomes prepared using the same protocol  originating from laboratories at two different research institutes - ibmc and ripcm: group hi  and hr_m, respectively. consistent with the general high correlation, most of the expressed genes varied moderately between the datasets, with a log2-fold change of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . for the  <dig> housekeeping genes listed in additional file
3: table s <dig>  the variation was even lower, showing a log2-fold change of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the most variable genes  included  <dig> genes that were up-regulated and  <dig> genes that were down-regulated in the hi group  and enriched for small nucleolar rnas .

similarly, to assess the influence of the sample preparation on the gene expression profile, we compared the hepg <dig> transcriptomes obtained from the same physical sample prepared using two protocols: method m  and method c . the differences were more significant than between two laboratories : the log2-fold change for the most highly expressed genes between the datasets was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and the expression of the housekeeping genes was also profoundly changed: the log2-fold change was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the list of the most variable genes  was more extensive and included  <dig>  genes that were up-regulated and  <dig> genes that were down-regulated in hr_m . the go enrichment analysis generated several enriched terms with low adjusted p-values ; however, the ratio of enrichment, reflecting the effect size, was quite low . therefore, the underlying biological effect of these differences was not significant.

in order to compare the hepg <dig> transcriptome obtained using amplification-based platform  with the single-molecule sequencing, we sequenced hepg <dig> cell line transcriptome on helicos platform. after calculation of gene expression levels, due to the wide range of order of gene expression level magnitude the genes were binned according to their fold change between hepg <dig> cell line and liver, as detected by solid rna-seq, as described below; the bin-wise correlation was high . another cross-platform validation was performed by comparing the hepg <dig> transcriptomes obtained in the present study using solid with the previously published rna-seq data obtained from other research groups on an illumina platform. the hi_ <dig> dataset was selected as a representative of the hi group, and these data were highly correlated with the hepg <dig> transcriptome from the encode project . similarly, hi_ <dig> was highly correlated with the rna-seq data from van delft et al.
 <cit>  .

in addition, we compared the rna-seq data obtained in the present study with the published in addition, we compared the rna-seq data obtained in the present study with the published hepg <dig> transcriptomes obtained using rna expression microarrays. a search of the geo database yielded four studies  containing the microarray gene expression profiles for  <dig> control hepg <dig> samples. the correlation of these profiles with the rna-seq hepg <dig> data obtained herein was modest, but it was higher than the correlation with the liver data . the transcriptomes obtained using method m were slightly more similar to the microarrays than the data obtained using method c .

hepatocarcinomic signature of hepg <dig> gene expression profile
differential gene expression analysis was performed between the liver tissue and hepg <dig> transcriptomes. the liver group included l <dig> and l <dig>  while hepg <dig> was represented by two samples from two laboratories treated as biological replicates: hr_m originated from the ripcm laboratory, and hi <dig> - hi <dig> originated from the ibmc laboratory. the availability of more than one biological replicate of hepg <dig> in one of the groups allowed the application of the statistical model from the edger package. we performed a genewise exact test for differences in the means  to identify the most significant variations. before the analysis, all respective technical replicates were pooled. only  <dig>  genes covered by > <dig> reads in at least one sample were considered. with an fdr-adjusted p-value threshold of  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed .

fifty of these genes were up-regulated in hepg <dig> cells . the enrichment analysis of the go terms using webgestalt  yielded  <dig> significantly enriched biological processes . the enriched terms included genes involved in the cell cycle  and cell division . on a more detailed level, the processes related to mitotic cell division were predominant . particularly, the genes responsible for chromosome condensation, organelle fission and microtubule cytoskeleton organization were overexpressed. the observed phenomena were obviously associated with the active division of hepg <dig> cells.

from a different angle, the webgestalt analysis of the associations between the  <dig> up-regulated genes and diseases showed aneuploidy among the  <dig> most enriched disease terms  , adenoma , chromosome aberrations , liver neoplasms  and hepatocellular carcinoma , suggesting an association of these genes with the oncological status of hepg <dig> cells. to confirm this finding, we characterized the potential associations between the up-regulated genes in hepg <dig> cells and hepatoma using the liver cancer-related gene signature database, liverome
 <cit> . for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, increased expression is observed in liver cancer compared with healthy controls, and this increase is associated with the aggressiveness of the tumor and a worse prognosis . these associations from the existing studies also reflected the fact that hepg <dig> cells are derived from a hepatocarcinoma.

response to stimulus is reflected by the gene expression in the liver
the analysis of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in the liver compared with the hepg <dig> cell line  identified  <dig> enriched go biological processes . the highest number of the genes  belonged to the term “response to stimulus” . on a lower level,  <dig> of these genes were associated with “response to chemical stimulus” , particularly, the  <dig> genes for “xenobiotic metabolic process” . the activation of the defense response genes was also observed .

another large enriched term was “small molecule metabolic process” , including the  <dig> genes involved in carboxylic acid metabolism , particularly monocarboxylic acid metabolism . carboxylic acid metabolism is activated in response to the need to provide energy for the detoxification processes and secretory activities of the liver , and the cell “boosts” its metabolism to synthesize atp at an increasing rate. moreover, carboxylic acids are involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, 10% of which is produced in the liver as a precursor for the synthesis of bile acids and steroid hormones.

consistently, processes associated with electron carrier  and oxidoreductase activities , primarily provided through the liver cytochrome system, are predominant. the high excretory-secretory activity in the tested liver tissue cells was mirrored by the increased expression of the extracellular region  and extracellular matrix  genes. activation of these genes is primarily caused by the expression of the cell surface receptors, the production of blood plasma components, the complement system and interleukins. furthermore, the enrichment of collagen synthesis  is a logical consequence of hepatocyte physiology.

consistent with the results obtained for the go terms, the  <dig> most enriched kegg pathways  included “drug metabolism - cytochrome p450”, “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450” and “drug metabolism - other enzymes” . moreover, the increased expression of the genes involved in the “retinol metabolism” pathway is consistent with the breakdown of dietary vitamin a  in the small intestine and the release of retinol. retinol is transported to the liver in the form of chylomicrons where it is converted into retinyl esters that are accumulated in liver cells
 <cit> .

among other kegg pathways, the observed enrichment of the “steroid hormone biosynthesis” pathway primarily reflects the presence of enzymes responsible for steroid and bilirubin inactivation, another physiological function of the liver. the cholesterol synthesis enzymes were also up-regulated. the up-regulation of the “complement and coagulation cascades” pathway also reflects the physiological function of the liver, involving the synthesis and secretion  of essential plasma proteins, including the complement system and clotting factors.

discussion
transcriptomic profiling based on high-throughput sequencing  facilitates the analysis of gene expression at an unprecedented high dynamic range. global initiatives, including encode, have provided an extensive inventory of human tissues and helped to identify differentially expressed genes with subsequent applicability in clinical practice. we applied rna-seq using a solid  <dig> platform for deep transcriptomic profiling of hepg <dig> cells, a widely used laboratory cell line. a large amount of transcriptomic data for hepg <dig> cells is available, and most of these data have been generated using rna hybridization microarrays. recently, hepg <dig> transcriptomes have been examined using high-throughput sequencing on the illumina
 <cit>  and solid
 <cit>  platforms. the experiments described herein were performed on a single platform  using the same sequence format to eliminate the choice of platform as a confounding factor and focus on the influence of the other experimental factors for the evaluation of the hepg <dig> transcriptome and the determination of transcriptomic differences between the liver and hepg <dig> cells as a model system for this organ.

a comparison of the transcriptomic data obtained using the same sequencing platform revealed that the sample and sequencing library preparation protocol, not the “laboratory effect” as expected, had the highest contribution to the hepg <dig> gene signature. the minor differences in the expression profiles between the laboratories  likely reflect fluctuations in hepg <dig> cell metabolism between the two cultivation rounds and the rna extraction. given the high fraction of snornas among the differentially expressed genes, the fact that differential rna-seq analysis is inherently biased against profiling of short genes
 <cit>  could also contribute to these differences; however, the rpkm values for these snorna genes were not outlying . in contrast, the differences between the preparation methods  were much larger than those between the laboratories:  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified. however, the analysis of this group of genes did not reveal any biological relevance, consistent with the idea that the source of the variation was primarily technical and associated with the differences in the protocols’ steps . notably, the workflow of sample preparation method c is similar to the method used for microarrays, potentially accounting for the lower correlation between rna-seq using method m and microarrays than between method c and microarrays. our analysis was limited to examining two protocols in one laboratory and one of the protocols in another laboratory. obviously, a comparison of a greater number of protocols in each of a greater number of laboratories is needed to clarify the observed effects of these experimental factors. without denying the existence of protocols that do produce highly similar results, we would like to emphasize that the significant differences observed between the two established methods point out the need for a careful planning of sample preparation in rna-seq experiments.

the comparison of the hepg <dig> transcriptome obtained using the solid platform with the results of two published studies based on the illumina platform
 <cit>  showed high correlation , suggesting the consistency and comparability of the rna-seq data generated using these two prevalent high-throughput platforms, despite the effect of possible differences in biological material and sample preparation protocols. importantly, the correlation with helicos sequencing results was also high, supporting the comparability of the data obtained using amplification-based and single-molecule sequencing approached. the lower correlation with the microarray data was consistent with the published differences between the two technologies for expression profiling
 <cit> .

an omics-based comparison of the liver tissue  with traditional cell models is crucial for assessing the potential limitations of the in vitro experiments. here, we compared the hepg <dig> transcriptomic signature with that obtained with liver tissue biopsy material
 <cit> . the majority of the genes that were up-regulated in hepg <dig> cells were associated with cancer, while the genes that were up-regulated in the liver were associated with xenobiotic metabolism. considering these large groups, researchers should be wary when designing transcriptomic experiments using hepg <dig> cells as a liver model. if the target genes are associated with the oncology of interest, then the expression levels of these genes will be a strongly biased estimate of their levels in the liver. this fact has important implications for drug, toxicity and carcinogenicity testing. in addition, the increased levels of the genes associated with xenobiotic inactivation in the liver transcriptome could reflect the fact that the samples were biopsies obtained from the patients who were likely to receive medical treatment.

we compared the list of the genes that were differentially expressed between hepg <dig> cells and the liver  to the corresponding results obtained in another study of hepg <dig> cells and hepatocytes using microarrays
 <cit> . the analysis revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that were up-regulated and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that were down-regulated in hepg <dig>  as assessed using the rna-seq, were also detected using microarrays . none of the up-regulated genes identified in rna-seq was among the down-regulated genes identified through microarray, and only  <dig> of the down-regulated genes were among the up-regulated genes detected by microarray. while the rna-seq analysis was more specific, and the number of differentially expressed genes identified in the rna-seq analysis was an order of magnitude lower, the significance testing confirmed the general consistency of the results from the two studies .

a majority of the  <dig> genes that were up-regulated in hepg <dig> cells, identified through rna-seq but not microarray analysis, encoded proteins that are associated with active mitotic cell division, particularly the m phase of the mitotic cell cycle. this finding is logically explained by the biological difference between the samples compared in the two studies: in the present study, we compared a growing hepg <dig> cell line with a stationary liver biopsy sample, while costantini et al.
 <cit>  compared two cell lines, each dividing at a different rate; thus, these genes were not differentially expressed.

in contrast, among the  <dig> genes that were down-regulated in hepg <dig> cells, identified through rna-seq but not microarray analysis, the largest group  was associated with the go category “response to any stimulus”, with a majority of the genes responsible for detoxification. the next largest group comprised  <dig> genes  belonging to the go term “immune system process”. a high proportion of these genes are involved in the synthesis of blood plasma proteins and components of the immune system. both of these processes are physiological functions of the liver under normal conditions. therefore, the reduced expression of these genes in hepg <dig> cells compared with liver tissue is logical. the conditions for hepatocyte cultivation in vitro might have led to inactivation of these metabolic pathways, thus decreasing the differences in the hepg <dig> cell line.

in addition to the choice of transcriptome profiling technology and differences in the biological objects, other factors likely contribute to the variations between the two studies. one factor is the availability of biological replicates: costantini et al.
 <cit>  included  <dig> replicates per group, but these replicates were technical, not biological. in contrast, in the present rna-seq study, we had  <dig> sample for liver and  <dig> biological replicates for hepg <dig> cells. the availability of these biological replicates, i.e., two hepg <dig> samples from two different laboratories, allowed a more specific detection of the hepg <dig> gene expression signature based on the natural variability of the biological object. this fact must have contributed to the identification of a lower number of differentially expressed genes in the present study.

secondly, the statistical models were quite different between the studies. specifically, costantini et al.
 <cit>  used an “illumina custom” error model, which considers the gene levels to be distributed normally across the biological replicates; the details about the multiple testing adjustment were not specified. in the present study, we used edger software, which accounts for overdispersion across biological replicates, with application of multiple testing correction to the resulting gene list . this approach implies a higher specificity of the resulting set of differentially expressed genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we demonstrated that the transcriptomic profiles obtained using rna-seq are generally invariant across the sequencing platforms  and are reproducible for hepg <dig> cell lines across different laboratories. an evaluation of the experimental factors showed that the sample preparation protocol is the strongest factor influencing the gene expression profile.

we identified the characteristic differences in gene expression between hepg <dig> cells and liver tissue. although most genes showed insignificant changes, the genes showing significantly different expression outline the cancer-associated signature that should be highly considered when choosing the application of hepg <dig> cells as a model system for liver transcriptomics.

comparisons with other studies showed that the solid sequencing data are consistent with previous results and can be used in future studies as an external control for estimating biological variability and the quality of new data to optimize experimental design, including the calculation of coverage depth and number of replicates.
