BACKGROUND
integrins constitute a large family of adhesion molecules with important roles in cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions which condition both the maintenance of tissue integrity and the promotion of cellular migration. they are heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins composed of non-covalently associated single-pass transmembrane α and β subunits, which are expressed on a wide range of cells  <cit> . the biggest part of each integrin subunit is extracellular while transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail are typically reduced. the n-terminal domains of the α and β subunits associate to form the integrin headpiece, which contains the ligand binding site. the c-terminal segments traverse the plasma membrane and mediate interactions with the cytoskeleton and with signalling proteins  <cit> .

among the integrins, the leukocyte-specific β2-integrins  include four members:  cd11a/cd <dig>  on all leukocytes ;  cd11b/cd <dig>  mainly on myeloid cells ;  cd11c/cd <dig>  and  cd11d/cd <dig>  on monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . the individuals lacking functional β <dig> integrins due to mutations in the β <dig>  subunit develop the lad  i syndrome characterized by repeated infections. this disease demonstrated that β <dig> integrins are of relevant importance in  leukocyte development and maturation,  naïve cells circulation in secondary lymphoid tissues and  leukocytes transendothelial migration to injured tissue  <cit> .

lymphocyte function-associated antigen- <dig> , the most abundant and widespread in expression β2-integrin, binds to the membrane proteins termed intercellular adhesion molecules icam- <dig> to icam- <dig>  <cit> . several studies have shown that lfa- <dig> is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of diseases caused by repeats-in-toxin  -producing bacteria. the virulence of both actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  and mannheimia haemolytica  is clearly associated with the ligand-receptor interactions between their respective leukotoxin and cd11a/cd <dig>  which triggers the synthesis and release of a wide array of cytokines and chemoattractants that exacerbate inflammation, and ultimately results in massive leukolysis  <cit> . as actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the main causative agent of pneumonia in pigs, also produces toxins of the rtx family   <cit> , it is tempting to hypothesize that the pathogenesis of the disease similarly rely on an interaction with the porcine lfa- <dig>  on a more practical point of view, increasing our knowledge about this putative interaction could help the pig industry in controlling the economical losses and antibiotics abuses that are currently associated with a. pleuropneumoniae pneumonia  <cit> . the sus scrofa cd <dig>  subunit has been well characterized  <cit> , which is not the case of its partner in the lfa- <dig> heterodimer, cd11a. the purpose of this study is to report the cloning, sequencing and analysis of a cdna encoding porcine cd11a, thus giving the first opportunity to produce recombinant lfa- <dig> for studies focused on interactions between apx toxins and swine lfa- <dig> 

RESULTS
characterization of pocd11a-encoding cdna and deduced amino-acid sequence
the pocd11a cdna sequence contains an orf of  <dig> bp  or  <dig> bp  that codes for  <dig> or  <dig> aa followed by ~ <dig> bp that constitute the 3'-utr . the  <dig> aa mature pocd11a contains a 23-residue putative leader peptide , an extracellular domain of  <dig> residues , a single hydrophobic transmembrane region of  <dig> residues  and a short cytoplasmic tail of  <dig> residues  . six n-linked putative glycosylation sites  are found in the extracellular domain . the pocd11a possesses  <dig> cysteine residues, among which one is located into the cytoplasmic tail . a subset of integrin α chains , including cd11a, contain an i-domain  that is homologous to the family of von willebrand factor  a-type domains and to cartilage matrix protein  <cit> . the i-domain has been associated with ligand binding. its three-dimensional structure consists of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet core surrounded on both faces by seven α-helices. a short antiparallel strand occurs on one edge of this sheet  <cit> . the i-domain  contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site    <cit>  . the i-domain crystallisation has demonstrated that a "closed"  and an "open"  forms exist, and that the major conformational changes during transition from the closed to open states include a rearrangement of the cation-coordinating residues in the midas site, accompanied by a small inward movement of the α <dig> helix and a large downward shift of the mobile c-terminal α <dig> helix  <cit> . the extracellular domain of pocd11a contains seven internal repeats that surround the i-domain  <cit> . the degree of identity is highest among the three cooh-terminal repeats  and their central region  is similar to the ef hand divalent cation-binding motifs of troponin c, parvalbumin and galactose binding protein  <cit>  . all the n-glycosylation sites and all but one cysteine residues are found outside the i-region and divalent cation binding motifs , consistent with the hypothesis that these regions may undergo conformational changes important in ligand binding  <cit> . the cytoplasmic portion of pocd11a contains three potential phosphorylation sites and also a conserved "gffkr" basic sequence near the transmembrane region . the integrins become constitutively active when this sequence is deleted, the gffkr motif thus normally fixes the integrins in an inactive state  <cit> .

among the seven positive clones sequenced, two presented a supplementary "cag" codon  that codes for a glutamine  in position  <dig> . this addition is located in the extracellular domain of pocd11a, outside of the i-domain and divalent cation-binding motifs and, according to the goriv bioinformatic program, increased the length of an α-helix. the gln- <dig> addition was also observed in the human  and ovine  <cit>  cd11a cdnas. the gln addition could thus have a biological importance for the mature cd11a. studies of genomic sequences will permit to know if this addition represents two alleles or if it is generated by an alternative splicing.

comparison among species
overall, the general organization of porcine, human  <cit> , murine  <cit> , bovine  <cit>  and ovine  <cit>  cd11a proteins is quite similar . comparison between mature pocd11a sequence and its human, murine, bovine and ovine counterparts shows overall 77%, 69%, 78% and 77% identity, respectively, with the highest identity for the midas, the cation binding motifs and the transmembrane region and the lowest identity for the cytoplasmic tail . the high conservation of the midas and the putative cation binding motifs is consistent with an involvement of these regions in the functional activity of lfa- <dig> α subunit, as suggested by the requirement of mg2+ and ca2+ for cd11a/cd18-dependent cellular interactions  <cit>  or binding to purified icam- <dig>  <cit> . the transmembrane region shows also a high degree of conservation that could be explained by  physicochemical, and  functional constraints. indeed,  residues lying in the membrane have to possess a hydrophobic character to warrant liposolubility, which is confirmed by the presence of many leucine residues  and  bi-directional integrin signalling  is accomplished by transmission of information across the plasma membrane  <cit> . by contrast, the low conservation of the cooh-terminal part of the cytoplasmic tail suggests that it is not required to guarantee adequate functioning of lfa- <dig>  this is in agreement with the observation that truncation of the lfa- <dig> α subunit cytoplasmic domain has no effect on binding to icam- <dig>  whereas binding is markedly diminished by β subunit cytoplasmic domain truncation  <cit> . however, the part near the transmembrane region of the cytoplasmic tail, containing the "gffkr" sequence, is highly conserved . this is consistent with the stabilizing role of this motif for the alpha/beta complex, possibly because of its direct involvement in heterodimer formation  <cit> . residue glu- <dig> that is located in the linker following the i domain and that is known to be critical for communication to the β <dig> i-like domain, rolling, integrin extension and activation by mn2+ of firm adhesion  <cit>  is strictly conserved, too .

every cysteine residue in the mature porcine cd11a is present at the same location in human, murine, bovine and ovine cd11a, which is consistent with a role in maintaining the global structure of the protein. the mouse version distinguishes by an additional cysteine residue at position  <dig> within the extracellular portion. of six potential asn-glycosylation sites in porcine cd11a, the ones present at amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are strictly conserved. without predictable consequences on a functional point of view, one glycosylation site is only absent from porcine and murine cd11a . the mouse sequence shows additional glycosylation sites at position  <dig> and  <dig>  furthermore, the porcine asn-xaa-ser/thr sites in position  <dig> and  <dig> are also found in human and murine homologues but not specially in the ruminant sequences, and the ovine sequence owns two supplementary sites at position  <dig> and  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports for the first time the isolation and sequencing of the porcine lfa- <dig> αl subunit  cdna, and demonstrates that, despite some focal differences, it shares all the main characteristics of its known mammalian homologues. along with the porcine cd18-encoding cdna which is available  <cit> , the sequence data provided here allow the successful cloning of pocd11a, thus giving the first opportunity to express porcine lfa- <dig> in vitro as a tool to examine the specificities of inflammation in the porcine species.
