BACKGROUND
genomes of higher plants contain a large number of receptor-like kinases   <cit> . leucine-rich repeat rlk  form the largest subfamily within plant rlk and mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> . a group of potential receptor ligands for lrr-rlk are clv3/esr  signaling peptides, first described by cock and mccormick  <cit> , and recently reviewed  <cit> . altogether,  <dig> cle members are known from a variety of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. the single cle signaling peptide known to be present in a non-plant species is encoded by the plant parasitic nematode heterodera glycines  <cit> , and it has been proposed that the parasite acquired the plant signal to alter its host's behavior  <cit> . apart from this single exception, it has been suggested that cle signaling peptides are plant-specific  <cit> .

cock and mccormick  <cit>  reported a clv3-like gene family, that they identified using iterative searches with position-specific iterative blast . the authors were able to detect  <dig> sequences from genomic and expressed sequence tag  databases, yielding  <dig> related protein sequences. the protein family was termed clv3/esr-related  and is characterized by a conserved domain at the c-terminus spanning  <dig> residues and a hydrophobic signal peptide at the n-terminus. the variable region  of the protein is thought to have no specific function, as it can be substituted with nucleotides from other genes  <cit> .

the first identified cle members were termed esr genes as they were shown to be specifically expressed in the embryo surrounding region  of zea mays endosperm  <cit>  and their mrna constitutes the major proportion of the mrna in the esr region  <cit> . the best described member of the cle family is clavata  <dig>  which is presumed to be the ligand of a clv1/clv <dig> receptor complex. the receptor complex is required for limiting the number of stem cells at the shoot apical meristem  and forms the paradigm of plant lrr-rlk signaling. a variety of analyses suggest that clv <dig> is the ligand perceived by a clv1/clv <dig> receptor heterodimer  <cit> . however, direct binding of the ligand to the receptor has not yet been shown. overexpression of clv <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana hampers the initiation of organs at the sam after emergence of the first leaves. in clv <dig> loss-of-function mutants, stem cells accumulate at the centre of shoot and floral meristems, additional organs or undifferentiated tissue are formed  <cit> .

functional characterization of cle members showed them to be involved in a variety of developmental mechanisms in plants, such as the sam, the root apical meristem  or vascular cell differentiation  <cit> . the exact function of individual cle signaling peptides remains, however, largely unknown. analyses in a. thaliana showed similar phenotypes after ectopic expression of  <dig> different cle signaling peptides and resulted in the classification of cle members into four groups according to their overexpression phenotypes. this classification correlates with sequence characteristics of the conserved domain  <cit> . however, the in vivo function of the peptides might lead to more specific phenotypes, as their expression pattern in the plant might be local, and not correlate with the ectopic application of active peptides as performed in the assays.

in legumes, the formation of root nodules is triggered by nitrogen fixing bacteria generically called rhizobia  <cit> . rhizobia induce new meristems inside the legume root. this process involves at least two known lrr-rlks. at the early stages of infection, an lrr-rlk, named nork   <cit> , dmi <dig>   <cit> , symrk   <cit> , or sym <dig>   <cit>  perceives a so far unknown ligand which then activates a signaling cascade leading to nodulation. the proliferation of nodule meristems is limited by the plant. this process, so-called autoregulation of nodulation, is under control of the clv1-like lrr-rlk nark   <cit> , har <dig>   <cit> , sunn   <cit> , and sym <dig>   <cit> . in all four of these legume species, loss-of-function mutations in this protein result in an uncontrolled proliferation of nodule meristems. the regulation of nodulation is also linked to the nitrogen supply of the plant. if enough nitrogen is available in the soil, nodulation is suppressed  <cit> . interestingly, cle signaling peptides could be involved in the response of plants to nitrogen as an altered expression of cle <dig> in a. thaliana was observed under nitrogen deprivation  <cit> .

several authors suggest that a cle signaling peptide could act as ligand for the autoregulation of nodulation receptor kinase in legumes  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that cle domain proteins may play a crucial role in nodule meristem initiation and/or maintenance. so far, only seven cle members from legumes have been identified. their role remains unknown. to characterize cle domain proteins functionally and to test for an involvement in the repression of root nodule meristem formation it is necessary to identify more members from this family. because of the limited number of known cle domain proteins from legumes, we systematically surveyed cle sequences in a large number of plant sequence databases. we analyzed sequences of legumes against a background of known and new non-legume cle sequences to find out whether any legume-specific cle domain proteins could be identified.

due to their size, many small proteins, including potential signaling peptides, are frequently not detected by automated annotation programs. more refined bioinformatics approaches are therefore necessary to identify potential plant signaling peptides, either at the protein or nucleotide level  <cit> . in regards to the cle family, the majority of members were identified using psi-blast and relying on sequence similarity to known cle members  <cit> . meme/mast, a motif detection and search tool, was used to search for cle sequences in h. glycines  <cit> . several studies also used blast for the identification of a limited number of cle signaling peptides  <cit> .

RESULTS
the approach we used for the identification of cle domain proteins is analogous to the one used in the first report of the cle family  <cit> . however, our approach relied on identification of potential cle family members using a novel combination of psi-blast and hmmer  <cit> . psi-blast was used instead of blast to detect potential sequence homologues, as psi-blast combines the speed of blast with a higher sensitivity, by taking the results of former searches into account and adapting the scoring matrix for subsequent searches. this allows the scoring matrix to better reflect the protein family being analyzed and allows detection of remote members of the sequence family that simple pairwise comparison would fail to detect. hmmer, on the other hand, generates a profile hidden markov model  of a sequence family based on a multiple sequence alignment. given that a high-quality sequence alignment is used, this can provide an even better representation of the sequence family and allow more distant family members to be identified. the downside is that hmmer searches against large sequence databases are quite time consuming. to utilize the best of both approaches we used hmmaccel  <cit> , a program combining psi-blast with hmmer. psi-blast is used in a first step to reduce a large sequence database to a smaller set of sequences showing a minimal amount of sequence similarity to the protein family of interest. in this case, the reduced database consisted of those sequences generating high scoring sequence pairs up to e-values of  <dig> . this smaller set of sequences can then be searched using the slower but more exact hmm approach. thanks to an increased knowledge of cle domain proteins we could use the previously identified additional sequence characteristics, n-terminal signal sequence and c-terminal conserved domain, as further criteria for assigning motif containing protein sequences to the family.

identification of cle signaling peptides
a custom database using sequence resources from a variety of plant species was generated. we combined sequence data from genome projects for m. truncatula, oryza sativa, populus trichocarpa and a. thaliana, as well as ests from the tigr gene indices  <cit> , and tigr plant transcript assemblies  <cit>  from legume species and various plants. this yielded a database containing data from a variety of sequencing projects and incorporating a maximum of sequence information, albeit in a redundant form. we included the moss physcomitrella patens and the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to infer the evolutionary origin of the cle protein family. the primary input for the iterative search using hmmaccel consisted of a multiple sequence alignment of  <dig> of the cle sequences known at the start of the project. a sequence alignment was generated using clustalw  <cit>  and manually refined. this alignment served as input for hmmaccel, which was used to iteratively search the above mentioned plant databases with a combination of psi-blast and hmmer to detect further homologs. iteration one produced  <dig> candidates, iteration two  <dig> and iteration three  <dig>  examination of iteration three showed that many sequences were being detected that, while showing some sequence similarity to the known cle sequences, did not adequately represent the conserved  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus. this indicated our hmm having reached the limits of what could be reliably detected based solely on the sequence conservation in this family. to reduce the number of false-positives in the dataset, we analyzed the  <dig> candidate cle sequences in clans  <cit> . all sequences that did not connect to the central cluster containing the known cle sequences at a p-value threshold of 1e- <dig> were removed from the dataset. this threshold was chosen, as none of the excluded sequences contained the  <dig> amino acids of the cle motif, whereas increasing the threshold to 1e- <dig> excluded valid representatives from the dataset. having refocused the set of sequences to what we believed to be true-positive hits, the remaining  <dig> sequences were used to seed a fourth iteration of the hmmaccel search. the aim of this search was to detect all true cle representatives rather than generating a set of sequences containing only true hits and no false-positives. this final iteration also served to recover any true positive sequences we may have inadvertently discarded in the clans filtering procedure or that were missed in the third iteration due to a degeneration of the hmm. iteration four returned  <dig> sequences. the fact that less sequences were found in iteration four than in iteration three, although more sequences were used to seed the search in iteration four, points to iteration three having returned many true-positive as well as some false-positive sequences and the subsequent clans filtering having succeeded in excluding most of the false-positive hits and refocusing the search on true cle sequences. iteration four concluded our search for putative cle signaling peptide sequences.

as a control, we determined whether  <dig> recently identified members of the family, that had not been included in the initial set of  <dig> sequences, but had been present in the database, were correctly identified in iteration four. all  <dig> sequences could be found in the final dataset. starting from the initial  <dig> sequences, we also tested whether any of the sequences from previous iterations were lost in subsequent iterations, which would indicate a drift of the dataset. this was performed for the first three iterations but was not applicable for the fourth, as sequences had been manually removed from the dataset. we could not detect a noticeable drift of the dataset as, at most, three sequences were lost between successive iterations. the  <dig> cle members, serving as initial seeds for the search performed in iteration one, were consistently recovered throughout the following iterations. the only known cle sequences we were unable to detect were cle <dig>   <cit>  and cle <dig>   <cit> , as these were not present in our database. the closest homologues we could identify for cle <dig> were other known cle members with high sequence identity in the conserved cle domain. we were unable to detect any sequence showing a high degree of similarity to cle <dig> over the entire length of the protein. for cle <dig>  we were able to identify two close homologues . a multiple sequence alignment revealed that both est entries do not contain a cle motif, but are identical with cle <dig> in the remaining sequence. this indicates that the assembly of the est changed. therefore, we concluded that the sequences originally identified as cle <dig> and cle <dig> had been removed from the database version that was used for this study. all other known cle sequences were identified in the course of this iterative search.

next, we eliminated false positive candidates from the  <dig> sequences obtained in the final hmmaccel search. there is no stereotype cle member in regards to the primary protein sequence and slight variations in the sequence of the cle motif occur throughout the known family members. consequently, the tandem repeats described by strabala et al.  <cit>  and stringent criteria based on the primary sequence were set up to reliably assign candidates to the cle family. the primary characteristic of the cle family is the amino acid sequence of the conserved c-terminal region. as second criteria, protein length  and relative position of the motif in the sequence were considered. commonly, the motif is localized at the c-terminus, well within the last third of the full-length sequence. as a third criterion the isoelectric point was considered, as the vast majority of known cle sequences have a basic pi. of the  <dig> sequences, we eliminated  <dig> sequences that did not conform to the above criteria leaving  <dig> potential cle domain proteins.

many sequences were represented multiple times with varying identifiers as our custom database was generated by pooling multiple sequence databases together. to reduce the redundancy of our final set, we grouped the  <dig> sequences by sequence similarity using cd-hit  <cit> . cd-hit clusters were calculated with different thresholds ranging from 70–100% identity. to make the dataset non-redundant, sequences were sorted according to their 70% identity-threshold and all sequences assigned to the same cluster were grouped. groups containing sequences with less than 99% identity were manually validated using multalin  <cit> . this process resulted in a final set of  <dig> non-redundant sequences, which included the  <dig> known and  <dig> novel cle domain proteins .

there is confusion in the nomenclature of the family. we attempted to keep naming of the cle family members objective and consistent. similar the approach by cock and mccormick  <cit>  every member was consecutively numbered and prefixed with "cle", independent of species origin. we also assigned cle numbers to those members which had not yet been included in a systematic nomenclature .

independently, we searched a custom database containing sequences from symbiotic bacteria , pathogenic bacteria , symbiotic fungi  and a range of pathogenic fungi  to see whether any non-plant cle sequence could be detected. no cle candidate sequences could be detected in any of these species.

finally, we searched the non-redundant protein database from ncbi  using the hmm derived from the filtered results of iteration three. cle sequences returned by this search were solely from plants, with the single exception of the previously identified cle member from h. glycines  <cit> . in addition, searching the nr database did not reveal any sequences we had not previously identified using our custom plant database.

cle members with multiple and regularly arranged cle domains
a general characteristic of the cle family is that members contain a single conserved domain. surprisingly, we found five sequences  from three plant species which contained multiple cle motifs . the sequences encoding cle <dig> and cle <dig> had one entry each in the o. sativa genome, originating from two different genomic loci on chromosome  <dig>  cle <dig> had one entry in the m. truncatula genome. cle <dig> and cle <dig> from t. aestivum were identified by cock and mccormick and originate from the t. aestivum est database  <cit> . in all five cases, the conserved cle motifs within one protein sequence are very similar to one another and carry the same variations within the cle motif. cle <dig> from m. truncatula is an exception, as the third domain is different from the first two domains in the protein sequence. in all cases, the cle domains are regularly arranged, with the first domain occurring after 50– <dig> amino acids, which is typical for standard cle members, and further domains occurring at intervals of approximately  <dig> amino acids . again, cle <dig> from m. truncatula forms an exception with a larger gap between the first and the second domain. the sequences positioned in between consecutive cle motifs are similar to one another, indicating a fusion of tandem duplications of the gene or a mis-annotation of the genome or est entry.

sequence analysis
the majority of the overall protein sequence of cle members appears unrelated; sequence similarity within the family is essentially confined to a conserved domain of 12– <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus. we carried out detailed sequence analyses, firstly to search for similarity within the cle motif , and secondly to test whether there is any sequence similarity outside the cle motif. we performed cluster analyses of the conserved domains of the family using clans  <cit> . clans is a java tool to visualize and analyze protein sequence similarity based on pairwise similarity  and well suited for the analysis of large sets of sequences. clans does not allow drawing phylogenetic conclusions, it solely allows analyzing protein sequence similarity. the clustering of the sequences led to the classification of  <dig> sequences into  <dig> groups . we excluded the five cle members carrying multiple cle domains from the graph, as these complicated the visualization.  <dig> sequences, which comprise known as well as newly identified cle members, could not be reliably assigned to any of the  <dig> groups.

after clustering, we analyzed the sequence similarity of the entire protein sequence to see whether the sequences grouped by their cle motif had similar sequence regions outside the motif. we built sequence logos to visualize conserved residues within and outside the  <dig> amino acid cle motif. within the cle motif, the sequence consensus over the whole family reveals that there are six residues which are almost invariant . these include r, p, g, p, p and h, of which the first two p residues were found to be hydroxylated  <cit> . because of the central conserved position of g, we assigned g to the position zero and numbered the positions of the other amino acids relative to this g. there are two positions which have an equal probability of occurrence for n and d as well as for n and h. these conserved residues might provide a framework for the receptor interaction of the presumed ligands. some rare variations in these conserved residues occur in position  <dig>  and position + <dig> . other positions in the domain are rather variable, such as positions - <dig> and - <dig>  we were able to identify group-specific residues, i.e. residues that are responsible for the separation into distinct groups based on clans, which are highlighted in figure  <dig> 

an analysis of the protein sequence regions adjacent to the cle motif showed that, rather than being random, certain regions outside the cle motif were conserved . interestingly, these conserved motifs followed the groupings based on clans. this shows that the sequence of the primary cle motif correlates with further regions of sequence similarity, possible secondary sequence motifs, in other parts of the coding region of cle proteins.

biological function of identified cle signaling peptides in medicago truncatula
to confirm the biological activity of the in silico identified cle members we tested synthetic peptides corresponding to the conserved cle domain in a peptide assay. since the majority of cle sequences are predicted to have an effect on the growth of the ram, we used peptides that we expected to have an effect on the ram based our grouping . we synthesized two peptides, peptide  <dig>  and peptide  <dig> . the length of  <dig> amino acids was chosen, as such peptides were shown to be active in previous reports  <cit> . peptide  <dig> was only found in one cle member, cle <dig> of m. truncatula, which clustered in group  <dig> . peptide  <dig> was present in a total of eight cle sequences from various plant species cle <dig>  cle <dig>  cle <dig>  cle <dig>  cle <dig>  cle <dig>  cle <dig> and cle <dig>  due to the redundancy in the conserved domain. because the cle domain that was used for clustering included up to  <dig> amino acids, some of the latter cle sequences were grouped into different groups, including group  <dig> , group  <dig>  and one was ungrouped but located close to groups  <dig> and  <dig> . as a control, we used two peptides with individually randomized sequence  having the same amino acid composition, molecular weight and isoelectric point as peptide  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

m. truncatula seedlings were grown with the peptide as growth media additive  <cit> . a termination of root growth was clearly observable six days after treatment in all of the seedlings treated with peptides  <dig> and  <dig> compared to control plants in the absence of either peptide and compared to the randomized peptides . after six days of treatment, root growth of the plants treated with peptide  <dig> and peptide  <dig> was significantly  reduced compared to the no-peptide and the random peptide controls. after  <dig> days, almost no further root growth was observed in seedlings treated with peptide  <dig> or  <dig>  we noted an increased formation of lateral roots in both peptide treatments. similar to the ram, the newly formed meristems of the lateral roots terminated their growth shortly after lateral root emergence. we tested the reversibility of the peptide treatment by transferring half of the plants to a fresh plate not containing peptides. the ram recovered within two weeks. in some cases the main root terminated its growth, and a lateral root elongated instead. we also observed that the main root could recover its growth after release from the peptide-containing medium. in this experiment, shoot growth was not noticeably affected by the presence of peptide in the agar, although shoots were not in direct contact with the agar.

discussion
identification of cle members
the aim of this study was to identify new members of the cle signaling peptide family in plants, in particular from legumes. the overall criteria for assignment of candidates to the family were stringent and limiting, allowing us to eliminate many false positive hits. the number of redundant sequences retrieved from our custom database was much larger than the number of sequences in the final non-redundant set. this indicates that, in many cases, several redundant sequence entries from est and genome databases were combined under one cle number. that the same cle sequences were reproducibly recovered from both est and genomic data makes it highly likely that these proteins are actually expressed in the plant. however, the number of cle signaling peptides identified from plant species with a sequenced genome so far cannot be considered complete. this is because our analysis was based on the proteins predicted from the genome, which are annotated by automated open reading frame detection. this automatic detection frequently fails to detect small proteins like members of the cle family  <cit> . as such we would expect improvements in prediction of expressed proteins to, possibly, identify further cle signaling peptides. the set of sequences that we were able to identify consisted of  <dig> known and  <dig> new cle sequences bringing the number of identified potential cle signaling peptides to  <dig>  the dataset included  <dig> new legume cle sequences. sequence similarity of the cle family was analyzed not based on phylogenetic trees but on pairwise sequence comparisons. as pointed out by floyd and bowman, the restricted sequence conservation of  <dig> amino acids hampers phylogenetic analysis in case of the cle family  <cit> .

so far, we were able to identify one representative of the cle family from physcomitrella patens using the est database, although more might be found once the genome of this organism is made publicly available. from the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, of which we used the genome as well as the est database and tigr transcript assemblies, we could only identify one cle sequence, which did not cluster with any of the groups . the biological function of this putative cle signaling peptide in chlamydomonas will need to be established in future studies. it will be interesting to find out if the cle sequence of chlamydomonas has a different role to the function of cle signaling peptides in higher plants, which show cell differentiation and meristem activity, and whether cle signaling peptides are part of an essential genetic equipment required for plant development  <cit> .

a new finding was the identification of cle protein sequences carrying multiple cle motifs. we were able to detect multidomain cle proteins carrying two to six motifs from o. sativa, t. aestivum and m. truncatula, but not in any other plant species. the sequences originated from different databases and sequencing projects. to reduce the probability that mis-assembly of the genome or tc-entries is responsible for the occurance of proteins containing multiple cle-domains, we examined the genomic positions and est coverage of the proteins. using the tigr o. sativa genome browser, we determined that the motifs in cle <dig> and cle <dig> originated from a single exon. examining the tc-entries for cle <dig> and cle <dig> from t. aestivum we were able to find  <dig> individual sequence reads  for cle <dig> and five sequence reads for cle <dig> covering at least two cle motifs. this provides evidence that both of the multi-cle proteins from t. aestivum are transcribed in the predicted manner and are unlikely to be an artifact of tc-assembly. we hypothesize that the full protein sequence releases several active signaling peptides after processing, which could provide an amplification effect.

clustering of cle motifs and identification of new secondary motifs
cluster analysis of the cle sequences using clans showed that these sequences could be assigned to  <dig> groups. the grouping we observed based on sequence similarity corresponds to the classification of ectopic cle overexpression phenotypes in a. thaliana made by strabala et al. <cit> . furthermore, it is equivalent to the phylogenetic grouping and consistent with observations of effects on the root apical meristem and tissue differentiation  <cit> . we observed a close spatial arrangement of known functional orthologs in the graph   <cit> . the established grouping allows the interspecies identification of further orthologs. we hypothesize that cle <dig>  located in the same group as clv <dig> and fon <dig>  is the functional ortholog of clv <dig> in p. trichocarpa, and cle <dig> and/or cle <dig> in z. mays, respectively. the grouping also allows narrowing down the number of candidate cle genes from which the nematode h. glycines may have acquired its cle signaling peptide. the h. glycines cle sequence clustered tightly with group  <dig>  provided a lateral gene transfer occurred, this points to the nematode having acquired a cle member from group  <dig> and may allow insights as to the functions of group- <dig> cle signaling peptides as well as to the function of the h. glycines cle signaling peptides. overall, the results indicate that there is a connection between the sequence similarities leading to distinct groups of cle members and the observed effect in case of excess peptide supply   <cit> . however, as ectopic expression might lead to phenotypes that do not reflect the in vivo role of cle signaling peptides, future studies could focus on characterizing the exact biological function of each signaling peptide.

in a peptide assay we confirmed that two in silico identified signaling peptides had biological function in m. truncatula. both peptides arrested the activity of the root apical meristem and lateral root meristems, resulting in reduced root growth. the sequences of these peptides were found in cle members grouping either in group  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> . other cle peptides that clustered in these groups were also found to have a negative effect on the root apical meristem, for example cle <dig> and cle <dig> in studies in a. thaliana and zinnia elegans  <cit> . in addition, members of cle sequences in group  <dig>  including cle9–cle <dig> also showed an effect on the ram  <cit> .

one of the main questions remaining is why plants encode such a large number of lrr-rlks, and what their function and ligands are. cle signaling peptides could bind to lrr-rlks related to the clv1/clv <dig> receptor, but so far little is known about specificity between cle peptide ligands and their receptors. group specific and invariant residues as well as variations of conserved residues identified through sequence analysis could determine a selective specificity for receptor subgroups targeted by a given signaling peptide. furthermore, our cluster analysis revealed that there were regions outside the cle motif that correlated in sequence similarity with the groupings generated by clans based on the primary cle motif sequence. it has been shown that processing occurs in members of the family, meaning that one or a complex of enzymes recognize part of the protein sequence and cleave it. the addition of a single arginine residue at the c-terminus of the conserved domain results in a decrease of peptide activity  <cit> . this shows that correct cleavage and specific recognition of the conserved domain are required for the maximum activity of the signaling peptide. the process and detailed mechanism remain unknown. furthermore, it is unclear whether all peptides are processed and modified in a manner equivalent to clv <dig> and tdif, which were found to be active as  <dig> amino acid peptides. we hypothesize that the extensions of the motif may be involved in the specific recognition and processing of the signaling peptide precursor.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> new cle domain proteins from a variety of plant species, including  <dig> new sequences from legumes, which could be potential ligands for the lrr-rlks controlling nodulation. we also found several cle proteins with multiple cle domains, which could represent a mechanism for peptide signal amplification. clustering of the sequences showed  <dig> distinct groups, which were found to have conserved secondary motifs outside the cle domain. biological activity of two of the predicted signaling peptides were confirmed in vivo. cle signaling peptides could have potential biotechnological applications for altering plant development, as exemplified in us patent no.  <dig> using cle signalling peptide functions in z. mays. while we could not test the biological activity of all the identified signaling peptides in our study, we hope that the cle domain proteins presented in this study will allow other researchers to test their function in a variety of plant species and as potential ligands of lrr-rlks.
