BACKGROUND
escherichia coli of serogroup o <dig> may be isolated both in intestinal and extraintestinal sites, although they have been only sporadically described in the latter  <cit> . on the other hand, intestinal e. coli strains have been more frequently identified as belonging to this serogroup. intestinal o <dig> e. coli strains have been isolated from animals and humans and have been classified as both enterotoxigenic  and attaching and effacing  e. coli, the latter including both enterohemorrhagic  and enteropathogenic  e. coli  <cit> . serogroup o <dig> is particularly important among porcine epec  strains which cause post-weaning diarrhea  characterized by specific attaching and effacing  lesions  <cit> ). most o <dig> pepec strains possess the locus of enterocyte effacement  pathogenicity island, which contains virulence genes necessary for the production of a/e lesions. they also often possess the paa gene , which encodes a virulence factor involved in the a/e phenotype and is thought to contribute to the early stages of pepec pathogenicity  <cit> . these strains also have the ability to produce a/e lesions in experimentally inoculated newborn gnotobiotic piglets and in a homologous in vitro model using newborn piglet ileal explants, as well as to adhere to pk <dig> porcine kidney cells in vitro  <cit> .

genomic islands  such as lee are regions of bacterial genomes that have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer and often contain blocks of genes that function together in specific processes. when the genomes of the two e. coli o157:h <dig> strains edl <dig> and sakai were compared with that of e. coli k <dig> strain mg <dig>  the gis found to be present in strains edl <dig> and sakai but absent in strain mg <dig> were named o-islands  and sakai loops , respectively. the gis found to be present in e. coli k <dig> but absent from the two e. coli o157:h <dig> strains were named k-islands  and k-loops, respectively  <cit> . gis related to the virulence of a pathogen are also referred to as pathogenicity islands   <cit> . in e. coli o157:h <dig> strain edl <dig>  several large ois encode virulence or putative virulence factors. these ois include oi# <dig>  and oi# <dig>  for shiga toxin  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, oi# <dig>  for lee, and oi# <dig>  for paa  <cit> .

a recent microarray-based study has catalogued genomic alterations in a collection of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, particularly in gis, suggesting the existence of two dominant lineages, with characteristics that are unique to each of them  <cit> . previous studies performed on various aeec strains have also shown that, depending on their pathotype and host specificity, strains can show variations in their lee sequences as well as in the site of insertion of lee in the chromosome  <cit> . the purpose of the present study was to examine the genotypic differences, particularly in lee sequences and chromosomal insertion sites, and in the presence or absence of non lee-encoded virulence factors, such as paa, among a collection of o <dig> pepec strains which have been previously shown to induce a/e lesions in pigs. in this study, we have characterized o <dig> pepec strains using a dna-microarray designed specifically for detection of e. coli virulence genes  <cit>  and compared their genomes using comparative genomic hybridization  and pcr. we identified two distinct groups of pepec o <dig> strains, between which there were significant variations in gi content.

methods
bacterial strains and preparation of genomic dna
nine o <dig> pepec strains, which were isolated at the faculté de médecine vétérinaire, saint-hyacinthe, québec, canada, from pigs with pwd  <cit>  were used for the microarray studies . these strains were selected based, i) on their ability to produce or not a/e lesions in challenged pigs  <cit>  and in an homologous ex vivo model using newborn piglet ileal explants , ii) and on the severity of the a/e manifestation they produced  <cit>  . because of its genetic and phenotypic similarities with the o <dig> pepec strains  <cit> , the o <dig> rabbit epec  strain e <dig>  provided by eric oswald   <cit> , was included in the study. five e. coli reference strains were used as controls in pcr experiments: the two o157:h <dig> e. coli strains edl <dig> and sakai, the k <dig> strain mg <dig>  the uropathogenic  strain cft <dig> and the repec strain rdec- <dig>

h strain ecl <dig> produced a/e lesions in explants but was not included in the study by zhu et al.  <cit> .

for dna preparations, strains were grown overnight in  <dig> ml of brain-heart-infusion  broth at 37°c. the cultures were centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> minutes and the pellet was dissolved in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> μg/ml proteinase k and  <dig> % sds. this suspension was incubated at 50°c for  <dig> h and dna was extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol . following centrifugation for  <dig> min at  <dig> rpm, the upper phase was removed and precipitated by adding  <dig>  volume of  <dig> m naoac  and  <dig> volumes of 99% ethanol. the dna precipitate was then spooled out of the solution using a sterile glass rod, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in  <dig> ml of te  buffer.

e. coli dna microarrays
for the whole genome microarray , corning ultra-gap ii slides  were spotted with the mwg e. coli o157:h <dig> array set . the mwg array set consists of  <dig> 50-mer oligonucleotides covering the whole genomes of e. coli k- <dig> strain mg <dig>  <cit>  and e. coli o157:h <dig> strains sakai   <cit>  and edl <dig>   <cit> .

the e. coli virulence microarray used in this study was derived from the one previously developed by bruant et al. and included  <dig> 70-mer oligonucleotides specific for  <dig> e. coli virulence or putative virulence genes or markers found in various intestinal and extraintestinal e. coli strains of all known pathotypes  <cit> . probes were specific for genes encoding adhesins; toxins; bacteriocins; anti-aggregative factors; autotransporters; capsular, flagellar, and somatic antigens; hemolysins; invasins; iron acquisition systems or transport proteins; and outer membrane proteins, as well as other genes recently shown to be associated with virulence in e. coli. this microarray also detected genetic variants of particular genes, such as the intimin-encoding gene eae , espa , espb , and tir  from the lee. oligonucleotides specific for three variants of the major fimbrial subunit of the long polar fimbria -encoding gene lpfa were also included. these were based on sequences from the lpfa genes of epec strains of serogroup o <dig> , oi# <dig> from e. coli of serotype o157:h <dig> , and repec strains and e. coli of serogroup o <dig> .

microarray hybridizations
prior to e. coli o157:h <dig> microarray hybridization, each array was pre-hybridized at 50°c in a solution of  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds and  <dig> % bsa for  <dig> h. following this step, arrays were washed completely in dh2o, rinsed with isopropanol, and then centrifuged and dried. for hybridization,  <dig> μg of test genomic dna were digested with ecorv and psti restriction enzymes,  <dig> μg of which were labeled with ulysis alexa fluor  <dig> dye . genomic dna from strains mg <dig>  sakai and edl <dig> was digested in an analogous fashion, and  <dig> μg of the preparation from each strain was combined and labeled with alexa fluor  <dig> dye . this labeled genomic dna mixture was then used as a reference for all hybridizations. unincorporated dye was removed using qiaquick pcr purification kits , according to the manufacturer's instructions, and dna was eluted in  <dig> μl of  <dig>  × te buffer. labeled dna was vacuum-dried and resuspended in  <dig> μl of dh2o. a  <dig> μl hybridization solution consisting of 30% formamide,  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds,  <dig>  mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm dna, and equal amounts of test and reference labeled dnas, each containing at least  <dig> pmol of incorporated dye, was denatured at 95°c for  <dig> min and briefly centrifuged to collect all the contents. dna preparations were then hybridized overnight  at 42°c. after hybridization, arrays were washed according to the modified corning method . arrays were then scanned with a genepix 4000b scanner  and processed using genepix pro  <dig> . two slides were hybridized per strain with a dye-swap repeat per slide.

hybridizations on e. coli virulence microarrays were performed as described previously  <cit> . arrays were scanned with a scanarray® lite fluorescent microarray analysis system  and acquisition and quantification of fluorescent spot intensities were performed using the scanarray express® software version  <dig>  .

microarray data analysis
data obtained from e. coli o157:h <dig> microarrays were normalized using the ratio-based and lowess methods in acuity  <dig>   before analysis. the normalized data for all strains were converted into log <dig>  in acuity  <dig>  and subsequently analyzed in microsoft excel. control, blank, and test spots with a mean intensity below that of the mean of all negative controls were removed from the analysis. the arithmetic mean of the remaining spots across the four duplicates was calculated to construct the dataset. gack   <cit> , was used to generate a cut-off value determining the presence or absence of genes, and a dendrogam using the euclidean distance metric with average linkage was created with tmev v <dig>   <cit> .

for the data obtained from e. coli virulence microarrays, the local background was subtracted from the recorded spot intensities. the median value of each set of triplicate spotted oligonucleotides was then compared to the median value of the negative control spots present on the array. oligonucleotides with a signal-to-noise fluorescence ratio greater than  <dig>  were considered as positive.

microarray data accession number
the microarray data have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  .

pcr experiments
pcr experiments were performed for the nine o <dig> pepec strains and the repec strain e <dig> to determine the localization in their chromosome of the lee and of the oi# <dig>  as well as the integrity of the oi# <dig> and of the secondary type iii secretion system gene cluster designated ett <dig> . all pcr experiments were performed as described in previous studies carried out on the lee, oi# <dig> and ett <dig> gene clusters .

pcr experiments were also performed for nlea and nlec genes. the pairs of primers used were nlea-f  – nlea-r  and ecs1812f  – ecs1812r  for nlea, and nlec-f  – nlec-r  and ecs0847f  – ecs0847r  for nlec. the conditions for amplifications were an initial denaturation of 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s; 55°c for  <dig> s; 72°c for  <dig> s and a final elongation of 72°c for  <dig> min.

RESULTS
characterization of o <dig> pepec strains using the e. coli virulence microarray
all o <dig> pepec strains and the repec strain e <dig> were characterized using the e. coli virulence microarray described previously, which includes probes targeting virulence genes generally found in aeec but also virulence genes from the other e. coli virotypes  <cit> . all strains possessed their own specific virulence gene profile but were all classified as atypical epec . they all possessed the lee genes and shared the same lee profile: eae – espa group i – espb group iii – tir group i. in addition, each strain lacked the shiga toxin  <dig> encoding genes stx2a and stx2b, as well as the bundle forming pili  encoding gene bfpa and the e. coli adherence factor  virulence plasmid marker eaf. remarkably, all o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig>  although stx1a-negative, gave a positive hybridization for the stx1b gene, which encodes the b subunit of ehec shiga-like toxin  <dig> and which is generally absent in epec strains. however, the presence of the stx1b gene was not confirmed in pcr experiments .

the e. coli strains could be classified into two distinct groups according to their virulence gene pattern . group i included the four pepec strains ecl <dig>  ecl <dig>  ecl <dig>  and ecl <dig>  and repec strain e <dig>  group ii included the five other pepec strains ecl <dig>  ecl <dig>  ecl <dig>  ecl <dig>  and ecl <dig>  results obtained with the e. coli virulence microarray identified  <dig> virulence genes that showed a non-random distribution between group i and group ii strains . genes b <dig> , set , tspe <dig> c <dig> , efa <dig> , and paa were present in all group i strains, including repec strain e <dig>  but absent from all group ii strains. the temperature sensitive hemagglutinin encoding gene tsh, the yersiniabactin-related genes fyua, irp <dig> and irp <dig>  as well as the pai-associated gene malx were present in all o <dig> pepec strains from group i but in neither repec strain e <dig> nor group ii strains. the heat-stable enterotoxin encoding gene asta was present in all o <dig> pepec group i strains and in group ii strain ecl <dig> but absent from all other group ii strains and repec strain e <dig> 

the genes aidai , chua , ecs <dig> , rtx , and yjaa  were present in all group ii strains but absent from group i strains, including repec strain e <dig>  the gene fepc  was present in three group ii strains  but absent from all other strains.

in addition, group i and group ii strains possessed different variants of the flic  and lpfa genes. o <dig> pepec strains from group i, including repec strain e <dig>  possessed the flic variant flma <dig>  whereas group ii strains possessed the flic gene. group i strains also possessed the lpfao <dig> and lpfar <dig> variants, whereas repec strain e <dig> only possessed the lpfar <dig> variant, and group ii strains possessed the lpfa <dig> variant.

previous phylogenetic analyses have shown that most e. coli strains belonged to the four main phylogenetic groups a, b <dig>  b <dig>  and d. whereas extraintestinal e. coli strains belong mainly to groups b <dig> and d, most commensal and diarrheogenic strains belong to group a and group b <dig>  <cit> . determination of the phylogenetic groups of the o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> was based on the presence or absence of the two genes chua and yjaa, and the dna fragment tspe <dig> c <dig>  as described by clermont et al.  <cit> . all group i strains including repec strain e <dig> were classified in phylogenetic group b <dig> and all group ii strains were classified in phylogenetic group b <dig> 

cgh-genomotyping of pepec strains
the cgh-based genomotyping analysis of the nine o <dig> pepec strains and the repec strain e <dig> led to their classification into two distinct groups in the same distribution as observed by the e. coli virulence microarray. a dendrogram based on the analysis of the cgh data for o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig>  as well as for the two o157:h <dig> strains sakai and edl <dig> is presented in figure  <dig>  the distribution of gis in o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> was investigated by analysis of the cgh data. since the microarray used for cgh was not an epec-specific microarray and was composed of oligonucleotide probes specific for genome sequences of o157:h <dig> ehec and k <dig> strains, it was not possible to investigate all the gis in o <dig> pepec strains. the divergences in gis observed by cgh could thus indicate either the absence of particular genes or the presence of different variants of these genes. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> gis  were found to be significantly different between group i and group ii strains. among these  <dig> gis,  <dig> were kis or k-loops and  <dig> were ois or s-loops. twenty gis were present in group i strains but absent in group ii strains, including oi# <dig> , which contains the paa gene, and the two virulence related gis, oi# <dig>   <cit>  and oi# <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand,  <dig> gis were absent in group i strains but present in group ii strains, including oi# <dig> , oi# <dig>  and oi# <dig> , which contain fimbriae related genes. ki# <dig> , which was absent in all group ii strains, was present in the four o <dig> pepec strains from group i but not in repec strain e <dig>  interestingly, for seven gis, more than half of the orfs in each island were present in all group i strains whereas these gis were absent in all group ii strains. conversely, for two gis, more than half of the orfs in each island were present in group ii strains whereas these gis were absent in group i strains.

a +/- indicates that more than 50% of the orfs in this island or loop are present.

b repec strain e <dig> is "-".

in addition to the  <dig> gis found to be significantly different between group i and group ii strains,  <dig> other gis were conserved in both groups . eight of these gis were kis or k-loops and  <dig> were ois or s-loops.

finally, analysis of the e. coli o157:h <dig> microarray data indicated that the shiga toxin encoding genes stx <dig> and stx <dig> could not be detected in any of the o <dig> pepec strains or in the repec strain e <dig>  and that similarly, all strains were lacking both the tccp  and tccp <dig>  genes, which encode e. coli o157:h <dig> type iii effector proteins that couple the intimin receptor tir to the actin-cytoskeleton, and trigger actin polymerization  <cit> .

analysis of lee by the e. coli o157:h <dig> microarray
thirty of the  <dig> genes on lee  were found to be conserved among the o <dig> pepec strains, repec strain e <dig>  and the two o157:h <dig> strains edl <dig> and sakai . these included the effector-encoding genes espa, espf and espg, the regulator ler, and most of the genes of the type iii secretion pathway such as sepl, escd, cest, escn, escv, sepd, escc, cesd, escu, esct, escs, and escr. for the  <dig> remaining genes on lee, no hybridization was observed in the o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig>  possibly reflecting genetic divergences between these strains and the o157:h <dig> representative strains edl <dig> and sakai. these genes were the effector-encoding genes espb, espd, and esph, intimin and the translocated intimin receptor-encoding genes eae and tir, the genes of the type iii secretion pathway sepq, sepz, and escj, and the genes map, mpc  and z <dig>

c +, gene present; -, gene absent.

localization of lee and oi#122
the lee of aeec strains is often inserted in the vicinity of the trna loci selc or pheu. since it has been previously reported that the site of insertion of lee in pepec strains could be either in selc or in pheu  <cit> , the o <dig> pepec strains in our study and repec strain e <dig> were examined by pcr using primers specific for these two genes and for lee extremities . the lee was found to be inserted into the trna pheu locus in all examined strains. remarkably, an amplicon of  <dig> bp longer than the expected size was also obtained with primers specific for lee extremities and selc for strains ecl <dig> and ecl <dig> .

similarly, the localization and integrity of oi# <dig> was determined by pcr using primers described previously . all group i strains possessed this gi and were positive for the four genes tested; efa <dig>  ent, nleb, and nlee, with the latter two encoding non-lee virulence factors. oi# <dig> was found to be inserted into the trna pheu locus in strain ecl <dig> and into the trna phev locus in strains ecl <dig> and ecl <dig>  the site of insertion of this gi was not determined for strain ecl <dig> or for repec strain e <dig>  all group ii strains lacked oi# <dig> .

nle genes in o <dig> pepec strains
the e. coli o157:h <dig> microarray used in our cgh studies contains oligonucleotide probes specific for genes encoding non-lee factors which have previously been associated with the pathogenicity of aeec strains  <cit> . the nlea and nlec genes were present in all o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> as determined by the o157:h <dig> microarray . nevertheless, pcr analysis using two different primer sets for each gene  revealed amplicons of various sizes in the different strains, showing that the nlea and nlec genes in group i were different from those in group ii .

b pcrs using two different primer sets for each gene revealed that both nlea and nlec in group i were different from those in group ii.

sixteen other nle genes showed non-random distributions between group i and group ii strains . the five genes espy <dig>  espx <dig>  espr <dig>  espl3' , and espl3'  were absent in all group i strains but present in group ii strains. on the other hand, the five genes espx <dig>  espk, espl <dig>  nleb <dig>  and nlee were present in all group i strains but absent in group ii strains. the four genes nleg2-1', espo1- <dig>  nleg, and nleg9' were present in all group i strains with the exception of repec strain e <dig>  and absent in group ii strains. the gene nleb2- <dig> was present in all group ii strains and also in repec strain e <dig> but absent in the other group i strains. the gene nled was present in only two group i strains, ecl <dig> and ecl <dig>  and absent in all the other strains, including repec strain e <dig> 

two additional nle genes, nlef and nleh, were present in all o <dig> pepec strains. nleh, but not nlef, was also present in repec strain e <dig> .

distribution of ett <dig> genes
oi# <dig>  initially described in e. coli of serotype o157:h <dig> and present in other epec and ehec strains from animals and humans, contains the secondary type iii secretion system gene cluster ett <dig>  <cit> . cgh data analysis revealed that all group ii strains had the entire ett <dig> locus comprising  <dig> genes, with the exception of strain ecl <dig>  which lacked most of this gi .

in contrast, group i strains possessed only a partially intact locus and the occurrence of the ett <dig> genes was highly variable. among the  <dig> ett <dig> genes, strain ecl <dig> possessed only  <dig>  strain ecl <dig> possessed  <dig>  strain ecl <dig> possessed  <dig>  and strain ecl <dig> possessed  <dig>  finally, repec strain e <dig> possessed  <dig> genes of this gi. these results were confirmed by pcr as described previously  <cit> , with primers specific for different regions of the ett <dig> gene cluster .

genes required for intestinal colonization in the bovine
previous studies have identified several genes required for ehec intestinal colonization of the bovine  <cit> . microarray analysis in our study revealed that  <dig> genes associated with colonization of either e. coli o157:h <dig> or e. coli o26:h- in the bovine were associated with either group i or group ii strains . seven genes were present in group i but not in group ii strains, with the exception of repec strain e <dig> which did not possess the gene z <dig> . in contrast, six other genes were present in group ii but not in group i strains, with the exception of repec strain e <dig> which possessed the gene z <dig> . these results were confirmed by pcr using primers designed for each gene .

discussion
in this study, we investigated the genetic relationships among pepec strains of serogroup o <dig> and catalogued genomic alterations unique to these strains by using both a virulence gene-specific microarray and a whole genome microarray. the  <dig> pepec strains in this study have been previously characterized for their capacity to induce a/e lesions in both explants and challenged pigs, and were grouped according to the severity of the a/e manifestation they produced  <cit> . based on their virulence gene content as determined by the e. coli virulence microarray, o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> displayed significant differences from typical epec and could be regarded as atypical epec, that are defined as lee-positive e. coli lacking stx <dig> and stx <dig> genes, as well as the eaf virulence plasmid which encodes the epec adhesin bfp  <cit> . in addition, all o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> unexpectedly hybridized with the stxb <dig> probe of the e. coli virulence microarray, as was also observed for some atypical epec strains isolated from children with diarrhea in a recent study in norway  <cit> . due to the absence of hybridization with the corresponding stxa <dig> probe and the negative pcr results obtained with stxb <dig> sequence specific primers  <cit> , we therefore concluded that the gene sequences detected by the stxb <dig> hybridization probe did not represent a complete stxb gene but rather a possible truncated form of this gene.

as observed for other atypical epec strains, o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> also displayed a relatively high heterogeneity in their virulence gene profiles  <cit> . based on their virulence gene content, they could be divided into two distinct groups, groups i and ii. it has been argued that atypical epec strains could have arisen from e. coli strains of different pathotypes which acquired the lee by horizontal gene transfer or from certain typical epec strains that have lost the eaf plasmid  <cit> . trabulsi et al. have also observed that some atypical epec strains are genetically closer to ehec strains of serotype o157:h <dig> than to typical epec  <cit> . several virulence genes showed a non-random distribution between group i and group ii strains. group i strains thus possessed several virulence-related genes which were absent in group ii strains. group i-specific genes included paa  and oi# <dig> genes efa <dig>  and set . genes associated with other pathotypes were also found. the gene tsh, encoding a hemagglutinin which may be a virulence factor of avian extraintestinal e. coli  <cit> , the pathogenicity island marker malx, related to virulence in extraintestinal e. coli  <cit>  and the yersiniabactin-related genes fyua, irp <dig> and irp <dig>  implicated in the ferric uptake system, were also group i-specific. in contrast, group ii strains possessed only a few additional virulence-related genes when compared with group i strains. these included aidai, which encodes a protein involved in the adherence of epec  <cit> , and iron uptake-related genes chua and fepc. finally, group i and group ii strains also possessed different variants of the long polar fimbriae encoding gene lpfa. a recent study has shown that the lpfao <dig> variant, found in group i strains in our study, was found significantly more frequently in atypical epec strains associated with cases of diarrhea than in strains isolated from healthy individuals  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that analysis by cgh using a whole genome e. coli microarray, representing two lineage i, human outbreak-related e. coli o157:h <dig> strains and one non-pathogenic e. coli k <dig> strain, resulted in the distribution of the o <dig> pepec strains into the same two groups , observed for the e. coli virulence microarray. this genetic-based grouping, principally reflecting the virulence gene content of the strains, was also compatible with the grouping based on their a/e activity  <cit> . the o <dig> pepec strains of group i all induced severe a/e lesions whereas those of group ii induced less severe or no a/e lesions in both pig ileal explants and challenged pigs. repec strain e <dig> was placed into group i but was genetically distant from the four o <dig> pepec strains belonging to this group. these strains showed a relatively high level of heterogeneity in their virulence gene profiles.

in addition to the variations in particular virulence genes, significant variations in gis were also observed between group i and ii strains. we observed that several virulence-related ois were present only in group i strains. these included oi# <dig> , which contains the paa gene; oi# <dig> , which contains the non-lee encoded factor gene nlea, previously shown to be associated with the pathogenicity of aeec strains  <cit> ; and oi# <dig> which contains the two non-lee encoded factor genes nleb and nlee and virulence genes efa <dig> and set. interestingly, these ois have also been shown to be more prevalent in stec strains associated with outbreaks and severe disease  <cit> . on the other hand, certain ois were only present in group ii strains. these include oi# <dig> , containing genes encoding putative fimbrial chaperone proteins; oi# <dig> , containing a fimbrial operon and genes encoding several additional putative virulence factors in e. coli of serogroup o <dig>  <cit> ; and oi# <dig> , containing genes encoding putative type  <dig> fimbrial proteins. finally, oi# <dig> was highly divergent between group i and group ii strains. this oi contains the secondary type iii secretion system gene cluster ett <dig>  which resembles the spi-1-encoded type iii secretion system from salmonella enterica and has been previously characterized in o157:h <dig> e. coli strains  <cit> . it has been recently shown that ett <dig> influences the secretion of proteins encoded by the lee and also modulates adhesion to human intestinal cells  <cit> . most group ii strains  possessed the entire ett <dig>  however, group ii strain ecl <dig> lacked most of the entire cluster  and was one of the two strains which did not induce a/e lesions in explants or in challenged pigs. group i strains, including repec strain e <dig>  have only a partial ett <dig> gene cluster, possessing from  <dig> to  <dig> genes of the  <dig> in the intact cluster. the substantial variations observed for this cluster are consistent with the findings of previous studies, that while the ett <dig> gene cluster was present in most of the e. coli strains tested, it contained numerous inactivating mutations  <cit> .

in contrast to the heterogeneity of their virulence gene content and gi distribution, o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> showed a high level of homogeneity in their lee sequences and site of insertion. in all strains, the lee was inserted into the trna pheu gene and no significant divergence between group i and group ii strains was observed for the lee genes. in addition, all o <dig> pepec strains and repec strain e <dig> shared the same profile for the intimin encoding gene eae, its translocated receptor tir and the effector encoding genes espa and espb, as shown by the e. coli virulence microarray. all strains possessed the beta variant of the intimin encoding gene, being the most widespread among the intestinal epec strains of different animal species  <cit> . however, group i and group ii strains from our study all belonged to the phylogenetic groups b <dig> and b <dig> whereas ishii et al. have shown that most epec strains possessing the intimin subtype beta belong to phylogenetic groups a and b <dig>  <cit> .

finally, we have also observed numerous disparities in the distribution of non-lee encoded genes. several nle genes were only present in group i strains whereas others were only found in group ii strains. in addition, group i and group ii strains possessed two different variants of the genes nlea and nlec. this variation in the distribution of nle genes may influence the pathogenicity of the strains and the type of a/e lesions they produce, since many studies have shown the importance of non-lee encoded factors in the a/e phenotype  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have genetically characterized a collection of o <dig> pepec strains using e. coli o157-e. coli k <dig> whole genome and virulence gene-specific e. coli microarrays. we have shown that the strains, although showing some heterogeneity, could be classified into two groups, based on their virulence gene and gi content. these differences in their virulence gene content may influence the pathogenicity of o <dig> pepec strains, and explain why group i o <dig> pepec strains induced more severe a/e lesions in explants and challenged pigs than group ii strains  <cit> .
