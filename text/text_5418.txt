BACKGROUND
the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  is a complex retrovirus, which encodes the enzyme reverse transcriptase , and exhibits high mutation rates due to the lack of the dna proofreading activity of the viral rt. hiv- <dig> genome is diploid, containing two plus-strand viral rna copies that can be identical. in the process of viral dna synthesis, template switching occurs by translocation of rt between two genomic rnas, and results in both intra-molecular and inter-molecular recombination. if dual infections or superinfection with different strains or subtypes of hiv- <dig> occurs, two different rna templates might be co-packaged into one virion, yielding a heterozygous virion. in a subsequent infection cycle, rt may switch from one template  to the other , producing a mosaic hiv- <dig> genome  <cit> . hiv- <dig> has high potential to form recombination variants  <cit> . the high rate of recombination is due to the frequent template switching of rt. at least  <dig>  template switching events occur per genome per replication cycle was estimated previously  <cit> . genetic recombination and point mutation are both important strategies to increase viral diversity, which allow hiv- <dig> to escape immune attack and to develop possibly drug-resistant variants  <cit> .

retroviral recombination generally occurs during minus-strand dna synthesis  <cit> . the "dock and lock" model had been proposed to shed light on the mechanism of retroviral recombination. this model suggested that rt switches templates when it encounters palindrome  structures that can induce rt to pause. rt pausing during synthesis can enhance strand transfer  <cit> . rna secondary structures play an important role in the function of an rna molecule, such as rna-protein interactions, transcription, translation, and so on. previous studies in vitro have indicated that specific rna secondary structures were associated with strand transfer by favoring rt pausing  <cit> . however, it remains uncertain whether rna secondary structure is involved in the generation of circulating hiv- <dig> recombinants.

currently, some hiv- <dig> recombination variants have been identified worldwide  <cit> . sixteen prevalent inter-subtype recombinants were recognized as circulating recombinant forms  from  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . three crfs, crf01_ae, crf07_bc and crf08_bc were found in china. of them, crf07_bc and crf08_bc possibly arose in yunnan province, and had circulated widely among injecting drug users   <cit> . in addition, the unique recombinant forms , between subtypes b'  and c, are epidemic among idus in dehong prefecture in western yunnan, suggesting on-going generation of new hiv- <dig> intersubtype recombinants  <cit> . most hiv- <dig> infected idus in china were unemployed, and never received any antiretroviral therapy due to lack of income  <cit> . therefore, there is no drug selective pressure associated with generation of recombinants in china, and these recombinants represent the occurrence of natural recombination.

the stem-loop structure is the most important secondary structure of rna. a method to estimate the potential to form stem-loop structure by calculating fors-d has been used to investigate the relationship between secondary structure and evolutionary pressure  <cit> . previous studies by forsdyke showed that gene regions under strong positive "darwinian" selection were associated with positive fors-d values, reflecting the conflict between stem-loop structure potential and specific protein function  <cit> . in addition, our previous work found that the fors-d values correlated negatively with ccr <dig> gene deletions, indicating that stem-loop structure influences the deletion  <cit> . these suggested that stem-loop structures might play an important role in mutation strategies and gene evolution. therefore, in the present study, we selected china crfs and urfs as a means to investigate the relationship between the secondary structure and natural recombination by analyzing the fors-d values of hiv- <dig> genome.

RESULTS
the distribution of fors-d values in hiv subtype b' and c genomes
previous studies have analyzed the local secondary structural information of some hiv- <dig> strains by calculating the "statistically significant" stem-loop potential, and found that different regions of hiv- <dig> genome had different potential to form stem-loop structures  <cit> . the regions with high stem-loop potential were generally associated with the interaction between local secondary structures and corresponding protein factors. for example, trans-acting responsive element  and rev-responsive element , both of which are recognized by the tat protein and rev protein respectively, have more stable local secondary structures than other regions of hiv- <dig> genome  <cit> . a negative correlation between "statistically significant" stem-loop potential and sequence variability  was observed in the hiv- <dig> genome. in the regions with higher negative fors-d values, indicating that base order favors stem-loop potential, the rate of base substitutions tend to be lower. contrarily, higher positive fors-d values decrease stem-loop potential and is functionally important, because the rate of base substitutions increases  <cit> .

genetic recombination is another important pathway to generate variability for hiv- <dig>  previous studies found that local stem-loop structure enhanced the occurrence of template switching of rt  <cit> . to assess whether local stem-loop structure is involved in the generation of natural hiv- <dig> recombination, fors-d analysis was applied to estimate the potential of hiv- <dig> sequences to form stem-loop structures. the fors-d value represents a base order-determined stem-loop potential, and provides a measure of the contribution of base order alone to the formation of stem-loop structure  <cit> . the fons value determines the trend of total stem-loop potential.

yunnan province of china has a high hiv- <dig> prevalence among idus and generates multiple forms of hiv- <dig> intersubtype recombinants  <cit> . because most hiv- <dig> infected idus are unemployed, they almost never receive any antiretroviral therapy  <cit> . therefore, the recombinant forms circulated among idus indicate the occurrence of the natural recombination between hiv- <dig> subtypes b' and c without drug selective pressure. to investigate the relationship between local stem-loop potential and natural recombination, two closely related hiv- <dig> strains, 95in <dig> and rl <dig>  which are known to be parent strains of china inter-subtype b' and c recombinants, were selected as objectives to analyze fors-d.

fons and fors-m values found in rl <dig> and 95in <dig> are shown in part a and b of figure  <dig>  respectively. both hiv- <dig> strains appeared to have similar trends in fons and fors-m values. fors-m values were relatively constant . however, a large fluctuation was observed with fons values. several higher negative fons values appeared in 5' and 3' termini, 3' end of the gag gene, and around nucleotide  <dig> in the env gene. these results were consistent with the previous observations in other hiv- <dig> strains  <cit> . figure 1c shows fors-d values for both 95in <dig> and rl <dig>  except for a few regions, hiv- <dig> subtype b' and c genomes appeared to have similar distribution of fors-d values. the windows with higher negative fons values accordingly appeared to have higher negative fors-d values. the fluctuations of fons values observed in the whole genome of the both hiv- <dig> subtypes were largely base-order dependent, as reflected in the fors-d values . the highest negative fors-d values of both sequences occurred around nucleotide  <dig> in rre region .

for each hiv- <dig> subtype, the distribution of fors-d values differed in different regions of the gene. the apparent higher negative fors-d value region occurred in the gag gene and at the 5' end of the pol gene  . however, an intense fluctuation of positive and negative fors-d values around the abscissa was observed in the region from the 3' part of pol gene to env gene . this region encodes rt, integrase, envelope glycoproteins gp <dig> and gp <dig>  other important regulatory  and accessory  proteins. they determine hiv- <dig> replication and efficient infection, and are exposed immediately to the human immune system and under strong positive "darwinian" selection  <cit> . previous studies on retroviral genes  <cit> , mhc genes  <cit> , snake venom phospholipase a <dig>  <cit>  and other genes  <cit> , had showed that a region under strong positive selection exhibited generally positive fors-d values. our results supported the observation that fors-d value was associated with evolutionary pressure  <cit> .

the relationship between the hiv- <dig> b'/c intersubtype recombination and stem-loop potential
in vitro studies using the hiv- <dig> derived vector system indicated that hiv- <dig> genome has high rate of recombination and hot spots for recombination occurrence  <cit> . the hot spots were located in stable hairpin structures  <cit> . however, the previous observation did not indicate whether the occurrence of hiv- <dig> crfs and urfs in worldwide distribution correlates with secondary structures of rna templates due to sequence difference between vector and circulated strains. to assess whether stem-loop structures are involved in occurrence of natural recombination, we selected subtype b' rl <dig> and subtype c 95in <dig>  both of which represent the parent strains of existing crfs and urfs in china, to carry out fors-d analysis. currently, besides crf <dig> and  <dig>  only two other full-length sequences of urfs circulated in china are available. these four existing recombinants, representing four different recombination variants, were selected and analyzed using the simplot software. their mosaic patterns are shown in fig. 1d. the breakpoints of recombination are identified in the fors-d distribution of rl <dig> and 95in <dig>  by fine vertical dashed lines. in addition to these four full-length sequences, other urfs were also analyzed despite the availability of only gag-rt region   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows their partial mosaic map and fors-d distribution in breakpoints.

in total,  <dig> different inserted recombined fragments were identified in china hiv- <dig> b'/c intersubtype recombinants   <cit> . thirteen  of these mosaic fragments occurred in the higher negative fors-d value region  of parent genomes, where the gag gene and 5' end of the pol gene are located. on the other hand, because several shared breakpoints were observed in these mosaic molecules, which were confirmed by our previous reports  <cit> ,  <dig> mosaic fragments only contained  <dig> unique breakpoints. for example, fragment  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shared the 3' end breakpoint. among these breakpoints,  <dig>  also located in this higher negative fors-d value region. this strongly indicates that natural recombination did not occur randomly throughout the hiv genome, and that there might be preferred  regions or sites for recombination  <cit> . these observations suggest an association between recombination and high negative fors-d values .

in order to further confirm the relationship between recombination and high negative fors-d values, fors-d values of corresponding breakpoints of parent sequences were calculated as described in the methods. the fors-d values of breakpoints of  <dig> fragments were shown in table  <dig>  for most fragments, at least one breakpoint of each fragment was found to be located in regions with higher negative fors-d values. two exceptions were fragment  <dig> and  <dig>  they had at least one breakpoint located in the regions of higher negative fors-d values in one parent subtype, and at least one breakpoint located in the regions of negative fors-d values  in another parent subtype . twenty-one breakpoints appeared to more favor occurring in higher negative fors-d values region , and negative fors-d values region . in addition, the average fors-d values of breakpoints  also appeared to be more negative than whole genome  , suggesting that the values of breakpoints were significantly different from that of whole genomes. the data indicated that recombination preferentially occurred in high negative fors-d regions.

# the fragment numbers were consistent with those of fig. 1d and 2b. * the fors-d values of breakpoints were calculated as described in the methods. the average fors-d values of subtype b' and c hiv- <dig> genome were - <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. the value of < - <dig>   or < - <dig>   represents the region with higher negative fors-d value.

in vitro experiments indicated that strand transfer of rt involved rt pausing and triggering retroviral recombination  <cit> . further evidence showed that secondary structures of rna template, especially, hairpin or stem-loop structures play a key role in rt pausing and strand transfer  <cit> . two obligatory strand transfers of rt had been observed to occur in terminal sequences of viral genome with stable hairpin structures and high stem-loop potential  <cit> . the hairpin structure facilitates rt pausing, which stimulates rt-rnase h activity and results in donor template degradation. pause-induced donor template degradation initiates strand transfer. then, strand transfer is thought to progress through a two-step mechanism, first acceptor invasion, then primer terminus transfer. two models, the kissing hairpin interaction model and the "dock and lock" model, have been proposed to explain this mechanism  <cit> . both models emphasize the key role of hairpin structure in strand transfers. high negative fors-d value, representing high base order-determined stem-loop potential, occurred generally in one or both acceptor and donor sites , which was supported by previous in vitro observation  <cit> .

further evidence for the location of breakpoints was provided by plotting fons, fors-m, and fors-d values of each window against its percentage of breakpoint overlap. figure  <dig> shows the linear regression analysis of the relationships between fons , fors-m , and fors-d  values  and breakpoint overlap. in form fig.  <dig>  we observed that plots for fors-m were horizontal, and plots for both fons and fors-d slopes were slightly diagonal . the slopes of the least-squares regression lines for fons and fors-d values were significantly greater than zero . the regression analysis indicated that fons and fors-d values correlated negatively with breakpoint overlap, and that the correlation coefficient, as well as p value, also supported these relationships . fons value represents the total stem-loop potential, and fors-d provides a measure of the contribution of base order alone to the stem-loop potential of a sequence. negative fors-d values imply that local base order favors the formation of stable stem-loop structures. therefore, the observation above suggested for the first time that occurrence of natural recombination was associated with high base order-determined stem-loop potential, and local base order was likely to be important for the initiation of natural recombination by favoring the formation of stable hairpin structures  <cit> . in addition, the present results supported the previous observation that hairpin structures were involved in retroviral recombination  <cit> . however, a further study to extend the fors-d analysis to other intersubtype recombinants  circulated in other countries and regions of the world should be conducted.

does the information of local base order expressed by fors-d values play a key role in the selection of evolutionary strategies for reducing the selective pressure?
two crfs and multiple forms of urfs have been detected in yunnan province of china, where needle or syringe sharing among idus is popular  <cit> . needle or syringe sharing increase the risk of dual virus infections and subsequent recombination between different subtypes of viruses. to date, however, little is known about whether or not these new recombinants are associated with stronger infectivity and higher replication ability. we do know that the location of natural recombination is not random throughout the hiv genome, and there are some specific hot spots for recombination situated in the genome. previous experimental observations in vitro revealed that hairpin structures increase the rate of recombination between viruses  <cit> . here, our results support that previous notion, and indicated firstly that natural recombination was associated primarily with high base order-determined stem-loop potential .

fors-d value tends to fluctuate around zero and determines the trend of fons value. it contains a large amount of evolutionary information about nucleic acids, and generally appears to be negative number  <cit> . negative fors-d values favor the formation of stem-loop structure and are widely distributed in long genomic segments from a variety of species. positive fors-d values, represent the conflict of evolutionary pressures on base order, and occur more frequently in regions under positive darwinian selection, such as promoter regions, exons and so on  <cit> . the regions with positive fors-d values indicate a tendency for local base order to support protein encoding function rather than formation of stem-loop structure. therefore, fors-d value generally appears to correlate positively with base substitution densities and dn/ds ratio  <cit> . on the other hand, our previous and present studies showed that fors-d values were associated with the occurrence of deletion  <cit>  and recombination mutations, which suggests that local base order is involved in the occurrence of both recombination and deletion. because positive fors-d values correlate with high ratio of base substitution and negative fors-d values for recombination or deletion, we can deduce that local base order plays a critical role in the selection of gene evolutionary pathways. however, further evidence is required to support this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
by analyzing the fors-d values of hiv- <dig> subtypes b' and c, both of which represent the parent strains of crf07_bc, crf08_bc and china urfs  <cit> , we found that most breakpoints of these recombinants were located in regions with higher negative fors-d values, and appeared to have a higher negative average fors-d value than for the whole genome. the regression analysis indicated further that fors-d values correlated negatively with breakpoint overlap. these results suggested for the first time that occurrence of natural recombination was associated with high base order-determined stem-loop potential, and that local base order might play a key role in the initiation of natural recombination of hiv- <dig> by favoring the formation of stable stem-loop structures. combining with previous reports that fors-d correlates positively with the ratio of base substitution  <cit> , we could deduce that local base order might play a critical role in the selection of gene or genome evolutionary pathways, and determines the evolutionary strategies adopted by gene or genome to reduce the selective pressure.
