BACKGROUND
in conifers, as in other plant species, many physiological and biological processes are synchronized with the day/night cycle of their environment, such as photosynthesis, shoot elongation, growth in height, and xylem pressure potential of saplings  <cit> . at the cellular level, daily dynamics of xylem cell radial growth, volumetric changes, and supply of cell wall components have been observed  <cit> . in addition, trees native to temperate and boreal regions show an annual active-dormant cycle, which affects aspects of physiology such as growth in height and photosynthetic capacity  <cit> . these diurnal and seasonal changes are considered important traits for survival and growth in environments that vary daily and throughout the year.

transcriptome dynamics plays important roles for diurnal and seasonal adaptation in plants to synchronize them with environmental changes, and may be under clock control  <cit> . signal transduction mechanisms due to changes in light are well studied in the model angiosperm arabidopsis thaliana. light signals are perceived and transduced via photoreceptor phytochromes and cryptochromes to the central oscillators of the clock, which consist of three interlocked feedback loops  <cit> . the first loop, called the central loop, consists of toc <dig> , lhy  and cca <dig> . lhy and cca <dig> proteins bind to a region in the toc <dig> promoter that is critical for its regulation by the clock  <cit> , and toc <dig> represses expression of lhy and cca <dig>  <cit> . the second loop, called the morning loop, consists of lhy, cca <dig>  prr <dig> and prr <dig>  lhy and cca <dig> induce expression of prr <dig> and prr <dig>  while prr <dig> and prr <dig> repress expression of lhy and cca <dig>  <cit> . the third loop, the evening loop, consists of gi , toc <dig> and evening complex proteins lux , elf <dig> and elf <dig>   <cit> . stability of gi and degradation of toc <dig> are controlled by the blue light receptor ztl   <cit> , and the ztl protein is stabilized by gi in blue light  <cit> . the activity of evening complex protein elf <dig> is regulated by light through degradation by the ubiquitin e <dig> ligase cop <dig>   <cit> . the expression dynamics of some transcripts is under circadian clock control. depending on the experiment and calculation method,  <dig> to 16% of genes have been reported as being circadian regulated in arabidopsis  <cit> . expression of photosynthesis genes peaks near the middle of the subjective day and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes peak before subjective dawn  <cit> . genes encoding starch-mobilizing enzymes, genes implicated in cell elongation and genes related to hormone are also circadian-regulated  <cit> .

recently, homologues of cca <dig>  gi, ztl, and prr <dig> were isolated from the conifer picea abies, and analysis of ectopic expression of the four genes in arabidopsis indicated that the protein functions of pacca <dig>  pagi and paztl are partly conserved  <cit> . this suggested the existence of the three-loop network in coniferous species as well. however, gyllenstrand et al. reported that cycling of clock genes of p. abies is rapidly dampened in free-running conditions, in contrast to observations of clock gene expression in most other plant species  <cit> . since angiosperms and gymnosperms are considered to have separated evolutionarily  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , it would not be surprising if conifers had different control mechanisms. the clock and its relationship to diurnal dynamics of the transcriptome are still largely unknown in conifers. also, differences in diurnal transcriptome dynamics between periods of growth and dormancy have not been extensively investigated, although such differences may play an important role in perennial plants.

japanese cedar  d.don) is a major forestry species in japan. studying the diurnal and seasonal regulation of its transcriptome is fundamental to understand environmental adaptation mechanisms, and unavoidable to advance research into important characteristics controlled by diurnal and seasonal rhythms, such as wood formation, growth in height, and flowering. moreover, studying japanese cedar is interesting from the view of evolution of the clock, since cryptomeria is a gymnosperm and is an evolutionarily old conifer genus with fossils dating back to the cretaceous period  <cit> . in this study, we focused on diurnal transcriptome dynamics in summer  and winter . we first collected sequence data for genes expressed in shoots to design a microarray for japanese cedar using three different methods : two suppression subtractive hybridization  libraries and one normalized complementary dna  library were created to obtain sequence data for genes expressed especially in the daytime and nighttime in summer. next-generation sequencing  was performed to obtain exhaustive sequence data on genes expressed throughout the day and year. microarray analysis identified diurnal transcriptome dynamics in summer, when tree growth is greatest, while dynamic changes were not detected in winter, when trees went dormant. gene network analysis of the microarray data revealed new insights into temporal regulation of transcripts in conifers, including clock genes that might influence diurnal transcriptome dynamics. moreover, we isolated putative homologues of the core clock  and photoreceptor genes, and identified their expression patterns and the position of japanese cedar within the phylogenetic tree of the plant kingdom. this study provided fundamental gene expression data that will help to understand molecular mechanisms of diurnal and seasonal adaptation in conifers.

RESULTS
collecting sequence data from japanese cedar shoots and designing a microarray
two ssh libraries and one normalized cdna library were constructed to obtain gene sequences expressed specifically during the day and night in summer . a forward library  containing genes expressed predominantly at midday was constructed by subtracting driver rna isolated from shoots at midnight from tester rna isolated from shoots at midday. a reverse library  containing genes expressed predominantly at midnight was constructed by subtracting driver rna isolated from shoots at midday from tester rna isolated from shoots at midnight. ssh <dig> and ssh <dig> respectively consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> expressed sequence tags  varying in length from  <dig> to 799 bp with an average length of 488 bp. these ests were assembled into  <dig> sequences, with  <dig> contigs sharing ests from both libraries. however, we found no significantly upregulated genes at either midday or midnight. the blastx algorithm was used to search for the top hits of each sequence in the arabidopsis protein database with an e-value cutoff of e- <dig>  leading to  <dig> annotated est sequences from ssh <dig> and  <dig> from ssh <dig> that were categorized by go annotation . the normalized cdna library was constructed from an rna mixture extracted from shoots collected at midday and midnight to obtain gene sequences expressed extensively in the daytime and nighttime in the summer . we obtained  <dig>  cdna sequences varying in length from  <dig> to 828 bp with an average length of 655 bp. the  <dig>  cdna sequences were assembled into  <dig>  sequences including  <dig> contigs. go categorization was carried out using the  <dig>  annotated sequences from the  <dig>  sequences .

ngs was carried out on an rna mixture isolated from shoots of diurnal and seasonal series of samples to obtain sequences of genes expressed throughout the day and year . we obtained  <dig> mbp of sequencing data in the form of  <dig>  reads averaging 426 bp in length that passed the quality filter of gs runprocessor. adapter sequences were trimmed, and reads shorter than 50 bp were removed from the sequence data. subsequently, the reads that matched arabidopsis retrotransposons and simple sequence repeats  of japanese cedar registered in the sugi genome database were excluded from the ngs data with the aim of removing unnecessary sequences prior to assembly. the frequency distribution of  <dig> mbp of  <dig>  reads is illustrated in additional file 3a. these reads were entered as assemblies run in the gs de novo assembler, and  <dig>  reads were placed into  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons. further assembly was performed to predict putative transcript sequences, and the  <dig>  contigs were placed into  <dig>  isotigs. the frequency distribution of isotigs is illustrated in additional file 3b. gene descriptions of isotigs and singletons were predicted by blastx, and the go categorization of  <dig>  targets from ngs that hit unique arabidopsis gene ids with an e-value cutoff of e- <dig> is provided in additional file 2c.

microarray probes were designed based on sequences from the ssh and cdna libraries and the ngs isotigs. ngs singletons  that showed high homology to any arabidopsis gene with an e-value threshold of e- <dig>  and singletons with hits to arabidopsis genes related to circadian rhythms, photosynthesis, or hormones listed in the kegg pathway  without any e-value cutoff were preferentially selected as probe candidates. identical sequences  were eliminated from the proven candidates, and finally, a microarray consisting of four probe sets corresponding to  <dig>  sequences  was designed. a summary of the original libraries containing the  <dig>  sequences is in additional file  <dig> 

general overview of transcriptome
shoot samples were collected every four hours from 4: <dig> for two days  in summer . we collected samples from three cuttings at each time point as biological replicates. all  <dig> summer samples were analyzed using a microarray and grouped into  <dig> categories according to their sampling time. also,  <dig> selected winter samples  were analyzed by the microarray. since no targets showed any significant differences between 12: <dig> and 24: <dig>  we estimated that very small or no periodic changes in expression occurred in winter, and all data for winter samples were grouped together. the  <dig> total groups  were compared in all possible combinations, and  <dig>  targets, corresponding to  <dig>  unique genes, were observed to be significantly differentially expressed in one or more groups. principal component analysis  of the  <dig>  unique genes demonstrated that transcriptome differences between summer and winter were represented by principal component  <dig> , and diurnal transcriptional changes in the summer by pc <dig>  and pc <dig> .figure  <dig>

identification and clustering of cycling genes in summer
statistical analysis by the genecycle package  <cit>  indicated that  <dig> targets on the microarray were periodically expressed over a 1-day cycle with a two-fold difference in summer . of the  <dig> targets,  <dig> targets corresponding to  <dig> unique genes  were annotated by blastx analysis to arabidopsis proteins, while the other  <dig> targets were not. according to the ranking of fold changes in peak-to-trough amplitude, targets of core clock genes  were within the upper  <dig> . putative genes for heat shock proteins, chlorophyll a/b binding family proteins , dentin sialophosphoprotein-related protein, cycling cdf factor  <dig>  and b-box type zinc finger family protein also showed large oscillations with more than 15-fold changes. there were  <dig> unannotated targets within the upper  <dig>  go analysis indicated that the  <dig> cycling genes had more than a two-fold higher percentage of genes with functions in the ‘cell wall’  and ‘extracellular’  cellular component categories than the entire set of genes on the microarray . the  <dig> cycling genes were classified into four clusters based on similarity of their expression patterns, and each cluster consisted of genes that showed peak expression in the morning , at noon , in the evening  and at night  . comparing the clusters in the cellular component category , cluster  <dig> contained a higher proportion of transcripts related to ‘cell wall’ , with the other clusters containing  <dig>  to  <dig> %. cluster  <dig> contained a higher proportion of genes functioning in the ‘er’ , while the other clusters contained up to  <dig> %. cluster  <dig> contained more than a three-fold higher proportion of genes functioning in the ‘mitochondria’  compared with cluster  <dig> . in the molecular function category , clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contained approximately two-fold more genes related to ‘transporter activity’  than cluster  <dig> , and cluster  <dig> contained approximately four-fold more genes in the ‘protein binding’  category than cluster  <dig> . in the biological process category , cluster  <dig> contained more genes with functions in ‘response to abiotic or biotic stimulus’  and ‘response to stress’ , and fewer genes related to ‘transport’  than the other clusters.figure  <dig>

summer gene network
gene network analysis was carried out using the  <dig>  targets with the highest coefficient of variation in the normalized datasets of  <dig> summer samples . we found that all of the  <dig>  targets constituted one gene network. targets with a large number of children may be core genes for transcriptional regulation. the target with the top blastx hit to a chaperone dnaj-domain superfamily protein had the largest number of children , followed by a target that hit a dnaj heat-shock n-terminal domain-containing protein . another  <dig> targets, such as putative genes for deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase , maternal effect embryo arrest  <dig> , sigma factor e , pyruvate phosphate dikinase , cytochrome p <dig> family member  and cdf <dig> also had more than  <dig> children . we extracted  <dig>  edges that showed bootstrap probability higher than  <dig>  and  <dig> related targets corresponding to  <dig> unique genes from the entire gene network for more reliable data . the network file is available from additional file  <dig>  we focused on the clock genes that are components of the new conceptual framework for the arabidopsis clock provided by pokhilko et al.  <cit> . the five genes isolated  and putative prr <dig>  prr <dig> and cop <dig> genes  were included in this extracted gene network. although prr <dig> was not considered a member of the arabidopsis clock framework by pokhilko et al., we included prr <dig> in japanese cedar, since the function of the prr family is still unknown in conifers. in the estimated network, the four clock genes  were located close together in the gene network. cjlhya and putative prr <dig> were direct child genes of cjgi with bootstrap probabilities of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. cjztl was a child of the gene encoding a dna/rna polymerase superfamily protein , which was a child of cjgi. the two clock genes, cjlhyb and putative prr <dig>  were both children of exordium like  <dig>  and a gene for chaperone dnaj-domain superfamily protein . cjlhyb was a child of the unannotated target ssh24-3-25_002_a <dig>  which was a child of prr <dig> figure  <dig>

transcriptome differences between summer and winter
by comparing microarray data from summer and winter regardless of sampling time,  <dig>  targets showed significant differences in expression level. of these,  <dig>  targets corresponding to  <dig> unique genes showed more than a four-fold difference, consisting of  <dig> genes upregulated in summer and  <dig> in winter. the top  <dig> differentially expressed targets are listed in additional file  <dig>  putative genes for tetraspanin <dig> , glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family protein, expansin a <dig>  and peroxidase superfamily protein  were upregulated more than 200-fold in summer, while putative genes for burp domain-containing protein  and elip <dig> were upregulated in winter. go categorization indicated that the proportion of genes associated with ‘extracellular’  and ‘cell wall’  in the cellular component category , with ‘kinase activity’  in the molecular function category , and with ‘dna or rna metabolism’  in the biological process category  was more than two-fold larger in summer. on the other hand, ‘nucleus’  and ‘mitochondria’  in the cellular component category , ‘transporter activity’ , ‘dna or rna binding’  and ‘transcription factor activity’  in the molecular function category , and ‘transcription, dna-dependent’  in the biological process category accounted for more than a two-fold larger proportion in winter .figure  <dig>

identification of putative photoreceptor and clock-related genes from japanese cedar
we isolated six homologues of clock genes from japanese cedar. the two homologues of lhy and cca <dig> were named cjlhya and cjlhyb . they showed high homology in a single myb domain  <cit>  with arabidopsis lhy at the amino acid level  and two homologues in the moss physcomitrella patens, ppcca1a and ppcca1b   <cit> . however, the amino acid sequences of the other regions were highly divergent. we constructed a phylogenetic tree using amino acid sequences for lhy and cca <dig> homologues from plants . genes from seed plants divided into the three clusters of eudicots, monocots and conifers, and cjlhya and cjlhyb are positioned within the coniferous cluster. a homologue of arabidopsis toc <dig>  a member of the prrs, was identified in japanese cedar and named cjtoc <dig>  . the amino acid sequence identity of a receiver domain and a constans/constans-like/toc <dig>  motif  <cit>  were  <dig> and 74%, respectively . a phylogenetic tree of prrs from plant species showed three clusters consisting of homologues of prr <dig>  prr3/prr <dig> and prr5/prr <dig> . cjtoc <dig> belongs to the prr <dig> cluster with homologues of other conifers, p. abies, pinus sylvestris and pinus pinaster. the amino acid sequence of cjgi isolated from japanese cedar revealed high sequence homology with gi of arabidopsis and a lycophyte  gi, with an e-value of  <dig>   . a phylogenetic tree of gi showed three clusters consisting of homologues of monocots, eudicots and conifers . the isolated cjgi belongs to a conifer cluster with homologues from p. abies and picea sitchensis. cjztl and cjztl-like showed high amino acid sequence similarity to arabidopsis ztl, both having an e-value of  <dig>   . the homology of a lov/pas domain and an f-box domain  <cit>  was 83% and 80% respectively for cjztl, and 62% and 61% for cjztl-like with respect to arabidopsis ztl . six kelch repeat sequences were also detected from both cjztl and cjztl-like by a domain search using the pfam database with a threshold e-value of e- <dig>  we constructed a phylogenetic tree with the other blue light receptors, lkp <dig>  and fkf <dig> . the plant ztl/lkp2/fkf <dig> genes were classified into two groups, ztl/lkp <dig> and fkf <dig> . cjztl belonged to the ztl/lkp <dig> group and cjztl-like was isolated from both groups.figure  <dig>

diurnal rhythms in transcription of clock-related genes
we analyzed expression patterns of  <dig> transcripts of putative clock-related and photoreceptor genes isolated in this study by quantitative pcr  to estimate the reliability of microarray data. very similar results  were obtained for the transcripts using both techniques for expression analysis , suggesting that the data obtained in this study are reliable. the microarray and qpcr data revealed significant oscillations in expression of cjlhya, cjlhyb, cjtoc <dig>  cjgi and cjztl in summer, except for cjztl-like . the level of transcription of putative lux , an evening complex protein  <cit> , reached a peak at 16: <dig> . putative prr member genes prr <dig> and prr <dig> also showed diurnal expression patterns. the transcriptional level of putative prr <dig> remained at the maximum value from 8: <dig> to 20: <dig>  and that of prr <dig> reached a peak at 16: <dig> and subsequently declined . transcriptional levels of putative cop <dig> reached a peak at 8: <dig> . in the winter, transcriptional levels of the core clock genes did not oscillate . the expression levels of cjlhya, cjlhyb, cjtoc <dig>  cjgi, cjztl, prr <dig>  prr <dig> and cop <dig> in winter were similar to their maximum expression level in the summer. among the six photoreceptor genes isolated, only cjphyp and cjcry <dig> showed diurnal oscillations of small amplitude that peaked at 4: <dig> . by comparing the transcriptional levels between summer and winter regardless of sampling time, we observed more than a four-fold increase in cjcry2a expression in winter.figure  <dig>

discussion
the existence of diurnal transcriptome dynamics in summer was clearly demonstrated by pca of microarray data . about  <dig> % of unique genes  showed diurnal rhythms with more than two-fold changes in peak-to-trough amplitude . although different calculation programs were used to detect cycling genes, almost the same proportion of cycling genes  in eucalyptus planted in the field in early spring has been reported  <cit> . in populus trees, 18% of genes on a microarray exhibited a diurnally influenced expression pattern  <cit> . on the other hand,  <dig> targets that showed significant oscillation with more than a two-fold difference in diurnal amplitude in japanese cedar had no blastx hits against arabidopsis proteins . these targets might include genes specific to conifers that take part in unique regulation of diurnal rhythms.

we classified the  <dig> cycling genes into four clusters based on their expression pattern, and each cluster showed a different proportion of go categories . this may be an indication of the relationship between diurnal transcriptome dynamics and diurnal changes in physiological and biological conditions. the rate of growth in height of japanese cedar began to increase after midday, reached a peak around dawn, and subsequently decreased . this diurnal rhythm in the growing pattern of japanese cedar matched that reported by gyokusen  <cit> , and was consistent with reported volumetric changes in differentiating cells  <cit> . hosoo et al. reported that diurnal periodicity in the supply of cell wall components to developing second walls is associated with changes in light intensity during the photoperiodic cycle  <cit> . our microarray data demonstrated that genes related to cell wall components account for a disproportionately large percentage of cycling genes  relative to all genes on the microarray , and the proportion increased during the nighttime . three genes putatively encoding expansins, which are linked to cell enlargement and cell wall changes, oscillated and reached peak expression at noon in this study . putative genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase, which also plays important roles in cell growth, also oscillated, but the peak times of expression varied . in arabidopsis, hormone-related genes believed to be responsible for hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction are co-expressed at the time of day when the hypocotyl growth rate is maximal, in the morning under short-day conditions  <cit> . to determine whether the same phenomenon exists in japanese cedar, we analyzed the expression patterns of the hormone-related genes that represent hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways: the phytohormone genes listed by michael et al.  <cit> , the genes involved in hormone signaling listed in the kegg database, and the genes of the hormone synthetic pathway listed in the riken plant hormone research network . of the  <dig> cycling genes,  <dig> genes that may be related to growth hormones  showed diurnal rhythms . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> belonged to cluster  <dig> or cluster  <dig> . this result indicates that most growth hormone-related genes show expression peaks from morning to noon, although the growth rate of japanese cedar is maximal in the evening, unlike arabidopsis   <cit> .

many genes categorized under ‘response to stress’ and ‘response to abiotic and biotic stimulus’ based on go annotation had peak expression at noon . since summer temperatures during the experimental period reached nearly 30°c and the photosynthetically active radiation exceeded 2000 μmol/m2/sec at midday , the trees might have been subjected to stress. more than  <dig> putative genes for heat shock proteins, which function as molecular chaperones to help to cope with heat stress, showed cyclical transcriptional levels and most had peak expression at noon . the plant hormones abscisic acid  and ethylene are believed to be important components in the crosstalk between stress signaling pathways. in japanese cedar,  <dig> putative aba-related genes were diurnally regulated, including putative homologues of genes that are also induced by drought stress in arabidopsis   <cit> , and  <dig> of them reached peak expression during the day . putative genes for ethylene receptors ers <dig>  and etr <dig>  had peak expression at morning . also, expression of erf <dig> , which is a central regulator of leaf growth under water limiting conditions in arabidopsis  <cit> , was upregulated at evening . covington et al. investigated circadian microarray data, revealing that plant hormone and multiple stress response pathways are influenced by the circadian clock  <cit> . more than 40% of aba-induced genes are circadian-regulated in arabidopsis, and the majority of these genes reach peak transcriptional levels during the subjective morning in arabidopsis. also, of the genes induced by oxidative stress or reactive oxygen species production under various stress conditions, such as bright light, drought, or extreme temperature, 34% are clock-regulated  <cit> . it is difficult to know from this study alone whether the expression of these stress-related genes in japanese cedar is controlled by the integration of environmental cues or the circadian clock. however, japanese cedar regulated transcripts of stress-related genes, which might have helped to adjust to the severe daytime environment.

the genes we observed showing variation in expression during two consecutive days in the summer were part of one big network, indicating that their expression was closely coordinated. for more reliable results, we extracted edges of the network that showed more than  <dig>  bootstrap probability and their related targets from the entire gene network . although further studies are necessary to evaluate this network, this one gives many hints for selecting genes that play an important role in the regulation of diurnal transcriptome dynamics in conifers. the presence of putative core clock genes in this extracted network shows their importance in the diurnal regulation of the transcriptome. the five genes isolated  that were predicted homologues of arabidopsis core clock genes because of their position within phylogenetic trees and similarity in their domains  were included in the extracted network. each homologue of japanese cedar constituted a coniferous cluster with that of p. abies reported by karlgren et al.  <cit> . expression patterns  of cjlhya, cjlhyb, cjtoc <dig> and cjgi  were similar to those in arabidopsis under long-day conditions, according to the diurnal database on the website of the mockler lab, donald danforth plant science center . the two homologous genes, cjlhya and cjlhyb, had high homology in their amino acid sequences; however, their transcriptional expression patterns were slightly different. while transcripts of cjlhya reached a peak from 4: <dig> to 8: <dig>  cjlhyb reached a peak at 4: <dig> and began to decline at 8: <dig> , and while transcriptional levels of cjlhya showed more than a 100-fold difference between the maximum and minimum, that of cjlhyb showed only a 10-fold difference. gene network analysis indicated that these two homologous genes are located at different positions , and suggested that they might have different roles in the network and regulate different genes at different times. the blue light receptor gene ztl is constitutively expressed but displays circadian fluctuation at the protein level in arabidopsis  <cit> . also, paztl in p. abies does not oscillate under light/dark cycles  <cit> . however, we observed that cjztl transcripts oscillate in japanese cedar , as also reported for etztl in eucalyptus in field conditions and for mcztl in iceplant  under light/dark cycles and free-running conditions  <cit> . the other blue light receptor, fkf <dig>  is clock regulated at the transcript level, while lkp <dig> is not in arabidopsis  <cit> . since the expression pattern  of these genes showed no phylogenetic relationship , differences in their expression might have resulted from independent events occurring during evolution. alternatively, the differences in expression may be caused by differences in environmental or developmental conditions.

interestingly, most genes for photoreceptors and photosynthesis-related genes did not show any significant oscillation in japanese cedar , although light is one of the most important factors that influence diurnal rhythms and most such genes show diurnal or circadian expression patterns in angiosperms. in arabidopsis, photoreceptor phytochromes and cryptochromes are involved in setting the clock by transducing the light signal to the core clock, and all photoreceptor genes are regulated by the clock  <cit> . the sequences of cjphyo and cjphyp had high homology to the partial sequences of phyo  and phyp  of japanese cedar reported by schmidt and schneider-poetsch  <cit> . however, the sequence of cjphyn <dig> did not match phyn <dig> , as also reported by schmidt and schneider-poetsch  <cit> . since independent duplications have led to two copies of phyn in conifers except for the pinaceae  <cit> , cjphyn <dig> might be another copy of phyn. expression analysis indicated that of the three phytochrome genes, only cjphyp oscillated with small amplitude . moreover, among the three isolated cryptochrome genes, only cjcry <dig> oscillated with small amplitude. the oscillating photoreceptors cjphyp and cjcry were genetically distinct from the other homologues, which did not oscillate . genes encoding the chlorophyll a/b-binding polypeptides of the light harvesting system  are controlled by the circadian clock in some plant species  <cit> . eleven lhca/b genes in arabidopsis reveal circadian expression  <cit> , and all  <dig> lhca/b genes in tomato  reveal diurnal and circadian expression  <cit> . also, lhcb mrna in protonema cells of the moss p. patens and lhca <dig> mrna in the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii oscillate during light–dark cycles  <cit> . we obtained  <dig> full open reading frame  sequences from the ngs sequences of japanese cedar that had high similarity to arabidopsis lhca/b genes based on the top blastx hit . all  <dig> sequences showed e-values lower than 5e- <dig>  a phylogenetic tree was constructed with homologues from arabidopsis, japanese rice, a lycophyte  and a moss , using distinct relatives of lhca/b genes in arabidopsis, elip <dig> and elip <dig>  <cit> , as an outgroup. the tree indicated  <dig> clusters consisting of  <dig> groups, lhca <dig> through  <dig> and lhcb <dig> through  <dig> . one or two of the lhc genes of japanese cedar were classified into each group, except for the lhcb <dig> group. although the distinct relatives of lhca/b genes, elip <dig> and elip <dig>  <cit> , showed significant oscillation , only four of the eight lhcb genes  showed daily oscillations, but they were of small amplitude, and none of the lhca genes oscillated. genes encoding the photosystem i and ii reaction centers did not cycle with more than two-fold changes in japanese cedar, unlike arabidopsis  <cit> . the phyd gene of moss also showed a diurnal rhythm, with peaks observed in the light phase  <cit> . in conifers, light-independent expression of photosynthetic genes seems to be a general phenomenon  <cit> . lhcb and psba  mrna levels show only small diurnal fluctuations under light/dark cycles and no circadian rhythm under continuous light or dark conditions in douglas fir   <cit> . by analyzing dark-grown seedlings, expression of lhcb genes has been shown to occur in darkness in various conifer species  <cit> . expression of phya/c-related genes in dark-grown p. abies seedlings has also been reported  <cit> . the mechanisms of regulation of these light-related genes in conifers might be different from those in angiosperms.

the microarray data showed massive transcriptional changes between summer and winter . the genes functioning in ‘developmental process’ and ‘cell organization and biogenesis’ were upregulated in summer , including gibberellin-related genes  and genes related to cell division and elongation  . in the winter, expression of genes for basic chitinase, osmotin, elip <dig> and late embryogenesis abundant protein  <dig> , reportedly markers of cold hardiness in p. sylvestris  <cit> , were also induced . diurnal transcriptome dynamics were not detected in the winter, and transcription of the core clock genes was constitutively high . winter disruption of clock genes has also been observed in chestnut   <cit> . low temperature  reportedly reduces the amplitude of cycles for clock components in arabidopsis and chestnut, and the cycles of output genes are dampened or disrupted in arabidopsis  <cit> . a similar phenomenon might occur in japanese cedar in winter. in arabidopsis, core clock components cca <dig> and lhy regulate expression of the cbf  pathway, which is highly conserved among plants and has a major role in plant freezing tolerance  <cit> . reducing the expression of lhy genes by rna interference compromises freezing tolerance in populus trees  <cit> . the expression of clock genes may be influenced by seasonal environmental changes, and consequently, may lead to activation of downstream pathways that contribute to freezing tolerance, which is important for survival of tree species in winter.

CONCLUSIONS
studies of diurnal and circadian mechanisms in plants have until recently focused on the model species arabidopsis, with limited data available outside angiosperms. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first exploration of diurnal transcriptome dynamics in gymnosperms. microarray analysis showed significant differences in transcriptome dynamics between summer and winter. it also showed diurnal transcriptome dynamics in summer and revealed that  <dig> % of the genes on the microarray were rhythmically expressed, while the rhythm was disrupted in winter. the cycling genes in summer constructed a gene network with the core clock genes, which may contribute to adaptation to diurnal and seasonal environmental changes. in summer, hormone-related genes tended to be upregulated from morning to noon and stress-related genes were upregulated at noon. these results indicated that the transcripts differed according to the sampling time, and that time at collection should be considered for analysis of transcription, because it may influence the results. phylogenetic analysis indicated that conifers have genetically distinct clock genes from angiosperms. conifers may contain unique diurnal regulation mechanisms. interestingly, unlike angiosperms, photoreceptors and photosynthesis-related genes did not show significant oscillation in japanese cedar. we also identified  <dig> cycling targets  that did not have blastx homologues in arabidopsis. these proteins might play an important role in controlling diurnal rhythms unique to conifers. independent studies are necessary for gymnosperms, and this study provides fundamental data to understand diurnal transcriptional regulation in conifers.
