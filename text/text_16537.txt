BACKGROUND
mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles in eukaryotes. their primary function is the production of metabolic intermediates and cellular atp through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathway. for this reason, mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular and developmental processes including pollen development and cytoplasmic male sterility   <cit> . mitochondria have their own genomes, which harbor genes for ribosomal rnas , transfer rnas  and subunits of the respiratory complexes. extensive research has been performed to understand organization and function of mitochondrial genomes. to date , more than  <dig> plant mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced, including those of  <dig> seed plant species , and of a large number of protists, algae, fungi, and animals. these studies have greatly improved our understanding of mitochondrial gene content, genome size and organization, mutation rate as well as gene shuffling events. the sequenced mitochondrial genomes exhibit significant variation in both size and actual gene content, despite the universally conserved sequence that exists between the mitochondrial genomes of diverse species  <cit> . the size of sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes varies more than 12-fold among angiosperms, ranging from  <dig> kbp in white mustard   <cit>  to over  <dig>  kbp in muskmelon   <cit> , while the number of genes only varies between  <dig> and  <dig> including  <dig> to  <dig> protein-coding genes  <cit> . the significant variation in size of the mitochondrial genome between species is explained by expansion of the inter-genic regions, structural rearrangements and intra- or intermolecular recombination events  <cit> . gene shuffling events in higher plant mitochondrial genomes have occurred due to the presence of repeated sequences  <cit> . in combination with sequence duplication events, this has resulted in a unique diversity of plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . therefore, the dna sequence of plant mitochondria has become an important tool in phylogenetics for comparison of the evolutionary relationships among species. in addition, sequencing of the mitochondrial genome has the potential to increase our understanding of the complex genetic interactions between the nuclear and the organellar genomes.

perennial ryegrass  is a diploid  member of the poaceae family and one of the most important forage and turf grass species of temperate regions worldwide  <cit> . its economic importance has led to the establishment of high-density genetic maps as well as genome and transcriptome sequence resources. for example, the complete chloroplast genome sequence has recently been published  <cit> , and assembly of the genome sequence is currently being progressed  <cit> . however, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of perennial ryegrass as well as of any other forage and turf grass species was hitherto unknown.

therefore, the main objective of this study was to sequence, assemble and annotate the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome. specifically, we aimed at  describing the organization of the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome for future comparative analyses of mitochondrial genomes within lolium and between closely related grass species,  identifying protein-coding genes, rrna genes, trna genes and open reading frames  to understand the function the mitochondrial genome, and  gaining first insights into the mitochondrial transcriptome of perennial ryegrass.

RESULTS
isolation of intact mitochondria and extraction of mtdna
a cellular fraction containing crude mitochondria were isolated from perennial ryegrass leaf tissue by homogenization followed by differential centrifugation. further attempts to purify the mitochondria by percoll density gradient centrifugation failed. the crude mitochondrial fraction was characterized by measuring the activity and latency of cytochrome c oxidase  as a marker enzyme for the intactness of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and malate dehydrogenase , an enzyme residing in the mitochondrial matrix as well as in the cytosol and several other places in the cell  <cit>  . the large increase in specific cco activity indicates that there was a  <dig> -fold enrichment of mitochondria from the homogenate to the crude mitochondrial fraction as expected. the latency of cco measures the ability of the substrate, reduced cytochrome c, to reach the active site of the enzyme on the outer surface of the inner membrane. the high cco latency in both homogenate and crude mitochondria indicates that the outer membrane was mainly intact  <cit> . only a small fraction of mdh activity co-purified with the mitochondria, but its latency increased dramatically  indicating that the major part of the lost mdh had been present outside the mitochondria and that the crude mitochondria contain most of its mdh behind the permeability barrier of an intact inner membrane  <cit> . thus, the crude mitochondrial fraction contained mainly intact mitochondria , in which the mtdna was protected inside intact outer and inner membranes .

*data are means ± sd of two separate isolations each of 30 g fresh leaves.

subsequently, contaminating nuclear and chloroplast dna was removed by treating the crude mitochondrial fraction with dnase. the isolation of mtdna from intact mitochondria from 60 g  fresh weight leaves resulted in  <dig>  μg mtdna.

sequencing and assembly of the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome
a total of  <dig>  single reads were generated with a mean length of 403 bp  from the mitochondrial genome of the perennial ryegrass genotype f1- <dig> using roche  <dig> gs-flx titanium sequencing . this resulted in a 167-fold coverage of the mitochondrial genome. the contaminating chloroplast sequence reads were removed by performing a reference assembly against the chloroplast genome . the isolated mitochondrial dna was contaminated with approximately 2% chloroplast dna .

*removal of reads matching chloroplast dna.

the initial assembly generated  <dig>  contigs totaling  <dig>  mbp with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides. the longest contig was  <dig>  bp, and the shortest contig was 116 bp. a blastn search was performed against the nucleotide collection of ncbi aiming to remove contaminating contigs. nine out of  <dig>  contigs were identified as plant mitochondrial dna sequences with a mean length of  <dig>  bp . the remaining  <dig>  contigs corresponding to  <dig> % of the  <dig> mbp total sequence information were contaminating sequences which was discarded. these contigs were mainly single read sequences related to other organisms . these nine contigs of the initial assembly could not be further arranged into a single circular molecule mainly for two reasons. firstly, there were cases of misassembled contigs, and secondly there were cases where repetitive sequences led to a breakdown of the assembly process. in order to further resolve the arrangement of the nine contigs, we made use of the sequence information available from a perennial ryegrass nuclear genome sequencing project that is ongoing in our lab, which contained assembled contigs and scaffolds originating from the mitochondrial genome. this assembly included mate-pair illumina libraries with insert sizes of up to  <dig> kbp, which helped us to predict the order and orientation of a number of the nine mitochondrial contigs. this was then followed by a process of designing primers to span contigs, followed by sanger sequencing to fill in the gaps and, ultimately, merge the contigs . the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of perennial ryegrass has been deposited to genbank under the accession number jx  <dig>

introns
among the  <dig> protein-coding genes, only nine  contain introns. all the introns in sequenced mitochondrial genomes are classified as group ii introns  <cit> . a total of  <dig> group ii introns were found within the nine protein-coding genes including four trans-spliced introns that are part of nad <dig> and nad <dig> . in total, twenty-two cis-spliced introns are present in nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  cox <dig>  ccmfc and rps <dig>  among  <dig> trna genes, one trna gene trnlcaa contains an intron.

open reading frames 
an orf may be defined as an in-frame dna sequence of 300 bp or longer that is bordered by a start and stop codon, with no match to a coding sequence in the public databases  <cit> . in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, we found  <dig> orfs with a minimum and maximum length of  <dig> and  <dig>  bp, respectively, and with a mean length of 452 bp covering  <dig> % of the genome .

repetitive regions and their gene content
a variety of repetitive dna sequences were found in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome. there are four pairs of large inverted repeat  sequences, with repeat lengths of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, as well as one large directly repeated  sequence of  <dig>  bp , with 99% sequence identity. overall, these five large repeats account for  <dig> % of the mitochondrial genome. the genes, nad <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  trnd, trnc, trnq, trnk, trnm, trnp, trns and trnw, were found as multiple copies located in the large inverted repeat sequences in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome .

a total of  <dig> pairs of short inverted repeat  sequences were identified covering  <dig>  bp  of the mitochondrial genome. percent matches between sirs were higher than 68%, with  <dig> pairs of sirs showing values higher than 80%, while thirteen pairs of sirs had a sequence identity of 100%. the average sir length was 52 bp, and the longest sir identified was 333 bp .

the mitochondrial genome of perennial ryegrass contained  <dig> tandem repeats, which covered  <dig>  bp corresponding to  <dig> % of the total sequence. the average period size and copy number were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the most common type of tandem repeat had period sizes of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which totaled 42% of all tandem repeats found in the mitochondrial genome .

simple sequence repeat sequences
we found  <dig> ssrs in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with mono-, tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide repeats, respectively. ssrs with dinucleotide repeats were not found. the length of the mononucleotide, trinucleotide and pentanucleotide repeats range from 10– <dig>  9– <dig> and 15–20 bp, respectively. all the tetranucleotide repeats are 12 bp long . of  <dig> trinucleotide repeats, only  <dig>  were present in the coding regions in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome.

transposable element-related sequences
the presence of transposable elements  was also investigated using two different te databases; poaceae and triticeae as queries from the genetic information research institute . in total,  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp  of the total genome sequence showed homology with tes in poaceae and triticeae, respectively. the tes were mainly long terminal retrotransposon  elements . the circular master molecule coordinates of the tes are presented in additional file 5: table s <dig> 

areference dna; bold face, sum of fragments and lengths.

transcriptome analyses
we performed an expression analysis of the  <dig> mitochondrial protein-coding genes  using in-house rna-seq data from the reproductive tissue of perennial ryegrass inflorescence . the results are presented both as total number of reads matching the genes or as the number of reads corrected for the gene length . the most abundantly expressed genes in terms of total numbers were cob, cox <dig> and atp <dig>  which all had more than  <dig>  matching reads. however, when comparing normalized expression, the most highly expressed genes were nad <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  atp <dig> and rps <dig> with more than  <dig>  reads per kbp gene length. eleven genes had low expression , namely ccmb, rps <dig>  rps4-p, rps7- <dig>  rps7- <dig>  rps14- <dig>  rps14- <dig>  rpl5- <dig>  rpl5- <dig>  matr and mttb. of these, the genes rps14- <dig>  rps14- <dig>  rpl5- <dig>  and rpl5- <dig> had fewer than  <dig> matching reads per kbp gene length. the genes encoding subunits of the respiratory complexes  all showed high expression both in absolute numbers and after normalization. in contrast, the genes encoding ribosomal proteins varied enormously in their expression levels .

discussion
intactness of mitochondria
to obtain mtdna uncontaminated by nuclear or chloroplast dna, crude but intact mitochondria were isolated. because the mtdna is located behind two permeability barriers in intact mitochondria – an intact inner membrane as monitored by mdh latency  <cit>  and an intact outer membrane as monitored by cco latency  <cit>  – treatment with dnase removed contaminating chloroplastic and nuclear dna without degrading the mtdna. the fact that only 2% of the sequenced contigs were chloroplastic  shows that this strategy was successful.

difficulties of de novo assembly of a plant mitochondrial genome
although the average length of the gaps between the contigs was only 122 bp, it was not straightforward to close the gaps through pcr amplification of the missing dna segments. this was mainly due to misassembled, duplicated and repetitive dna sequences in the nine de novo assembled contigs. few reports have been published on mitochondrial genome sequencing using next-generation sequencing due to assembly difficulties of short reads even when a reference genome exists  <cit> .

many next-generation sequencing platforms produce paired-end or mate-pair reads, which collectively can be referred to as read-pairs. because the approximate physical distance of the read pairs are known, the paired nature of these reads constitutes a powerful source of information, significantly facilitating genome assembly, because they can span repetitive regions, and therefore can be used to join contigs.

it is currently not possible to isolate nuclear dna from plants without having the nuclear dna contaminated with organellar dna . thus, organellar genomes are also to a certain degree being sequenced as part of a nuclear genome sequencing project, and prior to filtering, the perennial ryegrass genome draft therefore also contains mitochondrial contigs and scaffolds. the mitochondria-related scaffold information was used to re-assemble, order and orientate the mitochondrial contigs in our mitochondrial genome assembly, and for primer design to facilitate pcr amplification across gaps.

features of the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome
the final assembly of the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome resulted in a single circular molecule of  <dig>  bp with an average g+c content of  <dig> % . the g+c content is very similar to that of other sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes such as rice ,  <dig> %; bamboo ,  <dig> %; sugar beet ,  <dig> %; melon ,  <dig> %; arabidopsis   <dig> % and rapeseed ,  <dig> %  <cit> . the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome contains  <dig> genes including genes encoding known proteins and rnas. among the identified genes,  <dig> genes  are single-copy genes. the remaining  <dig> genes are multi-copy genes of nad <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  trnd, trnc, trnq, trnk, trnm, trnp, trns, trnw and two pseudogenes, rps4-p and trnf-p . the  <dig> genes gave a density of one coding region per  <dig>  kbp, which is less compact than bamboo, rice and arabidopsis   <cit> . gene distribution between two dna strands depends on the different genomic configuration  <cit> , but generally shows no extreme strand bias  <cit> . in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, two protein-coding genes, nad <dig> and nad <dig> are trans-spliced,  <dig> genes are encoded on the forward strand, and  <dig> on the reverse strand. all the rrna genes are located on the forward strand except the rrn26- <dig> gene, while  <dig> trna genes are found on the forward strand and  <dig> on the reverse strand .

gene fragments, pseudogenes and chloroplast-derived genes are excluded. genes with the same number of copies in all five species are not included. afrom bamboo   <cit> , rice   <cit> , maize   <cit> , and wheat   <cit> . lower case letter indicates exons of this gene.

the coding and intron sequences occupy  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the genome, respectively, including  <dig> protein,  <dig> trna and  <dig> rrna genes . in the maize  nb mitochondrial genome coding sequences account for  <dig> % of the total genome  <cit> . generally, the functional mitochondrial rrna and trna genes of the sequenced angiosperm mitochondrial genomes lack introns  <cit> . we found that one trna gene, trnlcaa contains an intron in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome. similar results have been found in the date palm  mitochondrial genome where three trna genes, trnkttt, trnnatt and trnsupcta, also contained an intron  <cit> . further work is needed to determine if the perennial ryegrass intron containing trna gene, trnlcaa is functional.

the variation in the number of mitochondrial genes between species is mainly due to differences in gene content for the subunits of complex ii, and especially ribosomal proteins and trnas  <cit> . multiple copies of rrna genes were found in perennial ryegrass , and also in the mitochondrial genomes of sugar beet and wheat   <cit> . all the known respiratory genes, except for the complex ii genes sdh <dig> and sdh <dig>  are present in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome . both sdh <dig> and sdh <dig> genes are functional in tobacco and melon  <cit>  but absent in all other species, as reviewed by ma et al.  <cit> . sdh <dig> has been identified as a pseudogene in arabidopsis, rapeseed and sugar beet  <cit> . although the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome contains some multi-copy genes, it lacks the rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> genes . rpl <dig> is missing in sorghum , tripsacum, maize and sugar beet  <cit> ; it is functional in arabidopsis, rice, rapeseed, tobacco and melon  <cit> ; and it is a pseudogene in wheat and bamboo  <cit> . rps <dig> is only present in tobacco and melon  <cit> . the rps <dig> gene is present in liverwort  but has not been found in eudicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species except for the rice mitochondrial genome which retains rps <dig> as a pseudogene  <cit> . the rps <dig> gene is functional in rice, bamboo, and tobacco, and has been identified as a pseudogene in wheat and arabidopsis. in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, we found multiple copies of the rps <dig> gene, which has only been identified as a functional gene in rapeseed  <cit> . the comparison of all  <dig> ribosomal protein and both complex ii  genes in  <dig> diverse angiosperms has demonstrated frequent loss of some of these  <dig> mitochondrial genes during angiosperm evolution  <cit> . it seems that genes encoding ribosomal proteins and complex ii proteins are species-specific. in order to understand the gene loss and gain event in the angiosperm mitochondrial genome, it might be interesting to know the compensation pathway of the genes which are missing in the mitochondrial genome. the compensation pathway might be the first reason that genes which are no longer necessary to function in the cell can disappear entirely from the cell. the second reason is gene substitution or gene replacement, where the function of the missing mitochondrial gene is still needed and is directly replaced by a preexisting nuclear gene whose product can play the same role in the mitochondrion  <cit> .

the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome has  <dig> rrna genes, rrn <dig>  rrn <dig> and rrn <dig>  encoding the small subunit and large subunit rrnas, which are present in all characterized mitochondrial genomes. the rrn <dig> gene is very small . in contrast to the rrna genes in the mitochondrial genome, the mitochondrial 5s rrna gene is absent in the mitochondrial genome of some fungi, animals and protists  <cit> , and present only in the lands plants, a subset of algae  <cit>  and in the protozoan  <cit> .

plant mitochondrial genes are translated using the universal genetic code and require trnas for all  <dig> amino acids, and the composition of the trna genes, encoded by the plant mitochondrial genomes, are to a high degree unique in angiosperms. in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome,  <dig> functional trna genes are found for  <dig> amino acids. one pseudogene, trnf-p remains non-functional in the genome. post-transcriptional modification within the anticodon sequence might be necessary to generate a functional trnf-p gene. thus, functional trna genes for six essential amino acids, ala, arg, gly, ile, thr and val, are missing from the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome , although trnas for  <dig> amino acids are required for protein synthesis in mitochondria. the missing six are presumably encoded by the nuclear genome and imported from the cytosol into the mitochondria  <cit> . the trna gene content of the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome was compared with eight other grass mitochondrial genomes, and differences were observed with respect to presence or absence of trnas for ala, arg, gly, ile, leu, thr, trp and val among these plant species. plastid-derived trnas were not considered in the comparison . in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, twenty-four trnas display a classical clover leaf structure, whereas each of the two trna-ser  fold into an unusual four-loop secondary structure. one of the trnas  has a two stem clover leaf structure. in the maize nb mitochondrial genome, trna-sergcu and trna-seruga have a five loop secondary structure  <cit> .

in addition to protein and rna-coding genes, we identified  <dig> orfs larger than 300 bp in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome . only orfs found outside the genic regions of the mitochondrial genome were included in the analysis. the number of orfs larger than 300 bp identified in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome are comparable to previously reported for other species such as maize , sugar beet , arabidopsis , rice , wheat  and tobacco   <cit> .

gene content in the repetitive regions
the mitochondrial genome of perennial ryegrass contains multiple copies of the genes nad <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  trnd, trnc, trnq, trnk, trnm, trnp, trns and trnw . all of the multi-copy protein genes are located in the inverted repeat regions, and multi-copy rna genes are located in both repeat and inverted repeat regions . as for trnp, two copies were identical, whereas the third copy differed by a single nucleotide. the trnm- <dig> also differed from trnm- <dig> by a single nucleotide. similarly, as for trnq in the wheat mitochondrial genome, two copies are identical, whereas the third copy differed by a single nucleotide  <cit> . a comparison of multi-copy mitochondrial genes among grass genomes such as ryegrass, bamboo, wheat, rice and maize , suggests that gene duplication is a species-specific phenomenon  <cit> . the large repeated sequences covers  <dig> % of the maize nb mitochondrial genome  <cit> , while such sequences covered  <dig> % in perennial ryegrass.

splicing
splicing is often part of post-transcriptional modification of messenger rnas . it involves the excision of non-coding intron sequences from a precursor rna and subsequently ligation of the flanking exon sequences to produce a mature transcript. two types of splicing were found in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome: cis-splicing, the intramolecular ligation of exon sequences on the same precursor rna, and trans-splicing involving the intermolecular ligation of exon sequences from different primary transcripts  <cit> . trans-splicing is characteristic for angiosperm mitochondrial introns, particularly for genes encoding complex i subunits  <cit> . of  <dig> introns of the protein-coding genes, only four were trans-spliced , confirming that trans-slicing is less common than cis-spicing  <cit> . in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, two genes nad <dig> and nad <dig>  encoding proteins of nadh dehydrogenase subunits  <dig> and  <dig>  were each split into  <dig> exons. in nad <dig>  exon nad1a was located far from the other four exons on the other stand. in case of the nad <dig> gene, exons nad2a and nad2b were found approximately 265 kb from the other three exons on the other strand.

genome diversity
the mitochondrial genomes of flowering plants are more complex than those of animal and fungi  <cit> . they extensively vary in size , gene content, genome rearrangement patterns and presence of repetitive sequences. multiple copies of a few of the conserved full-length genes or exons are found in the mitochondrial genome , which has also undergone size expansion when compared between plant species. in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, only  <dig>  bp  of the total dna sequences encode proteins, rnas and orfs , while the vast majority of the genome sequence has unknown function.

in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, the rps4-p and rps <dig> genes are conserved to each other in the 5′ end  but they do not share the sequence. the blastn result confirmed that the 3′ end of the rps4-p gene has no homology with rps <dig> gene of other species reported so far. thus, the rps4-p gene might be a variant of the ribosomal gene, rps <dig> or a pseudogene in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome. the amino acid sequences of rps <dig> and rps4-p genes in perennial ryegrass were aligned with the amino acid sequences of the rps <dig> gene of maize , sorghum , rice , wheat  and bamboo , . the alignment showed that only  <dig> amino acids  of the rps4-p gene are conserve to the rps <dig> gene. transcriptome analysis confirmed that both rps <dig> and rps4-p are expressed in the reproductive tissue of the perennial ryegrass. both rps <dig> and rps4-p genes had low normalized expression pattern  . in addition, we also found two ribosomal protein genes, rps <dig> and rpl <dig>  sharing 110 bp of sequence between them . the shared sequence was located in the second exon of rps <dig>  and at the beginning of the rpl <dig> gene. similarly, in the wheat ks3-type mitochondrial genome, ksorf <dig> has 46 bp shared sequence with the cob gene  <cit> .

plant mitochondrial genomes contain tes, dna sequences that can move from one position to another. tes can constitute an appreciable fraction in the genome and are found in most species with the exception of liverwort  <cit> . in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome, we found  <dig> and  <dig> te fragments of various sizes covering a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp based on comparison to the triticeae and poaceae databases, respectively . the sequences varied in length and the elements were dispersed in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome . the tes appear to be more abundant in grasses than cereals. in the perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome only  <dig> % or  <dig> % of the genome showed homology with transposable like elements, most of which resemble retrotransposable elements, suggesting that their contribution to the expanded perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genome is negligible.

gene expression profile
in this study, the expression profile of perennial ryegrass mitochondrial genes was studied in reproductive flower tissues . in reproductive tissues, the mitochondrial density and activity is especially high presumably because the energy and biosynthetic requirement is particularly high during reproduction, i.e., during pollen development  <cit> . the generally high expression level of all of the encoded subunits of the respiratory complexes in the mitochondrial genome  is consistent with that observation. however, there were some variations between the expression levels of the complexes:

complex i, the nadh dehydrogenase, contains around  <dig> subunits, one copy each per complex, in higher plants  <cit>  where nine are mitochondrially encoded in perennial ryegrass . the normalized expression levels for all of the complex i subunits were generally high and varied about 3-fold .

complex iv, cytochrome c oxidase, contains 12– <dig> subunits out of which three are mitochondrially encoded in most plants including perennial ryegrass . all three subunits were highly expressed .

complex v, the atp synthase, consists of about  <dig> subunits, five of which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome in perennial ryegrass , while the remaining are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and imported into the mitochondria to be assembled with the mitochondrially encoded subunits into a complex in the inner membrane. the normalized expression levels of all the atp synthase  genes was relatively high in perennial ryegrass reproductive tissues and varied <3-fold with the exception of atp <dig> , which had a  <dig>  times higher expression than the second highest, which is atp <dig>  . this may be significant given that subunit c of the complex is present in 10– <dig> copies per complex and the alpha subunit is present in three copies while all the other mitochondrially encoded subunits are only present in one copy each per complex v  <cit> . thus, the mrna levels in perennial ryegrass mitochondria as expressed by the normalized read numbers are correlated with the biosynthetic requirement for complex v subunits. previous studies have shown that the atp <dig> gene is highly expressed in male flower of date palm, and in pollen mother cells of arabidopsis <cit> .

finally, the four genes encoding proteins involved in cytochrome c biosynthesis, ccmb, ccmc, ccmfc and ccmfn, were all expressed, but not at particularly high levels . an earlier microarray analysis of mitochondrial gene expression at the early stage of wheat shoot tissues reported that the ccmfn gene showed increased transcript level under three different stress conditions, low temperature , high salinity  and high osmotic potential   <cit> .

protein biosynthesis in plant mitochondria takes place on bacterial-type ribosomes, where  <dig> of the subunits are encoded in the perennial ryegrass genome . out of these, eight had low normalized expression levels , while three  showed high expression levels  . four of the ribosomal protein genes were hardly expressed at all  which may be because they are non-functional, or because they are required in other tissues, but not in the reproductive tissues in perennial ryegrass. consistent with the latter hypothesis, two ribosomal protein genes, rps <dig> and rps <dig>  are much more abundantly expressed in roots than in other tissues of date palm  <cit> .

transcription does not necessarily lead to protein synthesis. an astonishing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total mitochondrial genomes of rice and date palm, respectively, are transcribed, which is due to rna synthesis from large parts of the regions outside the annotated genes. for comparison, only  <dig> % of the date palm mitochondrial genome is translated into proteins  <cit> . the functions of the transcribed inter-genic regions of plant mitochondrial genomes are not well understood.

the expression of the mitochondrial genes in plants is carried out by phage-type rna polymerase encoded in the nuclear genome  <cit> . the process of gene expression in plant mitochondrial dna is rather complex, influenced by multiple promoters, rna processing and particularly at the post-transcriptional processes, splicing and editing  <cit> . prior to transcription, the rna polymerase is capable of promoter recognition, initiation, and elongation on their own but need auxillary factors to recognize all transcription initiation sites  <cit> . the sequence analysis of the arabidopsis mitochondrial genome showed that potential promoter motifs exist in the inter-generic regions  <cit> . in addition, a number of annotated genes do not show potential promoter sequences confirming the possibility that other sequences can initiate transcription  <cit> . for this reason, transcription is actually initiated from a variety of promoter sites in the genome  <cit> . thus, transcription in plant mitochondria produces both cryptic transcripts from regions that do not contain genes or from the opposite dna strand of the genes; as well as defective transcripts encoded by the genes but failing to complete the complex post-transcriptional process to become functional transcripts  <cit> . once initiated, transcription sometimes give rise to extremely large transcripts due to the absence of efficient transcription termination in plant mitochondria  <cit> . this contributes significantly to the transcription of the inter-genic regions. therefore, large portions of the mitochondrial genome are transcribed but not translated into proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, the mitochondrial genome of perennial ryegrass has been sequenced, successfully assembled and annotated. the data presented here constitute a primary platform to understand the organization and function of the mitochondrial genome in one of the most important forage and turf grass species. the circular mitochondrial master molecule will be useful for comparative mitochondrial genomics and for future research on agronomically important traits such as cms.

perspectives
perennial ryegrass is a dominant forage species in the temperate regions worldwide, and its main role is to provide forage to the ruminant animals. eighty per cent of the world’s cow milk and 70% of the world’s beef and veal are produced from temperate grasslands  <cit> . a major portion of these grasslands is covered by perennial ryegrass, which is, however, not well adapted to regions with severe winter or hot summer  <cit> , unless the geographic range of the species can be extended by developing more robust cultivars. one way to increase productivity, nutritional quality and tolerance towards biotic and abiotic stress is to maximize the genetically available heterosis using hybrid breeding schemes. however, hybrid seed production requires a tool to efficiently control pollination, a tool such as cms. the mitochondrial genome is a key to understanding the origin and function of cms and will – in the long term – facilitate the development of hybrid cultivars in allogamous forage grasses.
