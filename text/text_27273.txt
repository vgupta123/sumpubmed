BACKGROUND
well over half of the earth's surface is cold: deep oceans, mountains, polar regions. likewise, earth's solar system contains many planets and planetary bodies that are also cold. the cold environments on earth are teeming with life  <cit>  offering hope that other cold environments in our solar system such as mars and jupiter's moon, europa, may harbor life  <cit> . for this reason it is surprising that so little is know about the lifestyle, particularly of microbial psychrophiles at low temperatures.

psychrophiles have been studied primarily to understand biological mechanisms of adaptation to extreme conditions. microbial physiologists have long been interested in psychrophiles as they employ mechanisms allowing them to maintain life processes at temperatures where rates of reactions and molecular properties present challenges. in reaching for an understanding of how life processes work at extremes of temperature, most of the focus to date has been on the properties of enzymes of extremophiles . no single consistent answer has emerged to account for adaptation to temperature extremes. to date, no single type of modification is uniformly found in the enzymes of psychrophiles; instead numerous small and subtle differences appear to account for their increased flexibility thereby enabling them to function at low temperatures.

recently whole genome sequences have been determined for psychrophiles colwellia psychrerythraea  <dig> h  <cit> , idiomarina loihiensis l2tr  <cit> , and pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis tac <dig>  <cit> . we now add the genomic sequence of the extreme species, psychromonas ingrahamii  <dig> which grows at even colder temperatures. availability of complete genome sequences provides the opportunity to search all of the proteins of the organisms for similarities and differences that might have bearing on the ability of the organism to grow at low temperatures.

the extreme psychrophile, psychromonas ingrahamii was isolated from sea ice from the arctic. it grows exponentially with a doubling time of  <dig> hours at -12°c and may well grow at even lower temperatures  <cit> . these temperatures do not necessarily solidify salt water or cytoplasm into ice. liquid water has been shown to exist at grain contacts as low as -20c  <cit> .

RESULTS
the p. ingrahamii genome
the single, circular chromosome of  <dig>  mb constituting the genome of p. ingrahamii  <dig> was sequenced as a set of contigs by the doe joint genome institute production genomics facility,  <dig> mitchell drive, walnut creek, ca  <dig>  and finished at doe joint genome institute, bioscience division, los alamos national laboratory, los alamos, nm  <dig>  it was annotated at oak ridge national laboratory, oak ridge, tn  <dig> and deposited as genbank file cp <dig> . altogether  <dig> genes were identified,  <dig> of which were proteins of  <dig> residues or longer. a second round of annotation is described below.

properties of proteins
size
one can ask whether the sizes of proteins of a psychrophile differ from those of a mesophile. the sequences of all proteins of p. ingrahamii were compared to sequences of all proteins of three other bacteria: shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig>  vibrio cholerae and escherichia coli k- <dig> mg <dig>   <dig> protein sequences were conserved among all four bacteria. the great majority of the conserved proteins were enzymes. the distribution of lengths of the  <dig> orthologous proteins were compared, revealing that the distribution was about the same for the comparable proteins in all four bacteria . ideas that proteins that are required to function at low temperatures would be either shorter or longer than those of mesophiles are not borne out.

amino acid composition
amino acid composition of an organism's proteins is affected by nucleotide composition of the dna. the gc content of p. ingrahamii dna was determined experimentally to be 40%  <cit> , verified by the composition of the total genome nucleotide sequence . overall amino acid content of the encoded proteins compared to those of v. cholerae, s. oneidensis and e. coli is shown in table  <dig> . the amino acids isoleucine, asparagine, lysine, phenylalanine and tyrosine all are present in higher percentage in p. ingrahamii.

*esccol = escherichia coli mg <dig>  shewone = shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig>  vibcho = vibrio cholerae, psying = psychromonas ingrahamii 37

however, like the genome, the codons for these residues are gc rich, a factor that must be taken into account. codon usage for p. ingrahamii is shown in table  <dig> for all cdss  and for the highly expressed genes tuf, tsf, fusa+rp genes . thus when amino acid content is examined as a function of gc3s, correcting for gc content at synonymously variable third positions, the overall amino acid composition of p. ingrahamii was found not to be remarkable. at the value of  <dig>  determined for p. ingrahamii, amino acid contents fall on the curves generated for gc3s dependency in  <dig> other organisms    <cit> .

correspondence analysis 
lobry and chessel  <cit>  examined datasets of amino acid content and codon usage in thermophilic and mesophic bacteria and found evidence that the amino acid composition of thermophilic proteins was under the control of a pressure at the nucleic acid level, not a selection at the protein level. an extended study  <cit>  produced similar results of no connection. however, the authors identified the most discriminating codon as being agg for arginine, present in many thermophiles, not in either mesophiles or a psychrophile. p. ingrahamii fits this observation in that it does not use the agg codon .

we analyzed the amino acid compositions of all individual proteins of p. ingrahamii by ca  <cit>  after trimming the first  <dig> and last  <dig> residues because there is a strong nucleotide bias at these positions. data for each protein is presented in additional file 1: "ping correspondence analysis.xls". clustering of groups of proteins with similar composition was performed using a bayesian approach as proposed by bailly-bechet et al.  <cit>  figure  <dig> presents a plot of the first three most informative axes: hydrophobicity, aromaticity and asparagine content.

the proteins fell into six classes whereas most bacteria contain at most five well separated clusters with bayesian clustering and at most four with dynamic clouds clustering  <cit> . proteins of two bacterial proteomes examined to date fall into four clusters, aeropyrum pernix and thermoplasma acidophilum  <cit> . subsequently it was seen that psychrophilic p. haloplanktis has  <dig> clusters  <cit> , exceeded now by p. ingrahamii, a more extreme psychrophile, which resolves into six. in p. ingrahamii, the bulk of the proteins fall into three clusters . the integral inner membrane proteins  fall largely into clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . in other bacteria the iimps are distinctly separate from the bulk of other proteins  <cit> . in p. ingrahamii, however, separation is poor and there is some continuity between the iimps and the bulk proteins. evidently the property of hydrophobicity is not distributed in psychrophile proteins as in mesophiles.

not seen in any other bacteria viewed to date by ca is the sixth group, cluster  <dig>  this group is of  <dig> proteins characterized by an excess of threonine that forms a bleb protruding from one of the core protein clusters. examining the annotations of these proteins reveals that almost half are hypothetical proteins with no homologs in other bacteria examined at threshold pam  <dig>  it is tempting to suggest this group of proteins could be involved in facilitating low temperature growth.

as to amino acid content, one sees that asparagine occurs more frequently than expected for a random distribution, and on the other hand that cysteine, methionine, arginine and histidine are relatively rare . this same asparagine-driven bias has been seen in other psychrophiles, notably p. haloplanktis  <cit> . deamidation via cyclization into aspartate threatens integrity of asparagine, a process which is sensitive to higher temperature, providing a rationale for an asparagine excess in psychrophiles. the corresponding lower amounts of cysteine, methionine, arginine and histidine can be understood as decreasing proportions of these oxygen-sensitive residues. oxygen concentrations are higher in the liquid medium at low temperatures. although similar composition gradients were seen in another psychrophile, p. haloplanktis, they are stronger in p. ingrahamii, perhaps correlated with its lower growth temperatures.

thus, the main features that emerged from the ca of p. ingrahamii protein compositons  are that  there are more classes of proteins than have been seen in other bacteria,  one of these classes, cluster  <dig>  has a high proportion of "orphan" hypothetical proteins,  iimps merge into bulk proteins rather than occupying a separate space, possibly due to iimps having lower hydrophobic character, and  one notes the strong opposition between asparagine, sensitive to heat, and the amino acids methionine, arginine, cysteine and histidine, sensitive to oxygen.

annotation
of the  <dig> genes for proteins of length  <dig> or more,  <dig> are fusions of two genes which in other organisms are separate and independent. they are distributed as  <dig> fused enzymes,  <dig> fused regulator components,  <dig> fused abc transporter components,  <dig> fused phosphotransferase system  components and  <dig> mixed enzyme-regulator combinations. fused genes can cause problems with annotation based on results of sequence similarity algorithms. to avoid such problems, we split fused genes for purposes of sequence comparisons in order to be able to identify orthologs of both parts independently.

the first round of annotation was carried out at oak ridge national laboratory, posted for public access august  <dig>  <cit> . we have here supplemented this data with manual analysis using the dynamic search programs of the darwin system  <cit> . in this system after first approximations of sequence similarities, amino acid substitution tables are recalculated appropriate to degree of similarity and to the codon usage, and then pairwise alignments are produced. degree of similarity between two sequences is expressed as percent identity and as pam values   <cit> .

we first processed the p. ingrahamii protein sequences in relation to the then-completed  <dig> bacterial genomes. we extracted from this data the match with best  pam score for each p. ingrahamii protein. the descriptions of the orthologs were retrieved from refseq and/or genbank at the national center for biotechnology information  web site  <cit> . the results allowed us to add some predicted protein products to the initial jgi annotation results.

since the set of  <dig> bacterial genomes we first used was not balanced in respect to types of bacteria, we also identified orthologs in a reference set of  <dig> genomic sequences of organisms which were chosen to span the breadth of bacterial species. to include other sequenced psychrophiles, the set includes two additional marine species, c. psychrerythraea  <dig> h and i. loihiensis. c. psychrerythraea  <dig> h grows over the range -1c to 10c  <cit> ; i. loihiensis has a broad temperature range from 4c to 46c  <cit> .

annotations and function information are attached in additional file 2: "ping annotations  <dig> xls". the rank order of similar sequences and number of "best hits" are shown in table  <dig> 

* sizes greater than  <dig> residues

surprisingly, the organism with greatest similarity is v. cholerae. it is surprising because neither is v. cholerae one of the psychrophiles nor is it any member of the order alteromonadales. p. ingrahamii is a member of the family alteromonadacae in the order alteromondales. psychromonas is related to other members of this family such as shewanella, colwellia and idiomarina  <cit> . like some other members of these families, p. ingrahamii is a marine organism and has gas vesicles. we found there are extensive similarities with proteins of other alteromonads as expected, but there are even more similarities with v. cholerae, even though the the order vibrionales and family vibrionaceae are separate from the alteromonadales  <cit> . this observation may be explained by the selected conservation of genes from a common ancestor between these two genera and their loss by their closest relatives or it may indicate confusion due to unexpected horizontal gene transfer of 16s rdna within these lineages.

in manually curating, we used practices aimed both at discovery and at caution. whenever a "best match" was annotated as a hypothetical protein, yielding no information, we looked to the next best match. sometimes the next best match was a very good one which provided useful information based on the annotated gene product of that ortholog.

it is widely appreciated in the genomics community that annotation by transfer of stipulated annotations from other organisms becomes ever more problematic at lower levels of similarity and as the number of sequential steps of sequence matches increases between the query and an experimentally demonstrated gene product. we were careful to be conservative in attributing a gene product if the match was not very close. when pam scores were low , we transferred directly the annotation of the match; but when in a middle range, 75– <dig>  we sometimes generalized, removing specificity ; and when pam scores were high, over  <dig>  we often used the word "predicted" to indicate that the assignment was based on a less rigorous threshold than for other assignments.

when formulating words of description of the gene products, we adopted another practice. we made an effort to name similar products similarly. we have tried to standardize product descriptions to some extent in order to make information on like proteins easier to find, thus making a list of alphabetized product names useful.

assignments
from the above two sets of ortholog matches combined with the work of the jgi scientists, we constructed a table of p. ingrahamii gene numbers and corresponding best-guess annotated gene products available in additional file 2: "ping annotations 2". included in the table are the gene number, the type of gene product  and the name of the protein. . altogether  <dig> proteins originally characterized as unknown gained an annotation by the manual process, some suggestive, others substantive.

kinds of proteins
* sizes greater than  <dig> residues

horizontal transfer
eighty-one genes were identifiable as currently known horizontally transferrable loci such as transposases of insertion sequences and integrases of phages. thus clearly horizontal exchange of mobile elements into the chromosome has taken place. among the bacteria tested, most such loci of p. ingrahamii matched elements of shewanella oneidensis mr <dig>  as is the case with so many genome sequences, we cannot know with currently available information how much of the genome of p. ingrahamii was formed by horizontal transfer and how much vertically inherited.

rna
there are  <dig> ribosomal rna clusters containing 5s, 16s, 23s rnas . the relatively high number could reflect the need for high capacity of translation at cold temperatures and an ability to adapt quickly to changing conditions of nutrient availability  <cit> .  <dig> trna genes support translation.

gene clusters
there are  <dig> contiguous clusters of two or more related genes such as subunits of an enzyme or pathway-related proteins. the largest cluster, for septum formation and peptidogylcan synthesis enzymes, comprises  <dig> genes. these are genes  <dig> through  <dig>  altogether  <dig>  or 25% of cdss, reside in clusters related by function.

paralogous groups
enumeration of sets of paralogs within a genome requires definition of degree of relatedness. in the initial analysis done at oak ridge national laboratory,  <dig> proteins were identified as belonging to  <dig> paralogous clusters. using darwin analysis  <cit>  and a more conservative threshold of relatedness ,  <dig> proteins were identified as grouped into  <dig> paralogous families of sizes ranging from two to  <dig>  this threshold is comparable to that used to enumerate e. coli paralogs  <cit>  and permits comparison. functions of paralogous groups of size  <dig> or above are shown in table  <dig>  just as had been found previously for e. coli, the largest paralogous groups are transporters and regulators. even though enzymes are present in the genome in the largest numbers, they fall into smaller, more differentiated families. for transporters and also regulators, evidently a limited number of mechanisms have evolved for these functions, creating large groups of similar proteins of either transporters or regulators that differ in specificity but not in mechanism of action. enzymes are more diverse, use a larger variety of mechanisms, thus they fall into a larger number of smaller groups of similar proteins.

intermediary metabolism
almost half of all enzymes annotated in p. ingrahamii  were identified as enzymes of small molecule metabolism. not all enzymes of every pathway were found, not unexpected since some orthologs may not reach the threshold of similarity employed, nevertheless there is strong evidence for standard pathways of intermediary metabolism being present.

p. ingrahamii is a facultative anaerobe capable of both respiratory and fermentative metabolism  <cit> . in agreement we find in its enzyme sequences that pathways are present for fermentation, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, the tca cycle and gluconeogenesis. for respiration, electron transfer agents are present such as iron-sulfur centers, flavodoxin and flavoproteins, ubiquinone, and cytochromes; for anaerobic respiration, sequences of reductases for fumarate, nitrate, nitrite and sulfite are present . nitrate reduction has been observed experimentally  <cit> . in addition there are  <dig> members of the short-chain oxidoreductase family and  <dig> oxidoreductases identified by domain. any one of these could be either a primary dehydrogenase or a terminal reductase not yet characterized . the varieties of oxidants that appear to be used by p. ingrahamii suggest that its capabilities in this regard are comparable to that of shewanella species.

enzymes are present for pathways of utilization of both carbohydrates and amino acids as carbon and energy sources. glycerol was the carbon source provided in the medium for the below-freezing temperature growth experiments  <cit> . in agreement, genes for glycerol uptake , glycerol kinase  and dehydrogenase  are present.

carbon sources besides glucose that were found experimentally to be utilized by p. ingrahamii  <cit>  were compared with the list of enzyme orthologs. one finds in p. ingrahamii genes for enzymes for utilization of fructose , galactose , mannitol , n-acetylglucosamine , ribose  and sucrose , in agreement with experimental findings. we also found genetic evidence for the capability to utilize lactose  and glucuronate .

however comparing to e. coli enzymes, many of the sequences of enzymes for utilization of other carbohydrates are not present in p. ingrahamii. these include enzymes for utilization of arabinose, xylose, sorbitol or galactitol. again the absence is in agreement with experimental observations  <cit> . also missing are orthologs of e. coli enzymes for utilization of tagatose, fucose, rhamnose, glucarate, galactarate, altronate or idonate. these carbon sources have not yet been tested in culture. this picture is similar to the one found in s. oneidensis, a relatively poor capacity to utilize a variety of monomeric carbohydrates  <cit> .

although capability for utilization of carbohydrates is restricted, by contrast p. ingrahamii does have sequences for enzymes for utilization of most amino acids, and many of these have been verified experimentally. transaminases convert to the corresponding keto acids, decarboxylases to amines. the amino group can be removed with dehydratases or lyases.

fatty acids, breakdown
the four major enzymes of degradation of fatty acids are present, capable of generating acetyl-coa for general metabolism .

fatty acids, biosynthesis
it has long been known that proteobacteria at low temperatures adjust fatty acid composition to the more flexible unsaturated and/or branched types. p. ingrahamii has genes for enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis . close similarity is found for all e. coli enzymes starting with malonyl-coa, proceeding via malonyl-acp through the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle, each cycle adding 2-carbon moieties. at the 10-carbon level, the pathway of unsaturated fatty acids commences. orthologs for all e. coli enzymes of the unsaturation pathway are present except for the last enzyme, fabi. final steps for synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by p. ingrahamii must differ from those in e. coli. the principal fatty acids that were detected in the organism experimentally are the saturated 16: <dig>  and the singly unsaturated 16:1ω7c   <cit> .

p. ingrahamii has sequences of the four subunits of a polyunsaturase closely similar to the polyunsaturase in psychrophile c. psychrerythraea 34h . it is reasonable to suppose that at the very low temperatures of the environment p. ingrahamii might require fatty acids with more than one unsaturated bond. also branched chain fatty acids are often found at cold temperatures. based on enzyme sequences, precursors for synthesis of the branched-chain fatty acids could be generated as intermediates in breakdown of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. however, neither polyunsaturated nor branched chain fatty acids were detected in p. ingrahamii cultures grown at about  <dig> to 8°c  conditions  <cit> . perhaps the polyunsaturated fatty acids are produced at lower temperatures or were not detected by the fatty acid analysis procedure used.

interestingly, two polyunsaturated fatty acids, 20: <dig>  and 22: <dig> , have been reported from two other species of psychromonas, p. kaikoae and p. marina <cit> .

glycogen storage
there are genes for  <dig> glucose-1-phosphate adenyltransferases  any one of which could serve for the first step in synthesis of glycogen, and there are  <dig> glycogen/starch synthases . one or more of the  <dig> glycosyl transferases could be involved in synthetic reactions.

digestion of macromolecules
like other marine organisms, p. ingrahamii appears to have the capability of utilizing macromolecules in the environment for nutrition and energy. p. ingrahamii has genes for a relatively large number of  <dig> peptidases and proteases . some of these are no doubt required for internal turnover, but some seem likely to be exported out of the cell in order to hydrolyze environmental proteins, thus providing small molecular weight nutrients for uptake. p. ingrahamii has a complete general secretion system capable of excreting such degradative enzymes to the environment. to take up the digestion products of proteolysis, there are abc-type transporters for peptides, many for amino acids. not consistent with this prediction is the experimental observation that gelatin is not hydrolysed  <cit> .

storage glycogen as well as external polysaccharides including starch could be hydrozysed for production of sugars to supply energy. for utilization of some polysaccharides there are amylases, glucosidases, debranching enzymes, and glycosyl hydrolases , some of which may be intracellular and others extracellular. there are  <dig> lytic transglycosylases which, in cleaving peptidoglycan links could be involved in modellingof the cell or could break up environmental cell wall fragments. capability to hydrolyse fats also exists as there are  <dig> lipases,  <dig> phospholipases and a lyso-lipase. there are many enzymes hydrolyzing nucleic acids with different specificities and functions, many with vital internal metabolic roles. in addition, some may be used to hydrolyze external nucleic acid debris .

other hydrolases are encoded in the genome whose physiological roles are not currently known, for example there are  <dig> had-superfamily hydrolases,  <dig> alpha/beta hydrolase fold proteins,  <dig> metal-dependent phosphohydrolases.

chaperones and stress proteins
multiple chaperone proteins are encoded in p. ingrahamii, suggesting that folding of proteins is an important process . there are  <dig> proteins like dnak,  <dig> like dnaj,  <dig> groel monomers and  <dig> groes monomers there are  <dig> peptidylprolyl isomerases , and a clpb protein disaggregating complex. one can speculate that the the role of the chaperones is to guide nascent polypeptides into functional three-dimensional configurations permitting activity at low temperatures. future characterization of some of these chaperones could reveal what kinds of folding are required to retain protein function at sub-zero temperatures. ferrer et al.  <cit>  found that groel of oleispira antartica rb <dig> functioned as a single ring of  <dig> units at cold temperatures, but as a double ring of  <dig> over  <dig> at warm temperatures. they pinpointed two residues as critical to the transition from double to single ring. however on inspection these residues do not occur at the comparable positions in p. ingrahamii groel proteins. actions of p. ingrahamii chaperones at cold temperatures remain to be explored.

p. ingrahamii has genes for a variety of known types of stress proteins: there are  <dig> cold shock proteins,  <dig> heat shock proteins,  <dig> uspa-type stress proteins as well as  <dig> "tellurite resistance" proteins now known to protect against superoxide formation  <cit>  . experimental work will be needed to determine which if any of these have functions directed specifically at living in cold temperatures and if there are other types of stress proteins or any other cold-associated functions among the open reading frames of unknown function.

transporters
compared to e. coli, p. ingrahamii has few transporters specific for sugars and sugar alcohols, but does have many transporters for amino acids . in this respect, it seems that p. ingrahamii is like s. oneidensis and other alteromondales in a capacity to utilize environmental amino acids as carbon  sources, contrasted to less capacity for sugars.

as to types of transporters, the abc type of atp-driven multisubunit transporter is most common in the p. ingrahamii genome, as is the case for other bacteria. also, as for many other bacteria, conventional secondary transporters follow in frequency. however, p. ingrahamii differs from many in the fact that in there are  <dig> sets of the dctm, dctp and dctq genes for the tripartite atp-independent periplasmic transporter systems   <cit>  , more than are found in the three mesophiles whose whole genomes were compared . trap systems specialize in transport of c4-dicarboxylic organic acids such as fumarate, perhaps for anaerobic respiration purposes. the number of 3-gene trap systems in bacteria is variable. e. coli has one, pseudomonas aeruginosa has  <dig> whereas p. ingrahamii has  <dig> of these three-protein systems. recently  <dig> trap systems have been identified in sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig>  <cit> . trap transporters use a proton motive force energized system, simpler and possibly more primitive than the atp-utilizing abc systems. a connection between the trap transporters and low temperature growth is not currently known.

*iim = integral inner membrane

regulators
many types of regulation mechanisms have been identified in p. ingrahamii: transcriptional activators and repressors, cyclic-amp regulation, chemotaxis systems, two-component sensor-response regulators of several types including the twin-arginine translocation  pathway signal sequence domain proteins, also synthesis/breakdown of cyclic-digmp signalling second messengers associated with ggdef and/or eal domains . there are  <dig> regulators of the cyclic-digmp signalling second messenger in the genome, compared to  <dig> in e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig>  cyclic-digmp concentrations are controlled by either a diguanylate cyclase or a specific phosphodiesterase or both, together governing synthesis or hydrolysis of the cyclic-gmp. the types of genes and corresponding physiology regulated by cyclic diguanylate systems so far identified are motility, adhesion factors, fimbriae and biofilm formation.

given the finding of a large number of cyclic-digmp signalling systems, we might guess that p. ingrahamii lives within the matrix of a biofilm. altogether  <dig> glycosyl transferases are encoded , suggesting that polysaccharide, perhaps exopolysaccharide, is a major synthetic product. for export, many efflux proteins are present. an ortholog is present  of the quorum sensing hapr  regulator that is involved in controlling biofilm formation in v. cholerae  <cit> . an extracellular matrix, a major physiological feature of the related s. oneidensis  <cit> , could well be important to life in the cold, providing stability and resilience to the population. since p. ingrahamii lives in sea ice, it is possible that extracellular polysaccharide  may be part of the sea ice microbial community  biofilm although it should be noted that p. ingrahamii was isolated from the ice column above the major biofilm of the simco.

alternatively, the production of eps may serve a role in sequestering water from ambient saltwater at lower temperatures or actually lowering the freezing point. in this regard it is interesting to note that in the -12°c growth experiments, none of the tubes froze after the first week of growth following inoculation suggesting that a product, possibly eps, produced by the bacterium may have lowered the freezing point of the growth medium.

regulation of expression of certain classes of genes is moderated by the sigma factors of the rna polymerase holoenzyme. p. ingrahamii is well endowed, appearing to have genes for sigma factors  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . rpoe and rpoh are both stress-responding factors. rpos operates in stationary phase and also under stress. rpon is concerned with nitrogen metabolism and in v. cholerae regulates flagellin gene transcription. rpod for sigma  <dig> is the primary factor in e. coli.

ribosomes
there are  <dig> ribosomal proteins annotated,  <dig> of which are duplicated, therefore  <dig> unique. of these,  <dig> were found as orthologs with pam values less than  <dig> among the two sets of genomes we examined. organisms with closest matches were, in descending order, v. cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus, s. oneidensis, h. influenzae = i. loihiensis, c. psychrerythraea. again, the close relationship of p. ingrahamii with vibrio species is evident.

osmotic stability
p. ingrahamii grows well over the range  <dig> to 12% nacl  <cit> . to manage the potential for osmotic imbalance, the genes for enzymes to synthesize the osmolyte glycine betaine from choline are present , as well as a transporter to take up choline  or, bypassing synthesis, specific abc transport systems for uptake of glycine betaine are present, . this capability may explain how the organism is able to survive and perhaps grow in the salt pockets that are formed within the sea ice.

motility
there is a large cluster of flagellar genes in p. ingrahamii in the region between gene numbers  <dig> to  <dig> and four copies of sigma factor rpon which is known in v. cholerae to regulate flagellin genes. yet the bacteria in culture have been observed to be non-motile  <cit> . there may be a defect in one of the essential flagellar proteins or in the expression or assembly processes. alternatively, the organism may not always express flagella formation and motility. interestingly, the original description of the genus indicates that other members of the genus are motile  <cit> .

gas vesicles
two kinds of gas vesicles have been observed in the cell under culture . genes orthologous to known gas vesicle genes are present in two clusters, the ranges  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig>  although the two types can be expressed simultaneously in cells, they may be differentially expressed under preferential conditions in the environment.

different kinds of enzyme orthologs in different bacterial relatives
of the  <dig> bacteria chosen to represent the breadth of the currently characterized eubacterial world, the three bacteria bearing the largest number of protein sequences scored as "best matches" with p. ingrahamii proteins are v. cholerae, s. oneidensis and c. psychrerythraea 34h .

about 3/ <dig> of the p. ingrahamii proteins annotated as enzymes, transporters or regulators have orthologs at the level of pam <=  <dig> in either v. cholerae, s. oneidensis or c. psychroerythraea. by contrast, only 19% of p. ingrahamii cdss of unknown function have orthologs in these bacteria. that the vast majority, 4/ <dig>  of p. ingrahamii cdss of unknown function do not have good matches in the most closely related organisms suggests that many proteins in p. ingrahamii are qualitatively different. new, unique functions will not be revealed by annotations that depend on similarity to known proteins, but their existence suggests that further experimental study of this extremophile is worthwhile and could bring new biology to light.

looking within the enzyme category, it is striking that most of the best hit homologs of enzymes of central metabolism are proteins of v. cholerae. this is particularly puzzling since v. cholerae is a mesophile and it is phylogenetically in a different order and family from p. ingrahamii. could this be an example of massive horizontal transfer of genes from vibrio to psychromonas? it seems unlikely since the many genes for central metabolism are not in a few clusters similar to pathogenicity islands, rather they map throughout the chromosome, and the majority of the transposase-type genes have closest orthologs in s. oneidensis. nevertheless, in spite of expectations, we have found that the sequences of enzymes of basic metabolism that function at low temperature are more similar to those of a mesophile than they are to those of another psychrophile, and even more surprising, a mesophile of a different taxonomic order and family. a feature that may suggest global genome reorganization and account for an apparent scrambling of otherwise conserved genes is that the vibrios usually comprise two chromosomes, in contrast to p. ingrahamii which has only one.

different from v. cholerae, one sees that enzyme homologs in s. oneidensis and c. psychrerythraea 34h are largely the enzymes of peripheral and macromolecule metabolism, not the enzymes of central metabolism.

we narrowed our question, looking for a commonality in enzymes among the psychrophiles. we identified the  <dig> proteins in c. psychrerythraea and i. hoiliensis that have highest similarity to p. ingrahamii proteins at pam values =<  <dig>  in this set, there are few enzymes important to central metabolism; many more are involved in macromolecule synthesis and maintenance. there are enzymes dealing with nucleic acids: exo and endo-nucleases, rna helicases, dna polymerase and helicases, transcriptional and translational factors, and recombinases. psychrophily may require differences in the proteins of nucleic acid metabolism since even though the salt content of the sea ice and the low gc content of the dna  should act to lower the melting point of double stranded polynucleotides. however, handling nucleic acid structures at such cold temperatures may also require differences in the interacting proteins. similarly, transcription and translation factors of a particular kind may be required to enable the processes at low temperatures.

unique unknown proteins
we identified a few small groups of proteins that could perform novel functions related to psychrophily, warranting further investigation in the future. a contiguous set of nine genes that could comprise an operon, gene numbers  <dig> through  <dig> have no orthologs in current databases with pam value < <dig>  four of the proteins are paralogous, with similar sequences among themselves. as we are looking for functions in psychrophiles not found in other bacteria, experimental characterization of this group of proteins might be worthwhile.

there are  <dig> groups of genes that could be contiguous operons whose members reside either in cluster  <dig> of the correspondence analysis , or are unknown in other bacteria to date, or both. these are clusters  <dig> through  <dig>   <dig> through  <dig>  and  <dig> through  <dig>  could any or all of these relate to the ability to live and grow at -12c or lower temperatures? we identify these seemingly unique sets of proteins with the thought that when results of proteomic expression experiments on this organism are available, it might be useful to characterize the proteins and to know under what circumstances they are synthesized.

CONCLUSIONS
the p. ingrahamii genome, although it is 25% smaller than the genome of e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> and has many more cdss labeled hypothetical, is similar to e. coli in the distribution of functions among annotated proteins, with enzymes by far the largest category followed by transporters, then regulators. other categories follow distantly. similar to e. coli, the largest paralogous groups within the genome were transporters and regulators, the smaller ones enzymes. although transporters and regulators are fewer in number than enzymes, they form larger paralogous groups. they belong to fewer families employing fewer mechanisms than is the case for enzymes which belong to smaller families of greater variety.

unexpectedly, p. ingrahamii protein sequences were similar to more v. cholerae proteins than to proteins from s. oneidensis or c. psychrerythraea. this is in spite of the fact that vibrio species belong to a different family and order than do psychromonadaceae, shewanellaceae and collwelliaceae, and in spite of the fact that c. psychrerythraea is also a psychrophile.

in a comparison of gross properties of all the proteins of p. ingrahamii differences were not found from those of three mesophiles in several respects: distribution of lengths, total amino acid composition, codon usage when corrected for genomic gc content.

however, correspondence analysis  of the amino acid content of the proteins showed that they cluster in ways that differ from most other bacteria, falling into more clusters that are not as well separated from one another as in other bacteria. this may be a consequence of an unusual distribution of hydrophobicity. one of the clusters is composed almost half of unidentified, unknown cdss. p. ingrahamii contains proteins with relatively high asparagine content, and low content of amino acids potentially sensitive to the higher concentration of oxygn present in cold waters. these properties would seem to be appropriate for an extreme psychrophile.

as to metabolism, p. ingrahamii is a facultative anaerobe capable of both fermentation and respiration. in agreement, proteins similar to the corresponding metabolic pathways and proteins for synthesis and harvest of glycogen storage compound were identified. most enzymes of central small molecule metabolism were most closely related to those of v. cholerae. enzymes of macromolecular synthesis and maintenance are most closely related to those of s. oneidensis and c. psychrerythraea. there seems to be a preference of amino acids over sugars as sources of carbon and energy, perhaps harvested by extracellular degradation of environmental proteins by exported peptidases. to create a more flexible lipid layer adjusted to cold temperatures, sequences of a heteropolymeric polyunsaturase were found. however, the enzyme may not always be active as no polyunsaturated fatty acids were detected in culture. perhaps, however, in nature they are expressed at temperatures lower than the lowest normally used for laboratory cultivation, 6–8°c.

in addition to transporters of types common to other proteobacteria were  <dig> three-component trap systems for c4-dicarboxylic acid transport. in addition to regulators of types common to other proteobacteria were  <dig> regulators of cyclic-digmp second messengers, suggesting that biofilms and their regulation could be an important part of the life style of this psychrophile. alternatively, p. ingrahamii may produce eps to lower the freezing point in the surrounding environment, thereby making water available for low temperature growth.

looking for particular proteins that might be unique to this psychrophile but are not yet in the genomic databases we searched, we have pointed out some sets of gene products that could be starting points for discovering new functions or new types of proteins. we noticed  <dig> contiguous genes that are all unknown hypotheticals,  <dig> of them sequence-related to one another. we also noted three apparent contiguous operons, members of which are unknown hypotheticals and/or members of the unique set of proteins in cluster  <dig>  in future, we recommend that proteomic experiments should be used to explore the shift to cold temperature with a view of keeping an eye out for expression of any of these proteins, potentially part of the mechanisms of life at very cold temperatures.
