BACKGROUND
comparative modeling uses experimentally determined protein structures  to predict the 3d conformation of another protein with a similar amino acid sequence . with the progress of structural genomics initiatives, comparative  modeling has become an increasingly important method for building protein structure models  <cit> . not only is comparative modeling the most accurate method of structure prediction  <cit> , but it also allows a priori estimation of the approximate quality of the models  <cit> . due to their added value  <cit> , models are particularly suitable for comparative studies over complete protein families  <cit> . however, predicted structures in general contain errors and seldom reach the accuracy of experimental structures. hence, improving the quality of comparative models, especially for models where target:template sequence identity is less than 30% still remains a challenge  <cit> .

three elements that influence the accuracy of comparative models  <cit>  are:  the structural similarity between target and template,  the target:template alignment accuracy; and  our ability to refine the model . hence, quality  of a model in terms of these factors can be described as:

  total error = structural difference + alignment error - refinement 

significant effort has been devoted to the development of methods for refinement of models, but to date no protocol has emerged that systematically and predictably improves the quality of comparative models  <cit> . advances in sequence alignment methods have proven successful in improving model accuracy by decreasing the alignment error . most recently, the use of profile-to-profile alignments  <cit>  has shown promise. controlling the structural difference component of the error  to improve model accuracy translates into the problem of selecting the template that is structurally closest to the target. in real modeling cases, the structure of the target is unknown and the structural difference between target and template must be estimated by other means. usually, the template with the highest  sequence similarity is chosen. in spite of some evidences to the contrary  <cit> , a number of modeling examples have shown that it is possible to improve model accuracy by simultaneously using more than one template structure  <cit> . it is expected that the best combination of all available templates needs to be chosen for multiple template modeling. the best possible combination of templates should in principle be that where segments of different templates constitute a template chimera that is structurally closer to the target than any of the individual templates. there are two commonly observed template combinations  where one template structurally complements the other. these are:  absence of structural information in one template can be complemented by a second template ;  a segment of the target that shows low structural similarity with one of the templates may show higher structural similarity with the second template . we refer to these as structural complementarity of the templates. anecdotal evidence indicates that structural complementarity may result in improved model accuracy  <cit> , but so far no systematic study has been performed to assess the effect of multiple templates on the accuracy of comparative models in which the alignment and structural complementarity contributions are dissected. in this work, we address the effect of additional templates of lower sequence identity on the accuracy of the simple comparative models for which we previously characterized their accuracy and added-value  <cit> . to an existing target:template combination, another template of lower sequence identity is added. for example, template <dig>  is added to a target:template <dig> pair  such that s <dig> < s <dig>  the model of the target sequence based on template <dig>  is compared to that based on the combination of template1:template <dig>  to understand the effect of addition of the second template, template <dig>  any difference in the model quality in this experiment can be seen as a result of the variables described in eqn <dig> . the alignment of target:template <dig> may be different from that of target:template1:template <dig> and the observed change in the model quality could be due to the difference in the modeling alignment in the two situations. it could also be the case that the template1:template <dig> combination results in a template chimera that is structurally closer to the target than each of the individual templates  resulting in a better model without any changes to the alignments. it is also possible that a combination of both of the factors brings about changes in the model quality. in this study we seek to understand the contribution of structural complementarity in multiple template modeling. hence, we assess the accuracy of multiple template models to answer the following questions:  on average, are multiple-template models more accurate than their single-template counterparts?  what are the requirements to maximize the potential positive effect  of multiple templates on model accuracy? for clarity we answer these questions using the simplest case of multiple-template comparative model, namely two-template models.

RESULTS
research design
to facilitate the interpretation of the results the research design is described in this section.

structure-based target:template alignments are the most accurate ones for structure modeling. while these structure-based alignments do not represent an alignment that is achievable in real modeling cases  they are a useful benchmark representing error free alignments. at the other end of the spectrum we find pairwise sequence alignments, which rely only on the knowledge of the sequence of the target and the template. any difference in the quality of models based on these alignment types is solely due to differences in quality of the modeling alignment and has been the subject of our earlier study of single-template models  <cit> . str and seq alignments used here correspond to these baseline alignments and are used to study the influence of alignment accuracy on multiple-template modeling accuracy.

for convenience, seq and str single-template models in this study are named seq. <dig>  and str. <dig>  respectively  and the two-template models are named seq. <dig>  and str. <dig> . aln stands for alignment type seq or str; and x refers to number of template sequences used to generate the modeling alignment and y refers to number of template structures used in the actual modeling step after generating the modeling alignment. as discussed above , the difference between seq. <dig>  and seq. <dig>  can be a result of changes in the modeling alignment as well as structural complementarity of the first template by the second template . to eliminate contributions from alignment changes, thus focusing the analysis on structural complementarity, we use the seq. <dig>  models. the target sequence in seq. <dig>  is aligned simultaneously to two templates  but the modeling step involves only one template, i.e. template <dig>  . thus a model accuracy difference that arises due to structural complementarity of the templates will be revealed by the comparison of aln. <dig>  vs. aln. <dig>  models .

description of different types of models used to evaluate the contribution of the second template in structural complementarity in the context of varying alignment quality. t <dig> and t <dig> refer to template <dig> and template <dig> 

the relationship between alignment accuracy and model quality improvement due to structural complementarity is also examined i) indirectly by comparing structural complementarity in seq and str models, and ii) directly by evaluating the alignment accuracy of seq alignments. though the latter is the more rigorous comparison, we have deliberately carried out the analysis in both ways as the alignment accuracy is not a directly observable quantity in real modeling cases

throughout the study model accuracy is measured by root mean squared deviation  of the equivalent cα atoms between the modeled and experimental structure of the target sequence. since the data set has been designed such that coverage of all targets by the models is always 100%, there is no need to include coverage into the accuracy assessment .

two-template vs. one-template model accuracy
to identify accuracy improvements due to structural complementarity the seq. <dig>  models were analyzed . figure 3a shows that on average over all the cases the difference between seq. <dig>  and seq. <dig>  models is negligible. this suggests that, for the simple seq alignments, in most cases there is no average gain in model accuracy from structural complementarity. in fact, the distributions of Δrmsd between seq <dig>  and seq. <dig>  models showed that structural complementarity can be observed in only a small fraction of seq models . while the number of seq cases showing structural complementarity is too small to be visible in the average accuracy curves  it is interesting to determine what factors contribute to it.

structural complementarity vs. alignment accuracy
to determine whether the apparent lack of structural complementarity observed in seq models is caused by errors in the alignment, two tests were carried out. first, the set of one-template and two-template models based on structural alignments were analyzed  to measure structural complementarity in the absence of alignment errors. second, a direct comparison of alignment accuracy and structural complementarity in seq model was carried out. the comparison of str models shows that two-template models are more accurate than one-template models . the comparison of the average accuracy of str. <dig>  models with models based on ideal template chimeras, which represent a perfect two-template model , showed no difference  indicating that the fact that the increase in model accuracy is small and is not a consequence of limitations in the modeling approach. the distribution of Δrmsd between str. <dig>  and str. <dig>  models  shows that in ~80% of the cases there is no model improvement upon addition of the second template, in a small fraction of cases  there is minimal deterioration of the models, and in ~14% of cases improvement of the model accuracy is observed. in the most favorable cases this improvement can reach up to  <dig> Å rmsd , which is relatively large for changes that are not related to the alignment. as previously mentioned this improvement is a consequence of structural complementarity, thus suggesting that structural complementarity can more readily be observed in the context of highly accurate alignments.

to further explore the relationship between structural complementarity and alignment quality, the accuracy of seq alignments was measured by comparing them with the corresponding str alignment . a plot of Δrmsdaln  as a function of alignment accuracy  confirms that the amount of structural complementarity is dependent on alignment accuracy. the drop in absolute structural complementarity at very high alignment accuracy  is explained by the fact that the maximum possible structural complementarity  decreases with increasing alignment accuracy since the similarity between the two template structures also increases. this is evidenced by the measurement of Δrmsd between str. <dig>  and str. <dig>  for the str models corresponding to every pair of seq. <dig>  and seq. <dig>  models within an alignment accuracy bin . the difference between the maximal structural complementarity, Δrmsdstr = , and the observed structural complementarity in seq models, Δrmsdseq = , clearly correlates with alignment accuracy .

these results, together with those in the previous section, indicate that the positive effect of structural complementarity on the average accuracy of multiple template models can only be obtained when the modeling alignment is highly accurate. the fact that an accurate alignment is necessary to obtain structural complementarity is not surprising. the regions of the templates that are more likely to complement each other are the less conserved regions, which will also contain the most alignment errors. if the complementary regions are not correctly aligned the benefits of the structural information are lost. this same interplay between alignment errors and structural information also affects loop modeling  <cit> , where a good model building protocol may be limited by anchor residues that are inaccurate due to alignment errors. since insertions tend to occur more frequently in less conserved regions the anchor residues for loop modeling will tend to be aligned less accurately than other regions of the protein. these results once again stress how crucial the alignment quality is in comparative modeling and show that the benefits of a more accurate alignment are amplified in the case of multiple-template modeling by the additional accuracy gains from structural complementarity. thus, these results suggest that iterative approaches that combine alignment improvement or selection with explicit model building and evaluation may particularly benefit from the use of multiple templates  <cit> . the alignment improvement signal would only be strengthened by the additional increase in accuracy due to structural complementarity, once the alignment accuracy reaches a certain level.

template combinations resulting in improved model accuracy
with the aim of determining if the two-template modeling cases that show the largest accuracy improvement with respect to their one-template counterparts share any common attributes, the model accuracy improvement  was measured as a function of the sequence similarity between target and templates  and the sequence similarity between the two templates  . figure 5b shows the change in model accuracy improvement  as a function of the difference between s <dig> and s <dig>  it is observed that the two-template models  tend to be more accurate than the one-template models  when s <dig> is similar to s <dig>  this effect is only observed at relatively low target:template sequence identities . however, no deterioration of the models is observed when s <dig> is very different from s <dig>  thus, having templates that are equidistant from the target in terms of sequence similarity appears to be beneficial for template complementarity. a trivial way of assuring that s <dig> is similar to s <dig> is to select two templates that are very similar to each other . this of course would not result in an improved two-template model because two templates that are nearly identical will in practice function as a single template . hence, the influence of s <dig> on the accuracy of two-template models needed to be measured in the context of cases where s <dig> and s <dig> are very similar . both in the case of seq models and str models the maximal improvement was observed when s <dig> is very low  and the effect slightly decreases as s <dig> increases . hence, when the templates are not only equidistant from the target but also share low sequence similarity between them the accuracy improvement of the two-template model with respect to the one-template model is maximized. one can broadly say that a symmetrical combination  would show a high potential for improvement when s <dig> is less than 30%.

model improvement vs. model deterioration
if we define models that improve their accuracy upon addition of the second template by more than  <dig> Å rmsd as "good" and models that decrease their accuracy by more than  <dig> Å rmsd as "bad". for a given template selection criterion, we measure the ratio between the number of "good" and "bad" models. models for which the change in accuracy is less than  <dig> Å rmsd are ignored. as mentioned above, the sequence similarity between the two templates  is in a way a measure of the potential for complementarity between them. for example, if the two templates share very high similarity, there is little chance that they can complement each other, effectively functioning as a single template. on the other hand, if the two templates are very different from each other it may be difficult to find common alignable elements to transit from the use of one template to the other. figure 6a shows the change in the ratio of good to bad models as a function of s <dig>  for str models the ratio of good to bad models shows consistent growth when s <dig> falls below 30% and reaching values above  <dig> when s <dig> is below 15%. a more direct way of measuring the potential complementarity between the templates is to use the structural similarity between them instead of  the sequence similarity s <dig>  figure 6b shows the change in the ratio of good to bad models as a function of the cα rmsd between template <dig> and template <dig>  in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> Å rmsd a ratio of  <dig> times more good models than bad models  is observed for str models. at low sequence identity the correlation between sequence and structural similarity is not strong  <cit> , thus it is possible that s <dig> and rmsd between the templates are complementary to each other as measures to select optimal template combinations. to explore this possibility the ratio of good to bad models was plotted as a function of the rmsd between the templates, but only for the models where s <dig> is below 30% . for str models a large increase in the ratio was observed  with values above  <dig> in the range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å rmsd and a peak value of  <dig> at  <dig>  Å rmsd.

selection of optimal template combinations
the results shown above suggest a strategy for choosing templates for two-template modeling. template pairs should be selected such that  < 5%, s <dig> < 30%, and the rmsd between the templates is in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  Å. if these selection criteria are applied to our complete set of str models we observe that  <dig> % of the selected two-template models show no significant change with respect to the one-template model,  <dig> % show deterioration, and  <dig> % show improvement . the ratio of good to bad models improves from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when compared with the unfiltered set . this ratio corresponds to a  <dig> % chance of obtaining a more accurate model vs. obtaining a less accurate one. these template selection rules can be particularly useful in the context of large-scale automated modeling  <cit>  and in the context of structural genomics target ranking  <cit> . as structural genomics aims to provide enough experimental protein structures to accurately model the remaining proteins by comparative modeling it will be important to include considerations about the effect that structural complementarity of different structural genomics targets will have on the accuracy of the resulting models. the selection rule can help to guide the choice of the next template for structure determination in a family of domains. for example, in a hypothetical protein family with  <dig> members out of which only  <dig> have known structures, the choice of the member out of the remaining  <dig> sequences whose structure is to be determined next can be guided by the s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> relationship, such that the structure of the 4th member will enhance the modeling accuracy of most of the remaining  <dig> members by using multiple template models.

it is encouraging to notice that template combinations that fall into the "preferred" range  show a high probability of resulting in improved model accuracy. in the case of sequence-based alignments this benefit is less pronounced because of the low alignment accuracy. however, in structure-based alignments the effect of selecting optimal template combinations is significant and suggests that if accurate alignments can be achieved the model accuracy gains from template complementarity can be substantial. this is further supported by revisiting the relationship between structural complementarity and alignment accuracy for this subset of optimal template combinations . the absolute structural complementarity obtained at equivalent alignment accuracies is higher in the optimal subset set as compared to the complete set  as a consequence of the higher potential for complementarity of the optimal subset. the overall relationship between maximal structural complementarity Δrmsdstr = , and the observed structural complementarity in seq models, Δrmsdseq = , is not only maintained in the optimal subset  but shows a more rapid tendency to improve model quality with increase in alignment accuracy. the selection of optimal template combinations in the str case is quite robust, with only a very small chance of deteriorating the model as a consequence of adding a second template. the maximum accuracy gains are obtained at low target:template sequence identities which is where most of the modeling cases fall  <cit> . this is also the range where the most effort in model improvement is required  <cit> , and where the models are most informative compared to their templates  <cit> . thus, given that target:template alignment methods continue to improve, it is expected that the benefit of structural complementarity in multiple template modeling will also increase. the magnitude of the potential improvements  is quite significant compared to what the best refinement methods can obtain in some selected cases  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this large-scale  comprehensive analysis of multiple-template models explain the previous contradictory examples of improvement and deterioration of model quality on inclusion of additional templates  <cit> . both situations are possible. combinations of templates with s <dig> ≅ s <dig>  s <dig> < 30%, s <dig> < 30%, and template rmsd  <dig> – <dig>  Å show a high probability of improved model accuracy over the single-template model, while most remaining combinations tend to deteriorate the model. since most modeling cases fall in the sequence identity range below 30%, our results enable judicious choice of additional templates  to improve model accuracy. while structural complementarity does not contribute significantly to the average accuracy of simple seq models, its role increases as the accuracy of the modeling alignment increases as illustrated by the high accuracy seq alignments and the str alignments. since template selection is a fundamental step in comparative modeling, and the selection criteria described here are independent of the model building strategy used, the results of our analysis are relevant to any multiple-template modeling case irrespective of the software used. furthermore, the pre-screening of templates with increased potential for complementarity could prove beneficial in the context of modeling methods that attempt to identify good template combinations through model evaluation by decreasing the size of the search space  <cit> . the potential improvements obtained from a judicious template selection are also complementary to other approaches for improving model accuracy such as loop modeling  <cit>  and general refinement  <cit> . because our study is limited to two-template models and fixed alignments it is not representative of the expected model accuracy improvements that could be obtained by using larger numbers of templates and applying simultaneous alignment optimization. however, our results provide a clean description of the underlying relationships between alignment accuracy, template similarity, and model accuracy.
