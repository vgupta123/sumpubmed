BACKGROUND
verticillium species are wide-spread soil-borne fungi which cause vascular diseases in many plant species and are responsible for devastating diseases for plants that can thwart agricultural production. the vascular wilt fungus verticillium dahliae , for instance, infects more than  <dig> plant species, among them agriculturally and horticulturally important crops and ornamental plants  <cit> . it is estimated that vd infections are responsible for several billions of dollars of annual crop losses worldwide. vd has a broad host range and infects plants from temperate to subtropical climates  <cit> . because of their complex life style of the verticillium species, their control by classical pesticides or fungicides is difficult; therefore, the isolation of verticillium-resistant cultivars is an important task for the breeders .

genetic resistance against verticillium wilt diseases has been reported for several plant species  <cit> . the ve gene provides resistance against race  <dig> isolates of vd in tomato  <cit>  and the tomato gene is also functional after expression in arabidopsis  <cit> . many studies have used arabidopsis for the isolation of vd-resistant germplasm  <cit>  or the identification of novel resistance traits following mutagenesis  <cit> . furthermore, quite recently, a large number of proteins and metabolites from different organisms as well as phytohormones have been described to be involved in establishing partial resistance against verticillium wilt  <cit> .

like other verticillium species, vd can overwinter as mycelium in host plants or soil. the fungus can also form seed-like structures called microsclerotia, long-lived survival structures of clusters of melanized cells with thick walls, which survive in the soil without a host plant or in association with plant material for up to 20 years  <cit> . the microsclerotia germinate in response to stimuli from root exudates  <cit> . the hyphae penetrate and grow inter- and intracellularly through the root cortex toward the central cylinder of the root  <cit> . they enter the xylem cells of the root, from where they colonize the xylem of the hypocotyl and leaves. ultimately, the water transport is disrupted which results in the wilt phenotype  <cit> . verticillium species are considered as hemibiotroph: a biotrophic phase within root xylem without a visible disease phenotype is followed by a necrotrophic phase in the aerial parts of the plant.

the spread of the pathogen occurs primarily by root infections from the soil. therefore rhizosphere bacterial strains such as pseudomonas putida b e <dig>  pseudomonas chlororaphis k <dig> or serratia plymuthica r <dig>  <cit>  or bacterial isolates  <cit>  have been shown to function as efficient biocontrol agents against vd spread. the microbial bioagents induce antibiosis, parasitism, competition and secretion of enzymes such as glucose oxidase, chitinase and glucanase which results in the induction of disease resistance in the hosts  <cit> .

to our knowledge, there is no report on endophytic fungi which can be used as biocontrol agent against vd in arabidopsis. piriformospora indica , a cultivable basidiomycete of sebacinales, colonizes the roots of many plant species including arabidopsis  <cit> . like other members of sebacinales, pi is found worldwide in association with roots  <cit>  and stimulates growth, biomass and seed production of the hosts  <cit> . the fungus promotes nitrate and phosphate uptake and metabolism  <cit> . pi also confers resistance against abiotic  <cit>  and biotic stress  <cit> .

here, we demonstrate that pi is an efficient biocontrol agent that protects arabidopsis from vd infection in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting growth of vd in roots. furthermore, we give evidence that a vd-exudate compound induces cytoplasmic ca2+  elevation and the vd-disease development is dependent on the ethylene-activated transcription factor ein <dig> 

RESULTS
pi inhibits growth of vd on pda agar plates
pi and vd were co-cultivated as described in methods on a pda agar plate for 3 weeks. figure  <dig> demonstrates that pi strongly inhibits growth of vd hyphae. the vd colony in the dual culture is significantly smaller than the vd colony growing without pi. furthermore, the number of microsclerotia produced by vd in the dual culture is less than the number of microsclerotia produced by vd growing alone. no obvious inhibition zone can be detected. in contrast, growth of pi is barely affected by the presence of vd. this prompted us to test the role of pi in protecting arabidopsis plants against vd infection.figure  <dig>

arabidopsis seedlings pretreated with pi are protected against vd infection
to investigate whether pi can protect arabidopsis for vd infection, we exposed the seedlings first to pi prior to vd infection. seedlings not exposed to any of the two fungi or to one of the two fungi alone served as controls . the performance of the seedlings was measured after  <dig>   <dig> and 21 days, by visible inspection and measuring the fresh weights. after 10 days of co-cultivation, seedlings treated with vd or pi alone showed ~30% increase in the biomass compared to the untreated control seedlings. a comparable increase in the biomass was observed when the seedlings were first exposed to pi and then to vd or vice versa . this slight increase in the biomass suggests that both fungi initially form a beneficial interaction with the seedlings, and is consistent with the idea that this phase represents a biotrophic interaction of vd with arabidopsis roots. on the 14th day, seedlings infected by vd alone or first with vd followed by pi  showed obviously the disease symptoms. the leaves of these seedlings became paler and the roots browner compared to the seedlings exposed to pi or 1p2v treatments, although no significant differences in the biomass were observed for the different fungal treatments, except for pi treatment . in contrast, on the 21st day, seedlings exposed to vd alone or exposed to vd prior to exposure to pi  were severely damaged. their fresh weights were reduced or no longer measurable. pi treatment alone resulted in a ~30% increase in the fresh weight . interestingly, seedlings which were pretreated with pi and then exposed to vd  had the same fresh weights as untreated control seedlings, although the visible inspection showed some photo-bleaching . this clearly demonstrates that pi protects arabidopsis seedlings against vd-induced wilt. therefore, this experimental set-up was used to study the protective function of pi in greater details.figure  <dig>

the results were confirmed by calculating the percentage disease index  for those seedlings treated with vd. after 10 days of co-cultivation, the pdi for vd and 1v2p seedlings was ~20%, and after 14 days 40-50%. after 21 days, the pdi was almost 100%. in contrast, seedlings pretreated with pi prior to exposure to vd  showed a slow increase in the pdi, which reached ~30% after 21 days .

furthermore, the amount of total chlorophyll  is a sensitive marker for the fitness of a plant. on the 4th day, the shoots of vd- and pi- treated plants contained slightly higher chl levels than control seedlings . on the 10th day, the chl content of vd- treated seedlings is comparable to that of control seedlings not exposed to the pathogen. furthermore, while 1p2v seedlings had the same amount of chl as pi seedlings, the chl content in 1v2p seedlings was significantly reduced . comparable results were obtained for the 14th day, except that the chl content for 1p2v seedlings was reduced compared to pi seedlings . on the 21st day, pi seedlings had the highest chl content, 1p2v seedlings had the same amount of chl as control seedlings not exposed to a fungus, while the chl levels in the vd and 1v2p plants were strongly decreased . this confirms the protective function of pi against vd infection in arabidopsis leaves.figure  <dig>

pathogenesis and application of pathogen-associated molecular patterns induce stomata closure  <cit> . in control plants not exposed to any fungus, between  <dig> and 12% of the stomata were closed. three days after exposure of the roots to vd, ~25% of the stomata were closed , and this increased to ~30% until the 7th day. the 1v2p treatment showed ~25% stomata closure at the 7th day, and this value is comparable to that for seedlings treated with vd alone. in contrast, exposure of the roots to pi or first to pi followed by vd did not result in stomata closure and these values are comparable to those of the untreated controls . this indicates that pi prevents vd-induced stomata closure. these results demonstrate that stomatal closure correlates nicely with the amount of total chlorophyll.figure  <dig>

pi represses vd-induced genes in shoots
vd induces defense gene expression in shoots. after  <dig> d, the mrna levels for pr <dig> and pr <dig> representing sa-inducible genes and pdf <dig>  for the ja/et pathway, erf <dig> and vsp <dig> for et pathway were upregulated in the leaves of vd-exposed seedlings. except for pr <dig>  none of the other genes responded to pi exposure . after  <dig> d, vd-exposed seedlings showed an even stronger upregulation of the defense genes in the leaves . pretreatment of the seedlings with pi prior to vd infection resulted in the repression of defense gene expression compared to seedlings which were not pretreated with pi. this provides additional evidence for the protective function of pi against vd infection. furthermore, plant glutamate receptor-like  genes, glr <dig> , glr <dig>  and glr <dig>  code for putative ca2+ transporters and are involved in defense responses  <cit> . we observed that glr <dig>   was upregulated in the leaves of vd-exposed seedlings and repressed in the leaves of seedlings which were pretreated with pi prior to vd exposure . rabgap <dig> is required for defense to v. longisporum and contributes to stomata immunity  <cit> . for vd, rabgap <dig> is upregulated after exposure to vd and significantly repressed in seedlings which were pretreated with pi .figure  <dig>

pi strongly represses vd-induced phytohormone accumulation in shoots
the phytohormones ja, ja-ile, opda, sa, aba and et are crucial for the activation of defense responses. figure  <dig> demonstrates that these phytohormones accumulated after vd infection in the shoots of arabidopsis seedlings. the phytohormone levels were also high in the 1v2p samples, while in all other cases , they showed significantly lower levels. thus, vd-induced phytohormone accumulation is repressed if the roots are colonized by pi prior to their exposure to vd. interestingly, application of pi to roots which were already exposed to vd did not repress the accumulation of the phytohormones in the shoots.figure  <dig>

pi inhibits vd propagation and microsclerotia formation
quantification of the amount of vd dna demonstrated that vd and 1v2p seedlings contain twice as much pathogen dna than 1p2v seedlings in both roots  and shoots . interestingly, the amount of pi dna in the roots is identical in all pi-treated samples and not affected by a pretreatment with vd . furthermore, microscopic analysis demonstrated that the number of microsclerotia was strongly reduced in root tissue pretreated with pi . this demonstrates that pi inhibits vd propagation and microsclerotia formation in the roots, while vd does not affect the propagation of pi in arabidopsis roots.figure  <dig>

long-term experiments confirmed the results obtained for seedlings
in order to study long term interaction, the seedlings were grown according to the  <dig> regimes on petri dishes for 10 days before transferred to sterile vermiculite for additional 14 days. all  seedlings and those exposed to pi  were alive. exposure of pi-pretreated plants to vd resulted in ~20% loss of the plants. however 80% of the plants, which were either exposed to vd alone or first to vd followed by pi, died . furthermore, we measured the fresh weights of the seedlings which survived the treatments. plants exposed to pi alone showed a ~30% increase in the fresh weight. the fresh weights of 1p2v plants were comparable to those not exposed to any fungus. vd- and 1v2p-treated seedlings showed significantly decreased fresh weights compared to all other treatments . finally, the vd dna amount in both shoots and roots was lower in 1p2v-treated plants compared to those treated with vd alone or first with vd followed by pi  . comparable to the results obtained with seedlings in petri dishes , the pi dna content was the same in all pi-treated roots . this confirms that pi inhibits vd growth, but not vice versa.figure  <dig>

the strong upregulation of the phytohormone levels in the leaves of seedlings grown in the presence of vd was further investigated for et. pantelides et al.  <cit>  have shown that et perception via etr <dig> is required for vd infection in arabidopsis. we observed a strong requirement of ein <dig> for vd-induced disease development in arabidopsis leaves. ein <dig> seedlings which were exposed to vd alone or were first treated with vd before application of pi perform better than wild-type seedlings . interestingly, the et level in ein <dig> seedlings is much higher than in wild-type seedlings, even in the absence of vd. exposure of the seedlings to vd stimulate et accumulation even further . this suggests that ein <dig> seedlings try to compensate the lack of ein3-induced genes by further stimulating et biosynthesis, in particular after vd infection. taken together, these data demonstrate that ein3-induced genes are required for pathogenicity of vd.figure  <dig>

vd induces cyt elevation in wt roots, but not in roots of a ca2+ response mutant
pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity is often initiated by cyt elevation, which can be induced by exudated compounds from pathogenic fungi . since the putative plasma membrane-localized ca2+-transporter gene glr <dig>  was upregulated by vd, we tested whether exudated compounds from vd can induce cyt elevation in roots. an exudate preparation from the mycelium was applied to the roots of transgenic pmaq <dig> arabidopsis lines expressing the ca2+-sensor apoaequorin. under resting conditions,  <dig> d-old pmaq <dig> lines gave cyt values of 70 ±  <dig>  nm . a rapid and transient increase in the cyt concentration is observed 40 sec after the application of vd preparation . discharge at the end of the experiment demonstrates that less than 5% of the reconstituted aequorin was consumed after the stimuli, which ensures that the amount of aequorin in the sample is not limiting for the ca2+ signal . the cyt reached a peak of ~  <dig> nm after  <dig> to 120 sec . subsequently the ca2+ levels steadily decreased. no cyt elevation is observed with the pbs buffer treatment . the magnitude of the cyt response is dose-dependent . furthermore, an arabidopsis cytoplasmic calcium elevation mutant <dig>  which does not show cyt elevation in response to exudate preparation from various pathogenic fungi  <cit>  also failed to induce cyt elevation in response to the vd preparation . this indicates that cycam <dig> is impaired in the response to exudate preparations from various pathogens. furthermore, we crossed the apoaeqorin gene into the glr <dig> , glr <dig>  and glr <dig>  knock-out background. figure 11b demonstrates that the vd exudate preparation induced cyt elevation in the knock-out backgrounds, indicating that these putative plasma membrane-localized transporters do not participate in the ca2+ uptake from the extracellular space, although the gene glr <dig>  was upregulated in vd-infected seedlings .figure  <dig>

vd exudate preparation does not induce cyt elevation in the cycam <dig> mutant, but induces cyt elevation in pmaq <dig> lines in the glr <dig> , glr <dig>  and glr <dig>  background.



to investigate whether cyt elevation is required for disease development, cycam <dig> was infected with vd and the development of the mutant seedlings was compared to that of the wt seedlings. no obvious difference of the disease symptoms in the aerial parts could be detected, which suggests that cyt elevation is not essential for vd propagation .

discussion
our data demonstrate that pi is a very efficient biocontrol agent for vd wilt in arabidopsis. pi restricts vd growth both on agar plates  and in arabidopsis roots, in particular when they were first colonized by pi prior to infection with vd . molecular and biochemical analyses demonstrate that the reduced growth rate of vd in pi-pretreated arabidopsis roots retards defense gene expression , the accumulation of defense-related phytohormones  and stomata closure . the performance of the seedlings is significantly better  and this also continues after shifting the seedlings to vermiculite for a longer period of time . pi not only inhibits growth of vd mycelia in arabidopsis roots, but also prevents the spread of the pathogen to the aerial parts of the plant . furthermore, microsclerotia formation is strongly reduced . previously, several soil-borne bacteria have been identified as biocontrol agents for verticillium wilt  <cit> . vd can induce antimicrobial metabolites such as rutin in potato  <cit>  or pathogenesis-related proteins in arabidopsis  <cit>  which participates in pathogen resistance. prieto et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that root hair colonization plays an important role in pseudomonas spp.-mediated biocontrol activity against verticillium wilt in olive roots. furthermore, the bacillus subtilis strain ncd- <dig> functions as a biocontrol agent against cotton verticillium wilt, and the cotton phor/phop, two component regulatory systems, were involved in the biocontrol capability of the bacterium  <cit> . also quorum sensing is involved in the biocontrol activity of serratia plymuthica against vd  <cit> . moderate drought influences the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as biocontrol agents against verticillium-induced wilt in pepper  <cit> . it appears that quite different mechanisms control the fungal spread, probably because of the complicated lifestyle of the pathogen which allows microbial interference at different levels and in different plant tissues.

an increasing number of genes were recently identified to be involved in establishing partial resistance to verticillium wilts . pathogen attack including root colonization by vd is associated with stomata closure as one of the first line of plant defense . rabgap <dig> is required for defense against v. longisporum and contributes to stomatal immunity  <cit> . rabgap <dig> gene is upregulated by vd and repressed by pi . finally, defensins play a role in the plant defense against vd  <cit> .

control of microsclerotia formation is crucial for preventing verticillium spread in nature and agriculture. our data demonstrate that pi is quite efficient in restricting microsclerotia formation in arabidopsis roots , presumable because the pathogen cannot grow fast enough in the presence of pi. microsclerotia formation is also suppressed by verticillium itself, i.e. by the fungal transcription activator of adhesion vta <dig>  and fungi impaired in vta <dig> are unable to colonize plants and induces disease symptoms  <cit> . taken together, pi restricts vd growth as well as hyphal and microslerotia propagation, which - in turn - causes that the plant defense processes get activated at a lower level compared to vd treatments which might depend on pi-plant-vd interaction-pattern and the attack strategy of vd. this is not only important for better performance of individual plants, but has also severe long-term consequences for the control of the vd spread via microsclerotia in ecosystems and agricultural areas.

grl homologs are associated with ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. figure  <dig> demonstrates that the mrna level for glr <dig>  is upregulated in the leaves of vd-infected arabidopsis seedlings and these responses are restricted by a pretreatment of the seedlings with pi. glr <dig>  is involved in plant defense and resistance to hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit> . the protein also mediates glutathione-triggered cyt transients, transcriptional changes, and innate immunity responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . glr <dig>  is upregulated in arabidopsis cell cultures upon wounding  <cit>  and glr <dig>  is induced by nematodes in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . glr <dig> , also called augmin subunit  <dig>  is a microtubule plus-end binding protein that promotes microtubule reorientation in hypocotyls  <cit> . microtubules and microtubule orientation are important for plant defense and immunity  <cit>  and also involved in vd-arabidopsis interaction. hu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that histone h2b monoubiquitination is involved in regulating the dynamics of microtubules during the defense response to vd toxins in arabidopsis. yuan et al.  <cit>  showed that vd toxins disrupted microfilaments and microtubules in arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells. figure 11a shows that exudate compounds from vd induces cyt elevation in arabidopsis roots. in order to test whether the cyt elevation is mediated by one of the three glrs, we generated transgenic glr <dig> , glr <dig>  and glr <dig>  knock-out lines in the apoaequorin background and found that the cyt response is not controlled by the three glrs , although the mrna level of glr <dig>  is upregulated upon vd infection . this suggests that glrs have different functions in the vd-arabidopsis interaction. however, an ethylmethansulfonate-induced arabidopsis mutant named cycam <dig> which is unable to induce cyt elevation in response to exudate preparations from alternaria brassicae, rhizoctonia solani, phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae and agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit>  did not respond to the vd exudate preparation . this demonstrates that at least one of the vd-induced signaling events leading the opening of ca2+ channels or the channels themselves are identical to those responding to exudate preparations from other pathogens  <cit> . however, the reduced ca2+ response in the cycam <dig> mutant does not affect the disease development. it remains to be determined which is the active compound inducing the cyt response in arabidopsis roots, and what is the mutated gene in the cycam <dig> mutant.

several exudated compounds have been postulated to induce pathogenicity in plants. klosterman et al.  <cit>  proposed that based on the sequence information of verticillium species, pathogenicity may be caused by a cocktail of different compounds and elicitors with different functions in the complex pathogenicity procedure. a verticillium crude toxin preparation has been often used, although the exact composition of this preparation and the role of the individual compounds are not clear. for instance, recently yao et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that the vd toxin preparation stimulates nitric oxide production in arabidopsis which serves as a signaling intermediate downstream of h2o <dig> to modulate dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton. this may link the vd toxin function again to glr <dig> , who’s mrna level is upregulated after vd infection . wang et al.  <cit>  reported on the purification and characterization of a novel hypersensitive-like response-inducible protein elicitor named pevd <dig> from vd that induces resistance responses in tobacco. the relationship of the bioactive compound that induces the cyt response to the toxins which induce disease responses needs to be investigated.

interestingly, we did not observe a linear relationship between the propagation of vd in the seedlings and the accumulation of defense-related phytohormone levels. for instance, the phytohormone levels were always high when the seedlings were exposed to vd, irrespective of whether they were exposed to vd alone, pretreated with pi or first with vd followed by pi , although, growth of vd was strongly reduced by the pi pretreatment . this suggests that even low infection rates of vd are sufficient to stimulate the accumulation of the defense hormones. this might be a precaution, although propagation of vd is inhibited when the roots were pretreated with pi.

various reports showed the involvement of plant hormones in the control of verticillium growth in arabidopsis. stabilization of cytokinin levels enhances arabidopsis resistance against v. longisporum  <cit> . the fungus also requires ja-dependent coi <dig> function in roots to elicit disease symptoms in arabidopsis shoots  <cit> . ethylene perception via the receptor etr <dig> is required for vd infection in arabidopsis  <cit> . enhanced resistance of etr1- <dig> plants, but not of sa-, ja- or other et-deficient mutants against vd infection indicate a crucial role of etr <dig> in defense against this pathogen. we observed a particularly striking resistance of the arabidopsis ein <dig> mutant against vd infection in vivo and in vitro . this is consistent with the reports by pantelides et al.  <cit>  for etr <dig>  although they did not observe a significant role of ein <dig> in their studies. our data demonstrate that ein <dig> plays an important role in pathogenicity and will provide an important tool to identify ein3-regulated genes which are required for vd disease development. furthermore, the et level in the ein <dig> mutant exposed to vd is much higher compared to vd-exposed wt seedlings . this suggests a feedback loop by which the lack of ein3-induced defense responses in the ein <dig> mutant results in an additional stimulation of et synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data demonstrate that pi is a very efficient biocontrol agent for vd. this is mainly caused by the restriction of vd growth in the presence of pi. there appears to be additional mechanisms which prevent pathogenicity of vd in the presence of pi. for instance, the phytohormone levels accumulate to comparable levels in vd and 1p2v seedlings, although vd propagation is restricted in the presence of pi . since pi pretreatment severely reduces defense gene expression in spite of a comparable phytohormone level in these tissues, additional signals from pi must participate in the regulation of the immune response against vd.
