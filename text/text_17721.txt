BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional control of gene expression functions to regulate protein synthesis in a spatial and temporal manner, and involves the activity of an extensive array of rna-binding proteins. throughout the lifetime of an mrna, a dynamic association exists between mrnas and rna-binding proteins. these interactions are important in mediating mrna maturation events such as splicing, capping, polyadenylation and export from the nucleus  <cit> . rna-binding proteins also contribute to post-transcriptional regulatory events in the cytoplasm, such as mrna localization, mrna stability and decay, and translation. one group of rna-binding proteins that are important regulators of cytoplasmic post-transcriptional control is the puf family of proteins. puf proteins have extensive structural conservation within their rna binding domain and regulate a range of biological processes, including developmental patterning, stem cell control, and neuron function  <cit> .

the founding members of the puf family of proteins are pumilio in drosophila and fem- <dig> binding factor  in c. elegans  <cit> . puf protein diversity extends across kingdoms, as mammalian, fungal, protozoan and plant homologs have been identified  <cit> . the number of puf gene copies in each model organism is variable. for example, the drosophila, human, yeast, and c. elegans genomes encode one, two, six and eleven puf genes, respectively  <cit> . puf proteins are generally known to bind directly to sequence elements located within the 3' untranslated region  of their target mrnas. once bound, they interact with other proteins to inhibit translation or trigger mrna decay. for instance, drosophila pumilio represses the translation of hunchback  mrna in early embryo development through deadenylation dependent and independent mechanisms  <cit> . pumilio binds to a pair of  <dig> nucleotide nanos response elements  located within the 3'utr of the hunchback mrna. each nre contains two core elements , each of which interacts with one pumilio protein in a cooperative manner  <cit> . this interaction provides a platform for the recruitment of nanos  and brain tumor  proteins to repress the translation of hunchback mrna in the posterior region of the embryo.

the rna binding domain of puf proteins  forms a crescent-shaped structure that usually contains eight imperfect tandem puf repeats each consisting of approximately  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . each puf repeat is organized into three Î±-helices, the second of which provides a binding interface with the target rna. within each puf repeat, three conserved amino acid side chains are typically responsible for modular binding of the repeat to a single rna base using hydrogen bonds, van der waals, and base stacking interactions  <cit> . puf proteins often bind target transcripts that contain a conserved ugur  tetranucleotide motif flanked downstream by an au-rich sequence of four nucleotides. the modular binding of each puf repeat to an rna base is predictable based on the combination of specific amino acids that contact the watson-crick edge of the base  <cit> . this interaction, however, demonstrates considerable complexity and adaptability, as a wide range of rna sequences are recognized by each puf protein. for example, rna-immunoprecipitation profiling studies have shown that individual puf proteins can bind to hundreds of unique transcripts in vivo  <cit> . this suggests that that this family of proteins has important roles in regulating the stability and translation of numerous mrna targets across a broad range of organisms. these and other studies have shown that puf proteins can recognize rna sequences that extend beyond the canonical eight nucleotide length, and can bind to non-cognate sequences  <cit> . the identification of mrna targets of individual puf proteins has revealed that puf proteins typically bind to subsets of mrnas that are functionally or cytotopically related and located within macromolecular complexes. thus, related groups of mrnas may be coordinately regulated as 'post-transcriptional operons' or 'rna regulons'  <cit> . for example, yeast puf3p binds to motifs located in the 3'utr of numerous mrnas that encode mitochondrial proteins and regulates the stability, transport and translation of these transcripts  <cit> . the rna regulon model predicts that environmental cues result in a dynamic remodeling of rnp complexes to co-regulate mrnas in a combinatorial manner to serve various functional roles within the cell  <cit> .

plant puf proteins have been described only briefly in the literature, in the form of limited phylogenetic analyses  <cit> , and recently with the identification of putative mrna targets of arabidopsis puf proteins  <cit> . here, we discuss the evolutionary relationships of the complete set of puf proteins from the dicotyledonous plant arabidopsis thaliana  and the monocotyledonous plant oryza sativa , as well as members from a moss and algal species. we also describe three-dimensional structural modeling, and biochemical and cellular characteristics of selected members of this protein family. this work demonstrates that the plant pum-hd adopts the typical crescent shaped structure that is characteristic of this domain in other organisms, and that it possesses sequence specific rna binding activity in vitro. we provide evidence these plant puf proteins are packaged into common cytoplasmic particles that presumably have an evolutionary conserved role in the post-transcriptional control of a vast array of mrna targets.

RESULTS
identification and comparative analysis of plant puf proteins
blastp and tblastn searches of the arabidopsis and rice genome databases were conducted using the drosophila pumilio pum-hd amino acid sequence  as the query sequence. this search revealed that both the arabidopsis and rice genomes encode strikingly large puf gene families that include  <dig> and  <dig> putative members, respectively. a phylogenetic tree of the predicted arabidopsis and rice puf proteins was constructed based on the deduced amino acid sequence of their pum-hd coding sequence . also included in the phylogenetic tree were representative puf sequences from the moss physcomitrella patens, the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as drosophila pumilio and human pum <dig> 

the phylogentic tree identified several sub-families of proteins that were assigned into groups based on monophyly . group i was the most extensive of all groups, and contained at least one puf member from each of the species that were included in this analysis. this group corresponds to the 'pumilio cluster' of proteins that was categorized previously  <cit> . group ii contained plant, algal, and yeast proteins, whereas groups iii, iv, and v contained plant members only. a number of proteins are more divergent, and do not appear to belong to any of the major branches that were identified in this analysis . some arabidopsis and rice puf genes appear to be orthologs  as they demonstrate a high degree of sequence conservation in the pum-hd. additionally, two chlamydomonas proteins  also appear to be orthologs with plant puf proteins. gene expansion through tandem duplication is also evident from this analysis. atpum  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  are clustered in one region of chromosome  <dig>  and other tandemly located genes are also evident .

greater than half of the arabidopsis  and rice  puf proteins possess eight imperfect tandem puf repeats . this is consistent with the number of puf repeats present in most non-plant puf proteins, although examples of functional puf proteins with fewer than eight repeats have been identified  <cit> . the remaining arabidopsis and rice puf proteins lack one or more of these repeats, with some possessing only two or three obvious repeats. a number of core residues are uniquely conserved within each of the eight puf repeats, thereby allowing us to determine the identity of each repeat and whether a specific repeat is absent or truncated. crystallographic studies have demonstrated that the eight tandem puf repeats of the human pum-hd are flanked by two imperfect pseudorepeats   <cit> . regions resembling these pseudorepeats are present in several of the arabidopsis and rice proteins . puf proteins from other species often contain large regions of low complexity  <cit> . although isolated, short regions of repeated amino acids are observed in some arabidopsis and rice puf proteins, extensive stretches of low complexity sequence are not observed in these proteins. the tandemly positioned rice open reading frames , os04g <dig> and os04g <dig>  possess amino and carboxyl ends of the pum-hd, respectively . analysis of the genomic dna region that separates the two sequences identified a transposon that likely inserted within a full-length pum-hd from the ancestral puf protein. interestingly, there is cdna support for os04g <dig>  suggesting that the encoded protein is functional. although os04g <dig> and os04g <dig> are placed in different positions in the phylogenetic tree , os04g <dig> likely belongs, by association, with os04g <dig> in group i. placing os04g <dig> in clade with atpum <dig> is likely coincidental, as there is little conservation between these two sequences.

those arabidopsis and rice genes that were not supported by cdna sequences  were analyzed more extensively in an attempt to validate their predicted orfs. the presence of many closely related members within each of the arabidopsis and rice puf families allowed for sequence comparisons to provide a more confident assignment of orfs. notably, the orfs of atpum <dig> and atpum <dig> that were listed in the database appear to have incorrectly predicted introns. in the case of atpum <dig>  this resulted in the merger of an orf encoding a self-incompatibility protein with that of atpum <dig>  an incorrectly predicted intron in atpum <dig> was likely the result of a sequencing error. this predicted intron contained sequence that was almost identical to sequence within the orf of the intronless gene atpum <dig>  a close relative of atpum <dig>  based on this information, the primary structure line diagrams have been modified, with the removal of the self-incompatibility orf from atpum <dig>  and the intron from atpum <dig> .

the arabidopsis pum-hd with the highest amino acid sequence similarity to the human pum <dig> pum-hd is atpum <dig>  sharing 54% amino acid identity within this domain. the rice puf protein with the highest amino acid sequence identity to atpum <dig> is os01g <dig>  possessing 49% amino acid identity throughout the entire protein and 84% identity within the pum-hd. the atpum <dig> and os01g <dig> pum-hds were included in an amino acid sequence alignment with pum-hds from other plant and non-plant species, and this alignment demonstrated that extensive sequence conservation exists in each of the puf repeats . a comprehensive amino acid alignment of pum-hds comparing the arabidopsis and rice pum-hds with all of the p. patens, c. reinhardtii, s. cerevisiae, human and drosophila pum-hds demonstrated that the core of each repeat has a high degree of amino acid conservation across species . the p. patens genome contains  <dig> puf-like genes, whereas four puf-like genes are present in the c. reinhardtii genome.

crystallographic analysis of puf proteins from other species has determined that the amino acids at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> within each puf repeat provide the binding interface with rna bases using hydrogen bonds, van der waals, or stacking interactions  <cit> . surprisingly, alignment of these triplet amino acids in puf repeats from the arabidopsis and rice pum-hds demonstrated that there is complete conservation in some members and extensive variability in others . the amino acids at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from atpum <dig> through atpum <dig> are conserved with the corresponding triplets in human pum <dig> and drosophila pumilio . however, atpum <dig> through atpum <dig> possess a single amino acid substitution in several of these amino acid triplets, and atpum <dig> through atpum <dig> show extensive variability and are less easily predictable . the rice pum-hds showed less variability in these triplets, although uncommon triplet combinations were also evident. in some arabidopsis and rice pum-hds, amino acid substitutions in one puf repeat resulted in a triplet composition that is identical to that observed in a different puf repeat . for instance, repeat  <dig> in several of the arabidopsis and rice proteins possesses a cysteine at position  <dig> , resulting in an amino acid triplet that matches that of puf repeats  <dig> and  <dig> in the conserved proteins. interestingly, this crq triplet is also found in repeat  <dig> in some fungal and protozoan puf proteins  <cit> . several examples of unconventional triplets are present in the arabidopsis and rice puf repeats , some of which are present in puf repeats of other species as well   <cit> .

the regions of the arabidopsis and rice puf proteins that lie outside of the pum-hd are variable in primary sequence and length . these variable sequences are typically amino-terminal extensions of each protein, although carboxyl-terminal extensions of variable length are also present in several proteins. a pfam search http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ of the polypeptide regions lying outside of the pum-hd was performed in an attempt to identify significantly conserved domains that are present within the variable regions of the arabidopsis and rice puf proteins. atpum <dig> is the only arabidopsis or rice puf protein that possesses puf repeat sequences that reside outside of the conserved pum-hd region . additionally, the amino-terminal region of several related arabidopsis and rice proteins within group i  possess a motif that resembles a nucleic acid binding protein domain . finally, the rice protein os08g <dig> possesses two regions in its amino terminal extension that are similar to versions of a 'domain of unknown function' , a region found in some leucine zipper proteins  <cit> .

to gain insight into the expression pattern of the arabidopsis puf genes in different tissues and in response to various environmental stimuli, the transcription profiles for these genes were extracted from the microarray database  <cit> . some overlap exists in the tissues/organs that exhibit maximal expression between arabidopsis puf genes, particularly those genes that are closely related . each of the puf genes showed a significant change in expression pattern in response to at least one abiotic or biotic stimulus. extensive variability exists in the type of response to these stimuli, even between genes that are closely related .

three-dimensional models of plant pum-hds
a homology modeling approach was used to gain insight into whether plant pum-hds adopt the typical crescent shaped three-dimensional structure similar to that of the pum-hds from human, drosophila and yeast puf proteins. the three-dimensional models of the atpum <dig> and os01g <dig> pum-hds bound to boxb of the hunchback mrna nre <dig> were constructed using the crystal structure of the pum-hd from human pum <dig> bound to the nre <dig> rna  as a template for homology modeling. this structure was determined at  <dig>  Ã resolution and provides the most reliable template currently available for modeling the nature of protein:rna interactions from plant pum-hds. notably, only interactions between puf repeats  <dig> to  <dig> and the bound rna could be modeled, since the rna templates for the complexes determined at high resolution only included residues  <dig> to  <dig> of box b from nre <dig> .

the homology models of the atpum <dig> and os01g <dig> pum-hd bound to the nre <dig> indicate that plant pum-hds can form interactions with rna in a manner similar to that observed in the human pum-hd:rna complexes . the conserved amino acid triplets at position  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of each repeat in atpum <dig> and os01g <dig>  form interactions with rna bases in the modeled structure . most of the hydrogen bonds and van der waals contacts formed by amino acids at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the human pum-hd:rna crystal structures  <cit>  are also observed in the models of the plant pum-hd:rna complexes . the stacking interactions between residues at position  <dig> and adjacent bases are also conserved. in addition to similarities in the structures of the puf repeats, the homology models also indicate that a region lying between the seventh and eighth puf repeats can form an extended loop structure on the convex surface of the domain , similar to that observed in the human and drosophila pum-hd proteins. in drosophila, this loop interacts with the translational co-repressors nos and brat  <cit> .

a similar approach was used to model the structure of the pum-hd of atpum <dig>  a puf protein that varies significantly in the identity of puf repeat amino acid residues at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the homology model for the atpum <dig> pum-hd:rna complex indicates that interactions between puf repeats  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with the highly conserved ugu sequence at the centre of box b are conserved in atpum <dig> and os01g <dig> . however, the model also shows that the remaining atpum <dig> puf repeats fail to form many of the stacking interactions and hydrogen bond interactions that are observed in atpum <dig> and os01g <dig>  as a result, we predict that the binding affinity of atpum <dig> for the nre <dig> is lower than that of atpum <dig>  and atpum <dig> may prefer rna targets that are different from the nre <dig> outside of the ugu core. it is also interesting to note that the atpum <dig> model reveals the presence of extended loops on the convex surface of the protein between puf repeats  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as repeats  <dig> and  <dig> .

atpum <dig> pum-hd binds with specificity to the hunchback nre1
to determine if the atpum <dig> pum-hd binds rna as is predicted by structural modeling, electrophoresis mobility shift assays  were performed. two synthetic 19-nucleotide rnas were used in these assays. the first was a wildtype nanos response element  that matched a region from boxb of the hunchback nre <dig> . this rna oligonucleotide  was identical in sequence to one used in a previous study that analyzed the binding affinity of the human pum-hd to rna  <cit> . the second rna oligonucleotide was a variant form of the nre <dig>  that contained a single nucleotide change in the highly conserved core of the puf repeat binding site . this mutant nre <dig> was shown to have approximately 100-fold reduced affinity for the human pum-hd  <cit> . the emsa experiments demonstrated that the atpum <dig> pum-hd bound effectively to the wildtype nre <dig>  whereas binding to the mutant nre <dig> was significantly lower . competition assays were performed to further demonstrate the specificity of the atpum <dig> pum-hd interaction with wildtype nre <dig>  the addition of 100-fold excess concentration of cold mutant nre <dig> competitor to the assay mixture only slightly reduced the binding of wildtype nre <dig> to the atpum <dig> pum-hd, whereas the addition of excess cold wildtype nre <dig> competitor completely eliminated any detectable interaction between the protein and the mutant nre <dig> .

emsa titration experiments were conducted to determine the binding affinity of the atpum <dig> pum-hd to the wildtype and mutant nre <dig>  the atpum <dig> pum-hd bound to wildtype nre with an apparent dissociation constant of  <dig>  nm . this value is >10-fold higher than was observed for drosophila pumilio pum-hd binding to the nre <dig> , but within the range observed for other puf protein interactions with their cognate rnas  <cit> . the binding affinity of the protein to the mutant nre <dig> was significantly lower than to wildtype rna . although a protein-mutant nre <dig> complex was apparent at an atpum <dig> pum-hd concentration of  <dig>  nm, the interaction remained weak at a protein concentration of  <dig> nm, as seen by the diffuse nature of the shifted band. however, only a small amount of free rna was present in the  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm samples, indicating that the low affinity binding of the atpum-hd to the rna resulted in a dissociation of the complex during electrophoresis. thus, the instability of the complex did not allow for an accurate determination of the dissociation constant. however, based on the amount of free rna in each lane, the dissociation constant value for the protein bound to mutant nre <dig> appears in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> nm.

arabidopsis puf proteins typically localize to dynamic, punctate cytoplasmic structures
to provide insight into the subcellular localization patterns of the arabidopsis puf proteins, several of these proteins were transiently expressed as fusions to the amino-terminus of either gfp or rfp in onion or fava bean epidermal cells. in total, nine atpum proteins were successfully expressed as fluorescent protein fusions. seven of the fusion proteins localized to cytoplasmic structures that were visible as puncta  <dig>  microns or less in diameter . however, large protein aggregates were occasionally observed in some cells, likely resulting from higher levels of expression of the fusion protein . in epidermal cells that demonstrated active cytoplasmic streaming, the fluorescent particles were occasionally dynamic, demonstrating stop-and-go movements that reached peak velocities of up to five microns/second . particle movement ceased when cells were treated with the actin destabilizing agent, latrunculin b , indicating that the actin cytoskeleton was responsible for driving particle movement. the microtubule disrupting agent, oryzalin, did not noticeably affect the movement of the atpum containing particles . in addition to punctate cytoplasmic staining, strong nuclear fluorescence was often observed, and was more prevalent in cells expressing specific fluorescent protein fusions . this observation suggested that some fusion proteins shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. nuclear localization and export may be common features for most of the atpum proteins, as  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins have a predicted leucine-rich nuclear export signal  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netnes/, with atpum <dig> and atpum <dig> as exceptions. the predicted nes sequences are located in the variable amino terminal region of each protein, which in several atpum proteins is extremely short . nes-containing proteins are dependent on crm <dig>  for export from the nucleus  <cit> , and are sensitive to export inhibition by leptomycin b. epidermal cells expressing each of the cytoplasmic, punctate atpum fluorescent protein fusions shown in figures 9a through 9g were treated with leptomycin b. we observed that all but one fusion protein  demonstrated an accumulation of fluorescent signal in the nucleus after treatment with leptomycin b . this indicated that atpum proteins shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via a crm- <dig> mediated pathway.

two atpum-fluorescent fusion proteins  had a different subcellular localization pattern from the others, demonstrating only nuclear fluorescence that was enriched within nucleolar-like structures . co-expression of atpum23-gfp and atpum24-gfp with a nucleolar targeted marker protein  confirmed that these structures were indeed nucleoli . interestingly, atpum <dig> and atpum <dig> are the only arabidopsis puf proteins with long polypeptide extensions at the carboxyl-terminal end of the pum-hd. nucleolar localization signals are not easily predictable; however, these signals are often enriched in the basic amino acids lysine and arginine, two amino acids that are well represented in the carboxyl-terminal regions of atpum <dig> and atpum <dig>  these two proteins have predicted nuclear localization signals . atpum <dig> possesses a predicted nls at position  <dig> near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein, and atpum <dig> has two predicted nls sequences near the amino-terminal end .

to determine whether the various atpum proteins were segregated into distinct cytoplasmic particles, several pairs of atpum-fluorescent protein fusions  were co-expressed in epidermal cells. each pair of co-expressed atpum fusion proteins co-localized within the same cytoplasmic particles . however, there was a frequent concentration bias of either gfp or rfp fluorescence in co-localizing particles, indicating that atpum proteins were not necessarily represented in equimolar concentrations within each particle.

discussion
the arabidopsis and rice puf gene families are extensive, consisting of a greater number of members than any other model species studied to date  <cit> . considering the size of the arabidopsis and rice genomes , puf genes are over-represented in the plant genome when compared to other species. whole genome duplications may have contributed to the large number of plant puf genes. the ancestral arabidopsis genome was duplicated three times in the past 150- <dig> million years  <cit> , and the rice genome, along with that of other monocots, has probably experienced at least one duplication event  <cit> . in addition to whole-genome duplications, puf gene expansion likely increased as a result of single gene duplications in both arabidopsis and rice, as demonstrated by the presence of tandem gene copies . the presence of plant, algal and yeast sequences in the two main branches of the phylogenetic tree  indicates that the pum-hd of these proteins has remained relatively conserved in these species. branches containing arabidopsis sequences only  suggests that independent radiation of puf proteins has occurred in this species, in a similar fashion to a large group of puf proteins in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . the maintenance of duplicated plant puf genes may be related to the sessile lifestyle of plants and their ability to adapt to challenging environmental conditions. if plant puf proteins function in mrna decay and translational repression as they do in other organisms, they could function to regulate the stability or translation of their target mrnas in response to environmental stimuli in a rapid and coordinated manner. indeed, microarray profiling revealed extensive changes in atpum transcript expression patterns in response to various external stimuli .

homology modeling of atpum <dig>  atpum <dig> and os01g <dig> pum-hds predicted that these domains adopt the characteristic crescent shaped structure that is common to pum-hds . the identity of the amino acids at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in each of the atpum <dig> and os01g <dig> puf repeats are identical to those in the drosophila pumilio and human pum <dig> proteins, and provide conserved interactions with their corresponding rna bases in the nre <dig> sequence . the predicted interaction between the atpum <dig> pum-hd and the nre <dig> was confirmed by emsa assays . the ugu core target sequence appears necessary for binding the atpum <dig> pum-hd, as demonstrated by the reduced affinity of atpum <dig> to an nre that contained a point mutation in this core sequence . this result is consistent with a recent study that utilized a three-hybrid assay to determine binding interactions  <cit> . the predictable association between amino acids within each puf repeat and their bound nucleotide was revealed previously for human pum <dig>  where substitution of specific amino acid side chains demonstrated that an rna recognition code exists for this protein  <cit> . however, puf proteins appear able to interact with rna binding sites that vary substantially in sequence outside of their ugu core. for instance, human pum <dig> binds hundreds of mrna targets in vivo  <cit> , as do puf proteins from drosophila, c. elegans and yeast  <cit> . these subsets of mrnas are typically related in function or in their subcellular localization pattern  <cit> . in addition to binding to rna targets with sequence variability, the pum-hd of several puf proteins can accommodate binding targets that are greater than eight nucleotides in length by flipping out spacer nucleotides  <cit> . evidence is emerging that individual plant puf proteins also bind to a range of mrna targets  <cit> .

many of the plant puf proteins have considerable variability in the amino acids at position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in their pum-hd that are predicted to be involved in molecular interactions with rna bases . several of these variable triplet amino acids are found in puf proteins identified in other organisms  <cit> , however, many are unique to plants. should these variable puf proteins indeed possess rna binding activity, the amino acid sequence variability could provide another level of specificity for puf mrna targets in plant cells. the triplet amino acids in the puf repeats of atpum <dig> differ from those in atpum <dig> in six of the eight puf repeats , and modeling of atpum <dig> indicated that the nre <dig> is not an ideal target for this protein, based on the predicted absence of stacking interactions . the observation that several of the arabidopsis and rice proteins have fewer than  <dig> recognizable puf repeats might also provide a mechanism for variable rna target specificity. yeast puf proteins that possess only six puf repeats function as rna-binding proteins that function in post-transcriptional control of gene expression  <cit> . whether the plant puf proteins that possess only two, three or four repeats are bona fide rna-binding proteins or function in some other cellular capacity, remains to be determined. it is possible that one or more of these proteins are encoded by pseudogenes and are not functional. however, transcriptional array data indicates that these genes are actively transcribed in arabidopsis , providing support for their expression and activity.

additional regions that were identified within puf proteins could play a role in determining rna target specificity. a histidine side chain in puf repeat 8' from human pum <dig> is involved in stacking interactions with the uracil base bound to puf repeat  <dig>  <cit> . repeat 8' is present in most plant pum-hds , and the modeled atpum <dig> structure indicates that this conserved histidine does indeed provide a stacking interaction with the corresponding rna base . the nabp domain located in the amino terminal region of several arabidopsis and rice puf proteins, and the additional puf repeats in the atpum <dig> amino terminal region , could also enhance specificity of rna targets by binding to regions of the transcript that lie outside of the pum-hd binding site. the recruitment of other factors might also enhance the rna binding specificity of the pum-hd. the convex surface of repeats  <dig>   <dig> and 8' in the drosophila pum-hd interacts with its co-factors nanos and brat, and this interaction involves an extended loop that lies between repeats  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . a conserved extended loop in the atpum <dig> pum-hd indicates that a similar interaction might also occur , although homologs of nanos and brat have not been identified in plants. interestingly, the model of the atpum <dig> pum-hd structure reveals potential loops between puf repeats  <dig> and  <dig>  and repeats  <dig> and  <dig> . these loops also present potential binding surfaces for regulatory proteins.

most of the atpuf proteins that were expressed in epidermal cells as fluorescent protein fusions were localized to dynamic, punctate structures in the cytoplasm . the prevalence of predicted nes sequences in these proteins, and the observed nuclear accumulation of many of these after treatment with lmb indicates that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is a common feature of these proteins. the enrichment of atpum <dig> and atpum <dig> fluorescent protein fusions within nucleoli provides another association of puf proteins with the nucleus . nucleoli are traditionally known to be involved in the transcription and processing of ribosomal rna and ribosome subunit biogenesis, and in the assembly of rnps  <cit> . more recently, the discovery that numerous mrnas, the exon-junction complex of proteins, rna-binding proteins, and other proteins localize to nucleoli in plant cells supports a role for the nucleolus in mrna processing, silencing, surveillance and export  <cit> . additionally, a search of the human nucleolar database http://www.lamondlab.com/nopdb <dig> / identified a human pumilio-domain containing protein. as well, yeast puf6p, an ash <dig> mrna-binding protein, is a nuclear shuttling protein that is enriched in the nucleolus  <cit> , as is mammalian staufen, another protein involved in cytoplasmic mrna localization  <cit> . thus, the nuclear associations of atpum proteins suggest that these proteins are components of a preassembly complex that is involved in rna decay, translational control or cytoplasmic transport of specific groups of mrnas.

CONCLUSIONS
the puf family of rna-binding proteins in arabidopsis and rice contain a greater number of members than in any other model species studied thus far. the modeled three-dimensional structure of three plant pum-hds is conserved, however, the identity of the amino acids that are predicted to contact rna bases demonstrates considerable variability throughout this family of proteins. emsa and subcellular localization studies indicate that these proteins are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that bind to rna in a sequence specific manner. the large number of plant puf protein family members suggests that these proteins are key in regulating the stability and translation of a significant number of mrnas in the cell. important future studies include the identification of target mrnas for individual plant puf proteins, determination of co-crystal structures of divergent puf proteins with their cognate rnas, and identification of the components of puf protein-containing particles.
