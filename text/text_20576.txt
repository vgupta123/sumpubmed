BACKGROUND
type iii secretion systems  use a conserved apparatus  to provide an energy-driven conduit from a bacterium to the cell membrane and cytoplasm of targeted eukaryotic cells <cit> . a hallmark of ttsss is the presence of two secreted translocators that assume a position at the tip of the ttsa needle to form a pore in the host cell membrane <cit> . once the mature tip complex has formed, the conduit is completed and vectorial transfer of a pathogen-specific repertoire of secreted effector proteins can occur <cit> . ultimately, it is these effectors that allow for subversion of normal host cellular functions to the benefit of the bacterium.

within each ttss a conserved, class ii chaperone protein is required to prevent premature association of translocator proteins while maintaining them in a secretion competent state, ready to be presented in a temporal fashion to the ttsa <cit> . in the enteric pathogen shigella flexneri, invasion plasmid gene  c is the class ii chaperone for invasion plasmid antigens  b and c. owing to this central role in supporting translocator function, ipgc is essential for shigella virulence as an ipgc null strain is noninvasive <cit> . furthermore, upon release of the ipab and ipac effectors, ipgc binds to the arac-like transcription factor, mxie to promote expression of late-effector genes <cit> . in this manner, ipgc appears to provide a critical link between ttss induction and those events which occur immediately following bacterial contact with the host cell.

two reports describing high-resolution crystal structures of two class ii chaperones have provided a great deal of insight into the structure and function of these all alpha-helical, tetratricopeptide repeat  proteins. first, the crystal structure of an amino-terminally truncated form of sycd  from yersinia enterocolitica, was reported <cit> . in this work, büttner et al. proposed that the biologically-relevant unit of the sycd chaperone is a dimer comprised of a "head-to-head" arrangement of equivalent monomers <cit> . this observation was supported by analytical gel filtration chromatography studies on targeted mutants in two residues, a <dig> and l <dig>  whose disruption ablated the homomeric contacts that stabilize the dimerization interface. moreover, a sycd null strain complemented with the dimerization disrupting double mutant  was unable to secrete either yop translocator protein and exhibited characteristics typical of a sycd null mutant <cit> . separately, lunelli et al. recently described the crystal structure of a carboxy-terminally truncated form of s. flexneri ipgc  <cit> . though they share only 26% sequence identity, the ipgc polypeptide displays a great deal of structural homology with sycd. however, the biological unit of this class ii chaperone appeared to arise from an asymmetric dimer involving the first three alpha helices of each unique monomer. in particular, helix  <dig>  and the loop connecting h <dig> to h <dig> adopted distinct arrangements in both subunits of the dimer. deletion of the amino-terminal  <dig> amino acids of ipgc, which includes the entirety of h <dig>  destroyed the dimerization ability of ipgc <cit> , and subsequent complementation studies demonstrated that this deleted chaperone was unable to complement an ipgc null strain of shigella in hela cell invasion assays <cit> .

the apparent importance of asymmetric dimerization in the face of previous results that argued similarly in favor of the "head-to-head" motif suggests that both modes of dimerization may be functionally relevant. for this to be the case, however, evidence must be provided to suggest that a single class ii chaperone can adopt both the asymmetric and "head-to-head" dimer arrangements. here we present the crystal structure of an amino-terminally truncated variant  of the shigella class ii secretion chaperone ipgc. like its full-length counterpart, we find that ipgc10- <dig> is a dimer in solution. however, the dimerization interface of ipgc10- <dig> observed in our crystal structure is characterized by a rotationally symmetric "head-to-head" arrangement of identical polypeptides chains. surprisingly, this mode of quaternary structure is far more similar to that reported for sycd rather than for the longer form of ipgc . the potential implications for these observations to class ii chaperone activity and ttsss function are discussed.

RESULTS
crystallization and structure determination of an amino-terminally truncated form of ipgc
limited subtilisin treatment of recombinant, full-length ipgc was used to generate protease stable fragments of the shigella chaperone that were characterized by lc-ms/ms <cit> . two predominant products were identified that corresponded to loss of nine  and twenty  residues, respectively, from the amino terminus of ipgc . recombinant forms of both proteins were overexpressed, purified, and crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion. x-ray diffraction data were collected from both crystal systems as described in table  <dig>  while both crystals diffracted x-rays to moderate resolution, the ipgc21- <dig> crystals displayed very large cell parameters and were not pursued further. initial attempts to solve the ipgc10- <dig> crystal by molecular replacement all failed when either  the complete ipgc1-151dimer,  residues 10- <dig> from either monomer of the ipgc1- <dig> structure, or  residues 20- <dig> from either monomer of the ipgc1- <dig> structure were used as a search model. in contrast, iterative rounds of likelihood-based molecular replacement using a search model of residues 30- <dig> of a single ipgc1- <dig> polypeptide chain eventually provided sufficient information to identify all  <dig> copies of the ipgc10- <dig> protein present. given the complexity of the asymmetric unit, and the resolution limits of the diffraction data available, a complete set of  <dig> strict non-crystallographic symmetry operators was used in all steps of model building and refinement. this resulted in the completed structure  with rwork and rfree values of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

armerge = ΣhΣi|ii-<i>|/ΣhΣiii, where ii is the ith measurement of reflection h and <i> is a weighted mean of all measurements of h.

br = Σh|fobs-fcalc|/Σh|fobs|. rcryst and rfree were calculated from the working and test reflection sets, respectively. the test set constituted 5% of the total reflections not used in refinement.

evidence for alternative quaternary structures in ipgc
as was expected from the absolute level of sequence identity between the ipgc10- <dig> structure presented here and either ipgc1- <dig> monomer described by lunelli et al. <cit> , the ipgc polypeptide monomers superimpose well with one another . the only noteworthy difference between these structures lies in the amino terminal regions  of these two forms of ipgc. whereas these residues in ipgc1- <dig> form two short, ordered alpha helices <cit> , the same region of ipgc10- <dig> adopts an extended coil-like structure. this significant structural difference provides the most likely explanation for why molecular replacement searches with either ipgc1- <dig> dimers or models with insufficiently truncated amino termini failed. separately, quantitative comparisons of structure superposition <cit>  between ipgc10- <dig> and sycd21- <dig> reveal that the corresponding monomer structures are nearly as similar to one another as are the two forms of ipgc . while this is somewhat surprising given the limited sequence identity  between these proteins, it further underscores the high level of tertiary structure conservation among ttss class ii chaperones.

sycd21-163
adenotes the number of residues from structure  <dig> that superimpose within  <dig>  Å distance of an equivalent position in structure  <dig> 

beven though the actual sequence identity between these two samples is 100%, the cα location of a <dig> in chain of a of the ipgc1- <dig> structure actually lies closer to that of i <dig> of ipgc10- <dig> when these two structures are superimposed.

cthe lga_s parameter represents a scoring function to evaluate the overall levels of structural similarity between two sets of coordinates. for each set of corresponding residues, it combines information pertaining to both the faction of residues that overlap within a given rmsd window as well as those that overlap within a given distance cutoff <cit> .

examination of the refined structure indicates that the ipgc10- <dig> crystals consist of an ordered lattice of protein dimers. however, much like the structures of sycd21- <dig> <cit> , ipgc1- <dig> <cit> , and pcrh21- <dig> <cit> , more than one plausible dimerization arrangement are observed. the first class of dimer is present in nine crystallographically unique copies and is characterized by a "head-to-head" orientation, where each monomer is related by a single axis of rotational symmetry . this "head-to-head" dimer buries an average of  <dig>  Å <dig> of surface area upon formation, which compares favorably to the  <dig>  Å <dig> interface previously described for ipgc1- <dig> <cit> . a distinct class of rotationally-symmetric arrangement occurs only once within the asymmetric unit, though it can be generated for all other ipgc10- <dig> chains by application of crystallographic operators . it is worth noting, however, that this "tail-to-tail" dimer buries only an average of  <dig>  Å <dig> upon formation, or approximately 60% of the surface masked by the "head-to-head" structure. furthermore, the contacts present in the "head-to-head" dimer are more extensive and conserved to a far greater extent  than are those found in the "tail-to-tail" structure . when considered together, these data strongly suggest that the "head-to-head" dimer is the relevant structure for ipgc10- <dig>  and that the other dimerization mode most likely arises from crystallization.

the identification of a rotationally symmetric dimer within the ipgc10- <dig> crystal raised questions about its relationship to the dimers previously described for ttss class ii chaperones . in this regard, the "head-to-head" arrangement of ipgc10- <dig> superimposes relatively poorly with the asymmetric dimer of ipgc1-151; overall, only  <dig> of  <dig> corresponding cα positions lie within  <dig>  Å distance and an rmsd of  <dig>  Å. by contrast, the ipgc10-155dimer overlays surprisingly well with the dimer previously described for sycd21-163; here,  <dig> of  <dig> corresponding cα positions lie within  <dig>  Å distance with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å. it is important to note that the lower rmsd for the first superposition arises because cα positions that lie outside of the  <dig>  Å distance cutoff are omitted from rmsd calculation. thus, even though the two ipgc structures share a substantially higher level of identity in terms of sequence and overall monomer structure , the far greater number of aligned residues between the ipgc10- <dig> and sycd21- <dig> dimers indicates that their "head-to-head" quaternary structures are closely related.

although the biological unit of the ipgc1- <dig> structure has been defined as an asymmetric dimer of structurally unique subunits, examination of ipgc1- <dig> chains related by crystallographic symmetry reveals two separate contacts reminiscent of the ipgc10- <dig> quaternary structure . the first of these contacts is found in the ipab peptide-bound form of ipgc1- <dig>  and buries  <dig>  Å <dig> of surface area upon formation . when compared carefully to the ipgc10- <dig> dimer, it is apparent that the symmetry-related ipgc1- <dig> chain in this contact is rotated to a greater extent relative to the monomer found within the asymmetric unit; as a result, only  <dig> of  <dig> cα positions superimpose within  <dig>  Å distance. separately, a "head-to-head" dimer is also observed within the lattice contacts of the unbound ipgc1- <dig> structure . this arrangement buries  <dig>  Å <dig> of surface area upon formation and, aside from the previously mentioned difference in the amino terminal region, shares a higher level of homology to the ipgc10- <dig> dimer. in this case,  <dig> of  <dig> possible cα positions superimpose within  <dig>  Å distance. most importantly, the aromatic residues which line this interface are identical to those found in the ipgc10- <dig> dimer , as described below.

residues that comprise the 'head-to-head' dimerization interface in ipgc are conserved across ttss class ii chaperones
while the ipgc10- <dig> dimer buries approximately  <dig> Å <dig> of surface area upon formation, closer inspection reveals that this interaction is comprised largely of two separate regions from each respective monomer. the first of these gives rise to the sycd-like interface , and involves an intricate array of almost exclusively hydrophobic interactions between the α <dig> and α <dig> helices of opposing ipgc10- <dig> chains. chief among these is a network of homophilic contacts between phe residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  whose sidechains nearly intercalate with one another . hydrophobic interactions aside, a single hydrogen bond between the sidechains of tyr <dig> and glu <dig> is also found within this interface. separately, a distinct region of contact that masks nearly  <dig> Å <dig> of surface area is likewise observed in the ipgc10- <dig> dimer. this interface arises from packing of nearly the entire extended amino terminus of one ipgc10- <dig> chain against primarily the α <dig> helix of its counterpart polypeptide . intriguingly, this region includes residues ala <dig> and val <dig>  two residues whose concerted mutation has been shown to disrupt the dimerization of ipgc1- <dig> <cit> . analytical gel filtration chromatography was used to analyze the effect of this double mutant on the oligomeric state of both ipgc1- <dig> and ipgc10- <dig> . however, both proteins migrated as a single species with an observed molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda in this assay . in contrast to previous data <cit> , these results suggest that dimerization may not be fully ablated by simultaneous mutation of both ala <dig> and val <dig> 

the nature and extent of the contacts made by the ipgc10- <dig> amino terminus makes it difficult to interpret the overall significance of sequence conservation in this region of the protein. however, examination of a structure-based multiple-sequence alignment of class ii chaperones indicates that nearly all of the positions mentioned in regard to the sycd-like interface are well conserved . this is especially true in the case of bica and sica, which are less divergent members of this family. it is somewhat surprising that the residues which participate in ipgc10- <dig> homophilic contacts are biochemically distinct from those of sycd, which instead relies on hydrophobic contacts of opposing ala <dig> and leu <dig> sidechains for dimerization <cit> . the fact that the quaternary arrangement of ipgc10- <dig> and sycd21- <dig> is so similar even though the residues lining this interface are different strongly suggests that the ability to form this "head-to-head" dimer is a conserved structural feature among ttss class ii chaperones.

the 'head-to-head' dimer of ipgc supports chaperone activity
the remarkably different mode of dimerization between ipgc10- <dig> and ipgc1- <dig> raised questions as to whether two distinct quaternary arrangements could be supported by this protein. to address this question, analytical gel filtration chromatography was used to determine whether the dimers observed in the ipgc10- <dig> structure were present in solution. comparison of the elution profile of ipgc10- <dig> to a calibration curve of globular protein standards reveals an observed molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda ; given a theoretical value of  <dig>  kda per monomer, this strongly suggests that this amino-terminally truncated ipgc behaves as a dimer in solution. this conclusion is also supported by chemical crosslinking of ipgc10- <dig>  which reveals the generation of covalent ipgc dimers following a timecourse exposure to the amine reactive agent bs <dig> . previous studies have also reported that genetic truncation of residues 1- <dig> in ipgc results in the formation of soluble but aggregated protein and that this is most likely due to the loss of both helices responsible for asymmetric dimerization of ipgc <cit> . however, two pieces of evidence suggest that this may not be entirely the case. first, while recombinant ipgc21- <dig> did not behave as a single, ideal species when analyzed by gel filtration, it nevertheless migrated according to the defined oligomeric states of tetramer  and dimer . second, ipgc21- <dig> yielded diffraction quality crystals , an outcome that seems highly unlikely with an aggregated sample. separately, both of these amino-terminally deleted forms of ipgc maintain the ability to bind ipab within the context of a copurification assay . since ipab cannot be expressed in a soluble fashion in e. coli without its cognate chaperone <cit> , this result indicates that these amino-terminally deleted proteins maintain the chaperone activity previously attributed to ipgc <cit> . together, these results strongly suggest that residues 1- <dig> are dispensable for both dimerization of ipgc and for chaperone activity, and that ipgc is capable of adopting both asymmetric and "head-to-head" dimer arrangements in solution.

CONCLUSIONS
in the last year, two separate studies have reported the crystal structures of class ii chaperones bound to peptide fragments of ttss translocator proteins. even though the structures of ipgc1-151-ipab <cit>  and pcrh21-160-yopd <cit>  are meant to mimic recognition of separate classes of full-length translocator proteins from two distinct organisms, both structures reveal that the translocator peptide lies within a groove found on the concave tpr "hand" of the chaperone. this indicates that their mechanism of translocator/ligand recognition is similar, despite the fact that the quaternary structures appear to differ considerably between ipgc1- <dig> and pcrh21- <dig>  the significant differences between the "head-to-head" dimer observed in both sycd21- <dig> <cit>  and pcrh21- <dig> <cit>  with the asymmetric structure of ipgc1- <dig> raise important questions regarding the precise nature of class ii chaperone dimers in the physiological setting. further complicating this issue are the cogent biophysical, biochemical, and/or functional data which support each of these crystal structures.

our observation that a single ttss chaperone can adopt two distinct quaternary arrangements suggests that both the asymmetric and head-to-head dimers may have important physiological roles in bacterial ttsss. as stated earlier, ipgc has the ability to bind two separate translocator proteins, ipab and ipac <cit> , as well as the arac-family transcription factor, mxie <cit> . the ability of ipgc to bind each of these proteins is regulated by the secretion state of the s. flexneri cell <cit> . secretion of both ipab and ipac through the ttsa needle liberates ipgc, and allows it to interact with mxie; this culminates in the expression of the late effectors <cit> . it is believed that an amino terminal secretion signal targets effectors to the secretion system and that chaperones may also be involved in guidance of their complexes to the base of the ttsa needle <cit> . the potential switch in quaternary structure of ipgc may therefore be involved with its ability to effectively bind or deliver translocators to the secretion system. for example, though both types of chaperone dimer are competent to bind peptide mimics of their translocator targets, a change in dimerization state might alter the stoichiometry of various chaperone/ligand complexes within the context of full-length proteins. addressing this possibility will require more thorough characterization of translocator proteins, such as ipab and ipac, for which little tertiary structural information is currently available. along these lines, ipgc could also transition between asymmetric and symmetric dimerization modes to accommodate its broad range of interaction partners. because the change in dimerization appears to correlate with a loss of amino acids at the amino terminus of ipgc, an ordered proteolytic event in this region might trigger a change in quaternary structure that affects ipgc function. whether such a transition could result in a change in the role of ipgc from secretion chaperone to transcriptional coactivator remains to be determined. in any case, additional study will be needed to explore the potential roles of both modes of dimerization in the shigella ttss as well as that from other pathogens.
