BACKGROUND
aldoximes, a group of nitrogen-containing plant secondary metabolites, have been intensively studied as key intermediates in the biosynthesis of plant defense compounds such as glucosinolates, cyanogenic glycosides, and various phytoalexins . moreover, these compounds are known to be released as volatiles from flowers and vegetative organs of a multitude of plant species  <cit> . in general, aldoximes are produced from their corresponding amino acid precursors through the action of cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  of the cyp <dig> family . members of this family have been identified from several plant species and the presence of putative cyp <dig> genes in all angiosperm genomes sequenced so far suggests a widespread distribution of cyp79s in higher plants  <cit> . the first reported cyp <dig> enzyme, cyp79a <dig>  was isolated from sorghum  and catalyzes the conversion of l-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime which is the precursor of dhurrin, the major cyanogenic glycoside in sorghum  <cit> . cyp79b <dig> and cyp79b <dig> from arabidopsis are two examples of cyp <dig> enzymes involved in glucosinolate and phytoalexin formation. both enzymes accept l-tryptophan as substrate and produce indole-3-acetaldoxime which is further converted into indole glucosinolates and camalexin in arabidopsis  <cit> . the aldoxime intermediates produced by cyp <dig> enzymes do not accumulate in the plant but are channeled within a large protein complex called a metabolon  <cit> .

recently, it has been shown that cyp <dig> enzymes are also responsible for the production of volatile aldoximes. the two enzymes cyp79d6v <dig> and cyp79d7v <dig> from populus trichocarpa catalyze the formation of -2-methylbutyraldoxime, -3-methylbutyraldoxime, and -isobutyraldoxime from l-isoleucine, l-leucine, and l-valine, respectively  <cit> . the aldoximes produced are characteristic components of the herbivore-induced volatile blend of poplar and it has been demonstrated that they are involved in the attraction of natural enemies of herbivores  <cit> . in addition to the volatile aliphatic aldoximes which are released from poplar without detectable accumulation in the plant, cyp79d6v <dig> and cyp79d7v <dig> also produce the less volatile -phenylacetaldoxime. this compound was found to accumulate in poplar leaves after herbivore feeding and bioassays using pure -phenylacetaldoxime revealed a toxic effect against a generalist lepidopteran herbivore, suggesting that aldoxime accumulation may contribute to direct plant defense against insects  <cit> .

during the last two decades, maize  has become an important model species for studying plant-insect interactions on a physiological and molecular level. as many other plants, maize responds to caterpillar feeding by the expression of a complex arsenal of defense reactions such as the accumulation of secondary compounds  <cit> , the formation of defensive proteins  <cit> , and the release of volatiles  <cit> . despite the intensive research on maize, there is little information about the occurrence of aldoximes and aldoxime-derived defense compounds in this plant species. a few early papers reported maize as a cyanogenic species. however, the measured hydrogen cyanide content was rather low in comparison to sorghum and other cyanogenic plants, and a cyanogenic glycoside could not be identified in maize so far . the emission of aliphatic aldoximes from herbivore-damaged maize has been reported for two different cultivars  <cit>  but it seems that the majority of maize germplasm is not able to generate such compounds  <cit> . however, a recent survey of all available plant genomes revealed the presence of four putative cyp <dig> genes in the maize genome  <cit> . we have now begun to study these enzymes and their contribution to aldoxime production in maize.

this paper reports the characterization of cyp79a <dig>  an enzyme able to convert l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan into phenylacetaldoxime and indole-3-acetaldoxime, respectively. simulated herbivory on maize leaves resulted in the upregulation of cyp79a <dig> gene expression and in an increase in amino acid substrate accumulation, corresponding to higher levels of phenylacetaldoxime in treated plants in comparison to undamaged control plants. since indole-3-acetic acid  was also significantly upregulated after the treatment, we propose that cyp79a <dig> plays a role in herbivore-induced auxin formation.

RESULTS
maize possesses four cyp <dig> genes
in a previous study on poplar cyp <dig> enzymes  <cit> , we performed a blast analysis with all available angiosperm genomes to study the distribution of cyp <dig> genes in higher plants. among others this analysis revealed the presence of four putative cyp <dig> sequences in the genome of the maize inbred line b <dig>  the open reading frames of the four genes grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig> encode for proteins with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids, respectively . motifs reported to be conserved in cyp <dig> proteins such as the heme binding site , the perh motif, and the np motif in one of the substrate binding sites were also found in the identified maize cyp <dig> sequences . a phylogenetic analysis using these sequences and already characterized cyp79s from other plant species showed that grmzm2g <dig> clustered together with sorghum cyp79a <dig>  while the other three maize proteins grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig> formed a separate clade in the basal part of the phylogenetic tree . a synteny analysis of the maize and sorghum genomes revealed that grmzm2g <dig> and sorghum cyp79a <dig> seem not to represent orthologous genes since they were found to be located in non-syntenic genomic regions . however, the putative sorghum cyp <dig> gene sb10g <dig> which encodes a protein with  <dig>  % amino acid sequence similarity to grmzm2g <dig> could be identified as a likely orthologue of grmzm2g <dig> .fig.  <dig> comparison of the amino acid sequences of putative maize cyp79s with sorghum cyp79a <dig>  amino acids identical in all five sequences are marked by black boxes and amino acids with similar side chains are marked by gray boxes. sequence motifs characteristic for cyp <dig> proteins are labeled

we tried to amplify the maize cyp <dig> genes from cdna made from herbivore-damaged seedlings of the commercial hybrid line delprim, a cultivar commonly used in maize-insect interaction studies. while the complete open reading frame of grmzm2g <dig> could be isolated from the cdna, the amplification of grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig> failed, suggesting that these genes were not present in delprim or not expressed in seedlings under the experimental conditions. the grmzm2g <dig> gene obtained was designated cyp79a <dig> following the standard p <dig> nomenclature .

cyp79a <dig> produces - and -isomers of phenylacetaldoxime and indole-3-acetaldoxime after yeast expression
for heterologous expression in yeast , the complete open reading frame of cyp79a <dig> was cloned into the vector pesc-leu2d  <cit>  and the resulting construct was transferred into the s. cerevisiae strain wat <dig> which carries the arabidopsis cytochrome p <dig> reductase  <dig>   <cit> . prepared microsomes containing recombinant cyp79a <dig> and cpr <dig> were incubated with the potential amino acid substrates l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, l-isoleucine, and l-leucine in the presence of the electron donor nadph. enzyme products were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  analysis and verified by the use of authentic standards prepared as described in the methods section. cyp79a <dig> accepted l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan as substrates and converted them into mixtures of the - and -isomers of phenylacetaldoxime and indole-3-acetaldoxime, respectively . no activity could be observed with l-tyrosine, l-isoleucine, and l-leucine. the ph optima for the formation of phenylacetaldoxime and indole-3-acetaldoxime were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and the substrate affinity for l-phenylalanine  was slightly higher than that for l-tryptophan  . since measurements of carbon monoxide difference spectra were inconclusive, we were not able to determine the protein concentrations in the microsomes and thus to calculate the turnover numbers for the different substrates. however, the large difference between the maximal velocities  for 1 mm l-phenylalanine -phenylacetaldoxime*h−1*assay−1) and 1 mm l-tryptophan -indole-3-acetaldoxime*h−1*assay−1)  suggests a higher turnover number for l-phenylalanine than for l-tryptophan.fig.  <dig> catalytic activity of cyp79a <dig>  yeast microsomes containing the heterologously-expressed enzyme a or an empty vector control b were prepared and incubated with the potential substrates l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan. products were detected using lc-ms/ms analysis with multiple reaction monitoring in the positive mode. diagnostic reactions for each product: phenylacetaldoxime, m/z  <dig> / <dig> ; indole-3-acetaldoxime, m/z  <dig> / <dig> . the structures of all detected cyp79a <dig> products are shown in c

nicotiana benthamiana expressing cyp79a <dig> produces phenylacetaldoxime, indole-3-acetaldoxime and phenylacetaldoxime-derived metabolites
to verify the biochemical properties of the recombinant protein in an in vivo plant system, cyp79a <dig> was transferred into nicotiana benthamiana using agrobacterium tumefaciens and transiently expressed under control of the 35s promoter. as a negative control, a vector carrying the 35s::egfp fusion was used. a construct encoding the suppressor of silencing protein p <dig>  <cit>  was coinfiltrated to increase transient protein expression. the egfp-expressing plants showed a bright fluorescence on the 3rd day after infiltration. thus, cyp79a <dig> products were analyzed 3 days after infiltration. to analyze potential volatile aldoxime products, a volatile collection was performed. plants expressing the maize cyp79a <dig> gene were found to release -phenylacetaldoxime in small amounts . in addition, some structurally related volatiles including 2-phenylacetaldehyde, 2-phenylethanol, benzyl cyanide, and 2-phenylnitroethane could be detected in the headspace of these plants . in contrast, control plants expressing egfp released none of the above-mentioned compounds. lc-ms/ms analysis of methanol extracts made from leaf material harvested right after the volatile collection revealed a strong accumulation of -phenylacetaldoxime and a moderate accumulation of -indole-3-acetaldoxime in leaves harboring the 35s::cyp79a <dig> construct, while no aldoximes could be detected in leaf material harvested from egfp-expressing control plants .fig.  <dig> aldoxime accumulation a and volatile emission b of transgenic n. benthamiana plants overexpressing maize cyp79a <dig>  plants were infiltrated with a. tumefaciens containing 35s:egfp  or 35s:cyp79a <dig>  aldoximes were extracted three days after infiltration with methanol and analyzed using lc-ms/ms. volatiles were collected on the third day after infiltration. identification of volatile compounds was done with gc-ms and quantification was done with gc-fid. pald, 2-phenylacetaldehyde; 2pe, 2-phenylethanol; bc, benzyl cyanide; pn, 2-phenylnitroethane; -paox, -phenylacetaldoxime; -paox, -phenylacetaldoxime. means and standard errors are shown 



caterpillar oral secretion induces cyp79a <dig> gene expression as well as amino acid substrate accumulation and phenylacetaldoxime formation
to test whether the expression of cyp79a <dig> is influenced by herbivory, young maize plants of the cultivar delprim were treated with oral secretion collected from egyptian cotton leafworm  larvae and cyp79a <dig> transcript accumulation was analyzed in the leaves using quantitative rt-pcr. while undamaged control plants showed a basal cyp79a <dig> expression, simulated herbivory led to a significant increase in transcript accumulation . in contrast, spi <dig>  a member of the yucca-like gene family in maize which has been reported to be involved in indole-3-acetic acid formation  <cit> , was not expressed in damaged and undamaged maize leaves . lc-ms/ms analysis of l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan in methanol extracts made from the same samples revealed a significant upregulation of both cyp79a <dig> substrates in response to the oral secretion treatment . -phenylacetaldoxime showed a similar accumulation pattern with significantly higher amounts in damaged leaves than in undamaged controls . indole-3-acetaldoxime, however, could not be detected in these leaf extracts.fig.  <dig> the response of maize leaves to simulated herbivory. cyp79a <dig> gene expression a, l-phenylalanine b and l-tryptophan c accumulation, -phenylacetaldoxime content d, and phenylacetic acid e and indole-3-acetic acid f levels were measured in undamaged leaves  and leaves subjected to simulated herbivory . -phenylacetaldoxime, l-phenylalanine, l-tryptophan, and the auxins phenylacetic acid and indole-3-acetic acid were extracted with methanol and analyzed by lc-ms/ms. gene expression was determined by qrt-pcr. means and standard errors are shown . asterisks indicate statistical significance in student’s t-test. gene expression: p <  <dig> ; t = − <dig> ; l-phenylalanine: p <  <dig> , t =  <dig> ; l-tryptophan: p <  <dig> , t =  <dig> ; phenylacetaldoxime: p = <  <dig> , t =  <dig> ; phenylacetic acid: p = <  <dig>  , t = − <dig> ; indole-3-acetic acid: p = <  <dig> , t = − <dig> 



caterpillar secretion induces the formation of the auxins indole-3-acetic acid and phenylacetic acid as potential aldoxime-derived metabolites
to investigate whether the maize cultivar delprim is able to produce volatile aldoximes after herbivory, we conducted a volatile collection on plants treated with caterpillar oral secretions. despite the accumulation of -phenylacetaldoxime in leaves, no aldoximes or aldoxime-derived nitriles or nitro compounds could be detected as volatiles . however, several mono- and sesquiterpenes, green leaf volatiles and esters could be identified which have already been described in the literature  <cit> .

we then looked for potential metabolites of indole-3-acetaldoxime and phenylacetaldoxime since both are thought to be potential precursors for the biosynthesis of the auxins indole-3-acetic acid and phenylacetic acid , respectively  <cit> , we searched for these metabolites in leaves of undamaged and oral secretion-treated maize plants. the accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid as well as the accumulation of phenylacetic acid was significantly increased in treated leaves in comparison to undamaged control leaves .

since aldoximes are intermediates in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glycosides, we also searched for these compounds in maize leaves. maize has been reported as a cyanogenic plant species , but no cyanogenic glycosides have been identified so far. we used lc-ms/ms analysis to measure potential phenylacetaldoxime-derived cyanogenic glycosides, such as prunasin and amygdalin, as well as the p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime-derived cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin in oral secretion-treated maize leaves and in coleoptiles of maize and sorghum. as already reported in the literature  <cit> , dhurrin was found in large amounts in sorghum coleoptiles. however, none of the above mentioned cyanogenic glycosides could be detected in maize , suggesting that at least the tested cultivar delprim is not able to accumulate these compounds in significant amounts.

discussion
aldoximes and aldoxime-derived compounds such as nitriles and cyanogenic glycosides are widespread secondary plant metabolites. they play important roles in plant defense against insects and pathogens  <cit>  and are discussed to be involved in plant-pollinator interactions  <cit> . although maize as one of the most important crop species has been intensively investigated during the last decades, little is known about the occurrence and role of aldoximes in this plant.

in this paper, we identified and characterized the p <dig> enzyme cyp79a <dig>  one member of a small gene family comprising four genes with similarity to plant cyp79s. like other cyp <dig> enzymes from the a- and b-subfamilies, recombinant cyp79a <dig> was shown to accept only aromatic amino acids as substrates. however, in contrast to most other cyp <dig> enzymes which have very high substrate specificity  <cit> , both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the recombinant maize enzyme was able to convert l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan to phenylacetaldoxime and indole-3-acetaldoxime, respectively . the conversion of a broader range of amino acids into aldoximes has only been reported for two poplar cyp79d enzymes  <cit> . the km values of cyp79a <dig> for l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan were relatively high  =  <dig>  μm; km =  <dig>  μm), but in the range reported for other cyp <dig> enzymes. it has been suggested that the low substrate affinity of these enzymes has evolved to avoid possible depletion of the free amino acid pool in plants  <cit> .

the analysis of aldoximes in maize revealed a significant increase in phenylacetaldoxime accumulation in leaves treated with caterpillar oral secretion in comparison to leaves from undamaged control plants , suggesting a role of this compound in plant defense. phenylacetaldoxime was previously shown to accumulate in poplar leaves after herbivory by gypsy moth  caterpillars and feeding of pure phenylacetaldoxime to l. dispar larvae had negative effects on caterpillar survival, growth, and time until pupation  <cit> . although the overall concentration of phenylacetaldoxime in maize leaves subjected to simulated herbivory  was relatively low compared to that found in poplar leaves, local formation of this compound giving higher concentrations around the wound site as already reported for defensive sesquiterpenes in maize  <cit>  is conceivable. in addition, aldoximes have been suggested to play a role in plant defense against pathogens  <cit>  and the accumulation of phenylacetaldoxime in treated maize leaves might thus represent a defense barrier against pathogen attack following insect herbivore damage. apart from accumulating in plant tissue, aldoximes can serve as precursors for other defensive compounds . in the japanese apricot , for example, phenylacetaldoxime is converted into the cyanogenic glycosides prunasin and amygdalin  <cit> . this is unlikely to occur in maize since we could not detect these compounds neither in regurgitant-treated leaves nor in maize coleoptiles , the developmental stage reported to possess the highest cyanogenic potential  <cit> . however, we cannot rule out that phenylacetaldoxime acts as a precursor for other so far unknown maize defense compounds.

since cyp79a <dig> had similar km values for l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan and both amino acids were found to accumulate in the same order of magnitude in maize leaves , one would expect that the enzyme produces equal amounts of phenylacetaldoxime and indole-3-acetaldoxime in planta. however, while phenylacetaldoxime was detected in maize leaves, no accumulation of indole-3-acetaldoxime could be observed . local differences in amino acid substrate concentrations caused, for example, by specific substrate channeling processes might be an explanation for this observation. however, it is far more likely that the lack of indole-3-acetaldoxime detection is due to the aldoxime being further converted into other compounds. in various plant species, including maize, the conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime into the corresponding acid is thought to serve as an alternative route for the formation of the essential plant growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid , presumably involving indole-3-acetonitrile as an intermediate  <cit> . the analysis of cyp79a <dig> transcript accumulation in maize leaves revealed that the gene was significantly upregulated after herbivore feeding, matching an increased accumulation of iaa in the same tissues . moreover, overexpression of cyp79a <dig> in n. benthamiana revealed that the enzyme is able to produce indole-3-acetaldoxime under natural conditions in planta . thus it is conceivable that cyp79a <dig> might produce indole-3-acetaldoxime as a specific substrate for herbivory-induced iaa formation in maize leaves. the conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime to indole-3-acetonitrile is likely catalyzed by a p <dig> enzyme similar to the recently described poplar enzymes cyp71b <dig> and cyp71b <dig> which were shown to produce benzyl cyanide from phenylacetaldoxime after herbivory  <cit> . indole-3-acetonitrile could then be further converted into iaa by maize nitrilase  <dig>  an enzyme already implicated in auxin formation in maize  <cit> . in future experiments, the overexpression of maize cyp79a <dig> in an arabidopsis cyp79b <dig> cyp79b <dig> double mutant which has been described to lack the accumulation of indole-3-acetaldoxime  <cit>  would allow the analysis of cyp79a61-mediated formation of indole-3-acetaldoxime and its metabolism in a clean and sensitive background in planta. since iaa can be formed via different biosynthetic pathways  <cit> , it is possible that other enzymes rather than cyp79a <dig> are responsible for the observed iaa accumulation after simulated herbivory. thus, a comprehensive expression analysis of candidate genes such as taa and yucca might help to understand the biochemical origin of herbivore-induced iaa formation in maize. however, we have already shown that spi <dig>  a member of the yucca-like gene family in maize  <cit> , was not expressed in damaged and undamaged maize leaves.

it is well established that herbivore feeding can cause changes in auxin levels in plants. for example, feeding of gall-inducing insects on wheat and late goldenrod  leads to increased iaa levels in the damaged tissues  <cit>  while simulated herbivory on wild tobacco  resulted in decreased iaa accumulation  <cit> . since auxins are potent modifiers of plant defense reactions  <cit> , it is likely that the elevated iaa and paa levels in herbivore-damaged maize also mediate defense responses. the presence of aldoxime-producing cyp <dig> genes in all so far sequenced angiosperm genomes might indicate a broader occurrence of aldoxime-mediated auxin formation, especially under biotic stresses such as herbivory or pathogen attack.

a sequence comparison with already characterized cyp79s from other plants showed that cyp79a <dig> was most similar to cyp79a <dig>  an enzyme known to catalyze the key reaction of dhurrin formation in sorghum  <cit> . however, despite an amino acid identity of 72 %, both enzymes have different substrate specificities with cyp79a <dig> solely converting tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime  <cit> . a comparative analysis of the maize and the sorghum genome revealed that cyp79a <dig> and cyp79a <dig> are not located on syntenic chromosomal regions and are therefore not orthologues . interestingly, no gene with orthology to sorghum cyp79a <dig> could be found in the maize genome , suggesting a recent loss of the cyp79a <dig> orthologue in the maize lineage after diversification of the common ancestor of maize and sorghum. this gene loss might explain the absence of dhurrin formation in maize . a so far uncharacterized sorghum cyp <dig> gene  could be identified as the orthologue of cyp79a <dig> . however, whether this gene encodes for a protein with the same substrate specificity as cyp79a <dig> remains unknown.

like dhurrin, we also could not detect the cyanogenic glycosides prunasin or amygdalin in the maize cultivar delprim, neither in coleoptiles nor in undamaged or damaged leaves of young plants . moreover, a volatile collection experiment showed that delprim did not release aldoximes after herbivory . however, in the literature there is evidence that maize is cyanogenic , and a few maize lines have been reported to produce aliphatic volatile aldoximes after herbivore feeding  <cit> . it is conceivable that the three putative cyp <dig> genes grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig>  which could not be amplified from delprim cdna, are expressed in other maize cultivars or under different experimental conditions and contribute to volatile aldoxime and/or cyanogenic glycoside formation. thus, a comprehensive characterization and gene expression analysis of different cyp <dig> alleles from diverse maize cultivars will help to further understand the formation and function of these nitrogenous defense compounds and their variability among maize cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that maize produces aldoximes in response to simulated herbivory. a p <dig> enzyme of the cyp <dig> family, cyp79a <dig>  could be identified able to catalyze the formation of phenylacetaldoxime and indole-3-acetaldoxime in two different heterologous systems. since the expression of cyp79a <dig> was upregulated after simulated herbivory, we hypothesize that the enzyme contributes to herbivore-induced aldoxime formation in maize. while phenylacetaldoxime accumulated in herbivore-damaged leaves and might play a role in maize defense against herbivores or pathogens, indole-3-acetaldoxime could not be detected in the plant. however, it is conceivable that this aldoxime is rapidly converted to indole-3-acetic acid which has been described as a mediator of various plant defense responses  <cit> .
