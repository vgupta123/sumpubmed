BACKGROUND
legionella pneumophila causes atypical pneumonia, especially in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases and underlying immunosuppression, and in elderly people. although more than  <dig> species of legionella are known, the majority of human infections are caused by l. pneumophila, particularly serogroup  <dig>  <cit> . l. pneumophila is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen of amoeba in natural and man-made aquatic environments. infection of humans occurs after inhalation of contaminated water aerosol droplets.

l. pneumophila can multiply within the mononuclear cells in vivo and in vitro and evades phagosome-lysosome fusion within these cells. it contains an array of important virulence factors including the dot/icm type iv secretion system, which is important for bacterial invasion and replication in the host cells  <cit> . several l. pneumophila virulence factors that facilitate intracellular growth have been identified by analyzing infection of protozoans or immunocytes like macrophages  <cit> . however, it has been estimated that there are  <dig>  type i pneumocytes,  <dig>  type ii pneumocytes and  <dig> alveolar macrophages per alveolus in an average human male  <cit> . thus, legionella and other pathogenic organisms, which cause respiratory infection, might well interact with the epithelial cells lining the space.

lung epithelial cells constitute the first mechanical and immunological barrier against airborne pathogens and are important sources of cytokines in the lung  <cit> . although legionella efficiently infects and stimulates lung epithelial cells  <cit> , the mechanisms of l. pneumophila-induced activation of cytokine genes in lung epithelial cells are mostly unknown. when the organisms are inhaled into the respiratory tract, the epithelial cells react to defend against the invaders and intra-alveolar exudation of neutrophils is observed. interleukin- <dig>  is a chemotactic factor and activator of neutrophils, basophils and t cells  <cit>  and is involved in the early host response to pathogens  <cit> . in fact, serum il- <dig> concentration is a potential marker of legionella pneumonia  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed the signaling pathways for il- <dig> activation in human lung epithelial cells by legionella infection, using human a <dig> alveolar and nci-h <dig> tracheal epithelial cell lines.

RESULTS
multiplication of l. pneumophila in human lung epithelial cell lines
we first examined intracellular growth of l. pneumophila strain aa100jm in a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells by 72-h continuous cultures. the colony forming unit  per well of aa100jm growing in a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cell cultures began to increase after  <dig> h and then increased time-dependently . however, the cfu of the avirulent mutant strain with a knockout in doto, encoding a protein essential for the type iv secretion system, did not increase during the 72-h period . furthermore, the multiplication of flaa mutant was slightly inhibited in a <dig> cells compared with the wild-type corby . this observation suggests that flagellin plays a role in uptake into non-phagocytic cells.

infection of a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells by l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> expression
monolayers of a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells were infected with l. pneumophila strain aa100jm for up to  <dig> h. total cellular rna was isolated from these cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after the infection and il- <dig> gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . il- <dig> mrna expression increased immediately after the infection and its signal became gradually stronger in a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells until  <dig> h after infection . in another series of experiments, in which a <dig> cells were infected with aa100jm at different concentrations for  <dig> h , aa100jm induced dose-dependent expression of il- <dig> mrna. next, we examined the correlation between il- <dig> expression level and the virulence of l. pneumophila. as shown in figure  <dig>  il- <dig> mrna expression was induced immediately after the infection and reached a peak level at  <dig> h, but became gradually weaker from  <dig> to  <dig> h after infection with the avirulent doto mutant. moreover, legionella flagellin seemed to be involved in il- <dig> expression, since a flaa knockout mutant, defective in flagellin production, failed to induce il- <dig> mrna immediately after the infection . however, its signal was induced by the flaa mutant at  <dig> h post-infection.

to determine the correlation between il- <dig> expression levels and bacterial proteins of l. pneumophila, heat-killed aa100jm was used to infect a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  il- <dig> mrna expression levels at  <dig> and  <dig> h in both cell lines infected with the heat-killed strain were significantly lower than those of cell lines infected with the live strain . furthermore, paraformaldehyde-fixed l. pneumophila showed no induction of epithelial il- <dig> gene expression .

il- <dig> production from a <dig> cells during infection with l. pneumophila
we used enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay  to determine il- <dig> protein levels in culture supernatants of a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells at  <dig> h after infection with either the parental strain aa100jm or doto mutant strain and either the parental strain corby or flaa mutant strain at an moi of  <dig>  l. pneumophila did not alter the cell viability within an moi of  <dig> and time frame tested . we found il- <dig> induction by aa100jm and corby. on the other hand, the production levels of il- <dig> by a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells infected with the doto and flaa mutant strains were significantly less than those of cells infected with the wild-type strains .

l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> gene transcription via a sequence spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> of the il- <dig> gene promoter
to delineate the mechanism by which l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> gene transcription, we identified l. pneumophila-responsive promoter elements in the il- <dig> promoter. this was achieved by transfecting a <dig> cells with various plasmid constructs containing the luciferase reporter gene driven by the il- <dig> promoter . twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were infected with l. pneumophila strain aa100jm. the 5' region  <dig>  bp full-length promoter was reproducibly activated by l. pneumophila infection in an moi-dependent manner . these results indicate that l. pneumophila induces il- <dig> expression in a <dig> cells at transcriptional level. next, we used a deletion analysis approach to identify essential promoter elements for transcriptional upregulation following a stimulus. high induction levels were observed with a reporter construct containing il- <dig> 5'-flanking sequence starting with position - <dig>  to position - <dig>  deletion of sequences upstream of position - <dig> abolished inducibility by l. pneumophila infection . the il- <dig> gene fragment spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> bp contains three prominent dna-protein interaction sites for the transcription factors ap- <dig>  nf-il- <dig> and nuclear factor-κb  . this maps the region from - <dig> to - <dig> bp as a l. pneumophila-responsive region, which is likely to contain individual l. pneumophila-responsive regulatory elements.

previous studies have shown that the ap- <dig> and nf-il- <dig> sites act cooperatively with nf-κb to induce il- <dig> gene transcription  <cit> . to identify the cis-acting elements in the - <dig> to - <dig> bp region of the il- <dig> promoter, which served as a l. pneumophila-responsive regulatory element, we prepared and tested site-directed mutant constructs . the results shown in figure 6b indicate that mutation in the nf-κb site  resulted in a significant reduction of l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> production. mutation of the ap- <dig> site  decreased basal activity but had little effect on l. pneumophila-induced luciferase activity . however, mutation of the nf-il- <dig> site  did not result in reduction of either basal activity or activity induced by l. pneumophila infection. these results indicate that activation of the il- <dig> promoter in a <dig> cells in response to l. pneumophila infection requires an intact binding site for the nf-κb element.

the nf-κb site of il- <dig> gene can mediate l. pneumophila-induced gene activation
to further determine the exact site that is sufficient for l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> production, we used various constructs . each construct contained three tandemly repeated copies of one of the following elements: the nf-κb or nf-il- <dig> site from the il- <dig> gene or two copies of the ap- <dig> binding site from the il- <dig> gene. each was linked to the minimal il- <dig> promoter spanning - <dig> to + <dig> bp and to the luciferase reporter gene. the construct ×  <dig> nf-κb site-luc, which contains three tandem repeats of the nf-κb site from the il- <dig> gene, generated a  <dig> -fold stimulation by l. pneumophila infection. in contrast, constructs ×  <dig> ap- <dig> site-luc and ×  <dig> nf-il- <dig> site-luc did not exhibit l. pneumophila-induced gene expression in a <dig> cells . these results indicate that the nf-κb site of the il- <dig> gene is important for activation of l. pneumophila-induced gene expression. in contrast, the ap- <dig> and nf-il- <dig> sites, essential for il- <dig> induction by various stimuli in other cell types, are not involved in this form of l. pneumophila-responsiveness.

l. pneumophila infection induces a single predominant nf-κb binding complex, while ap- <dig> is constitutively expressed in a <dig> and nci-h <dig> cells
to investigate the trans-acting factors involved in the activation of il- <dig> by l. pneumophila infection, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay  with a probe spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> bp of the il- <dig> promoter, which includes the nf-κb binding site at - <dig> to - <dig> bp . l. pneumophila infection induced a single predominant nf-κb binding complex. this binding was specifically competed by an excess of unlabeled nf-κb from the il- <dig> gene  but not by an oligonucleotide containing ap- <dig> from the il- <dig> gene . to further characterize the nf-κb complex, we performed supershift experiments using specific antisera. an antibody against nf-κb p <dig>  p <dig> or c-rel specifically shifted and diminished the formation of the complex , while an antibody against p <dig> or relb had no effect . these data suggest that this dna-protein complex represents a p50–p <dig> or p50-c-rel heterodimer product. in contrast, ap- <dig> binding was constitutively present in nuclei from uninfected cultures, appearing as a single band on emsa . this dna-protein complex contained fra- <dig> and jund . nuclear extracts from l. pneumophila-infected a <dig> cells incubated with the ap- <dig> probe showed no increase in binding compared with uninfected extracts . taken together, the results of cold competition and supershift assays indicate that l. pneumophila-induced proteins bind the nf-κb site but not the ap- <dig> site, which is in agreement with the functional data shown in figure  <dig> 

phosphorylation and degradation of iκbα by l. pneumophila infection
in resting cells, nf-κb proteins are predominantly sequestered in the cytoplasm by nf-κb inhibitory proteins iκbα and iκbβ. the activation of nf-κb requires phosphorylation of two conserved serine residues of iκbα  and iκbβ  within their n-terminal domain  <cit> . phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination and 26s proteasome-mediated degradation of iκbs, thereby releasing nf-κb from the complex followed by its translocation to the nucleus to activate various genes  <cit> . to investigate whether nf-κb activation is mediated through alteration of phosphorylation of iκbα, a <dig> cells were infected with l. pneumophila and their protein extracts were checked for phosphorylated iκbα expression. l. pneumophila infection induced the phosphorylated iκbα. kinetic analysis of l. pneumophila-induced degradation of iκbα in a <dig> cells revealed gradual replacement of iκbα levels , suggesting that induction of phosphorylation of iκbα by l. pneumophila infection leads to degradation of iκbα protein.

nf-κb signal is essential for induction of il- <dig> expression by l. pneumophila
since activation of the il- <dig> promoter by l. pneumophila infection required activation of nf-κb, we blocked nf-κb activation with bay 11- <dig>  an inhibitor of iκbα phosphorylation  <cit> , or n-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinaldehyde , a proteasome inhibitor  <cit> . these studies served to demonstrate a link between nf-κb activation and upregulation of il- <dig> expression in l. pneumophila-infected a <dig> cells. as shown in figure 8a, bay 11- <dig> or llnl markedly inhibited l. pneumophila-induced expression of il- <dig> mrna. we next examined whether l. pneumophila-mediated activation of il- <dig> gene expression involves signal transduction components in nf-κb activation. a high-molecular-weight complex, iκb kinase  complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits  and a regulatory subunit , phosphorylates iκbs  <cit> . members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase protein kinase family mediate physiological activation of ikk  <cit> . these kinases include nf-κb-inducing kinase   <cit> . we tested the ability of dominant interfering mutants of iκbα, iκbβ and ikkγ, and kinase-deficient mutants of ikkα, ikkβ and nik to inhibit l. pneumophila-mediated activation of the il-8-driven reporter gene. expression of these various inhibitory mutants abolished the induction of il- <dig> promoter by l. pneumophila infection . these data show that signaling components involved in the activation of nf-κb are necessary for l. pneumophila activation of il- <dig> promoter.

inhibition of hsp <dig> reduces il- <dig> expression induced by l. pneumophila
the  <dig> kda heat shock protein, hsp <dig> is a major molecular chaperone of the cell, and appears to have particular significance to cellular regulatory processes. recent studies have revealed that most of client proteins of hsp <dig> are protein kinases or transcription factors that play important roles in cellular carcinogenesis  <cit> . currently, several groups documented that hsp <dig> plays a critical role in inflammatory response and its inhibitor resulted in a reduced immune response as indicated by a decrease of proinflammatory mediator production  <cit> . furthermore, a recent study indicated that ikkα and ikkβ are clients of hsp <dig>  <cit> . hsp <dig> has been found to associate stoichiometrically with the ikk complex by binding to the ikkα and ikkβ kinase domains  <cit> . as a possible mechanistic link between l. pneumophila infection and inflammation, we hypothesized the involvement of hsp <dig>  to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of l. pneumophila infection on hsp <dig> and evaluated the effect of hsp <dig> inhibitor, 17-aag, on l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression. a <dig> cells constitutively expressed hsp <dig> protein , but l. pneumophila did not affect its expression . next, we analyzed whether hsp <dig> inhibitor could prevent l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression. for this purpose, a <dig> cells were pretreated with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin  prior to l. pneumophila infection. the significant induction of il- <dig> mrna expression was completely inhibited by pretreatment of 17-aag . the finding suggests possible involvement of hsp <dig> in l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> signaling.

because 17-aag seemed to suppress l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression and nf-κb was identified as a critical regulator responsible for il- <dig> transcription, we tested the direct influence of 17-aag on l. pneumophila-induced transcriptional activity of nf-κb as a major transcriptional factor of il- <dig> using by emsa. pretreatment with 17-aag decreased the retardation of gel mobility through the inhibition of dna binding activity of nf-κb complex, indicating repression of transcriptional activity of nf-κb . since a recent study indicated that ikkα and ikkβ are clients of hsp <dig>  <cit> , we examined the effect of 17-aag on expression of ikkα and ikkβ. treatment of a <dig> cells with 17-aag reduced the amounts of ikkα and ikkβ proteins but not those of ikkγ and hsp <dig> . these results suggest that 17-aag-mediated hsp <dig> inhibition depletes ikkα and ikkβ, resulting in inactivation of nf-κb.

several hsp <dig> client proteins are degraded by the proteasome following hsp <dig> inhibition. to examine whether proteasomal degradation was responsible for decreased levels of client proteins after 17-aag treatment, a <dig> cells were cultured in a medium containing 17-aag and the proteasomal inhibitor llnl. 17-aag-mediated degradation of ikkα and ikkβ proteins was blocked by llnl . in contrast, ikkγ and hsp <dig> were not destabilized by 17-aag, and llnl did not change the levels of ikkγ and hsp <dig>  the reversal of 17-aag-induced degradation of the ikkα and ikkβ proteins by llnl suggests that these proteins are subjects to ubiquitin-dependent turnover.

discussion
there is abundant information on legionella, particularly l. pneumophila, infection and macrophages/monocytes. however, details about the interaction of legionella with lung epithelial cells remain scarce. il- <dig> is an inflammatory chemokine associated with immune-mediated pathology where it is involved in recruitment and activation of neutrophils and other immune cells  <cit> . the present study focused on il- <dig> expression on human lung epithelial cells in l. pneumophila infection and discussed the possible transmission-signaling pathway of il- <dig> induction.

our results showed that l. pneumophila infection caused the expression and release of il- <dig> from lung epithelial cells, which are the primary site of pulmonary infection  <cit> . the expression and production of il- <dig> showed dose- and time-dependent patterns. however, the expression of il- <dig> mrna in a <dig> cells infected with the avirulent doto mutant was transient and became weaker from  <dig> h post-infection than that in the cells infected with the wild-type strain. a previous study reported that infection of peritoneal macrophages of a/j mouse with legionella resulted in production and release of il- <dig>  il-1α, il-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, in culture supernatants; however, peritoneal macrophages never produced any cytokines when infected with an avirulent l. pneumophila strain  <cit> . these results were different from those of the present in which epithelial cells produced low levels of il- <dig> when infected with the avirulent strain. this difference may be due to differences features of the two types of cells. furthermore, we found that flagellin-deficient legionella failed to induce il- <dig> mrna immediately after the infection, but its signal was induced at  <dig> h post-infection. thus, in l. pneumophila infected epithelial cells, il- <dig> upregulation seems to be controlled by two mechanisms: the first depends on substrate translocation via type iv secretion system and/or intracellular replication between  <dig> and  <dig> h while the other is bacterial growth-independent response induced immediately after the infection.

il- <dig> gene transcription requires activation of the combination of nf-κb and either ap- <dig> or nf-il- <dig>  depending on the cell type  <cit> . these observations prompted us to investigate the contribution of these transcription factors to l. pneumophila-driven il- <dig> gene transcription. in contrast to previous reports, we now report that l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression is independent of intact ap- <dig> and nf-il- <dig> sites. these results suggest that different sets of nuclear transcription factors may be responsible for the regulation of il- <dig> gene transcription in cell type- and stimulus-specific manners. interestingly, ap- <dig> was the preferred transcription factor  for cooperative interaction with nf-κb for il- <dig> gene expression in respiratory syncytial virus-infected a <dig> cells  <cit> . however, our results demonstrated that activation of nf-κb, but not that of ap- <dig> or nf-il- <dig>  was indispensable for l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> gene transcription, suggesting that the molecular mechanism involved in il- <dig> gene transcription differed, even within the same cell, depending on the employed stimulus.

the mammalian signaling pathways in epithelial cells that are triggered by l. pneumophila remain largely unknown. in the present study, we identified the cellular kinases nik and ikks as participants in nf-κb-dependent il- <dig> induction by l. pneumophila in lung epithelial cells. recently, it has been reported that l. pneumophila triggers nuclear localization of nf-κb in human and mouse macrophages in a dot/icm-dependent manner  <cit> . thus, these studies and our results suggest that l. pneumophila activates il- <dig> gene through dot/icm-dependent nf-κb activation. as concerns the expression and production of ccl <dig> that attracts immature dendritic cells and memory t cells, the similar results were obtained in l. pneumophila-infected a <dig> cells . since these data implicate a crucial involvement of nf-κb in l. pneumophila-provoked inflammation, nf-κb inhibitor may be a potentially useful therapeutic agent for legionnaire's disease in addition to antibiotics.

a pathway exists for nf-κb activation via the cytosolic sensor nod, which recognizes intracellularly localized peptidoglycan products  <cit> . there is evidence that peptidoglycan products are delivered across the plasma membrane by the helicobacter pylori type iv secretion system, promoting nod1-dependent nf-κb activation, so it is possible that dot/icm uses a similar strategy to activate nf-κb  <cit> . furthermore, nik participates in several nod2-dependent cellular responses to peptidoglycan-derived structures  <cit> . because nod <dig> and nod <dig> were expressed in a <dig> cells , we are under investigation if activation of nf-κb by the dot/icm system is dependent on nod <dig> and nod <dig> 

the doto mutant could still induce il- <dig> mrna expression immediately after infection. several host intracellular molecules are known to directly recognize bacteria and/or bacterial products, and trigger the appropriate inflammatory signaling pathway. nf-κb can be activated by engagement of toll-like receptors  at the host cell surface in response to microbial molecules that are present on both pathogens and non-pathogens  <cit> . tlr <dig> is activated by flagellin protein, and in humans a common polymorphism in the tlr <dig> gene causes a deficiency in mediating signals from flagellin and increased susceptibility to legionnaire's disease  <cit> . flagellin-deficient legionella failed to induce il- <dig> mrna expression immediately after infection. a <dig> cells used in the present study were observed to express tlr- <dig> by rt-pcr . induction of il- <dig> may initially occur through other signaling pathways via tlr- <dig> engaged by surface-exposed l. pneumophila flagellum. after the completion of this work, schmeck et al. reported that l. pneumophila induced nf-κb-dependent il- <dig> release by lung epithelial cells  <cit> . however, they demonstrated that l. pneumophila srains induced flagellin-dependent but dot/icm-independent il- <dig> release. although n'guessan et al. reported that ikk might contribute to l. pneumophila-induced-nf-κb signaling pathway, it is likely to be independent of dot/icm  <cit> . why our results differ from them is unclear at this time. because they did not remove bacteria after cells were inoculated with l. pneumophila, dota-knock out mutant might induce il- <dig> expression and nf-κb activation via flagellin of extracellular bacteria.

in addition, we documented, for the first time, the effect of hsp <dig> inhibitor, 17-aag, on l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> expression and identified its molecular mechanism. 17-aag inhibited il- <dig> mrna expression in l. pneumophila-infected lung epithelial cells. the finding may be due to inactivation of nf-κb signaling induced by l. pneumophila infection. hsp <dig> is a regulator of nf-κb signaling through its general involvement in ikk activation  <cit> . 17-aag decreased ikk complex proteins, ikkα and ikkβ. the loss of ikk reduced nf-κb dna-binding, resulting in reduced l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> mrna expression.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide important insights on the importance of hsp <dig> and nf-κb pathway in l. pneumophila-induced il- <dig> production. it seems that recognition of extracellular pathogenic factors of legionella such as flagella initially contributes to il- <dig> induction and type iv secretion system dot/icm is essential for sustained il- <dig> expression in epithelial cells infected with l. pneumophila.
