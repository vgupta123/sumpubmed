BACKGROUND
enterobacter sakazakii was defined as a new species in  <dig> by farmer et al  <cit> . dna-dna hybridization gave no clear generic assignment for e. sakazakii as it was shown to be 53–54% related to species in two different genera, enterobacter and citrobacter. however the species was placed in enterobacter as it appeared phenotypically and genotypically closer to e. cloacae than to c. freundii, the type species of these genera. in the original study fifteen biogroups of e. sakazakii were described. recently the existence of a sixteenth biogroup has been reported and a correlation between 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, which separated e. sakazakii strains into several genetic groups, and biogroups has been demonstrated  <cit> . the existence of these divergent groups seems to support the suggestion of farmer et al that e. sakazakii may harbour different species  <cit> . however previous studies were based on only partial  16s rrna gene sequence analysis, whereas for taxonomical purposes the complete gene should be sequenced   <cit> . it has until recently been generally accepted that it is unlikely that two bacterial strains belong to the same species if the similarity between their 16s rrna genes is <97%  <cit> , but based on an extensive evaluation of published data this value has been amended to a range between  <dig> –99%.  <cit> . for strains whose 16s rrna gene similarity exceeds this threshold value, a dna-dna reassociation assay must be performed and only if this test reveals more than 70% relatedness can it be concluded that the strains belong to the same species  <cit> .

dna profiling methods such as ribotyping  <cit>  and amplified fragment length polymorphisms  have been shown to discriminate at the species and subspecies level and may provide valuable additional information in taxonomic studies. the aflp technique has been employed in plant and microbiological research to describe the molecular ecology of various niches and this technique can be used to determine inter- and intra-species relatedness  <cit> . mougel et al  <cit>  found that members of the same genomic species cluster consistently using aflp analysis and suggested that future genomic delineation of bacterial species could be based on this approach.

in this study, independent molecular methods, including f-aflp, automated ribotyping, full-length 16s rrna gene sequencing and dna-dna hybridization, were employed to clarify the taxonomic relationship of  <dig> strains currently described as e. sakazakii and amendments to the classification of these organisms are proposed.

RESULTS
the  <dig> e. sakazakii strains were assigned to biogroups as originally described by farmer et al  <cit>  with the addition of biogroup  <dig> as described by iversen et al  <cit> . the defining characteristics used to identify each biogroup  are as previously described  <cit> . full length 16s rrna gene sequences, comprising greater than  <dig> bp with less than  <dig> % undetermined positions, were obtained for  <dig> e. sakazakii strains representative of the different biogroups and  <dig> strains representative of other species. additional sequences were downloaded from the embl database. in agreement with previous partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, the majority of the full-length e. sakazakii 16s rrna gene sequences clustered closely with the type strain, e. sakazakii atcc 29544t . the remaining sequences formed three clusters . representative strains  were compared using f-aflp . calculation of point-bisectional correlations to statistically delimit relevant clusters resulted in two groups equating to 16s rrna groups  <dig> &  <dig> and 16s rrna groups  <dig> &  <dig>  at a cut off level of 50% similarity six clusters could be delineated, which corresponded to strains belonging to 16s rrna groups  <dig> to  <dig> plus a subset of group  <dig> comprising strains of biogroups  <dig> &  <dig>  and a subset of group  <dig> . ribotyping was performed for  <dig> strains including representatives of all different biogroups . all the e. sakazakii strains shared more than 62% pattern similarity whereas other enterobacteriaceae shared less than 62% pattern similarity with the e. sakazakii strains. a similarity of greater than 70% was used to delineate separate e. sakazakii groups resulting in four clusters 1-r, 2-r, 3-r, and 4-r, which correspond to 16s rrna groups 1– <dig> 

dna-dna hybridizations were performed with two strains from each of the four groups . the e. sakazakii type strain, atcc 29544t, and atcc  <dig>  showed 70% dna relatedness suggesting that they belong to the same species considering that a dna homology of 70% is generally regarded as the limit for species delineation  <cit> . although the value appears low, the similarity between the 16s rrna gene sequences for these two strains was  <dig> % and they clustered closely using the f-aflp analysis and ribotyping, which supports their same species relationship. previously, dna-dna hybridization of  <dig> strains of e. sakazakii resulted in relative binding ratios between 72–95% at an optimal renaturation temperature of  <dig> °c  <cit> . group  <dig> comprises biogroups 1– <dig>  7– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as described by farmer et al  <cit> . isolates belonging to biogroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> grouped together as a subcluster of group  <dig> in the ribotype analysis  and representative strains of this subgroup also formed a coherent cluster in the f-aflp analysis . no other relationship between biogroup and subcluster was identified for the other strains within group  <dig>  the 16s rrna gene sequences of biogroup  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains displayed  <dig> % similarity with atcc 29544t. these strains share the common feature of being positive for malonate utilization and are proposed as a subspecies of group  <dig> 

§% relatedness values are averages of duplicate measurements and standard deviations are given in parentheses .

two strains from different branches within group  <dig>  atcc 51329t and cdc 3523- <dig>  showed 92% dna relatedness whereas their relatedness to the group  <dig> strains was only 31–53% . also the similarity of the 16s rrna gene between group  <dig> strains was  <dig> % but only  <dig> % similarity was shared with atcc 29544t . this is below the threshold of  <dig> % recently proposed at which dna-dna hybridization is mandatory  <cit> . further, these strains shared greater than 50% pattern similarity using f-aflp analysis but less than 50% similarity to all other strains . from these results it can be concluded that the group  <dig> strains represent a single distinct species from atcc 29544t. group  <dig> comprises strains identified as biogroup  <dig>  <cit> .

group  <dig> is comprised of strains identified as biogroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> along with nctc  <dig>  dna-dna hybridization of cdc 5960- <dig>  and nctc  <dig>  showed 77% dna relatedness, whereas the dna relatedness to the group  <dig> strains was 16–55% . also the 16s rrna gene similarity within group  <dig> was  <dig> % compared with a similarity to atcc 29544t of  <dig> % . using f-aflp analysis group  <dig> strains shared more than 50% pattern similarity supporting the conclusion that these all belong to the same novel species . this leads to the conclusion that the group  <dig> strains represent a single distinct species from atcc 29544t.

group  <dig> equates to strains recently identified as biogroup  <dig>  two strains from different branches within this group,  <dig>  and nctc  <dig>  showed approximately 55% dna homology, which is clearly below 70%, suggesting the two branches within group  <dig> represent different species. the dna relatedness of lmg 23827t to group  <dig> was approximately 52% and the 16s rrna gene similarity was  <dig> %. the dna relatedness of nctc  <dig> to group  <dig> was approximately 55% with  <dig> % 16s rrna gene similarity . the 16s rrna gene sequences for all strains in group  <dig> were more than 99% similar to each other, but were only  <dig> – <dig> % similar to the 16s rrna gene sequence of e. sakazakii atcc 29544t . the ribotype analysis clustered eight of the group  <dig> strains together with a pattern similarity of greater than 70% . these strains also shared more than 50% pattern similarity in the f-aflp analysis . however two strains, nctc  <dig> and e <dig>  did not cluster with the other biogroup  <dig> strains using ribotyping. also, although they consistently clustered in close proximity, both strains shared less than 50% pattern similarity to the other biogroup  <dig> strains based on f-aflp analysis . this indicates there are two species within group  <dig> and both of these are distinct species from atcc 29544t.

dna homology values amongst strains belonging to different groups were all clearly below 70%, therefore it was concluded that the e. sakazakii strains in this study represent five separate species . statistical analysis of phenotypic profiles  showed that important biochemical tests for species differentiation were indole production, malonate utilization and acid production from dulcitol and methyl-α-d-glucoside . phenotypic profiles allowed the differentiation of four dna hybridization groups and within group  <dig> two phenotypic subgroups could be delineated. nctc  <dig> and e <dig> could not be distinguished from the other biogroup  <dig> strains using the tests within this study.

it is important, however, that reclassification of species is not detrimental to health protection measures already in place and that all risk organisms continue to be recognized. the different species currently identified as e. sakazakii contain clinical isolates cultured from body sites that would normally be sterile. as there is insufficient evidence regarding the virulence potential of these species to conclude that any one of them does not represent a health risk to neonates, it is proposed that enterobacter sakazakii be reclassified as four species, one genomospecies, and two subspecies in a new genus within the family enterobacteriaceae. these organisms are a microbiological hazard occurring in the infant food chain with historic high morbidity and mortality in neonates  <cit> . therefore cronobacter gen. nov. is proposed after the greek mythological god, cronos, who was described as swallowing his children at birth  <cit> . this genus would contain the type species, c. sakazakii comb. nov.  with c. sakazakii subsp. sakazakii comb. nov. and c. sakazakii subsp. malonaticus subsp. nov.; c. muytjensii sp. nov. ; c. dublinensis sp. nov. ; c. turicensis sp. nov. ; and, as nctc  <dig> and e <dig> cannot be phenotypically distinguished from c. turicensis subsp. nov. and there are only two of these strains, it is proposed that they are referred to as cronobacter genomospecies  <dig> for the present. the phenotypic differentiation of cronobacter spp. from other common enterobacteriaceae genera is presented in table  <dig>

isolates associated with neonatal meningitis were identified as belonging to c. sakazakii subsp. sakazakii subsp. nov., c. sakazakii subsp. malonaticus subsp. nov. and c. turicensis sp. nov. however, c. muytjensii sp. nov. and c. dublinensis sp. nov. contained human isolates from normally sterile sites, bone marrow  and blood  respectively  <cit> . the creation of a new genus simplifies the inclusion of these potentially pathogenic organisms in legislation and current identification schemes developed for e. sakazakii remain applicable for the cronobacter genus.
