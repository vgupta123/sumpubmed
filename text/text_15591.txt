BACKGROUND
the fusarium head blight disease of cereals is caused by members of the fusarium species complex, including f. graminearum, f. culmorum, f. avenaceum and f. poae <cit> . these fusarium spp. are well known for their ability to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites, some of which act as mycotoxins since they possess the ability to affect animals and humans adversely. deoxynivalenol  and zearalenone  are among the most predominant mycotoxins commonly found in infected seeds and grains  <cit> . don belongs to the type b group of trichothecenes and is produced ubiquitously during plant infection where it can act as a virulence factor  <cit> . don is a potent protein synthesis inhibitor which binds eukaryotic ribosomes and hampers protein translation  <cit> . don repressed the activity of the cell wall degrading enzyme n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase in the biocontrol fungus trichoderma atroviride, proposing an additional role of don in fusarium competitiveness besides being a disease virulence factor  <cit> . zea is a non-steroidal mycoestrogenic toxin that is produced largely by f. graminearum, f. culmorum and f. equiseti <cit> . the molecular structure of zea resembles that of the mammalian hormone 17β-estradiol, thus consumption of the toxin by mammals stimulates hypoestrogenic responses and can result in infertility and has also been linked to cancer  <cit> . limited information about the biological roles of zea is available, although it has been speculated that zea has functions in binding and activation of the k+ channel β subunit, involved in a signal transduction pathway  <cit> . zea has been shown to possess antifungal properties propounding the hypothesis that zea is synthesized to increase competitiveness with other fungi inhabiting the same niche  <cit> .

microbial detoxification of don and zea has been observed by various organisms and distinct mechanisms are involved. for example, aspergillus spp. disarmed the toxic effects of zea by conversion of the toxin to zearalenone-sulphate  <cit> . the yeast trichosporon mycotoxinivorans was proposed to transform zea by cleaving a lactone ring backbone in the similar way to the detoxifying mechanism described from clonostachys rosea that relies on action of the enzyme zearalenone hydrolase   <cit> . a recent finding reported an ability to degrade zea in the bacterium rhodococcus pyridinivorans, although the detoxification mechanism of the strain is not yet known  <cit> . on the other hand, peroxidase was speculated to degrade don in a. oryzae and rhizopus oryzae <cit>  whereas hydrolytic breakdown of don was found in a. tubingensis <cit> . several bacteria have also been found to be capable of detoxifying don. these included a bacillus sp., lactobacillus pentosus, l. paracasei and l. plantarum <cit> . thus, de-epoxidation, epimerization and mineralization are reviewed as three important don detoxifying mechanisms in microorganisms  <cit> .

clonostachys rosea  is an ascomycete fungus with a wide range of lifestyles. the fungus has been reported to live as a saprophyte, as a nematophagous fungus and as a mycoparasitic fungus  <cit> . the c. rosea strain ik <dig> is a mycoparasitic fungus that is effective in controlling plant pathogens, including alternaria spp. – the causative agent of black rot of carrot, bipolaris sorokiana – the causative agent of spot blotch of barley and don- and zea-producing f. culmorum <cit> . despite showing tolerance to don, the underlying mechanism in the fungus remains obscure. in this study, we aimed to understand mechanisms regulating resistance to don and to investigate whether additional mechanisms are involved in resistance to zea besides the well-known zhd <dig> in c. rosea. we generated cdna libraries enriched in genes expressed during interaction with don and zea. induction of genes by don and zea were subsequently confirmed by the use of quantitative reverse transcription real-time pcr . analysis of our functional annotation data suggests that metabolic readjustment is a major component for don tolerance and atp- binding cassette  transporters are involved in providing tolerance to zea, in addition to zhd <dig> 

RESULTS
construction of don- and zea-induced cdna libraries
of  <dig> sequenced clones from the don- and zea-induced libraries,  <dig> and  <dig> high-quality ests were obtained after sequence cleansing, respectively. blastx of the don-induced  <dig> ests yielded  <dig> unigene est sets representing  <dig> genes with similarity to characterized proteins ,  <dig> ests with hypothetical proteins and  <dig> transcripts with either no similarity to known sequences . the  <dig> high quality ests from the zea library represented  <dig> unigene est sets, blast searches returned  <dig> ests with similarity to characterized proteins,  <dig> ests matched hypothetical proteins and  <dig> ests showed no similarity.

up to 92% of the ests with similarity to characterized proteins from the don-induced library were assigned a go functional annotation. the major clusters were metabolic process and cellular process which represented 33% and 31% of the total ests, respectively. similarly, analysis of  <dig> zea-induced ests with similarity to characterized proteins showed that metabolic process was the largest cluster accounting for 39% of the total ests followed by cellular process and localization at 33% and 21%, respectively. distribution of ests from each library based on putative functional annotation is shown in figure  <dig>  the ests from don- and zea-induced libraries were deposited at dna data bank of japan  under accession nos. fy998777-fy <dig> and fy998945-fy <dig>  respectively. the ests that were present in high redundancy  are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> for don- and zea-induced libraries, respectively. complete putative annotation and best blast hit are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

highly redundant c. rosea genes in the don-induced library
a set of transcripts induced by don were classified with putative functions in metabolism, cell cycle, transport and stress response. the majority of the redundant transcripts putatively encoded metabolic or biosynthetic enzymes, for instance,  <dig> of cytochrome p <dig> 55a <dig> ,  <dig> of cytochrome c oxidase subunit vib ,  <dig> of diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase ,  <dig> of acyl-coa desaturase , and  <dig> of glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> .

other redundant transcripts putatively encoded proteins involved in the cell cycle. thij/pfpi protein family was among the most highly induced ests in the don-induced library, being found  <dig> times. in addition, ests encoding high affinity glucose transporter snf <dig>  hexose transporter-like protein and plasma membrane atpase  exhibited increased in expression. we also observed high redundancy for ests encoding proteins associated with stress responses. these included molecular chaperones heat shock protein hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  mitochondria hypoxia responsive domain protein and flavohemoglobin.

highly redundant c. rosea genes in the zea-induced library
analysis of the zea-induced library revealed that the majority of transcripts with high redundancy encoded zhd <dig> and abc transporters resembling candida drug resistance  <dig> and cdr <dig> of candida albicans and abc- <dig> type transporters. in addition to zhd <dig>  ests putatively encoding other metabolic enzymes were recorded including cyp <dig> and amidophosphoribosyltransferase . ests putatively encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis and tca such as pyruvate kinase , aconitrate hydratase  and pyruvate decarboxylase  were also present in high numbers in the zea-library.

in addition, we found ests encoding glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  that exhibits broad known activities, including glucan β- <dig> -glucosidase , β-mannosidase  and chitosanase , and other ests encoding proteins regulating the cell cycle, e.g., facilitating chromatin transcription  complex subunit pob <dig>  gtp binding protein  ychf and prohibitin presented in high redundancy in the zea-induced library. we also noted transcripts encoding major facilitator superfamily  transporter induced by zea.

phylogenetic analysis of abc transporters detected in the zea-induced library
local blast searches to the draft c. rosea ik <dig> genome sequence revealed that all ests from the zea-induced library exhibited similarity to only two different abc-transporter genes. the bioinformatic tool fgenesh + was further employed to predict two full-length abc transporters with  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. full-length nucleotide sequences of the two predicted genes were shown in additional file  <dig>  we performed phylogenetic analysis to investigate whether the identified abc transporters pertain to xenobiotic-transport classes of abc proteins. the analysis revealed that they belong to group g of fungal abc transporters   <cit>  and the two genes were named abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> according to the nomenclature for fungal abc transporters  <cit> . group g consists of  <dig> different subgroups in which most of them harbour relevant functions to either xenobiotic or drug transport. our analysis indicated that the abcg <dig> belong to subgroup i which is related to multidrug resistance, whereas abcg <dig> belong to subgroup v which contains members of unknown function.

gene expression of selected genes from the don- and zea-induced libraries
to validate genes induced by don and zea, we performed qrt-pcr on  <dig> selected genes from each library at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after inoculation. this temporal gene expression set-up would allow us to monitor the expression dynamics of the candidate genes. in this study, we chose expression of the candidate genes at  <dig> hours as the calibration point as we foresaw an immediate response of the fungus to zea. analysis with qrt-pcr showed that all the selected genes exhibited a rapid response to both don and zea . after 2-hour exposure to zea, the expression of transcripts encoding zhd <dig> and abcg <dig>  identified in the zea-induced library, accumulated sharply to more than a thousand fold . another abc transporter encoded by abcg <dig> was induced 186-fold . on the other hand, the selected transcripts from the don-induced library were induced to a lesser extent. up to 3- and 2-fold change in expression were detected for pycruvate decarboxylase  and diacylglycerol o-acyltransferease after 2-hour exposure to don, respectively. temporal gene expression revealed a substantial drop in expression of most selected genes from zea-induced library after  <dig> hours of exposure whereas  <dig> of  <dig> selected genes from don-induced library were increased in expression at  <dig> hours . the don-induced genes with significant alteration in expression  at  <dig> hours included cyp <dig> , diacylglycerol o-acyltransferease  and pyruvate decarboxylase .

discussion
tolerance to xenobiotics is of importance for antagonistic fungi during interactions with plant pathogens that produce a broad range of secondary metabolites. our aim with the current study is to advance our understanding of mechanisms conferring resistance to fusarium mycotoxins don and zea in the hyperparasitic fungus c. rosea ik <dig> that is effective in controlling fusarium species. for this, we employed a genome-wide transcriptomic approach based on suppression subtractive hybridization to explore molecular responses of the fungus towards don and to zea. the analysis of the don-induced transcripts does not suggest additional mechanisms compared to those previously discovered to render tolerance to don in microorganisms  <cit> . this suggests to us that resistance to don in c. rosea is complex and is the result of synergistic action of proteins from different pathways rather than a stand-alone mechanism. the analysis of zea-induced transcripts suggest that thatzhd <dig>  previously reported as a key enzyme regulating resistance to zea in c. rosea, and  <dig> abc transporters may be involved in zea resistance.

metabolic readjustment may be a major component in don tolerance in c. rosea, as transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes such as cyp <dig> 55a <dig>  cox and mitochondrial atp synthase are identified in high frequency. involvement of these enzymes in abiotic stress tolerance has been reported previously. for example, overexpression of cox improved resistance to the antimicrobial peptide miamp <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . a membrane associated atp synthase is highly induced in a cercosporin-resistant cercospora nicotianae strain but not in a susceptible strain  <cit> .

exposure to don induced expression of transcripts encoding a number of transporters. these included the high affinity glucose transporter snf <dig>  the hexose transporter-like protein trhxt <dig> and a plasma membrane h+-atpase. in s. cerevisiae, snf <dig> is a glucose sensor that generates a intracellular glucose signalling cascade required for induction of hexose transporter expression, whereas hxt <dig>  is a high-affinity glucose and mannose transporter  <cit> . the presence of ests encoding proteins similar to snf <dig> and trhxt <dig> suggests that the demand of cellular energy is increased during don exposure. taken together with up-regulation of genes encoding metabolic enzymes as mentioned above, it is possible that the increased need of cellular energy is to produce proteins to compensate those destroyed by don. this idea is supported by the up-regulation of a gene that putatively encodes a proton transporter h+-atpase, which is shown to facilitate the uptake of nutrients by providing proton gradients for membrane transporters, and to regulate intracellular ph  <cit> . interestingly, we also observed the accumulation of transcripts putatively encoding enzymes in the triglyceride synthesis pathway. triglycerides may act as an energy reservoir and the specific induction of by don, but not by zea, provide further support for an increased energy demand during don exposure.

don has been shown to generate a substantial level of reactive oxygen species  and oxidative stress, which can induce protein damage and dna strand breakage in human hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . this might explain the up-regulation of genes encoding stress-response proteins such as the chaperones   <dig> and hsp <dig> subunit that possess several important cytoprotective functions, including prevention of protein aggregation and degradation of unstable proteins  <cit> , and the cell cycle checkpoint protein  that is essential for cellular function in response to dna damage  <cit> . hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> transcripts often accumulate following exposure to biotic and abiotic stresses in several organisms  <cit> . as don generates oxidative stress that damages proteins and dna, it is likely that chk1is triggered to protect c. rosea from dna damage by the toxin, while the hsp70/ <dig> subunits act to protect or recycle damaged proteins.

a previous study showed that alterations in cell wall structure are connected with increased resistance to a killer toxin in s. cerevisiae <cit> . don-exposure induce genes that putatively encode a gh <dig> and a gh <dig> enzyme, with known α- <dig> -mannanase  and dolichol-p-mannose α-mannosyltransferase  activity, respectively. these activities are reported to be involved in incorporation of glycoproteins into the cell wall of n. crassa and s. cerevisiae <cit> . zea-exposure on the other hand induces a putative endoglucanase  gh <dig> gene that is involved in cell wall modification in a. nidulans <cit> . we may therefore hypothesise that cell wall modifications are part of the resistance machinery to both don and zea toxins in c. rosea.

zea tolerance in c. rosea was determined by zhd <dig> that cleaves off one of the lactone rings in the backbone, resulting in the product 1--10′-hydroxy-1-undecen-6′-one, and that the structural change resulted in reduced toxicity of zea  <cit> . in our study, qrt-pcr analysis showed that the fungus responded to zea as early as  <dig> hai and expression of zhd <dig> decreased significantly at least  <dig> fold when measured at later time points. this confirms that the time point chosen for library construction was accurate and also supports the previous finding of zhd <dig> as a player in zea tolerance. surprisingly, we noticed an increase in expression of transcripts encoding the molecular chaperone hsp <dig> in the zea-induced library. the fact that the fungus was stressed during exposure to zea, despite possessing zhd <dig>  suggests that zhd <dig> is not the only mechanism underlying resistance to zea in c. rosea.

abc transporters are major secondary transport systems that render resistance to xenobiotics in organisms  <cit> . we hypothesise from the abundant ests encoding abc transporters in the zea-induced library that abc transporters – together with zhd <dig> – contribute to resistance to zea in c. rosea through the significant increase in transcript levels for abc transporters from group g  of fungal abc transporters, which are well known for contributing to drug/fungicide resistance in many fungi  <cit> . this is supported by the concomitant expression of the two abc-g proteins have with zhd <dig>  this is the first report to suggest that the abc transporters are potentially involved in providing resistance to zea. previously, kakeya and colleagues demonstrated that the product of zhd <dig> activity on zea, namely 1--10′-hydroxy-1-undecen-6′-one, did not possess any estrogenic potencies to human breast cancer mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . nonetheless, it is unclear whether this degradation product 1--6′-hydroxy-1-undecen-10′-one possesses toxic activities and thus it triggers expression of the abc transporters or whether the abc proteins act as zea efflux pump preventing cells from being damaged from zea when zhd <dig> is degrading the toxin.

group g of fungal abc transporters comprises  <dig> subfamilies  <cit> , and our phylogenetic analysis of the predicted full-length c. rosea abc transporters suggested that the transporters belong to the subgroup i  and subgroup v  of subfamily g. the subgroup i is well known for contributing resistance to drugs and fungicides in fungi, and includes pdr5p and pdr10p from s. cerevisiae and cdr1p, cdr2p, cdr3p and cdr4p proteins from c. albicans. while functions of the subgroup i of abc-g proteins has been investigated thoroughly, information about the subgroup v of fungal abc-g is limited, including their biological roles. the similar expression patterns of the two abc transporters with that of zhd <dig> suggests that these c. rosea abc transporters evolved as a specific mechanism to withstand zea, potentially by providing efflux of zea and/or its digested products.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our ssh results suggested that tolerance to don in c. rosea is provided by a consort of enzymes and proteins, covering a broad range of genes from metabolism to transporters. cellular energy is manipulated to generate proteins to compensate for those that are destroyed by don. this is ascertained by the increase in transcripts encoding  metabolic-related enzymes such as cyp <dig> and cox,  sugar transports such as hxt <dig> and h+-atpase and  cellular response such as hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  on the other hand, two abc transporters may participate in conferring resistance to zea together with zhd <dig>  this is the first time that participation of abc transporters in zea detoxification are implicated, which was thought previously to rely only on zhd <dig>
