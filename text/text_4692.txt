BACKGROUND
it is anticipated that the demand for cereals will increase by 70 % by  <dig> given the increased food production needed to sustain a growing population, with the largest increases required in many low-income countries  <cit> . this pressure for more food is complicated by the negative effects of global climate change on the efficient use of water, energy and land for major crops  <cit> . extreme temperatures and water deficits are among the most serious climatic factors limiting crop production. on average, our planet’s surface temperature has registered an increase of  <dig>  °c over the past century and a further increase of  <dig> to  <dig> degrees has been predicted by the end of the present century  <cit> . although this may be beneficial for a few crops in certain high latitude regions, overall productivity will be negatively affected because of higher temperatures during the growing season and more severe and longer droughts  <cit> . thus, under this future scenario, there is a need to expand breeding programs and biotechnology strategies to improve growth performance of major crops by introducing varieties with higher yield and less vulnerability to diseases and other environmental stresses.

high temperatures adversely affect germination and water relations, shorten developmental stages and cause perturbation of photosynthesis-related processes such as light perception, carbon fixation and respiration, leading to heat-induced yield loss in cereals  <cit> . even with sufficient moisture, higher temperatures both at day and night have an effect on yield potential. for maize for instance, temperatures above 35 °c  will affect vegetative and reproductive growth, from germination to grain filling  <cit> . at the cellular level, the major consequences of high temperatures are:  alteration of membrane fluidity affecting membrane function which has an impact on photosynthesis and respiration and  onset of oxidative damage caused by the heat-induced imbalance of photosynthesis and respiration, production of reactive oxygen species  and reduced antioxidant activity  <cit> . similar to reacting to drought and salinity, plants deploy various protection mechanisms to endure heat stress  including scavenging of ros, production of antioxidants, accumulation of compatible solutes and activating signaling cascades leading to the synthesis of molecular chaperones such as heat-shock proteins  and late embryogenesis abundant  proteins. these chaperones would prevent denaturation of existing proteins, misfolding of newly synthesized proteins and maintaining membrane stability  <cit> . all these response mechanisms have been considered in strategies for improving heat tolerance through modern breeding protocols and biotechnological approaches, though up to now their success has been limited.

studies on heat response and heat tolerance have largely focused on heat shock proteins  and transcriptional activation of their genes by heat shock transcription factors   <cit> . positive correlations between expression of hsps and hs tolerance have been reported . nonetheless, besides hsps, other pathways can be potentially manipulated to improve thermotolerance. it has been suggested that part of the response to hs is mediated by the action of plant growth regulators such as cytokinin  <cit> , methyl jasmonate  <cit> , salicylate  <cit>  and brassinolides  <cit> . similarly, other molecules such as proline, glycine-betaine, polyamines or signal molecules  can aid in maintaining cell membrane integrity, ion homeostasis and increased photosynthesis, either when applied exogenously  <cit>  or by manipulating their biosynthesis . although differences exist between responses to hs and drought when imposed individually  <cit> , the above examples indicate that reactions to hs often involve interconnected networks and defense mechanisms shared with other stress responses. this is further evidenced by the protective role of hsfs and hsps against more than one abiotic stress condition .

tolerance to heat is generally characterized by transcriptional activity leading to synthesis of protective components as mentioned above. a transcriptome analysis performed in wheat, revealed the induction of a large number of transcription factors following heat treatment, including members of the hsf, ap <dig>  bhlh, bzip, myb, nac and wrky and zn-finger gene families  <cit> . interestingly, members of the same gene families were recently identified in a transcriptome study in rice  <cit> . data of the latter study showed  <dig> and  <dig> out of the  <dig> differentially expressed myb genes to be up-regulated one and eight hours after heat stress, respectively, suggesting a central role of these genes in the transcriptional response to hs. plant myb transcription factors, most of the r2r <dig> type, regulate numerous processes during the plant life cycle including responses to environmental stresses  <cit> . despite the large number of myb genes in plant species, only few have been proposed to have a role in heat tolerance. in arabidopsis, mutants for the myb <dig> gene show reduced growth under high temperature compared to wt  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that constitutive expression of the tomato lean <dig> gene encoding a myb transcription factor causes anthocyanin accumulation and confers enhanced tolerance to hs by maintaining a functional photosynthetic apparatus and a higher non-enzymatic antioxidant activity  <cit> . in a previous study, our group described that over-expression of osmyb <dig> in rice stimulated amino acid metabolic pathways crucial for normal plant growth and development, resulting in improved plant tolerance to hs during vegetative growth and decreasing the negative effect of high temperature on grain yield  <cit> .

in this work, we analyzed the effect of over-expressing osmyb <dig> in maize, an important crop with different photosynthetic mechanism than rice  but adapted to a similar climate. we performed a wide transcriptome analysis to investigate the genes and pathways affected by hs and osmyb <dig> over-expression. in addition, because a combination of hs and drought better resembles a predicted scenario of climate change, we assessed the individual and additive effects of these stress conditions on the growth of wt and transgenic plants.

RESULTS
phenotypic responses to heat stress
maize plants over-expressing the full-length cdna of the osmyb <dig> gene and representing ten single-copy transgenic lines were generated. four transgenic lines were randomly chosen to carry out the experiments described in this study and the expression levels of the transgene were determined . seedlings from wt and two osmyb <dig> transgenic lines were used to make an initial assessment of their growth in response to high temperature. plants entering the three leaf-stage were moved from  <dig> to 42 °c  and response to hs was evaluated by determining total dry biomass, plant height, stem diameter and chlorophyll content. growth reduction of transgenic plants was less affected than wt after five days of heat treatment, reflected by a small reduction of dry biomass, plant height, and stem diameter . in addition, smaller decrease in chlorophyll content in osmyb <dig> lines indicated reduced initial leaf damage to the leaves compared to wt .fig.  <dig> tolerance to high temperature of maize seedlings over-expressing osmyb <dig>

transcriptome analysis of transgenic maize under heat
because of the significant growth differences observed in response to high temperature, a similar experiment was devised to compare the transcriptomes of one transgenic line  and wt plants. transcript profiling  was performed using mrna from leaves, stems and roots of plants grown under normal and high temperature conditions. over 80 % of the filtered reads aligning to the reference genome . of  <dig>  genes,  <dig>  genes remained after filtering. comparisons were made within leaf, stem and root samples of each genotype between control and hs conditions and between genotypes. these datasets are listed in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the number of differentially expressed genes  is summarized in additional file  <dig>  with these criteria, in all three tissues, more than half of the deg between control and hs were common for wt and the osmyb <dig> line. in leaves,  <dig> and  <dig> were significantly differentially expressed only in wt and only in the transgenic line, respectively, and  <dig>  were common deg for both genotypes . lower number of up- and down-regulated entities was found for stems  and roots . comparisons between the genotypes showed reduced number of deg for plants under control or hs .

gene ontology  functional enrichment analysis was performed with the gene lists for each tissue from the comparisons between conditions  and between genotypes . go terms for biological processes are shown in fig.  <dig> and are plotted as a heat map to easily visualize common functionality across experimental conditions. in leaf samples, six go terms were enriched in the control condition when comparing osmyb <dig> line with wt, whereas only one go term  was enriched in the heat treatment comparison. when analyzing the genes up-regulated in leaves in response to heat,  <dig> go terms were enriched in wt whereas  <dig> go terms were enriched in the transgenic line. of those,  <dig> were common in both genotypes . most of these terms were also enriched in the same comparisons for the stem and root samples, in either genotype or both . other enriched terms in stem samples were associated with carbon fixation, lipid metabolic process, dna replication and lipid transport in both genotypes, plus those related to lignin catabolic process and to nucleosome assembly in the transgenic line. go terms specifically enriched in roots included carbohydrate metabolic process, trehalose biosynthetic process, nicotianamine biosynthetic process, ion transport, phosphate transport, transmembrane transport, sexual reproduction, with the last four only enriched in the transgenic line .fig.  <dig> enrichment of biological process go terms for deg. enriched terms by tissue and category . blue indicates statistically significance, fdr <  <dig> 



to have a general idea of the pathways affected by differences in gene expression, we used goseq and the same methodology for go term enrichment to identify enriched pathways. in leaves, two pathways related to synthesis of gibberellins were enriched in both conditions, and pathways associated with biosynthesis of conjugated cytokinin and branched amino acids were also enriched under hs. in addition, heat treatment caused enrichment of sulfate assimilatory pathways and phosphate acquisition in the transgenic line . in stems, a triaglycerol degradation pathway was enriched in the transgenic line. in roots, the transgenic line presented significant representation of pathways associated to photosynthesis, carbon reduction and gluconeogenesis in either treatment condition and five enriched biosynthetic pathways for flavonoids and anthocyanidins when the osmyb <dig> line was compared to wt in the hs condition .

several heat-induced genes in wt plants are constitutively up-regulated in osmyb <dig> transgenic maize
the response to heat treatment by the two genotypes was further analyzed by focusing in the transcriptome obtained from leaf samples. evaluation of the deg lists for treatment and genotype comparisons revealed that most of the significantly up-regulated genes in the transgenic line under control conditions are also highly up-regulated in wt plants in response to hs, though only about half of them presented significant p-value . in addition, six of those genes were significantly up-regulated in the transgenic line by hs. annotation for most of these entities obtained from the maizegdb shows that several of them are associated to stress responses or regulation of transcription . comparison of deg in the osmyb <dig> line with those in wt under control conditions showed that  <dig> entities displayed significant differential expression in at least two of the organs sampled .

a group of genes from tables in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> were selected to validate their expression in two independent osmyb <dig> lines. they encode a thaumatin, a patatin-like phospholipase, a heat shock protein, two lipid transfer protein family members, a phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase, a wall associated kinase receptor-like protein, an f-box and leucine-rich repeat protein, a heat shock transcription factor, four myb transcription factors, a wrky transcription factor and an ap2-like ethylene responsive transcription factor. of those  <dig> selected genes,  <dig> showed significant up-regulation in both transgenic lines compared to wt in the control condition, whereas only  <dig> in the heat treatment condition . two myb transcription factors  were induced in the wt in response to heat. also, in concurrence with the rnaseq data , some genes up-regulated in one transgenic line  in the heat stress comparison displayed decreased expression when comparing heat and control samples . despite this, most genes showed higher expression in both transgenic lines compared to wt under hs . these results confirm the transcript abundance of deg from the rnaseq assay and suggest that the profile of induced genes in the osmyb <dig> lines may be related to the improved heat tolerance.fig.  <dig> expression of selected genes identified by rnaseq in transgenic lines. relative transcript levels  of grmzm2g <dig> ; ac <dig> _fg <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig> ; ac <dig> _fg <dig> ; ac <dig> _fg <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig> ; ac <dig> _fg <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig> ; ac <dig> _fg <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig> ; grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig> . bars indicate mean relative expression values ± se asterisks indicate significant differences between transgenic  and wild type  plants and letters between heat-treated and control plants 



several genes up-regulated in osmyb <dig> transgenic maize are also associated with drought responses
the possible role of osmyb <dig> in modulating expression of genes involved in responses to abiotic stress especially drought was further investigated by analyzing go terminology of the deg comparison under control conditions. out of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in the transgenic maize line ,  <dig> genes were classified by agrigo as belonging to go: <dig> . in addition,  <dig> genes were identified as being up-regulated at least in one drought transcriptome study in maize reported in the literature . moreover, a literature search provided further information for  <dig> genes in maize or for their orthologs in rice or other species. in those cases, a significant number of genes have been described to be induced by drought or to confer stress tolerance when over-expressed . in that gene list, nine of them encode transcription factors and  <dig> encode chromatin-related proteins . other genes are associated with hormone signaling, oxidative stress and defense responses.

osmyb <dig> transgenic maize shows tolerance to heat and drought stress
the above results of the transcriptome analysis led us to further evaluate the response of plants expressing osmyb <dig> to hs, drought and the combination of these stresses. five-week-old plants of three independent lines and wt plants grown under controlled conditions were subjected to water withholding or high temperature treatment or both for five days before evaluation of growth and physiological parameters. even though visual differences were noticeable between the genotypes , variations in some parameters were statistically significant only in certain cases. all three treatments caused reduction of water content in wt plants however less significant reduction was observed in transgenic lines under hs . plant growth and chlorophyll content were also reduced in all genotypes in all three conditions . significant differences in plant height and leaf damage were observed between the transgenic lines and wt under hs, whereas significant differences in stem diameter, chlorophyll content and leaf damage were observed between all three genotypes under combined stress. only one transgenic line  displayed more fresh and dry biomass than wt under hs. in the drought treatment, all lines presented higher chlorophyll content and dry biomass than wt . consistent with the observed leaf damage, all three transgenic lines accumulated less malondihaldehyde  than wt in all stress conditions, although differences were only significant under hs and combined stress . after the treatments, the remaining plants from the drought and hs groups were allowed and were able to recover . while all genotypes presented similar growth in the control group, the three transgenic lines exhibited higher biomass than wt in both the drought and hs groups , magnifying the effects of the stress treatments and the differences between the genotypes. plants in the combined hs and drought treatment group were not considered in this case because the additive effect of the same intensity and duration of stresses was too severe to allow plants to fully recover.fig.  <dig> phenotype of maize osmyb <dig> transgenic plants subjected to drought and heat stress. five-week old wild type  and over-expression plants  were grown under a control conditions, b water withholding, c high temperature  or d subjected to water withholding and high temperature as described in methods. picture was taken five days after treatments. control plants were watered and maintained at normal temperatures  during the experiment. e relative water content at the end of the treatment. f malondihaldehyde  accumulation in leaves as indication of stress-induced oxidative damage. bars represent mean values ± se . p-values  are indicated: **p <  <dig>  and *p <  <dig>

to further characterize the phenotype of the transgenic plants in response to drought in more advanced vegetative stages, an experiment was designed where the control of water availability was privileged over that of ambient temperature . eight-week-old plants were subjected to water withholding for five days and then allowed to fully recover, which was attained by all genotypes after 3– <dig> days. to assess the plants’ physiological condition, water potential , leaf temperature  and normalized difference vegetation index  were measured. reduction of water potential occurred gradually in all genotypes but was slower in the osmyb <dig> lines which lost between  <dig> and 50 % of water potential compared to that of well-watered plants after 4 days without irrigation, whereas wt plants lost twice as much water potential as their respective controls. this difference in water status remained significant in all three transgenic lines one day after recovery . the superior water status of the transgenic lines could be an indication of a higher transpiration rate compared to wt. this was further evaluated by measuring the depression of temperature in fully expanded leaves relative to well-watered plants. the osmyb <dig> lines exhibited better evaporative cooling of the leaves than wt from the start of the water stress regime and presented up to  <dig>  °c less increment in temperature compared to wt. this difference was less evident after recovery .fig.  <dig> physiological parameters of maize osmyb <dig> transgenic plants subjected to drought stress in greenhouse conditions. eight-week-old wild type  and osmyb <dig> lines  grown in greenhouse were subjected to water withholding for five days and then re-watered as described in methods. a reduction in water potential of stressed plants compared to well-watered controls. b difference of leaf temperature in stressed and control plants. c reduction of the normalized difference vegetation index  values in stressed plants compared to controls. all measurements were performed in the upper, fully expanded leaves. data shown are for  <dig>   <dig> and 4 days of no irrigation and 1 day after recovery. bars represent mean values ± se . p-values  are indicated: **p <  <dig>  and *p <  <dig> 



for assessing senescence and green area affected by stress, foliar reflectance was measured as another non-destructive phenotyping parameter. based on the light absorbed in the visible versus the near infrared bands of the spectrum, several vegetation indices were calculated including simple ratio index, normalized difference vegetation index , green ndvi, soil adjusted vegetation index, and triangular vegetation index. because ndvi is the most common vegetation index used and is considered a sensitive indicator of green biomass, green leaf area and vigor  <cit> , it was selected to illustrate the results . reduction of the ndvi occurred right from the start of the experiment and was lower in the transgenic lines compared to wt. those lines with significant less affected ndvi also exhibited better index during the early recovery phase . all four calculated indices produced similar trends and differences between the genotypes and throughout the treatment . overall, the physiological parameters indicated that the water stress treatment affected wt plants more than osmyb <dig> lines, suggesting increased tolerance to water deficit of the latter group.

discussion
plant transcription factors are key regulators of almost all aspects of plant growth and development as well as for responses to stress conditions. hsfs are the major group of transcription regulators involved in hs response  <cit>  however independent studies have consistently identified other groups of transcription factors that respond to hs in cereals, including the myb-type family  <cit> . in this work, we show that over-expression of osmyb <dig> in maize improves plant tolerance to high temperature and water stress during vegetative growth and whole-genome transcript profiling identified transcripts and physiological processes that may contribute to their performance under stress.

heat stress and drought tolerant phenotype of osmyb <dig> transgenic maize
plant growth and yield depend on the efficiency of photosynthesis and metabolism to produce biomass. under hs or drought, the integrity of the plant’s physiology is compromised by the onset of oxidative stress and alteration of water relations, causing reduction of photosynthesis and impairment of redox homeostasis  <cit> . the reduced leaf damage and mda accumulation in osmyb <dig> lines  suggest that these transgenic plants may have enhanced cell membrane stability and ros scavenging ability under hs conditions. this is likely due to the activation of endogenous ros-scavenging systems or other defense responses . compared to c <dig> plants, maize is generally more capable of sustaining growth under high temperatures due to a greater antioxidant capacity. it has been reported that the expression and activities of ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase, as well as contents of reduced ascorbate and glutathione, are higher in maize plants compared to those in wheat and rice, before and after being exposed to hs  <cit> . however, as for rice  <cit> , an increase of 12–13 °c in temperature decelerated growth of maize plants. it should be noted that even though leaf damage was more pronounced in wt under combined hs and drought , such conditions were exceedingly harsh for all genotypes, making recovery impossible. during hs, plants open their stomata to reduce leaf temperature through transpiration. however, when hs is combined with water deficit, plants tend to close stomata and the leaf temperature remains high  <cit> . under drought, we found that osmyb <dig> plants were able to maintain cooler leaves with a better water potential status than wt plants , which would be a desired trait when both heat and drought are present in field conditions. the better capacity of the osmyb <dig> transgenic lines to preserve a functional photosynthetic apparatus under a single stress condition may also reflect an improved antioxidant defense system against abiotic stresses.

the effects of hs and drought treatments were consistent in each case among all transgenic lines tested. however more significant differences in growth parameters and leaf damage were apparent between the osmyb <dig> lines and wt plants under hs than in the drought assay . it is possible that some of the genes activated by osmyb <dig> are associated more with cellular functions for overcoming hs than with water deficit; although significantly less water loss was observed in the transgenic lines under hs . nonetheless, reduced mda accumulation in transgenic lines occurred in all stress conditions and the difference with wt plants was more pronounced under combined stress . this observation together with the regulation and possible roles of deg in the transgenic lines suggest that both treatments may be triggering common physiological responses.

in general, cereals are more sensitive to environmental changes at the reproductive stage; hence more studies are focused on the mechanisms of heat response in reproductive tissues. interestingly, a transcriptome analysis of rice panicle at anther developmental stage after heat treatment revealed that the response involve similar processes to those occurring in vegetative tissues . the study also shows that in addition to the regulation of ros-related genes, maintenance of ros levels in rice panicles is also relevant to maintain ros balance  <cit> . it would be interesting to evaluate the effect of hs in the reproductive tissues of osmyb <dig> maize lines. unfortunately, maize yield parameters are frequently unable to be assessed under greenhouse conditions and we were not able to field test these lines due to regulatory restraints.

transcriptome analysis of osmyb <dig> maize: interpreting possible functional elements
go analysis determined similar enrichment of stress-related biological processes in both transgenic and wt maize in response to hs . to understand the improved tolerance in these lines, the genes associated with stress responses were analyzed. the analysis revealed that several up-regulated genes under normal conditions in transgenic maize were also highly up-regulated in wt plants in response to hs, and other stress-related genes were also significantly up-regulated in the transgenic line in the heat treatment comparison . one essential group comprised transcription factors. most type a and type b hsfs respond to hs, however some also are induced by drought, cold or salt stress  <cit> . analysis of deg in the osmyb <dig> transgenic line only identified one type b <dig> hsf  to be up-regulated both in control conditions and by hs . the same gene was reported to be induced by heat, drought and salt stress  <cit> . hsfs can also be activated by other transcription factors. it has been shown that a heat-induced hsfa <dig> in arabidopsis is regulated by the ap2-type transcription factors dreb2a and dreb2b  <cit> . despite a typical association of dreb transcription factors with dehydration and cold responses, cross regulation of drebs with other signals seem to unravel new links between heat responses with drought and osmotic stress  <cit> . among the deg in the osmyb <dig> transgenic line , a c2h <dig> zinc finger protein,  has been shown to be induced by drought and to regulate dreb1b  <cit> . the list of deg also includes three members of the ap2/erebp transcription factor family . wrky transcription factors have also been described to contribute to tolerance to heat, drought, cold and salt stress in rice, wheat, barley and soybean . in the osmyb <dig> line, two wrky proteins were up-regulated, but orthologs of only one  have been described to be induced by stress and to confer drought tolerance when overexpressed  <cit> . but perhaps the most represented family of transcription factors that distinguishes the transgenic maize line from wt was the myb group. five genes encoding myb proteins were up-regulated in the transgenic line in control conditions and four of them when the heat treatment was compared , suggesting important participation of these regulators in the response to hs. besides osmyb <dig>  only three other examples  have identified myb factors as mediators of responses to hs  <cit> . mybs have also been included among transcription factors affecting responses to water deficit  <cit> . interestingly, none of the mybs up-regulated in osmyb <dig> maize or putative orthologs have been implicated in drought responses . it is reasonable to presume that osmyb55-induced protective actions against oxidative stress are also contributing against the negative effects caused by water deficit.

among other gene classes, only one gene related to hsp  was identified as differentially expressed in the osmyb <dig> line compared to wt, indicating that expression of most hsps in response to hs were similar in both genotypes. grmzm2g <dig> encodes an atp-dependent clp protease which is related to chaperone hsp <dig> with a weak similarity to athsp <dig>  a clpb chaperonin required for thermotolerance  <cit> . a thaumatin  was highly up-regulated in osmyb <dig> maize. thaumatins are usually implied in plant biotic stress interactions but have also been reported to be induced by abiotic stress including heat  <cit> . over-expression of a cotton thaumatin gene, gbtlp <dig>  with a potential role in secondary cell wall development, showed enhanced resistance against different stresses including drought and salinity  <cit> . another up-regulated gene encodes a wall-associated receptor-like kinase . waks can function as links between intracellular compartments and the extracellular environment and are thought to have a role in cell elongation, development and stress responses  <cit> . down-regulation of wak <dig> in rice affects root growth and produces dwarf plants and male sterility  <cit>  whereas in barley it also affects root phenotypes in plants grown under control and stress conditions  <cit> . other group of up-regulated genes in osmyb <dig> maize may be more implicated in responses to oxidative stress, such as two lipid transfer proteins . ltps are known for their involvement in stresses as well as biological processes such as cutin biosynthesis  <cit>  though evidence on their role in heat stress is limited. a wheat ltp <dig> gene has been shown to enhance oxidative stress and thermotolerance of arabidopsis plants  <cit> . transcript levels of a gene encoding an adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase  were also up-regulated in osmyb <dig> maize and furthermore sulfate assimilation and phosphate acquisition were among the pathways enriched in the transgenic line under hs . apr is a key enzyme of sulfate assimilation and its mrna levels increases upon oxidative stress and salt treatment in a gibberellin-dependent manner  <cit> . sulfur-containing compounds are involved in plant stress defense however little is known about the mechanisms of stress-regulated sulfate metabolism. it is plausible that sulfate metabolism may play a role in heat stress tolerance of osmyb <dig> transgenic maize. the transcriptome analysis did not detect specific activation of the genes involved in amino acid metabolism reported for rice over-expressing osmyb <dig>  <cit> , which points to differences in gene regulatory networks relevant for heat stress response between these two species.

pathways involving hormones, antioxidants and osmo-solutes also contribute to thermotolerance  <cit> . for example, treatments with aba, sa and 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid  can reduce heat-induced reduce ros accumulation and lipid peroxidation  <cit>  and cytokinin levels also can modify the enzymatic antioxidant defenses against heat stress and drought  <cit> . it was shown that modulation of cytokinin levels influences the control of leaf water potential and stomatal conductance and leads to an enhanced heat and drought tolerance in tobacco plants  <cit> . in addition, expression of a cytokinin glycosyltransferase has been shown to improve drought stress adaptation  <cit> . go terms related to cytokinin signaling  and conjugation  were among those enriched in osmyb <dig> transgenic maize. whether osmyb <dig> mediates gene expression of hormonal signals that respond to stress remains to be investigated. lastly, one of the highly heat-induced genes in osmyb <dig> maize encodes a patatin-like phospholipase  which belongs to a group of phospholipases that have been described as mediators of hormone signaling associated to responses to abiotic stress  <cit> .

an interesting finding in the transcriptome analysis was the enrichment of go terms related to dna replication, nucleosome assembly and microtubule-based processes in the transgenic line . these are important processes for cell division and gene regulation. chromatin remodeling involving histone dynamics in nucleosomes can trigger transcriptional regulation of thermal response in plants . a significant study on this topic described that, under high temperature, eviction of the histone h2a.z from nucleosomes facilitates transcription of target genes involved in the thermosensory activation of flowering  <cit> . it is still unclear however, whether expression of heat-induced genes required for thermo-tolerance  can be regulated in the same fashion. nonetheless, it was established that the same h2a.z gene determines heat stress effects on grain yield in brachypodium  <cit> . recently, a gene encoding a trnahis guanylyl transferase  was identified to be required for plant growth at high temperatures in arabidopsis. ica <dig> mutants present enhanced sensitivity to dna damage, a defect in g2/m transition and down regulation of cell cycle genes under high temperatures  <cit> . perhaps not surprisingly, of  <dig> up-regulated genes in osmyb <dig> maize and with possible roles in drought tolerance , five of them encode histones previously identified as drought responsive and six encode minichromosome maintenance complex  subunits which are involved in assuring complete and accurate dna replication during each cell cycle and also implicated in abiotic stress responses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome analysis of maize over-expressing osmyb <dig> revealed up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in general defense responses and abiotic stress, including hs and drought, suggesting that those plants may be using signaling pathways and genetic and epigenetic regulations common to responses to various stress conditions. deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying these functional genes will aid to better understand stress tolerance and to select strategies for improving crop productivity facing climate change scenarios.
