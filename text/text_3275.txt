BACKGROUND
the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum undergoes a  <dig> h life cycle from the moment of red blood cell invasion through to the production and release of mature progeny. in the course of this intraerythrocytic developmental cycle , the mrna level for many genes rises and falls once at a point that correlates with the time its protein product is needed. such results have led to the proposal of a “just in time” model of plasmodial gene expression in which mrnas accumulate just as their products are required during the idc  <cit>  many factors affect mrna levels, including transcriptional initiation, transcriptional elongation, mrna processing, mrna export, and mrna stability. while control of plasmodium gene expression at the level of transcription has been demonstrated , several recent studies provide evidence that post-transcriptional mechanisms must play a major role as well. for example, p. falciparum shows a widespread chromatin opening and histone h2a.z recruitment in the intergenic regions throughout the idc. although this modification has been associated with actively transcribed chromatin in other species, in plasmodium falciparum this histone variant is also recruited early to genes whose transcripts do not appear until much later . a similar disconnect is seen with component of the basal transcriptional machinery, tbp and tfiie, which are broadly recruited to plasmodium genes regardless of corresponding transcript abundance  <cit> . moreover, nuclear run-ons correlated active transcription of some selected genes with the levels of their transcripts across the idc. while some loci showed clear positive correlation between transcriptional activity and mrna abundance, others revealed striking discrepancies strongly indicative of post-transcriptional regulation  <cit>  and consistent with similar discordances seen in humans  <cit> . additionally, transcript stability has been demonstrated to vary by an average of six fold between ring and schizont stages, and is correlated with a progressive loss of rna degrading enzymes  <cit> . last, parasites deficient in the post-transcriptional regulator caf <dig> display major shifts in peaks of mrna accumulation  <cit> . such findings are consistent with major post-transcriptional control during the idc.

during transcription, many steps of mrna synthesis and processing are integrated through the c-terminal domain  of the largest subunit of rnapii . a hallmark of rpb <dig> in most eukaryotes is the presence of a repeating heptapeptide motif in the ctd  <cit> . in most eukaryotes, the heptad repeat has the consensus sequence ysptsps and is present in many copies ranging from  <dig> in humans to  <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae. moreover, the number and sequence of repeats is highly invariant within and even between species. by contrast, the ctd of plasmodium spp. differs by the inclusion of a lysine at position  <dig> of the heptad repeat , contains fewer repeats and shows much greater variability in repeat number between and within plasmodium species  <cit> .

among other modifications, the serine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> , can be phosphorylated and intensive effort has gone into trying to understand the role of these modifications in gene expression. much attention has focused on the functional consequences of an unphosphorylated ctd, mono-phosphorylation at position  <dig> , and di-phosphorylation at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . a long-held model proposes that the enzymatic activity of rnapii is determined by the phosphorylation status of the ctd. in this model, rnapii bearing a hypophosphorylated ctd is enzymatically inert, while ser5-p is required for rnapii to initiate transcription, and ser2/5-p then confers the elongating and highly processive activity of rnapii  <cit> . however, a revised model suggests that the phosphorylation status of the ctd may simply be a correlative marker of rnapii activity  <cit> . thus, while the exact functions of phosphorylation events at the ctd are a matter of debate, there is a strong consensus that the presence of ser5-p and especially ser2/5-p are marks of transcriptionally active polymerase.

we have exploited the phosphorylation state of the rnapii ctd to assess the engagement of most p. falciparum genes with the transcriptional machinery across the idc. this allowed us to assess the extent to which rnapii occupancy correlates with the mrna accumulation. our data indicate that p. falciparum genes are divided into two classes depending on whether peak rnapii binding occurs early or late during the idc. when comparing rnapii occupancy to mrna abundance, we identified subsets of genes with high occupancy and relatively low rna levels and vice versa. we find that genes at which rnapii is detected early ) are shorter in length, have more introns and shorter first exons when compared to genes at which rnapii is detected late . furthermore, we find distinct rnapii occupancy patterns for the early and late genes along the gene length. comparison of rnapii occupancy with various histone modifications identifies chromatin changes that precede, accompany and follow rnapii recruitment. together our results show that occupancy by presumed active forms of rnapii cannot account for the highly orchestrated pattern of mrna accumulation and loss over the idc. we suggest that post-initiation mechanisms such as transcriptional elongation and mrna stability may play predominant roles in determining the dynamics of mrna abundance during infection of red blood cells.

RESULTS
production of monoclonal antibodies specific for three forms of the ctd of the large subunit of rnapii
steps in the generation and use of monoclonal antibodies in this study are summarized in figure 1a. to examine the genome-wide distribution of rnapii, we raised highly specific monoclonal antibodies against three forms of the p. falciparum rpb <dig> ctd: unmodified ctd, ser5-p-bearing ctd, and ctd having the ser2/5-p double phosphorylation. the phosphorylated forms of rpb <dig> have been associated with rnapii molecules that are functionally engaged with bound genes. unphosphorylated heptad repeats may be associated with inert forms of the polymerase, but could also be present as one or more copies within a ctd that also contains phosphorylated motifs. the specificity of the antibodies was confirmed in several ways. first, the antibodies showed high specificity in elisa by serial dilution  and, second, by competition with the immunizing peptide in a peptide competition assay . these results establish that each antibody specifically recognizes its cognate peptide and not the other two. third, the appropriate sized band for p. falciparum rbp <dig> is also observed on western blot of nuclear lysates following immunoprecipitation using each of the three monoclonal antibodies . a well-characterized commercially available antibody  that recognizes unphosphorylated and ser5-p ctd  <cit>  likewise detects a similarly sized band corresponding to rpb <dig> in a western blot of cell lysate. although all antibodies  detect additional bands, stringent washing leaves a unique band corresponding to the expected molecular weight of rpb <dig> as the major species detected by the αser2/5-p antibody . fourth, ip followed by mass spectrometry revealed that both the αser5-p and αser2/5-p antibodies precipitated rpb <dig> as well as two additional subunits of rnapii, namely rpb <dig> and rpb <dig>  with high confidence. no rnapii subunits were precipitated by a control igg . together, these results show that these antibodies are specific for the ctd of rpb <dig> in p. falciparum and are suitable for use in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay .figure  <dig>

rna polymerase ii shows a bi-phasic binding distribution across the p. falciparumidc
we next used these p. falciparum anti-rnapii antibodies in chip-on-chip analysis to map the position and enzymatic status of rnapii across the entire p. falciparum genome over the  <dig> h of the idc at  <dig> h intervals. the commercial anti-ctd antibody, 8wg <dig>  was also used in parallel. we used custom-made microarrays spotted with 70-mer oligonucleotides covering both coding and intergenic regions  <cit> .

following hybridization and analysis of the microarrays, we selected all those probes exhibiting a significantly oscillating profile with p < <dig>  and ≥ <dig>  fold change across the life cycle. this cut-off resulted in the retention of a subset of probes for each of the three antibodies:  <dig>  probes with the αctd  antibody;  <dig>  probes with the αser5-p antibody; and  <dig>  probes with the αser2/5-p antibody. we addressed the temporal order within the dataset by creating a phaseogram of rnapii occupancy. the genome-wide profiles reveal a striking periodicity involving the majority of genes . most genes can be divided in two groups: those that bind rnapii early during the idc and those that bind rnapii late, regardless of the phosphorylation state of the ctd. this division into early versus late is most dramatic for the ser2/5-p form of rnapii which is the elongating form of the polymerase. the data show a striking switch between t <dig>  and t <dig>  such that the ser2/5-p form binds maximally to one large fraction of genes early in the idc until t <dig> , but then switches to a largely mutually exclusive set of genes late in infection during t <dig> and t <dig> . only 11% of genes are present in both categories due to differential signals from probes within the same gene. a similar observation is made for data sets obtained with the other two antibodies against the unmodified ctd and the ser5-p; however, the switch between early and late binding profiles for these two forms occurs earlier between t <dig>  and t <dig> . differential occupancy of the different forms of rnapii argues against a bias inherent to the experimental procedure or the microarrays themselves. importantly, chip-on-chip with the commercial 8wg <dig> antibody likewise revealed a segregation of early vs late signals for the majority of probes in a pattern resembling those obtained with the α-ctd and α-ser5-p antibodies . this is consistent with the demonstration that 8wg <dig> recognizes the unmodified and ser5-p forms of the heptad repeat  <cit> . hierarchical clustering of the datasets also highlights the distinct distribution of rnapii in just two prominent groups, one dominated by loci where rnapii binds early in the idc and another dominated by loci where the binding is late . the timings of the switches are identical to those revealed in the phaseograms.

to confirm results obtained by microarray, we performed chip-qpcr at each of the six time points for six genes that bind the elongating  form of rnapii early in the idc and four that bind late. although qpcr reveals a greater dynamic range than the microarray analysis, the results show that all early genes acquire peak rnapii recruitment early in the idc at either time point  <dig> or  <dig> , while late genes do not display maximal rnapii binding until time point  <dig>  . these findings strongly validate the results of chip-on-chip and confirm the presence of two gene classes distinguished by early or late enrichment in rnapii binding over the course of the idc.figure  <dig>

relationship between transcriptional activity and mrna abundance
to characterize the relationship between the genome-wide binding of distinct forms of rnapii and mrna abundance, we calculated the pearson’s correlation coefficient  between the dynamic rnapii occupancy  and the expression levels of corresponding mrnas. we established two subsets . in one subset, increased rnapii occupancy  was positively correlated with high mrna levels . in the other subset, the correlation was negative, meaning that there was either high mrna expression without detectable rnapii binding, or that we observed rnapii binding without corresponding mrna expression. with respect to the ser2/5-p isoform of rnapii,  <dig>  probes were highly positively correlated with gene expression , while  <dig>  probes were strongly negatively correlated  . similar observations were also made with the unmodified ctd and ser5-p isoforms of rnapii  as well as with the 8wg <dig> commercial antibody . approximately a third of the probes showed no significant correlation. the above results thus reveal four subsets of genes with respect to rnapii occupancy and mrna abundance: genes which bind rnapii early and are either positively or negatively correlated with mrna levels , and genes which bind rnapii late .figure  <dig> 
relationship between rnapii occupancy and mrna abundance. correlation between the genome-wide detection of unmodified ctd , ser5-p  and ser2/5-p  forms of rnapii and mrna levels was calculated using pearson’s correlation coefficient  between the mean-centered profile of all probes with p < <dig>  and the corresponding gene transcripts. the data have been presented as bar graphs with bins of pcc ranging from − <dig> to + <dig> on the x-axis plotted against the number of probes falling into each bin on the y-axis. the phaseograms in the right-hand panels represent probes which are highly positively correlated with gene expression , and in the left-hand panels display probes showing negative correlation with gene expression . one-third of the probes do not show any correlation. the order of the probes represented in the phaseograms for rnapii binding is the same as those used in the mrna phaseogram. on the basis of this analysis, we identify four subsets of genes with respect to the correlation between rnapii binding and mrna abundance. these are early/positive , early/negative and late/positive and late/negative.



we assessed the genomic characteristics of rnapii-ser2/5-p-associated early and late genes. we mapped the genes that showed either early or late binding of rnapii ser2/5-p onto the  <dig> p. falciparum chromosomes. all chromosomes were seen to bear potential clusters ; however, closer examination revealed that genes within such clusters do not share a common expression profile, arguing against any functional organization and consistent with a previous study suggesting that p. falciparum lacks chromosomal domains with common expression profiles  <cit> . we mapped several genomic descriptors known to associate with gene expression regulation in human  <cit> , including gene length, gc content, number of introns and intron length. we found that genes binding rnapii ser2/5-p at early times  are short with lower gc content by comparison to late genes  which are significantly longer . in addition, the early genes had a greater number of introns when compared to late genes . the presence of introns has been linked to higher transcriptional efficiency  <cit> . we assessed the length of the first exon and found that late genes have longer first exons when compared to early genes . thus, early-transcribed genes are shorter in length, have more introns and shorter first exons. short gene length and short first exons are properties of highly expressed genes in human cells  <cit> .

differential distribution of rnapii along the transcription unit distinguishes genes binding rnapii early vs late in the idc
according to one model of ctd function, phosphorylation of ser <dig> residues predominates near the promoter, whereas toward the end of the gene rnapii is extensively phosphorylated on ser <dig> residues  <cit> . to explore the phosphorylation status of the ctd at different positions along the transcription unit, we examined the distribution of the three forms of rnapii along the gene for each of the four classes, namely early and late binders that positively correlated with the mrna levels  and early and late binders that negatively correlated with mrna levels . we observed very distinct profiles for genes that show a positive correlation between mrna levels and peak rnapii binding either early or late in the idc. promoter regions in p. falciparum are predicted to lie between  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of the atg  <cit> . rnapii accumulates in the promoter region of early binders, whereas for late binders rnapii is enriched in the gene body . likewise, the ser2/5-p form of rnapii was concentrated within upstream presumptive promoter regions  of genes expressed early and negatively correlating with mrna levels . on the other hand, the unmodified  and ser5-p forms did not obviously follow this distribution. a goodness-of-fit test assigns a significant p value  to the difference in rnapii distribution  between early and late binders  suggesting that the transcriptional process in early vs late phases may be distinguished by mechanistic differences. however, it is possible that this has more to do with the transcription of shorter vs longer genes or the coupling of the splicing machinery to the ctd, since “late” genes are longer and have fewer introns, as noted above.

to determine whether the observed differential recruitment of rnapii at early vs. late times of infection also reflects functional gene classes, we mapped early and late genes to known pathways and determined which pathways are over-represented in each group by using three pathway databases, namely gene ontology , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and malaria parasite metabolic pathway  . we found that early genes were significantly enriched at loci associated with growth , metabolism , and transcription and splicing. as expected, late genes were significantly enriched in proteins involved in host-parasite interactions and pathogenesis  and cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis.figure  <dig>

relationship between rnapii occupancy and chromatin modifications
our group and others have shown that chromatin influences gene expression in p. falciparum
. to examine the relationship between rnapii occupancy and chromatin modification, we calculated the pcc  between dynamic rnapii occupancy of unmodified ctd, ser5-p and ser2/5-p and  <dig> histone modifications determined in our previous study  <cit> . we identified  <dig> histone marks including h3k9ac, h3k56ac, h4ac <dig>  h4k12ac and h4k20me <dig> which showed clear positive correlation with ser2/5-p rnapii binding at high statistical confidence . all these histone modifications, in addition to h3k4me <dig>  associate with transcriptionally active protein coding genes and are described as active marks  <cit> , and references therein.figure  <dig>

to determine whether some histone modifications may precede or follow rnapii recruitment, we calculated the pcc  between rnapii occupancy  and histone modification occurring  <dig> h before or after recruitment . for example, recruitment of each form of rnapii at t <dig>  was assessed relative to histone modifications occurring  <dig> h earlier at t <dig> , and  <dig> h later at t <dig> , and so on for all six time points. for all forms of rnapii, we found that some histone marks precede, accompany or follow rnapii recruitment. thus, the activating histone mark h3k9ac precedes  recruitment of all forms of rnapii . other marks are specific for one or more of the rnapii isoforms. thus, h4k16ac, a mark of actively transcribed euchromatin  <cit> , and h4k5ac which has been shown to “bookmark” genes for rapid activation  <cit> , show clear positive correlations with subsequent recruitment of the ser2/5-p form of rnapii . by contrast, both h3k4me <dig> and h4r3me <dig> show positive correlation with these histone modifications following recruitment of ser2/5-p rnapii. conversely, h4r3me <dig>  associated with repression of gene expression  <cit> , shows clear negative correlation with subsequent recruitment of all forms of rnapii , while h4k5ac was depleted  <dig> h following recruitment of the rnapiiser2/5-p form . both the positive and negative correlations are highly statistically significant by the kolmogorov-smirnov test . other histone modifications were not seen to anticipate or follow rnapii recruitment .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we performed genome-wide mapping of rnapii occupancy over the  <dig> h of the idc using a chip-on-chip approach. we used three highly specific monoclonal antibodies against different forms of the p. falciparum rbp <dig> ctd in addition to 8wg <dig>  a well-characterized commercial monoclonal antibody raised against wheat germ rnapii and likewise recognizing the ctd  <cit> . all four antibodies gave highly similar results. we observed that the parasite’s idc is divided into early and late phases of rnapii occupancy. maximal binding by the forms of rnapii bearing unmodified and ser5-p modified heptads  switches from one large set of genes to another between t <dig>  and t <dig> , while that of the ser2/5-p form does so between t <dig> and t <dig> . this is the first indication of which we are aware that the plasmodium life cycle is divided into rather stark early vs. late stages defined by a component of the transcriptional machinery.

considerable controversy has surrounded the role of the ctd heptad repeats and their phospho-serines. while the heptad repeats are necessary for the survival of yeast and human cells, they are dispensable for transcription in vitro
 <cit> 
. in addition, the loss of ser <dig> phosphorylation does not affect the transcription of the majority of genes in fission yeast, while the budding yeast kinase kin28p is not required for transcription but rather to couple transcription initiation to the capping process  <cit> . these and other observations have led to the suggestion that the heptad repeats are not required for transcription per se, but rather to bind and coordinate the activity of proteins exerting co-transcriptional functions such as capping and splicing  <cit> . apicomplexans are within the branch of eukaryotes stemming from an ancestor bearing ctd heptad repeats. however, the severe reduction in repeat number in basal plasmodium species suggests that heptad repeats were first lost in plasmodium spp and then re-acquired in primate-infecting lineages  <cit> . this raises the possibility that the heptad repeats of p. falciparum play roles entirely unrelated to those of their counterparts in other species, or at least unrelated to transcriptional processes. this seems unlikely for several reasons. first, p. falciparum encodes an almost complete set  of so-called core ctd-interacting proteins with major transcriptional functions  <cit> . second, p. falciparum encodes a clear homolog of the yeast ctk <dig> kinase in part responsible for ser <dig> phosphorylation   <cit>  and another kinase displaying striking similarity to human cdk <dig> responsible for phosphorylation at ser <dig> . third, as revealed by our antibodies, both serines  <dig> and  <dig> of the p. falciparum ctd are phosphorylated in vivo. fourth, an alternative register and alignment of the functional heptad unit suggests that basal plasmodium species may harbor more units of full and partial heptads than previously appreciated  <cit> , suggesting that interactions between the ctd and its partners were never lost in these organisms. fifth, the evolution of exclusively new functions for the ctd should be accompanied by the evolution of a new motif, not the same heptad motif already implicated in earlier functions. together, these observations argue that the evolution of a completely new set of functions for the heptad repeats is less parsimonious than the re-establishment  of interactions with partners previously selected in the course of evolution. the above argument does not preclude, however, that the p. falciparum ctd may have also acquired novel functions and interaction partners.

at a minimum for the interpretation of our results, it seems reasonable to expect that the presence of phosphorylated serines in the ctd is indicative of rnapii that is actively engaged in transcription. we find a similar distribution of rnapii bearing unmodified and phosphorylated heptads. similar observations have been made by several groups and can be explained simply by the presence of one or more unmodified heptads in the company of other phosphorylated repeats within a ctd  <cit> . because all the antibodies used in this study find their epitopes in the ctd, it remains possible that we have failed to detect rnapii sub-populations bearing alternative modifications of this domain. the use of an anti-rnapii antibody directed against a domain that is not subject to extensive modification and which is evolutionarily stable would therefore provide a useful complement to our results.

it may be particularly insightful to compare our results with those of two previous studies. one report used the nuclear run-on assay to assess the engagement of rnapii at several genes across the idc  <cit> . strikingly, some genes showed an inverse correlation between rnapii engagement and mrna levels, consistent with our early-negative and late-negative categories in which rnapii binding, or lack thereof, is not reflected in mrna levels. in another study, chip was used to assess the recruitment of the general transcription factors tbp and tfiie to a number of genes at both ring  and trophozoite  stages . regardless of whether these genes were ring-specific or trophozoite-specific, both tbp and tfiie were present at these genes at both ring and trophozoite stages  <cit> . these findings are consistent with our observed discordance between occupancy by rnapii and the mrna levels for a large subset of genes. however, whereas we find that the parasite genome is largely divided between those genes that recruit rnapii early vs late, tpb and tfiie were found in both rings and trophozoites at genes that are expressed at only one of these stages. at first, these results may seem contradictory, since tfiie binding is expected to follow rnapii recruitment  <cit> . however, as described in yeast, a promoter that has undergone one round of transcriptional initiation remains bound to a complex of general transcription factors referred to as the scaffold or re-initiation complex. the scaffold includes tbp and tfiie, but not rnapii, and has been proposed to prime the promoter for re-initiation  <cit> . it is therefore possible that many erythrocyte-expressed genes of p. falciparum are primed for re-initiation by a tbp- and tfiie-containing scaffold, ready for rnapii recruitment in response to appropriate cues. two of the genes analyzed for tbp and tfiie binding are included in our data set. msp <dig>  and rhoph <dig>  bind tbp and tfiie at both ring and trophozoite stages  <cit> . by contrast, we observe rnapii occupancy at these two genes only late in the idc: the presence of the unmodified ctd form at msp <dig> and the presence of the ser5-p form at rhop <dig> is not observed until t <dig> . both genes then associate with the ser2/5-p form by t <dig>  thus, the appearance of enzymatically active forms of rnapii follows that of tbp and tfiie, at least in these instances. this is consistent with the presence of tbp and tfiie in a scaffold-like complex ready for efficient rnapii recruitment when the time is right.

our data show that rnapii occupancy and the corresponding mrna levels of many genes are well correlated, suggesting that the control of transcription is often a determinant of gene expression. surprisingly, however, a large number of genes achieve significant mrna levels only several hours following their peak rnapii ser2/5-p occupancy , suggesting that transcription is not a rate-limiting step at these loci. one possibility is that rnapii is “pre-loaded” onto such genes but kept in a paused  state. although rnapii levels subsequently fall as mrna levels rise, this may be due to the greater transcriptional activity of fewer polymerase molecules. this would then place a major regulatory control in p. falciparum at the point of transcriptional elongation as has been well documented in other eukaryotes  <cit> . if so, the parasite must have evolved mechanisms to stall rnapii despite the presence of the ser2/5-p modification at the ctd since this form of the polymerase, just as for the unphosphorylated and ser5-p forms, is enriched at a subset of genes at times when their mrna levels are low. the dispensability of ser <dig> phosphorylation for the expression of most genes in fission yeast is consistent with this notion  <cit> . non-exclusively, abundant mrna despite decreased levels of rnapii binding could be due to a switch from labile to stable transcript states, consistent with previous studies demonstrating a large increase in transcript stability over the course of the idc  <cit> .

the highly similar distribution along the gene length of all forms of the polymerase studied here may be consistent with this notion. on the other hand, the apparent distribution of ctd isoforms along the gene in other organisms varies greatly depending on the antibody in use and the presence/absence of modifications adjacent to the epitope . from this perspective, the distributions observed in this study may not be surprising. the ser2/5-p form of rnapii – sometimes described as the elongating form – is enriched upstream of the coding region of “early” genes. while this may be surprising, a similar distribution for rnapii phosphorylated at ser <dig> of the heptad repeat has been observed for a class of genes in schizosaccharomyces pombe
 <cit> .

the division of the idc into early and late phases as evidenced by rnapii occupancy profiles is paralleled by the binary changes  in chromatin structure that occur during the parasite’s life cycle  <cit>  whereby the chromatin opens at the early ring stage, reaching a maximum at the trophozoite stage followed by tight packing in schizonts. the late recruitment of rnapii addresses the apparent contradiction that the parasite chromatin is closed in the late schizont stage despite the appearance of late-stage mrnas. although some mrnas detected in the schizont stage could be regulated at the level of stability, our results show that rnapii recruitment does take place toward the end of the idc, though restricted mostly to loci involved in late-stage-specific processes such as pathogenesis, merozoite maturation and invasion. elucidation of the molecular determinants of this early-late transcriptional switch should provide important insights into fundamental aspects of transcriptional control in p. falciparum.

we previously carried out genome-wide mapping of  <dig> histone modifications and correlated their presence at particular genes with transcript accumulation over the idc. in particular, h4k8ac was tightly linked to mrna levels and accompanied a promoter inserted at an ectopic site in the genome  <cit> . here, we further correlated these histone modifications to rnapii recruitment and to time points both  <dig> h earlier and later. the results reveal distinct chromatin signatures preceding, following and at the time of binding of distinct forms of rnapii. such signatures may reflect the action of the machinery used in rnapii recruitment and maturation, but do not obviously provide insights into the mechanism controlling the early/late switch. interestingly, we did not find a correlation between the peaks of h4k8ac modification and rnapii binding. and while we do observe a correlation between the binding of the ser2/5-p form of rnapii and h3k4me <dig>  maximal levels of this histone mark only follow maximal binding by rnapii ser2/5-p. others have also noted that h3k4me <dig> is not correlated with transcript levels  <cit> . these differences in the timings of h4k8ac and h3k4me <dig> modification, peak mrna levels and maximal recruitment of rnapii ser2/5-p are not consistent with a simple coordinated process of rnapii binding and transcription immediately facilitated by chromatin modification and leading to increased mrna output, and further substantiate a role for post-initiation and post-transcriptional processes in the control of gene expression in p. falciparum.

CONCLUSIONS
the striking contrast between the relatively simple pattern of rnapii recruitment  to approximately two thirds of genes versus the highly orchestrated rise and fall of their transcripts across the idc suggests that mechanisms downstream of transcriptional initiation may play a predominant role in the control of gene expression in p. falciparum. the recent demonstration that the negative regulation of a var gene subgroup in p. falciparum is mediated by a transcriptionally coupled rnase is consistent with this notion and may have broader implications for gene expression in this species more generally  <cit> . limited control at the level of transcription initiation, though rare, would not be unique to malarial parasites. a closely related family of protozoan parasites, trypanosomatids, shows no evidence of developmental control of rna polymerase ii transcription  <cit> . a bias toward post-initiation regulation of gene expression may have been facilitated by the homeostatically controlled environments within human and insect hosts, thereby relieving selective pressure for the retention of fine control at the level of transcription initiation.
