BACKGROUND
until recently the main source of transmission of classical scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy  of sheep, was believed to be the placenta  <cit> . we have previously shown that colostrum and milk collected from scrapie-affected ewes was able to transmit disease when fed to lambs although we were unable to determine whether colostrum or milk alone was infectious and whether lateral transmission between milk recipient lambs may have contributed to the apparently high transmission rate because milk recipient sheep were mixed after all milk had been consumed  <cit> . this previously reported study  utilised cheviot sheep with a prion protein genotype vv136rr154qq <dig>  which in this breed is associated with high scrapie susceptibility  <cit>  and results in accumulation of immunohistochemically detectable disease-associated prion protein  in the lymphoreticular system  at a young age  <cit> . a subsequent study in transgenic mice over-expressing ovine vrq prion protein  demonstrated that both colostrum and milk from vrq/vrq and arq/vrq sheep, after concentrating scrapie prion protein on magnetic beads, were able to transmit scrapie  <cit> . in a separate experiment it was shown that milk from arq/arq sheep orally inoculated with scrapie brain homogenate transmits scrapie to lambs  <cit> . both studies used milk from sheep co-infected with the maedi-visna virus , which can cause lymphofollicular mastitis that may contribute to prion secretion into milk  <cit>  compared to a healthy udder. others used a sensitive prion detection method, protein misfolding cyclic amplification , to test milk from scrapie-exposed sheep and found the presence of scrapie prion protein  in milk of sheep carrying at least one vrq allele  <cit>  although it is not known whether this would lead to disease transmission in a sheep because of the sometimes poor association between prpsc detection and infectivity  <cit> .

the present work was undertaken following the results from the initial study , updated here, to further study scrapie transmission via milk by using the natural host, namely to confirm the high scrapie transmission rate via milk whilst lateral transmission was prevented by housing lambs separately after milk consumption  and to investigate whether colostrum or subsequent milk in a lactation are equally effective in the transmission of scrapie in sheep . in a parallel study, milk samples from sheep, which included milk from some sheep used for the transmission study, were examined for presence of prpsc using pmca to allow comparison with the in vivo studies.

RESULTS
study  <dig>  feeding milk from scrapie infected sheep to lambs with lambs housed together
recipient lambs and lateral transmission controls
all of the  <dig> remaining scrapie milk recipients  developed clinical signs of scrapie and were culled at 19– <dig> months of age  whereas the five lateral transmission controls were culled with signs of scrapie at 27– <dig> months of age . immunohistochemical and western blot examination of the brains confirmed the clinical diagnosis in all sheep . all except for the last culled lateral transmission control, which displayed alopecia with skin lesions and a positive scratch test at the time of cull, presented with vacuolar changes in the obex. this sheep was also the only one that had no detectable prpd in recto-anal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue  at  <dig>  months post exposure although it was present in a further biopsy at  <dig> months of age. the incubation periods of the scrapie-affected milk recipients , lateral transmission controls  to cull) and those of the milk donor sheep are shown in figure  <dig> 

building controls
one building control was lost due to acquired thoracic vertebral malformation at  <dig> months of age. the remaining eight controls were culled at  <dig> months of age, one of which displayed a positive scratch test inconsistently prior to cull although there was no evidence of pruritic behaviour. all sheep were negative for scrapie by immunohistochemical examination of obex, distal ileum, mesenteric lymph node and spleen as well as western blot examination of the caudal medulla.

recipient lambs
ramalt biopsies of the  <dig> lambs were taken at 136– <dig> days of age. this was repeated in three lambs that had less than four follicles in the section examined. it was considered that insufficient tissue had been taken to reach a diagnosis. the results revealed that at least one lamb of each pair was scrapie-positive . five lambs subsequently developed sudden dullness with jaundice and were culled at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> days of age . abundant copper staining in the livers of these lambs using special stains  together with liver copper concentrations of  <dig> - <dig>  mmol/kg compared to normal values of ≤ <dig>  mmol/kg  <cit>  were indicative of chronic copper intoxication. the cause could not be determined: copper levels in selected samples  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/kg, concentrated food also contained the copper-antagonist molybdenum, and other sheep on the premises, which were kept in a different building but fed the same diet, did not develop disease. as a consequence, a 3-month course of  <dig>  g ammonium molybdate and  <dig> g sodium sulphate dissolved in  <dig> ml of water administered daily per os was initiated as prophylactic treatment to enhance excretion of copper and no further cases were observed. all five lambs presented with prpd accumulation in distal ileum, spleen  and mesenteric lymph node but not in the brain. all remaining scrapie milk recipients developed clinical signs of scrapie resulting in their cull at 22– <dig> months of age. scrapie was confirmed by histopathological , immunohistochemical  and western blot examination  of the brains.

building controls
ramalt biopsies taken around the same time from three of the five building controls did not show detectable prpd in the sampled section; the other two sheep were re-sampled  <dig> days later due to insufficient tissue being collected but only one had enough tissue for a diagnosis, which was scrapie-negative . no further biopsies were taken.

controls were culled with no evidence of clinical disease at  <dig> months of age, after the last scrapie milk recipient had been culled and were negative for scrapie by postmortem tests.

milk recipient lambs
one scrapie-milk challenged lamb  developed anaemia and ill-thrift and was culled at  <dig> days of age. this lamb presented with prpd in lymphoid follicles of the distal ileum indicative of early pre-clinical infection . ramalt biopsies of the remaining lambs  were taken at 138– <dig> days of age and repeated for three lambs with less than five follicles in the section examined. at least one lamb of each scrapie colostrum-fed pair and at least one lamb of four of five scrapie milk-fed pairs  were scrapie-positive . at  <dig> days of age, further ramalt biopsies were taken from the scrapie milk-fed pair that had previously been scrapie-negative: prpd was found in ramalt of both sheep.

similar to study  <dig>  three sheep developed jaundice and dullness and were culled: the former companion of the anaemic lamb at  <dig> days of age , a scrapie milk recipient  at  <dig> days and a scrapie colostrum recipient  at  <dig> days of age. detectable prpd was found in distal ileum and mesenteric lymph node , spleen  and obex . all had postmortem findings consistent with chronic copper intoxication , also resulting in hepatic encephalopathy in colostrum recipient 09– <dig>  which presented with severe white matter vacuolation in the obex, particularly in the reticular formation. the source of the intoxication could again not be determined. all remaining sheep were treated orally against copper intoxication as above for  <dig> days after the first occurrence of copper intoxication and for  <dig> days following the second occurrence.

a further sheep  was culled at  <dig> months of age because of malnutrition following the development of marked maxillary prognathism. a detailed clinical examination was not carried out prior to cull but vacuolar changes and prpd accumulation were detected in the brain histopathologically, and western blot examination of the brain revealed prpres.

the remaining  <dig> sheep  were culled with clinical signs of scrapie at 23– <dig> months of age. all presented with vacuolar changes and prpd accumulation in the obex  and prpres was demonstrated by western blot examination of a sample of the caudal medulla.

building controls
ramalt biopsies taken around the same time from the four building controls did not have detectable prpd in the section. no further biopsies were taken. all sheep were clinically healthy when culled at  <dig> months of age and free from scrapie based on postmortem tests.

application of pmca to detect prpsc in milk
detection of prpsc was achieved after serial pmca from all  <dig> milk samples taken from the six vrq/vrq scrapie-affected sheep . the day of lactation did not appear to influence the outcome of the test indicating that scrapie prion protein was present throughout lactation. prpsc was amplified from one milk sample from a scrapie-infected ewe that did not transmit scrapie to a lamb. positive results were also observed in amplified samples from three tests of a total of  <dig> tests performed on  <dig> control milk samples  from five scrapie-free vrq/vrq sheep. these three positive results were not obtained from the same sample or in the same assay and are unlikely to represent infectivity and possible explanations are discussed below.

all scrapie-free sheep were cheviot ewes, sheep 139/ <dig> was a poll dorset × friesland, see table  <dig> for breeds of the other scrapie-affected sheep.

furthermore milk from three a136r <dig> homozygous sheep carrying at least one q <dig> allele  and infected with either bse or scrapie were tested for prpsc by pmca. only the milk from one arq/arq scrapie field case  produced a positive result from the colostrum sample from each udder half. as observed for the vrq controls, two of the  <dig> milk samples  from the arq/arq control sheep also yielded a positive result .

discussion
a recent epidemiological study has found an increased incidence of scrapie in the offspring of scrapie-affected ewes, even after controlling for the confounding effect of prp genotype, which is suggestive of maternal transmission  <cit> . the authors further suggested that if the transmission occurs postnatally it is likely to occur rapidly after birth since early removal and artificial raising of lambs reduced the scrapie incidence only if the dams within a flock with scrapie were healthy and not yet themselves affected by scrapie  <cit> . the present studies  have demonstrated that milk, including colostrum, would cause this scrapie infection in vrq/vrq lambs. although mixing of milk recipients after milk consumption in study  <dig> meant lateral infection could not be ruled out as contributing to a high transmission rate  <cit> , the transmission rate remained 100% in study  <dig> where milk recipients were not mixed after milk consumption confirming that milk is a highly effective vehicle of scrapie transmission. feeding milk or colostrum from scrapie infected sheep separately to different lambs all within  <dig> hours after birth  was shown to be infectious to all lambs, even if as little as  <dig>  litres of colostrum was fed. it is not known whether an equal volume of milk would have been sufficient to transmit disease. a similar volume of milk from pre-clinical scrapie-affected arq/arq sheep was able to infect arq/arq lambs  <cit> , but transmission was only achieved with milk from sheep co-infected with mvv, which produced chronic lymphofollicular mastitis, and not with milk from scrapie-only affected sheep.

since its first publication in  <dig>  <cit>  pmca has become a widely used technique to achieve prpsc detection in fluids from scrapie-affected sheep, which contain amounts of prpsc that were previously undetectable by other tests  <cit> . this technique is based on the phenomenon that minute amounts of prpsc in the sample are able to convert cellular prion protein, which is added as substrate, into the disease-associated form and – by using serial cycles of incubation and sonication – is able to amplify prpsc in quantities that are detectable by rapid postmortem tests. however, on rare occasions prion protein was also detected in samples from non-tse affected animals, and the product was indistinguishable from prpsc. it was hypothesised that this was either the result of de novo generation of prpsc or due to cross-contamination of samples  <cit> . in the current study, prpsc was detected in milk from control sheep, which belonged to a flock that is free from classical scrapie and were thus extremely unlikely to shed prions via milk. in our experimental system it is not known whether these apparently spurious positive data result from contamination or the generation of new prpsc. the inclusion of polya in the reaction renders this methods ultra sensitive and we cannot preclude that extremely small amounts of contamination give rise to these positive samples. nonetheless, the observation that 96% of tests were positive from sheep with milk known to be infectious to lambs is supportive of an association with infectivity. these results were in good agreement with those from the transmission study. one exception was the milk from a single scrapie-affected ewe in study  <dig> , where pmca analysis produced a consistently positive result  in the sample tested, but there was no evidence of scrapie transmission to the recipient  <cit> . although prpd was not found in any of the tissues examined at necropsy when it was culled for other reasons at  <dig> days of age, it may have been too early in the incubation period for prpd accumulation to be detectable in tissues by conventional postmortem tests. however, prpd was detected in lambs culled at an earlier age that were fed different milk samples in this experiment. a similar finding was reported in an oral transmission study of chronic wasting disease  in deer: whilst pmca allowed detection of prpsc in faeces and urine of cwd-affected deer, oral challenge with these excreta did not produce disease within  <dig> months based on conventional postmortem tests, even though pmca and mouse bioassay demonstrated that these animals were subclinically infected  <cit> . further studies would be required to confirm that the milk recipient was indeed infected, e.g. by inoculation of transgenic mice with tissues from the milk recipient.

although the number of tested samples was very small, failure to detect prpsc by pmca in two of three arx/arq scrapie or bse sheep-derived samples, but repeated detection in vrq/vrq scrapie sheep-derived samples, may suggest that shedding of prpsc  is reduced in arx/arq sheep or that other factors, such as strain , genotype  and sensitivity of the pmca may contribute to the observed difference. detection of prpd in the inguinal lymph node was suggestive of widespread prpd dissemination in the body but did not imply that the milk was infectious or harboured prpsc since it was also detected in the lymph node of the arq/arq bse-affected sheep where the milk sample was pmca-negative. furthermore the bse-affected ewe had reared two lambs  for a period of  <dig> days when the milk sample that was tested for prpsc by pmca was taken. both were negative for bse by postmortem tests on brain and lrs tissues when culled at  <dig> months of age . since experimental oral infection of sheep with this genotype usually results in prpd accumulation in lrs tissues before  <dig> months post infection  <cit> , these data would indicate that the milk from this ewe was not infectious, supporting the pmca-negative result.

although feeding of milk from scrapie-affected vrq/vrq sheep was highly effective, scrapie-free sheep introduced to the milk recipient lambs from  <dig> days of age , equally led to infection, with a median incubation period only slightly longer compared to milk-fed sheep. thus, exposure to the infectious agent through other sources than the consumption of infected milk equally contributes to the risk of developing clinical disease. the longer incubation periods of these lateral transmission control sheep may be attributable to their older age when they were exposed to the scrapie environment, the lower infectious titre of the environmental source compared to milk or both. however, incubation periods should generally be interpreted with caution because they rely on defining the clinical end-stage, which is not always clear in sheep due to the variety of expressed clinical signs. for example, the lateral transmission control displayed clinical signs that were perceived as more severe and thus more advanced  than the signs seen in milk-fed sheep where pruritus was the predominant sign.

the cause for the copper toxicity, which resulted in the premature cull of eight sheep in studies  <dig> and  <dig>  could not be identified. the copper levels in all analysed samples were below  <dig> mg/kg, which is the recommended dietary copper concentration for sheep without addition of counteracting molybdenum  <cit> . copper intoxication has been reported in lambs housed in specific pathogen free  conditions and fed a diet with normal copper and molybdenum concentrations, which was attributed to the underdeveloped microflora in the rumen, particularly protozoa, which may inhibit copper absorption in the sheep by converting it in an insoluble form  or reducing the divalent copper ion to its less absorbable monovalent form  <cit> . although sheep in the present study were not reared spf, the accommodation was thoroughly cleaned and decontaminated with sodium hypochlorite before sheep were housed, and lambs were removed from their dams at birth, thus preventing transfer of protozoa via the dam. in addition, lambs were kept in groups of two for a considerably longer time in studies  <dig> and  <dig> where copper intoxication occurred, thus reducing contact with individuals and limiting the contamination of drinking water, which may act as the main source of protozoal transmission  <cit> . examination of rumen contents of the culled sheep would have been required to test this hypothesis, which was not done.

CONCLUSIONS
colostrum and milk from scrapie-affected ewes can transmit scrapie and results in a high transmission rate in sheep with a vrq/vrq genotype. using pmca prpsc was detectable in milk samples from selected ewes, which substantiates this method as a putative tool to study scrapie transmission in vitro.
