BACKGROUND
plants of the genus ocimum belong to the family lamiaceae  and are widely distributed in the tropical, sub-tropical and warm temperate regions of the world  <cit> . these plants are known to produce essential oils comprising of a number of aromatic compounds and tulsi is rightly known as the “queen of herbs” for this reason. in india, these plants are mostly grown at homes for worship and as offerings in temples. among plants with medicinal value, those belonging to the genus ocimum are very important aromatic herbs or shrubs.

the genus ocimum is highly variable and possesses wide genetic diversity at intra and inter-species levels. nine species of ocimum viz., o. teniuflorum l., o. basilicum l., o. gratissimum l., o. kilimandscharicum, o. micranthum l., o. campechianum l., o. americanum l., o. minimum l., and o. citriodorum l., are found in india, three of which  are exotic  <cit> . it is difficult to distinguish all these species on the basis of leaf morphology alone . the metabolites  of genus ocimum have been reported to possess antioxidant and antifungal properties and to cure many diseases including bronchitis in ayurveda, an indian system of medicine  <cit> . plants produce specialized metabolites as part of their defense mechanisms and these metabolites have significant medicinal properties that cure several human diseases. they can be isolated from various parts of the plant, including leaves, flowers, roots, bark, seeds and stem  <cit> . pharmacological screening and the systematic study of the chemical constituents of plant metabolites provide a basis for developing new drugs. some of the important metabolites reported from ocimum species include linalool, linalyl, geraniol, citral, camphor, eugenol, methyleugenol, methyl chavicol, methyl cinnamate, thymol, safrol, taxol, urosolic acid etc.  <cit> . these metabolites are of immense value in the pharmaceutical, perfume and cosmetic industries. metabolites derived from ocimum species have been found to contain many medicinally relevant properties including anti-cancer, antioxidant, antifungal and anti-inflammatory virtues, and are also recommended for the treatment of malaria, bronchitis, diarrhea, dysentery, etc.  <cit> . essential oils produced as specialized metabolites found in leaves, seeds, flowers and roots of ocimum species are used in pharmaceutics and many systems of traditional indian medicine  <cit> . genome and transcriptome sequencing of medicinal plants serve as a robust tool for gene discovery and downstream biochemical pathway discovery of medicinally important metabolites  <cit> . recently, an abundance of transcripts for biosynthesis of terpenoids in o. sanctum and of phenylpropanoids in o. basilicum  <cit>  was reported during an attempt to compare transcriptomes of the two species of ocimum. despite its important role in traditional indian medicine and its impressive arsenal of bioactive compounds, our understanding of krishna tulsi biology is limited. in this paper, we present the draft genome sequence of the non-model plant o. tenuiflorum , along with transcriptomes of two subtypes, krishna and rama tulsi from leaf samples. we have identified a large set of genes involved in the production of specialized metabolites of medicinal interest such as apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid pathway, eugenol, and ursolic acid.fig.  <dig> plant and leaf morphology of five ocimum species prevalent in india viz., o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna, o. tenuiflorum subtype rama, o. gratissimum, o. sacharicum, o. kilmand. leaf morphologies are quite different for the five species



RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly of the non-model plant o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna
the paired-end  and mate-paired  dna libraries were generated for krishna tulsi subtype using illumina protocols. in total we obtained  <dig> million reads of pe and  <dig> million reads of mp data for krishna tulsi. low quality  sequence reads were trimmed  and reads with quality scores of less than q <dig> were removed. the good quality reads were used for de-novo genome assembly. median insert size of pe data was  <dig> , whereas median insert size of mp data was  <dig> . k-mer  <dig> was opted as the best assembly from the statistical analysis of different k-mers. we obtained a maximum scaffold length of  <dig>  kb  with an n <dig> length of  <dig>  kb. this assembly gives rise to a total of  <dig>  scaffolds including equal to or more than 100 bp. the current draft assembly of krishna tulsi genome is  <dig>  mb in length. the genomic content of krishna tulsi is  <dig>  pg/2c which is equivalent to  <dig>  mb  <cit> , but the estimated genome size by k-mer method is 612 mb and 61 % of the estimated genome size was assembled. the genome size reported in the literature  <cit> , may be of a different cultivar. this lower genome coverage may be due to limited sequencing data  or due to a high percentage of repeats . in terms of depth of sequencing, we sequenced 59× of the genome with paired-end  and mate-pair  libraries . ocimum species are characterized by the different basic chromosome numbers x =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  <cit> . in case of o. tenuiflorum individuals with 2n =  <dig>  2n =  <dig>  and 2n =  <dig> have been recorded and the chromosome number of o. tenuiflorum is observed to be 2n =  <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> genome assembly results of krishna tulsi

a comparative analysis of the assemblies generated using pe data alone and with both pe and mp data show that the size and quality of the genome assembled using pe data alone improved substantially with the inclusion of mp data .

validation of de novo genome assembly, annotation and repeat content of ocimum tenuiflorum subtype krishna genome
the de novo genome assembly was validated by mapping raw reads to the assembled genome. on an average, 74 % of reads were mapped back to the assembled genome. almost  <dig>  % of the rna-seq reads were mapped to the assembled genome. the completeness of de novo genome assembly and annotations were also checked with two other approaches i.e., by using cegma   <cit>  and deg   <cit>  . first, we searched for essential eukaryotic genes in the o. tenuiflorum assembly. this resulted in the mapping of  <dig>  % of complete core proteins  and more than 95 % including partial genes against our genome assembly . secondly, we searched for the predicted genes from the final assembly of essential genes recorded in the deg database. we observed that about 89 % of essential genes were included within the assembly. these genes were also validated using pfam domain annotation and were of comparable domain lengths as the classical members of that family . phylogenetic trees for highly conserved essential genes like glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , cytochrome p <dig>  and actin  from krishna tulsi and their respective homologues were analyzed and compared with other plant species. krishna tulsi genes were found to cluster with genes belonging to related species namely, solanum lycopersicum, cucumis sativus and even with distantly related arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that highly conserved genes, essential to plant growth and functioning, have been detected in o. tenuiflorum assemblies. these trends further support the quality of the genome assembly.

regarding the repeat content of the genome, we identified  <dig> repeat regions, with a gc content of  <dig>  %, adding to 160889218 bp , which constituted  <dig>  % of assembled genome which is 374806882 bp  long . long terminal repeats  are found in large numbers in plant genomes  and a similar trend is also found in the type of repeats identified in the tulsi genome.

genome annotation
we identified  <dig> putative gene models in the initial genome draft  of o. tenuiflorum genome. at least one gene was observed in each of the  <dig> scaffolds, with an average of three to four genes per scaffold. during the process of refined gene prediction,  <dig> gene models were observed to have expression evidence ). a total of  <dig> gene models have been identified by ab initio means  .table  <dig> genome annotation results of krishna tulsi

ab initio


all the gene predictions, with or without rna/protein evidences, were screened based on length . in case of sequential overlaps between different gene models, the gene models which are of longer length and with rna or protein evidence for a given region of scaffold were preferred over the ones without any evidence.

there are  <dig>  genes with at least one homologue in nrdb and  <dig>  genes which contain at least one pfam domain. in total,  <dig> unique pfam domains were identified for all the predicted genes in tulsi . a majority of domains identified were protein kinases or lrr-containing domains . further comparison of pfam results, with assembled plant genomes of similar size, reveals that the number of predicted gene models is in overall agreement in numbers as well as gene boundaries.

orthology of tulsi genes
the orthology relationships were deduced between krishna tulsi  and four other species viz. arabidopsis thaliana , mimulus guttatus , solanum lycopersicum  and oryza sativa  . we observe  <dig> clusters which contain a total of  <dig> gene products from the five plant species . m. guttatus and o. tenuiflorum share the same order , but belong to different families , which was evident from the presence of the highest number of common gene families  between them. this was followed by solanum lycopersicum , arabidopsis thaliana  and oryza sativa  as expected from taxonomic hierarchy . we found  <dig> genes to be orthologous to any of the above four species. considering all the  <dig> ote genes,  <dig> groups contained only ote krishna tulsi genes . we obtained  <dig> ote genes which lack traceable orthology to  <dig> other plant species and homology relationships . few of these unique ote genes are transposons.fig.  <dig> distribution and clustering of orthologous genes of tulsi genome to other related plant genomes. a. distribution of gene families among five plant genomes. ocimum tenuiflorum , arabidopsis thaliana , oryza sativa , solanum lycopersicum  and mimulus guttatus . the numbers in the venn diagram represent shared and unique gene families across these  <dig> species obtained by orthomcl. b. horizontal stacked bar plot of all the genes in  <dig> different genomes. this figure shows ortholog group distribution in all  <dig> plant species including tulsi. each row represents a plant species - physcomitrella patens , selaginella moellendorffii , oryza sativa , setaria italic , zea mays , sorghum bicolor , aquilegia caerulea , ocimum tenuiflorum , mimulus guttatus , solanum lycopersicum , solanum tuberosum , vitis vinifera , eucalyptus grandis , citrus sinensis , theobroma cacao , carica papaya , brassica rapa , arabidopsis thaliana , fragaria vesca , prunus persica , glycine max , medicago truncatula , populus trichocarpa . the bar graph represents ortholog protein groups for that species subdivided into  <dig> categories depending on the degree of sharing with the other  <dig> plant species e.g., category  <dig> represents the number of orthologous groups that have representatives from the species of interest and from one more species out of the  <dig> species selected for the study



in order to inspect in detail the distribution of the orthologous relationship of ocimum genes across different species and taxonomic levels,  <dig> fully-sequenced plant genomes  were considered. the orthologous groups from all  <dig> species were organized according to the clustering. three hundred and thirty four clusters of genes are present across all the  <dig> species chosen for the study. common genes across all species, comprising of their respective orthologous group, are plotted as a horizontal stacked bar plot . the pattern of sharing orthologous groups is quite unique to primitive plant genomes  and monocots. however, the pattern observed in the tulsi genome is quite similar to that of m. guttatus . interestingly, this pattern is somewhat different for two members of solanacea, which have more genes shared only in two out of  <dig> genomes, perhaps due to other features such as polyploidy.

genes involved in synthesis of specialized metabolites of medicinal value: comparative analysis between o. tenuiflorum  and other plant genomes
next, we performed a restricted analysis of the genes involved in the metabolite production in ote and the genomes of a few plant species that are either closely-related  or well-characterised . we observed  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  scaffolds and contigs from the selected four representative genomes associated with  <dig> metabolite-related scaffolds and contigs in ote krishna tulsi  respectively. in terms of the number of orthologous genes from this selected plant genome associated with metabolite genes of ote, we observed a similar trend of association as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in s. lycopersicum, v. vinifera, m. truncatula, and a. thaliana respectively. these numbers agree with the taxonomic phylogeny and hierarchy, suggesting that the evolution of genes involved in metabolic pathways is not a cause of recent expansions or sudden drifts.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic representation of five selected plant genomes viz., solanum lycopercicum , vitis vinifera , medicago trucatula , and arabidopsis thaliana . the numbers indicate percentage of association of these genomes with the metabolite genes of ocimum genome. these percentages agree with the taxonomic phylogeny and hierarchy, suggesting that the evolution of genes involved in metabolic pathways is not a cause of recent expansions or sudden genome drifts. the inner circle represents chromosomes from respective homolog genome. each scaffold is organized in the middle circle and is represented in chronological order as per position on chromosomes. the line represents location of each scaffold on the respective chromosome. colors indicate  = <  <dig> genes,  = <dig> genes,  = >  <dig> genes,  = metabolite related genes. height of orange columns in outermost circle represents amount of repeats in corresponding scaffolds



when compared against  <dig>  scaffolds  from ote,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds were found to be associated with the four reference plant genomes . further, most of the metabolite-related scaffolds in ote krishna tulsi were associated with chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of tomato . in particular, gene products that are likely associated in luteolin synthesis pathway are observed to cluster in scaffolds, which are similar to nucleotide stretches in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the tomato genome .fig.  <dig> circular representation of o.tenuiflorum metabolite related genes mapped onto chromosomes of solanum lycopersicum genome. height of orange column  in outer circle represents amount of repeats present in respective scaffold. the inner circle represents chromosomes from tomato genome. inner circle of rectangles represents scaffolds, each scaffold is organized in the middle circle and is represented in chronological order as per position on chromosomes. color of each scaffold indicates following information:  = <dig> genes,  = >  <dig> genes,  = metabolite related genes. connecting line between scaffolds and chromosome represents postion of the scaffold in genome. red color of connecting line represents presence of metabolite related genes. scaffold numbers are mentioned in additional file 24: text a



transcriptome de novo assembly of krishna and rama tulsi mature leaf samples
de novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the mature leaf samples of subtype krishna tulsi. the best assembly resulted in  <dig> contigs with n <dig> of 893 bp and longest sequence of  <dig>  kb. all these contigs added up to  <dig>  mb with a gc content of  <dig>  %. scaffolding of these contigs resulted in  <dig> scaffolds with n <dig> of 1597 bp and longest sequence of  <dig>  kb. all these scaffolds added up to  <dig>  mb with a gc content of  <dig>  % . similarly, assembly was performed for the subtype rama tulsi and combined reads  as well .table  <dig> transcriptome assembly of ocimum tenuiflorum subtype krishna, rama and combined data

differential expression of transcripts
the differentially expressed genes found in the transcriptomes of both the tulsi subtypes were analysed. we observe a substantial number of genes up-regulated and down-regulated in krishna tulsi, compared to rama tulsi. some of the highly expressed genes were also confirmed by q-rt-pcr technique in different tissue samples i.e., stems, leaves and flowers and also in five species viz. o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna and rama, o. gratissimum, o. basilicum, and o. kilmand.

for a comparison, we generated a heat map of the top  <dig> differentially more abundant genes in krishna tulsi samples . similarly, top  <dig> differentially more abundant genes in rama with respect to krishna sample were also plotted . gamma-cadinene synthase is one of the top  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts with rpkm values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in krishna and rama tulsi samples, respectively . other highly expressed transcripts in krishna tulsi sample are heat shock cognate protein  <dig>  cellulose synthase a catalyic subunit  <dig> , fructose-biphosphate aldolase , phototropin- <dig>  and rubisco activase  <dig> . the chalcone synthase or naringenin-chalcone synthase  is one of the enzymes important for coloration of plant parts, which is observed to be highly expressed. abundance values of all the transcripts, along with their functional annotations by ncbi blast results and their corresponding krishna tulsi genomic scaffold, show several genes involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites implicated to be of medicinal value .fig.  <dig> transcript expression of tulsi krishna and rama subtypes are expressed as rpkm values. highly significant differentially abundant rna scaffolds/transcripts were defined to have rpkm of atleast  <dig> in both and the fold-change difference between two subtypes should be atleast  <dig> times. only the transcripts, for which the 95 % lower-confidence-bound of more abundant subtype and 95 % upper-confidence-bound of less abundant subtype, and had at least  <dig> times difference, were retained. of these differentially abundant transcripts, top- <dig> in krishna and rama subtype were plotted in the form of heat-map. a. differentially more abundant transcripts in krishna. b. differentially more abundant transcripts in rama. 



dark purple coloration of the leaves and stem of subtype krishna tulsi is one of its characteristic phenotypes, which distinguishes it from other subtypes and species of genus ocimum. chalcone synthase  is an enzyme belonging to a family of polyketide synthases which catalyzes the initial step for flavonoid biosynthesis. flavonoids are important plant specific metabolites that perform various functions such as pigmentation, antifungal defense etc. reviewed protein sequence for chs from uniprot  database  <cit>  was employed to search against annotated protein sequences of krishna tulsi genome and six transcripts were obtained as possible hits. the best hit could be identified with 95 % query coverage and 99 % sequence identity. the extent of abundance of this hit  was checked in the leaf transcriptome of both the tulsi subtypes viz. krishna and rama. abundance  of the six transcripts was, on an average, two times more in case of krishna as compared to rama , and may be involved in the coloration phenotype of krishna subtype plants  <cit> . for further confirmation of expression of these transcripts, q-rt-pcr was performed. as expected, anthocyanin producing gene was observed to be more abundant in krishna young leaf samples and mature leaf samples  . in contrast, the chlorophyll binding protein was more abundant in krishna mature leaf samples. in addition, we also examined the presence of gamma-cadeninene synthase gene which is responsible for aroma  <cit> . this gene was found to be more abundant in rama root sample and young leaf samples of o. saccharum, but not observed in higher quantities in o. kilmund.fig.  <dig> expression quantification of selected genes by q-rt-pcr method. a. fold changes of genes involved in color production, obtained through q-rt pcr. blue colour horizontal bar is for chlorophyll a-b binding protein, red to denote gamma-cadenine synthase and green to denote anthocyanin. mature leaf of krishna subtype was used as control. it can be seen that, genes responsible for color production such as chlorophyll a-b binding protein and gene in anthacyanin pathway are down-regulated as compared to mature krishna leaf, which corresponds to phenotypic characteristics. b. fold changes of genes involved in ursolic acid biosynthetic pathway, as obtained through qrt-pcr for  <dig> different tulsi subtypes. blue colour horizontal bar is for squalene epoxidase, red to denote alpha-amyrin synthase and green to denote cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase. mature leaf of krishna subtype was used as control. mature leaf of rama subtype has high expression of genes while expression in ocimum kilmund is low. expression of these genes are uniformly high in small, developing plants. samples are as follows: 1) o. tenuiflorum  - sampling leaf. 2) o. tenuiflorum  - sampling root. 3) o. tenuiflorum  - mature leaf. 4) o. tenuiflorum  - sampling leaf. 5) o. tenuiflorum  - sampling root. 6) o. gratissimum - sampling leaf. 7) o. gratissimum - sampling root. 8) o. gratissimum - mature leaf. 9) o. sacharicum - sampling leaf. 10) o. sacharicum - sampling root. 11) o. sacharicum - mature leaf. 12) o. kilmund - sampling leaf. 13) o. kilmund - sampling root. 14) o. kilmund - mature leaf



specialized metabolites detection and validation
nearly  <dig> specialized metabolites  are reported form the genus ocimum which are found to have medicinal values or properties  <cit> . amongst these,  <dig> metabolites belonging to five basic groups were found to have complete pathway information in plantcyc database   <cit>  . hence, genes involved in these pathways were chosen for further analysis and searched against the assembled genome of o. tenuiflorum. figure 7b highlights the distribution of the genes identified in various classes of metabolites of disease relevance .fig.  <dig> number of genes involved in specialized metabolite synthesis in tulsi genome. a. there are four classes of metabolites present in ocimum genome viz., sesquiterpenes , flavonoids , terpenes  and phenylpropanoids . number in the bracket is percentage of sepecialized metabolites present in the genome.  <dig> genes were identified as coding for enzymes involved in synthesis of specialized metabolites. b. specialized metabolic pathways of disease relevance proposed in ocimum tenuiflorum. major classes of diseases investigated are indicated in different colors: anticancer , anticancer-antioxidant , antifungal , antiseptic , anti-infective , antioxidant , and anti-inflammatory . the enzymes have been labelled with 5– <dig> letters for convenience. the numbers after the’_’ in the enzyme label represent the number of putative hits found for the given enzyme in the genomic assembly of o. tenuiflorum. the metabolites involved in the disease relevance and the enzymes involved in the synthesis of these metabolites are as follows: apigenin , luteolin , taxol , oleanolic acid , sitosterol , rosmarinic acid i , romarinic acid ii , methyl cahvicol , eugenol , linalool , caryophylene , selinene , citral 



a total of  <dig> genes were identified in ote genome, which are either homologous or directly code for enzymes involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites  . twenty eight o. tenuiflorum gene products were annotated as putative terpene synthases using blast sequence searches with e-value of 10− <dig> and query coverage filter of >75 % .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of terpene synthases of representative sequences of six classes from the plant kingdom along with putative tulsi terpene synthases genes: the tree is color coded as tpsa:red, tbsb:blue, tpsc:yellow, tpsd: green, tpse: blue and tpsf:purple


-refers to cases where there was no significant transcript evidence



among these specialized metabolites, we focused on ursolic acid, belonging to sesquiterpenes, since it is known to have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-tumour and anti-cancer properties. the synthesis of ursolic acid from squalene is a three-step process starting from squalene . α-amyrin is formed by concerted cyclization of squalene epoxide, while ursolic acid is eventually synthesized by the catalytic activity of multifunctional cytochrome p <dig>  the enzymes involved are, therefore, squalene epoxidase, alpha-amyrin synthase and alpha-amyrin  <dig>   <dig> monoxygenase. sequence search algorithms were employed to search for the three enzymes of this pathway in the tulsi genome, starting from protein sequences for each of these enzymes from plantcyc database as queries. the search for squalene epoxidase in tulsi, using the sequence of this enzyme in oryza sativa japonica  as a query, gave rise to a hit , with 50 % sequence identity covering 80 % of the query length . using amyrin synthase lup <dig> from a. thaliana  and  <dig> other well-accepted alpha/beta amyrin synthases as a query, four hits were identified in the tulsi genome . in classical amyrin synthases, a qw structural motif repeats six times in the entire sequence  <cit> , while there are two functional motifs, viz., a well conserved sdtae  <cit>  motif which is believed to form the catalytic pocket and the mwcycr  <cit>  motif that is shown to play a crucial role in catalysis. these motifs are observed in the four hits in tulsi genome . further, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using  <dig> query sequences and these four hits . one of the tulsi hits,  clusters with a well-characterized alpha amyrin synthase from c. roseus  suggesting that this particular scaffold might indeed retain an alpha amyrin synthase.fig.  <dig> the synthesis of ursolic acid from squalene is a three-step process starting from squalene. a: squalene epoxidase, b: α-amyrin synthase, c1: α-amyrin 28-monooxygenase , c2: uvaol dehydrogenase  and c3: ursolic aldehyde 28-monooxygenase. squalene epoxidase and alpha amyrin synthase, along with alpha amyrin  <dig> mono-oxygenase, uvol dehydrogenase and ursolic aldehyde  <dig> mono-oxygenase, play important role in synthesis of ursolic acid. these three genes have been chosen for quantification of gene expression by q-rt pcr method in different tissues and species

fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of sixteen amyrin query sequences and four putative amyrins from tulsi. tulsi hits are marked in blue clour, red ones are alpha amyrin synthase, greens are beta amyrin synthase and cyan ones are proteins from other class of amyrin. the presence of motifs and position in the phylogeny indicate that the hits obtained in o. tenuiflorum genome are likely to be alpha-amyrin synthases



interestingly, many genes involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites of relevance in the treatment of diseases are also more abundant, as observed in the assembled transcriptome . similarly, genes involved in the synthesis of  <dig> other specialized metabolites , are also equally interesting. however, this requires detailed understanding of the mechanism of synthesis and enzymes involved in the pathways. we analysed rna-seq data of two leaf samples in order to compare the genes related to important metabolite pathways and the peculiar phenotype of o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna with subtype rama tulsi. there were  <dig> transcripts, whose fold change in expression was observed to be eight times more in krishna tulsi than in rama tulsi. likewise, there were  <dig> transcripts whose fold change expression was eight times more in rama tulsi as compared to krishna tulsi. these are available for download at- .

in the case of the multifunctional cytochome p <dig> , a predicted gene from scaffold <dig> was obtained as a hit, when a reviewed uniprot entry f1t <dig> from v. vinifera was considered as query and searched in the tulsi genome assembly using blast. this hit retains 61 % sequence identity and the alignment covers 90 % of the length of the query . this scaffold contains a total of three predicted genes viz., ote <dig>  ote <dig>  and ote <dig> .

from the available transcriptome assembly, these genes, identified as involved in the synthesis of urosolic acid, were analysed for their levels of expression. the rpkm values were also high for these three genes . to further validate the levels of expression of these genes, q-rt-pcr was performed using sequence-specific primers. the presence of these three enzymes is generally high in all the mature leaf samples and highest in rama subtype . alpha-amyrin synthase is more abundant in mature leaf samples of o. gratissimum and o. sacharicum species. however, interestingly, the three enzymes are found to be more abundant in the young leaf samples of rama subtype; in contrast, atleast one of the three genes is less in the krishna leaf sample and in all root samples. the expression of the three genes implicated in urosolic acid synthesis is uniformly low in samples of o. kilmund.

next, to correlate gene expression and to quantify the presence of ursolic acid and eugenol, chemical profiling was performed using lc-mass spectrometry from different tissues and samples. eugenol and ursolic acid were observed in the highest quantities in mature leaf sample of rama subtype and in relatively low quantities in o. kilmund. the amount of eugenol in the leaf sample of o. tenuiflorum subtype rama  is considerably high followed by o. kilmund , o. sacharicum  and lowest in o. gratissimum . in all stem samples, the amount of eugenol is consistently low with the highest in o. tenuiflorum subtype rama , o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna , o. kilmund  and below limits of quantification in o. gratissimum and o. sacharicum. the presence of oleanolic acid is also severely reduced in stem samples of rama subtype  and in krishna subtype  in comparison to the mature leaf samples . the presence of urosolic acid is 50 % less in stem samples of rama subtype  when compared to the mature leaf samples , whereas it is much lower in the stem samples of other species as compared to the leaf sample. the amount of ursolic acid in the stem samples of krishna subtype  is  <dig>  times less than that of the mature leaf samples  .table  <dig> estimation results of eugenol and ursolic acid in different samples

discussion
o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna tulsi is one of the non-model plants of great medicinal value, for which there has been no genomic information available till date. we have performed genome sequencing of o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna of the paired-end  and mate-paired  dna libraries by illumina hiseq  <dig>  the best de novo assembly was obtained at k-mer  <dig> by soapdenovo <dig>  an eukaryotic de novo genome assembler. repeats were identified and masked, and gene prediction and annotation was carried out using the maker annotation pipeline by using genomic, transcriptomics and est data. the nearest species whose genome has been sequenced is the monkey flower , which shares its order lamiales with o. tenuiflorum  but falls in a different family . orthology search of ote krishna tulsi genes in four genomes viz. a. thaliana , m. guttatus , s. lycopersicum  and o. sativa  also confirmed the close relationship between krishna tulsi and m. guttatus , in terms of the number of common gene families i.e.,  <dig> out of  <dig> total genes. when we considered all the  <dig>  predicted genes from the krishna tulsi genome, we found that  <dig> ortholog groups have ocimum-only genes. these  <dig> groups contain  <dig>  ocimum genes and hence they are referred to as paralogs by orthomcl. of the remaining ote genes,  <dig>  genes were found to be orthologous to any of the other four species studied in this case. we performed an analysis of the genes involved in the metabolite production in ote and the genomes of a few other related plant species. based on the direct evidence or homology a total of  <dig> genes were identified in ote genome, which are involved in coding of enzymes implied in the synthesis of specialized metabolites. comparative analysis of transciptomes of o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna and rama was performed to detect potential differentially-regulated genes and their involvement in metabolite synthesis. on comparing both the transcriptomes, differentially expressed genes were observed with a substantial number of genes more abundant and others less abundant in either subtypes. gamma-cadinene synthase is more abundant in krishna sample  as compared to rama sample . to confirm some of the more abundant genes along with gamma-cadinene synthase, we performed q-rt-pcr in different tissue samples i.e., stem and leaves and also in five species viz. o. tenuiflorum subtype krishna and rama, o. gratissimum, o. basilicum, and o. kilmand. expression of gamma-cadinene synthase is found more in krishna samples as compared to rama by q-rt-pcr also. likewise, chalcone synthase  is an anthocyanin-producing gene, which is observed to be more abundant in young leaf samples of krishna and mature leaf samples in transcriptome data. subsequently, this has been confirmed by q-rt-pcr and from mass spectrometry readings of ursolic acid and eugenol from different tissue samples and from different species.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a draft genome of o. tenuiflorum krishna tulsi subtype krishna tulsi. the habitat of genus ocimum is tropical climate and it is wide spread over asia, africa, central and south america. high rna-seq expression values of the genes responsible for the purple coloration of the plant parts in krishna subtype, as compared to rama subtype, were observed. we also identified a ffew unique genes  of ote, which lack any traceable orthology and homology relationships from all the  <dig> species used in this study.

krishna tulsi is described in the vedas and puranas  and has a long history of cultivation, of roughly 3000 years, and is therefore assumed to be of indian origin  <cit> . in literature, it is also referred to as the “queen of herbs”. major genes involved in the synthesis of medicinally important specialized metabolites in the plant could be unraveled despite limited data on sequencing and coverage  <cit> . expressions of these genes were confirmed by complementing with rna-seq data and q-rt-pcr method. we also investigated one of the important metabolic pathways involving the production of ursolic acid in detail, by mass-spectrometry and q-rt-pcr methods. synthesis of specialized metabolites or their precursors appear to begin in the young leaves of tulsi. subsequently, the mature leaves retain the medicinally relevant metabolites. o. tenuiflorum rama subtype retains the high abundance of key medicinally relevant metabolites like eugenol and ursolic acid, as observed in the transcriptome, metabolite quantifications and q-rt-pcr expression values consistent with its high medicinal values. our main emphasis was to unravel the important metabolite genes by using genomic and transcriptomic data despite limited sequencing information.
