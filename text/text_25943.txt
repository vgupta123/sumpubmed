BACKGROUND
rheumatoid arthritis  is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by abnormal immune responses which lead to persistent synovitis and ultimately progressive destruction of cartilage and bone in multiple joints. among great progress in underlying the pathogenesis of ra, overexpression of inflammatory cytokines recruited by activated synovial fibroblasts is thought to play an important role in synovial hyperplasia and joint destruction  <cit> . interleukin- <dig> , a pleiotropic cytokine, contributes to the regulation of the immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis  <cit> . disruption of il- <dig> regulation has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , including promoting leukocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation  <cit> , helping naive t cell differentiation to t helper  <dig> cells  <cit> , stimulating osteoclast maturation and activation via receptor activator of nuclear factor-Κb ligand   <cit> , promoting angiogenesis by increasing production of vascular endothelial growth factor   <cit> . these findings suggest that targeting il- <dig> can be used as a therapeutic strategy and is a promising alternative in the treatment of ra.

tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody  that specifically targets both soluble interleukin- <dig> receptor  and membrane bound interleukin- <dig> receptor  with a high affinity, thereby preventing pro-inflammatory effects of il- <dig>  <cit> . to present, the application of tocilizumab is licensed for the treatment of ra  <cit> , systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis   <cit>  and castleman’s disease  <cit>  and represents a favorable efficacy in these diseases. however, therapeutic antibodies still have practical limitations. for instance, obstacles in production, high dose in application lead to a relatively high price and persist blocking activity needs repeatedly administration.

active immunization using epitope peptides to initiate the ongoing production of the desired antibody type would be an attractive alternative. however, due to immune tolerance, the use of a natural epitope peptide alone is inefficient in inducing efficient immune response  <cit> . mimotopes are small peptides that structurally mimic a given antibody-binding site but are composed of different amino acids  <cit> . active immunization using mimotopes would induce antibodies to recognize the mimicked epitope. notably, mimotopes can be isolated from phage display peptide libraries  <cit> . in current study, to make a substitution of tocilizumab, we screened and identified four peptides that can mimic the natural epitope of tocilizumab by using the phage display technology.

RESULTS
biopanning and mimotopes characterization
as tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes sil-6r and mil-6r, it was used as the target protein to screen peptides that can mimic the epitope. the eluted phage titrations increased with each round of panning, indicating that the phage particles might carry epitope mimics. the phage titrations were  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml ,  <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml , respectively, suggesting the phage bounding to tocilizumab was well enriched .fig.  <dig> four phage mimics were isolated and specifically recognized by tocilizumab. four rounds of biopanning were performed to identify the phage mimics. a the phage titer increased from  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml  to  <dig>  ×  <dig>  finally to  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml . b specificity elisa was then performed to observe whether the whole fourth amplified phage could be specifically recognized by the tocilizumab. the results showed the whole fourth amplified phage could be well recognized by both tocilizumab and isotype control. then  <dig> phage clones was selected and sequenced, and  <dig> different insert sequences were observed. then we performed experiments to observe whether the seven different peptides displayed could be specifically recognized by the tocilizumab. the results showed that four mimotope candidates were specifically recognized by tocilizumab but not by the isotype-matched control antibody when  <dig> pfu  or  <dig> pfu  of the isolated phage particles were used 



elisa was then performed to decide whether the amplified phages could be specifically recognized by tocilizumab. the results showed the amplified phages from  <dig> rounds of screening could be well recognized by both tocilizumab and isotype controls, but no significant difference was observed .

genomic dnas from  <dig> phage clones were selected and sequenced, and seven different insert sequences were obtained. then we performed experiments to observe whether the seven different peptides displayed could be specifically recognized by tocilizumab. when about  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu of the isolated phages were used, the four mimotope candidates were specifically recognized by tocilizumab but not by the isotype-matched controls . to decide which candidate exhibited better specificity, we reduced the input from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  × 107pfu. our results demonstrated that the phage clones 4a <dig> and 4a <dig> showed a better specificity, as compared to the other two .

to demonstrate mimicry between the peptides and the original antigen, three independent phage competitive binding assay were then performed. in set one,  <dig>  m glycine–hcl , ril-6r and an irrelevant peptide were used to compete with the binding of phage particles to tocilizumab. the bound phage particles were detected by titer determination. recombinant il-6r could displace a large amount of bound phage from the tocilizumab, i.e., the phage mimic 4a <dig> bound to tocilizumab were displaced, about  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using  <dig>  m glycine–hcl ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using ril-6r, only  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using the irrelevant peptide, respectively. the phage mimic 4a <dig> bound to tocilizumab were displaced, about  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using  <dig>  m glycine–hcl ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using ril-6r, only  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using the irrelevant peptide, respectively. the phage mimic 4a <dig> bound to tocilizumab were displaced, about  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using  <dig>  m glycine–hcl ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu using ril-6r, only  <dig>  ×  <dig> using the irrelevant peptide, respectively. the phage mimic 4a <dig> bound to tocilizumab were displaced, about  <dig>  ×  <dig> using  <dig>  m glycine–hcl ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> using ril-6r, only  <dig>  ×  <dig> using the irrelevant peptide, respectively .fig.  <dig> isolated phage clones can mimic the original antigen. to demonstrate mimicry between the peptides and the original antigen, three independently phage competitive binding assay were then performed. a in set one, ril-6r could displace a large amount of bound phage from the tocilizumab by using titration. b in set two, the phage binding rate of all phage mimics decreased significantly after we added ril-6r to compete with the binding of phage particles to tocilizumab by using elisa. c in set three, the phage competitive rate of all phage mimics increased significantly after we added phage particles to compete with the binding of tocilizumab to ril-6r using elisa 



in set two, the phage binding rate of all phage mimics decreased significantly after we added ril-6r to compete with the binding of phage particles to tocilizumab. the binding rate decreased to  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , respectively. the percentage of binding rate was calculated using the following formula: phagebindingrate%=api−abap−ab×100%, where ab is the background absorbance , ap is the phage absorbance  and api is the absorbance of the competitive absorbance . the assay was performed in duplicate .

in set three, the phage competitive rate of all phage mimics increased significantly after we added phage particles to compete with the binding of tocilizumab to ril-6r. the phage competitive rate of phage mimic 4a <dig> is  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  9 % , respectively. the phage competitive rate of phage mimic 4a <dig> is  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % , respectively. the phage competitive rate of phage mimic 4a <dig> is  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % , respectively. the phage competitive rate of phage mimic 4a <dig> is  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % , respectively. the percentage of competitive rate was calculated using the following formula: phageconpetitiverate%=atp−abat−ab×100%, where ab is the background absorbance , at is the tocilizumab absorbance  and atp is the absorbance of the competitive absorbance  . the assay was performed in duplicate.

immune responses induced by mimotopes vaccination
from the specificity elisa and the competitive binding assay results, the four reactive peptides  displayed by phage particles were chosen for chemical synthesis. the immunogenicity of the mimotope conjugates was then evaluated by immunizing balb/c mice. mice immunized with the mimotope conjugates successfully developed antibodies against ril-6r  and sil-6r  and/or mil-6r  expressed in hela, u- <dig> and jurkat cells . antibody competitive assays showed that tocilizumab could compete with antibodies induced by 4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate for il-6r. however, we noticed that more antibodies induced by 4a124-klh conjugate bound to sil-6r when incubated with tocilizumab . results of fluorescent immunostaining revealed that mimotopes induced mouse antibodies could recognize il-6r in hela, u- <dig> and jurkat cell line, as compared to the control groups .fig.  <dig> mimotope-induced antibodies for il-6r recognition. a titers of the six mouse groups determined by elisa  against ril-6r. b hela, jurkat and u- <dig> cell lysates were loaded with 50 μg/per lane. il-6r expressed in hela, jurkat and u- <dig> detection using tocilizumab  and the sera from mice immunized with the 4a220-klh conjugate , the 4a124-klh conjugate , 4a125-klh conjugate , 4a126-klh conjugate , the control peptide-klh conjugate , or the carrier klh alone . sera were diluted with 1: <dig>  the results showed that the antibodies in the sera of the mice immunized with mimotopes could recognize sil-6r  and/or mil-6r  expressed in hela, jurkat and u- <dig> cell line. c for antibody competitive assays, hela cell lysates were loaded with 40 μg/per lane. il-6r expressed in hela was detected by using sera from mice immunized with the 4a220-klh conjugate , tocilizumab+ sera from mice immunized with the 4a220-klh conjugate , sera from mice immunized with the 4a124-klh conjugate , tocilizumab+ sera from mice immunized with the 4a124-klh conjugate , sera from mice immunized with the 4a125-klh conjugate , tocilizumab+ sera from mice immunized with the 4a125-klh conjugate , sera from mice immunized with the 4a126-klh conjugate  and tocilizumab+ sera from mice immunized with the 4a220-klh conjugate . sera were diluted with 1: <dig>  the results showed that antibodies induced by mimotopes-klh conjugate could compete with tocilizumab to il-6r expressed in hela cells, except antibodies induced by 4a124-klh conjugate

signaling pathway analysis
we next addressed the question whether il- <dig> pathway could be down-regulated by adding sera from mice immunized with tocilizumab mimotopes. in hela cells, incubation with sera from mice immunized with 4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate could reduce the level of phosphorylated- stat <dig> and phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig>  as compared to the control group. in jurkat cells, incubation with sera from mice immunized with 4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate could reduce the level of stat <dig>  phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  in u <dig> cells, incubation with sera from mice immunized with 4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate could increase the level of phosphorylated- stat <dig>  stat <dig> and phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig> .fig.  <dig> signaling pathway analysis with mimotope-induced antibodies. we detected the levels of phosphorylated-stat <dig>  stat <dig>  phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig> and erk1/ <dig> in hela, jurkat and u <dig> cells to observe whether il- <dig> pathway could be down-regulated by when added sera from mice immunized with mimotopes. cells were grown at 37 °c with medium containing 10 % fbs. two days later, the medium was replaced by fbs-free medium with sera from mimotopes immunized mice with a dilution 1: <dig> or tocilizumab  at 37 °c for 2 h. then the cells were incubated with human il- <dig>  for 15 min at 37 °c. in hela cells , incubation with sera from mice immunized with 4a <dig> and 4a <dig> could partly reduce the levels of phosphorylated-stat <dig> and phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig>  as compared to the control group. in jurkat cells , incubation with sera from mice immunized with 4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate could reduce the level of stat <dig>  phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  in u <dig> cells , incubation with sera from mice immunized with 4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate could increase the level of phosphorylated- stat <dig>  stat <dig> and phosphorylated-erk1/2



adcc induced by antibodies against mimotopes
to assess whether the antibodies induced by the mimotopes can exhibit specific lysis of the target cells, we performed adcc assay. the percentage of cellular cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula: %cytotoxicity=1−ae−abau−ab×100%. 

the results showed that the antibodies induced by 4a <dig>  4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate elicited specific lysis of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of hela cells, while the antibodies induced by 4a <dig>  4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate elicited specific lysis of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of u <dig> cells. in jurkat cells, the antibodies induced by 4a <dig>  4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a <dig> elicited specific lysis of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> adcc against hela, u <dig> and jurkat cells elicited by mimotope-induced antibodies. to assess whether the antibodies induced by the mimotope conjugates can exhibit specific lysis of the target cells, we performed the adcc assay. the fourth pooled immune sera of the mimotope-immunized mice or the control mice were diluted 1: <dig> and used in adcc assays. lymphocytes of the naive balb/c mice were prepared as effector cells. the effector to target  cell ratio was about 100: <dig>  the results showed that the antibodies induced by 4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate could elicite specific lysis of hela and u <dig> cells. however, no specific lysis was observed in jurkat cells 



antibodies induced by mimotopes binding to il-6r of fls-ra
then we detected whether the antibodies induced by mimotopes could bind to the fls-ra cell lysates. the results of western bolt  and fluorescent immunostaining  showed that the antibodies in the sera of the mice immunized with mimotopes could recognize sil-6r  and/or mil-6r  expressed in fls-ra.fig.  <dig> western blot and immunofluorescence staining with mimotope-induced antibodies for il-6r recognition in fls-ra. a fibroblast-like synoviocytes lysates from three patients with ra were loaded with 40 μg/per lane. il-6r expressed in fls-ra detection using tocilizumab  and the sera from mice immunized with the 4a220-klh conjugate , the 4a124-klh conjugate , 4a125-klh conjugate , 4a126-klh conjugate , the control peptide-klh conjugate , or the carrier klh alone . sera were diluted with 1: <dig>  b represent image of il-6r recognition in fls-ra. fls-ra cells were incubated with tocilizumab and pooled serum followed by fitc-labeled secondary antibodies where the nuclei were stained with dapi.  sera from mice immunized with 4a220-klh,  sera from mice immunized with 4a124-klh,  sera from mice immunized with 4a125-klh,  sera from mice immunized with 4a126-klh,  tocilizumab,  sera from mice immunized with the control peptide-klh,  sera from mice immunized with klh alone. the results showed that the antibodies in the sera of the mice immunized with mimotopes could recognize il-6r expressed in fls-ra



discussion
one way to overcome the serious practical limitations of the monoclonal antibody approach could be to perform immunization with peptide mimics  of a naturally occurring epitope that is recognized by the desired antibody. to isolate mimotopes of tocilizumab, which has been considered as a promising agent for treating ra, the phage display was exploited in this study. after four rounds of biopanning, we isolated four peptide mimics that were specifically recognized by tocilizumab. il- <dig> is the prototypic gp130-cytokine and binds the gp <dig> receptor through three conserved epitopes , of which site iii is unique to gp130-cytokines. il- <dig> must first form a complex with a nonsignaling α receptor, il-6rα , through site i. phe <dig>  tyr <dig>  glu <dig> and phe <dig> from the d <dig> domain of site i contribute the majority to form the initial il-6/il-6rα binary complex  <cit> . we aligned the mimotope sequences and found that phage mimics 4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a <dig> bear these key amino acids , suggesting that not only tocilizumab but also the antibodies induced by these mimotopes may prevent il- <dig> binding to il-6rα through these key amino acids.

titer determination was performed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the isolated mimotopes. as small peptide molecules are not sufficient enough to stimulate the immune system and may even induce tolerance, we coupled the mimotopes to an immunogenic carrier, klh. mice immunized with 4a <dig>  4a <dig>  4a <dig> and 4a <dig> successfully developed high antibody titers against klh as well as the mimotopes. the induced sera also recognized ril-6r and il-6r expressed in hela, u- <dig> and jurkat cell line. western blots and immunofluorescence staining further supported that the antibodies induced by the four isolated mimotopes can bind to il-6r. notably, we found that more antibodies induced by 4a <dig> bound to sil-6r when incubated with tocilizumab. we assumed that the antibodies induced by 4a <dig> may bind both sil-6r and tocilizumab, so tocilizumab could act like “bridge” to help antibodies induced by 4a <dig> to bind sil-6r.

in signaling pathway analysis, we found that antibodies induced by mimotopes play different roles in different cell line. in hela and jurkat cells, antibodies induced by mimotopes may act as a neutralizing role, but in u <dig> cells, they may have an aggressive role. notably, when we added il- <dig> with sera from untreated or cp mice, the level of phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig> increased more than il- <dig> alone in hela cells. why the level of phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation increased more when adding il- <dig> with sera? we assumed that the most likely explanation was that some homologous cytokines might overlap human il- <dig> to activate signaling pathway in hela cells. in addition, we found that antibodies induced by 4a <dig> and 4a126-klh conjugate and tocilizumab could reduce the level of total stat <dig>  phosphorylated-erk1/ <dig> and total erk1/ <dig> in jurkat cells. the mechanism how anti-il-6r antibodies could reduce the level of total stat <dig> and erk1/ <dig> in jurkat cells needs further study.

in adcc assays, we found that anti-sera of all mimotopes could not induce adcc effect against jurkat cells. because jurkat cells are apt to form colony, we assumed that the effector cells could not contact to inner target cells and show significantly specific lysis to jurkat cells.

the antibodies induced by all the phage mimics show a similar capacity of binding the il-6r expressed in hela, u- <dig>  jurkat and fls-ra cells. we noticed that mimotope 4a <dig> may not bear any key amino acids, but the antibodies induced by 4a <dig> still recognized il-6r in these cell lines. we assumed that although mimotope 4a <dig> is composed of different amino acids, it may structurally mimic the tocilizumab-binding site.

our study demonstrated that active immunization induced by tocilizumab mimotopes in vivo can produce the desired antibody. with active immunization, the main obstacles of passive immunotherapy, specifically the comparatively short antibody half-life, may be overcome. immunological memory will be induced to provide ongoing protection for vaccinated individuals. meanwhile, the immunogenicity of artificial antibodies may be solved because the antibodies are produced by the patients themselves. to further evaluate the feasibility of mimotopes vaccination approach, the mimotopes of am16- <dig>  should be screened and used to immunize the collagen-induced arthritis  animal models for us to observe whether the mimotopes of am16- <dig> could raise antibodies against the murine il-6r and ameliorate the arthritis in animal models.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully isolated four mimotopes of tocilizumab and demonstrated that active immunization induced by these mimotopes can produce the desired antibody in vivo. mimotopes identified for il-6r may represent a novel alternative for treating ra or other autoimmune diseases.
