BACKGROUND
plants can detach aged leaves, unfertilized flowers, diseased or damaged organs and mature fruits or ripe seeds. these abscission processes enable plants to recycle nutrients for continuous growth, develop appropriate organs, survive diseases, and facilitate reproduction
 <cit> . abscission occurs at predetermined positions called abscission zones . the az contains a group of small cells that lack large vacuoles, suggesting that these cells may be arrested in an undifferentiated state
 <cit> . control of abscission has been an important agricultural concern because of its substantial effect on crop yield and quality. for example, humans have selected germplasms with reduced seed shattering during the domestication of grains such as rice , maize , and wheat 
 <cit> . also, in tomato , “jointless” cultivars with mutations inhibiting pedicel az development have been widely adopted for mechanical harvesting, because in the absence of an az, the stem and sepals remain on the plant, allowing the fruit to be harvested without the green tissues.

abscission can be divided into four major steps
 <cit> :  development of the az,  acquisition of competence to respond to abscission-promoting signaling,  activation of abscission, and  sealing of the break by differentiation of a protective layer on the main body side of the az. az development in tomato fruit/flower pedicels has been extensively investigated and several mutations that affect pedicel az development have been identified. for example, jointless  and jointless <dig>  mutations completely suppress az differentiation and the lateral suppressor  mutation partially impairs az development
 <cit> . the j and ls loci encode a mads-box transcription factor and a gras family transcription factor, respectively
 <cit> . the j <dig> locus remains to be identified but is predicted to encode a c-terminal domain  phosphatase-like protein
 <cit> . recently, we determined that the mads-box transcription factor macrocalyx , which was identified as a regulator of sepal size
 <cit> , also regulates tomato pedicel az development by interacting with the mads-box protein encoded by the j locus
 <cit> .

in other systems, investigation of genes involved in az structure development  identified several genes regulating the formation of the az. in arabidopsis, the mads-box transcription factor gene seedstick  and the bhlh transcription factor gene hecate <dig>  regulate the formation of seed azs
 <cit> , and blade-on-petiole <dig>  and bop <dig>  which encode btb/poz domain and ankyrin repeat containing npr1-like proteins, regulate formation of floral organ azs
 <cit> . in rice, pedicel az formation for seed shattering is regulated by qsh <dig>  which is a major chromosome  <dig> quantitative trait locus for seed shattering and encodes a bell-type homeobox transcription factor, and sh <dig>  which is a major chromosome  <dig> seed shattering quantitative trait locus and encodes a myb <dig> dna-binding domain containing protein. rice pedicel az formation is also regulated by shattering abortion <dig>  encoding an ap <dig> family transcription factor, the rice shattering <dig> homologue  encoding a yab family transcription factor, and ctd phosphatase-like protein <dig> 
 <cit> .

studies of steps  <dig> and  <dig>  activation of abscission and differentiation of the protective layer, have also revealed several factors required for abscission. for example, the phytohormones auxin and ethylene stimulate abscission-promoting signaling and regulate the onset of abscission in an antagonistic fashion; auxin inhibits the onset of abscission and ethylene promotes abscission
 <cit> . cell wall degrading and modifying enzymes are activated in the az separation layers
 <cit> . in addition, transcription factors, receptor-like kinases, signal peptides, chromatin remodeling factors and membrane-trafficking proteins are involved in the activation of abscission
 <cit> . furthermore, genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that a wide variety of genes for phytohormone signaling, cell wall degradation, and defense related proteins are up-regulated during abscission
 <cit> .

although many studies have examined the other steps of abscission, the mechanisms that drive step  <dig>  acquisition of competence to respond to abscission signals, have remained mysterious. prior to the onset of abscission, azs possess the ability to respond to abscission-initiating signaling but the az cells have not initiated abscission. for example, tomato pedicel azs at anthesis remain in an idling state before receiving abscission-promoting signals. once the signal is provided, the az cells immediately start abscission, but if the flower is successfully pollinated, then the az cells remain small, dividing as the az structure grows thicker to support the growing fruit. the cells in stage  <dig> are seemingly static and inactive, but we recently found that azs of tomato pedicels at anthesis show a distinct gene expression pattern; the anthesis pedicel azs specifically express blind , goblet , ls and a tomato wuschel homologue , and this expression is not present in the pedicels of az-lacking mutants
 <cit> . the function of these transcription factor genes in pedicel azs is still unknown, but these genes are well known to play crucial roles in shoot apical or axillary meristems
 <cit> . their az-specific expression suggests that these transcription factors may act at the pre-abscission step, possibly to prevent flower abscission or to establish competence to respond to abscission signaling.

to identify additional genes potentially involved in the abscission of tomato pedicels at anthesis, here we performed transcriptome analyses comparing the expression profiles in azs with two flanking pedicel regions, on the flower side  and on the inflorescence side . examination of the specific expression properties of these pedicel regions provided insights on the properties of each pedicel region and on cell activity in the pre-abscission state. in addition, we further characterized four previously identified transcription factors, examining the detailed expression patterns of lewus, bl, gob and ls at anthesis. our results indicated that these four genes showed significant expression changes when abscission was induced, suggesting that these genes play pivotal roles in the onset of abscission.

RESULTS
comparative transcriptome analysis revealed genes up-regulated in the az of tomato flower pedicels at anthesis
az cells of a tomato flower are recognized even at the early stage of flower primordium development; at the flower anthesis stage, six to eight layers of cells are observed in the az and the flower pedicels have acquired the competence to respond to abscission-promoting signals
 <cit> . to identify genes preferentially expressed in the az of tomato flower pedicels at anthesis, we used the agilent tomato 44k oligonucleotide dna microarray to perform transcriptome assays comparing azs and the non-az pedicel regions, dis and prox . microarray experiments were performed on three independently prepared samples and probes showing at least a 3-fold change  in signal intensity were selected. as a result, we found that  <dig> probes showed higher signal intensity in the az than in prox, and  <dig> probes were higher in the az than in dis . in total,  <dig> probes showed higher signal intensity in the az than in both prox and dis . of the est sequences for the  <dig> probes,  <dig> ests represented  <dig> international tomato annotation group -predicted genes, but the remaining  <dig> ests have not yet been assigned to any predicted genes . here we regarded the  <dig> predicted genes and  <dig> non-assigned ests as independent genes, and further examined the functions of these  <dig> genes. to verify the microarray assay results, we arbitrarily selected  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> genes and analyzed expression of the  <dig> genes by reverse transcription pcr  . the expression specificities within the three pedicel regions showed good consistency between the rt-pcr and the microarray results.

if more than two probes derived from the same gene were selected, only the result of the probe indicating the highest fold change value was shown in this table. each assay result is shown in additional file
 <dig> and
 <dig>  genes examined by rt-pcr are marked with lower case “a”.

based on the annotation of their arabidopsis homologues, we inferred the function of the  <dig> genes preferentially expressed in the az. from the putative functions of these  <dig> genes, we found  <dig> major functional groups: transcription factors , phytohormone metabolism, signaling and response , cell wall-degrading or modification , defense function , lipid metabolism  and transporter/channel proteins  .

we also identified genes for which expression in the az was lower than that in prox and dis. the genes showing az expression levels of less than one-third of that detected in both prox and dis  were selected. this group included only four ests, bf <dig>  ta41413_ <dig>  ak <dig>  and ak <dig> . ak <dig> encodes a homologue of a putative auxin-responsive protein, whereas the others showed no sequence similarity to any known genes. the result was insufficient to assess specific features of the az cells thus we did not analyze these four further.

transcription factor genes specifically up-regulated in the az
we previously reported that pedicel az cells at anthesis express the transcription factor genes bl, gob, ls and lewus, which have been identified as regulators of apical or axillary meristem development. in addition to these  <dig> genes, here we found  <dig> other transcription factor genes that were preferentially expressed in pedicel azs at anthesis . the  <dig> identified genes belong to  <dig> transcription factor families: a knox family gene , a bell family gene , a zinc finger-homeodomain  family gene , an ovate family gene ,  <dig> ethylene responsive transcription factor  family genes , an at-hook family gene  and a homeodomain-like superfamily gene  . ovate, slerf <dig> and ck <dig> are expressed in an mc and jointless dependent manner in tomato pedicels, similar to bl, gob, ls and lewus <cit> . previous studies showed that several transcription factor families described here play roles in organ abscission. for example, the knox family transcription factors, which were first identified to regulate shoot meristem identity
 <cit> , were also shown to be involved in abscission processes in floral organs
 <cit> . also, the bell family gene qsh <dig> regulates formation of the abscission zone in rice seed shattering
 <cit> . some of the transcription factor families found in azs are involved in phytohormone metabolism and signaling pathways. for example, the ck <dig> encoding protein showed sequence similarity to the arabidopsis zf-hd family gene homeobox protein <dig>  which functions in the abscisic acid  response pathway
 <cit> . the at-hook family controls inflorescence formation, senescence, and gibberellin  metabolism
 <cit> . members of the erf family were originally identified as regulators of ethylene signaling but are now known to respond to abiotic and biotic stresses and regulate lipid metabolism and development
 <cit> . the ovate family proteins have been identified as regulators of cell elongation, and tomato ovate regulates fruit shape
 <cit> .

phytohormone related genes specifically up-regulated in the az
because pedicel abscission at the pre-abscission stage is prevented by auxin, we expected that genes related to auxin activities would be expressed predominantly in the az. indeed, ak <dig> and ak <dig>  which are homologues of methylesterase <dig>  and dwarf in light <dig> / auxin-inducible gretchen hagen  <dig>  , respectively, showed higher transcript levels in the az than in prox and dis . mes <dig> is implicated in conversion of a storage form of indole-3-acetic acid  into the active form and dfl <dig> encodes an iaa amido synthetase, which produces a storage form of iaa from the active form
 <cit> . in addition, several genes involved in pathways related to diverse phytohormones showed higher expression in the az than in non-az tissues; these include genes involved in jasmonate  metabolism , brassinosteroid metabolism and biosynthesis  and ga signaling regulation .

cell wall degrading and remodeling genes specifically up-regulated in the az
our transcriptome analyses showed that several genes for cell wall degrading and remodeling factors were expressed at higher levels in the az than in the non-az tissues. these include genes for polygalacturonase , peroxidase and expansin. pg, an enzyme that hydrolyzes cell wall pectin, has been demonstrated to promote abscission in various plant organs
 <cit>  and pg genes are strongly up-regulated at the onset of abscission in tomato pedicels
 <cit>  and citrus  leaves
 <cit> . in tomato pedicels, pg expression is strictly limited to the az after initiation of abscission
 <cit> . expansin is a cell wall remodeling protein and reportedly regulates abscission of leaflets in elderberry  and pedicels in arabidopsis
 <cit> . gene expression or enzyme activity of peroxidases is detected during abscission in tobacco  flower pedicels and citrus leaves
 <cit> . although the expression of the genes for pg, expansin and peroxidase were expressed preferentially in azs, the expression levels of the genes at the pre-abscission stage was much lower than after the onset of abscission 
 <cit> . thus, these proteins may have different functions between pre-abscission and during abscission. during the pre-abscission stage, these genes may be involved in az tissue maintenance or thickening of the az by remodeling cell wall components. it is also possible that the pg activity at anthesis may be too low to have any significant effect on cells, because the expression level was much lower than that during the abscission activated stage .

defense-related and lipid metabolism genes specifically up-regulated in the az
several pathogenesis-related  genes are reportedly expressed at the site where organs will be shed during abscission
 <cit> . the pr genes are expected to function in defense to prevent potential pathogen infections during abscission
 <cit> . many pr genes are also expressed in unstressed tissues such as poplar leaves and tobacco flowers, possibly for development or basal defense activity against opportunistic pathogen invasion
 <cit> . our transcriptome analysis also revealed that homologues of defense-related genes encoding basic chitinases , pr <dig> , basic pr <dig> , osmotin proteins  and a major latex protein–like protein  were preferentially expressed in azs at anthesis.

lipids may act as an additional defense against pathogen infection or dehydration at abscission. an anatomical study revealed that the clefts in pedicel azs are filled with lipid compounds such as cutin
 <cit>  and our previous study showed that many lipid metabolism genes were down-regulated in the pedicels of non-az-forming plants  compared with wild-type plants
 <cit> . accordingly, we found that  <dig> homologues associated with lipid metabolism were preferentially expressed in the az; the genes encode a lipid binding protein , a gdsl-motif lipase/hydrolase , a fatty acid desaturase , a protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein , a glycine rich protein/oleosin , and a patatin-like protein  .

genes differentially expressed between prox and dis
previous investigations showed that, after the onset of abscission, the prox and dis tissues show distinct expression patterns for several abscission-related genes such as pg, β- <dig> -glucanase  and ribonuclease at anthesis
 <cit> . in this study, we analyzed expression pattern differences between the two tissues at the anthesis stage, or pre-abscission stage. by using fold-change >  <dig>  as a cutoff, we found that  <dig> probes showed higher signal intensity in prox than in dis  and  <dig> probes were higher in dis than in prox . subsequently, among these genes, we focused on transcription factors and phytohormone-related genes. by using more strict criteria, fold-change >  <dig> , as a cutoff, we identified  <dig> transcription factor genes and  <dig> phytohormone-related genes that were preferentially expressed in prox , and  <dig> transcription factor genes and  <dig> phytohormone-related genes that were preferentially expressed in dis . we also used rt-pcr to verify the results of the microarray analyses for  <dig> arbitrarily selected genes and found that the rt-pcr results were consistent with the microarray data .

if more than two probes derived from the same gene were selected, only the result of the probe indicating the highest fold change value was shown in this table. each assay result is shown in additional file
 <dig>  genes examined by rt-pcr are marked with lower case “a”.

 <dig>  genes examined by rt-pcr are marked with lower case “a”.

transcription factor genes differentially expressed between prox and dis
among the genes preferentially expressed in dis, we found five mads-box genes , which are homologous to agamous-like <dig> , sepalata <dig> , sepalata <dig>  or ap <dig>  the arabidopsis regulators of flower organ identity . an apetala <dig>  homologue  was also found among the genes preferentially expressed in dis. arabidopsis ap <dig> encodes a transcription factor belonging to the ap <dig> family and regulates flower organ identity
 <cit> ; the tomato homologue slap2a has been shown to be a negative regulator of ethylene biosynthesis during fruit ripening
 <cit> . recently, a rice ap <dig> homologue has been shown to regulate az development for seed shattering
 <cit> . by contrast, among the transcription factor genes preferentially expressed in prox, we found a homologue of arabidopsis suppressor of overexpression of constans  <dig> , which encodes a mads-box protein regulating floral meristem identity 
 <cit> .

several transcription factor genes implicated in auxin-regulated signaling pathways showed differential expression between prox and dis. for example, an auxin response factor  family gene  was preferentially expressed in prox. the genes preferentially expressed in dis include homologues that encode members of the auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  family , nac family , and myb family . arf family proteins are implicated as regulators of auxin signaling
 <cit>  and arabidopsis arf <dig>  and arf <dig> are redundantly required to promote floral organ abscission
 <cit> . ak <dig> encodes a homologue of arabidopsis iaa <dig>  which is involved in auxin-mediated elongation of hypocotyls
 <cit> . bg <dig> is a myb <dig> homologue that modulates auxin signaling
 <cit> . tc <dig> shows similarity to nac <dig>  which is involved in auxin-mediated lateral root formation
 <cit> .

a yab family gene  was preferentially expressed in prox and another yab homologue  was preferentially expressed in dis. yab family proteins act as regulators to establish abaxial cell fates during lateral organ development in arabidopsis
 <cit> . recently, a yab homologue gene sh <dig> and its homologue genes were identified to regulate seed shattering in cereal species, including sorghum, rice and maize
 <cit> .

phytohormone-related genes with distinct expression patterns between prox and dis
the genes expressed at higher levels in dis than in prox included several homologues of genes regulating phytohormone activities . for example, bw <dig> encodes a homologue of gh <dig> , which mediates auxin conjugation
 <cit> ; bp <dig> and ak <dig> encodes homologues of hookless <dig> , which serves as an integrator of ethylene, auxin, and light signaling pathways in differential cell elongation in arabidopsis hypocotyls
 <cit> . slaco <dig> encodes a 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase , which catalyzes ethylene biosynthesis and bg <dig> and ta49618_ <dig> are homologues of cytokinin oxidase <dig>  which encodes a cytokinin oxidase that degrades cytokinins. we also found two phytohormone-related genes that are expressed preferentially in prox, lipoxygenase a  and root system inducible <dig>  . loxa encodes a lipoxygenase of the 9-lox pathway and is proposed to function in biosynthesis of oxylipins
 <cit> . products of the 9-lox pathway share similar biological functions with jas in defense responses
 <cit> . rsi- <dig> is a member of the gasa  gene family, which includes regulators involved in cell and organ elongation
 <cit> ; rsi- <dig> has been identified as a regulator of lateral root development
 <cit> 

spatiotemporal expression of bl, gob, ls and lewus in response to an abscission signal
we previously showed that bl, gob, ls and lewus are preferentially expressed in anthesis pedicel azs under the regulation of mc and jointless. here we carried out a more detailed analysis of their expression patterns. first, we analyzed their expression during pedicel development from 5 days before anthesis to 3 weeks after anthesis by quantitative rt-pcr . a substantial amount of bl expression was detected from 5 days before anthesis and the expression reached its maximal level at 2 days after anthesis, while the level was markedly decreased during the fruit growing stage. the highest expression of gob was detected at 3 days before anthesis and then the expression level gradually decreased. expression of lewus and ls reached their peak at anthesis and then decreased gradually, similar to that of gob. unlike the other three genes, expression of lewus increased again during the fruit growing stage and its highest expression was detected at 3 weeks after anthesis. next, we examined the effects of a flower abscission signal on the transcript levels of the four genes . abscission of the pedicel az is stimulated by removing the flower from the pedicel. following this treatment, 10% and 36% of pedicels were abscised after one and two days, respectively . after removing flowers, the expression of gob, ls and lewus at the pedicel immediately declined within  <dig> hours, but bl expression increased more than 5-fold after the treatment. subsequently, to identify the cells transcribing the  <dig> transcription factor genes, az regions at anthesis were examined by in situ hybridization. serial sections of the az regions were prepared and hybridized with the antisense probes for bl, gob, ls and lewus. as shown in figure 
2c, mrnas of bl, gob, ls and lewus were detected in the same cells; these cells were arranged as several lines within the vascular tissue between the cortex and central parenchyma. when the hybridizations were conducted with sense probes as negative controls, we detected no specific hybridization signals . the patterns of bl, gob, ls and lewus were similar to that of tapg <dig> , whose expression is reportedly detected around the vascular cells within the az tissue of the tomato pedicel
 <cit> .

discussion
several pathways in anthesis pedicel azs may be shared with the regulation of shoot apical meristems 
our analyses of gene expression in anthesis pedicels revealed distinct expression patterns in the az compared to other pedicel tissues, prox and dis regions. we previously showed that the transcription factors regulating shoot meristem maintenance and lateral shoot development, lewus, bl, gob and ls, are expressed in anthesis pedicel azs
 <cit> . in addition to these four genes, here we identified several homologues of transcription factor genes that were identified to regulate meristem activities. tkn <dig> and bl <dig>  both of which were up-regulated in az, encode homologues of arabidopsis knox and bell family transcription factors, respectively, which form a heterodimer required for sam function
 <cit> . moreover, our analyses also revealed az specific up-regulation of ovate, the homologue of which binds to the knox-bell heterodimer complex and modulates activity of the complex
 <cit> . in addition, another transcription pathway found in the sam may also be activated in anthesis pedicels. arabidopsis yab genes, which are expressed in abaxial domains of leaves, promote stem cell activity in the meristem through the activity of lateral suppressor , which is expressed at the boundary of the leaf organ primordium and sam central zone
 <cit> . our analyses found that the las homologue ls was expressed in the az and the yab homologues were expressed outside of the az, in the prox and dis regions , suggesting the similarity of the spatial expression patterns of the las and yab family genes between pedicels and shoot apices. this evidence supports our proposal that transcriptional regulation occurring in azs is shared with the regulation found in sams. if so, how does this common regulation act on these dissimilar tissues and what cell activities does it regulate? observations of pedicel azs showed that small cells with densely packed cytoplasm are arranged within azs
 <cit>  and these cells are assumed to be maintained in an undifferentiated state
 <cit> . therefore, one plausible explanation is that the common regulatory system in pedicel azs and sams may serve to maintain small, undifferentiated cells in both tissues. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that wus and knox, with homologues that were up-regulated in pedicel azs, are the key genes regulating maintenance of undifferentiated meristem cells
 <cit> . moreover, a recent investigation showed that knox family genes determine the timing of floral organ abscission via regulation of the size and proliferation of the az cells
 <cit> . in addition, pedicel azs can develop adventitious shoots, although the event is rare
 <cit> , also supporting the possibility that pedicel azs contain cells with features similar to sam cells.

involvement of lewus, bl, gob and ls in regulation of competency to respond to abscission-promoting signaling
here we analyzed expression specificities of lewus, bl, gob and ls in pedicels to unveil the functions of these az-specific genes in abscission. expression patterns of these  <dig> genes were remarkably altered by an abscission-initiating stimulus; transcript levels of lewus, gob and ls declined significantly and bl was substantially up-regulated . the alternations were significantly different from the expression pattern changes that occur in normal tissue development . thus, these four transcription factor genes are likely to be involved in the regulation of the onset of abscission. the expression patterns suggest that bl may be a positive regulator of abscission whereas other three may be negative regulators. during normal tissue development, the expression peaks of these four genes occurred within a few days before and after anthesis . the developmental stage appears to be critical to determine whether the organ is abscised or transited to the growth phase. therefore, the tissue may require high level expression of positive and negative regulators to respond immediately to either of the fates. if the tissue is to be abscised, the positive regulators would be up-regulated and the negative ones down-regulated. alternatively, if the tissue is to transit to the growth phase, the high level expression of both regulators may not be required, probably because abscission is suppressed by the stable supply of the abscission inhibitor auxin from the fruit.

the difference in responses between bl and the other  <dig> genes was unexpected because the az specific expression of all these genes is simultaneously regulated by mc and jointless
 <cit> , and a previous study proposed that regulator of axillary meristem , cup-shaped cotyledon  and las, which are arabidopsis homologues of bl, gob and ls, are positive regulators that compose a transcription cascade in the axillary meristem
 <cit> . a converse hypothesis, that rax and las are elements of two independent transcription pathways, was also proposed
 <cit> . the expression of bl, lewus, gob and ls in az may be regulated by dual mechanisms, in which a common regulatory factor may induce these four genes before the onset of anthesis, and once an abscission signal is provided, different transcriptional regulators may up-regulate bl or down-regulate the other three genes.

the expression properties of lewus and gob indicate a probable explanation for the physiological changes in pedicel az cells during abscission. histological analysis of the tomato pedicel az revealed that the separation zone cells that remain small before abscission do enlarge just after the onset of abscission
 <cit> . it has been proposed that the enlargement of az cells at the onset of abscission produces a force that ruptures the separation zone
 <cit> . as described above, wus functions to maintain cells in an undifferentiated state in sams; cuc, a homologue of gob, also acts to keep cell size small
 <cit> . therefore, the reduced expression of gob and lewus caused by an abscission signal may result in the enlargement of the separation zone cells for the onset of abscission. of the four genes, only lewus showed increased expression at 3 weeks after anthesis. because the separation zone cells increase until the mature green fruit stage
 <cit> , increasing activity of lewus may be required to maintain the physiology of the cells.

as shown in figure 
2c, lewus, bl, gob and ls were all expressed in the vascular cells of the pedicel, but not in the small cells at the separation zone. in sams, wus regulates stem cell activity and is expressed in cells underneath the stem cells, but not in the stem cells themselves
 <cit> . rax, cuc and las, the homologues of bl, gob and ls, respectively, are expressed in a boundary region between the sam and leaf primordium
 <cit> . if separation zone cells in the pedicel azs possess similar properties with sams as described above, the expression of lewus, bl, gob and ls outside of the separation zone cells is consistent with the observation in sams. these four genes may regulate activities of the separation zone cells in azs through non-cell autonomous mechanisms similar to the regulation of sam activity by wus or las <cit> . although the functions of these  <dig> genes in pedicel azs is still unclear, our expression analyses suggest that these four genes make significant contributions to the response to the onset of the abscission. further investigation will provide key insights into the functions of these transcription factors in the regulation of abscission.

an auxin gradient may be formed in the pedicel and affect gene expression
several lines of evidence indicate that auxin and ethylene are critical factors that regulate the onset of abscission, and auxin plays a role in maintenance of flower or fruit attachment to the plants
 <cit> . our results revealed that expression patterns of genes that are involved in auxin signaling and auxin homeostasis were obviously different in the three pedicel regions, az, prox and dis. homologues of the genes for iaa amide synthases dfl1/gh <dig>   and gh <dig>   were preferentially expressed in az and dis, respectively, but no homologue was found in the genes preferentially expressed in the prox region. iaa amide synthase genes are induced in auxin-abundant tissues and the gene products inactivate iaa to control auxin homeostasis
 <cit> , suggesting that the auxin concentrations in the dis and az regions at anthesis are higher than that in the prox region. meanwhile, genes preferentially expressed in the az included a homologue of the gene for mes <dig> , which can convert an inactive form of iaa, iaa-methyl ester , into the active form, iaa
 <cit> . these results suggest that the level of active iaa in az at anthesis may be fine-tuned in a complex manner. these opposite reactions, namely activation and inactivation of iaa, may occur in different cell-groups within the az to maintain its pre-abscission status. we also found a homologue of iaa <dig>  an auxin-inducible transcription factor gene
 <cit> , in the genes preferentially expressed in the dis region . the expression of the iaa <dig> homologue was the highest in the dis region and gradually decreased toward prox . in addition, several genes that may play roles in auxin signaling, such as homologues of myb <dig>  and nac <dig> , had more abundant transcripts in dis than in prox . these results also support the possibility that an auxin gradient is formed in the pedicel tissues. in contrast, the transcript level of the auxin response factor arf <dig> homologue was significantly higher in prox . generally, transcription factor activities of arfs are modulated by post-transcriptional regulation; arf activity is inhibited by conjugation of aux/iaa proteins and the arfs are activated when the auxin level in the cell is elevated and the increased auxin induces degradation of the conjugated aux/iaas
 <cit> . although it is unknown whether the transcript level of the arf <dig> homologue in prox is regulated by auxin concentration, the high level expression in prox suggests that the prox region may show a response to auxin that is distinct from the az and dis regions. these different responses to auxin are likely to reflect the different gene expression patterns in each tissue. because the auxin level determines the timing of onset of pedicel abscission
 <cit> , the auxin signaling genes found in this study, especially those expressed in az and dis region, may be involved in preventing the onset of abscission.

mads box proteins may be key factors that determine the identities of pedicel regions
our results showed that despite their similar external appearances, the prox and dis regions in anthesis pedicels have distinct expression profiles. in particular, the dis region is characterized by the specific expression of the genes related to floral organ development such as homologues of ap <dig>  and mads box genes agl <dig> , ap <dig> , sep <dig>  and sep <dig> , suggesting that dis has floral organ like identity at the gene expression level . by contrast, the prox region cells specifically expressed a homologue of soc <dig> , which encodes another mads box protein that regulates the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth
 <cit> . the region-specific expression of transcription factor genes that determine distinct cell fates suggests that the prox and dis tissues have distinct developmental identities.

our previous study indicated that the mads box genes mc and jointless, which are expressed throughout the pedicel tissues, regulate pedicel az development and also induce az specific expression of lewus, bl, gob and ls <cit> . these observations suggest that mads box transcription factors may substantially contribute to specification of the identity of the pedicel regions. the mads box proteins that are expressed in each pedicel region may form region-specific protein complexes and determine the identities of each region, similarly to the quartet model proposed in flower organ identification
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to unveil the transcriptional properties of tomato pedicels at the pre-abscission state, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of three flower pedicel regions, prox, az and dis. the gene expression data indicated that there are substantial differences between az and non-az tissues , and also between prox and dis. in particular, genes involved in auxin activity showed distinct expression patterns in the pedicel regions, suggesting that a gradient of auxin concentration may be formed throughout the pedicel regions and this auxin gradient may be one of the key factors affecting the distinct expression patterns in the pedicel tissues. these auxin-related genes may play a critical role in the regulation of timing of abscission. various groups of transcription factors were also expressed in a region-specific manner, and of these, different types of mads-box transcription factor genes were found in different regions. for example, the dis region cells express the mads-box genes required for floral organ development, whereas the prox region cells express another mads-box gene regulating flowering. several types of mads-box protein complexes may form in the respective pedicel regions specifically to regulate gene expression, similarly to the floral quartet model. a couple of transcription factor genes associated with apical or axillary shoot meristem function were found to be expressed preferentially in the az, indicating that shoot meristem cells and az cells may have common meristematic functions. finally, the detailed gene expression analyses of bl, gob, ls and lewus suggest that these az specific transcription factor genes may be key factors responding to an abscission cue, although the regulatory pathways may be different between these four genes; bl may be a positive regulator of abscission and the other three may be negative regulators.

in conclusion, this study identifies multiple differentially expressed factors that may be important in establishing and maintaining the properties of pre-abscission tomato pedicel azs, and provides insights into the transcriptional regulation of pre-abscission responses. especially, comparative study of genes commonly expressed in both azs and sams may provide a new aspect of the regulation in the abscission. in addition, the pedicel region specific mads box transcription factors would be attractive candidates for the regulators determining pedicel tissue identities.
