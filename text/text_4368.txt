BACKGROUND
type i diabetes  is an autoimmune disease, resulting from destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in the islets of langerhans by autoreactive t cells. the non-obese diabetic  mice, which are predisposed to develop the disease, have served as a model for studying the mechanism, pathogenesis and interventions of the human disease  <cit> . in nod mice, a unique major histocompatibility complex  class ii allele  in combination with a defect in the programmed cell death pathway is thought to permit autoreactive t cells to escape negative selection in the thymus  <cit> . in the periphery, additional defects in peripheral tolerance mechanisms enable activation of the autoreactive t cells  <cit> , leading to the disease development.

besides development and activation of autoreactive t cells, factors that regulate t cell trafficking likely contribute to the disease development because destruction of β-cells requires infiltration of autoreactive t cells into the islets. chemokines are a group of low molecular weight proteins and regulate cell trafficking by binding to specific g-protein-coupled seven-span transmembrane receptors on target cells. for example, cxcl <dig>  also known as stromal cell derived factor- <dig> , and its receptor cxcr <dig> play a critical role in regulating hematopoietic cell trafficking  <cit> . it is required for fetal liver-derived hematopoietic stem cells  to colonize the bone marrow during embrogenesis and retention/homing of these cells in the bone marrow in the adult. it also regulates trafficking of many other cell types that express cxcr <dig>  including lymphocytes and cancer stem cells. in humans, polymorphisms in cxcl <dig> gene are linked to tid  <cit> . in nod mice, the onset of diabetes is significantly delayed by reducing the level of cxcl <dig> either by antibody-mediated neutralization or g-csf-induced suppression of cxcl <dig> transcription  <cit> . despite these initial observations, however, how chemokine cxcl <dig> affects development of tid has not been fully investigated.

in this report, we show that expression of chemokine cxcl <dig> is elevated in the bone marrow of nod mice, resulting in accumulation of both t cells and hsc in the bone marrow. treatment of nod mice with cxcr <dig> antagonist amd <dig>  <cit>  mobilizes t cells from the bone marrow to peripheral lymphoid tissues, and significantly delays the onset of insulitis and diabetes. our findings suggest that the elevated cxcl <dig> expression in the bone marrow likely promotes tid in nod mice by altering t cell trafficking and stem cell mobilization.

RESULTS
naive t cells accumulate in the bone marrow of nod mice
compared to age-matched balb/c or c57bl/ <dig> mice, prediabetic nod mice  had a significantly higher percentage of cd4+ t cells  in the bone marrow . the increase was even more pronounced in diabetic nod mice , reaching up to 15-fold of that in balb/c mice . correspondingly, the number of cd <dig> t cells in the bone marrow of prediabetic nod mice  was  <dig> times higher than that in the balb/c bone marrow , although both bone marrows had similar number of cells  . in diabetic nod mice, the percentages of cd <dig> t cells in the bone marrow increased with age  and the increase was correlated with a decrease of cd <dig> t cell number in the spleen . a similar increase in the percentage and number of cd <dig> t cells was also observed in the bone marrow of nod mice .

to investigate the role of inflammation or hyperglycemia in the t cell accumulation in the bone marrow of nod mice, we used 4– <dig> week-old nod mice, in which insulitis  was minimal. as shown in figure 1e, the percentage of cd <dig> t cells in the bone marrow was still significantly higher  than in age-matched balb/c mice . furthermore, in ea <dig> mice, which do not develop diabetes because the transgenic expression of an i-e molecule confers almost complete protection from insulitis of nod mice  <cit> , the percentage of cd <dig> t cells in the bone marrow was significantly increased as compared to balb/c mice . in addition, most cd <dig> t cells in the bone marrow of prediabetic nod mice were cd44locd45rbhicd25- naïve t cells . the proportion of the naïve t cells increased as the nod mice became diabetic. together, these results show that naïve t cells accumulate in the bone marrow of nod mice.

increased homing leads to t cell accumulation in the bone marrow of nod mice
to determine if t cell accumulation in the bone marrow of nod mice was due to proliferation, t cells in the bone marrow were stained for cycling marker ki <dig>  no significant difference in the percentages of ki67+proliferating cd <dig> t cells was detected in the bone marrow of prediabetic nod mice and age-matched balb/c mice . as in balb/c mice, the proliferating cd <dig> t cells in the bone marrow of nod mice were cd44hi effector or memory t cells.

to investigate the role of recruitment in t cell accumulation in the bone marrow, total t cells were purified from nod and balb/c mice, labeled with cfse, and transferred into both nod and balb/c mice. distribution of cfse-positive donor cd <dig> t cells in the recipients was assayed  <dig> hours following the transfer. no significant difference was detected in t cell distribution in the lymph nodes between balb/c and nod mice when either nod or balb/c t cells were transferred , demonstrating that t cells from balb/c and nod mice have equivalent motility. however, significantly more transferred balb/c and nod t cells were detected in the bone marrow of nod than balb/c mice . forty-eight hours after the transfer, the difference between t cell distribution in the bone marrow of nod and balb/c recipients was even greater . therefore, enhanced recruitment likely contributes to the accumulation of naïve t cells in the bone marrow of nod mice. because the enhanced recruitment is restricted to the bone marrow and independent of the source of the donor t cells, factors that mediate the preferential homing of naïve t cells likely reside in the bone marrow of nod mice.

elevated cxcl <dig> expression promotes t cell recruitment to the bone marrow of nod mice
to identify chemokines that mediate the observed preferential t cell homing, we compared chemokine transcription in the bone marrow between nod and balb/c mice using mouse chemokines & receptors microarrays. only chemokine cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> transcripts were elevated in the bone marrow of nod mice as compared to balb/c mice . quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed that the cxcl <dig> transcript was 3– <dig> fold higher in the bone marrow of nod than balb/c mice , whereas the difference in the level of ccl <dig> transcript was not confirmed. consistently, the level of cxcl <dig> transcript was significantly higher in the bone marrow of 4– <dig> week-old nod mice and ea <dig> mice than their respective age-matched controls . in addition, majority of cd <dig> t cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of nod mice that expressed cxcr <dig> were cd45rb+ naïve t cells , consistent with their accumulation in the bone marrow. although only a few percentages of cd <dig> t cells stained positive for surface cxcr <dig>  all cd <dig> t cells from both nod and c57bl/ <dig> mice were positive for intracellular staining of cxcr <dig> .

amd <dig> is a low molecular weight antagonist of cxcr <dig>  <cit> . if interaction of cxcl <dig> with cxcr <dig> is critical for the observed t cell accumulation, treatment of nod mice with amd <dig> should inhibit t cell accumulation in the bone marrow. thus, prediabetic nod mice were given amd <dig>  daily for  <dig> days and the distribution and phenotype of t cells in their bone marrow were assayed. amd <dig> treatment significantly reduced the proportion of both cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells in the bone marrow of the prediabetic nod mice as compared to prediabetic nod mice that were given pbs . in particular, the proportion of cd <dig> t cells with the naïve phenotype  was preferentially reduced in the amd <dig> treated nod mice . together with cxcl12's known function in regulating t cell migration  <cit> , these results demonstrate that the elevated cxcl <dig> expression results in the accumulation of naïve t cells in the bone marrow of nod mice.

elevated cxcl <dig> expression promotes recruitment/retention of regulatory t cells  and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow
the elevated cxcl <dig> expression is expected to promote recruitment or retention of other cell types/subsets that express cxcr <dig> in the bone marrow of nod mice. although no significant difference in percentage or number of nkt cells, dendritic cells or b cells was detected in the bone marrow between nod and balb/c mice  nor any change in distribution of these cell types in nod mice following amd <dig> treatment , the numbers of foxp3+cd4+ tregs were consistently higher in the bone marrow of prediabetic nod mice than balb/c mice . a lower percentage of cd <dig> t cells that are tregs in the bone marrow of nod mice as compared to balb/c mice likely reflects the greater accumulation of naïve cd <dig> t cells than tregs in the nod bone marrow. to unequivocally determine the involvement of cxcl12-cxcr <dig> interaction in regulating treg trafficking, we used mice in which cxcr <dig> expression was specifically inactivated in t cells via cre-mediated recombination  <cit> . in the absence of cxcr <dig>  the numbers of treg in the bone marrow was decreased significantly whereas the number of treg in the spleen was increased as compared to littermate wildtype mice . thus, treg trafficking into the bone marrow is partly regulated by cxcl <dig> 

cxcl <dig> plays a critical role in retention of hsc in the bone marrow of adult mice  <cit> . as expected, the number of lin-sca1+c-kit+ hsc was significantly higher in the bone marrow of prediabetic nod mice than in age-matched balb/c mice . following amd <dig> treatment for  <dig> days, the number of hsc in the bone marrow of nod mice was significantly reduced.

interference of cxcr <dig> function delays the development of diabetes in nod mice
to determine the relationship between cxcl12-mediated dysregulation of t cell and stem cell trafficking and development of diabetes, we treated nod mice with amd <dig> and monitored progression of the disease. as shown in figure 6a, prediabetic nod mice had significantly more insulin-expressing islets than diabetic nod mice . among age-matched prediabetic nod mice, amd <dig> treatment  significantly reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the islets  . when prediabetic nod mice  were given amd <dig> or pbs daily for three weeks, pbs-treated nod mice rapidly developed diabetes between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of age as indicated by glucose levels in the urine  . in contrast, none of the amd3100-treated mice developed glycosuria disease during the same period. however, two weeks after amd <dig> treatment was terminated, amd3100-treated mice began to develop diabetes and the incidence reached the same level  as pbs-treated mice by  <dig> weeks of age. to test whether continuous amd <dig> treatment can inhibit the development of diabetes, prediabetic nod mice  were given amd <dig> daily for  <dig> weeks. pbs-treated nod mice started to show evidence of diabetes at  <dig> weeks of age and by  <dig> weeks of age, all mice developed diabetes . in contrast, none of the amd3100-treated mice developed the disease during the same period. these results show that amd <dig> treatment inhibits leukocyte infiltration in the islets  and continuous treatment delays development of overt diabetes.

discussion
we show here that among all chemokines examined the level of cxcl <dig> transcript, which is tightly correlated with the protein level  <cit> , is significantly elevated in the bone marrow of nod mice as compared to balb/c mice. cxcl <dig> specifically stimulates chemotaxis of cells that express cxcr <dig>  <cit> . the elevated cxcl <dig> levels are therefore expected to have a significant effect on recruitment and retention of cxcr4-expressing cells in the bone marrow of nod mice. based on analyses of young, prediabetic, diabetic nod mice and ea <dig> mice, the phenotype of cxcr4-expressing t cells, the effect of amd <dig> treatment, and direct recruitment assay, our studies unequivocally demonstrate that the elevated cxcl <dig> expression results in recruitment and accumulation of naïve t cells in the bone marrow of nod mice. because there is no difference in the proportion of t cells that express cxcr <dig> between nod and balb/c mice, and because balb/c t cells are also preferentially recruited to the nod bone marrow, the observed recruitment and accumulation of naïve t cells in the bone marrow of nod mice appears to be due solely to the elevated cxcl <dig> expression. in addition, our results show that the elevated cxcl <dig> expression also leads to the accumulation/retention of tregs and hsc in the bone marrow.

what is the relationship between the elevated cxcl <dig> expression in the bone marrow and development of diabetes in nod mice? the elevated cxcl <dig> expression is unlikely a consequence of inflammation or hyperglycemia associated with insulitis or diabetes in nod mice because cxcl <dig> transcript was detected in the bone marrow of ea <dig> mice and young  nod mice. more likely, nod mice are predisposed to express elevated cxcl <dig> in the bone marrow. conversely, because ea <dig> mice do not develop diabetes despite the elevated cxcl <dig> expression and accumulation of t cells in the bone marrow, the elevated cxcl <dig> expression alone is insufficient to initiate diabetes in the absence of autoreactive t cells. nevertheless, the elevated cxcl <dig> expression likely promotes diabetes development. in humans, polymorphisms in cxcl <dig> gene are linked to susceptibility to tid  <cit> . using allele-specific transcript quantification in epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, one study reported evidence that polymorphisms have a cis-acting effect on cxcl <dig> transcription  <cit> . however, whether tid patients with specific cxcl <dig> polymorphisms have elevated cxcl <dig> expression has not been reported. in nod mice, neutralization of cxcl <dig> by administration of antibody suppresses insulitis and delays the onset of diabetes  <cit> . similarly, administration of g-csf, a cytokine known to induce suppression of cxcl <dig> transcription, also reduces insulitis and diabetes in nod mice  <cit> . consistent with these previous observations, we found that the elevated cxcl <dig> expression and its consequent effect on t cell trafficking are positively correlated with the disease progression in nod mice. complete freund adjuvant , which is known to inhibit diabetes development  <cit> , also inhibits cxcl <dig> expression  <cit>  and t cell accumulation in the bone marrow of nod mice . finally, treatment of prediabetic nod mice with amd <dig> abolishes t cell accumulation in the bone marrow and simultaneously inhibits disease development. together, these findings strongly suggest that cxcl <dig> promotes development of diabetes in nod mice and perhaps in humans.

our findings also suggest potential mechanisms by which the elevated cxcl <dig> expression promotes disease progression in nod mice. we found that the elevated cxcl <dig> expression leads to homing of naïve t cells to the bone marrow. a recent study showed that diabetogenic t cells also preferentially home to the bone marrow of nod mice  <cit> , perhaps as a result of the elevated cxcl <dig> expression shown here. it is possible that accumulation of t cells in the bone marrow of nod mice might lead to lymphopenia in the peripheral lymphoid organs and homeostatic proliferation and differentiation of autoreactive t cells  <cit> , which in turn promotes diabetes development. it is also possible that elevated cxcl <dig> expression may promote disease progression in nod mice through its effect on trafficking of autoreactive t cells, especially into islets. studies have shown that cxcl12-cxcr <dig> interaction is required for recruitment of autoreactive t cells to rheumatoid arthritis synovium and the inflamed joint of collagen-induced arthritis  <cit> . in a virus-induced tid model, blockade of cxcl <dig>  prevents diabetes development by impeding expansion of autoreactive t cells and their migration into the pancreas  <cit> . we showed that inhibition of cxcr <dig> by amd <dig> significantly reduced insulitis . although we did not detect any difference in cxcl <dig> expression in pancreas between prediabetic nod mice and balb/c mice , dysregulation of lymphocyte trafficking is likely a significant contributing factor to the development of tid in nod.

the elevated cxcl <dig> expression may promote disease progression in nod mice through its effect on treg trafficking, which is partly regulated by cxcl12-cxcr <dig> interaction. a large body of evidence suggests that tregs play a critical role in suppressing autoimmunity  <cit> . in nod mice, the frequency and function of foxp3+ tregs were reported to decrease with age  <cit> . we show that more tregs were present in the bone marrow of nod mice than age-matched balb/c mice. following amd <dig> treatment of nod mice, the number of tregs was significantly decreased in the bone marrow whereas the number was significantly increased in the spleen . however, because the number of tregs in the bone marrow is only about one tenth of that in the spleen, treg mobilization from the bone marrow alone cannot account for the significant increase in treg numbers in the spleen. regardless where the splenic tregs come from, because a threshold ratio of tregs to autoreactive t cells is important for treg suppression of autoreactive t cells  <cit> , sequestering tregs in the bone marrow or some other organs in nod mice may tip the balance in favor of autoreactive t cells.

the elevated cxcl <dig> expression also leads to retention of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow of nod mice. because bone marrow-derived stem cells initiate pancreatic regeneration  <cit> , it is possible that sequestering hsc and possibly other stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow might contribute to disease progression in nod mice by limiting their availability for islet regeneration. in support of this notion, systemic administration of cxcl <dig> ameliorates diabetes  <cit> , perhaps partly by mobilizing hsc from the bone marrow to the periphery. the same mechanism may partly explain the effectiveness of cfa plus adoptive transfer of splenocytes, which contain a significant number of hsc and probably other progenitor cells  <cit> , in curing diabetic nod mice through regeneration of islets  <cit> .

amd <dig> was originally developed to treat hiv infection through its antagonism of the cxcr <dig>  a co-receptor for the virus  <cit> . currently, it is being developed as an agent to mobilize hsc from bone marrow to peripheral blood for transplantation of stem cells in patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple myeloma  <cit> . we found that amd <dig> treatment of prediabetic nod mice significantly delays insulitis and the onset of diabetes. in contrast, a recent study reported that amd <dig> treatment promotes diabetes development in a model where diabetes was induced by adoptive transfer of splenocytes from female nod mice into sublethally irradiated male nod mice  <cit> . in the transfer model, transferred t cells undergo homeostatic proliferation and acquire effector functions  <cit> . irradiation of the recipient mice also introduces additional factors and processes which are not active in the non-irradiated prediabetic mice. thus, the disease induction mechanisms in the transfer model could be significantly different from those in un-manipulated female nod mice. although the precise mechanism underlying the discrepancy between the two studies has yet to be determined, our finding provides a basis for further exploring the use of amd <dig> to prevent and/or treat tid and possibly other autoimmune diseases in patients with elevated cxcl <dig> or cxcr <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
elevated cxcl <dig> expression in the bone marrow of nod mice likely promotes development of tid by altering t cell and hematopoietic stem cell trafficking. the findings suggest the possibility of preventing and/or treating tid in humans by modulating either the expression or function of cxcl <dig> and cxcr <dig>
