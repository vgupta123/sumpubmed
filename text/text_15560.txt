BACKGROUND
the sea lamprey  is a jawless fish that is native to the atlantic ocean. while it may also have been native to lake ontario  <cit> , sea lampreys only became abundant in the great lakes following improvements to the welland canal that connects lake ontario to lake erie and bypasses niagara falls. together with overfishing, the lamprey was responsible for the decline in lake trout populations in the laurentian great lakes  <cit> . as an adult, the sea lamprey is a parasite that attaches to fish with a rasping mouthpart and feeds off the tissues and body fluids of its host  <cit> . significant efforts have been made to control lamprey in the great lakes and, while populations have been reduced, lamprey parasitism still remains an issue that could be exacerbated by global climatic changes affecting the great lakes  <cit> . the sea lamprey can parasitize a number of large bodied fish species, however, in the great lakes the effects on lake trout have been the most dramatic and have had the most significant consequences.

there have been a number of laboratory studies looking at the rates and types of wounding by lampreys on various fish hosts . in contrast, there have been surprisingly few studies that have investigated the physiology of the host during or following lamprey parasitism. for obvious reasons, mortality has been a major focus of research on lamprey parasitism. however, since many fish may survive lamprey wounding  <cit> , it would be important to understand what occurs in the host during parasitism and how that could affect the physiology of the surviving host. several investigators have looked at blood parameters after wounding and have shown increases in circulating lymphocytes  <cit> , and decreases  <cit>  or increases  <cit>  in blood hematocrit. lampreys are parasites and foreign to their host, thus, it would be logical that the immune system of the host would react to the lamprey. however, to our knowledge there have been no investigations of the immune reaction of the host to lamprey parasitism. in other hematophagous parasites such as ticks, compounds are produced by the parasite that are released into the host to avoid host recognition or to block parts of the innate immune response . this is thought to be strategic so that the host will not mount an immune response to the parasite . we could hypothesize that similar activities might occur in a fish being parasitized by a lamprey.

interestingly, there have been a number of studies that have isolated bioactive compounds from the buccal glands of other parasitic lampreys including lampetra japonica. while a primary goal of those studies has been the isolation of compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications  <cit> , they have uncovered several interesting compounds that may be important to the natural biological relationship of the lamprey and its host during parasitism. these include compounds that are active as inhibitors of lymphocyte proliferation, neutrophil activity and platelet aggregation , ion channel blockers  <cit> , and compounds with fibrinolytic activity  <cit> .

while a number of morphotypes of lake trout were once present in the laurentian great lakes , only lake superior currently contains naturally sustaining populations of different lake trout types including the lean and siscowet lake trout. in the wild, siscowet lake trout morphotypes have larger fins and eyes, a shorter snout, larger caudal peduncle, and higher lipid content in the muscle than lean lake trout morphotypes  <cit> . lean lake trout tend to be distributed in waters shallower than 100 m while siscowet lake trout are found mostly at depths greater than 100 m  <cit> . in addition, lean and siscowet lake trout have different life histories with leans being shorter-lived, faster growing, maturing at a younger age, and experiencing higher mortality regimes  <cit> . studies have shown that some differences observed between wild siscowet and lean lake trout are likely to have a genetic or epigenetic basis  <cit> . these include differences in growth and lipid levels in the muscle. in fact, it appears that leans and siscowets represent metabolotypes that can be distinguished by differences in energy reserves in the liver and muscle  <cit> . given these differences in morphometry, physiology and life history, we were interested to see whether the response to lamprey parasitism would also differ between morphotypes. in the current study, lean and siscowet lake trout that have been reared in the hatchery from eggs to adults under identical environmental conditions  <cit>  were used for controlled lamprey parasitism experiments in the lab. endocrine and bioenergetic changes in relation to the lamprey parasitism on the hatchery-reared lake trout morphotypes have been presented separately  <cit> . here we describe the changes in the hepatic transcriptome of lean and siscowet lake trout following lamprey parasitism. the results indicate a strong transcriptional response to lamprey parasitism that may involve reactions to an inflammatory and antigenic response brought on by lamprey wounding, and also suggest that there may be an interesting interaction of the lamprey with the immune system of the host. responses to energy utilization as well as hydromineral balance were also observed, indicating an adjustment in the host to energy demands and osmotic imbalances that occur during parasitism.

discussion
the results of this study indicate that lamprey parasitism elicits a striking response in the hepatic transcriptome of both lean and siscowet lake trout. some of these responses are shared between morphotypes but some are not. since the fish were not perfused prior to tissue sampling, it is possible that some differences in gene expression could have been related to changes in the relative numbers of blood cells in parasitized versus nonparasitized fish as a result of wounding, but this would not affect changes in hepatic cell transcription. overall, many of the genes that were in the regulated list were enzymes involved with catalytic processes. this is not surprising since the liver is the site of many enzymatic processes involving carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism and some of these processes appear to be affected by the wounding as discussed in detail below. in addition, genes that are involved with pathway regulation such as binding factors as well as the response to cell death  were also in the list.

as an adult, lampreys attach with a rasping mouthpart and feed off the tissues and body fluids of their host  <cit> . this dramatic wounding activity would be expected to have a significant impact on the physiology of the host yet this has not been well characterized in the literature. increases in circulating lymphocytes particularly neutrophils  <cit> , and both decreases  <cit>  and increases  <cit>  in blood hematocrit have been reported. the wound that is produced during lamprey parasitism should have significant effects on the immune system of the host that could induce inflammatory and antigenic responses. curiously, the transcriptomic response observed following wounding was not typical in comparison to what might be observed during pathogen  exposure. for example, cytokines like interleukins   <dig> and  <dig> or tumor necrosis factor  were not in the regulated genes. it could be that these responses occurred at an earlier time just following parasitism and the sampling was completed after it. in support of this, genes  that are believed to be anti-inflammatory and produced to help regulate inflammatory reactions, were in the regulated gene list. it could also be that the reaction brought on by the parasite wounding is fundamentally different from that of a pathogen since interactions with cellular components of the immune system in the host would occur with pathogens and elicit typical cytokine responses. those interactions may not occur during lamprey wounding. still, the rna-seq analysis revealed the regulation of a number of genes in the liver following parasitism that could be a response to inflammation or tissue damage. for example, the most highly upregulated gene in siscowets was growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible protein , a gene that was originally characterized from cells that were subjected to agents such as uv, n-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and h2o <dig> that damage dna  <cit> . in humans there is a family of gadd <dig> proteins  that are stress sensors upregulated under various physiological and environmental stressors. they are associated with cellular proteins that are implicated in cell cycle regulation and the response of cells to stress including pcna , p <dig>  cdc2/cyclinb <dig>  and the p <dig> and jnk  stress response kinases . from the wound produced by lampreys we might expect to see the stimulation of various proinflammatory cytokines in the host and a number of these including il- <dig> have been shown to stimulate gadd <dig> proteins  <cit> . the reported outcome of gadd <dig> stimulation is complex and can be both cell protective or pro-apoptotic . to some extent this may depend upon the circumstance and/or the type of gadd <dig> protein being regulated  <cit> . how it may be functioning in the specific case of lamprey parasitism is unknown but the association of the regulation of this protein with wounding is logical given what is know about the function of these proteins. very little has been published on gadd <dig> in fish though it has been proposed to be involved in demethylation and somatogenesis in zebrafish  <cit>  and it has been reported to be regulated in the liver of the antarctic fish, trematomus bernacchii, during heat stress  <cit> . other genes that would logically be upregulated during stress such as the ccaat/enhancer binding protein  <cit>  were present in the gene lists for both leans and siscowets but were not significantly upregulated according to their adjusted p values. in contrast, heat shock proteins, also involved in cellular stress responses, were significantly  upregulated in both leans and siscowets  though they were not in the top  <dig> upregulated gene lists.

significant upregulation of gadd <dig> was also observed in parasitized leans ; though not in the top  <dig> upregulated genes. instead, the most significantly upregulated gene in leans was the interleukin-18-binding protein  in both deseq <dig> and edger analyses. this gene was also in the top  <dig> upregulated genes in parasitized siscowets. as indicated earlier, the wounding produced by the lamprey could produce an inflammatory reaction in the host and thus we could expect to see the expression of proinflammatory genes such as interleukins. interleukin  <dig>  has been identified in fish but the function is unclear  <cit> . in mammals, il- <dig> is a cytokine that strongly stimulates interferon gamma. it is considered a proinflammatory cytokine but the actions are somewhat different compared to tnfα or il- <dig>  <cit> . interleukin  <dig> binding protein is an extracellular protein that has very high affinity for il- <dig> and in mammals is believed to play a role in modulating the action of il- <dig> given its strong activation of interferon  <cit> . if il- <dig> has a similar function in fish, then the strong upregulation of the il- <dig> binding protein may indicate that il- <dig> is being upregulated in response to lamprey parasitism. it is important to note that il18bp has homology to the interleukin  <dig> receptor, type  <dig> that is considered to be a decoy receptor for il- <dig>  <cit>  and this is upregulated in fish during lps stimulation  <cit> . in addition, we did not find any upregulation of interferon. thus, given the similarity in structure, it is unclear whether il- <dig> or il- <dig> binding protein is actually being regulated.

in contrast to the upregulated genes, there was less consensus between the deseq <dig> and edger analyses for the top downregulated genes in siscowets or leans even though many downregulated genes were shared between the analyses. in siscowets, two genes, c-c motif chemokine  <dig>  and gtp-binding protein rhes  were shared between the two analyses and were in the top three downregulated genes. in general, chemokines are leukocyte attractants that are involved during normal homeostasis and inflammatory conditions  <cit> . however, not much is known about chemokine  <dig> and, given the large number of chemokines, it is possible that the regulated sequence may actually be another structurally similar chemokine. gtp-binding protein rhes is a gtp binding protein that is highly expressed in the mammalian brain and, in particular, the striatum  <cit> . however, it appears not to be expressed in the liver of mammals. recently, rasd <dig> has been shown to be an agent that activates autophagy in the brain  <cit> . autophagy is a self-degradative process that can occur at different cellular levels and is involved in normal homeostasis and organelle and energy recycling, but can be ramped up during periods of cellular stress  <cit> . we could not find any reports on rasd <dig> in fish but given the role in autophagy, upregulation of it may be relevant to degradative processes occurring during lamprey parasitism.

in leans, the top downregulated gene in the deseq <dig> analysis was udp-glucuronosyltransferase 2a <dig>  and in edger it was phosphotriesterase related  protein. udp-glucuronosyltransferases are well studied enzymes that catalyze the formation of lipophilic glucuronides from substrates, including steroids, bile acids, bilirubin, hormones, dietary constituents, and thousands of xenobiotics using udp-glucuronic acid as a cosubstrate  <cit> . as such they allow for solubilization and removal of lipophilic products that otherwise might be toxic to the body  <cit> . glucuronidation has been frequently studied in the liver and involvement of this process is certainly consistent with the conditions occurring during lamprey parasitism where agents arising from inflammation or introduced into the host from the parasite  might be toxic. therefore, why this gene would be downregulated rather than upregulated is unclear unless this was a result of some feedback activity to try and control this process. phosphotriesterase related protein is more of an enigma since very little is known about the function of this protein in vertebrates. the pter gene has been identified in mice, rats, humans and bombyx mori  <cit> . the precise role of this gene is unclear but in mice, silencing this gene using rna interference diminished albuminuria-induced inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine production in kidney tubular cells  <cit> . thus, downregulation of this gene in the fish liver may be associated with the continued expression of inflammatory agents as a result of parasitism.

in this study we used and compared the results of two rna-seq analyses; deseq <dig> and edger. we were interested to see how consistent the results were across analyses and across morphotype. compared to edger, deseq <dig> found a greater number of regulated genes in parasitized leans and siscowets. when looking at genes downregulated during parasitism there was good agreement between the results of the two analyses within a morphotype with  <dig> and  <dig> of the top  <dig> genes shared for both leans and siscowets, respectively. that was also the case for the top upregulated genes in parasitized sicowets but not for leans where only five genes were shared between the two analyses in the top  <dig>  why this particular comparison did not show consistent results between analyses while others did is not clear. interestingly the edger analysis for the top upregulated genes in parasitized leans had several occurrences of cyclic amp-dependent transcription factor atf- <dig> , a protein that is well characterized as being involved with cellular stress brought on by various stimuli including cytokines, genotoxic agents, apoptotic factors as well as conditions that promote amino acid and glucose deprivation  <cit> . given the inflammatory reaction and probable load on the host energy stores following parasitism, upregulation of this gene in the liver is logical.

that the rna-seq analysis was accurately depicting the differential regulation of genes in parasitized versus nonparasitized lake trout livers was also confirmed by qpcr. all of the qpcr analyses indicated the correct direction of regulation and nearly all were significant when statistically analyzed.

while the analysis of regulated genes on an individual basis is interesting, a more global approach would be to look at the regulation of potential physiological or cellular pathways involving suites of regulated genes. we used ipa analysis to try and address this. given the caveat that the pathways derived within ipa are based primarily on the proposed functions of their genes in mammals, this analysis indicated some interesting pathways that appeared to be regulated during lamprey parasitism in the liver. in this analysis, we employed a conservative approach using the edger rna-seq gene analysis that had fewer genes overall than the deseq <dig> analysis, together with the benjamini-hochberg method to determine the significance of gene overlap with those of the ipa pathways. while we could have used the gene list from the intersection of the deseq <dig> and edger analyses, we felt that some pathway information could be lost since those gene lists were greatly reduced compared with those from deseq <dig> or edger. as observed with the number of individually regulated genes, there were more significant pathways uncovered with parasitized siscowets than leans. however, a number of these pathways were still shared between the morphotypes. in leans, the top functional pathway was protein ubiquitination and a majority of the genes in this pathway were upregulated. in the context of the ipa analysis, the protein ubiquitination pathway refers to gene products involved in the degradation of short-lived or regulatory proteins including ones in the cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, dna repair, transcriptional regulation, cell surface receptors, ion channel regulators, and antigen presentation. all of these processes would logically be associated with lamprey parasitism particularly proteins involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis given the strong upregulation of genes such as gadd <dig>  while the protein ubiquitination pathway was also stimulated in siscowets this was not as significant as in leans . in contrast, tryptophan degradation was the most significantly regulated pathway in siscowets but was also very highly regulated in leans . tryptophan is an essential amino acid that can be a substrate for serotonin synthesis. however, when metabolized, approximately 95 % of tryptophan goes into the kynurenine  pathway  <cit> . the rate-limiting step in the kyn pathway is the enzyme that converts tryptophan to n-formylkynurenine. it is now known that at least three enzymes can do this: tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase , indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase- <dig>  and indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase- <dig>   <cit> . studies have demonstrated that some fish species have genes for all three of these enzymes though efficiency for the conversion of tryptophan by the fish ido <dig> enzyme is very low compared with mammals while ido <dig> has moderate efficiency compared to mammals  <cit> . in mammals, tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase is found predominantly in the liver, while ido <dig> and two are also found in the kidney and testes and less in the liver  <cit> . following the formation of kynurenines, there are two possible outcomes in the kyn pathway; a nonenzymatic conversion to quinolinic acid or conversion to 2-aminomuconic acid 6-semialdehyde by 2-amino 3-carboxymuconate 6-semialdehyde decarboxylase   <cit> . interestingly, in both siscowets and leans the genes in the tryptophan degradation pathway were nearly all downregulated  suggesting a strong inhibition of this pathway. in addition, in siscowets another pathway, tryptophan degradation to 2-amino 3-carboxymuconate, was also downregulated which would be the pathway catalyzed by acsd. consistent with these pathway observations, the genes for indoleamine  <dig>  dioxygenase  as well as acsd were consistently and significantly downregulated in the deseq <dig> and edger analyses in both parasitized siscowets and leans . other pathways that were regulated according to the ipa analysis and are related to tryptophan metabolism include glutaryl-coa degradation and nad biosynthesis ii .

the kyn pathway has been strongly linked to immune function in mammals in various ways. for example: 1) kynurenine metabolites produced in the kyn pathway can have direct effects on cells by the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor; 2) local depletion of tryptophan in a cell can activate a local stress response stimulating cell cycle kinases and transcription factors ; and 3) ido can, in addition to being an enzyme, act directly as a cellular signaling molecule  <cit> . the net result of kyn activation is complex and can involve many inputs. in mammals the kyn pathway is stimulated during inflammatory reactions via interferons but the kynurenine metabolites produced may ultimately function as immunsuppressors  <cit> . indeed, it is known that ido stimulation promotes immunotolerance of grafted allogeneic tissues whereas inhibition of ido results in rejection  <cit> . so one hypothesis is that the stimulation of ido results in dampening of the immune response and immunotolerance. thus, predicting the overall immune response of downregulating or upregulating this pathway is difficult particularly since it is unknown if there are similar ido functions in fish. as far as we can tell, the relationship of the kyn pathway and immunity has not been investigated in any fish species though transcripts encoding ido <dig> were downregulated in rainbow trout fry following challenge with flavobacterium psychrophilum  <cit> . it seems clear that this pathway is downregulated following lamprey parasitism and if the kyn pathway is ultimately immunosuppressive in fish and acts to temper the inflammatory reaction, then downregulation might be a mechanism to block immunosuppression and continue to respond to the presence of the lamprey .

the kyn pathway has been extensively investigated during infections by intracellular parasitic protozoans such as leishmania major  <cit> . during leishmaniasis the kyn pathway is stimulated resulting in local depletion of tryptophan and kynurenine production. in gene knockout mice lacking ido or foliowing the application of ido inhibitors, there is actually a decrease in leismania infection suggesting that pathogens such as leishmania may act to suppress the host immune system by stimulating the kyn pathway and thereby promoting immunotolerance  <cit> . in other parasitic lampreys  a number of products have been isolated from the buccal gland  <cit>  that are probably released around the wound site and into the host circulation. as with other hematophagous parasites, some of these compounds are probably released to keep blood from coagulating so that feeding of the circulation by the lamprey can continue. indeed, experiments conducted some time ago on the sea lamprey demonstrated that fluid obtained directly from the buccal glands inhibited clotting of fish blood  <cit> . at the same time it was found that injection of small volumes of sea lamprey buccal gland secretion into the muscle of nonparasitized fish caused the formation of very large edemas suggesting the presence of compounds that could be highly cytolytic. some compounds in the buccal gland secretions may be released in an attempt to block the immune response of the host or be used to hide from the host. curiously, l-3-hydroxykynurenine o-sulfate has been isolated from the buccal glands of the parasitic lamprey, lethenteron japonicum  <cit> . could this kynurenine be released by the lamprey into the circulation of the fish host and act to mimic the stimulation of the host's kyn system? if so, this may be a mechanism that the parasite uses to promote immunosuppression so that it can continue to parasitize the host. in any case, compounds  that are produced by the lamprey and released into the circulation during parasitism may add to the overall antigenic response occurring within the host and be responsible for some of the pathways being simulated.

two carbohydrate bioenergetic pathways that were regulated were glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. these were regulated significantly in both leans and siscowets but glycolysis was regulated to a greater extent in leans than siscowets . glycolysis is the process in which glucose is metabolized to pyruvate and results in the production of atp. gluconeogenesis is the reverse of glycolysis and hence the production of glucose. while most of the reactions in glycolysis are reversible there are some differences primarily as a result of the steps in which energy is produced and these include the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate to glucose. while not dramatic, another difference between leans and siscowets with regard to glycolysis was that in leans it appeared that there was a greater proportion of genes upregulated  while in siscowets it was almost equal or even slightly more downregulated . in the wild, siscowets have higher muscle lipid than leans and this is a heritable trait  <cit> . in fact, leans and siscowets can be considered metabolotypes in which a number of energetic characteristics are different between them including lipid  and glycogen   <cit> . given the consumption of host tissue and blood, lamprey parasitism must be bioenergetically draining, and how the host compensates for that most likely depends on the way energy is stored. given the differences in lipid and carbohydrate between the two morphotypes, it may not be surprising that glycolysis is upregulated in leans to a greater extent than in siscowets. in addition, in siscowets several ipa pathways involved in lipid metabolism or the regulation of lipid metabolism were regulated including lxr/rxr  activation, ppar  signaling, and pxr/rxr  activation  <cit> . none of these pathways were observed to be regulated in parasitized leans. it appears that in the wild, siscowets are parasitized at a higher rate and more intensely than leans  <cit> . while there could be several reasons for this difference, the high lipid levels in siscowets may make them more capable energetically of sustaining lamprey parasitism events.

two other pathways that were significantly regulated in both leans and siscowets were aldosterone signaling in epithelial cells and glucocorticoid receptor signaling and these may be related. based on p values these two pathways appeared to be more highly regulated in leans than siscowets and for both morphotypes there was a greater proportion of genes that were upregulated. in the case of ipa the aldosterone signaling in epithelial cells involves genes of the phosphatidylinositol and protein kinase c intracellular signaling pathways as well as na+/k+atpase pumps and channels. the glucocorticoid receptor signaling involves some similar second messenger pathway genes but also genes involved in inflammation and cell cycle control. both of these pathways are logical given the possible inflammation associated with the parasitism and since there would likely be ionic/osmotic imbalances during the wounding, pathways involving ion pumps and channels would be logical. the cortisol stress response has been well documented in fish  <cit>  and it is likely that lake trout experiencing lamprey parasitism undergo stimulation of the hypothalamic pituitary interrenal axis that would result in elevated cortisol and the stimulation of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway. whether aldosterone really exists in fish is debated  <cit>  and the mineralcorticoid in fish may be other steroids. however, cortisol also functions as a mineralcorticoid in fish and, thus, the pathways designated as those specific to aldosterone in the ipa analysis could in effect be stimulated by cortisol, particularly those that regulate na+/k+ atpase  <cit> .

a major pathway that was significantly regulated in siscowets  but not in leans  was nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response. in ipa this pathway involves gene products that are regulated by the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor  <dig>  in response to oxidative stress caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and the detoxification of reactive intermediates by enzymes including glutathione s-transferase, cytochrome p <dig>  nad h:quinone oxidoreductase, heme oxygenase and superoxide dismutase. many things can cause oxidative stress but certainly inflammation is one of them and so it is not surprising to see this pathway activated during parasitism. nfe2l <dig> regulates many enzymes known to be involved in the detoxification of drugs and chemicals that are foreign to the body  <cit>  so we might expect to see associated pathways such as the xenobiotic metabolism signaling also being significantly regulated. nfe2l <dig> can also influence intermediary metabolism and has been show to regulate ahr , ppar, and rxr receptors that contain are  sites  <cit> . so again, is not surprising to see those pathways  being regulated and, if this is related to lipid metabolism, may explain why the nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response was regulated in siscowets and not leans.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, it appears clear from the rna-seq analysis that during lamprey parasitism, there is a very strong response in the liver that entails genes involved in the regulation of inflammation and cellular damage. in some cases it looks like genes may be stimulated as a feedback mechanism to the responses being mounted in the host. overall, the ipa analysis indicates the involvement of pathways related to 1) energy metabolism ; 2) removal and degradation of molecules arising from cellular processes such as apoptosis and oxidative stress; 3) hydromineral balance and 4) tryptophan degradation . in fact, several pathways related to tryptophan degradation were observed and we hypothesize that these are actually responses to immune reactivity brought on by the lamprey wounding and may even involve compounds produced by the parasite that are released into the host. several of these pathways including tryptophan degradation, hydromineral balance, and ubiquination were shared by both morphotypes but there were also noticeable differences particularly in pathways related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. there are very large natural differences between leans and siscowets in the levels of carbohydrate and lipid reserves and, therefore, differences observed in these metabolic pathways may depend on these energy reserves and have biological relevance in terms of how the two morphotypes cope energetically with lamprey parasitism.
