BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium that can asymptomatically colonize the intestine of humans and other mammals. it was originally identified as part of the intestinal microbiota of healthy infants  <cit> . however, when the normal flora is disturbed – for instance as a result of antibiotic treatment – c. difficile can overgrow and cause potentially fatal disease  <cit> . the main virulence factors are toxins a and b, that are encoded on a chromosomal region called the pathogenicity locus   <cit> , but other factors are also likely to play a role  <cit> . recent years have seen an increase in the incidence and severity of c. difficile infections, for reasons that are only partially understood  <cit> .

in  <dig>  the first genome sequence of a c. difficile strain was published  <cit> . this multi-resistant strain, designated  <dig>  was isolated from a patient with severe pseudomembranous colitis and caused an outbreak of diarrheal disease in a swiss hospital  <cit> . analysis of the  <dig> genome sequence revealed that approximately 11% consists of mobile genetic elements  <cit> . the majority of these elements are conjugative transposons of the tn <dig> and tn <dig> families called ctns, which have the ability to excise from their genomic target sites and transpose intra- or intercellularly  <cit> . exchange of mobile elements occurs frequently and contributes to the plasticity of the genome of c. difficile  <cit> . functions encoded on conjugative transposons can contribute to environmental adaptation and antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . in c. difficile, transfer of the conjugative elements ctn <dig>  ctn <dig>  ctn <dig>  ct <dig> and ctn <dig> from strain  <dig> into a non-toxogenic strain has been shown  <cit> . transfer of ctn <dig> , harboring a tetracycline resistance gene, has been demonstrated between species  <cit> . ctn <dig>  ctn <dig>  ctn <dig> and ctn <dig> are related to tn <dig>  based on their conjugation module  <cit> . ctn <dig> ctn <dig> and ctn <dig> are all part of the tn <dig> family, based on dna sequence homology, and their accessory modules code for uncharacterized abc-transporters  <cit> . recently it has been shown that these ctn’s may also be responsible for transfer of the paloc on large chromosomal fragments  <cit> .

after the demonstration of conjugative transfer from dna from escherichia coli to c. difficile  <cit> , genetic tools were developed for c. difficile. to facilitate the genetic manipulation, an erythromycin sensitive variant was derived from strain  <dig> by serial passaging  <cit> . this strain is particularly useful for generation of insertional mutants using clostron that employs a retrotransposition activated erythromycin resistance marker . recently, allelic exchange methods have been developed for c. difficile  <cit> . the efficiency of both methods depends on the accuracy of the genome sequence for selection of target sites and recombination events. however, no comprehensive mapping of differences between the lab- and reference strains has been published to date.

the most notable phenotypic difference between  <dig> and 630Δerm, erythromycin resistance, was found to be the result of a  <dig>  kb deletion in the mobile genetic element tn <dig> that eliminates an ermb gene  <cit> . this explains at least in part the different behavior of the two strains in a golden syrian hamster model of acute disease  <cit> , as animals are generally sensitized to c. difficile with a clindamycin treatment . at a genetic level, another difference between the two strains reported to date is a duplication in the master regulator of sporulation, spo0a, that is apparently without phenotypic consequences  <cit> .

in another gram-positive bacterium, bacillus subtilis, phenotypic differences between the ancestral strain ncib <dig> and widely used laboratory strains have been linked to specific genetic differences  <cit> . a detailed map of the genetic differences between the c. difficile strains  <dig> and 630Δerm could therefore not only facilitate genetic manipulation, but also form the basis for the investigation of phenotypic differences between these strains.

RESULTS
reference assembly of the 630Δerm genome reveals four breakpoints
we set out to investigate differences between the laboratory strain 630Δerm and reference strain  <dig> by performing short-read next generation sequencing on the illumina hiseq platform. based on the report that the erythromycin sensitivity of strain 630Δerm is due to a  <dig>  kb deletion in tn <dig>  we examined this region of the reference alignment. the analysis revealed the absence of reads mapping to the cd2007a and cd <dig> genes which are located in the expected deletion  <cit> . reads that mapped to cd <dig> /ermb1), the main erythromycin resistance determinant in strain  <dig>  <cit>  are likely due to the fact that this gene shares 100% nucleotide identity with cd <dig> /ermb), which is still present. this is supported by the observation that the coverage of both these genes is approximately 2-fold lower than the immediate surrounding regions . notably, the reference assembly failed to identify the previously identified duplication in spo0a  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

a further analysis of the reference assembly against a linearized  <dig> genome revealed four breakpoints . the first breakpoint is consistent with a deletion of ~70 bp. the remaining breakpoints are consistent with a transposition event, in which the transposed sequence is re-inserted elsewhere in the genome and in the inverse orientation compared to the reference .

de novo assembly of the 630Δerm genome using third generation sequencing
based on the identification of a potential transposition event, and our previous finding that indels may have occurred that are difficult to detect using short reads, we decided to perform an unbiased, de novo, assembly of the 630Δerm genome using single-molecule real-time sequencing. the pacific biosciences rsii system is capable of generating large reads, and with sufficient coverage, can generate high quality single contigs for bacterial genome sequences. we sequenced a genomic library of strain 630Δerm on two smrt cells, and validated the resulting single contig with a third smrt cell. the resulting genome consists of  <dig> , <dig> basepairs, with an average gc content of  <dig> % and an estimated coverage of 158× . we generated an annotated version of this genome by transferring the most recent version of the  <dig> annotation   <cit> , updating it with recent gene annotations from literature and incorporating qualifiers in the file to indicate specific features of 630Δerm. the annotated sequence has been deposited under accession number embl:ln <dig> figure  <dig>

satisfyingly, our unbiased approach identified the 18-bp duplication in the spo0a gene, encoding the master regulator of sporulation, which we previously found  <cit>  . this demonstrates that the third generation sequencing approach is superior to illumina in identifying this type of difference. in addition, we could confirm the expected  <dig>  kb deletion in tn <dig> . the sequence of tn5398∆e which we determined shows  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  compared to an in silico generated theoretical sequence of tn5398∆e   <cit> . as a result of these differences, a progressivemauve  <cit>  alignment of the tn5398Δe element from our strain with tn <dig> of strain  <dig> demonstrates the deletion of cd <dig> b), cd2009a , cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and most of cd2007a. this effectively removes the region between the two copies of ermb. the most likely scenario by which this occurred is through recombination between the two ermb genes or their immediate surrounding region; the sequence information is unable to determine the exact site of recombination, as these regions are identical, and the copies of ermb and orf <dig> in 630Δerm may therefore represent hybrids of cd2007/cd <dig> or cd2006a/cd2009a, respectively. to reflect the results of the alignment as well as the mechanism described above, we have chosen to rename the ermb gene of strain 630Δerm cd2007b/ermb  and orf <dig> as cd2006b . the resulting arrangement suggests that cd2007b is potentially expressed, as it is fused to the promoter region of cd2010/ermb <dig> at the exact same location, though the strain remains erythromycin sensitive. this discrepancy has been noted since the isolation of 630Δerm  <cit> , and cannot be resolved using the sequence information from our study.

we also identified short tandem repeats  up to 500 bp. strikingly, the genome analysis revealed two regions of high repeat density . the first region  includes the paloc that encodes toxins a and b. this region was found to be capable of transfer by a conjugation like mechanism  <cit>  and it is tempting to speculate that the high repeat density may contribute to this phenomenon. the second region  contains many genes involved in sugar metabolism, but does not seem to be associated with annotated or characterized mobile elements. large repeats  generally coincide with regions of high-gc content, and mainly reflect ribosomal gene clusters.

analysis of m6a and m4c methylation patterns of c. difficile
in bacteria, post-replicative addition of a methyl group to a base by a dna methyltransferase can result in the formation of n6-methyladenine , c5-methylcytosine  and n4-methylcytosine   <cit> . these modified bases play a role in restriction/modification systems, or may regulate cellular processes .

there is little information on methylation of chromosomal dna in c. difficile. five methylases have been identified in c. difficile  <dig>  <cit> , but in vivo methylation patterns have not been characterized. we took advantage of the pulse profiles of the pacific biosciences rsii reads that hold information about base modifications  <cit>  to generate the first comprehensive analysis of methylation patterns in c. difficile .figure  <dig>

m6a modifications can be identified with high confidence and the vast majority of the these modifications  were associated with the motif caaaaa, in which the last adenine residue is modified . previous studies identified a single methylase, m.cdi <dig>  with homology to adenine specific methylases, but failed to identify its target site in restriction protection experiments  <cit> . we postulate that cd <dig> recognizes and methylates last adenine residue the caaaaa motif and that this is possibly the only adenine-methylase in c. difficile 630Δerm.

the pulse profiles of the pacific biosciences rsii reads also identify modified cytosines. only a fraction of these are positively identified as m4c, in part due effect of modifications that are in close proximity to each other on the pulse profiles  <cit> . we did not further investigate m5c modifications, as they can only reliably be detected on the pacific biosciences platform after tet1-treatment, by preparation of shorter library fragments that are not ideal for genome de novo assembly, and with much higher coverage than obtained in our experiment  <cit> . unspecified modifications may therefore represent m4c, and possibly m5c or other modifications.

the smrt portal identified the motif gcagcagc, in which the first cytosine residue is modified, as overrepresented in the methylcytosine dataset . this motif is remarkably similar to the gcwgc motif identified for the m.cdi <dig> methylase   <cit> . we could identify  <dig> instances of m4c methylation and  <dig> of those contained the motif . when a dreme search was performed  <cit>  using 41 bp sequences centered on m4c only, a highly similar motif  was found in  <dig> instances. moreover, none of the other motifs  were specifically linked to m4c modifications, suggesting that many if not all of the m4c modifications are due to cd <dig> 

m4c and m6a methylations that were not associated with the overrepresented motifs seemed to correspond to regions of high gc-content, including the mobile elements ctn <dig>  ctn <dig> and ctn <dig> .

we also evaluated motifs previously identified as putative target sites for the other three cytosine specific methylases of c. difficile, m.cdi <dig> , m.cdi <dig>  and m.cdi <dig>   <cit> . cd <dig> conferred partial protection against digestion with bali . our data did not show any modifications on cytosine or adenine residues of this motif anywhere in the genome . considering that we cannot reliably detect m5c modifications in our setup, it is possible that m.cdi633is an m5c specific methylase. cd <dig> could confer protection against sau96i  in e. coli, but c. difficile chromosomal dna is only partially resistant to sau96i digestion  <cit> . we found only very low levels  of modified cytosines for this motif  in 630Δerm, which together with the earlier observations suggests that cd <dig> is either minor m4c or a m5c methylase. cd <dig> conferred protection against smai . we found that 6/ <dig>  of the motifs contained a modified cytosine at the third position. these modifications are likely m4c’s that cannot be positively identified as m4c due to adjacent modified bases.

c. difficile chromosomal dna is wholly resistant to tsei  and smai , though we only detected modifications for ~10% of the occurrences of these motifs. this may be due to only a fraction of the methylcytosine modifications being called by the pacific biosciences smrt platform in our analyses.

the function of the methylases of c. difficile is unknown. none seem associated with an endonuclease, indicating they are not likely to be part of a restriction-modification system. consistent with this, no effect on conjugation efficiency was observed  <cit> . cd <dig> and cd <dig> are part of prophage  <dig>  and cd <dig> is present on the ctn <dig> element, suggesting they may play a role in the biology of mobile elements.

comparison of the complete genome of 630Δerm with strain  <dig> reveals snps, indels and rearrangements
it is likely that more than the two previously identified differences  exist between strain  <dig> and strain 630Δerm. we therefore compared our de novo assembled genome to the reference sequence.

we identified  <dig> differences between the two strains. these encompass  <dig> deletions   <cit> ,  <dig> insertions   <cit> ,  <dig> insertion-deletions,  <dig> substitutions and  <dig> region of complex structural variation . of these,  <dig> were located intergenically. this includes a 102 bp deletion which likely corresponds to the breakpoint at  <dig>  mb identified in the short read next generation sequencing . a complete list of identified structural variants is available as .

 <dig> of the identified differences are associated with rrna sequences. we found that strain 630Δerm has acquired an extra ~5 kb rrna/trna cluster that is inserted between cd <dig> and cd <dig> compared to strain  <dig> . copy number variations in rrna operons have previously been noted for c. difficile  <cit>  and may reflect an adaptation to favorable growth conditions in the laboratory. similar to rrna operon  <dig>  this operon contains trnaleu and trnamet genes downstream of the 23s rrna gene, but the intergenic spacer region  between the 16s and 23s rrna genes does not contain a trnaala. a detailed comparison of the isrs of the different rrna operons is provided as additional file  <dig>  a striking number of differences were found in rrna operon  <dig> . as observed previously  <cit> , the sequence variations cluster in the 3’ region of the 16s rrna and 5’ of the 23s rrna genes.table  <dig>

we focused our further analysis on the  <dig> variants that are associated with annotated pseudogenes or open reading frames . a 24 bp deletion in cd <dig>  a conserved protein of unknown function, shortens the arginine-alanine repeat in this protein by  <dig> amino acids. in two cases, a single basepair insertion restores a pseudogene . this was confirmed by assembling the short read illumina sequences against both the  <dig> reference genome and the de novo assembled 630Δerm genome, as a variant was identified in the former but not the latter. cd <dig> encodes a putative regulatory protein with a helix-turn-helix motif and cd3156a a conserved protein of unknown function. interestingly, both proteins encoded by these genes were previously identified in a proteomic analysis  <cit> , indicating that they are expressed in strain 630Δerm. two in-frame insertions were identified . out of  <dig> identified nucleotide substitutions,  <dig> were synonymous. these include snps in the gene encoding elongation factor tu , ribosomal protein l <dig>  and the putative aminotransferase cd <dig>  strikingly, the cd <dig> gene, encoding the cell wall protein cwpv  <cit> , contains an unusually high density of mutations. in addition to the insertion and  <dig> synonymous mutations, it contains  <dig> non-synonymous but conservative mutations.

other non-synonymous mutations are located in the putative ferric uptake regulator cd <dig>  the putative acyl-coa n-acyltransferase cd <dig>  predicted glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase cd <dig> , ethanolamine utilization protein cd <dig> , the hypothetical protein cd <dig>  the phosphotransferase system protein cd <dig>  and the transcriptional regulator cd <dig>  in all these cases, the de novo assembly of the 630Δerm genome was clearly supported by the short read illumina data.

ctn <dig> is present in the ruma gene in both 630Δerm  and 630Δerm
in an attempt to visualize the proposed transposition event , we generated a dotplot of the genome sequence of our strain versus the reference . it is immediately evident that the ctn <dig> element seems to have excised from its original location in cd <dig>  and has inserted in an inverted manner in ruma  in our isolate of 630Δerm, for clarity hereafter referred to as 630Δerm.figure  <dig>

to exclude that the finding represents a misassembly in the original  <dig> genome sequence, and confirm the presence of ctn <dig> in ruma in 630Δerm , we performed various control pcrs . in strain  <dig>  we found ctn <dig> inserted in cd <dig> and confirmed an intact ruma gene. in contrast, in 630Δerm , we detected no product for the left and right junctions of ctn <dig> in cd1844/cd1878a, indicating that the element is not present at this location. we readily amplified fragments corresponding to the left and right junction of ctn <dig> when inserted in ruma in c. difficile 630Δerm, but not  <dig>  chromosomal dna. interestingly, we observed a faint band corresponding to intact ruma even in strain 630Δerm . this indicates that a subpopulation of cells does not contain ctn <dig> at this location, either because it has not inserted yet, or retains the ability to excise spontaneously as previously observed for  <dig>  <cit> .

the ctn <dig> insertion site identified here is located immediately downstream of ctn <dig>  a similar tandem arrangement has previously been observed in two clinical pcr ribotype  <dig> isolates  <cit> . in another clinical isolate , which lacked a ctn7-like element, a ctn5-like element was found to be integrated at a site homologous to the target site of ctn <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> .

the annotation of cd <dig> as ruma in c. difficile is based on homology of the predicted protein to e. coli ruma . this enzyme methylates a uracil nucleotide of the ribosomal rna  <cit> . e. coli ruma mutants perform similarly compared with the wild type strain, in terms of cell growth, antibiotic resistance, and fidelity of translation. however, Δruma cells are outcompeted by wild type cells in growth competition assays, which may imply that ribosome function is moderately affected  <cit> .

the translocation of ctn <dig> to ruma has two major consequences. first, the cd <dig> gene, encoding a putative adhesin is restored. second, the ruma open reading frame is fused to the cd1844a open reading frame resulting into a hybrid protein . cd1844a shows very high similarity  to the c-terminus of an enterococcus faecalis ruma homolog . however, the homology of c. difficile ruma to this gene is limited to the n-terminal trma-like domain  . thus, a link between these open reading frames is also found in other organisms than c. difficile. in order to determine what the phenotypic consequences are of the transposition of ctn <dig> further experiments are required.

to further our understanding of the origin of the transposition event, we compared the location of ctn <dig> by pcr in different related strains; a non-passaged isolate of the original 630Δerm  <cit> , hereafter referred to as 630Δerm , and another erythromycin sensitive derivative of  <dig>  630e/jir <dig>  <cit> . we found that in strain 630e the element is present in cd1844/cd1878a, identical to the reference strain, suggesting that the transposition event is not linked to the loss of erythromycin resistance. the 630Δerm  strain shows prominent bands corresponding to ctn <dig> at its cd1844/cd1878a location, but also a weak signal for ctn <dig> at ruma . therefore, this isolate likely contains a subpopulation of cells with the transposition identified in this study. it is possible that ctn <dig> is stable at either location and the stock of the 630Δerm  is non-clonal, or that ctn <dig> in 630Δerm  is highly mobile. during redistribution of the strain, isolates with either insertion could have been selected.

in summary, our data show that integration of ctn <dig> can occur in at least two different sites in the c. difficile 630Δerm genome, and that the element can switch between these locations during repeated passaging.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here provides the first reference genome for the widely used c. difficile laboratory strain 630Δerm, including the first analysis of major methylation patterns for any c. difficile strain. our work reveals that in addition to insertion, deletions and snps, the ctn <dig> element has moved from its original location within cd <dig> to the ruma gene in our isolate. the observation of such a dramatic rearrangement has important implications for the redistribution of strains with highly mobile genomes and argues for complete resequencing of common lab strains in each laboratory.
