BACKGROUND
soybean  merr.) seed is one of the most important agricultural commodities produced worldwide, generating oils, proteins, and carbohydrates  <cit> . final seed composition is influenced by both the genotype and environmental factors . breeding programs endeavor to improve the functional properties, and hence the economic value of soybean by reducing anti-nutritive seed components such as phytic acid. phytic acid , a major source of phosphorus in seeds, can cause problems such as poor mineral bioavailability and phosphate pollution  <cit> . low pa  crops are therefore highly desirable for reducing anti-nutritional and environmental effects of conventional crops . the lpa soybean line ‘v99-5089’ carries a non-lethal, recessive mutation in the myo-inositol phosphate synthase   <dig> gene, whereas ‘cx-1834’ carries mutations in two multidrug resistant protein  genes, encoding atp-binding cassette transporters . the mips <dig> gene, expressed during seed development in soybean, is associated with the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to myo-inositol-3-monophosphate, which is the first step in pa biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . loss of function mutation in this gene disrupts this pathway. the mrp genes are also highly expressed in developing embryos, however, the mechanism by which they regulate pa levels in soybean is poorly understood  <cit> .

the pa biosynthesis pathway plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis. several pathway intermediates, such as myo-inositol- <dig> ,5-trisphosphate, act as secondary messengers in signal transduction and are known to regulate growth and developmental processes, including phosphorus and mineral storage, dna repair, chromatin remodeling, rna editing and export, atp generation, regulation of gene expression, regulation of guard cells, auxin metabolism and cell-wall polysaccharide biosynthesis . numerous studies have reported the effects of lpa on plant growth and development. an rnai-mediated mips <dig> knockdown in soybean was reported to inhibit seed development along with reduced pa content  <cit> . similarly, seed embryo defects were reported for arabidopsis and common bean  mips mutants  <cit> . the mips mutation regulates raffinose family oligosaccharide pathway, and mutants exhibit impaired pathogen resistance, programmed cell death in leaves, and polar auxin transport causing deformed cotyledon development . the mrp mutants are known to exhibit lpa phenotypes in soybean, rice, maize, and arabidopsis  <cit> . mrp knockout studies in arabidopsis exhibit phenotypes such as insensitivity to abscisic acid-mediated germination and unresponsive stomata opening, resulting in reduced transpiration rate and increased drought tolerance; which were rescued by mrp overexpression  <cit> . finally, lpa crops are known to show poor seedling emergence, resulting in reduced crop yield, which decreases the agronomic value of lpa crops .

despite these diverse physiological responses of different lpa mutations, very little is known about the effect of combining lpa mutations together on seed development and the underlying regulation of gene expression in soybean. bowen et al.  <cit>  investigated microarray-based gene expression changes in developing embryos of barley lpa mutant. this study identified several differentially expressed genes associated with different cellular processes, such as carbohydrate metabolism, hormonal signaling and transport  <cit> . recent developments in sequencing technologies have enhanced the scope of genome-wide gene expression studies to a level far beyond microarray. an advanced generation recombinant inbred line  3mlpa with three lpa-causing mutations, derived from a bi-parental cross of v99- <dig> and cx- <dig>  provides a higher reduction in pa content of soybean seed relative to those with single mutations  <cit> . the 3mlpa triple mutant line and another advanced generation ril 3mwt without any lpa-causing mutations, derived from the same cross  are unique genetic materials for gene expression studies. in this report, we used mrna-sequencing  to study the effect of lpa-causing mutations from mips <dig> and mrp genes on global changes in gene expression profiles of developing soybean seeds. a total of  <dig> transcriptome datasets derived from five developing seed stages with three biological replicates each of 3mlpa and 3mwt soybean line were sequenced and analyzed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive report describing the gene regulatory effect of mips <dig> and mrp mutations together. the significantly enriched biological processes and transcription factors identified in this study further our understanding of seed development lpa mutants.table  <dig> characteristics of experimental lines and their parents

RESULTS
differential expression analyses
whole soybean seeds comprised of cotyledons, endosperm, and seed coat, were sampled in triplicate from 3mlpa and 3mwt lines at five stages of seed development . these stages were chosen to correspond to seed filling stages post embryo development and before desiccation  <cit> . more than  <dig> million sequencing reads were obtained from  <dig> mrna libraries, and  <dig>  %  of the reads were mapped to the annotated soybean reference, williams  <dig> genome assembly  <dig>  sequence . read counts  were estimated from the sequence mapping data for all the annotated gene models  of williams  <dig> genome . normalized read count data were used for differential expression analyses. principal component analysis  and sample-to-sample distance clustering variance stabilized log <dig> transformed normalized read count data for all genes from  <dig> sample libraries, are shown in fig.  <dig>  sample libraries generated from different seed developmental stages were distinctly represented along pc <dig>  in a unidirectional pattern starting from stage  <dig> to  <dig> in pca; whereas those generated from the 3mlpa line were clearly differentiated from their respective 3mwt libraries along pc <dig> . this means that first and second major contributors to variation in the data are seed developmental stages and genotypes, respectively. at the same time, the biological replicates of each stage clustered together, suggesting minimal variance between replicates. similarities and dissimilarities between individual sample libraries were visualized using heatmap of sample-to-sample distance clustering as shown in fig. 3b. the sample libraries from early  and late  seed development stages were dissimilar to each other, while those from stage  <dig> are partially similar to both groups.fig.  <dig> seed developmental stages for sampling. three biological replicates sampled per stage for both 3mlpa and 3mwt

we identified a total of  <dig>  genes with significant differential expression between the 3mlpa and 3mwt lines at five seed developmental stages . some of these degs may be due to non-isogenic background of the experimental lines. of these differentially expressed genes ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were identified as up- and down-regulated in the 3mlpa line. about  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were expressed only in either 3mlpa line or 3mwt, respectively . several genes were differentially expressed in more than one stage, and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between 3mlpa versus 3mwt in all five stages of seed development .table  <dig> differential gene expression between 3mlpa and 3mwt

functional enrichment analyses
functional enrichment of gene ontology  and transcription factor  families employing degs for each stage was performed using a statistical hyper-geometric test employing the benjamini-hochberg method for multiple testing to obtain adjusted-p-values. the enriched results were then filtered using adjusted-p-value < = <dig>   to obtain highly significant enriched terms. table  <dig> shows highly significant enriched go terms identified at five seed developmental stages. although some terms were found in more than one stage or were stage-specific, none were common in all five stages. in order to simplify the interpretations, we grouped the stages into early  and late phase  of seed development. enriched go terms from stage  <dig>  showed partial overlap with both early and late phases. most of the degs associated with significantly enriched biological processes in early phase of seed development were up-regulated, whereas those in late phase were down-regulated in 3mlpa line.table  <dig> enriched gene ontology terms associated with biological processes

hierarchical clustering of mean normalized gene expression levels of degs associated with the enriched biological processes of cellular glucan metabolism, apoptosis, cellular transport, photosynthesis and glycolysis is shown in fig.  <dig>  the biological processes of cellular glucan metabolism, apoptosis and cellular transport were up-regulated in early stages , while those associated with photosynthesis and glycolysis were down-regulated in late stages  of 3mlpa line. the relative gene expression data from rna-seq analysis for two randomly selected degs  were evaluated using qpcr . the genes cesa and sugt <dig> are associated with cellular glucan metabolism and cellular transport respectively. the rna-seq analysis showed up-regulation of cesa and sugt <dig> genes in 3mlpa in early stages of seed development. both real time quantification and rna-seq analysis showed similar expression pattern for the cesa and sugt <dig> genes. there was no significant difference in the gene expression data obtained from qpcr and rna-seq analyses at the  <dig>  significance level. we also tested relative expression of mips <dig>  mrp-l and mrp-n genes, which were not differentially expressed in any of our seed stages. both qpcr and rna-seq analyses estimated similar fold change expression with no significant difference between them .fig.  <dig> mean normalized gene expression profiles of degs associated with biological processes  cellular glucan metabolic process,  apoptosis,  oligopeptide transporters,  transmembrane transporters,  photosynthesis, and  glycolysis. hierarchical clustering of mean normalized gene expression values based on euclidean distance between seed developmental stages of 3mlpa and 3mwt. rows represent genes, while columns represent samples. green color indicates higher gene expression values

soybean genome assembly  <dig> is annotated to contain  <dig> tf genes from  <dig> tf families  <cit> . total of  <dig> differentially expressed tf genes were identified in this study. these genes belonged to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> different tf families in seed developmental stages  <dig> to  <dig> respectively. tf family enrichment analysis resulted in identification of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tf families significantly enriched in seed developmental stages  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively . we observed tf families gras , wrky, zf-hd , and zim  were enriched in early stages , whereas, families camta , grf , mbf <dig> , snf <dig>  and tcp  were enriched in later stages  of seed development. among these enriched tf families, tcp family was represented in stages  <dig> and  <dig>  while camta was represented in stages 3– <dig>  all together, these tf families represented  <dig> unique degs. the genes belonging to enriched tf families, such as wrky, gras, zim, camta, grf, and snf <dig>  were up-regulated, whereas, those belonging to zf-hd, mbf1b, and tcp were down-regulated in the 3mlpa mutant.table  <dig> transcription factor families significantly enriched in developing seed stages



regulation of defense response in early seed development of 3mlpa mutant
‘apoptosis’  and ‘innate immune response’  were enriched in early phases of seed development, particularly in stages 1– <dig> and stage  <dig> respectively, with different sets of degs identified for these stages . while several of these genes are shared between these two categories, a total of  <dig> degs were associated with both. forty-seven of these genes  were up-regulated and  <dig>  genes were down-regulated in the 3mlpa mutant line. the fc and log2fc ratio of apoptosis-related differentially expressed genes are reported in additional file  <dig>  these defense-related degs encoded  lrr  domain-containing disease resistance proteins,  nb-arc  domain-containing disease resistance proteins,  bcl-2-associated athanogene  <dig>   adr1-l <dig> ,  cysteine proteinases,  protein kinase and  ntp hydrolases. apoptosis is a common phenotype observed in mips <dig> mutants of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .

the defense-related genes identified in this study lie upstream of the apoptotic processes. for example, the lrr and nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance genes are involved in initiating the defense response via induction of salicylic acid  and formation of reactive oxygen species , both of which ultimately leading to cell death. arabidopsis thaliana mips <dig> mutants were shown to accumulate sa and ceramide, both associated with formation of a cell death lesion area, with the phenotype rescued by treating with either myo-inositol or galactinol  <cit> . apoptosis in mips <dig> mutants is also regulated by light intensity and ros such as peroxisomal hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide anion  <cit> . myo-inositol mitigates sa-dependent apoptosis and defense responses  <cit> . although apoptosis is associated with mips <dig> mutation and not with mrp mutation, induction of the defense-related genes in 3mlpa may not be solely due to mips <dig> mutation. the adr1-l <dig> genes , which belong to a subgroup of cnl-a clade of coiled-coil nbs-lrr gene family, showed two-fold higher expression in 3mlpa mutant  <cit> . the adr <dig> genes are positive regulators of sa-mediated cell death and defense response  <cit> . enhanced expression of adr <dig> gene was previously shown to establish drought tolerance in presence of sa  <cit> . and interestingly, the mrp <dig> mutants of arabidopsis are also known to be drought tolerant  <cit> . role of mrp genes in regulating defense responses is still unknown, and further studies are required to confirm the association of the drought tolerant phenotype of the mrp mutants and up regulation of adr <dig> genes as in 3mlpa. in addition, several wrky transcription factor family genes that regulate expression of other defense-related genes were also up-regulated in early stages of seed development in 3mlpa mutant. in summary, the lpa-causing mutations in 3mlpa mutant may play a role in initiating defense responses during seed development.

regulation of photosynthesis in late stages of seed development in 3mlpa mutant
‘photosynthesis’  was enriched in late phase  of seed development, with most of the photosynthesis-related degs from these stages were down-regulated in 3mlpa mutant . fifty-six degs were associated with photosynthesis and of these only one gene  was up-regulated in 3mlpa mutant. these degs genes encode different subunits in photosystem  i , and ps ii , light-harvesting chlorophyll complex proteins from ps i  and ps ii , and a single gene encoding for magnesium protoporphyrin ix methyl transferase  . a previous study on transcriptome profiles of soybean cultivar ‘williams’ reported expression of photosynthesis-related genes early in development when seed size was 25–50 mg  <cit> . this would correspond to stages 2– <dig> in our investigation. bowen et al.  <cit>  previously reported two photosynthesis related probesets that were differentially expressed in m <dig> maize line with lpa at 7 days post anthesis. one representing chloroplast nucleoid dna binding protein was down-regulated, while another representing early light inducing protein, was up-regulated in m <dig> line  <cit> . although these proteins were not identified in our study, regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in lpa mutants is a common observation.

the psi and psii protein complexes are involved in capturing light energy during photosynthesis. differential expression of these genes may translate into different numbers of psi and psii protein complexes between 3mlpa and 3mwt. the methyl transferase chlm is involved in chlorophyll metabolism where it catalyzes the formation of mg-protoporphyrin ix monomethyl ester  <cit> . bruggeman et al.  <cit>  have reviewed the association of chloroplast activity with the formation of cell death lesions, where excess light energy can trigger cell death. down regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in 3mlpa may prevent apoptosis by limiting the light energy during late stages of seed development. cell death lesion formation in mips <dig> arabidopsis mutants is dependent on light intensity and ros accumulation  <cit> , and abolishing psii assembly was shown to reduce cell death lesions  <cit> . tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is also regulated to prevent accumulation of ros, which can also lead to cell death  <cit> . moreover, we also identified enhanced expression of camta3/signal responsive  <dig>  tf genes in 3mlpa during late stages of seed development. camta3/sr <dig> is a negative regulator of sa-mediated plant immunity and it inhibits cell death  <cit> . therefore, these observations strongly suggest that the up-regulation of cell death inducing genes in early stages of seed development in 3mlpa mutant is suppressed in late stages. myo-inositol promotes photosynthesis in mesembryanthemum crystallinum so another explanation for down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in 3mlpa mutant may be the mips <dig> mutation, which reduces myo-inositol levels  <cit> .

regulation of glucan metabolism in early seed development of 3mlpa mutant
cellular glucan metabolic process  was found enriched in both stage  <dig> and  <dig> , however the degs associated with this process were stage-dependent . twenty-seven genes were up-regulated, and two genes  were down-regulated in 3mlpa mutant. six genes were differentially expressed in both stages and all were up-regulated in 3mlpa mutant. the fc of up-regulated genes ranged between  <dig> – <dig> and  <dig> – <dig> for stages  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in case of down-regulated genes, the fc was between  <dig> – <dig>  for stages  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. two genes  showed no expression or zero read count in 3mwt resulting in infinite  value for fc and log <dig> fc ratio. the differentially expressed genes associated with this process encoded two enzymes:  cellulose synthase ; and  xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase . functional enrichment also showed over-representation of genes associated with xet enzymatic activity . the cesa and xet enzymes are involved in synthesis of building units of cell wall, i.e. cellulose, and xyloglucan  chains, respectively. cellulose synthase activity is an integral component of cell wall synthesis. a previous study on transcriptome profiles of soybean line ‘a81-356022’ reported higher cellulose synthase activity in developing seeds at 25– <dig> days post flowering  <cit> . differential expression of the cesa and xet genes in early seed development suggests regulation of cell wall synthesis in 3mlpa mutant line. role of myo-inositol in cell wall synthesis via the myo-inositol oxidation pathway, resulting in formation precursors of pectin and hemicellulose, is well established and regulation of cell wall biosynthesis in mips mutants is therefore expected  <cit> . the contribution of either the mips or mrp mutations towards this response lies out of scope of this experiment, however, it is possible that 3mlpa mutants initiate formation of cell wall polysaccharides at earlier stages of development relative to the non-mutants.

regulation of cellular transport in early seed development of 3mlpa mutant
processes involving oligo-peptide transporters  and transmembrane  transporters were enriched in stage  <dig> . although several transporter genes were differentially expressed in other stages, the go term associated with the transporter activity was not significantly enriched in those stages. together, oligo-peptide and transmembrane transport activity were associated with a total of  <dig> unique differentially expressed genes and 86 % of these genes were found up-regulated in the mutant line. twenty-nine  of these up-regulated genes encode for multidrug transporters, including  <dig> from major facilitator superfamily , six from multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  efflux carrier superfamily, five from multidrug resistance superfamily, two genes for p-glycoprotein  and  <dig> gene for atp binding cassette  subfamily  . most of the multidrug transporters are annotated as being involved in removal of toxic compounds from the cell  <cit> . recently, a mfs transporter, zinc-induced facilitator-like  <dig> from arabidopsis was reported to be associated with polar auxin transport in roots, as well as regulation of stomata for drought stress tolerance  <cit> . the abc b <dig> transporters are also involved in auxin-gradient dependent polar auxin transport in root  <cit> , and pgp transporters are involved in cellular and long distance transport of auxin  <cit> . defects in mips mutant embryos were previously associated with impaired endomembrane system and lack of polar auxin transport  <cit> . the genes encoding monosaccharide transporters such as sugar transport protein, inositol transporter and polyol/monosaccharide transporter were also differentially expressed in our dataset. these genes are involved in transport of sugars such as glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, xylose, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, and epimers and derivatives of myo-inositol  <cit> . other genes encoding transporters/carriers of cationic amino acids, oligopeptides, potassium, sulfate, nitrates, zinc, chloride and dicarboxylate ions were also identified in 3mlpa mutant line. although substrates of mrp-l and mrp-n transporters are still unknown, enrichment of the transporter genes may be compensating for the loss of mrp-l and mrp-n.

regulation of raffinose family oligosaccharide biosynthesis in developing seeds of 3mlpa mutant
the raffinose family oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose are considered to be anti-nutritive components in seeds  <cit> . the biosynthesis of raffinose family oligosaccharide  involves three steps:  galactinol synthase  catalyzes the formation of galactinol from myo-inositol and udp-galactose,  raffinose synthase  catalyzes the formation of raffinose by adding sucrose to galactinol and releasing a myo-inositol molecule, and  stachyose synthase  catalyzes the formation of stachyose by adding galactinol to raffinose and releasing myo-inositol . the mips <dig> mutation is associated with low stachyose phenotype in the parental line v99- <dig>  <cit> . however, the 3mlpa mutant shows normal stachyose levels in mature seeds despite having mips <dig> mutation  <cit> . the genes encoding rfo biosynthesis pathway enzymes are expressed in seed filling and dessication stages of soybean seed development  <cit> . none of these genes showed significant differential expression at 1 % fdr, which may be one possible explanation for normal stachyose phenotype in 3mlpa mutant. figure  <dig> represents rfos biosynthesis pathway, and the relative gene expression values for selected genes in the pathway.fig.  <dig> raffinose family oligosaccharide biosynthesis pathway. bar graphs indicate fold change  ratio of normalized expression values for genes  galactinol synthase,  raffinose synthase and  stachyose synthase at  <dig> stages of seed development. green and orange bars indicate mean fold change values from rna-seq and qpcr experiments, respectively. gene expression profiles showing significant difference between qpcr and rna-seq analyses are indicated by asterisk  



there are six genes  annotated as gs in first assembly of reference soybean genome . the glyma19g <dig> gene showed highest-fc in rna-seq experiment, so we estimated relative expression for this gs gene using qpcr. the relative transcript levels of gs gene showed a gradual increase in 3mlpa during seed development . rna-seq data showed similar gradual increase in expression in 3mlpa during seed development, but expression dropped at stage  <dig> . glyma06g <dig> encodes rs  is expressed during seed development in williams  <dig> soybean line, and is known to control the raffinose and stachyose content in soybean seeds  <cit> . the relative transcript levels of the rs gene showed more than 2-fold change in 3mlpa in late phase  of seed development, with no difference between the stages 3– <dig> . the fold change of rs remained below  <dig> in 3mlpa during early stages. this validates the rna-seq data except for stage  <dig>  where fold change of rs was close to  <dig> in 3mlpa . glyma19g <dig> is the only ss encoding gene in glyma.wm <dig> a <dig> . at stage  <dig> and  <dig>  ss gene showed significant difference in the fold change obtained from qpcr and rna-seq analyses. the relative transcript levels of the ss gene showed almost no change between 3mlpa and 3mwt with fold change below  <dig> . it is possible that mechanisms other than differential expression are involved in regulation of rfo biosynthesis pathway, which does not allow us to elaborate further on these observations.

CONCLUSIONS
the pa biosynthesis pathway intermediates are involved in many growth and developmental processes. several genes encoding key enzymes regulating this pathway are mutated to obtain lpa crops. we used a transcriptomics approach to compare the gene expression profiles of a lpa soybean line  carrying three  mutations and a non-mutant line, 3mwt, at  <dig> stages of soybean seed development. the differential expression and functional enrichment analyses indicated regulation of biological processes such as glucan synthesis, cell death and photosynthesis. we also identified regulated transcription factor families, including wrky, camta, gras and zim. these results delineate the metabolic events associated with regulation of the pa biosynthetic pathway in the presence of lpa-causing mutations. we also quantified transcript levels of genes involved in the raffinose family oligosaccharides pathway in 3mlpa mutant. overall, these results contribute to an understanding of regulation of metabolism in 3mlpa mutant during seed development.
