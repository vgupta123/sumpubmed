BACKGROUND
the paracoccidioides genus comprises a complex of pathogenic fungi, classified in at least four distinct phylogenetic lineages: s <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig> and pb01-like  <cit> . these fungi are thermally dimorphic, growing at room temperatures as mycelium, which produces infectious conidia. the inhalation of conidia or mycelia propagules by the human host and their differentiation to yeast cells initiates paracoccidioidomycosis , a major health problem in south america. this human systemic mycosis is considered the tenth leading cause of chronic disease mortality among infectious and parasitic diseases, and the first among the systemic mycoses in brazil   <cit> .

pathogenic microorganisms are able to penetrate and colonize host tissues by establishing complex interactions with the host molecules. some microorganisms degrade extracellular matrix components  by using proteins that subvert proteases of the host itself  <cit> . reports have shown that pathogens can capture plasminogen  and its activation could substantially augment the organism’s potential to tissue invasion and necrosis  <cit> . in eukaryotes, plg is converted to its proteolytic form, plasmin, by physiological activators such as tissue type plasminogen activator  and urokinase type   <cit> . plasmin dissociates blood clots due to its role in the degradation of fibrin polymers and promotes the dissociation of the ecm components, which is relevant for dissemination of pathogens  <cit> .

there is a variety of plg-binding proteins and activation mechanisms used by pathogens. besides the physiological activators, molecules produced by microorganisms, can also activate plasminogen. studies describe various plg-binding and activating proteins involved in the degradation of host tissues, components of ecm, which favors the spread and dissemination of different pathogens  <cit> . in bacteria, plg-binding and activating proteins have been characterized  <cit> . those proteins can increase the bacteria fibrinolytic activity, which favors tissue degradation and rapid progression of infection  <cit> . the importance of plg in fungi is indicated by the plg-binding properties of human pathogens, including candida albicans  <cit> , cryptococcus neoformans  <cit> , pneumocystis carinii and aspergillus fumigatus  <cit>  that depict proteins at surface, which make them able to bind plg, and improve ther infectiveness.

the high dissemination of paracoccidioides spp. from the site of infection to different tissues, underscores the importance of understanding the fungi virulence factors and their effects in human host. in a previous study developed by our group, we reported the recruitment of plg and its activation into plasmin, by paracoccidioides, pb <dig>  through tpa, in a process mediated by the protein enolase  <cit> . the enolase of paracoccidioides is a surface associated protein that promotes an increase in the adhesion and invasion of the fungus to host cells in in vitro models of infection  <cit> . the recombinant paracoccidioides enolase is able to adhere to some ecm components and to the surface of macrophages, reinforcing the role of this molecule in the host-pathogen interaction  <cit> . these data highlight that plg-binding proteins increase the potential for invasion and pathogenicity of paracoccidioides through the fibrinolytic activity of plasmin. proteins with this ability may be transported to the surface of the fungus and secreted into the external medium and promote plasmin formation, which also contributes to the pathogen dissemination  <cit> . in this sense, the enolase of paracoccidioides is constitutively secreted by the yeast and mycelia phases  <cit> , and is detected in the fungal cell wall  <cit> .

in the present study, we employed proteomic analysis of the secretome, in order to identify plg-binding proteins of paracoccidioides, pb <dig>  fifteen plg-binding proteins were present in the fungal secretome. proteins of the glycolytic pathway, such as phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase  were identified; the last was selected for further characterization. fba has been described in various microorganisms as a plg-binding protein, but its role has not been described in thermally dimorphic fungi. here we show that paracoccidioides binds plg via fba, that is found at the surface and secreted by the fungus. the protein binds human plasminogen  and converts it into plasmin, in the presence of tpa. the interaction of the protein with hplg, promoted increased fibrinolytic capacity of the fungus, as tested in fibrin degradation assays. the addition of recombinant fba  or anti-rfba antibodies was capable of reducing the interaction between macrophages and paracoccidioides, possibly by blocking the binding sites for fba. these data reveal the possible participation of the fba in the paracoccidioides adhesion and invasion processes. the identification of novel surface/secreted proteins that can be involved in host-pathogen interaction is central to understand paracoccidioides pathogenesis.

RESULTS

the detected spots in the membrane  were compared to the coomassie blue partners in order to find their corresponding proteins spots in the 2-de gel . subsequently, protein spots were manually excised of the gel, and identified by mass spectrometry. it was possible to identify in the secretome of yeast cells,  <dig> protein spots, which bound plg, as depicted in figure 1b. figure  <dig>  panel c, depicts the images of the negative control assay, in which the membrane was not previously incubated with plg, indicating no cross-reactivity of the proteins with the antibody to plg.

while much of the proteins described in this work are not annotated in the database psort  as extracellular proteins, we found compatible data in other studies. the proteins: 2-methylcitrate synthase, fba, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, formamidase, acetyl-coa acetyltransferase and phosphoglycerate kinase were detected in the secretome of paracoccidioides, pb <dig> yeast and mycelia  <cit> . other proteins were identified in the secretome of paracoccidioides, pb18: fba, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase  <cit> . these data corroborate the in silico analysis performed in the software signal p and secretome p, where we can observe that most of the proteins described here are secreted by nonclassical pathways .

some of the proteins identified in this study have also been described in other systems as plg-binding proteins. in this way, acetyl-coa acetyltransferase was identified in the bacteria leptospira interrogans  <cit> ; phosphoglycerate kinase was described in c. albicans  <cit> , streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> , as well as in c. neoformans  <cit> . in addition, fba and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also described as plg-binding proteins in c. albicans  <cit> .

formamidase is a highly abundant protein in paracoccidioides, as previously described by our group  <cit> . the protein gp <dig> also detected in our binding assays, binds to laminin, putatively contributing to the fungus virulence and facilitating the process of infection  <cit> .

the proteomic binding assays, also allowed the identification of enolase as a plg-binding protein. the presence of glycolytic enzymes as plg-binding proteins is reported in several pathogens, including bacteria and fungi. in paracoccidioides, enolase is present at the yeast cells surface, where it binds and activates hplg, presumably contributing to the fungus pathogenesis  <cit> . other glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase and fba, were found here as plg-binding proteins . glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , is a molecule that binds plg and is present on the surface and secretome of bacteria  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> . in c. albicans, this molecule is an adhesin that participates in the process of adherence to human cells, and binds to ecm components  <cit> . in studies conducted by our group, gapdh is located at the surface of paracoccidioides, where could mediate the adhesion and internalization of the fungus to host cells, binding to ecm components  <cit> .

phosphoglycerate kinase is an adhesin in both, bacteria  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> . on the surface of group b streptococcus, phosphoglycerate kinase binds the host actin and plg. binding of ecm components to bacterial proteins, including phosphoglycerate kinase, promotes the activation of specific proteins on its surface, which induces bacterial adhesion  <cit> . also, proteolytic degradation of ecm by phosphoglycerate kinase - recruited plasmin activity, promotes adherence to endothelial cells and bacterial dissemination in the host tissues  <cit> . in c. neoformans, phosphoglycerate kinase localizes to the fungal cell wall, where exhibits accessible carboxyl-terminal lysine residues for plg-binding  <cit> .

fba is cytoplasmic and also localized at the surface of several bacteria  <cit> , as well as in pathogenic fungi  <cit>  where it binds host molecules and depicts adhesin function, beyond its glycolytic activity. in this work, three isoforms of fba were detected . the fba of paracoccidioides, pb <dig> was previously characterized in our laboratory  <cit> . the protein is as an antigenic molecule, reactive with sera of pcm patients, as demonstrated  <cit> . studies revealed the role of fba in cell adhesion and invasion  <cit> . the fba-deficient mutant of neisseria meningitides was not affected in its ability to grow in vitro, but depicted a significant reduction in adhesion to human brain microvascular endothelial and hep- <dig> cells, suggesting participation in adhesion of meningococci to human cells  <cit> . in c. neoformans, analysis of the plg-binding proteins, allowed the identification of a fba surface protein, that serves as a plg receptor  <cit> . so, due to the relevance of fba as an adhesin and a plg-binding protein that promotes the virulence of microorganisms, the protein was selected for further investigation in paracoccidioides.

confirmatory assays of fba as a plasminogen-binding protein
we selected fba for further analysis, since the protein is a plg-binding protein in several pathogens, as previously described  <cit> . to verify if the fba of paracoccidioides also has this ability, a recombinant protein was obtained by cloning the cdna  into the expression vector pgex-4 t- <dig>  as described in material and methods. the fusion protein was obtained in e. coli. as observed in figure 2a, the recombinant protein was purified  and cleaved from the fusion with gst by the addition of thrombin, rendering a 40-kda protein . a far-western blotting with increasing concentrations of rfba was obtained, and depicted in figure 2b. concentrations of  <dig>  μg to 3 μg of the recombinant protein were subjected to far-western, demonstrating a dose-dependent binding of the protein with plg, showing that, in fact, the fba of paracoccidioides binds to the plg.figure  <dig>

detection of fba at the paracoccidioides surface
in order to determine the localization of the fba in paracoccidioides, pb <dig>  we performed a western blotting with cellular fractions of paracoccidioides and polyclonal antibodies raised in mice to the recombinant protein. as shown in figure 3a, the fba is present in the cytoplasm, secretome and cell wall . the fraction  <dig> contains proteins associated with the cell surface by non-covalent bonds or by disulfide bridges, as described  <cit> . the fraction  <dig> represents cell wall proteins sensitive to treatment with alkali , including cell wall proteins with internal repeats . fraction  <dig> represents proteins with glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchors linked to the wall   <cit> , but rfba was not detected in this fraction. furthermore, the immunoelectron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of fba in the cytoplasm, in vesicles in releasing process and at the cell surface, as depicted in figure 3b, panel  <dig>  the release of vesicles to the external environment is used by many pathogens to increase their invasive potential. vesicles contain many virulence factors, including molecules that bind to and activate plg  <cit> . the presence of fba at the surface and vesicle of the fungus can allow the capture of hplg and plasmin generation, forming a highly fibrinolytic layer around the fungal cell. these data suggest that fba, can somehow influence fibrinolytic activity of yeast cells. cell wall and secreted proteins, may participate in the process.figure  <dig>

paracoccidioides and rfba bind and activate plasminogen, promoting fibrinolytic activity
we next investigated whether the capture of plg by fba, favors the generation of plasmin. previous work from our group have demonstrated that yeast cells of paracoccidioides bind to plg  <cit> . as described in materials and methods the test was performed by fixation of yeast cells or the rfba, followed by incubations with hplg and tpa. in the presence of tpa, the yeast cells and the rfba were able to generate plasmin. this ability was inhibited by the lysine analogue , which competes for the binding sites of plg . competition experiments were developed by adding increasing concentrations of εaca, which inhibits plasmin generation in a dose dependent manner . these data suggest that yeast cells, as well as the recombinant protein bind hplg, converting into plasmin in the presence of tpa.figure  <dig> 
plasminogen-binding and activation and fibrin degradation assays. 
paracoccidioides yeast cells and the rfba were incubated with hplg in the presence or absence of tpa and εaca. we used a plasmin substrate   to dose the amidolytic activity of the reaction of converting plasminogen into plasmin.  in competition experiments we added to the wells increasing concentrations of εaca , followed by the addition of hplg. experiments were performed in triplicate as described in materials and methods. the error bars indicate the standard deviations between the results. *: results significantly different from control, at a p value <  <dig> .  the fibrinolytic activity of paracoccidioides was analysed by the observation of clear hydrolysis haloes within the opaque jellified-fibrin-containing matrix. panel 1: paracoccidioides yeast cells in the absence of hplg; 2: the fungus after binding to hplg; 3: similar to  <dig> and  <dig>  but reflecting the presence of tpa. the fungus was incubated in the presence of hplg and tpa, with the addition of anti-rfba  and proteases inhibitors, aprotinin and pmsf . controls consisting of plasminogen and tpa .



fibrinogen is a major substrate of plasmin in vivo and for that, we examined plasmin activity in jellified matrices containing fibrinogen . fibrin degradation tests were performed in triplicate , where yeast cells were incubated in the presence of hplg and tpa. it was observed the formation of hydrolysis haloes within the jellified-fibrin-containing matrix . in an attempt to block the receptor of plasminogen on the surface of the fungus, yeast cells were incubated with anti-rfba polyclonal antibodies . a decrease in the hydrolysis halo comparing the panels  <dig> to  <dig>  can be observed. the addition of protease inhibitors resulted in no halo formation, due to inactivation of plasmin activity . negative controls are presented in panels  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas positive control is presented in panel  <dig>  thus, we can conclude that fba of paracoccidioides may have an important role in the host tissues invasion by the fungus, besides participating in metabolic processes. corroborating other studies on this subject, the secondary role of this protein makes it an important virulence factor. by capturing and activating plg, fba can promote the spread of the fungus, certainly by matrix degradation, paving the way for infection toward internal organs.

rfba influences the interaction of paracoccidioides with macrophages
the rfba of paracoccidioides behaved as an adhesin in a binding assay between j <dig> and rfba. macrophages were able to bind/internalize the rfba after 5 h incubation . control is depicted in figure 5a, line  <dig>  in which no reaction was obtained in macrophages not incubated with rfba. positive  and negative  controls, are depicted. next, we investigated the putative role of fba in the interaction between paracoccidioides and macrophages. data represent the percentage of cfus recovered from infected macrophages, in relation to the control . the results show that infection of j <dig> by paracoccidioides was reduced by 79% when the macrophages were pre incubated with rfba, and 86% when the yeast cells were pre incubated with anti-rfba antibodies. the data strongly suggest a role for the fba in the infective process in macrophages.figure  <dig>

similar experiments with other proteins such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase, that promoted reduced interaction of paracoccidioides with pneumocytes and vero cells, were reported  <cit> . regarding to plg, the pre-incubation with paracoccidioides, in the presence of tpa, promoted increased macrophage infection . the addition of the antibodies to rfba and plg, prompted inhibited the macrophage infection. this data is consistent with the role of fba in activating plg to plasmin, as previously demonstrated in figure 4c. our data suggest that binding of the fba to plg, may increase the virulence of this pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
many microorganisms express proteins that are able to subvert the host proteases and use them in their favor. once activated to plasmin, plg acquires fibrinolytic activity. pathogens able to capture plg can increase their potential for dissemination in the host tissues. this work identified several secreted proteins of paracoccidioides with ability to bind to hplg. these proteins are probable targets of the interaction of the fungus with the host, probable acting as mediators of plasmin formation, which may contribute to the invasion of the fungus in the host tissues. the fba, was detected at the paracoccidioides surface and secretory vesicles, in addition to the conventional cytoplasmatic localization. the protein can bind to hplg, converting it to plasmin in the presence of tpa. this interaction promoted increased fibrinolytic capacity of the fungus, as demonstrated in fibrin degradation assay. moreover, we demonstrated that fba adhered to macrophages and contribute in some way to the interaction of the fungus with these defense cells. these data suggest that fba is a plg-binding protein, and may be important virulence factor involved in the process of adhesion, invasion and spread of the fungus.
