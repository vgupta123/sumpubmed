BACKGROUND
polyunsaturated fatty acids  are important metabolites, which have benefits on human and animal health. besides being a metabolic fuel, they also play crucial roles in membrane biology and signaling processes in living cells . as a consequence, the demand for pufas has continually increased in recent years. although pufas are widely distributed in natural resources, such as plant seed, fungi and marine organisms  <cit> , the search for economical and renewable resources of pufas has been extensively persued due to a concern for either an insecurity of supply or healthier performance of pufa products. metabolic engineering of the pufa biosynthetic pathway has been of considerable interest as an alternative approach to produce biomass rich in specific pufas  <cit> . however, this modern technology requires potent genes involved in relevant metabolic pathways.

pufa biosynthesis is generally associated with a set of membrane-bound enzymes, namely fatty acid desaturase and elongase, which catalyze the introduction of a double bond and the 2-carbon chain extension of fatty acids, respectively. these enzymes have different specificities on fatty acid substrates, relating to acyl chain length and double bond position  <cit> . ∆6-desaturase is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of n- <dig> and n- <dig> pufas, which is responsible for the conversion of essential fatty acids, linoleic acid  and α-linolenic acid  to γ-linolenic acid  and stearidonic acid , respectively. subsequently, the desaturated c <dig> pufas can be further metabolized to longer-chain pufas, such as arachidonic acid  and eicosapentaenoic acid , through alternating series of desaturation and elongation. the highly unsaturated fatty acid, epa, is one of the nutritionally important n- <dig> pufas, which can be synthesized via either n- <dig> or n- <dig> pathways. to manipulate the oil composition of organisms of choice, by a metabolic engineering approach, a high expression level of the ∆6-desaturase enzyme in a heterologous host is required. as well as optimized culture conditions, an efficient promoter and substrate availability, codon optimization is one of the most common approaches for improving heterologous gene expression in some host organisms . although genes encoding for ∆6-desaturase have been cloned and characterized from various organisms , research on codon optimization has been limited  <cit> .

very recently we employed pythium sp. bcc <dig> as a genetic resource for the isolation of the ∆6-elongase gene, based on its fatty acid profile  <cit> . this oomycete fungus synthesizes ara and epa as the end products of n- <dig> and n- <dig> pufas, respectively, indicating that it would be a potential source for the ∆6-desaturase gene. in this work, we have identified and functionally characterized the ∆6-desaturase gene of pythium sp. bcc <dig>  substrate specificity and preference were investigated by heterologous expression in s. cerevisiae. codon optimization of the ∆6-desaturase gene was also performed to enhance the product yield.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of the pythium ∆6-desaturase gene
the gene coding for ∆6-desaturase was cloned from pythium sp. using pcr technology. a 700-bp fragment was obtained, and its deduced amino acid sequence showed a high sequence similarity to ∆6-desaturases of other organisms. inverse pcr and race techniques were then performed to obtain the full-length cdna. under the optimized pcr conditions  the product targets approximately  <dig> and 400 bp in length, were derived from inverse pcr and 5′-race, respectively. taken together, the full-length pydes <dig> gene contained an orf of 1401 bp encoding  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the deduced amino acid sequence of pydes <dig> shared the highest homology with oomycete ∆6-desaturases, which had 68 % identity with the functionally characterized ∆6-desaturase from phytophthora infestans  <cit>  and pythium splendens  <cit> .

the pydes <dig> sequence contained a conserved characteristic of membrane-bound desaturases, which included three histidine-rich motifs . in addition, the cytochrome b5-like motif  was found at its n-terminus as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  hydropathy analysis of the pythium desaturase revealed five hydrophobic regions . all histidine-rich motifs were present in the hydrophilic portion that might be a location at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. these features coincide with a model of the topology of membrane-bound desaturases  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree revealed that pydes <dig> belongs to the ∆6-desaturase of oomycetes  close to the subgroup of marine algae. this result is in agreement with the fatty acid profile, which is used as a chemotaxonomic marker, showing that pythium sp. accumulates a n- <dig> long-chain pufa  similar to some marine algae, such as nannochloropsis oculata  <cit>  and phaeodactylum tricornutum  <cit> . these results suggest that this gene encodes a putative ∆6-desaturase, which might be responsible for the introduction of ∆6-double bond into acyl chains.fig.  <dig> topology model of pydes <dig>  enzyme topology was predicted based on tmhmm and phobius programs. the cylinders represent transmembrane regions of the enzyme, cytb

functional analysis of the pythium ∆6-desaturase
to verify the function of the cloned pythium desaturase, heterologous expression in s. cerevisiae, under the control of gal <dig> promoter, was performed. the transformed yeast cells were supplemented with linoleic acid  as a fatty acid substrate. after the induction of gene expression fatty acid analysis revealed an extra peak, with the retention time corresponding to γ-linolenic acid , was detected in the yeast transformants carrying the pydes <dig>  which was absent in the yeast containing empty vector pyes <dig> . this result confirmed that pydes <dig> encodes for ∆6-desaturase that catalyzes the insertion of double bond into la yielding gla.fig.  <dig> chromatographic profiles of the yeast transformants carrying pyes <dig> , ppydes <dig>  and pmpydes <dig>  plasmids. the transgenic yeasts were cultured in the presence of exogenous fatty acid substrates, la  and ala , and the gene expression was induced by addition of 2 %  galactose



substrate utilization of pydes <dig> was investigated by feeding the yeast transformants with fatty acids with different chain lengths and double bond positions, including saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and pufas. in addition to la substrate, pydes <dig> could catalyze the ∆6-desaturation of n- <dig> pufa, α-linolenic acid , yielding stearidonic acid  . in addition, the ∆6-desaturated 16c fatty acid  was detectable indicating that the endogenous monoene fatty acid  was a substrate for pydes <dig>  however, the endogenous and exogenous saturated fatty acids tested were not desaturated. considering substrate preference, there was not much difference between the conversion rates of la  and ala  to the respective ∆6-desaturated products .table  <dig> conversion rate of fatty acyl substrates of yeast transformants containing the recombinant plasmids

influence of codon optimization on pythium ∆6-desaturase activity
codon usage of the pydes <dig> for its expression in fungal system was optimized. using the optimumgene™ algorithm,  <dig>  % of the 1401-bp coding region was changed, which led to  <dig>  % codons being optimized. the gc content was reduced from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. codon adaptation index  of the optimized desaturase gene  was increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which is regarded as good in terms of high gene expression in the desired expression organism. the full-length cdna of mpydes <dig> was ligated to pyes <dig> vector under the control of gal <dig> promoter, generating the pmpydes <dig> plasmid. heterologous expression of the codon-optimized desaturase showed that the mpydes <dig> retained the function of ∆6-desaturase, which could convert la and ala to gla and sta, respectively . it could also convert endogenous monoene fatty acids, c16:1∆ <dig> and c18:1∆ <dig> to hexadecadienoic acid  and octadecadienoic acid , respectively, whereas only c16:2∆ <dig>  was slightly accumulated in the ppydes <dig> transformant. compared with the native enzyme , the conversion of la to gla by the mpydes <dig> transformant sharply increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. similarly, the higher conversion rate of ala  was found in the transformant carrying the codon-optimized desaturase . thus, the increase of ∆6-desaturated products was a result of codon optimization showing the effective approach for enhancement of the pufa production in fungal system. the yeast transformants with the empty vector , native  and codon-optimized  genes did not show difference in the cell growth and biomass .

discussion
the biosynthesis of long-chain pufas through a series of desaturation and elongation, the ∆6-desaturase has been documented to be a rate-limiting enzyme, and its expression is regulated by several factors  <cit> . among ∆6-desaturases from diverse organisms, there is a differentiation in catalytic activity in terms of utilization of acyl substrates that might be a result of genetic variation. the pydes <dig> gene identified from this work showed conserved characteristics of membrane-bound desaturases, including a cytochrome b <dig> and three histidine-rich motifs, and transmembrane domains  <cit> . it has been reported that the cytochrome b <dig> motif contributes as an electron donor in the electron transport system of fatty acid desaturation by forming the core of a heme binding domain  <cit> . the histidine-rich motifs are known to be the catalytically essential residues  <cit> .

from the study of substrate specificity, the pythium enzyme was specific to 16c and 18c fatty acid substrates having ∆9-double bond. thus, we classified the pydes <dig> into the front-end desaturase family, which catalyzes the addition of a double bond between the pre-existing double bond and the carboxyl end of pufas  <cit> . although the structural and functional characteristics of pydes <dig> shared common features of ∆6-desaturases for catalyzing pufa synthesis, the discrimination in substrate preference was found. interestingly, both n- <dig>  and n- <dig>  pufas having ∆9-double bond were substrates for pydes <dig> enzyme at a similar level of substrate conversion rate in contrast to phytophthora ∆6-desaturase, which prefers la over ala  <cit> . in the plant primula, ala was a preferred substrate for the ∆6-desaturase  <cit> .

the synthesis of long-chain pufas is derived from either the n- <dig> or n- <dig> pathway. the capability of pydes <dig> to utilize the n- <dig> fatty acid  and n- <dig> fatty acid  at a similar levels, facilitates the application of this gene for engineering of pufa pathway of choice in a broad range of organisms . the outcome will depend on substrate availability or the predominant fatty acid accumulated in the host cells. the low proportion of ∆6-desaturated products  found in the yeast transformant might be a result of a difference in codon usage between pythium and s. cerevisiae. this could be explained by the evolutionary relationship of the ∆6-desaturase gene derived from pythium which is closer to marine algae and diatoms than other fungi. this phenomenon is consistent with the taxonomic classification of fungal-like oomycetes  <cit> .

to enhance the production yields in engineered strain, the optimization of codon usage complemented to a host machinery of target was implemented in this study. the significant increase  in the substrate conversion rate observed in the yeast harboring codon-optimized gene was presumably derived from an improved translation efficiency in the host system. the increased gla content obtained by expressing the codon-optimized ∆6-desaturase of pythium in s. cerevisiae was relatively higher than the yeast cultures carrying ∆6-desaturases of other organisms  <cit> . these results suggest that codon usage of the host organism had a profound effect on the expression of pythium enzyme. additionally, substrate availability is also an important criterion for increasing the production yield of pufas, which can be achieved either through genetic or physiological manipulation.

the low lipid content found in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  is seen as a limitation to its use for high yield lipid production on a large scale. consequently the development of other known oleaginous strains is key to our target in the exploitation of metabolic engineering to develop organisms which deliver high product yield.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the cloning of a ∆6-desaturase gene from pythium sp. the gene encoded an enzyme which catalyzed the ∆6-desaturation of the fatty acyl substrates having ∆9-double bond. the product yields were markedly enhanced by codon optimization of the pythium gene. the redundancy in substrate utilization of the enzyme the codon-optimized gene could be exploited as potential genetic tool for production of nutritionally important pufa by reconstituting fatty acid profile in biological systems of commercial interest through n- <dig> or n- <dig> pathway.
