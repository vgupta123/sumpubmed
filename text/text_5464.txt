BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinases  are zn2+ dependent extracellular or membrane-bound proteinases with overlapping substrate specificities  <cit> . they are capable of cleaving proteinaceous components of the extracellular matrix  as well as non-ecm proteins  <cit> , thus affecting cell fate through modifications of cell's microenvironment. mmps have a similar domain structure that includes a prepeptide for secretion, a propeptide to maintain latency, and a catalytic domain, featured by the signature sequence hefghxxh, for substrate cleavage. the catalytic domain binds to a zn2+ ion through the three-histidine residues within the signature sequence to form the catalytic center  <cit> . the propeptide contains a highly conserved sequence, prcgxpd, the so called "cysteine switch", within which the cysteine residue interacts with the catalytic zn2+ to maintain enzyme latency  <cit> . most mmps are secreted as latent enzymes and processed to the active forms upon the removal of the propeptide domain through various mechanisms. other mmps, such as stromelysin  <dig> , mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  and membrane type mmps  are activated intracellularly through the removal of the propeptide domain by furin, a golgi enzyme  <cit> .

mmp expression and distribution have long implicated that mmps play important roles in many physiological processes including embryonic development, angiogenesis, tissue resorption and remodeling, and pathological events such as tumor invasion and arthritis  <cit> . in vitro and cell culture studies have provided strong evidence to show that mmps can regulate cell fate and behavior by remodeling the ecm. on the other hand, increasing evidences indicate that mmps are capable of cleaving non-ecm extracellular or membrane-bound proteins, suggesting the existence of multiple pathways for mmps to regulate cells. despite the extensive in vitro and cell culture studies, the in vivo functions of mmps are poorly understood. surprisingly, with a few exceptions, transgenic overexpression of mmps and mmp knockouts in mouse have little or weak phenotypes on mouse development  <cit> . this appears to be at least in part due to the redundancy in mmp expression and function. these findings emphasize the need for further in vivo studies by using different model systems.

frog metamorphosis offers a unique opportunity to study mmp function during postembryonic development in vertebrates. this process is totally dependent on the presence of thyroid hormone  and mimics the postembryonic period from a few months before to several months after birth in humans  <cit> . during metamorphosis, dramatic tissue-specific remodeling occurs through th-regulated cell fate changes. these include complete absorption of the gill and the tail, de novo generation of the limbs, and remodeling of most other organs such as the intestine. for example, in the intestine, the larval epithelial cells die through apoptosis and adult epithelial progenitor cells, which may be derived from de-differentiated larval epithelial cells, proliferate and eventually differentiate to form a multiply folded adult epithelium  <cit> . numerous studies have shown that the metamorphic effects of th are mediated by thyroid hormone receptors, which control a gene regulation cascade by regulating the transcription of the so-called direct th-response genes. these direct response genes in turn affect the expression of indirect th-response genes to eventually regulate cell fate and behavior during metamorphosis. initial isolation and characterization of th-response genes revealed that xenopus  laevis st <dig>  and collagenase  <dig> , and rana catesbeiana collagenase  <dig>  are regulated by th during metamorphosis. subsequent studies have found that essentially all mmps analyzed so far are regulated by th in at least some organs/tissues during metamorphosis  <cit> . among them, st <dig> and mmp9-th in x. laevis and collagenase  <dig> in rana catesbeiana have been shown to be direct response genes with thyroid hormone response elements present in their promoters  <cit> . furthermore, in vitro organ culture analysis and in vivo analyses have provided strong evidence for the participation of mmps in metamorphosis  <cit> . for example, we have demonstrated that st <dig> is required for th-induced ecm remodeling, intestinal larval epithelial apoptosis as well as adult epithelial cell migration in organ cultures and that transgenic overexpression of st <dig> alone at premetamorphic stages, e.g., stage  <dig>  can induce larval epithelial apoptosis and ecm remodeling in the intestine in the absence of th  <cit> . these functional studies directly proved the function of st <dig> as first suggested based on expression analyses. since all mmps analyzed so far are regulated by th during metamorphosis, it is pertinent to ask whether the rest of the mmps are also regulated by th and whether different mmps have different functions during metamorphosis in different organs/tissues.

as an initiative to begin to address these important issues, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis of mmp genes in both x. laevis and x. tropicalis through a bioinformatic approach by making use of the genome sequence information for x. tropicalis and cdna sequences available for x. laevis and tropicalis genes from the nih frog initiatives program. we demonstrate that essentially all mammalian mmps have homologs in xenopus, although the homologs for some mmps cannot be assigned with certainty. furthermore, we have discovered a number of novel mmps and duplications that are uniquely present in the amphibian genome.

RESULTS
bioinformatic search for xenopus mmps
many x. laevis mmps were previously cloned  <cit> . these cdna sequences were used to search for other mmps in the public est database at the ncbi  and the gene index project in computational biology and function genomics laboratory . putative mmp protein sequences that were derived from the retrieved cdna sequences were pooled and analyzed on a phylogenetic tree. closely related entries were compared pair-wise by using macvector  and redundant sequences were removed. the resulting x. laevis mmps were listed in table  <dig> . compared to human mmps, some x. laevis mmps were missing from the list and some others had highly homologous duplicates, likely due to the pseudotetraploid x. laevis genome. the missing ones could be due to either the absence of the genes in xenopus genome or incomplete sequence data available. thus, we also searched and analyzed the cdna sequences for mmps in the highly related species, x. tropicalis. we aligned the cdna sequences of x. laevis or tropicalis mmps to the jgi x. tropicalis genomic scaffolds  . when needed, we also used human mmp sequences to search the x. tropicalis genome database to ensure a complete search of the genome.

#comparison of x. laevis and x. tropicalis mmps. pair-wise comparisons were done to obtain the percent of identities between the mmps from the two species .

pair-wise sequence comparison  and phylogenetic analysis  allowed us to assign most of the xenopus mmps to the corresponding human homologs  . as shown in table  <dig>  all x. laevis mmps have a corresponding homolog in x. tropicalis and the homologs are highly conserved with over 80% amino acid sequence identities between x. laevis and x. tropicalis. these include a duplicated gelatinase b  that is absent in mouse and human genome. as x. laevis is a pseudotetraploid organism, it is not surprising that some mmps  have duplicate copies in x. laevis but only one in x. tropicalis. only four x. tropicalis mmps  have no available homologs in x. laevis yet, likely due to incomplete cdna sequence information available for x. laevis.

xenopus mmps with known human homologs
phylogenetic  and pair-wise sequence  analyses suggest that the following human mmps have true homologs in xenopus genome: mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  the homologous human and x. tropicalis mmps cluster together in the phylogenetic tree  and share highest sequence identities with each other than with any other mmps  . in addition, the homologous mmps have similar lengths and domain organizations .

likely xenopus homologs of human mmps
the homologs of the rest of human mmps could not be easily identified based on sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. these mmps may have corresponding homologs in xenopus but their sequences have diverged significantly that it is difficult to match the human and xenopus counterparts. for these mmps, we kept the putative names for any xenopus mmps with previously assigned names in the public databases or assigned the names as described below.

mmp1
there were two entries for x. laevis mmp <dig> , encoding two closely related mmps of  <dig> amino acids  that are 90% identical . alignment of these x. laevis mmp1s  to the x. tropicalis genomic scaffolds showed significant homology at three different loci on the scaffold_ <dig> . the putative cdna sequences were derived from these loci and used to deduce the protein sequences of three related mmps. among these three putative mmp genes, the best-matched one has 87% identities with x. laevis mmp1s and has the same length; it was therefore named as x. tropicalis mmp <dig> . the other two were tentatively named as x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> and n <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis revealed that x. tropicalis mmp <dig>  mmp n <dig> and n <dig> cluster together with mmp n <dig> and n <dig> more closely related to each other than to mmp <dig> . these mmps are related to several human mmp subfamilies including collagenases  and stromelysins , etc. the mmp that is most closely related to these three mmps is x. tropicalis mmp <dig>  a homolog of x. laevis mmp <dig> . x. laevis mmp <dig> is a known collagenase  <cit> , suggesting that these three mmps are collagenases. apart from the typical mmp domains , x. tropicalis mmp <dig>  as well as x. laevis mmp1a and 1b, contains a  <dig> aa proline-rich motif after the catalytic domain that distinguishes collagenases from stromelysins, although the x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> and n <dig> have deletions within the region  . these mmps share less than 60% identity with x. laevis collagenases mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  in addition, they are also three amino acids shorter than the human mmp <dig> at the c- terminus , just like the x. laevis mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  taken together, these mmp genes are likely x. tropicalis collagenases, but it is possible that the x. tropicalis mmp <dig> is not the true homolog of human mmp <dig>  especially considering that the mmp <dig> from another amphibian species, rana catesbeiana, is much more homologous to human mmp <dig>  although much shorter, compared to xenopus mmp <dig>   <cit> .

mmp3
mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  also referred to as stromelysin  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, are mmps that have quite broad substrate specificities and were originally described as proteoglycanases  <cit> . neither xenopus mmp <dig> nor mmp <dig> has been characterized. a putative mmp deduced from a cdna entry for each xenopus species  structurally resembles mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> . similar to human mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  the xenopus mmp has an insertion  in the  <dig> aa proline-rich motif after the catalytic domain whose integrity is important for collagenase activity . this suggests that the xenopus mmp is likely a stromelysin. the two xenopus homologs share 84% identity, although the x. laevis one is  <dig> aa shorter than x. tropicalis mmp <dig> at the n-terminus, likely due to incomplete 5'-end cdna sequence. thus, the xenopus mmps are homologs of each other and are tentatively named as mmp <dig> since they are slightly more similar to human mmp <dig> than mmp <dig> .

mmp23
mmp <dig> is characterized by the presence of a furin activation site, a type ii transmembrane domain at the n-terminus, and a unique truncated c-terminal domain unrelated to the hemopexin domain found in other mmps, and it lacks a typical prepeptide  <cit> . there are two reported mmp <dig>  mmp23a and mmp23b, in human that are encoded by two genes, likely due to a very recent, partial duplication at chromosome 1p <dig>   <cit> . human mmp23a and b are identical in amino acid sequences and thus both are referred to as mmp <dig> here. two overlapping est entries  encode a putative x. laevis mmp <dig> of 381aa. sequence search of the x. tropicalis genome identified a putative x. tropicalis mmp <dig> on scaffold_ <dig>  there was no est entry representing the x. tropicalis mmp <dig>  however, two x. tropicalis est entries  composed of cdna sequences that together encode another putative mmp related to mmp <dig> . these cdna sequences aligned on to x. tropicalis genomic scaffold_ <dig>  x. tropicalis mmp <dig> and mmp n <dig> differ from each other at both the cdna and protein sequence levels, unlike the two human mmp <dig> genes . sequence comparison showed that x. laevis mmp <dig>  x. tropicalis mmp <dig> and mmp n <dig> have the same features of human mmp <dig>  although there is a sequence gap in x. tropicalis mmp <dig> , possibly due to incomplete genomic sequence information . the xenopus mmp  <dig>  mmp n <dig>  and human mmp <dig> cluster together and are away from all other mmps  with the mmp <dig> sharing 60% identity between xenopus and human, similar to other homologous mmps .

mmp21
mmp <dig> was first cloned in x. laevis  <cit> . it has since been found to be present in other vertebrates including human. the common features of this mmp across different species, in addition to those characteristics of mmps, are a putative furin cleavage site between the propetide and the catalytic domain, a relative long insertion  between the prcgxpd cysteine switch motif and the furin cleavage site , and a unique cysteine residue in the catalytic domain . the putative x. tropicalis mmp <dig> composes of  <dig> aa and shares 92% and 59% identities with the x. laevis and human mmp <dig>  respectively .

interestingly, sequence search also revealed a cdna entry , composed of x. tropicalis ests dr <dig> and cx <dig>  that encodes a putative mmp of  <dig> aa. this mmp is highly homologous to x. tropicalis mmp <dig> and is tentatively named as x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> . in addition,  <dig> highly homologous x. laevis ests, bg <dig>  bu <dig>  cb <dig>  and cf <dig>  were also found to constitute a putative cdna sequence encoding a homolog of x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> . the x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> is located on the x. tropicalis genomic scaffold_ <dig>  from which the rest 5'-end cdna sequence was predicted. the putative x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> aa. the n-terminal sequence of x. laevis mmp n <dig> is still missing in the databases. sequence comparison clearly showed that mmp n <dig> is highly homologous to mmp <dig> and is likely derived from a gene duplication event . furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that xenopus mmp <dig> clusters with human mmp <dig> and is closely related to mmp n <dig> 

mmp <dig> and 26
mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> are the smallest mmps known and have no hemopexin domain at their c-terminus  <cit> . x. laevis mmp <dig> was previously reported  and found to be expressed specifically in tissue resident macrophages  <cit> . bioinformatic search revealed a closely related x. laevis cdna clone  encoding a protein of  <dig> aa vs.  <dig> aa for x. laevis mmp <dig>  these two x. laevis mmps shared 85% identities in amino acid sequences and 82% identities in nucleotide sequences, and therefore, are likely duplicated mmp <dig> genes in the pseudotetraploid genome. we designated them as mmp7a  and 7b , respectively. both x. laevis mmp7a and 7b aligned to x. tropicalis scaffold_ <dig> at the location that encodes a x. tropicalis cdna . thus, this x. tropicalis cdna represents x. tropicalis mmp <dig>  x. tropicalis mmp <dig> is  <dig> aa in length and highly homologous to x. laevis mmp7a/b .

in addition to the mmp <dig> genes, the x. laevis cdna clone mgc <dig>  and x. tropicalis cdna clone mgc <dig>  also encode a small mmp each . like mmp <dig>  both proteins lacked the hemopexin domain . they share 88% identities with each other and the x. tropicalis gene is also located on x. tropicalis genomic scaffold_ <dig>  these two proteins are closely related to x. laevis mmp7a/b and x. tropicalis mmp <dig> on the phylogenetic tree and thus are tentatively named as x. laevis mmp <dig> and x. tropicalis mmp <dig>  respectively. .

surprisingly, an additional x. tropicalis clone  was also found to encode a similar mmp lacking the hemopexin domain. the cdna sequence had two in-frame stop codons after the 3'-end of the coding sequence  and another independent est sequence  overlapped with this region with 100% identity . thus, this gene represents a novel mmp that is structurally similar to mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  it is tentatively named as x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> . x tropicalis mmp n <dig> is also located on x. tropicalis scaffold_ <dig> in between mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  suggesting that it was derived from a gene duplication event.

novel xenopus mmps
gelatinases
sequence analysis revealed the existence of an alternatively spliced form of x. laevis gelatinase a  . this alternatively spliced mmp <dig> transcript encodes a mmp that lacks most of the catalytic domain, including the zinc binding motif, and part of the c-terminal hemopexin domain. to date, no such spliced form of mmp <dig> has been reported for other vertebrate species, including x. tropicalis.

in addition, there are two mmps in both x. laevis and x. tropicalis that are highly homologous to mmp <dig> or gelatinase b, mmp <dig> and mmp9th, respectively  <cit>  , and both cluster with human mmp <dig> in the phylogenetic tree . xenopus mmp <dig> and mmp9th have all the features characteristic of a gelatinase . since only one mmp <dig> genes have been found in other vertebrates, mmp9th and mmp <dig> represent a unique duplication in xenopus.

mmp n1
the assembly of a group of overlapping x. laevis ests  led to a cdna  encoding a protein of  <dig> aa that lacks the n-terminus and shares low levels of homologies with others mmps but has all the characteristics of an mmp . similarly, the homologous x. tropicalis ests could be assembled into a cdna encoding a full length mmp of  <dig> aa that is 90% homologous to the x. laevis counterpart . this x. tropicalis mmp has less than 40% homology to any of human mmps and represents a novel frog mmp tentatively named as x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> . its counterpart in x. laevis is therefore named as x. laevis mmp n <dig> .

while the xenopus mmp n <dig> has all the domains typical of an mmp, there are some differences distinguishing it from other mmps. first, both x. laevis and x. tropicalis mmp n <dig> had a "cysteine-switch" made of "prcgkhe" instead of the conserved "prcgxxd" sequence and a deletion of two amino acid residues around the predicted cleavage site for the mature mmps . second, these two mmps are most similar to collagenases and stromelysins in their domain organization but have a  <dig> aa insertion in the  <dig> aa collagen-binding motif of collagenases at the exact position where an insertion is found for stromelysins . finally, there are a number of insertions throughout xenopus mmp n <dig> compared to human collagenases and stromelysins . these unique features suggest that xenopus mmp n <dig> is a novel mmp distinct from other known mmps.

mmp n2
as described above, there are three x. tropicalis mmps homologous to human mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  sequence analyses allowed us to assign two of them as x. tropicalis mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  respectively. the third one thus represents a novel gene of this subfamily . interestingly, all three x. tropicalis mmp genes are located consecutively on a single chromosome with mmpn <dig> in between mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> , suggesting that a duplication event in amphibians led to the extra mmp in the subfamily.

mmp n3
mmp n <dig> is one of the two genes in both x. laevis and x. tropicalis that have similar levels of homology to human mmp <dig> . although mmp n <dig> and mmp <dig> are located in different scaffolds in x. tropicalis genomic sequence, it is possible that they are located adjacent to each other in a chromosome as the genomic sequence annotation is incomplete in x. tropicalis. thus, these two genes might have derived from a unique gene duplication event in amphibians.

collagenases
based on sequence features and its enzymatic activity, x. laevis mmp <dig> was proposed to be a novel collagenase  <cit> . indeed, potential homologs of mammalian collagenases mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> have been reported for xenopus. interestingly, while the amphibian mmp <dig> and human mmp <dig> are 67% identical, the corresponding mmp1s are only 51% identical , similar to the levels of homology that mmp <dig> has with human collagenases . furthermore, human mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> have  <dig> extra amino acids  at the c-terminus that are lacking in xenopus mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> as well as the putative, novel xenopus collagenases  . in addition, a most likely homolog of human mmp <dig> has been reported for another amphibian species, rana catesbeiana  <cit> . the rana mmp <dig> is much shorter but much more homologous to human mmp <dig> , compared to these xenopus collagenases . furthermore, unlike the xenopus mmp <dig>  the rana mmp <dig> clusters with human mmp <dig> on the phylogenetic tree . thus, it is possible that mmp <dig> has diverged extensively between amphibians and mammals, leading to a very different size in rana or its loss in xenopus. on the other hand, all known and putative collagenases in xenopus are located consecutively in a single chromosome in the order of mmp <dig>  mmp n <dig>  mmp n <dig>  mmp <dig>  and mmp <dig> . this suggests that multiple duplication events might be responsible for the generation of these mmps. it is interesting to note that human mmp  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are all encoded by chromosome  <dig> . with the exception of four mmps  that have no apparent homologs in x. tropicalis, the other six mmps found on human chromosome  <dig> are clustered on the scaffold_ <dig> together with four frog-specific ones  in x. tropicalis . thus, x. tropicalis scaffold_ <dig> appears to contain a large region syntenic to human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, with the exception of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  it is difficult to determine which mmp in this cluster of  <dig> x. tropicalis mmps is the homolog of an mmp in the human cluster based on sequence homology and syntenic analyses. x. tropicalis mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> share high degrees of homology  with their human counterparts, supporting that they are true homologs of the human mmps. consistently, phylogenetic analysis of x. tropicalis and human mmps showed that these two mmps evolved earlier than the other mmps in the cluster . in addition, the drastic differences in the distances between mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> on the chromosome   and on the phylogenetic trees , suggest that this duplication occurred after the separation of amphibians from mammals. the other six mmps in the cluster appear to have diverged rapidly during evolution and/or evolved through duplications and/or losses independently in amphibians and mammals.

CONCLUSIONS
through a bioinformatic approach, we have identified xenopus homologs for most human mmps. by comparing the mmps in the two highly related species, x. tropicalis and x. laevis, we have been able to discover several unique duplications of mmps genes in amphibians that are absent in mammals. on the other hand, several human mmps have no apparent homologs in xenopus and were possibly evolved de novo in mammals. among the likely duplicated genes, genes in the following two pairs, mmp <dig> and mmp9th, mmp <dig> and mmp n <dig>  mmp  <dig>  and mmp n <dig>  are more homologous to each other than to their human homologs , suggesting that the duplications occurred after the separation of amphibians from mammals. on the other hand, mmp <dig> clusters closer to its human homolog than to the putative duplicate mmp n <dig> , suggesting the possibility that mmp <dig> might have duplicated before the separation of amphibians and mammals and one copy was lost subsequently in mammals. duplications and loss in mmp genes are also evident when comparing the largest mmp cluster located on human chromosome  <dig> with the mmp cluster on x. tropicalis scaffold_ <dig>  where a number of novel mmps were found and several mmps were lost in x. tropicalis. our findings thus demonstrate a dynamic process for mmp gene evolution. it will be of interest in the future to investigate whether mmp expression and function are conserved during vertebrate development. the sequence information reported here and the advantage of the amphibian metamorphosis for functional studies in vivo should facilitate such an endeavor in the near future.
