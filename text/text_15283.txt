BACKGROUND
the effects of synergistic activity have been gaining attention in the treatment of diseases such as cancer and aids  <cit> . drug or ligand synergy is defined as the joint action of two or more agents for which the result is greater than the sum of the actions of the individual parts. synergistic therapeutic strategies therefore have the potential to accelerate the response to treatment, achieve higher efficacy, and potentially reduce the side effects associated with single treatment approaches  <cit> . indeed, several studies have demonstrated the benefits of the co-administration of neurotrophic factors  <cit>  and the combinatorial treatment of nerve growth factor  with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor   <cit>  or insulin-like growth factor - <dig>  <cit>  in promoting synergistic axonal or neurite elongation. axonal and dendritic outgrowth from the neuronal cell body is a key cellular aspect of neuronal differentiation that is critically important not just in development, but also in recovery from injuries and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . following nerve injury, the rate of nerve regeneration is critical, as a full functional recovery can be impeded by delayed regeneration  <cit> . thus, accelerating or facilitating neurite outgrowth through a synergistic approach may provide a valuable treatment strategy for patients with nerve injury. however, the mechanisms underlying such synergistic action are currently not well understood.

rat pheochromocytoma pc <dig> cells have been widely used as a model to study neuronal differentiation. upon treatment with ligands such as the ngf  <cit> , basic-fibroblast growth factor   <cit> , and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide   <cit> , pc <dig> cells differentiate into sympathetic neuron-like cells characterized by long-term and stable neurite outgrowth. these ligands regulate neurite outgrowth through pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>   <cit> , p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase   <cit> , c-jun n-terminal kinase   <cit> , and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase   <cit> . in comparison, epidermal growth factor  promotes proliferation instead of differentiation in these cells  <cit> . studies have attributed this difference in cell fate to the kinetics of erk activation, where transient or sustained erk activation leads to proliferation or differentiation, respectively  <cit> . although egf alone does not induce neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells, it has been found to synergize with cyclic adenosine monophosphate -elevating agents such as pacap and forskolin, thereby enhancing neurite outgrowth  <cit> . consistent with the knowledge that erk is important in regulating differentiation, enhanced erk activity has also been observed in the synergy model  <cit> . similarly, camp-elevating agents have also been found to synergize with fgfb  <cit>  and ngf  <cit>  to enhance neurite outgrowth, where both p <dig> and erk have been found to regulate neurite outgrowth induced by ngf-camp  <cit> . whereas ngf, fgfb and egf can all cooperate with camp-elevating agents to enhance neurite outgrowth, an interesting question is whether these three systems activate a common set of signaling pathways to mediate such synergy.

in this study, we investigated the activation and involvement of various signaling pathways in synergistic neurite outgrowth using three combinations of ligands: ngf-pacap , fgfb-pacap  and egf-pacap . as expected, all three systems showed a synergistic phosphorylation of erk concomitant with neurite outgrowth. interestingly, jnk, but not akt or p <dig>  was also synergistically activated in all three systems. unexpectedly, inhibition of jnk blocked neurite outgrowth in the np and fp, but not ep, systems. this differential involvement of jnk was found to be dependent on the regulation of p90rsk activity. thus, a jnk-p90rsk link was identified as a hitherto unrecognized mechanism mediating the synergistic effect in neurite outgrowth. our results therefore demonstrate the involvement of distinct signaling pathways in regulating neurite outgrowth in response to different synergistic growth factor-pacap stimulation.

RESULTS
response surface analyses suggests that synergistic neurite outgrowth is regulated by discrete mechanisms in different systems
ngf  <cit> , fgfb  <cit>  and egf  <cit>  are known to synergize with camp-elevating agents to enhance neurite outgrowth. ngf or fgfb cause considerably longer neurite outgrowth than egf or pacap . to better visualize the synergistic action between growth factors and pacap on neurite length, we used a response surface model   <cit>  and examined the effect of ngf-pacap , fgfb-pacap  and egf-pacap  treatments in these cells. the cells were treated with the ligands singly and in combination. in these plots, the neurite length obtained after  <dig> hours of combinatorial treatment was compared to that obtained by a summation of neurite length induced by the individual ligands . surface plots of the three systems—np ), fp ), and ep )—clearly indicated that combinatorial treatments resulted in longer neurites than the additive effects of single ligand exposure, indicating synergism. these plots also showed that synergism  occurred over a wide range of doses of growth factors and pacap. to further illustrate that synergistic neurite outgrowth can occur even with low doses of pacap, an isobologram  <cit>  was plotted for each of the three systems , 1b, &1c). significantly higher concentrations of pacap were required in the absence of any growth factors to obtain similar neurite lengths. in addition, in the np and fp systems, the saturating neurite length for the combinatorial treatment was about twice that of the additive effect, whereas a difference of about 4-fold was observed for the ep system. this indicates a higher degree of synergism in the ep system, and suggests that synergistic neurite outgrowth in the ep system may differ mechanistically from those of the np and fp systems. representative images of the neurite outgrowth in each system are shown in figure 1d.

synergistic phosphorylation of erk & jnk upon combinatorial growth factor-pacap treatment
we hypothesized that there was likely to be synergistic activation of the various kinases that regulate synergistic neurite outgrowth. to examine the pathways involved in regulating synergistic neurite outgrowth in these systems, we conducted a time-course to determine changes in the phosphorylation levels of four kinases—akt, erk, jnk, and p38—upon ngf, pacap, and np treatments. the kinases were activated throughout the entire  <dig> hour time-course . thus, for convenience, subsequent analyses were performed only at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes time-points.

after treating the cells with multiple doses of ngf and pacap, the phosphorylation levels of erk, jnk , p <dig> and akt  were quantified and analyzed for synergism. single ligand treatment with ngf but not pacap induced sustained erk phosphorylation. to analyze for synergistic activation of erk, effects upon combinatorial treatments of np was compared to the additive effect of the individual ligands. in the presence of both ligands, erk phosphorylation was higher than the additive effects of ngf and pacap separately . this is in congruence with the finding that ngf and np treatment but not pacap induced extensive neurite outgrowth, and is consistent with the idea that sustained erk phosphorylation is involved in neurite outgrowth  <cit> .

similarly, sustained activation of jnk by ngf was observed . in addition, we made the novel discovery that jnk was also synergistically phosphorylated upon combinatorial np treatment  and it was sustained for up to  <dig> hour post-stimulation. on the contrary, using the same analyses, synergistic phosphorylation of p <dig>  and akt  were not observed in the np system.

having found that erk and jnk were synergistically phosphorylated in the np system, we next investigated if these trends were also common to the fp and ep systems. similar to the np system, sustained and synergistic erk , & b) and jnk , & b) phosphorylation were observed for the fp and ep treatments, respectively, within  <dig> hour of stimulation. likewise, neither p <dig> , & s4b) nor akt , & s4b) were synergistically phosphorylated in the fp and ep systems. thus, these results indicate that specific kinases were synergistically phosphorylated by growth factor-pacap co-treatment, suggestive of their roles in mediating synergistic neurite outgrowth.

the total protein levels of erk, jnk, p <dig> and akt upon treatment with single ligand or combinations of the growth factors and pacap were unchanged across all conditions and time-points .

erk is required for neurite outgrowth in all  <dig> systems whereas jnk is required only for the np and fp, but not ep, systems
we next examined the role of these synergistically activated kinases in regulating neurite outgrowth using kinase inhibitors. as expected, treatment with the mek inhibitor, u <dig>  inhibited neurite outgrowth in the np system in a dose-dependent manner , & additional file 6: figure s6). similarly, inhibition of mek also blocked neurite outgrowth in the fp and ep systems , confirming the involvement of synergistic erk phosphorylation in neurite outgrowth. further supporting the involvement of synergistically phosphorylated kinases in regulating synergistic neurite outgrowth, the jnk inhibitor, sp <dig>  blocked neurite outgrowth in the np , & additional file 6: figure s6) and fp systems . surprisingly, sp <dig> at the same concentration  failed to inhibit neurite outgrowth in the ep system, showing instead enhanced neurite outgrowth . higher concentrations of sp <dig> were deemed to be cytotoxic . positive controls for the effects of u <dig> and sp <dig> are shown in additional file 7: figure s7a and s7b, respectively.

as expected, inhibition of the non-synergistically activated nodes, p <dig> and akt, by sb <dig>  and ly <dig>  respectively, did not block neurite outgrowth in all three systems -, b, c, & additional file 6: figure s6). likewise, cells treated with doses of the inhibitors at concentrations higher than  <dig> μm resulted in high levels of cytotoxicity . the positive controls for sb <dig> and ly <dig> are shown in additional file 7: figure s7c and s7d, respectively.

next, the reduction in neurite outgrowth, after treatment with inhibitors, for the np treatment was compared to the sum of reduction of neurite outgrowth in the single ligand treatments. with u <dig> ) and sp <dig> ), the reduction in neurite outgrowth in the np treatment was greater than the sum of reduction for the single ligand treatments. similarly, for the fp  and ep  systems, inhibition of the kinases required for neurite outgrowth also resulted in a greater reduction in neurite outgrowth in the combinatorial growth factor-pacap treatments than the sum of reduction for the respective single ligand treatments. these results support the involvement of the various kinases in regulating synergistic neurite outgrowth in the respective synergistic systems.

critically, these results also suggest that these systems utilize distinct pathways to regulate neurite outgrowth and that not all synergistically phosphorylated kinases are relevant to neurite outgrowth.

p90rsk is a downstream target of both erk & jnk in the np & fp systems but is only downstream of erk in the ep system
having found that jnk was involved in neurite outgrowth in the np and fp, but not ep, systems, we sought to identify the downstream targets that may be involved in mediating this differential requirement of jnk. among the many downstream effectors of jnk, p90rsk has been recently shown to be involved in neurite outgrowth and pc <dig> cells differentiation  <cit> . thus, we examined if p90rsk was synergistically phosphorylated and if it was involved in jnk-mediated neurite outgrowth.

as expected, p90rsk was synergistically phosphorylated in the np -a, & additional file 8: figure s8a), fp ) and ep ) systems from  <dig> minutes to  <dig> hour after stimulation. in all three systems, neurite outgrowth was inhibited in the presence of the p90rsk inhibitor, brd <dig>  <cit>  , b, c, & additional file 8: figure s8b). in these systems, greater reductions in neurite outgrowth were also achieved in the combinatorial growth factor-pacap treatments than for the sum of the reduction in neurite outgrowth in the respective single ligand treatments , supporting the involvement of p90rsk in regulating synergistic neurite outgrowth in all three systems.

to validate the role of p90rsk as a downstream effector of synergistically activated jnk in the three systems, the phosphorylation level of p90rsk was examined after inhibition with sp <dig>  surprisingly, treatment with sp <dig> inhibited p90rsk phosphorylation in the np  and fp , but not ep , systems. these results strongly suggest that the regulation of p90rsk by the jnk pathway could be a critical determinant of jnk involvement in regulating synergistic neurite outgrowth.

in addition to jnk, p90rsk has also been reported to be a downstream target of erk  <cit> . unlike the case for jnk inhibition, inhibition of erk activation with u <dig> suppressed p90rsk phosphorylation in all three systems , providing further support for the role of p90rsk as an important mediator of neurite outgrowth. the total levels of erk, jnk, and p90rsk were unchanged during the combinatorial growth factor-pacap treatments both in the presence and absence of the inhibitors .

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated the involvement of distinct combinations of signaling pathways in mediating synergistic neurite outgrowth induced by pacap and different growth factors . in these systems, erk, jnk, and p90rsk were all found to be synergistically phosphorylated. however, synergistic jnk phosphorylation was not required for neurite outgrowth following stimulation with the combination of egf and pacap. further investigations led to the crucial finding that the jnk-p90rsk link is critical to the involvement of jnk in regulating synergistic neurite outgrowth in some but not all growth factor-pacap stimulation combinations.

camp-elevating agents have long been known to synergize with ngf  <cit> , fgfb  <cit> , and egf  <cit>  to enhance neurite outgrowth. although the pathways used by these individual ligands to regulate neurite outgrowth have been widely studied, little is known about the mechanisms underlying synergistic neurite outgrowth. rsm-based analyses provide a means to quantitatively compare the degree of synergism between different treatments  <cit> . by such analyses, the degree of synergism in the ep system was found to be higher than those in the np and fp systems, suggesting that different signaling pathways may regulate neurite outgrowth in these systems.

to determine the pathways involved in synergistic neurite outgrowth, four kinases were examined, each widely reported to be involved in pc <dig> cells differentiation: erk  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , jnk  <cit> , and akt  <cit> . interestingly, our results showed that akt and p <dig> were activated following ligand stimulation but not involved in neurite outgrowth in all three systems. in agreement with this, inhibition of these two kinases also failed to suppress ngf-induced pc <dig> cells neurite outgrowth. these results were consistent with some of the earlier reports exploring neurite outgrowth  <cit>  but not others  <cit> . a recent systems-based study revealed a two-dimensional erk-akt signaling code that was critical in governing pc <dig> cells proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . thus, the controversy surrounding the involvement of p <dig> and akt would be more adequately addressed using systems-based approaches in the future.

the sustained activation of erk has been widely reported to be required for neurite outgrowth during differentiation  <cit> . consistent with these reports, synergistic and sustained erk phosphorylation was found to be involved in neurite outgrowth in all three growth factor-pacap systems. this was especially evident in the ep system, where transient erk activation was observed following treatment with egf or pacap alone. similarly, synergistic and sustained jnk phosphorylation was observed in all three systems. remarkably, inhibition of jnk led to reduced neurite outgrowth in the np and fp systems, but enhanced outgrowth in the ep system. although a previous study has found sustained jnk activation to be sufficient to induce pc <dig> cells differentiation  <cit> , our results showed that sustained jnk activation in the ep system is insufficient to induce neurite outgrowth. these seemingly contradictory findings could imply that the kinetics of jnk activation alone is insufficient to determine if cells undergo differentiation. it is likely that jnk acts in conjunction with other signaling nodes to form a signaling network that regulates neurite outgrowth. nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the involvement of jnk phosphorylation in synergistic neurite outgrowth.

we have shown that both erk and jnk were synergistically phosphorylated in all three systems. this may occur through shared common upstream effectors  <cit>  or through independent upstream effectors, such as pka and epac  <cit> . in preliminary experiments, we observed the involvement of pka in neurite outgrowth in the ep but not np system ; however, a complete understanding of the contribution of pka and epac in erk and jnk activation remains to be determined.

although synergistic jnk phosphorylation was observed in all three systems, it was not found to be involved in synergistic neurite outgrowth in the ep system. this suggests a possible difference in downstream signaling. p90rsk, which had previously been found to be required for pc <dig> cells differentiation  <cit> , was also found to be synergistically activated in all three systems in our study. interestingly, p90rsk was activated by jnk in the np and fp, but not ep, systems. although jnk-mediated activation of p90rsk has not been widely reported, it has been observed following ultraviolet exposure  <cit> , insulin treatment  <cit> , or transforming growth factor alpha treatment  <cit> . consistent with previous findings  <cit> , p90rsk was also regulated by erk in our study. the co-regulation of targets by erk and jnk is not uncommon, with previous studies showing that these two kinases regulate many common targets, including transcription factors  <cit> , immediate early genes  <cit>  and differentiation-specific genes  <cit> . despite this, results from several studies have suggested that the binding sites of p90rsk for erk and jnk are likely to be different  <cit> , further indicating that p90rsk may be discretely regulated by the two kinases. our finding of the differential regulation of p90rsk in the np and ep systems in this study strongly suggests that these synergistic systems can serve as excellent models to decipher the mechanistic regulation of p90rsk by its upstream kinases, erk and jnk. the contributions of erk, jnk and p90rsk in the mechanism of axonal outgrowths of neurons in vivo and in vitro will require further clarification in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study has demonstrated distinct pathways involved in synergistic neurite outgrowth in different systems. importantly, our findings of the underlying pathways involved in these systems have two key implications. first, some kinases such as jnk may be synergistically activated by multiple ligands but yet not necessarily involved in the synergistic neurite outgrowth process and that its involvement in neurite outgrowth is dependent on its interaction with p90rsk. second, in the ep system, the increased synergy in neurite outgrowth and lack of jnk requirement for regulating the process suggest that pacap synergizes differently with different growth factors to enhance neurite outgrowth. these findings reveal that synergistic of neurite outgrowths induced by multiple ligands involves the interplay of a network of signals.
