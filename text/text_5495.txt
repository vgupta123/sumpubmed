BACKGROUND
the sensory cells of mammalian chemosensory systems are unusual in that they have a limited lifespan and thus must undergo regular replacement throughout life  <cit> . in the taste system, these sensory cells are located within end organs called taste buds, which are located in  <dig> distinct sets of papillae in the tongue epithelium, as well as on the palate and epiglottis. taste buds are integrative structures containing diverse cell types that interact with each other and with afferent nerve endings in ways that are complex, and as yet not fully understood  <cit> . the diversity of cells in the taste bud was first appreciated as morphological, and four cell classes, types i through iv, were defined on the basis of cell shape, apical specialization and organelle ultrastructure  <cit> . further studies in rodents have reported many functional and gene/protein expression differences, which has led to a functional classification of taste cells that also correlates with some distinguishing morphological features. thus, glial-like taste cells, or type i cells, express enzymes for inactivation and uptake of transmitters  and may participate in salty transduction  <cit> . receptor cells, also called type ii cells, express taste receptor and intracellular signaling proteins  involved in sweet, bitter and umami transduction and can release atp to potentially communicate with afferent nerves  <cit> . type iii cells are presynaptic cells, the only type to form classical synaptic contacts with afferent fibers, and evidence indicates that they transduce sour stimuli  <cit> . cells immunoreactive for ncam, serotonin and synapse-related proteins, such as the target snare protein snap- <dig>  are primarily of this type  <cit> . taste buds also contain round cells restricted to the basal areas  that are thought to represent undifferentiated precursors for the mature cell types  <cit> .

the challenge facing the adult taste system is to maintain optimal numbers of morphologically and functionally diverse cell types, and appropriate cell-cell and cell-afferent nerve interactions, so that sensory function is stable while cellular replacement is ongoing. in particular, cell proliferation must be balanced with taste cell type specification and maturation, incorporation into functional circuits, and ultimately, cell death. the mechanisms that coordinate these ongoing processes are not well understood. among the important unknowns are the source and properties of the regenerative cells. developmentally, taste bud cells arise from the local epithelium, rather than neuroectoderm or neural crest, and recent fate mapping studies have shown that sonic hedgehog -expressing cells in mid-gestation embryos have the properties of taste cell progenitors  <cit> . however, shh-descendent taste cells disappear early in adult life and, consequently, progenitor populations in developing and mature mice may be different  <cit> . as far as the adult epithelium is concerned, there is disagreement about whether long-term progenitors are located extragemmally or within taste buds. based on immunohistochemical and lineage tracing experiments, keratin14-immunoreactive cells in the basal epithelial layer are thought to represent a bipotential progenitor cell population giving rise to both taste cells and surrounding keratinocytes, with the level of the transcription factor sox <dig> believed to be critical for this cell fate decision  <cit> . on the other hand, some studies suggest that the long-term progenitor population is among the basal type iv cells within the taste bud  <cit> , and even "mature" taste cells may themselves divide and contribute new taste cells  <cit> . a similar lack of consensus prevails regarding cell lineages of mature taste cell types and which types undergo death and replacement  <cit> . however, it is generally agreed that at the end of a limited lifespan, taste cells are dismantled by apoptosis, involving activation of p <dig>  bax and caspase  <dig>  <cit> .

although many specifics remain unknown regarding taste cell replacement, inferences based on mechanisms known to couple cell proliferation and differentiation in other vertebrate cell lineages would suggest that the proximate genes that regulate this process are likely to include those that control the cell division cycle. progenitor cell division is driven by mitogenic extracellular signals, such as growth factors, of which many are expressed in adult taste buds  <cit> . these signals alter the expression or activity of proteins that constitute the core cell cycle machinery, including cyclin-dependent kinases , which trigger different phases of the cell cycle  <cit> , and proteins that regulate cdk activity positively  or negatively   <cit> . the cdk inhibitors, and in particular the cip/kip family member p27kip <dig> , have been shown to be important in timing the onset of cell cycle withdrawal during cell differentiation  <cit> . defects due to loss of p <dig> function, including increases in both cell number and organ size, and gain of function defects, such as reduced cell number, support the importance of this protein in arresting mitosis in various organs of the body  <cit> . interestingly, although several cdk inhibitors from the ink <dig> and cip/kip families have been detected in taste epithelium in vitro  <cit> , immunohistochemical studies in adult rodent taste buds have indicated that p <dig> is the primary member of its cdk inhibitor family to be expressed in taste buds  <cit> .

in the present study, we examined the effects of a p27-null mutation on the process of taste cell replacement in the lingual papillae of the mouse. to gain insight into the mechanisms regulating turnover of taste cells, we asked if the absence of this cdk inhibitor alters precursor cell availability, and whether this influences the size of buds and/or the numbers of taste cells they contain. we also asked whether this mutation alters the representation of the major functional classes of taste cells. our results indicate that p <dig> is an important factor regulating taste cell turnover. in its absence, the rate at which new cells appear in the taste bud, and the rate at which cells die, are substantially increased, while taste bud size and structure remain unaltered.

RESULTS
taste bud number and size in p27-null mice
we initially compared tongue tissues from p27+/+ and p27-/- mice using routine morphological techniques. the distribution and number of fungiform  papillae on the dorsal anterior surface was assessed by stripping the superficial epithelial layer and mounting it flat for microscopic examination. in these preparations, the location of each papilla is evident as a gap in the tissue. as seen in figure 1a and 1b, the arrangement and pattern of these structures is similar in tongues of both genotypes. the total number of papillae, and by inference the number of taste buds, is virtually identical in each group . the number of fg papillae in these mice  is very close to that reported for related strains of mice .

analogous data were obtained for the circumvallate  papillae of wild-type and p27-nullizygous mice. viewed in thick plastic sections, these papillae appear very similar . the overall thickness of the mutant stratified epithelium is comparable to that of the wild-type, and contains morphologically typical taste buds distributed in a single row on opposite sides of the papillary cleft. quantitative assessment of taste pores in serial sections indicates that the number of buds per papilla is essentially the same in the two types of animal . the total number of cv buds in these mice  is also similar to previously reported mouse cv taste bud number .

to determine taste bud size and the relationship between taste cell number and bud volume, whole-mount preparations of the epithelium  from the anterior tongue were stained and viewed by confocal microscopy . the single taste bud in each fg papilla was scanned in its entirety for counting taste bud cells, using immunolabeling with the troma- <dig> antibody against cytokeratin  <dig> to visualize bud boundaries and the nuclear stain to-pro- <dig> to identify all nuclei located inside the boundaries. the relationship between taste cell number and bud volume in fg papillae is indistinguishable in the two genotypes, indicating that average cell size is the same in both cases . furthermore, the range of taste bud volumes was the same for mutant and wild-type animals. thus, despite a 15-20% increase in overall tongue dimensions , the number, size and distribution of taste buds themselves are unaffected in p27-null mice.

increased taste cell turnover following p <dig> ablation
because of the established role of p <dig> as an anti-proliferative factor, we examined the effect of p <dig> loss on cell cycle progression within cv taste buds. double-labeling with anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen  and troma-i antibody demonstrates that, as expected, in wild-type mice cycling cells are restricted to the basolateral perigemmal region of the papilla . this pattern is also evident in mutant papillae , indicating that the mutation does not disrupt nor displace the dividing cell population.

to evaluate s-phase progression specifically, p27+/+ and p27-/- mice were injected with the synthetic thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine  and their cv papillae analyzed by immunohistochemistry  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days later for uptake of analogue into dna. by our counting criterion, labeled cell nuclei are seldom observed within taste buds of wild-type animals on day  <dig> post-injection; however, brdu-positive nuclei in mutant buds are significantly more frequent . an almost two-fold difference in intragemmal cell labeling is seen at both days  <dig> and  <dig> . by day  <dig>  however, labeled nuclei are rare in both groups, and the difference between them has disappeared.

these results suggest that, although increased numbers of cells are initially generated in p27-null mutants, cell elimination processes equilibrate the numbers that survive to day  <dig> in the taste buds of the two genotypes. to assess this, we compared cell death in cv papillae of wild-type and mutant mice using the tunel assay, in which end-labeling of the large number of fragments generated during dna degradation in apoptosis can be visualized histochemically. in wild-type taste buds, positively-labeled nuclei or nuclear fragments are occasionally observed ; however, in mutant papillae these structures occur more often, with at least one example per taste bud . also, in electron micrographs, more apoptotic bodies are evident in specimens from p27-/- mice . quantitation at the light microscope level of the frequency of pyknotic cells containing apoptotic bodies within taste buds  indicates that these structures are seen 50% more often in mutants, as compared to normal tissues . together, these data indicate that there is an increase in cell turnover in mutant taste buds.

functional marker protein expression in p27-/- mice
to assess whether the increased turnover rate in mutants affects the proportions of cells in each functional class, we examined expression of ntpdase <dig>  plcβ <dig> and snap- <dig> in sections of wild-type and mutant cv papillae using immunohistochemistry. the labeling patterns observed for these marker proteins are qualitatively indistinguishable between the genotypes in distribution and intensity . counts of plcβ2-labeled cells, whose borders are easily identified in these sections, produced means of  <dig>   and  <dig>   labeled cells per taste bud profile in wild-type and mutant mice, respectively.

labeling with antibodies to ntpdase <dig> or snap- <dig>  on the other hand, did not demarcate individual cell boundaries adequately for quantitation of immunoreactive cells. to overcome this technical limitation, we developed an enzymatically dispersed cv papilla preparation in which individual epithelial cells and small clusters of these cells can be visualized and more easily distinguished from one another. figure 7a comprises representative images of preparations that have been labeled with antibodies directed against ntpdase <dig>  plcβ <dig> and snap- <dig>  in small clusters from p27+/+ and p27-/- mice, cells containing each of the three marker proteins are evident. counts of cells labeled for each protein in three preparations from each genotype demonstrate that the percentage of labeled cells containing ntpdase <dig>  plcβ <dig> or snap- <dig> is virtually identical in mutant and normal papillae . thus, an appropriate representation of these different cell types is maintained in mutant taste buds.

p <dig> expression in taste cells
in several neuronal systems, p <dig> is upregulated in development coincident with the transition from proliferating to differentiating states. to assess when in the life cycle of a taste cell p <dig> is expressed, we employed birth-dating analysis. wild-type mice were injected with brdu and their cv papillae examined  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days later for cells immunoreactive for both brdu and p <dig>  at one day post-injection, essentially no co-labeled cells are found . brdu-labeled cells are restricted to the basal epithelial layer, while p27-labeled cells are observed only within the taste bud itself. however, at day  <dig>  when a substantial number of brdu-expressing nuclei are present in the bud, roughly a third of these nuclei also express p <dig>  by day  <dig> after injection, over half of the newly-generated intragemmal cells co-label for p <dig>  subsequently, there is a slight decline in the percentage of brdu-labeled cells that are p27-immunoreactive at  <dig> days.

double-labeling for p <dig> and each of the three marker proteins was carried out in dispersed cell preparations of wild-type cvs and evaluated using confocal microscopy . p27-immunoreactive nuclei were found in many plcβ2-expressing cells, as well as in some snap-25-expressing cells. however, we were not able to demonstrate co-localization of p <dig> and ntpdase <dig> in these preparations.

discussion
in this study, we examined the consequences of p <dig> gene inactivation for maintenance of adult lingual taste buds. to date, p <dig> is the only member of the cip/kip family of cdk inhibitors known to be produced by taste cells  <cit> . given the important anti-proliferative role played by this cell cycle regulator in other sensory and neural systems, and the effects on tissue organization that result from disruption of its corresponding gene  <cit> , we predicted that absence of p <dig> would have consequences for taste cell number and/or taste bud size. our experiments, however, show that loss of a functional p <dig> gene produces little in the way of overall structural changes in the taste epithelium. this lack of an overt phenotype, nevertheless, belies substantial alterations in taste cell turnover.

one alteration we see is a greater proliferation of precursors in taste epithelium of p27-/- mice. brdu incorporation studies reveal a 2-fold increase in the number of s phase-labeled cells within mutant taste buds during the first week after brdu injection. evidence to date has generally supported the view that taste cell precursors arise from progenitors that lie outside of the taste bud and enter the bud in an immature state, as basal cells, to undergo maturation . within this framework, our data indicate that, in mutants, more precursor cells are entering taste buds per unit time. this interpretation is consistent with results obtained in other systems indicating that p <dig> participates in regulating the timing of cell cycle exit, and, in this role, determines in part the number of cells that will go on to differentiate  <cit> . clearly, p <dig> is not the only factor important for cell number determination, as cell cycle exit and differentiation do continue to take place in its absence. recent in vitro studies of mrna expression have identified other regulators that are present in the taste epithelium and thus are candidates for a role in contributing to, or partially substituting for p <dig> in, supporting these processes  <cit> .

in parallel with an increase in the number of taste cell precursors incorporated in p27-/- taste buds, we observed an elevated level of cell death in mutant buds. this was initially evident as a decline of brdu-immunopositive cells from twice as many as in wild-type buds at day  <dig>  to an equal number at day  <dig> post-injection. it was also confirmed by direct measurement of significantly greater numbers of apoptotic bodies in mutant taste buds. thus, the fact that there are no overall changes in taste bud size and cell number with this mutation could be explained by a coincident change of equal magnitude in these two processes, which would be expected to counteract each other. although measurements of apoptotic bodies in mutants indicate only a 33% increase in the steady state number of dying cells, compared to a 100% increase in the number of brdu-labeled cells, direct comparison of the two measures is not necessarily warranted. apoptotic bodies represent only those cells caught in the brief final stages of apoptosis, which are typically removed quickly from the tissue; newly generated, brdu-labeled cells, on the other hand, persist for much longer. our counts, therefore, very likely underestimate the amount of ongoing cell death in taste buds, as well as the relative change in this process in mutants. together, our findings imply that removal of p <dig> from the system results in a state of chronically high cell flux through the taste buds.

increased apoptosis in p27-/- taste buds can be interpreted as a homeostatic response to an increased input of precursors into buds , due to an enhanced production of cells by taste progenitors. in this view, as long as the cell death machinery is intact, taste buds are capable of autonomously regulating their cell numbers, independently of progenitor proliferation rate. however, loss of p <dig> could additionally or alternatively be influencing cell death directly. in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells in vitro, deletion of p <dig> increases the number of cells that undergo apoptosis, indicating that this cdk inhibitor normally has a survival function in these cells  <cit> . if p <dig> plays a similar role in the taste system, a null mutation could promote cell death and induce the requirement for enhanced generation of replacement cells to maintain the taste bud . in either case, our results suggest that taste buds may be subject to growth compensation, and that there are global mechanisms at work to regulate the size of taste buds within strict parameters  <cit> .

our experiments combining brdu birth-dating with immunolabeling for p <dig> define more precisely the association of p <dig> up-regulation with the initiation of phenotypic maturation in taste cells. in the newly generated population, p <dig> is expressed strongly after about three days post-injection. others have reported that the period between  <dig> and  <dig> days post-injection sees the onset of expression of various proteins associated with phenotypic and functional maturity, including the signaling molecules gustducin  <cit>  and plcβ <dig>  <cit> , the synapse-related snap- <dig>  <cit> , cytokeratins  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and t1r <dig>  <cit> . peak expression of these molecules has been reported to occur at about 6- <dig> days post-injection  <cit> ; in our experiments, the percentage of brdu-labeled cells that were immunoreactive for p <dig> continued to increase to day  <dig> 

interestingly, however, while high levels of p <dig> expression are temporally associated with cell maturation, the protein is present in less than 50% of brdu-labeled cells at any time. theoretically, this limited expression could reflect restriction to a particular stage of cell maturity, or to a discrete cell type . in the present studies, we observed p <dig> co-expressed along with either plcβ <dig> or snap- <dig>  proteins which are mostly present in receptor and presynaptic cells, respectively  <cit> . on the other hand, we could not verify co-labeling for p <dig> in ntpdase2-positive cells, which are likely to be type i cells  <cit> . the simplest interpretation of these data is that p <dig> expression is restricted to and maintained in maturing and mature cells in the bud, excluding the glia-like supporting cell population. curiously, this is distinctly different from the pattern observed in the peripheral visual and auditory systems. here, although p <dig> is expressed in nearly all cells at the time of differentiation, including sensory cell precursors, maintained expression of p <dig> in adults is limited to the mature supporting/glial populations  <cit> .

the reason for sustained, high expression of p <dig> in certain groups of taste cells and not others is unclear. there is evidence in developing neuronal systems that different cdk inhibitors may time cell cycle exit in distinct subsets of progenitor cells that give rise to different cell types  <cit> . this raises the possibility that mature non-p27-expressing taste cells arise from a progenitor population in which a different cdk inhibitor performs this function. the cip/kip family member p <dig> is also expressed in mouse taste buds, but p21-labeled cells represent only a small fraction of taste cells  <cit> , and thus seem unlikely to correspond to the large population of non-p27-expressing cells we see in the bud. a possible role for other cdk inhibitors  in this regard requires further investigation. also, in non-gustatory sensory systems, the cells that continue to express p <dig> in adulthood generally retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate in response to injury or other pathological conditions, a process which includes down-regulation of p <dig>  <cit> . while mature taste cells are generally considered to be post-mitotic, evidence for a small fraction of cycling cells within buds has recently been reported  <cit> , suggesting that in some circumstances certain taste cells may retain this ability. thus, it is possible that one role of this cdk inhibitor is to generally restrict cell cycle reentry in functionally mature cells. however, we found little evidence for ectopic cell division within taste buds of p27-null animals, again suggesting that if p <dig> plays such a role, it is not acting alone.

while p <dig> is clearly important in taste bud turnover, our data indicate that it does not have a direct role in determining taste cell fate. triple-label immunohistochemical studies show that lack of p <dig> does not alter the proportion of cells that label for each of three functional cell type marker proteins. this finding is in agreement with the general consensus in developing systems that the role of p <dig> is restricted to regulating cell number and not cell differentiation  <cit> . in our studies, the dispersed cv papilla preparation proved a reliable method for phenotypic evaluation of taste cells by immunolabeling. in quantifying the differential labeling, we found that the variability was low within groups as well as between the two groups of animals, and that the proportions of differentially-labeled cell types we found were broadly within the ranges that would be expected, based on data from intact mouse cv  <cit> . importantly, we did not find any double-labeled cells in these preparations, indicating that the antibodies we used labeled distinct taste cell populations.

overall, these studies demonstrate, for the first time, that the developmentally important cell number regulator p <dig> also plays a role in the regenerative cell system of adult mouse taste buds. given its demonstrated importance in several developing sensory systems, it seems likely that p <dig> might function in the developing taste epithelium as well. however, lack of the protein from birth does not ultimately alter the number or organization of taste papillae, buds or cells. nonetheless, because in adults the protein seems largely to regulate the dynamics of taste cell life cycles, a similar effect may be evident as alterations in developmental timing and, consequently, sequencing of events leading to a functional peripheral taste system. defining the role of p <dig> in the development of this system is the object of our continuing studies. finally, the implications of chronic increase in cell flux through the taste bud for gustatory function, and for maintenance of the taste epithelium in aging animals, are unclear. resolution of these questions also awaits future study.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that p <dig> plays an important role in the dynamics of taste cell turnover. germline loss of p <dig> leads to enhanced generation and entry into taste buds of undifferentiated cells, consistent with a function for the protein in timing cell cycle withdrawal in taste cell progenitors. however, this increase in the availability of potential taste cells is offset by an enhanced rate of cell death. it remains undetermined whether excess cells that enter the bud all go on to differentiate, or if they are eliminated as immature cells. the overall result is no change in taste bud size or cell number. thus, regulatory mechanisms presumably exist at the level of the tissue to ensure that bud dimensions are ultimately constrained.

in contrast to its involvement in regulating cell cycle exit, p <dig> does not appear to play a role in taste cell differentiation. up-regulation of the protein corresponds temporally with taste cell maturation, and it is only expressed in subsets of type ii and type iii cells, and apparently not at all in type i cells. despite this differential expression, loss of gene function does not perturb the relative proportions of cell phenotypes.
