BACKGROUND
the brassicaceae family includes approximately  <dig>  species in  <dig> genera with diverse characteristics, many of which are of agronomic importance as vegetables, condiments, fodder and oil crops  <cit> . the genus brassica contains the majority of crop species of brassicaceae family. of particular importance are the cole crop and vegetable species b. rapa, b. oleracea, b. napus, and b. juncea as sources of oils and vegetables. because of their agricultural importance, genome components of several brassica species have been characterized in detail over the past few years  <cit> . the genomes of three diploid species, b. rapa , b. nigra , and b. oleracea , have been shown to contain triplicate homologous counterparts of corresponding segments in the arabidopsis genome due to whole-genome triplication that occurred approximately 12– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . additional natural allopolyploidization events in the last  <dig>  years, have resulted in the creation of three allotetraploid hybrids, b. juncea , b. napus  and b. carinata   <cit> . b. juncea is used as a vegetable in china and southeastern asia, and is a source of oil in india and europe. the species possesses unique traits that include much wider morphological variation in leafy types, root type, stem type, seed stalk type and oil type  <cit> . b. juncea has been reported to contain higher glucosinolates than other brassica species  <cit> . glucosinolates are of higher value to human nutrition that may reduce the risk of cancer incidence. in addition, they are toxic to some soil-borne plant pathogens, hence, accounting for their selection  <cit> .

the recent accomplishment of genome sequencing and annotation of b. rapa <cit> , combined with the available genome sequence data for model arabidopsis in brassicaceae <cit> , provide improved strategies for comparative genome analysis and breeding. attempts to develop a unified comparative genomics system in the brassicaceae have revealed  <dig> conserved genomic blocks  <cit> , an extension to the  <dig> syntenic blocks identified in b. napus <cit> . comparative mapping studies between members of brassica and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , and arabidopsis thaliana and capsella rubella <cit> , together with the identification of an ancestral karyotype   <cit> , have stimulated interest in the evolutionary processes underlying diversification in the brassicaceae. since the allotetraploid species possess much larger genomes than their diploid counterparts in brassica <cit> , we expect that novel gene/pathway interactions have emerged in the allotetraploid brassica species through sub-functionalization and/or neo-functionalization of paralogs  <cit> .

low coverage genome survey sequences  can provide information about gene content, polymorphism, functional elements, repetitive elements and molecular markers  <cit> . in some studies, most of the coding sequence in a genome can be surveyed with less than  <dig> genome coverage  <cit> . it was possible to recover 38% of the coding fraction of the mouse-human alignment with only  <dig>  × coverage of the pig genome  <cit> . with only  <dig>  × coverage, it was possible to generate a considerable amount of biologically useful information and genomic resources for megaselia scalaris, including identification of repetitive elements, the mitochondrial genome, microsatellites and identification of gene homologs  <cit> . these studies make a compelling case for low density sequencing in the genomic studies of non-model species.

here, we employed high-throughput sequencing for comparative genome analysis of b. juncea and b. rapa to identify genome changes associated with polyploidization that might account for the phenotypic diversity of b. juncea. we showed clues of glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathway evolution occurred in brassica juncea, likely accounting for some of the phenotypic diversity that is observed. furthermore, it provides a valuable resource for more focused investigations into the rate and distribution of genomic changes that accompany polyploidization in this species.

RESULTS
karyotype of b. juncea
according to the 'u-triangle’ theory of brassicaceae <cit> , allotetraploid b. juncea originated from hybridization of b. rapa  and b. nigra . we identified genomic components of b. juncea by genomic in situ hybridization . the two predicted genomes  of the allotetraploid were distinguished using genomic dna from b. rapa and b. nigra as probes representing the putative progenitor genomes. the  <dig> a and  <dig> b chromosomes detected suggest that the two genomes have remained somewhat distinct in b. juncea with no significant genome homogenization and no large-scale translocations between genomes .

comparative genome analysis of b. juncea and b. rapa
after quality evaluation of sequencing data , a total of  <dig>  gb high quality data were collected for the b. juncea genome and used to compare with whole genome sequence of b. rapa. it was feasible to map  <dig> % sequences of the b. juncea gss data to the genome sequences of b. rapa. of these, only  <dig> % single-end reads were mapped to the genome sequences of b. rapa, which indicated more sv in the b. juncea genome compared to b. rapa. the identity of mapped sequences is  <dig> %, which shows a close genetic relationship between b. juncea and b. rapa . the coverage depth and distribution on chromosomes suggest a high comparison ratio over the b. rapa genome .

polymorphism analysis identified  <dig> , <dig> snps, including  <dig> % transitions,  <dig> % transversions and  <dig> % heterozygosity. we showed the distributions of snp-type in  <dig> chromosomes of b. rapa genome .  <dig>  svs were detected as insertions and deletions, with approximately even distributions of svs across the  <dig> chromosomes of b. rapa genome .  <dig>  indel  polymorphisms were also observed, of which 1 bp-sized indels were most abundant in genome and 3 bp-sized indels were most abundant in coding sequence . most snps and svs  were located in exon, intron, transposon, intergenic, teprotein, tandemrepeat region of genome, others were found in mirna, trna and snrna coding regions of genome . these snps cause a relatively high ratio of non-synonymous mutations in genes; for example,  <dig> genes were found with  non-synonymous snps. moreover,  <dig> genes coding regions were changed by frame-shift indels, and we also found  <dig> genes have sv within gene coding regions . a number of gene functions were found to be altered by these mutations based on non-redundant nucleotide database , cluster of othologues groups proteins database  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database  database searches . here, we have focused on glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathways in particular.

glucosinolate biosynthesis genes expression between b. juncea and b. rapa
we constructed glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway in b. juncea by kegg analysis. three biosynthesis pathways were identified from different substrates including methionine, branched-chain amino acid and aromatic amino acid . among glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes, we found non-synonymous snps and deletion/insertion sv polymorphisms in cyp79f <dig> , cyp83a <dig>  sur <dig> , ugt74b <dig> , sot <dig> , cyp79a <dig>  cyp83b <dig>  cyp79b <dig> and cyp79b <dig> genes , which suggested different genes expressions and glucosinolate components and contents. gene expression of  <dig> selected glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes were investigated in leaves between b. juncea and b. rapa. cyp83a <dig>  cyp79a <dig> and cyp79f <dig> expressions were up-regulated in b. juncea than b. rapa. cyp83b <dig> expression was down-regulated in b. juncea than b. rapa. there was no difference in cyp79b <dig> and sur <dig> expressions between b. juncea and b. rapa . these mutations appear to cause differences in gene expression and glucosinolate content between b. juncea and b. rapa.

the flowering pathway in brassica juncea
flowering behavior is an essential feature affecting brassicaecae crop production. for b. rapa , seed vernalization and long-day photoperiod conditions are necessary for flowering , while only long-day photoperiod conditions promote b. nigra flowering, without any need for vernalization treatment . interestingly, long-day photoperiod conditions lead to flowering in b. juncea regardless of vernalization conditions . we identified four flowering loci c  genes and other flowering pathway-related genes, including constans , constans -like , flowering t , leafy, soc <dig>  and ap <dig> , in b. juncea. under vernalization and long-day photoperiod conditions, when flcs gene expression is down-regulated, flowering occurs by an flc-dependent pathway in b. juncea. under non-vernalization and long-day photoperiod conditions, flowering occurs by a constans-dependent pathway, not flc-dependent, since flcs genes are still expressed during flowering . these results indicate that vernalization- and photoperiod-dependent flowering pathways coexist in the allotetraploid b. juncea .

discussions
allotetraploid b. juncea possesses unique traits that influence its utility as a vegetable crop in china and oil crop in india; these features emerged after natural hybridization between b. rapa and b. nigra and allopolyploidization. the a genome   <cit>  and c genome  <cit>  sequences were recently completed, providing considerable momentum in molecular genetic studies of brassica. brassica a/b/c genome phylogeny and evolution is of considerable interest. largely because of the vast phenotypic diversity available within the brassicas <cit> .

the fate of duplicated genes can be defined as sub-functionalization, neo-functionalization or non-functionalized after polyploidization or whole genome duplication  in polyploid crops  <cit> . biased gene expression between homologous gene is usually observed in allopolyploid plants, including gossypium <cit> , arabidopsis <cit>  and tragopogon <cit> , resulting from genetic and epigenetic interactions between redundant genes, and these interactions can influence plant phenotypes and evolutionary fates of polyploid types  <cit> . among the many models that attempt to explain how/why duplicated genes are retained after polyploidy  <cit> , sub-functionalization is the most popular hypothesis even though it remains controversial  <cit> . genome plasticity, redundancy and diversity are well described and discussed in polyploid brassicaceae <cit> , and are thought to contribute to adaptive phenotypic variation  <cit> . for example, flowering time variation is affected by the replicated copies of the flowering time gene flc in brassicaceae <cit> . here, we preliminarily show that vernalization-dependent and photoperiod-dependent flowering pathways coexist in allopolyploid b. juncea, suggesting that the flowering pathways of b. rapa and b. nigra can express in independent vernalization environments in the allopolyploid b. juncea. timing of flowering onset is an essential trait that affects crop production and plant life cycle. to meet the challenges of climate changes and adapt to a wider range of growing environments, plants adjust their flowering time or pathway during evolution. the coexistence of vernalization-dependent and photoperiod-dependent flowering pathways might indicate better adaptation for survival during evolution in b. juncea. on the other hand, with global warming, b. juncea may have more potential to be used as oil crops because of its flowering trait independent of vernalization status.

in this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing approach based on illumina/solexa platform to investigate 30 × genome survey sequences of b. juncea. after comparison to b. rapa genome,  <dig> % genome survey sequences of b. juncea can be mapped to b. rapa genome, which indicate relative far phylogenetic relationship between a/b than a/c. this provides an opportunity that we can sequence this genome by diploid approaches. after comparative genome analysis between b. juncea and b. rapa, we find more sv in b. juncea genome, which may be resulted from polyploidy event. moreover, based on the 30 × genome survey sequences of b. juncea, we observed huge polymorphisms between b. juncea and b. rapa including snps, svs and indels. the non-synonymous snps, frame-shift indels and genes with svs resulted from these polymorphisms caused a large number of pathways to be changed in b. juncea by kegg analysis, for example, glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway. higher expressions of cyp83a <dig> and cyp79f <dig> genes are associated with a higher content of aliphatic glucosinolate in b. juncea than b.rapa. increased cyp83b <dig> gene expression is associated with a higher content of indole glucosinolate in b.rapa than b. juncea. however, we did not observe a higher content of aromatic glucosinolate resulting from observed higher expression of cyp79a <dig> in b. juncea than b. rapa. that may be reason that we did not observe higher expressions of sur <dig> downstream of cyp79a <dig> and cyp79b <dig> in aromatic glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway in b. juncea. the advent of high-throughput sequencing  has revolutionized genomic and transcriptomic approaches to biology. these new sequencing tools are also valuable for discovering, sequencing and genotyping not only hundreds but thousands of markers across almost any genome of interest, even in species in which little or no genetic information is available  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we find the clues of glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathways evolution in b. juncea based on comparative analysis between 30 × genome survey sequences of b. juncea and genome of b. rapa, which allow us to propose that polyploidization resulted in the evolution of glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathways in b. juncea. the genome survey sequencings promote the whole genome sequencing processing in b. juncea. to conclude, next-generation sequencing, even low genome coverage is pushing forward the molecular genetics especially in non-model plant.
