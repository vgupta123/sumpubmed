BACKGROUND
eukaryotic rrnas contain a large number of nucleotide modifications including 2'-o-methylation and pseudouridylation which are directed by box c/d snornas and box h/aca snornas, respectively  <cit> . these modifications are usually found in the conserved core regions of rrnas, and they play important roles in ribosome function  <cit> . snornas are among the most numerous and functionally diverse non-coding rnas currently known  <cit> , existing widely in eukaryotes including human  <cit> , plants  <cit> , yeasts  <cit>  and protists  <cit> , as well as in archaea  <cit> . this indicates that they are ancient molecules that arose over 2- <dig> billion years ago  <cit> . in addition to guiding the posttranscriptional modifications of rrnas in eukaryotes and archaea, snornas also interact with spliceosomal rnas  <cit> , trnas  <cit> , sl rnas in trypanosomes  <cit> , and at least one brain-specific mrna in mammals  <cit> . recently, snorna u <dig> was found to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer  <cit> . the existence of substantial numbers of orphan snornas indicates that snornas also participate in diverse biological processes that remain to be identified  <cit> .

snornas exhibit canonical sequence motifs and structural features. box c/d snornas carry the conserved box c  and d  motifs near their 5' and 3' termini, respectively. additionally, the variants of the c and d boxes, designated c' and d' box, are usually present internally  <cit> . box h/aca snornas possess a hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail secondary structure and two conserved sequence motifs, box h and box aca. the hinge region contains the h box  and the tail consists of the aca box located  <dig> nt before the 3' end  <cit> . the snornas exert their functions by base-pairing with their targets and recruit related proteins to the sites of modification  <cit> . box c/d snornas can form 10- <dig> basepairs  with multiple cellular rnas. the methylated nucleotide in the target rna is usually positioned  <dig> nt upstream of the d or d' box of the snornas, the so called "d/d'+5" rule  <cit> . in box h/aca snornas, two short antisense sequences in one or both of the two hairpin domains form 9- <dig> basepairs with rrna sequences that flank the target uridine to be converted to pseudouridine. the pseudouridine is always located  <dig> to  <dig> nt upstream from the h box or the aca box of the snorna  <cit> . these structural and functional features of box c/d and h/aca snornas provide the parameters for identifying snornas and their function.

the genomic organization of snorna genes displays great diversity in different organisms. in vertebrates, almost all snorna genes are located in the introns of host genes, with a few exceptions, such as u <dig> which are independently transcribed  <cit> . in plants and trypanosomatids, snorna genes are present in polycistronic clusters which encode both c/d and h/aca snornas  <cit> . a particular genomic organization, the intronic gene cluster, was first found in rice and then in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . moreover, a unique genomic organization  has been characterized exclusively in plants  <cit> . the genomic organization of snorna genes differs largely in fungi. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, apart from seven intronic snorna genes, the majority of snorna are encoded by independent genes as well as five polycistronic snorna gene clusters  <cit> . in contrast, most box c/d snorna genes from the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe are intron-encoded. this raises the question about the genomic organization and expression modes of snorna genes in the fungus kingdom. it is well known that multicellular fungi dominate the population of fungi. however, little is known about snornas in multicellular fungi. it was thus of interest to determine the snorna genes from a multicellular fungi to shed light on these characteristics.

neurospora crassa is a filamentous fungus sharing key components with animal cells in cellular physiology and genetics, contributing to the fundamental understanding of the genome defense system, dna methylation, post-transcriptional gene silencing, cellular differentiation and development  <cit> . as a model eukaryote, the genome of n. crassa has been completely sequenced  <cit> . however, only four box c/d snornas, snr <dig>  snr <dig>  snr <dig>  snr <dig>  were annotated in n. crassa . recently, we identified three u <dig> snorna genes from n. crassa; each of them is independently transcribed and contains a small intron  <cit> . it is evident that the majority of the n. crassa snornas remain to be identified. meanwhile, a comparative genome analysis between yeast and multicellular fungi will provide insights into the evolution of snorna genes in the fungus kingdom. in this study, by combining computational and experimental methods, an extensive analysis of snorna genes from n. crassa was performed. here, we present the first comprehensive list of two major families of snornas from n. crassa , and further discuss the characteristics and evolutionary significance of the snorna genes.

RESULTS
identification of  <dig> box c/d and  <dig> box h/aca snornas from n. crassa
we initially carried out the genome-wide analysis of snornas from n. crassa by employing the snoscan  <cit>  and snogps programs  <cit> . from this database search,  <dig> box c/d and  <dig> box h/aca snorna candidates were predicted . to validate the snorna candidates and identify more novel snornas from n. crassa , the box c/d and box h/aca snorna-specific library of n. crassa were respectively constructed from mixed-stage mycelium and spores using anchored primers . to exclude the highly abundant clones and enrich the novel rna species in our analysis, the radiolabelled oligonucleotides were used to screen the cdna libraries . subsequently, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> clones from box c/d and box h/aca snorna libraries were sequenced, respectively. taken together,  <dig> snornas including  <dig> box c/d  and  <dig> box h/aca snornas  were identified. twenty eight box c/d snornas from the cdna library were covered by the snoscan results. however, only three h/aca snornas overlapped with snogps results. because the data from the computational search of h/aca snornas may include excessive false-positive candidates, they were not included for further analyses in this study.

a all the box h/aca snornas were numbered according to the order of identification. b len, cdna length of the snorna. c chr, chromosomal location of snorna gene. d exp, expression situation. c, n, r, snorna was identified by cdna library, northern blotting analysis, and reverse transcription analysis, respectively. e gp, guide position. g ir, intergenic region. the data for s. p snornas were cited from luo   <cit> . "undet" indicates that the snorna has not been identified in the human genome although the corresponding modification site was detected. abbreviation: s. p, s. pombe; s. c, s. cerevisia; a. t, a. thaliana; h. s, h. sapiens.

the snorna candidates identified by cdna cloning or the snoscan program were subsequently confirmed by northern blot and/or reverse transcription analyses. the expression of  <dig> box c/d and all  <dig> box h/aca snornas were positively detected as expected . among these snornas, the sequence of cd <dig> snorna obtained from the cdna cloning appears uncompleted; it corresponds to the second half of cd <dig> full-length which is further validated by the northern blotting.

in most cases  the c and d boxes in snornas are highly conserved when compared to the consensus sequence . however, the c' and d' box are nonconserved and exhibit much more sequence-degeneracy than their c and d box counterparts. in some instances, the c' and d' box cannot be unambiguously inferred as a result of the absence of the functional region. generally, the box c/d snornas from n. crassa are similar to their metazoan and yeast counterparts in size. however, the sizes of box h/aca snornas from n. crassa are peculiar. almost all of them are larger than  <dig> nt , reminiscent of some irregular box h/aca snornas in s. cerevisiae. these observations show that the n. crassa snornas have their own unique sequence and structural features .

functional properties of the n. crassa box c/d and box h/aca snornas
based on the modification rules of snornas  <cit>  ,  <dig> box c/d snornas from n. crassa were predicted to direct  <dig> methylations. these include  <dig> methylations on rrnas which comprise  <dig> methyls on 26s rrna,  <dig> methyls on 18s rrna and one methyl on  <dig> s rrna . the remnant seven methylations consist of four methyls on snrnas and three methyls on trnas . furthermore, the structure and function elements of u <dig> which participate in the processing of pre-rrna were unambiguously identified. interestingly, two different methylated sites were predicted to be guided by the same functional element of a single snorna cd <dig>  two box c/d snornas  lack the sequences complementary to either rrnas or snrnas and therefore belong to orphan snornas. fourteen box h/aca snornas were predicted to guide  <dig> pseudouridine sites of rrnas , and no pseudouridine sites on snrnas were predicted. the remaining six box h/aca snornas were also classified into an orphan snorna family lacking functional region complementary to rrna, trna or snrna. a different modification pattern appears in n. crassa as compared to the two yeasts s. cerevisiae, and s. pombe  <cit> .

interestingly, a novel snorna, cd <dig>  possesses two guide elements that can form duplexes with u <dig> snrna and  <dig> s rrna for 2'-o-methylation. primer extension mapping of 2'-o-methylated nucleotides of the u <dig> snrna and  <dig> s rrna in the presence of low concentration of dntps resulted in stop signals at the g <dig> and a <dig> residues, indicating that u2-a <dig> and  <dig> s-a <dig> are methylated . we have identified cognates of cd <dig> in other filamentous fungi, however, these cognates only possess the guide sequence for the methylation of u <dig> snrna. this suggests that cd <dig> evolves from the snorna with a single guide function. this is reminiscent of the human small cajal body-specific rnas  that can guide modification of the rna polymerase ii-transcribed snrnas such as u <dig> snrna. the comparative analyses revealed that cd <dig> and its homologs in fungi have one functional element similar to that of human scarna <dig> which was first known as z <dig> , and therefore was homologous to this human scarna. in addition, we characterized a multi-function box c/d snorna, cd <dig>  in n. crassa . cd <dig> has the potential to direct a methylation in u <dig> snrna, and two methylations in 18s and 26s rrnas, respectively . interestingly, the cd <dig> is also partially similar to mgu6- <dig> in mammals  <cit> , but possesses a novel function that can guide a n. crassa-specific methylation on 26s rrna at a <dig> 

genomic organization and expression of the snornas in n. crassa
the genomic organization of the snorna genes in n. crassa exhibits great diversity. among the  <dig> box c/d snornas, forty five snorna genes are intron-encoded in protein-coding or non-coding host genes. the remaining nine were found in the intergenic regions with a putative polymerase ii promoter upstream and appeared independently transcribed. meanwhile, six gene clusters that only encode box c/d snornas were identified from n. crassa . interestingly, an exon-encoded snorna  was identified in the snorna gene cluster iii in contrast to another two intron-encoded snornas  in the same cluster . of  <dig> box h/aca snorna genes,  <dig> are located in intergenic regions and two are intron-encoded. in particular, two snorna genes  are located in the 3' utr of two hypothetical protein genes, one of which is similar to phosphoglycerate mutase. obviously, different strategies dominate in the expression of the two families of snorna genes in n. crassa .

in accordance with the mode of one snorna per intron in vertebrates  <cit> , a large proportion of the box c/d snorna genes  are located within introns of the host genes. the distances from the intronic snorna genes to the 3' splice sites of introns, which has been proven to be important for the effective processing of intronic snornas from their host mrna precursors  <cit> , resemble those in d. melanogaster  <cit> . the distances from the snorna genes to the 5' splice sites appear to mainly be between  <dig> to  <dig> nt, similar to those in human <cit>  .

remarkably, five  of the six box c/d snorna gene clusters arehighly conserved between yeast and n. crassa . although these host genes were not well annotated for their introns and exons in the n. crassa genome, canonical intron splicing sequences were observed flanking every cluster of snorna genes. to further confirm this observation, the mature rna transcripts were identified with the expected sizes by cloning and sequencing of rt-pcr products. it is worth noting that two snorna genes, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in the cluster v are validated to be co-transcribed by rt-pcr and sequencing, though each of the snorna genes in the cluster has a putative promoter upstream. intriguingly, the putative promoter upstream of cd <dig>  a homologue of u <dig>  would play a role in guaranteeing and promoting the function of u <dig> that has been demonstrated vital in diverse eukaryotes. our results further revealed that the genomic organization of the host genes for these five clusters is most like the uhg gene in animals. the host genes of cluster i to v only contain short open reading frames with length ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, suggesting the little potential for protein coding just like the gas  <dig>  <cit> .

unexpectedly, various alternative splicing events were found in the processing of polycistronic transcripts from the snorna gene clusters i and ii by analyzing cdna sequences from rt-pcr of the transcripts . in cluster i, two alternatively spliced transcripts, differing by the absence of exon  <dig> or exon  <dig> plus exon  <dig> were detected. the pattern of alternative splicing in the expression of cluster ii was contingent on an alternative 3' splice site that allows the lengthening or shortening of exon  <dig> 

discussion
high diversity of post-transcriptional modification predicted by snornas in fungi
identification of guide snornas in diverse organisms can provide valuable information towards understanding rna modification patterns and their function  <cit> . it is interesting to compare the pattern of modifications on target rnas of n. crassa to those described in the two yeasts, s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. among  <dig> methylations predicted by the guide snornas in n. crassa ,  <dig> represent the most highly conserved modifications shared by the multicellular fungi and the yeasts, and  <dig>  are modifications that have not yet been reported in other fungi when compared with the two unicellular yeasts. in the yeasts, only ten and eight methylations are s. cerevisiae-specific and s. pombe-specific, respectively. our results imply a more complex modification pattern in multicellular fungi than in unicellular yeasts. they also reveal the high diversity of post-transcriptional modification of rnas in the fungus kingdom as it has been shown that about 40% of methylations are species-specific in a protozoan trypanosoma  <cit> . the species-specific modifications highlight the different modification patterns and their peculiar importance. although eliminating a single modification does not have a dramatic effect on the ribosome  <cit> , loss of three to five modifications in an intersubunit bridge of the ribosome  impairs growth and causes broad defects in ribosome biogenesis and activity  <cit> . on the other hand, early studies have demonstrated that ribosome modifications play roles in determining antibiotic resistance or sensitivity  <cit> . thus the species-specific modifications have potential use in finding therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of diseases caused by some eukaryotic pathogens.

another interesting observation in this study was the presence of duplexes between box c/d snornas and trnas . duplexes between trna and snornas have been also found in c. elegans  <cit>  and recently in plasmodium falciparum  <cit> . trna modification guided by snornas has been also reported in archaea  <cit> . this study provides for the first time a prediction of fungal snornas and their potential target sites in trnas, although these remain to be confirmed by further experiments.

structural and functional evolution of snornas in fungi
our study demonstrates the extensive separation and recombination of functional regions occurring during the evolution of snorna genes in fungi. for instance, the cd <dig> snorna in n. crassa possesses two conserved guiding elements. in s. cerevisiae, however, the conserved function of cd <dig> is executed by two independent snornas, snr <dig> and snr <dig>  with a single functional element  <cit>  . this suggests that cd <dig> may have evolved as a double-guide snorna through recombination of two different halves of two ancestral single-guide snornas. the other possibility is that a gene duplication of a double-guide snorna gene in s. cerevisiae led to specialization of each paralog to only target one modification site followed by loss of the other guide element for both paralogs. another example is cd <dig> and cd <dig> that carry a conserved guiding function for u <dig> and u24b in s. pombe, respectively. in contrast, the u <dig> in s. cerevisiae has two guiding functions. comparative analyses revealed that the structure and function of u <dig> are well conserved among the budding yeast and the flowering plants a. thaliana and rice, but the homologues of the s. cerevisiae u <dig> exist as two independent snornas in other distant eukaryotes, such as human and mouse  <cit> . this suggests that u <dig> snorna gene has evolved in two pathways, with one leading to a dual functional snorna gene and the other separating the guiding functions and giving rise to two independent snorna genes.

it has been demonstrated the reciprocal evolutionary change between snorna complementary region and their rrna target sequence in plants and nematodes <cit> . our analyses indicate that co-evolution between snornas and rrnas exists widely in n. crassa  and plays an important role in preservation of phylogenetic conserved methylated sites of rrnas which is essential for protein synthesis.

rip may impact on the generation of snorna isoforms by gene duplication and transposition
snorna gene isoforms or variants exist widely in diverse organisms, particularly in plants. for example,  <dig> box c/d snornas with a total of  <dig> different gene variants were identified in the a. thaliana genome  <cit> , and  <dig> gene variants encoding  <dig> box c/d snornas were found in oryza sativa  <cit> . compared with the plant snornas, only a paucity of yeast snorna paralogs was detected because of a relatively small compact genome . the n. crassa genome  is three-fold larger than that of the yeast; however, most snorna genes in this species are singleton. why are the snorna genes devoid of isoforms in the n. crassa genome? it is known that a mutagenic process termed repeat-induced point mutation  has a profound impact on n. crassa genome evolution, which has greatly slowed the creation of new genes through genomic duplication and resulted in a genome with an unusually low proportion of closely related genes  <cit> . of the predicted  <dig> protein-coding genes, only six pairs  share >80% nucleotide or amino-acid identities in their coding sequences  <cit> . rip identifies duplications that are greater than ~ <dig> bp  and induces c:g to t:a during the sexual cycle  <cit> . early studies have provided clear evidence of retrotransposons inactivated by rip  <cit> . the analysis of the n. crassa genome sequence also revealed a complete absence of intact mobile elements  <cit> . therefore the creation of new genes including snorna genes or their host genes through gene duplication and transposition seems to be impeded. it has been proposed that most, if not all paralogs in n. crassa duplicated and diverged before the emergence of rip  <cit> . we have identified three u <dig> snorna gene variants, ncu3a, ncu3a- <dig> and ncu3a- <dig> in n. crassa . the sequence analysis revealed that these molecules have undergone nucleotide substitutions rather than rip according to the calculation method previously reported  <cit> . in the case of cd46a and cd46b, we speculate that the two snorna gene isoforms may have duplicated and diverged before the emergence of rip.

alternative splicing in the expression of non-coding rna genes with introns
it is well known that alternative splicing is an important and widespread process where one gene produces more than one type of mrna which is then translated into different proteins in multicellular organisms  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis indicates that 35-65% of human genes are involved in alternative splicing, which contributes significantly to human proteome complexity  <cit> . however, alternative splicing is rarely reported for non-coding rna genes which encode multiple introns. in this study, we identified several alternative splicing events that occurred in the processing of rna precursors transcribed from the snorna gene cluster i and ii of n. crassa. it has been reported that the mouse gas <dig> gene, a non-coding rna and snorna host gene, had four alternative splicing transcripts  <cit> . although different in snorna composition, the snorna gene clusters in n. crassa are most like uhg genes resembling gas <dig>  our results show that alternative splicing occurs frequently in the expression of snorna host genes in lower eukaryotes. this lends support to the concept that alternative splicing may be an ancient mechanism in regulating the expression of both protein-coding and non-coding rna genes with introns. more work is necessary to elucidate the biological significance of the alternative splicing in the expression of non-coding rna genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report the first extensive identification of box c/d and box h/aca snornas from the filamentous fungus n. crassa using a combination of computational and experimental method. the repertoire characteristics, targets, genomic organization and the unique function of the n. crassa snorna genes were extensively compared with those of potential orthologues in close and distant organisms such as s. pombe, s. cerevisiae, a. niger, m. grisea, a. thaliana and h. sapiens . our results improve annotation of snorna genes in the n. crassa genome, an important model filamentous fungus, and provide insights into the characteristics and evolutionary significance of the snorna genes in the fungus kingdom.
