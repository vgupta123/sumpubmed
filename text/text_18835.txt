BACKGROUND
fatty acid  hydroperoxides are intermediates in different oxylipin pathways controlling plant development  <cit>  and plant responses to stresses  <cit> . to date, much of the research on oxylipin signals has focused on jasmonic acid  whose biosynthesis starts with the peroxidation of linolenic acid  mediated by 13-lipoxygenase  enzymes. in nicotiana attenuata, silencing of lox <dig>  a gene coding for a 13-lox isoform, considerably reduces the accumulation of herbivory-induced jasmonic acid and as a consequence, the accumulation of several direct defense compounds, such as nicotine and trypsin proteinase inhibitors, as well as terpenoid volatiles that function as indirect defenses  <cit> . consistent with its important regulatory role in mediating responses to herbivory, lox <dig> expression increases after herbivore attack  <cit> .

in n. attenuata, one of the transcripts most strongly elicited by the feeding of different herbivores is an α-dioxygenase , a gene homologue of nicotiana tabacum  α-dox  <cit> . the ntα-dox was first identified as a pathogen inducible oxygenase  sharing significant homologies with mammalian prostaglandin endoperoxidases  <cit> . α-doxs are fa-hydroperoxidases which target the α-carbon  of a broad range of fas  <cit> . in vitro, their catalytic activity is characterized by the production of long-chain aldehydes formed from α-hydroperoxy-fa molecules that escape reduction to α-hydroxy-fa and undergo spontaneous decarboxylation  <cit> . like loxs, α-doxs also use linolenic acid  as substrate, but convert it to heptadecatrienal  in vitro. however, quantification of the oxidative products of α-dox activity in response to bacterial inoculation, revealed that 2-hydroxy-c18: <dig>  is the major product synthesized in tobacco plants  <cit> . because 2-hot exhibits antimicrobial activity at high concentrations, it may directly protect plants against pathogen attack  <cit> . however, the biological functions of this and other α-dox products remain largely unknown.

several lines of evidence indicate that α-dox genes are involved in responses to different abiotic and biotic stresses. in tomato roots, for example, ethylene increases α-dox transcript accumulation during salt stress  <cit> . other abiotic stresses, such as uv-b exposure, heavy metal stress, and cold stress, increase α-dox transcript accumulation in nicotiana longiflora, rice and arabidopsis, respectively  <cit> . however, more work has examined whether α-dox is involved in a plant's response to pathogens and herbivores. in capsicum annuum transcripts of an α-dox homolog increase during pathogen infection  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana and n. tabacum, the transcriptional up-regulation of α-dox is amplified when the infection results in a hypersensitive response  <cit> . ponce de león et al.  <cit>  showed that α-dox gene expression is impaired in salicylic acid -compromised plants and transgenic a. thaliana plants silenced in α-dox expression do more rapidly develop severe necrotic lesions in response to incompatible bacteria than do wild-type  plants. this suggests that α-dox <dig> activity protects tissues from excessive necrosis; however, the responsible mechanisms remain unknown.

in n. attenuata, the effects of pathogen inoculation and treatment with pathogen-derived elicitors on n. attenuata α-dox transcript accumulation is much weaker than that of its homologues in other species  <cit> . the strong transcriptional up-regulation of n. attenuataα-dox in response to herbivore attack involves the initial perception of fatty acid amino acid conjugates , which are herbivore specific elicitors in the oral secretions  of lepidopteran larvae  <cit> . in addition, the up-regulation of α-dox requires the ja-signaling pathway as demonstrated by the lack of α-dox transcript accumulation in os-elicited lox3-silenced plants  <cit> . ja elicitation of α-dox transcripts has also been reported in oryza sativa  <cit>  and n. tabacum  <cit> . this regulation suggests an anti-herbivore function for naα-dox in n. attenuata.

generally, the increased transcription of α-dox genes in plants attacked by herbivores and pathogens suggests a defensive function; however, plant α-dox transcripts and activity are also regulated during developmental processes. fatty acidα-oxidation was first reported in peanut seedlings during germination  <cit> . also during germination, one of the first α-dox proteins was isolated in pea. pea seedlings accumulate psα-dox transcripts at much higher levels than do leaves and dry seeds  <cit>  and these are lost during maturation  <cit>  and later detected exclusively in roots. additional evidence for a role in development is suggested by the increasing expression ntα-dox gene during leaf senescence in n. tabacum  <cit> .

fa α-oxidation is phylogenetically widespread, as even preparations from green alga form 2-hydroxypalmic acid from palmic acid  <cit> . the α-dox proteins identified in different plant species show high amino acid homologies. for example, the amino acid sequence of n. tabacum α-dox shares high amino acid similarities with the proteins in n. attenuata , c. annuum , solanum lycopersicum , a. thaliana , and o. sativa   <cit> . in addition to these proteins, referred to as α-dox <dig>  another α-dox isoform exists. a second protein, first identified in tomato and a. thaliana, shares more homology between species than with the corresponding α-dox <dig> sequence of the same species. this second protein, encoded by α-dox <dig>  is the s. lycopersicum feebly gene, which leads to a dwarf phenotype in a knock-out mutant  <cit> . the patterns of α-dox <dig> transcript accumulation differ from those of α-dox <dig> in both s. lycopersicum and a. thaliana. whereas α-dox <dig> transcript accumulation is not increased by pathogen infection, it is enhanced in seedlings and in wilting leaves  <dig> to  <dig> days after detachment  <cit> . despite a similar transcriptional regulation of α-dox <dig> in s. lycopersicum and a. thaliana, its role in plant development appears to be species-specific. ectopic expression of the atα-dox <dig> in a tomato mutant deficient for α-dox <dig> partially complemented the compromised growth phenotype, but deletion of atα-dox <dig> did not result in a growth phenotype  <cit> . in summary, although α-dox proteins are widespread across the plant kingdom their specific functions, presumably in defense and development, remain to be elucidated.

to determine the role of the herbivore responsive α-dox <dig> gene in n. attenuata, we used agrobacterium mediated plant transformation with an inverted repeat  construct to silence its expression. more than half of the lines showed a severe dwarf growth phenotype, the other lines developed similarly to wt plants. though the α-dox activity was reduced in all lines, it was not detectable in those lines exhibiting a dwarf phenotype. to test whether this resulted from a co-silencing of a second α-dox isoform in the dwarf phenotype lines, we used a consensus sequence of α-dox <dig> isoforms in l. esculentum and a. thaliana to clone a gene fragment of the n. attenuata α-dox <dig> gene. the dwarf phenotype correlated with the co-silencing of the naα-dox <dig> gene. in contrast to naα-dox <dig>  naα-dox <dig> transcripts were not induced by wounding or simulations of manduca sexta attack. instead, α-dox <dig> was more expressed in roots and flowers. to investigate the functions of both isoforms, we transiently silenced both with gene specific constructs using virus induced gene silencing  and examined the consequences for plant development and constitutive and induced phytohormone levels.

RESULTS
silencing naα-dox in n. attenuata results in two growth phenotypes
to examine the function of naα-dox <dig> , we transformed n. attenuata with an ir construct containing a  <dig> bp fragment of naα-dox <dig> to silence its expression . two distinct growth phenotypes were observed:  <dig> of the  <dig> independently transformed lines showed stunted growth , whereas the other lines showed a mild phenotype  and were indistinguishable from wt plants in their growth and development. plants of the irα-doxs lines germinate normally though a higher proportion of infertile seeds were produced by these plants. young irα-doxs seedlings appear similar to wt plants, but already when transplanted into soil two weeks after germination, they are slightly delayed in development. at rosette stage, approximately  <dig> days after germination, irα-doxs plants are clearly delayed with rosette diameters of about a third of that of wt and irα-doxm plants . at flowering, approximately  <dig> days after germination, irα-doxs plants only attained one fourth to a third of the height of wt plants and produced only few flowers . whereas wt n. attenuata plant in  <dig> l pots produce between  <dig> and  <dig> capsules, homozygous irα-doxs plants usually produce between  <dig> and  <dig> capsules. the α-dox activity was reduced in all irα-dox lines. however, whereas irα-doxm plants showed a reduction of around 40% in α-dox activity, only very low or no activity was detectable in dwarf irα-doxs plants . the accumulation of the main product of α-dox in planta: 2-hot was reduced by more than 50% in irα-doxm plants compared to wt and was at the detection limit in irα-doxs plants .

a α-dox <dig> isoform in n. attenuata is co-silenced in the irα-dox lines
in s. lycopersicum and a. thaliana a second gene with high sequence similarity to α-dox <dig> was identified  <cit> . the phenotype of tomato plants mutated at this slα-dox <dig> locus  is very similar to that of the irα-doxs plants  <cit> . a southern-blot analysis performed by hermsmeier et al.  has already demonstrated that n. attenuata's genome contains at least two α-dox gene copies. we therefore investigated whether a homologue of s. lycopersicum and a. thaliana α-dox <dig> may also be present in n. attenuata and may have been co-silenced in the irα-doxs plants. we used a consensus sequence of α-dox <dig> isoforms in s. lycopersicum and a. thaliana with low sequence identity to the n. attenuata α-dox <dig> gene to design primers to amplify a putative naα-dox <dig> gene. we amplified a sequence and cloned it into escherichia coli. subsequently, a  <dig> bp gene fragment  of the naα-dox <dig> was sequenced from  <dig> independent clones. by comparison of this gene fragment to a custom data base of the complete n. attenuata transcriptome we identified a cdna sequence of naα-dox <dig> of  <dig> bp . the translated amino-acid sequence deduced from this sequence clusters in a phylogenetic tree of plant α-dox sequences close to the α-dox <dig> isoforms in s. lycopersicum and a. thaliana but apart from n. attenuata α-dox <dig> .

by sybr green-based real-time -pcr with gene specific primers for naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> , transcript accumulation of both genes was determined in irα-doxm and irα-doxs plants after repeated treatment with m. sexta os to puncture wounds, a treatment known to strongly induce naα-dox <dig> transcription  <cit> . transcript accumulation of naα-dox <dig> was reduced by 40% in irα-doxm and by 85% in irα-doxs plants of wt levels . moreover, in irα-doxs plants transcript accumulation of naα-dox <dig> transcripts was reduced by 70%, whereas irα-doxm plants had naα-dox <dig> transcript levels comparable to those of wt plants . thus, the dwarf phenotype of irα-doxs plants is correlated with a concomitant silencing of the naα-dox <dig> isoform in conjunction with a stronger silencing of the naα-dox <dig> gene.

distinct transcriptional regulation of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox2
to evaluate the roles that naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> play during development we analyzed transcripts of both genes in various tissues of developing n. attenuata plants. both genes show strong tissue specific differences in their transcript abundance . in n. attenuata leaves, transcripts of both naα-dox genes accumulate with plant and leaf maturation resulting in highest transcript levels in senescing leaves. in leaf tissues, naα-dox <dig> transcripts are generally more abundant than naα-dox <dig> transcripts. though this difference was only significant in the young rosette leaves, the same tendency was observed in stem leaves, rosette leaves , and senescing leaves. the difference between the two naα-dox genes was more pronounced in roots, flower buds, and flowers, but in these tissues naα-dox <dig> transcripts were much more abundant than those of naα-dox <dig>  in brief, naα-dox <dig> expression is increased in roots, during flower formation, as well as during leaf maturation and senescence, but only the latter process also enhanced naα-dox <dig> transcripts.

as both naα-dox genes have a similar transcriptional regulation during normal leaf maturation, the question arises, whether the naα-dox <dig> is also regulated during herbivore attack as is known for the naα-dox <dig> gene in the leaves of n. attenuata. therefore, we compared the inducibility of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> transcript accumulation by wounding and herbivore specific elicitors. by sybr green-based rt-pcr gene specific transcript accumulation of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> genes was determined in wt n. attenuata plants after repeated treatment with m. sexta os to puncture wounds. as known from previous studies  <cit>  transcript accumulation of naα-dox <dig> is increased significantly by wounding and is further up-regulated by the treatment of the wounds with m. sexta os . interestingly, the naα-dox <dig> gene does not respond to wounding or to the application of m. sexta os.

co-silencing of both naα-dox genes increases constitutive levels of aba, ja and anthocyanins
we measured phytohormone levels in leaves to characterize the metabolic consequences of silencing either naα-dox <dig> or additionally naα-dox <dig>  we quantified levels of ja, abscisic acid  and sa because previous studies indicated that α-dox is involved in the physiological processes mediated by these phytohormones. the major signaling molecule in herbivore induced responses, ja, has been shown to be required for α-dox <dig> expression in n. attenuata  <cit>  and levels of aba and sa have been reported to regulate α-dox expression in arabidopsis and tomato plants  <cit> . the irα-doxs plants that were co-silenced for both naα-dox isoforms showed strongly increased levels of the phytohormone aba, but the irα-doxm plants did not . in 39-days old rosette stage plants, we found an almost 3-fold increase in constitutive aba levels and a slight increase in constitutive ja levels  in irα-doxs plants compared to wt. similarly, constitutive levels of sa were increased in irα-doxs plants compared to wt .

because the retarded growth phenotype of the irα-doxs plants is already evident at the seedling stage, we also measured anthocyanins in the seedling stage. anthocyanins are general indicators of stress responses and thought to be involved in a stress signaling response via reactive oxygen species   <cit> . in seedlings of an irα-doxs line, levels of total anthocyanins were more than five-fold higher than wt levels  <dig> and  <dig> days after germination started . seedlings of a second irα-doxs line had anthocyanin levels increased by more than 10%  <dig> days after sowing. the increase in anthocyanins in irα-doxs lines compared to wt seedlings was significant .

consequences of silencing naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> individually and concomitantly
to disentangle the single and combined effects of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> silencing we created gene-specific silencing constructs and transiently silenced naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> separately and in combination using vigs and examined growth parameter. that vigs constructs were gene specific was confirmed by real time pcr for naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> genes in vigs plants . to compare vigs of naα-dox <dig> with stably transformed in irα-doxm lines and to irα-doxs lines we inoculated in addition to wt also irα-doxm plants with the empty vector  and the vigs construct to specifically silence naα-dox <dig>  stable and transient silencing of only naα-dox <dig> as well as transient silencing of only naα-dox <dig> did not affect plant growth, but the additional silencing of naα-dox <dig> in a stable line silenced for naα-dox <dig> resulted in stunted growth . thus, vigsα-dox <dig> in irα-doxm transformants resembled the growth phenotype when both genes were co-silenced in stably transformed irα-doxs lines.

to investigate the role of naα-dox genes in the plant response to herbivory, we analyzed phytohormones regulating physiological processes that α-dox has been associated with and induced nicotine accumulation in the plants transiently silenced for either naα-dox <dig> or naα-dox <dig> or both. further, we accessed the contribution of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> to constitutive and m. sexta-induced 2-hot production. constitutive 2-hot levels were significantly reduced in plants silenced for naα-dox <dig> or naα-dox <dig>  with the strongest reduction in plants silenced for both genes. herbivory by m. sexta significantly increased 2-hot levels. this induction was compromised in all plants silenced in naα-dox <dig>  but silencing only naα-dox <dig> accounted for a minor reduction in herbivory-induced 2-hot .

the key hormone for responses during pathogen infection salicylic acid  was not significantly affected by the feeding of m. sexta but by the expression of α-dox in the transformed lines . sa tended to be reduced in all α-dox silenced plants with and without herbivory by m. sexta, however, this trend was only significant for the comparison between wt plants inoculated with vigsev and vigsα-dox <dig> 

feeding by m. sexta significantly increased aba levels . constitutive and m. sexta-induced levels of aba are significantly enhanced in plants silenced for both naα-dox genes . silencing naα-dox <dig> decreases m. sexta-induced aba levels, as aba levels in vigsα-dox <dig> plants were significantly lower compared to vigsev wt plants and the same tendency was observed in vigsev in irα-doxm plants . as expected, ja levels were strongly increased in response to m. sexta feeding . the levels of induced ja were lower in plants transiently and stably silenced only for naα-dox <dig> compared to vigsev wt , but not in those silenced for α-dox <dig> . plants silenced for both naα-dox genes had higher levels of ja compared to plants silenced for naα-dox <dig> alone, which was already apparent in constitutive ja levels  and did not result from an increased induction after m. sexta feeding. induced nicotine accumulation in vigs plants corresponded well with the observed ja induction pattern and was lower in the plants only silenced for naα-dox <dig>  but not in those silenced for naα-dox <dig> . however, the data with heterogeneous variances were not normally distributed and no transformation for the nicotine data allowed for parametric statistical analysis; the mann-whitney u-test only detected a significant difference between plants silenced for naα-dox <dig> and those silenced for both naα-dox genes  because nicotine levels were highest in the latter plants.

these results indicate that the effects of individual and simultaneous silencing of the two naα-dox genes exhibit opposing effects likely resulting from different causes. whereas stable and transient silencing of the naα-dox <dig> gene weakens the herbivore-induced plant response with respect to ja and aba as well as secondary metabolite production, the silencing of both naα-dox genes, which stunts growth, results in higher constitutive levels of diverse stress-related traits, some of which are likely to also be elicited by herbivore attack.

discussion
the function of the α-dox pathway, which is widespread in the plant kingdom, is poorly understood. here we identify the naα-dox <dig> gene in n. attenuata and demonstrate that α-oxidation of fatty acids plays an important role during its development and that naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> differ in their transcriptional regulation. both genes are transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf maturation and senescence and silencing both genes results in retarded growth of n. attenuata plants. however, the distinct expression patterns of the two naα-dox genes indicate a more important role of the naα-dox <dig> gene during plant development, especially in root and flower development and seedling maturation. the strong transcriptional regulation of naα-dox <dig> in response to herbivory and the reduced induction of ja when naα-dox <dig> is silenced suggest a role in plant defense responses, whereas naα-dox <dig> shows no transcriptional regulation in response to herbivory and its silencing did not change the elicitation of ja. we infer from the different patterns of transcriptional regulation that the two naα-dox genes contribute differently to functions in primary and secondary plant metabolism in n. attenuata.

functional diversification of plant α-dox genes
we identified the naα-dox <dig> gene and obtained a  <dig> bp cdna sequence from a full transcriptome data base of n. attenuata. the naα-dox <dig> likely corresponds to an orthologue of arabidopsis and tomatoα-dox genes with which they share 89% and 79% sequence homology, whereas sequence homology between naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> is 69%. the duplication of α-dox genes likely occurred early in the evolution of eudicots before the split of solanaceae and brassicaceae, since the orthologues between species contain significantly more homologies than do the paralogues within species.

stable transformation of n. attenuata plants with a silencing construct for naα-dox <dig> resulted in two distinct growth phenotypes. whereas growth and development of irα-doxm lines with a ca. 40% reduction of α-dox activity were indistinguishable from those of wt plants, about 60% of the generated lines with low or undetectable α-dox activity were highly stunted . stable transformations were performed before the α-dox <dig> paralogues were known and gene specific real time pcr revealed that these two phenotypes correlated with a dissimilar silencing of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> in the respective lines. whereas irα-doxm plants are reduced in naα-dox <dig> transcript accumulation by 40%, they are not significantly altered in naα-dox <dig> transcript accumulation. irα-doxs lines, on the other hand, are reduced by 85% in naα-dox <dig> and 70% in naα-dox <dig> transcript accumulation. the naα-dox <dig> silencing construct shares 72% sequence similarity with the naα-dox <dig> gene and contains a  <dig> nucleotide match with only one mismatch, which was probably sufficient for the co-silencing of both naα-dox genes in the majority of transformed lines. the stunted growth could either result from a concomitant silencing of both naα-dox genes or the loss of the naα-dox <dig> function alone. the latter hypothesis is consistent with the stunted growth phenotype of feebly  <cit>  and divaricata mutants  <cit>  in tomato, which result from insertional mutagenesis at the locus of the slα-dox <dig> homologue. however, arabidopsis mutants of atα-dox <dig> do not show any developmental abnormalities, indicating that the developmental role of α-dox <dig> may be restricted to a specific clade e.g. solanaceae. alternatively, α-dox functions in n. attenuata may also be distinct from those in tomato, and the stunted growth of in irα-doxs lines is the consequence of an almost complete loss of total α-dox activity due to a silencing of both naα-dox genes.

silencing both naα-dox genes is required to stunt plant growth
by using vigs-constructs specific for naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> we recognized that silencing naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> individually did not affect growth, but silencing both genes concomitantly decreased plant growth. this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the stunted growth phenotype results from a reduction in total α-dox activity and indicates that the α-oxidation activity of the enzymes of both genes can compensate for the loss of function of the other. with in vitro assays, bannenberg et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that tomato slα-dox <dig> and slα-dox <dig> have a similar range of fatty acid substrates and activities. in n. attenuata both naα-dox genes can function in plant development, whereas in tomato the loss of slα-dox <dig> function is sufficient to stunt growth and in arabidopsis the loss of both atα-dox genes does not affect growth  <cit> . the normal growth of n. attenuata plants silenced for naα-dox <dig> by vigs may alternatively be explained by a lower silencing efficiency compared to the slα-dox <dig> tomato insertional mutant, however this seems unlikely given that vigs reduced naα-dox <dig> transcripts by 80% and silencing by stable transformation only reduced transcript levels by 70% in the dwarf irα-doxs plants.

that the stunted growth in stably transformed irα-doxs lines is more pronounced than in the vigs plants co-silenced for naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> is probably due to greater effects of silencing a gene early than later in development. the growth of irα-doxs plants was already delayed two weeks after germination. though we did not observe obvious growth differences between wt and irα-doxs seedlings, the importance of α-dox activity during seedling maturation in n. attenuata is supported by highly increased levels of anthocyanins in irα-doxs seedlings. increased levels of anthocyanins are also described for tomato mutants lacking slα-dox <dig> function  <cit> . the importance of α-oxidation of fatty acids during germination processes is also suggested by the increased transcript accumulation and enzymatic activity of a psα-dox during the first days of germinating pea plants  <cit> . increased levels of anthocyanins and aba are often associated with oxidative stress  <cit>  and levels of aba are also increased in irα-doxs plants. additionally, constitutive levels of the phytohormones ja and sa are increased in irα-doxs plants. thus, strong silencing of both naα-dox genes in irα-doxs plants could have led to severe physiological stress resulting in increased levels of several stress-related metabolites such as several phytohormones. alternatively, higher levels of constitutive phytohormones could be a consequence of less cellular expansion in these lines, rather than specific effects on specific metabolic pathways. none of these changes were observed in irα-doxm plants indicating that a moderate silencing of naα-dox <dig> does not result in comparable physiological stress during development.

both naα-dox genes have overlapping but distinct roles in plant development
transcript accumulation of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> in various tissues of developing n. attenuata plants were determined to characterize their endogenous roles. in roots, transcript accumulation of naα-dox <dig> is very high, whereas it is very low for naα-dox <dig>  which is consistent with previous studies in n. attenuata  <cit>  that found no naα-dox <dig> expression in roots. the root specific expression of naα-dox <dig> distinguishes n. attenuata from pea, arabidopsis and tomato, in which α-dox <dig> is expressed in roots but not α-dox <dig>  bannenberg et al.  <cit>  found no detectable atα-dox <dig> transcripts in roots of arabidopsis and only very low levels of slα-dox <dig> transcripts but high levels of one slα-dox <dig> isoform in tomato roots. in arabidopsis, the atα-dox <dig> promoter is exclusively active in roots whereas the atα-dox <dig> promoter is exclusively active in shoots  <cit> . in pea seedlings, psα-dox is almost exclusively expressed in roots and this gene shares a greater degree of amino acid sequence similarity with ntα-dox <dig> and atα-dox <dig> than with atα-dox <dig>  <cit> . in this regard, the stunted phenotype of irα-doxs lines could also result from silencing naα-dox <dig>  which may have interfered with root development causing the observed growth and stress responses. irα-doxs lines are characterized by a small main root and very few lateral roots; to determine whether this is a cause or a consequence of the dwarf growth, grafting experiments would be required. however, the loss of function of naα-dox <dig> in root development can only contribute to but not cause the dwarf phenotype, as the silencing of both naα-dox genes is required to stunt growth. in n. attenuata, the transcripts of both naα-dox genes accumulate during leaf maturation and natural senescence with levels of naα-dox <dig> exceeding those of naα-dox <dig>  this is in contrast to tomato and arabidopsis, in which atα-dox <dig> and slα-dox <dig> transcripts only accumulate in response to the artificial senescence stimulus of leaf detachment  <cit> , whereas neither α-dox <dig> nor α-dox <dig> genes accumulate in leaves attached to plants. moreover, in contrast to n. attenuata, in which the levels of naα-dox <dig> transcripts exceed those of naα-dox <dig>  in arabidopsis and tomato atα-dox <dig> and slα-dox <dig> transcripts are barely detected in leaves and showed only an extremely weak response to leaf detachment. however, the results in n. attenuata are in line with the increasing expression of naα-dox <dig> gene during natural leaf senescence in n. tabacum  <cit> . we propose that in nicotiana species α-dox genes may be involved in the regulation of senescence, whereas in arabidopsis and tomato increasing oxidative stress in the dying tissue of a detached leaf may be at work. the loss of function of both naα-dox genes during leaf maturation may be involved in the dwarf phenotype of the irα-doxs lines as the overlapping transcriptional regulation of naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig> in leaves corresponds well to the observation that silencing of both genes is necessary to stunt growth.

during flower maturation in n. attenuata, only naα-dox <dig> transcripts accumulate, so that they are twofold higher in mature flowers than in flower buds. consistent with hermsmeier et al.  <cit> , who found no transcripts of naα-dox <dig> in flowers of n. attenuata, we found very low transcript abundance of naα-dox <dig> in flowers. however, in arabidopsis, promoters of both atα-dox genes are active in anthers and the atα-dox <dig> promoter was additionally shown to be active in the ovaries and siliques  <cit> . in distylous species of turnera, a homologue of α-dox <dig> is specifically expressed in short-styled plants  <cit> . interestingly, long chain aldehydes, similar to those generated in vitro by the activity of α-dox proteins, are emitted by many flowers  <cit> ; however, the role of α-dox genes during flower maturation remains unknown and is likely not involved in causing the stunted phenotype.

only naα-dox <dig> is involved in responses to herbivory
the similar regulation of the two naα-dox genes in n. attenuata leaves is restricted to developmental regulation, however in contrast to naα-dox <dig>  the naα-dox <dig> gene does not respond to wounding or the elicitors in the os of m. sexta larvae. in agreement with its up-regulation during herbivory, naα-dox <dig> contributed most to the herbivore-inducible 2-hot level. silencing of naα-dox <dig> by vigs or stable transformation reduced herbivore-inducible 2-hot levels by 60% while silencing only naα-dox <dig> had only a marginal effect. accordingly, we found no effect of silencing naα-dox <dig> by vigs on induced responses to m. sexta herbivory, whereas stable and transient silencing of naα-dox <dig> decreased the m. sexta-induced levels of ja by 30% and tended to decrease induced levels of the direct defense metabolite, nicotine. vigs of naα-dox <dig> also reduced m. sexta-induced aba levels by 25%. thus, naα-dox <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of the plant's response to herbivory, whereas silencing naα-dox <dig> did not affect induced phytohormone levels. vigs of both naα-dox genes concomitantly only increased constitutive levels of ja and aba and strongly decreased constitutive levels of 2-hot which is consistent with the phytohormone phenotype in stably transformed plants co-silenced for naα-dox <dig> and naα-dox <dig>  because plants silenced for both naα-dox genes display the loss of function in development and in the plant's response to herbivory, the specific role of naα-dox <dig> during herbivory should be further investigated using irα-doxm plants and plants silenced by vigs for naα-dox <dig>  a kinetic analysis of ja induction in the naα-dox <dig> silenced plants may reveal potential feedback regulation by 2-hot, as we show here that naα-dox <dig> gene expression is mediated by but also affects ja signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified the α-dox <dig> isoform in n. attenuata and revealed that both naα-dox genes function in development but that only naα-dox <dig> functions in anti-herbivore defense. the conditions that regulate the two α-dox isoforms and the consequences of their loss of function in n. attenuata and other plants share commonalities and clear differences supporting quite divergent functions in different plant species. interestingly, phylogenetic relation is a poor predictor of the regulation of α-dox genes in different plant species , but transcriptional regulation is suggested to determine function of α-dox genes, because the enzymatic activity is largely similar for the α-dox paralogues within species as well as for the orthologes among species. this suggests that the α-dox pathway is a relatively plastic metabolic route in plant primary metabolism which became repeatedly co-opted for specialized functions associated with adaptation to environmental stress. a better mechanistic understanding of the role of α-dox genes during plant development and stress responses will help to explain the differences and seemingly convergent similarities of α-dox regulation in different plant species.
