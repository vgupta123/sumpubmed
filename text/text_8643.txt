BACKGROUND
members of the spirochete genus borrelia in both the relapsing fever and lyme disease agent clades have been found to carry large numbers of linear and circular plasmids that range from  <dig> to over  <dig> kbp in size. these linear plasmids were first observed as dna bands in electrophoresis gels by barbour  <cit> , and both linear and circular plasmids have subsequently been shown to be universally present in borrelia isolates . these plasmids have a number of unusual and interesting features.  the linear plasmids have covalently-closed hairpin ends  <cit> .  the plasmids encode many n-terminally lipidated proteins, many of which are targeted to the outer surface of the bacteria . these proteins are important in interactions between the bacteria and their hosts and are potential vaccine and detection targets.  some of the linear plasmids have an unusually low  density of protein coding genes and harbor an unusually large number of pseudogenes .  a large number of paralogous gene families and paralogous intergenic sequences are present on the plasmids  <cit> .  the previous two observations suggest a tumultuous history of  rearrangements among the plasmids followed by decay of broken and redundant genes .  most of the plasmids are quite easily lost with growth in culture, which can make maintenence of fully virulent strains in the laboratory difficult .  among the plasmids, only cp <dig> is known to be required for growth in culture .  up to nine and probably as many as  <dig> different paralogous versions of the cp <dig> family of circular plasmids can exist in the same cell  <cit> .  a number of the plasmids appear to be prophages or prophage-related  <cit> .  only a few percent of the linear plasmid genes encode proteins with homology to known proteins outside of the borrelia genus, and these include proteins related to previously known plasmid partitioning and maintenance proteins, small molecule transporters, dna restriction-modification systems, as well as nucleotide and dna metabolism enzymes . and finally,  several of the plasmids have been shown to carry genes that are important in mouse and/or tick infection .

electrophoretic linear plasmid dna band patterns of b. burgdorferi isolates are extremely variable, and a given gene can reside on different sized linear plasmids in different isolates . for example, dna from genes b31_k <dig> through b31_k <dig> on b. burgdorferi type strain b31’s lp <dig> plasmid hybridized to plasmids across a 24– <dig> kbp range in palmer et al.’s  <cit>  analysis of a panel of  <dig> north american b. burgdorferi isolates, and this was confirmed by comparison of the b <dig> and  <dig> lp <dig> nucleotide sequences when they were determined  <cit> . on the other hand, several of the b. burgdorferi plasmids, most notably the circular cp <dig> and linear lp <dig>  are present and quite similar in all isolates that have been analyzed  <cit> . finally, all b. burgdorferi isolates that have been examined carry multiple cp <dig> plasmids; these are circular plasmids, usually between  <dig> and  <dig> kbp in length, that are different, but yet are largely homologous throughout their lengths  <cit> . the cp <dig> plasmids are almost certainly prophages  <cit> .

the complete plasmid content of a borrelia isolate is difficult to determine by gel electrophoresis because large dna circles are poorly resolved and because the multiple linear plasmids often have very similar sizes. to date, the complete plasmid complement has been analyzed for only four b. burgdorferi isolates, b <dig>  n <dig>  jd <dig> and  <dig>  which are known to harbor  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> different plasmids, respectively  <cit> . our previous analysis of these four genomes identified  <dig> possible “compatibility types,” suggesting that a rather large menu of such types may be present in b. burgdorferi  <cit> . we note that plasmid compatibility is not well understood in borrelia, and this issue is discussed in more detail below. in order to understand the plasmid diversity within and among the different lyme agent borrelia species, we determined the complete genome sequence of ten additional genetically diverse b. burgdorferi isolates, during which we obtained high quality sequences of nearly all of their plasmids  <cit> . here, we describe the plasmids present in these b. burgdorferi isolates and compare their genetic contents and organizational features.

RESULTS
b. burgdorferi genome sequences reveal new plasmid types
b. burgdorferi sensu stricto plasmid putative “compatibility types”
in addition to those of strains b <dig>  n <dig>   <dig> and jd <dig> which we described previously  <cit> , this study describes and compares the plasmids present in the ten previously unanalyzed b. burgdorferi isolates 64b, 72a, 94a, 118a, 156a,  <dig>  bol <dig>  ca- <dig> a, wi91- <dig> and zs <dig>  whose complete genome sequences were determined by sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing  <cit>  to an average depth of 8-fold as previously described . all the plasmid sequences, with the following few exceptions, were closed and finished to the j. craig venter institute’s “gold standard” of sequence determination: strain 94a plasmid lp28- <dig> and 156a plasmid lp <dig> were not closed due to difficulties in assembling long repeat tracts; one wi91- <dig> cp <dig> sequence was not closed because of assembly difficulties due to regions of high similarity in another cp <dig> present in this strain; and bol <dig> cp32- <dig>  cp32- <dig> and cp32- <dig> sequences were not closed due to their high similarity and to a lack of funds .

the members of this panel of  <dig> b. burgdorferi isolates are from southern new england , southeast new york , wisconsin , california , italy  and germany . they include human, bird and tick isolates, and represent a diverse set of rrna/ospc types . these  <dig> genomes contain  <dig> plasmids of which  <dig> are circular and  <dig> are linear. the individual strains each carry between  <dig> and  <dig> circular plasmids and between  <dig> and  <dig> linear plasmids, with an average  <dig>  total plasmids per isolate. we note that the genome sequences of the three strains that have been studied in the most detail and used most frequently in the laboratory, b <dig>   <dig> and n <dig>  appear to have lost two , one  and one  plasmid, respectively, between their original isolation and genome sequence determination . thus, even though cultures were chosen for sequencing that had been passaged a low number of times in the laboratory, the plasmids sequenced in each strain represent a minimum number for the plasmids that might have originally been present. we also note that since the closed hairpin end-containing fragments of the linear plasmids are not cloned into plasmid-based dna sequencing libraries, an unknown amount of sequence is missing from the termini of most of the linear plasmids. comparison of the terminal sequences with measured terminal restriction fragment lengths , indicates that in most cases the missing sequence is very likely one kbp or less .fig.  <dig> sequenced b. burgdorferi sensu stricto plasmids. the  <dig> completely sequenced genomes shown as columns where shaded cells indicate the presence of a plasmid. for the linear plasmids, different cell colors and roman numerals indicate subtypes; similar colors and numerals in different plasmids  do not imply any relationship. for the circular plasmids light yellow shading marks the cp <dig> plasmids with large deletions, and roman numerals denote the subtype of the cp <dig> and cp <dig> plasmids. no subtypes were defined for the cp32s, so a “ + ” indicates a cp <dig> of that compatibility group is present. “i or ii” denotes plasmids in which unsequenced terminal regions preclude discrimination between subtype i and ii; “fused” indicates that the two so indicated plasmids in affected strains appear to be covalently joined; “∆”, indicates the presence of a large deletion relative to other cp32s, and the associated letters indicate different deletion endpoints ; “inv” indicates a large inversion is present relative to the other cp32s; and parentheses  enclose the one cp <dig> and three cp <dig> plasmids whose sequences were not closed.  rrna igs <dig>  nomenclature according to travinsky et al.  <cit> .  related chromosomal snp  groups according to mongodin et al.  <cit> .  defined in text and fig. 6a below.  ospc type nomenclature of barbour and travinsky  <cit> .  previously named cp32- <dig> and cp32- <dig> have the same compatibility; we use cp32- <dig> to represent this group.  these plasmids are known to have been present in the isolate before sequencing, but were lost in the culture whose dna was used for sequencing.  the lp32- <dig> plasmid likely has the same compatibility type as cp32- <dig> 




the b. burgdorferi plasmids are named according to their putative compatibility type, which is thought to be determined at least in part by the sequence type of the borrelia pfam <dig> protein that the plasmid encodes  <cit> . a large majority of the borrelia plasmids encode a pfam <dig> protein, but the two smallest types - the circular cp <dig> and linear lp <dig> plasmids - do not. the pfam <dig> protein family is homologous to the para proteins of other plasmid partitioning systems  <cit> , and although their role in borrelia plasmid maintenence and compatibility is not yet understood , the  <dig> b. burgdorferi genome sequences and eight genome sequences of other b. burgdorferi sensu lato  species that include full plasmid sequences  contain a total of  <dig> plasmids, and we find that no isolate harbors two or more plasmids with the same pfam <dig> “sequence type” . this strong correlation does not prove, but does lend support to the notion that the pfam <dig> proteins are involved in conferring plasmid compatibility in spite of the fact that they are not always essential. borrelia plasmid naming conventions have been described elsewhere . in this report we use “plasmid type” to refer to the “pfam <dig> type” and “plasmid subtype” to refer to organizational variants within such types.

newly discovered plasmid types
among the plasmids present in the  <dig> newly analyzed genomes we identify three “new” pfam <dig> types that are not present in the four previously analyzed genomes of strains b <dig>  jd <dig>  n <dig> and  <dig>  these plasmids are designated cp32- <dig>  lp28- <dig> and lp28- <dig>  additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows a raxml  <cit>  maximum likelihood tree of the known b. burgdorferi pfam <dig> protein types in which the lp28- <dig>  lp28- <dig> and cp32- <dig> pfam <dig> proteins form robust, well-separated branches . the cp32s present in the previously analyzed complete genome sequences have  <dig> pfam <dig> types  <cit> , and the cp32s present in the ten new genome sequences add only one new cp <dig> type, suggesting that all common b. burgdorferi cp <dig> types are likely now known . three genomes, those of ca- <dig> a, 72a and 118a, contain the twelfth cp <dig> type, cp32- <dig>  which was previously known from directed study of b. burgdorferi strain ca- <dig> cp <dig> partition gene clusters  <cit>  .

two of the new pfam <dig> types are encoded by linear plasmids lp28- <dig> and lp28- <dig>  these are present in isolates 94a and bol <dig>  respectively . their pfam <dig> proteins are robustly separated from other pfam <dig> proteins in maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining trees, but the lp28- <dig> protein is moderately closely related  to its nearest relatives, the lp28- <dig> type pfam <dig> proteins . this lp28- <dig> relationship is slightly closer than the next most different types, the cp32- <dig> and cp32- <dig> pfam <dig> proteins, which are about 76% identical. the latter two must represent different compatibility types since strains jd <dig> and 156a carry both cp32- <dig> and cp32- <dig> plasmids. these observations prompted the new lp28- <dig> type name, and although we believe it is likely a novel type, there is no proof at this point that it is truly a different compatibility type from lp28- <dig> .fig.  <dig> maps of lp28- <dig>  lp28- <dig> and lp32- <dig>  the yellow bars represent the plasmids, and the arrows within them indicate most open reading frames in these plasmids; blue arrows are putative plasmid replication/maintenence/compatibility genes, green denotes vls cassettes and red are other genes. black “x”s on arrows indicate pseudogenes. pfams  <cit>  are indicated in the boxes above, and putative function is noted in red text above the map. an asterisk  marks the putative lipoprotein gene at ~ <dig> kbp of lp28- <dig> that is a homolog of jd1_j <dig> which encodes a closely related putative lipoprotein; these are ~75% identical to plasmid-encoded proteins pgp <dig> and bapko_ <dig> of b. garinii pbi and b. afzelii pko, respectively; this gene has no homolog in the b. burgdorferi type strain b <dig>  the blue bars below note some of the best similarities to other b. burgdorferi linear plasmids




although isolate 94a is the only one of the  <dig> sequenced b. burgdorferi genomes that contains an lp28- <dig> type plasmid, we note that plasmids that encode pfam32’s similar to this lp28- <dig> protein are present in one of two b. afzelii  genomes as well as in the single b. valaisiana  and b. spielmanii  genomes . we have reported that the strain pko lp28- <dig> harbors a bor gene cluster whose products synthesize a peptide that is predicted to be highly posttranslationally modified and is very similar to streptolysin s toxin, and this gene cluster is common the latter three lyme borrelia species  <cit> , so this plasmid type appears to be more prevalent in these species than in b. burgdorferi. the lp28- <dig> plasmid carries a typical cluster of four plasmid replication/partitioning genes and other genes that are typical of the variable “lp28” group of b. burgdorferi linear plasmids; these genes include a pfam <dig> restriction-modification gene, a pfam <dig> lipoprotein gene and vls cassettes . an lp28- <dig> type plasmid is also only present in one of the  <dig> b. burgdorferi genomes analyzed here, but we note that plasmids that encode pfam <dig> similar to this lp28- <dig> are present in our sequences of one b. afzelii  and two b. garinii  genomes . the gene content of bol <dig> lp28- <dig> is very similar overall to the lp28- <dig>  lp28- <dig> and lp28- <dig> group of linear plasmids  <cit> , except that it carries a unique set of partition genes .

before this report, each known pfam <dig> protein type was encoded by either linear or circular plasmids, but not both. however, strains 72a and 118a carry very similar linear plasmid sequences that have a cp32- <dig> type pfam <dig> gene. these two “lp32-3” plasmids . strain b <dig> cp32- <dig> and 118a lp23- <dig> pfam <dig> proteins are  <dig> % identical , and we note that neither 72a nor 118a carries a cp32- <dig> plasmid, in agreement with the notion that pfam <dig> proteins are involved in plasmid compatibility. the two lp32-3 s are syntenic and are extremely similar in nucleotide sequence . they are not syntenic with any previously known plasmid, but carry genes that encode proteins that are similar to members of various borrelia plasmid-encoded pfams. figure  <dig> shows an orf  map of the strain 118a lp32- <dig>  it carries a set of contiguous vls cassettes, several genes whose closest relatives are more typically found on cp32s, including an erp family gene   <cit> . these are arranged in a manner that is not perfectly syntenic with the cp32s. the lp32-3 s also carry regions that are similar to lp28- <dig> and lp <dig> of other strains . both lp32- <dig> partition gene clusters contain pfam <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> protein-encoding genes as is the case with most borrelia plasmids, but curiously both of the pfam <dig> genes in these clusters contain several frameshift mutations; however, there are second, apparently intact, non-contiguous pfam <dig> genes  on the lp32- <dig> plasmids in these two isolates that could perhaps substitute for this frameshifted gene.

the compatibility of different borrelia cp <dig> plasmids has not been studied. the cp9s  contain no pfam <dig> gene, and so cannot be categorized by their pfam <dig> type. we note, however, that the genome sequence of isolate wi91- <dig> appears to contain two cp9s, which must be compatible. all known cp <dig> plasmids encode pfam <dig> proteins which are involved in plasmid replication maintenance, partitioning and/or compatibility in other borrelia plasmids  <cit> , and a maximum likelihood tree of these cp9-encoded proteins shows that the two wi91- <dig> cp <dig> pfam <dig> proteins lie on different major branches, but are nonetheless 87% identical . this difference in sequence could conceivably allow compatibility; however, since the pfam <dig> protein sequences do not naturally divide into robust, very well separated branches as neatly as the pfam <dig> proteins, and the specific role of the pfam <dig> proteins is not known, this idea remains speculative.fig.  <dig> tree of cp <dig> pfam <dig> proteins. a maximum likelihood tree created by raxml using the protgammawag model  <cit>  of the b. burgdorferi cp <dig> pfam <dig> proteins is shown with bootstrap values  above the lines. a fractional distance bar is shown in the lower left, and strain names followed by the protein locus_tags are shown at the right of each branch. the two strain wi91- <dig> cp <dig> plasmids are designated #a and #b . a neighbor-joining tree created by clustalx  <cit>  also places the two wi91- <dig> in different major branches 




thus, the  <dig> different pfam <dig> plasmid compatibility types, in addition to lp <dig>  <cit>  and the two putative cp <dig> types described here make it theoretically possible for a single b. burgdorferi cell to harbor  <dig> different known plasmid types. table  <dig> lists these currently known plasmid types and shows that the presence of these different plasmid types in the  <dig> sequenced genomes varies greatly. the five most common plasmid types are lp <dig>  lp28- <dig>  lp <dig>  lp <dig> and cp26; each of these has a representative in all  <dig> genomes. the least abundant are lp28- <dig>  lp28- <dig> and lp28- <dig>  each of which is present in only one of the  <dig> isolates.table  <dig> plasmid frequencies in  <dig> b. burgdorferi isolates

organizational variants within individual pfam <dig> plasmid types
linear plasmid organizational variability
our previous comparison of the genomes of four b. burgdorferi strains, b <dig>  n <dig>   <dig> and jd <dig>  showed that some plasmids of the same pfam <dig> type are very highly conserved among strains, while others can have major differences in genetic content and organization  <cit> . even the relatively invariant lp <dig> exists as three different subtypes whose gene contents vary within the cluster of tandem pfam <dig> genes near the right end as we have discussed previously . but how many organizational variants of each plasmid type exist in nature? is the number of variants limited, or are rearrangements occurring sufficiently frequently that nearly every new isolate will have uniquely organized plasmids?

we define organizational “subtypes” within each of the b. burgdorferi plasmid types as follows: two plasmids are considered to be of the same subtype if they  are syntenic throughout their lengths,  harbor no >400 bp indels  relative to one another , and  have no obvious past inter-plasmid dna exchanges relative to one another. we name these organizational subtypes with roman numerals, for example lp <dig> subtypes i through vii . we note that the lp28- <dig> and lp <dig> sequences in strain ca- <dig> a appear to be fused end-to-end to form a larger  <dig>  kbp linear plasmid , but they are treated as separate entities for ease of comparison in this report. additional file 1: figure s <dig> presents comparative reading frame diagrams for all  <dig> linear plasmids from the  <dig> b. burgdorferi genomes. it shows the differences between the subtypes and indicates the organizational subtype of each plasmid. there are  <dig> different subtypes among these  <dig> linear plasmids. with the exception of lp <dig>  lp <dig> and lp32- <dig> in which little variation has been observed among the few members known, and lp28- <dig>  lp28- <dig> and lp28- <dig>  each of which is only present once in our strain panel, the linear plasmids in the  <dig> genomes have between two and eight organizational subtypes. figure  <dig> indicates which strains carry which plasmid subtypes, and table  <dig> summarizes the number of subtypes of each pfam <dig> compatibility type are present in our panel of  <dig> isolates.

as examples of the organizational relationships among subtypes, figs.  <dig> and  <dig> show that plasmid lp <dig>  which is present in all  <dig> genome sequences, has seven different organizational subtypes, and lp28- <dig>  which is present in seven of the  <dig> genomes, has five structural subtypes. curiously, all the lp <dig> organizational differences are all present as different sequences at the plasmid left ends. these alternate left-end sequences are not novel, but are instead similar to sequences present in other b. burgdorferi plasmids. as we previously reported, the n <dig> and jd <dig> lp17s  harbor alternate left end sequences that are very similar to two different parts of lp <dig> . for example, bps 300– <dig> of the type ii n <dig> lp <dig> are  <dig> % identical to bps 33169– <dig> of the type i b <dig> lp <dig>  and bps 1574– <dig> of the type iii jd <dig> lp <dig> are  <dig> % identical to bps 10021– <dig> of b <dig> lp <dig>  we show here that in addition, lp <dig> subtypes iv and vi have left end sequences that are very similar to terminal or near-terminal sequences of plasmids lp28- <dig> subtype i and lp28- <dig> subtype ii, respectively; for example, the type iv zs <dig> lp <dig> bps 42– <dig> are  <dig> % identical to b <dig> type i lp28-4 bps 1– <dig>  and, ignoring three deletions in the 94a plasmid relative to the wi91- <dig> plasmid, the type vi wi91- <dig> lp <dig> bps 33– <dig> are  <dig> % identical to the type ii 94a lp28-3 bps 1–3995). we also note that lp <dig> subtype vii has a divergent pfam <dig> gene inserted near its left end . similarly, the five types of lp28- <dig> plasmids all carry vls cassettes and closely related partition gene clusters, but also have very substantial regions of difference that are often very similar to parts of other linear plasmids .fig.  <dig> plasmid lp <dig> organizational subtypes. plasmids are represented as in fig.  <dig>  with different background colors indicating regions of nonhomologous dna. the organizational subtypes  are indicated by roman numerals on the right, and isolates that carry each type are indicated above the maps. some paralogous gene families are indicated in boxes above each map  <cit> , and black bars below indicate some of the similarities to other b. burgdorferi linear plasmids

have all the linear plasmid subtypes been identified? nearly identical plasmids of the same subtype in different isolates are clearly not uncommon, as about half of the linear plasmids belong to subtypes that have more than one member . on the other hand many subtypes are currently represented by a single plasmid . the latter observation suggests that subtype delineation might currently be far from complete, and a large number of additional subtypes might exist. however, a substantially larger fraction of extant plasmid types might be known than such a calculation based on random plasmid distribution would suggest, because the  <dig> strains whose genome sequences we determined were picked to be as diverse as possible and to represent a significant fraction of the spectrum of multilocus sequence , rrna and ospc diversity of b. burgdorferi . if, for example, plasmid contents are fairly constant within each of the different rrna/ospc lineages, then a substantial fraction of the extant plasmid subtypes might be known . on the other hand, some plasmid types and subtypes may be common only in particular geographical regions or in ospc types that have not yet been sampled by sequence determination. analysis of more varied isolates will be required to answer these questions.

linear plasmid gene content in b. burgdorferi isolates
there is substantial variation in the plasmid content of different b. burgdorferi isolates . the fact that many plasmid genes belong to paralogous families means that most isolates carry members of nearly all of the b. burgdorferi gene families . however, the rearrangements that have given rise to the different plasmid subtypes have often placed the most highly related gene pairs on different plasmid types in different isolates. additional file 1: table s <dig> lists the locations of some of the important and better-studied linear plasmid gene types in each of the  <dig> strains. a majority of these genes are found on several different plasmid types. however, in spite of the past duplicative rearrangements that have happened to these plasmids, some genes are typically only present in one copy and always on the same plasmid type, for example pnca  on lp <dig>  and adec  and fbp  on lp <dig>  interestingly, the adec  gene is present and intact on all lp <dig> plasmids, but on plasmid lp <dig> subtype iii , defective adec paralogues have suffered several reading frame disrupting mutations in all seven isolates that carry the latter plasmid. the cspz gene, which encodes a complement regulation protein  <cit> , is typically present in one copy on lp28- <dig>  but in strain wi91- <dig> a second apparently intact copy is on lp <dig>  the cyclic di-gmp binding protein gene  <cit>  is present on two different plasmids, lp28- <dig> subtype v and lp28- <dig> subtype i, in different isolates, and arp  is found on four different plasmid types, lp28- <dig> subtype i, lp28- <dig> subtype iii, lp28- <dig> subtype i and lp <dig> subtype ii . thirteen of the  <dig> strains carry a set of vls cassettes; this region is absent only from ca- <dig> a. the location of the vls cassettes is quite variable, and they lie on five different linear plasmid types that include  <dig> different subtypes: lp28- <dig> , lp28- <dig> , lp <dig> , lp28- <dig>  and lp32- <dig>  . we note that no vlse gene, which encodes a hyper-variable outer surface protein and is modifed by vls cassette sequences , was found in the sequencing libraries of any of the  <dig> strains, most likely because a region between the vls cassettes and the vlse gene region appears to be unclonable in plasmid dna libraries  <cit> . restriction-modification genes are rather plentiful in all but one  of the  <dig> isolates, and 156a and 118a each have four apparently intact plasmid-borne genes that encode such proteins. it is difficult to assess the relevance of the absence of vls cassettes in ca- <dig> a, of cspz in 72a,  <dig> and bol <dig>  or of arp in 64b, bol <dig>  wi91- <dig>   <dig> and zs <dig> due to the ease with which linear plasmids are lost in culture. answers to these questions may have to wait until all plasmid subtypes can be unambiguously delineated for b. burgdorferi bacteria in wild-caught ticks, i. e., conditions in which the bacteria have not been propagated in culture.

circular plasmid organizational variability
there are three general kinds of circular plasmids present in the  <dig> b. burgdorferi complete genomes, the cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> families of plasmids. since only these kinds are found in the  <dig> genomes, additional kinds of circular plasmids, if they exist, must be uncommon. the circular cp <dig> plasmids are organizationally identical in all  <dig> sequenced genomes, and we do not define organizational subtypes for the cp32s. although the latter are syntenic overall, they do have significant gene content differences in their four variable regions  <cit>  and they exhibit a few large indels ; however, homologous recombination appears to have shuffled the combinations of these regions to the point that a majority of the individual cp <dig> plasmids would define a unique “subtype”  <cit> . for example, each of the  <dig> cp32s in strains b <dig>  jd <dig>  n <dig> and  <dig> has a different combination of variable region “alleles”  <cit> . thirteen of the  <dig> fully assembled cp <dig> sequences contain substantial  deletions, and one has a  <dig>  kbp inversion; these are delineated in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and indicated in fig. 1). none of these rearrangements removes any of the partitioning genes or any of the studied “lysogenic conversion” genes that are expressed from these prophage plasmids   <cit> . the  <dig> and 156a cp32-7 s have identical deletions, as do the 118a and 72a cp32-5 s; each of the other nine deletions is unique. since these deletions were likely created by nonhomologous recombination events  <cit> , each of these pairs of identical deletions is almost certainly descended from a single ancestral deletion event .

in addition, two types of cp <dig> rearrangements are found that are not simple deletions or inversions. as previously reported, in strain b <dig> a cp32- <dig> is integrated into an lp <dig> plasmid by nonhomologous recombination  <cit> . the linear lp <dig> present in strain 94a has no such insertion and is  <dig> % identical over about 95% of its length to the non-cp <dig> portion of the b <dig> lp <dig> . thus, the 94a lp <dig> almost certainly represents the parental type of plasmid lp <dig> into which the cp <dig> integrated in strain b <dig>  the second type of cp <dig> rearrangement is fusion between full-length cp32s of different compatibility types; such dimer plasmids are present in strains jd <dig>  zs <dig>  64b and 118a  and their formation appears to have been mediated by homologous recombination, since no novel sequence joints are present. thus, of the cp <dig> sequences,  <dig> have been modified by recent nonhomologous rearrangements, and  <dig> are apparently intact . finally, we note that, since the strain 118a and 72a lp32- <dig> sequences are syntenic and about 99% identical in sequence over most of their length , the ancestral exchange between a cp32- <dig> and a linear plasmid to generate lp32- <dig> most likely happened only once in our strain panel . compared to most of the linear plasmids, relatively few nonhomologous rearrangement events have been involved in generation of the extant cp <dig> organizational diversity.

the circular plasmid type cp <dig> has three organizational subtypes that are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  subtypes ii and iii have about 300 bp of apparently non-protein-coding dna that replaces the b <dig> pfam <dig> revb gene  and subtype iii’s plasmid maintenence/partition gene cluster  is inverted relative the other two subtypes. all three subtypes have apparently intact genes that encode the exported eppa protein .

rare genomic rearrangements  can track borrelia plasmids
the nature and utility of rare genomic rearrangements
as discussed above, b. burgdorferi plasmid subtypes are mosaically related to one another in that they have patchy or mosaic sequence relationships in which two plasmids can have patches of very high sequence similarity  that are adjacent to very different  sequences. these highly related patches are bounded by “novel sequence joints” or “mosaic boundaries.” such mosaic boundaries have been created by rare genomic rearrangements that are apparently mediated by nonhomologous recombination events. we previously discussed the sequences at some specific mosaic boundaries in the b <dig>  n <dig>   <dig> and jd <dig> plasmids , and the numerous new mosaic boundaries discovered here in the plasmids and in the chromosomal right-end extensions of ten new genomes have similar characteristics; i.e., when it can be determined they appear to have been generated by nonhomologous recombination .

we have argued that these linear plasmid rearrangements appear to occur randomly since the novel sequence joints that result are often present within genes, and it seems very unlikely that there is a positive selection for the resulting broken genes . there are 3 ×  <dig> possible different random break and rejoin points or mosaic boundaries that can form when any sequence is rearranged with an identical sequence . therefore, since there are on average about  <dig>  bp of linear plasmids in b. burgdorferi, there are about 3 ×  <dig>  bp =  <dig>  trillion possible different random novel joints can in theory be formed by dna exchanges within the linear plasmids. it seems prohibitively improbable that identical novel sequence joints will be found that were created independently, and we believe that identical novel joints found in more than one isolate are descendants of a single ancestral rearrangement event. by a similar argument, it is also extremely improbable that a random nonhomologous event would be precisely reversed by another such event. in practical terms the extant novel joints, unlike simple base pair changes, very likely happened only once and do not revert precisely .

the rate of these rearrangements relative to the rate of nucleotide substitutions can be estimated. using lp <dig> as an example, we find  <dig> snps in a multiple alignment of  <dig> nucleotides of pfam <dig> genes from the b. burgdorferi genomes. all snps are synonymous except one ile to leu nonsynonymous difference. assuming that all synonymous snps are selectively neutral, the rate of synonymous nucleotide substitution  is estimated to be  <dig>  substitutions per synonymous site by using the program paml  <cit> . using a combination of five genes on lp <dig>  yielded a similar synonymous  substitution rate of  <dig>  per site. among the  <dig> lp <dig> plasmids we identify  <dig> novel sequence joints within their average 17000 bp length . these lp <dig> novel joints are indicated in additional file 1: figure s2b. therefore the rate of rearrangements among these genomes is approximately 11/17000 =  <dig>  mosaic boundaries per base pair on lp <dig>  we thus estimate that nonhomologous rearrangement of lp <dig>  and presumably the other linear plasmids, in b. burgdorferi is substantially less frequent than nucleotide substitution, occurring at a minimum rate of approximately  <dig> %  of the rate of neutral nucleotide substitution. this corresponds to a minimum value for the ratio of their rates of formation, since novel joints seem more likely to be selected against  than simple bp changes; however, our observation that novel joints are often present within genes and should inactivate those genes suggests that they can often be tolerated even when genes are broken during their formation . we also note that homologous recombination between regions of similar sequence among the plasmids could in theory create new combinations of these novel joints at a much faster rate than their rate of formation. the linear plasmid novel sequence joints should serve as excellent genetic markers in the study of b. burgdorferi population structure, possible plasmid exchange and plasmid evolution.

exchange of sequences between linear plasmids and the chromosome
some but not all b. burgdorferi chromosomes have linear plasmid-like sequences between  <dig> and  <dig> kbp long covalently attached to their right ends  <cit> . previously three different terminal attachments of this kind were known, those typified by isolates b <dig>  jd <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . among the  <dig> chromosomes whose sequences are now known, including the  <dig> isolates whose plasmids are newly described here and the chromosome of strain ca <dig> , twelve have right-end extensions that increase the total to six different right-end sequence extensions . all six extension types are composed of sequences that are closely related to linear plasmid sequences. for example, the blue lp28-1-like sequences in fig. 6a, although not all of the same length because of partial replacements in the different strains, are all >99% identical to each other where homologous sequences are present, and the overlapping green lp28-5-like sequences in strains jd- <dig> and 156a are  >99% identical. similarly, the relationships between the chromosome extensions and their “parent” plasmids are very close. for example, the strain b <dig> right-end chromosomal extension  and the strain  <dig> lp28- <dig> homologous regions are >98% identical, the strain  <dig> extension  and b <dig> lp <dig> homologous regions are >99% identical , and the strain jd <dig> extension  and the n <dig> lp28- <dig> homologous regions of are >99% identical. the right ends of strains 156a, 118a and ca- <dig> a typify three new types; 94a and 72a right ends are the same as ca- <dig> a, and 118a is similar to ca- <dig> a, but its terminal sequence has suffered an ~ <dig> kbp inversion. if assumptions are made that  the ancestral state had no plasmid-like sequences joined to the chromosome , and  the novel sequence joints between the plasmid-like and resident chromosomal sequences were created when the plasmids recombined  with the chromosome, several possible sequences of major events can be deduced for the creation of these extensions. figure 6b depicts one possible order for these events. clearly, even if this particular scenario is not entirely correct, there must have been multiple sequential plasmid sequence addition events on several of the chromosomes. our previous maximum-likelihood tree analysis of chromosomal snps  identified four chromosomal subgroups that are clustered with very strong support - group a , group b , group c  and group d   <cit> . snp groups a, b, c and d correspond to the right end types m- <dig>  s, m3 + m- <dig> and l-1 + l-2 + m- <dig>  respectively . no right end organizational type is found in more than one snp group, and the branching order of the right end tree in fig. 6b is compatible with the chromosomal snp tree. strains  <dig>  sh-2- <dig> and ca <dig> were not included in the chromosome snp analysis, but their chromosomal right ends have been analyzed , and they fit appropriately in fig. 6b if their ospc type is considered to be indicative of their chromosomal snp type . the concordance of the chromosome snp groups and chromosome right end types suggests that the different right end extensions have not been horizontally transferred between chromosomal constant region lineages.fig.  <dig>

we also note that the sequence of plasmid lp28- <dig> subtype iii in isolate 64b contains closely related homologs of a putative arginine catabolism gene  and a transporter gene  , which are the two rightmost genes in the “constant region” of the chromosome in all b. burgdorferi strains that have been examined. in addition to this normally chromosomal sequence, the adjacent ~ <dig> kbp at the left end of this plasmid are  <dig> % identical to the contiguous plasmid-like sequences at the right end of the strain b <dig> chromosome . this is parsimoniously explained if the leftmost ~ <dig>  kbp of lp28- <dig> subtype iii is actually derived from the right end of an m- <dig> type chromosome. thus, genetic information has apparently been transferred from the right end of the chromosome onto a linear plasmid.

chromosomal lineage correlates with plasmid subtypes
are linear plasmid subtypes limited to particular chromosomal lineages, or are they horizontally exchanged relative to the chromosome at an appreciable rate? in spite of numerous examples of past horizontal exchange of various smaller regions , it is not known if whole plasmids exchange between b. burgdorferi lineages at a significant rate. previous analyses have shown a strong correspondence between the chromosomal snp pattern and the snp pattern of plasmid cp <dig>  as well as with the snp pattern of plasmid lp <dig>  <cit> . this indicates that reassortment of the chromosome and these two plasmids is not common  <cit> . but failure of cp <dig> or lp <dig> to exchange does not mean that other plasmids may not exchange more rapidly. by considering the distribution of the b. burgdorferi linear plasmid subtypes , we can begin to examine the natural population dynamics of the linear plasmids of b. burgdorferi.


b. burgdorferi chromosomal variation studies have noted a number of subgroups within this species , and in particular our recent analysis of the sequenced chromosomes showed that strains 297/156a, 72a/118a and zs7/bol <dig> represent three pairs of particularly closely related chromosomes  <cit> . the chromosome of  <dig> has not been completely sequenced, but it is rather closely related to 156a by its similarity to 156a rrna igs <dig> sequence, multilocus sequence typing analyses, right end structure , as well as snp analyses of the two “non-exchanging”  plasmids cp <dig> and lp <dig>  <cit> .

the currently available sample size is small, but even at this early stage it is clear that many linear plasmid subtypes are not randomly distributed among the chromosomal types. for example lp <dig> and lp <dig> plasmid subtypes with multiple members are distributed as follows: in lp <dig> both subtype iv plasmids are present in chromosomal snp group a strains, and the seven subtype iii plasmids are limited to two of the four groups, c and d. similarly, all four lp <dig> subtype i plasmids are found in group a, all three subtype ii plasmids are in group d, and the two subtype iii plasmids are found in group c. in addition, the cp32- <dig> deletions a and i  are limited to chromosomal groups d and c, respectively. figure  <dig> shows the number of cognate and noncognate linear plasmid subtypes present in all pairwise comparisons of the  <dig> b. burgdorferi genomes . these comparison values were classified into three relatedness classes; highly related, moderately related and less related . isolates  <dig> and 156a have the most similar linear plasmid contents, with  <dig> to  <dig> plasmid types with identical subtype in both strains and only one plasmid type with different subtypes in the two strains. . the isolates with the least related plasmid contents are jd <dig> and wi91- <dig>  where no identical plasmid subtypes among the nine different types that are present in both strains. strikingly, the three pairs of strains whose plasmid subtypes are most similar, 297/156a, 72a/118a and zs7/bol <dig> , are the same three pairs identified as closest chromosomal relatives . these three pairs have 6– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> identical plasmid subtypes, respectively, and all three have only one case of different subtypes of the same plasmid type . of the eight moderately related strain pairs , six are pairs from within the same chromosomal group . the only two moderately related inter-group pairs are 156a/118a and 156a/72a are both comparisons between group d and c strains, and we note that the a/b chromosomes and c/d chromosomes form two more closely related groups  <cit> . of the  <dig> inter-group chromosomal comparisons in fig.  <dig>   <dig> are in the least related class . no close linear plasmid subtype relationships among the three strains in chromosomal group b were found, suggesting that the plasmids in the three strains in this group are more diverse than the strains within the other three chromosomal lineages. we also note that all pairwise comparisons show at least one pair of plasmids of different subtype from within the same pfam <dig> type.fig.  <dig> comparison of linear plasmid content of b. burgdorferi isolates. values outside parentheses are the number of plasmid subtypes in common in the pairwise comparisons . values in parentheses are the number of plasmids of the same pfam <dig> compatibility type that are different subtypes in the pairwise comparison . thick lines separate isolates with different chromosomal snp types . cell color indicates relatedness of linear plasmid contents as follows: pink, number of plasmids of same subtype/number of plasmids of different subtype is ≥4; yellow, same as pink only values ≥ <dig> and <4; blue, same a pink only values <1




in spite of the above correlation between chromosome type and plasmid content, results from this small sample do not rule out the possibility that horizontal transfer of whole linear plasmids has occurred among the lineages represented by the  <dig> genomes; for example, lp28- <dig> subtype ii is present along with at least one other lp28- <dig> subtype in each of the four chromosomal snp groups; however, each of the other six subtypes is present in only one chromosomal snp group and so could have arisen within that group’s lineage. indeed, the distribution of each plasmid and its subtypes among the  <dig> isolates can be explained by a scheme that includes only linear descent and creation of new subtypes within the different chromosomal groups, where all subtypes  are created only once. the current analysis does not identify any unambiguous example of whole linear plasmid transfer, and we conclude that, although it might occur occasionally, the rate of such transfer is not high enough to mask the observed parallels between chromosomal type and plasmid subtype content. this interpretation, while admittedly still somewhat speculative, in turn suggests that generation of novel plasmid subtypes has occurred multiple times within each of the four chromosomal snp lineages since the evolutionary separation of these lineages.

any correlation between geographic location or animal host and plasmid content remains to be clarified. our study includes individual wisconsin, california, germany and italy isolates, in addition to ten southern new england/new york isolates. a number of the identified plasmid subtypes are unique to isolates of a particular geographic region; for example, nine of the wisconsin isolate wi91-23’s  <dig> linear plasmid subtypes are unique to this isolate, three of the california isolate ca- <dig> a’s six linear plasmid subtypes are unique, and lp <dig> subtype iv, lp28- <dig> subtype v, lp28- <dig> subtype v and lp28- <dig> are present only in the european isolates. however, there are also numerous unique plasmid subtypes in individual new england isolates , and on the other hand, there are also identical lp <dig> subtypes in geographically distant locations . clearly, analysis of plasmid subtypes in many more isolates from different geographical regions and from various hosts will be required to understand the population biology of b. burgdorferi in terms of the relationship of plasmid content to geographic location, animal host, etc.


plasmids in b. burgdorferi isolates with closely related ospc genes
the four chromosomal snp types discussed above represent very broad lineages. do narrower lineages exhibit perhaps even stronger linear plasmid uniformity? each chromosomal snp type includes isolates that have different rrna igs <dig> spacer sequences  and different ospc types , both of which have been used to classify b. burgdorferi into narrower groups  <cit> . most of the b. burgdorferi genome sequences are from strains that are different igs <dig> and ospc types, so it is therefore perhaps not surprising that all of these  <dig> isolates have different plasmid contents. but might isolates with identical rrna igs <dig> sequences or identical ospc types have more similar plasmid contents? information is rather meager at present, but we have identified  <dig> strains where igs <dig> sequences and ospc types are known and for which there is some information available on linear plasmid content. in addition to the  <dig> complete genomes, igs <dig> and ospc sequences have been determined for strains emc-ny- <dig>  sh-2- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 30757; see methods). right end chromosome extension lengths were also determined for these isolates by southern analysis as described in casjens et al.  <cit>  . table  <dig> shows that these  <dig> isolates fall into eight chromosomal rrna igs <dig> types and eight parallel ospc types; this correlation between igs <dig> type and ospc type has been noted previously  <cit> . table  <dig> shows that each igs1/ospc group has an apparently invariant chromosomal right end extension, suggesting that horizontal transfer or invention of new right end extensions within these groups is not a common event . linear plasmid sizes for lp <dig>  lp <dig> and lp <dig> related plasmids are also shown in table 2). these plasmids were chosen here because they are the most variable in length; plasmid size differences of several kbp are ignored so any correlations would not be confused by measurement inaccuracies. there is no evidence in table  <dig> of size differences in these linear plasmids within any of the eight groups. thus, although this information is certainly incomplete at this time, these findings are consistent with the idea that these three linear plasmids are uniform within a single igs1/ospc type. in addition, stevenson and miller  <cit>  found that strains b <dig> and bl <dig>  have very similar cp <dig> contents by analysis of the sequence of the variable regions of their cp <dig> plasmids, as do strains  <dig> and sh-2- <dig> . additional study is clearly necessary, but this preliminary information suggests that isolates with very similar igs1/ospc genotypes may well usually have very similar plasmid contents.table  <dig> comparison of b. burgdorferi isolates with identical igs <dig> sequences

CONCLUSIONS
we have analyzed the sequences of the  <dig> plasmids present in the genomes of  <dig> b. burgdorferi isolates. since  <dig> plasmid types were found in the first genome sequenced  <cit> , seven more in the next three genomes  <cit> , and only four more in the final ten genomes analyzed, it appears that the probability of finding new types is diminishing rather rapidly with the analysis of additional isolates. here we identified four new plasmid putative compatibility types  in the ten newly analyzed genome sequences, which brings the total to  <dig> known types. however, since relatively few strains from outside new england have been analyzed in this detail, the possibility remains that more novel plasmid types will be found in other geographical regions.

we showed here that most of the linear plasmids are present in the b. burgdorferi population as multiple organizational subtypes, and the number of these subtypes is projected to be fairly large but limited. the mosaic sequence boundaries in these plasmids represent rare and essentially non-revertable genetic markers that can be used to evolutionarily and epidemiologically track plasmids. previous studies using small numbers of genetic markers have noticed anecdotal correlations between plasmid content and chromosomal genotype  <cit> , and the more comprehensive findings presented here support this notion. among the  <dig> sequenced genomes and  <dig> additional isolates that we examined by other means, isolates with more closely related chromosomes and cp <dig> plasmids have more closely related linear plasmid contents. these findings indicate that, although horizontal transfer of linear plasmid genetic material between b. burgdorferi lineages clearly does occur in nature , there is as yet no evidence of whole linear plasmid transfer in the wild. we note that a number of the plasmids appear to be prophages or related to prophages  <cit>  and so might be expected to transfer as whole entities. in particular, the cp <dig> circular plasmids have been shown to be transferred, apparently as phage virions, between strains in the laboratory  <cit> . however, the cp <dig> plasmids have apparently undergone many apparently homologous exchanges that would tend to obscure past whole plasmid transfer . in any case, plasmid transfer is not frequent enough to disrupt the correlation that exists at this stage of analysis between chromosomal igs and cp <dig> ospc markers and linear plasmid organizational subtypes. a complete picture of b. burgdorferi population structure will certainly require an understanding of the complete gamut of plasmid organizational subtypes and their distribution in all chromosomal lineages.
