BACKGROUND
proper functioning of the er is critical for cell survival and function. perturbations in protein folding in the er or in trafficking of secretory proteins are associated with a large number of human maladies, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, and can lead to chronic inflammation and cancer . the er is the first cellular compartment in which secretory and membrane proteins undergo post-translational modification as they progress through the cellular membrane systems to their final functional location. when er homeostasis is disrupted or trafficking is blocked, cells attempt to correct the problem via induction of stress response pathways such as the unfolded protein response  and the er overload response , phylogenetically conserved mechanisms for dealing with cellular assaults .

the upr and eor signaling programs can be activated by the presence of unusually large amounts of proteins within the er that are not trafficked to the golgi. for instance, the upr is induced when mutant proteins cannot be properly folded and accumulate within the er lumen. the eor, which is characterized by activation of the rel transcription factor nf-κb and its downstream signaling pathways, is stimulated by events such as viral infection that produce overwhelming amounts of non-mutant proteins .

the upr attenuates translation to decrease overall protein load in the er and activates transcription of genes encoding chaperones, oxidoreductases, and other proteins necessary for folding and post-translational modification. genes involved in protein metabolism are up regulated as well. the activated upr also targets improperly folded proteins to the er-associated degradation  pathway and up regulates genes necessary for protein metabolism. cells unable to overcome er stress may ultimately die by apoptosis .

three cellular signal transduction pathways mediate downstream upr or eor events . in mammals perk, atf <dig> and ire- <dig> are er transmembrane proteins, with n-termini in the er lumen and c-termini in the cytoplasm, which serve as sensors for changes within the er, including alterations in calcium levels, redox environment or levels of nascent proteins. translational attenuation, which decreases the overall amount of nascent protein requiring er modification and folding, is mediated by perk kinase activation by autophosphorylation. subsequent perk inactivation of the eif2α translation initiation factor via phosphorylation is responsible for the resulting translational attenuation.

upon upr induction, the ire- <dig> endonuclease is also phosphorylated, allowing cleavage of the xbp <dig> mrna to produce a functional bzip transcription factor that positively regulates expression of downstream genes such as er chaperones. ire- <dig> also targets a subset of mrnas encoding membrane and secreted proteins for degradation  <cit> . the third upr signal, atf <dig> is a transcription factor that is released from the er during cellular stress, moves to the golgi for final modification, and then activates transcription of downstream genes including chaperones and xbp <dig>  there are drosophila counterparts to perk , atf <dig>  ire- <dig> and xbp <dig> , although the genes and their targets are largely unstudied in this model system.

one or more of the signaling cascades involved in the upr also activate the eor and nf-κb. this nf-κb activation occurs post-translationally, possibly as a result of perk-mediated translational attenuation of the nf-κb inhibitory partner i-κb  <cit> . other data suggest a model in which nf-κb is a downstream target of ire- <dig> through an interaction between ire- <dig> and the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase traf <dig> that leads to nf-κb activation  <cit> . yeast do not have nf-κb homologs and lack two of the upr signaling pathways found in multi-cellular organisms; all known upr signaling in yeast is regulated by ire- <dig> 

it is not clear that activation of the upr and eor are entirely separable events since both responses require components of the same er stress-activated signaling cascades  <cit> . several chemical agents that induce the upr also trigger the eor, although some inducers may be pathway specific . one possibility is that the eor is a later response to stresses that cannot be overcome by the initial upr activation  <cit> . early upr activation may induce "adaptation genes", and, if the stress cannot be overcome, the "alarm genes" characteristic of the eor may be induced in a final effort to save cells before they initiate apoptosis  <cit> .

members of the p <dig> protein family are constituents of er and golgi-derived vesicles and are hypothesized to function in a variety of ways in intracellular protein trafficking . since loss of p <dig> function reduces trafficking of specific proteins  <cit>  and induces the upr in yeast  <cit> , we reasoned that loss of p <dig> expression in drosophila should similarly reduce protein trafficking and induce an er stress response. because we expected trafficking of otherwise normal proteins to be affected in p <dig> mutants, we further predicted that the drosophila stress response would differ from that in yeast by more closely resembling the eor rather than the upr and that the response would be activated by the pek or ire- <dig> pathways. our genome-wide expression profiling and genetic interaction studies are consistent with the hypotheses that loss of p <dig> function leads to activation of stress responses in metazoans and that both the pek and ire- <dig> pathways may be involved in these responses through activation of the nf-κb proteins dif and rel.

RESULTS
since deletion of a yeast p <dig> protein induces an er stress response  <cit> , we predicted that loss of a drosophila p <dig> protein, loj, would elicit a similar response in flies. because flies contain all three stress response pathways  while yeast only have the ire-1-mediated response, we expected that loss of trafficking due to a p <dig> mutation might induce multiple er stress-activated signaling pathways. since one characteristic of er stress responses is transcriptional activation of numerous gene products to ameliorate the stress, we utilized a genomic profiling approach to determine the genes with altered expression in loj00898/loj <dig> mutants  compared to controls. we showed previously that this allelic combination is strongly hypomorphic and probably genetically null  <cit> .

loj transcripts and proteins are highly expressed in the follicle cells of developing eggs and in the central nervous system   <cit>  as well as in other tissues such as the gut and fat body . for our analyses, female abdomens containing the ovaries, genital tract, fat, and gut tissue were dissected away from the remainder of the body , which contains the entire cns as well as the fat surrounding the head. mutant and control samples from either the abdomen or head/thorax were used to generate labeled samples for microarray analyses using affymetrix drosophila genome  <dig>  arrays. we identified a similar number of expression changes in each of the two samples using a  <dig> -fold cut-off . in the abdominal preparations  <dig> genes showed transcriptional changes, and  <dig> genes were identified in the head/thorax samples. ninety-seven of the genes are common to both tissue preparations .

of the  <dig> genes showing transcriptional changes in one or both tissues, approximately one fifth  are up regulated by various pathogens or septic injury ; many are targets of the toll or imd signaling cascades  <cit> . the toll pathway in drosophila regulates immune response to pathogens and septic injury by activating the nf-κb transcription factors dorsal  and dif  <cit> , while the imd pathway branches downstream of tak <dig> to activate jun kinase  and relish  signaling in response to pathogens or injury  <cit> . rel is the third nf-κb transcription factor in drosophila that controls humoral immune responses  <cit> . since activation of nf-κb is the hallmark of the eor, our data showing increased levels of numerous immune responsive and nf-κb target genes suggest that a stress response that includes the eor is activated in loj mutant females.

expression changes common to both tissues
while the majority of the genes identified in our analyses were specific to either the abdomen or the head/thorax samples, numerous changes were common to both tissue preparations. twenty genes had decreased levels  in both mutant tissue samples, while  <dig> genes showed increased expression in loj mutants compared to controls . seventeen of these  <dig> genes were found previously to be transcriptionally responsive to the er stress inducing agent tunicamycin  <cit> . fourteen of our genes show a similar response to tunicamycin-induced changes, while  <dig> genes show the opposite pattern . tequila, which is down regulated in loj mutants , is also repressed in tissue culture cells in which the upr has been induced by dithiothreitol treatment; this decrease is dependent upon ire- <dig> but not xbp <dig>  <cit> .

of the genes identified in both tissue data sets,  <dig> are known or likely drosophila immune-regulated genes , the majority of which are targets of toll or imd signaling . gadd45β is an er stress response gene that is regulated by nf-κb and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect by down regulating jnk signaling  <cit> . also up regulated in this common data set are genes encoding small immune peptides such as cecropins and attacins as well as the gram-positive bacteria peptidoglycan receptor pgrp-sa . the nf-κb gene rel also has increased transcript levels in the loj mutant tissues.

to validate our microarray data, we used qpcr to test a subset of genes with altered expression profiles in both tissue samples. each tissue was assayed independently and showed the expected directional change . for most of the genes tested, the gene expression levels are significantly different between loj mutants and controls in both tissues . in only one instance  was the difference non significant for either tissue.

mutations in the p <dig> gene eclair also have elevated levels of immune-regulated products
we anticipated that increased expression of immune responsive and nf-κb target genes would be a general response to p <dig> gene mutations in multi-cellular animals. in drosophila, mutations in two other p <dig> genes, eclair  and baiser , cause oviposition defects similar to those observed for loj mutants  <cit> . both eca and bai are co-expressed with loj in ovarian follicle cells and are expressed in the cns  <cit> .

we generated viable eca mutant females and tested them for increased expression of four of the immune regulated genes that are up regulated in loj mutants . expression of cg <dig>  tsp42ed and frost is significantly increased in eca mutants relative to controls, while socs36e is not significantly increased in eca mutants . these results indicate that activation of nf-κb and immune-regulated genes may be a general response to p <dig> loss-of-function mutations.

expression changes in the abdomen
the egg tissue of the drosophila abdomen expresses loj throughout all stages of development, with particularly strong expression observed at stage  <dig> in the somatically-derived follicle cell layer  <cit> , whose primary function is secreting factors needed for eggshell formation. low-level loj expression is also observed in the nurse cells  <cit>  that produce mrnas and other factors necessary for embryonic development. our recent analysis indicates that the loj protein is highly expressed in other adult abdominal tissues as well, including the fat body and the gut .

we identified a set of  <dig> genes with altered expression patterns in loj mutant abdominal tissue. of these loci,  <dig> were noted only in the abdomen while the remaining  <dig> were also detected in the head/thorax samples . forty-seven of the  <dig> abdomen-specific genes were previously determined to be immune responsive. most are transcriptional targets of toll or imd signaling while others are components of jnk signaling pathways . general immune-responsive genes are overrepresented in this data set  as are components of jnk signaling .

the abdominal tissue also differentially expressed  <dig> genes with no known function in immunity . most of the published genome profiling experiments that identified immune response genes used an earlier version of the drosophila genome array  <cit>  that lacked many of the transcriptional units on the drosophila genome  <dig>  chips used in this study. therefore, some of the genes in additional file  <dig> likely have previously unrecognized roles in the immune response.

genes in the up-regulated class have functions consistent with involvement in a upr response . cg <dig> encodes a small hsp20-like chaperone. cg <dig> encodes an asparagine synthetase, a protein previously implicated in the mammalian er stress response  <cit> . the predicted function of cg <dig> is unfolded protein binding, suggesting it functions in the upr as well. many other up-regulated genes encode proteins with predicted functions such as proteolysis and peptidolysis, metabolism and oxidoreductase activity.

expression changes in the head/thorax
a subset of cells in the cns also has high-level loj expression, and cns expression of loj in loj mutants rescues egg laying and fertility  <cit> . we separated the loj cns effects from those occurring in developing eggs and gut by dissecting the abdomen  away from the remainder of the fly.

we identified a set of  <dig> genes differentially regulated in these samples compared to those from abdomens . many up-regulated genes function in processes such as lipid and protein metabolism. again, approximately 20% of the genes have been implicated in immune signaling . immune responsive as well as jnk pathway components are also overrepresented in the head/thorax preparations .

loj interacts genetically with members of the nf-κb genetic signaling pathways
the toll and imd pathways activate different, but sometimes overlapping, immune-responsive genes depending upon the pathogen  <cit> . in adult flies, the nf-κb protein dif is the toll signaling effecter molecule in response to immune challenge, while the adult function of dl is not clear. rel functions downstream of imd signaling to activate dirgs . the fact that we observed increased message levels of signaling molecules that lie downstream of each pathway begs the question as to whether the three drosophila nf-κb proteins are activated in the loj mutant. therefore, we tested for genetic interactions between loj and the three drosophila nf-κb genes to identify which may be involved in the stress response.

since loj is expressed throughout development  <cit> , we anticipated that activation of the er stress response in loj mutants would be important for survival to adult eclosion from the pupal case. if nf-κb proteins are needed for stress response activation to survive pupation, we expected that reducing nf-κb levels in the loj mutant would affect adult survival. when we assayed eclosion rates in double mutant combinations of loj with dif, dl or rel, we found that fewer than the expected number of dif; loj or loj, rel mutant offspring emerged from the pupal case . these results suggest that the dif and rel proteins are needed in loj mutants to ameliorate the stress response so that animals can survive development.

for tests with dif, dl, and imd each of the four expected progeny classes should be represented at equal frequency . only two types of progeny are produced in the loj <dig>  rele20/tm <dig>  sb cross, so each class should account for 50% of the offspring. homozygous loj <dig>  loj <dig>  dif <dig> or dl <dig> mutations independently affect adult viability, while rele <dig> and imdey <dig> stocks are maintained as homozygotes. adult eclosion is dramatically reduced when dif <dig> or rele <dig>  homozygous mutations are introduced into the loj <dig> homozygous mutant background. similar results were obtained for  <dig> independent loj <dig>  rele <dig> recombinant strains and different genetic backgrounds containing imdey <dig>  large numbers of loj <dig>  rele20/rele <dig> and loj <dig>  rele20/loj <dig>  survive to adulthood , indicating that the decreased eclosion of loj <dig>  rele <dig> animals is largely due to effects from mutations in both genes. although homozygous mutations in loj or dl decrease adult viability, we did not observe additional, large effects when both genes are mutated in  <dig> different genetic backgrounds.

discussion
when the er has an unusually high burden of protein products due to viral infection, mutation, or other assaults, mechanisms are activated to reduce the er protein load. our results that stress response genes are activated in p <dig> mutants suggest that loss of p <dig> protein function causes stress, possibly by disrupting er homeostasis. furthermore, we show that a large proportion of the genes with altered transcriptional profiles in a loj p <dig> mutant genetic background are known or suspected targets of immune signaling pathways regulated by the drosophila nf-κb proteins dif and relish; function of each of these proteins is needed for loj mutants to survive to adulthood. activation of nf-κb is the signature event in the eor response to increased er protein load.

the loj p <dig> mutant activates stress response genes
we discovered transcript-level changes in genes encoding factors involved in protein metabolism and folding that are consistent with induction of the upr. however, we did not identify all of the genes found in a previous study on tunicamycin-induced er stress in drosophila  <cit> , which identified approximately  <dig> transcriptional changes in untreated compared to tunicamycin-treated flies using a  <dig> -fold change threshold. tunicamycin activates the upr as well as the eor  <cit> .

in yeast, loss of p <dig> function results in increased splicing of the ire- <dig> target xbp <dig>  <cit> . we did not find evidence for increased transcription of xbp <dig> in our p <dig> mutant microarray experiment, which is consistent with the girardot et al. report  showing that the upr transcriptional target xbp <dig> is not up regulated in tunicamycin-treated flies. furthermore, a second rt-pcr-based assay did not reveal increased splicing of xbp <dig> in loj compared to control animals  nor did we observe activation of xbp1-egfp  <cit>  expression in loj mutants. the fact that increased xbp <dig> transcription and splicing are not detected could be because these responses occur prior to the time point of our assays. alternatively, some aspects of the tunicamycin and p <dig> mutant stress responses may be independent of xbp <dig> signaling. activated atf <dig> increases expression of xbp <dig> during er stress  <cit> , but atf <dig> signaling has not been implicated in nf-κb activation during the eor.

our study identified  <dig> expression changes,  <dig> of which were demonstrated previously to be tunicamycin sensitive. sixty-five transcripts had the same directionality as in girardot et al.   <cit> , while the remaining  <dig> show opposite patterns . the tunicamycin experiment differed from ours in that the researchers used wild-type drosophila adult male bodies and probed an earlier version of the drosophila genome array with lower transcriptional coverage. some of the differences in the two studies may be due to sex, genetic background and assayed transcripts. additionally, the loj mutants should be chronically stressed due to loss of p <dig> function throughout development; the tunicamycin-treated animals experienced an acute stress response since they were assayed  <dig> hrs after being placed on sugar medium containing tunicamycin  <cit> . therefore, we expect that many differences in the two studies are due to differential effects from chronic compared to acute stress responses.

our most interesting finding is the large number of immune-responsive genes with altered transcriptional profiles in the loj p <dig> mutant. since the majority of currently published studies on drosophila immune-responsive genes used the affymetrix version  <dig> drosophila genome arrays , they could not identify all immune-regulated loci. based upon their predicted functions, immune-regulated candidates from our study include cht <dig> , impl <dig> and cg <dig> .

loj interacts genetically with dif and rel
recognizing that increased dirg message levels could be explained by activation of one or more drosophila nf-κb proteins, we tested for genetic interactions between loj and dif, dl or rel. we found that dif2; loj and loj <dig>  rele <dig> mutant combinations dramatically reduced adult eclosion, while effects of the dl1; loj <dig> double mutant combination did not differ from dl1; loj00898/+ or dl1/+; loj <dig>  these results indicate that nf-κb and loj mutations interact with one another. the results suggest that the loj mutant stress response is needed for loj mutant animals to survive development and that this response is partially mediated by dif and rel. it is possible that the two mutations independently make a "sick" fly worse off. however, dif and rel are not required for viability, and neither dl nor imd mutations enhance the loj mutant phenotype, although both genes affect viability in loj/+ animals.

in our study we did not identify expression changes in all of the known immune-regulated genes. if both dif and rel are activated in the loj mutant, one might expect that all potential nf-κb target genes should be affected. however, nf-κb target sites in immune-responsive promoters are variably responsive to nf-κb and can be modulated by other factors to provide specialized immune responses  <cit> , possibly in a tissue-specific manner. therefore, the loj mutant may not activate all possible nf-κb targets because other cellular factors are needed for a strong response.

mechanisms for stress-induced activation of nf-κb
in mammals two potential mechanisms for er stress-induced nf-κb activation have been described. the first involves perk-mediated translational inhibition of the nf-κb inhibitor protein iκb  <cit> . in drosophila loss of iκb could only affect dif signaling since dif, but not rel, is maintained in an inactive form through an association with the drosophila iκb protein cactus  <cit> . degradation of cactus and release of its inhibitory effect on dif allows downstream transcriptional changes. in contrast, the drosophila nf-κb transcription factor rel is a bi-partite protein containing inhibitory as well as activating domains. similarly to the mammalian p <dig> and p <dig> nf-κb proteins, rel activation involves a proteosome-mediated cleavage event that releases the inhibitory domain from the activating domain. therefore, it is unlikely that pek-mediated translational attenuation of an inhibitor molecule functions in rel activation.

the second proposed mechanism for mammalian nf-κb activation due to er stress is mediated by ire- <dig> via an interaction with the tnf-receptor-associated factor  <dig>   <cit> . traf <dig> is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that activates nf-κb and jnk signaling . drosophila encodes a traf2-like molecule, and there is evidence that drosophila traf proteins are involved in toll, imd and jnk signaling  <cit> . one possible scenario for nf-κb activation due to er stress in drosophila is that ire- <dig> modulates the rel-induced er stress pathways while pek translational attenuation regulates dif signaling.

in yeast, loss of p <dig> protein function causes an er stress response, one consequence of which is secretion of the heat shock protein and er stress sensor bip  <cit> . interestingly, there is evidence in mammals that bip and related heat shock proteins bind to and activate toll-like receptors . therefore, it may be possible to induce nf-κb independently of pek, atf <dig> or ire- <dig> if bip is secreted. in drosophila, the toll receptor regulates dif and dorsal signaling. even if bip activation of toll receptors plays a role in stress-induced nf-κb activation, it cannot account for the observation that rel, which is not regulated by toll signaling, is induced and interacts genetically with loj. since imd regulates rel but does not interact genetically with loj, rel signaling in this p <dig> mutant context could be mediated by the ire-1/traf <dig> pathway rather than via imd. similarly, the ire-1/traf <dig> pathway may modulate the jnk response genes that are up regulated in loj mutants . because rel activation requires rel cleavage rather than disruption of an inhibitory protein interaction, it is unlikely that rel activation is immediately downstream of pek.

our analysis did not identify the same set of stress-responsive genes previously shown to require ire- <dig> but not other components of the upr/eor response  <cit> . only one locus, tequila, is down regulated in both experiments. however this difference in affected genes may be due to the stressors or the time periods examined.

there are other possibilities for the observed increases in nf-κb target genes in the loj mutant. one is that the observed stress response results from tissue damage occurring in loj mutants. tissue damage could activate nf-κb and stress response genes in the fat body. another possibility is that increased levels are due to increased message stability rather than activation of nf-κb in the adult. we cannot rule out the possibility that changes in stability of nf-κb target gene transcripts, rather than nf-κb activation, account for the observed expression differences between loj and wild-type females.

do loj p <dig> mutants have a trafficking defect?
since loj mutants have increased expression of many genes implicated in er stress responses and loj mutations interact genetically with mutations in two nf-κb genes, it is likely that intracellular trafficking is reduced in loj mutants. genes that encode components of the eggshell  are down regulated in abdominal tissue . it is possible that trafficking of these proteins or is slowed in loj mutants and provides feedback inhibition of transcription. alternatively, these products may be decreased in the loj mutant because egg production is slowed and fewer eggs of the stages that express these genes are present in loj females.

another interesting finding is that transcript levels of the octopamine receptor oamb are also decreased in the loj mutant . octopamine signaling is required for egg laying in flies and other insects  <cit> , and reduced oamb protein expression impairs female ovulation  <cit> . loss of octopamine signaling via decreased trafficking of the receptor or molecules involved in octopamine or oamb production could account for the egg-laying defect in loj mutants.

in both loj mutant tissue samples the p24- <dig> gene  is up regulated . p24- <dig> is a member of the drosophila p24-alpha subfamily, while loj is a member of the p24-gamma subfamily  <cit> . it is possible that p24- <dig> can substitute for some loj functions during development or in the adult. we plan to test these hypotheses during future investigations into p <dig> protein function in flies.

CONCLUSIONS
the genetic profiling data support our assertion that loss of p <dig> function induces a stress response that includes increasing the levels of nf-κb target gene transcripts, a hallmark of the eor. furthermore, the decreased viability of double mutants for loj and dif or rel suggests that these nf-kb proteins and their downstream signaling pathways play important roles in ameliorating the stress response.
