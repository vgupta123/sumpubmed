BACKGROUND
peanut  is one of the world’s most important oil seed crops. however, more than 70% of the peanut growing area is in arid and semi-arid regions. abiotic stress caused by drought, as well as the co-occurring biotic stress due to aspergillus flavus invasion of pods reduces plant productivity and the quality of seeds used for human consumption.

using traditional breeding methods, several cultivars were developed for abiotic and biotic stress resistances, such as for nematode resistance  <cit>  and tomato spotted wilt virus  resistance  <cit> . however, due to the scarcity of drought and salt tolerance alleles in the peanut gene pool, the quantitative nature of abiotic stress tolerance, and the difficulty of selection, peanut stress resistance breeding can be a time consuming, labor-intensive, and difficult process  <cit> .

targeting induced local lesions in genomes  is a powerful reverse genetics approach for functional genomics studies. it has been widely used to study gene function in various organisms including brassica napus  <cit> , brassica rapa  <cit> , lotus japonicus  <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , oryza sativa  <cit> , and drosophila  <cit> . traditional tilling involves pcr amplification followed by digestion with cel <dig> nuclease, a mismatch-specific nuclease that can recognize and cut heteroduplex dna to identify single nucleotide substitutions or small insertions/deletions  <cit> . alternatively, direct sequencing, high-performance liquid chromatography , regular electrophoresis, high-resolution melting , and maldi-tof can also be used for tilling applications  <cit> . next-generation sequencing  has been reported as the latest mutation detection method to screen tilling populations  <cit> . previous reports using illumina sequencing for high throughput tilling not only confirmed known mutations, but also identified several mutants missed from previous heteroduplex detection assays  <cit> . in this study, we detected mutations in genes related to abiotic and biotic stress resistances in arachis hypogaea using a high-throughput sequencing approach combined with two-dimensional pooling, and updated the tilling bioinformatics pipeline by implementing either read percentage with non-reference nucleotide  or minimum variance multiplier to set mutation prediction parameters .

lipoxygenases  comprise a family of structurally related non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases widely distributed among plants, animals, fungi and bacteria; they catalyse the addition of molecular oxygen to polyunsaturated fatty acids with a cis, cis- <dig> -pentadiene structural unit. according to the dioxygenation position of the substrates, plant lox enzymes can be classified into groups oxygenating polyunsaturated fatty acids at either c- <dig>  or c- <dig>   <cit> . as a multi-gene family, lox isoforms have an overall sequence identity of 25-40%. lox proteins have conserved domains for catalytic iron binding. the catalytic iron is ligated in an octahedral arrangement by three conserved histidines, one his/asn/ser, and the c-terminal isoleucine. the lox family has diversified functions in plants during vegetative growth and development, and contributes to formation of flavor and aroma compounds. in seeds, loxs can function as storage proteins, while some can also play a role in plant-fungus interactions. in peanut, five lipoxygenase genes have been reported. the gene coding for ahlox <dig>   <cit>  is specifically expressed in immature cotyledons, and can be highly induced in mature seeds infected with aspergillus spp., or by methyl jasmonate and wounding. two other genes in peanut, ahlox2- <dig>  <cit> , are also seed specifically expressed, with the highest expression level in mature embryo and immature cotyledons. although the expression of ahlox2- <dig> was increased by wounding, in contrast to ahlox <dig>  both ahlox <dig> and ahlox <dig> were repressed upon aspergillus infection of mature seed. recently, lox <dig> and lox <dig> genes were described and suggested to also be involved in the response to a. parasiticus infection in peanut  <cit> .

phospholipase d  is a widely distributed ubiquitous eukaryotic enzyme participating in various cellular processes  <cit> . it hydrolyses membrane phospholipids to pa  and a free head group such as choline in plants. pa is thought to be an effector in plant physiological processes such as secretion  <cit> , dna synthesis, and can be converted to second messengers such as diacyglycerol  <cit> . the active site of pld consists of four conservative amino acid sequences. motifs ii and iv contain hxkx4dx6g   and are conserved in all organisms. a minority of pld family members contain a single hkd motif, while most enzymes of this class contain two hdk motifs for bacterial, plant, yeast, and mammalian sources. plant pld normally contains a ca2+ - dependent phospholipid - binding c <dig> domain and requires ca2+ for activity   <cit> , whereas the others may resemble mammalian pld <dig> and pld <dig>  containing adjacent px  and ph  domains in the n-terminal region of the protein .

recent studies have shown that pld plays an important role in drought and stress tolerance  <cit> . it also plays a role in membrane degradation, seed germination, and acts in signal transduction cascades  <cit> . in peanut, two types of full-length pld cdna, ahpld <dig> and ahpld <dig> have been identified  <cit> . up-regulation was observed in drought sensitive lines compared with drought tolerant lines of peanut. southern blot analysis also indicated that pld is a multigene family in cultivated peanut  <cit> .

in this research, we targeted the above listed peanut stress related genes for cloning or amplification, set up an updated tilling by sequencing pipeline, and used this pipeline to screen for mutations in an ems induced population.

RESULTS
cloning of ah lox genes expressed in peanut roots
after screening a total of  <dig>  ×  <dig> colonies from a root cdna library,  <dig> hybridization signals were detected, including  <dig> high-,  <dig> medium-, and  <dig> low- strength. a total of  <dig> signals including all high- and medium-, and  <dig> low-strength hybridization signals were selected for secondary screening. colonies under a single signal were pooled and re-grown on a separate plate. overall,  <dig> plates were grown for secondary screening and  <dig> were identified with hybridization signals, with  <dig> plates from the “high signal” group,  <dig> from the “medium signal” group, and  <dig> from the “low signal” group. a single colony was then picked under each hybridization signal from the secondary screening. altogether, a total of  <dig> colonies were picked. of those,  <dig> colonies contained recombinant plasmids with insert sizes > 2 kb;  <dig> colonies showed insert sizes of 1–2 kb. overall,  <dig> clones  were picked for sanger sequencing. ten clones, ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, showed similarity with lox genes from arachis or other species in plant est databases . based on these sequence similarities, the sequences were assigned to three genes.

the sequences from clones c <dig>  and e <dig>  , had a complete open reading frame  of  <dig>  bp, a 68 bp 5'-utr  and 166 bp of 3'-utr. the gene encodes a predicted  <dig> amino acids with the estimated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. clones c <dig> and e <dig> had  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity overall and their deduced amino acid sequences were 100% identical. a genbank search found this gene was most similar to glycine max lox <dig>  and phaseolus vulgaris  lipoxygenase  . glycine max lox <dig> was most highly expressed in mature nodules and in roots, where it specifically expressed in the developing phloem  <cit> . in nodules, the expression of lox <dig> was correlated with the development of cells in the vasculature and lenticels. histochemical analyses suggested that glycine max lox <dig> is involved in the growth and development of specific cells within these tissues. the phaseolus vulgaris  lipoxygenase was also highly expressed in young, developing nodules  <cit> . gene structure prediction by aligning the sequence to glycine max lox <dig>  showed nine exons and eight introns for ahlox <dig> 

for the second gene, ahlox <dig> , two identical sequences  were most similar  to glycine max probable linoleate 9s-lipoxygenase 5-like mrna , glycine max lox <dig> mrna , which is highly expressed in seeds  <cit> , and medicago truncatula lipoxygenase mrna  . ahlox <dig> showed lower nucleotide similarity with ahlox <dig> and ahlox <dig>  60% nucleotide sequence identity with ahlox <dig> , and 97% with ahlox <dig>  with only three nucleotide differences in the orf. the ahlox <dig> sequence has a complete open reading frame  of  <dig>  bp, with a 90 bp 5'-utr and 249 bp of 3'-utr. the gene encodes  <dig> predicted amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the probable linoleate 9s-lipoxygenase  <dig>  for glycine max was predicted to be highly expressed in seed coat based on the est profile from ncbi. the translated amino acid sequence showed  <dig> % identity  between ahlox <dig> and ahlox <dig>  since peanut lox <dig> fell into the type i 9-lox cluster, ahlox <dig> probably also belongs to the type i 9-loxs  <cit> . due to high predicted amino acid sequence identity, ahlox <dig> and ahlox <dig> may be different forms of the same gene, but given that ahlox <dig> and ahlox <dig> also had high identity between deduced amino acid sequences   <cit>  we chose to assign a different name. this observation along with sequence variation among amplicons targeting ahlox <dig> described below , indicates that a more systematic study of peanut lipoxygenase genes in the peanut genome must be done to thoroughly characterize this multi-gene family. by aligning ahlox <dig> sequences with the soybean lox <dig> gene , nine exons and eight introns were predicted. pcr spanning intron  <dig> indicated that the size of the first intron is greater than 3 kb, which is much larger than that in soybean lox <dig>  . the linoleate 9s-lipoxygenase 5-like sequence from soybean  has an intron  <dig> size of  <dig>  bp, which is comparable with that of ahlox <dig>  based on soybean lipoxygenase gene information  <cit> , the corresponding locations of ahlox <dig> conserved histidine residues and fatty acid, iron, and oxygen binding sites were located in exons  <dig> to  <dig> .table  <dig>

for the third gene, ahlox <dig>  four sequences  were most similar to glycine max lipoxygenase- <dig>  mrna . cloned insert sizes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. the longest sequence   had an open reading frame  of  <dig>  bp. the glycine max lox <dig> was reported to have a lower expression level than lox <dig> in leaf and nodules but a similar expression level in roots  <cit> . gene structure prediction by aligning these sequences to soybean lox <dig>  showed nine exons and eight introns.

our rt-pcr results  indicated that ahlox <dig> was expressed in roots and leaves, ahlox <dig> was expressed in seeds, roots and leaves, while ahlox <dig> also was expressed in seeds, roots, and leaves, but probably at lower levels than ahlox <dig>  since ahlox <dig> was expressed at high levels in roots and seeds, and putative soybean ortholog  was predicted to be highly expressed in the seed coat, seed tissues being the sites of aspergillus invasion, ahlox <dig> was targeted for mutation discovery. furthermore, differential expression of a highly similar lipoxygenase  in genotypes resistant or susceptible to aspergillus infection recently was documented  <cit> . additional file  <dig> shows the phylogenetic relationships among all described peanut lipoxygenase genes.

reference sequence amplification and characterization
for mutation detection, amplicon sequences from the genotype 'tifrunner'  were used as references for alignment of short reads. previously published peanut allergen genes ara h  <dig> , ara h  <dig> , ara h  <dig> , ara h  <dig> , and genes controlling oleic:linoleic acid ratio  - ahfad2a, and ahfad2b were also used in this study  <cit> . the “01” and “02” or “a” and “b” indicates that they are homeologous, with one copy in each subgenome.

for ahlox <dig> and ahpld, the unique sequences obtained from amplicon sequencing were extracted as references. because there was sequence variation for each gene from amplicon sequencing, more than one sequence per gene was used for reference .

two primer sets were designed to amplify the 5' and 3' ends of ahlox <dig>  aimed at identifying mutations with early transcription truncation or at functionally critical domains . the 5' amplicons  spanned exons  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  while the 3' amplicon  covered exons  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> , and the corresponding introns. sequencing of the 5' amplicon revealed at least four copies with only three nucleotide positions differing overall . six sequence groups were obtained from the 3' amplicon with lengths of  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp, and  <dig>  bp. the sequences can be divided into five categories based on nucleotide similarities. totally there were  <dig> variant sites within the 3' end amplified region . based on the high sequence similarity between ahlox <dig> and ahlox <dig> , the amplicon used for tilling might be a mixture of both genes.table  <dig>

the amplification of ahpld <dig> at exon  <dig> indicated at least four sequence groups. an overall sixteen single nucleotide differences were detected. groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had only one or two nucleotide differences between each other and group  <dig> was most different from other three . amplification of diploid progenitor species a. duranensis  and a. ipaensis  with the primer set designed for ahpld <dig> did not show genome specific amplification at these regions .

the amplicon sequences of ahpld <dig> indicated at least five copies for ahpld <dig> exon  <dig>  there were five nucleotide differences in  <dig>  bp. sub-genome specific amplification was not detected from diploid progenitor species using the same set of primers .

mutation detection, and validation for single copy genes
we obtained  <dig>  million reads from one lane of an illumina hiseq run. after pre-processing, a total of  <dig> million reads  remained. for the twenty libraries , each library contained 3% to 7% of the total reads; the average read length was  <dig>  bp. over 85% of reads had the full read length of 94 bp.

the single copy genes included in this study were ara h  <dig> , ara h  <dig> , ara h  <dig> , ara h  <dig> , ahfad2a, and ahfad2b. the average depth of coverage for each sample for each gene per library at quality score cut-off from  <dig> to  <dig> was  <dig>  ). the average depth of coverage per sample for each gene per library was  <dig>  at sequence quality score  <dig> and  <dig>  at quality score  <dig>  the average depth of coverage for each sample varied for different genes and libraries. the non-reference base percentage  was calculated for all six known mutants with sequence quality scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> to set up mutation detection parameters . under these parameters , a set of unique mutants was detected . we found that when the quality score was increased, the minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide had to be decreased to detect all six know mutations. however, with the combination of higher sequence quality score and lower minimum non-reference percentage, the number of predicted mutations increased. so, changing the minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide could be critical to control false positive predictions. when the sequence quality score increased to  <dig> and above, no known mutants could be detected, possibly due to a less than average number of mutations in the libraries caused by either uneven pooling and/or amplification efficiency. because our purpose was to search for unknown single nucleotide mutations over a set of known sequences  within a certain frequency range, the mutations that could be consistently detected across all sequence qualities  was less likely due to sequencing errors.table  <dig>

in theory, if the amplicons were mixed at equal quantity, in the row pool, the expected read percentage with non-reference nucleotide should be  <dig> %  for homozygous mutants and  <dig> %  for heterozygous mutants, while in the column pool, the non-reference reads should account for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for the homozygous and heterozygous mutants, respectively. the read percentage with non-reference nucleotide can be lower than the theoretical value because of sequencing errors, uneven amplicon pooling, etc. decreasing the quality score can result in false-positive mutants due to sequencing errors , while increasing the quality score will decrease the mutation detection sensitivity . thus the known mutants became very important for selecting the appropriate parameters that were sensitive enough to detect non-reference nucleotides and reliable enough to distinguish them from sequencing errors. when unique mutants were detected, all other nucleotides under the hypothetical mutation positions were also calculated; the hypothetical mutations should have significantly greater numbers of mutation-responsible nucleotides than other non-reference nucleotides. we found that the minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide needed to predict a mutation was 3– <dig> times the average non-reference nucleotide frequency.

with the above parameters,  <dig> mutants were found at all quality scores ,  <dig> detected only at sequence quality scores  <dig> to  <dig> , and  <dig> detected at sequence quality scores  <dig> to  <dig> , respectively. subsequent mutation validation was done by several methods. initially, caps  assay was carried out for all predicted mutations that were amenable. from the “common” mutation group, six were suitable for caps assay , and five were validated . from the "high" group,  <dig> were appropriate , although only two ara h  <dig>  mutations were confirmed. from the “low” group, seven putative mutants were screened , but none of them was validated. since the “common” group had the highest validation rate, sscp  was then carried out for the remaining nine samples in this group; only one was validated. because sscp might have a higher false-negative rate, these nine samples were then tested by amplicon sequencing and four mutations were detected, including the previous one identified by sscp. this might indicate that sscp was not sufficiently sensitive for mutation detection in our study. altogether, a total of  <dig> predicted mutations were confirmed by the combined caps/sscp/amplicon sequencing approach.

for the remaining twenty samples in the “high” group and seven samples in the “low” group, five of them were predicted to have missense mutations  by geneious software  and thus were selected for amplicon sequencing. two from the “high” group were validated. altogether,  <dig> mutations were identified in the single copy genes. comparing the validation results with the mutation detection parameters, optimum parameters of phred score =  <dig> or  <dig>  with the minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide of  <dig> % and maximum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide of 5% could predict the largest number of “true” mutations .

in this experiment, we included  <dig> individuals from our previous tilling study. in addition to the six previously identified mutants, eight more mutants were recognized. five additional mutants were identified from the four new tilling plates . this indicated that tilling by sequencing is a more sensitive method for mutation detection than the cel i/li-cor heteroduplex detection method. one of the possible reasons is that for li-cor gels, 200 bp are excluded from the amplicon to adjust for the 100 bp regions at the top and bottom of tilling gel images that are difficult to analyse, which will shorten the actual tilling target region. another reason could be that cel i preferentially recognizes certain mismatches, c/c ≥ c/a ~ c/t ≥ g/g, over others  which might decrease the sensitivity for detecting these mutations  <cit> .

three mutations were identified in ara h  <dig> . the c to t transition at bp positions  <dig> and  <dig> are silent . the third predicts a t  <dig> i change. the substitution was predicted to be tolerated according to sift analysis   <cit>  . eight mutations were identified in ara h  <dig> . three of the mutations, with a c to t transition at bp position  <dig>  an a to g transition at bp position  <dig> , and a g to a transition at bp position  <dig>  are silent. the other five are predicted to induce amino acid changes: q 24 h, p  <dig> i, p 215 h, i 232 v, and k  <dig> q. the proline to isoleucine change at position  <dig> lies within epitopes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the proline to histidine change at position  <dig> was predicted to affect protein function by sift analysis . line  <dig> had five nucleotide changes in ara h  <dig> , two of which were silent.

only known mutations were re-detected in ara h  <dig>  and ahfad2a. a new mutation was identified in ara h  <dig> . the c to t mutation was found upstream of the start codon, but doesn’t appear to be located within any important promoter regions. one predicted amino acid change  that might affect protein function according to sift analysis was found in ahfad2b .

there are two possible reasons the predicted mutations were not validated. firstly, because homeologous genes were used as tilling references, in theory, the mutations predicted at identical regions for homeologous genes should be reported for both genes, while most of the time mutations from only one gene were reported due to the default bwa settings, which caused bias in the subsequent validation. secondly, the false positives could arise from sequencing errors introduced by the combination of lower quality reads  and the ambiguous mutation detection threshold. the minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide is set universally for each gene and each library once the quality cut-off is set, while the sequence depth for each gene and library may vary so that for a certain genes or libraries the true mutation calling may be mixed with noise.

mutation prediction and validation in multi-copy genes
seventeen validated mutations  were used as internal positive controls to detect mutations for multi-copy genes, with two major improvements. firstly, the true mutation percentage and false mutation percentage for the reference genes at all quality scores were calculated and were used as reference to set the mutation detection parameter . the improvement was made because when analyzing the first six known mutants, several mutants were relatively easier to detect, whereas one or two others were more difficult to detect. the more cryptic mutants required more relaxed parameters. these relaxed parameters introduced more noise into the results, and likely increased false positives. when using a larger set of reference mutations, and with multiple highly similar sequences, the problem of finding a relaxed value for read percentage with non-reference nucleotide that allowed detection of the entire mutation set was amplified. we thus updated our mutation detection strategy by maximizing efficiency  at the cost of decreasing the total number of true mutants. secondly, a true/false mutant factor was added for mutation identification. while looking through the results for true mutants missed from the single copy gene prediction, we found that most missed mutants were typically counted ~10- <dig> times more in  <dig> row/column, when compared to variant counts in other rows and columns; however, the variant percentage was below the specified minimum non-reference percentage. thus using minimum variance multiplier will be a more sensitive method for mutation prediction with multi-copy sequences. in addition, in bowtie  <dig> alignments, options were set to report all alignments instead of in the previous experiment when the bwa default parameters were used . this approach was taken because mutations detected in a conserved region for multi-copy genes could not be assigned to a specific copy without further validation .table  <dig>

for ahlox <dig>  seven out of the top ten predicted mutations had minimum quality scores above  <dig>  and the minimum variance multipliers around  <dig>  we selected six sets  as candidate mutants. seven of the hypothetical mutants were predicted to be missense and were chosen for validation, including one ahlox7_3’ and six ahlox7_5’. the ahlox7_3’ and three ahlox7_5’ were validated by caps assay with expected digestion patterns. the ahlox7_3' accounts for a leucine to proline change at bp position  <dig>  this mutation is located in exon  <dig>  but not at the fatty acid binding site. the sift  prediction  <cit>  indicated this amino acid change will affect protein function . all three mutations at the 5' end of ahlox <dig>  a 17 g, i 175 m, and l <dig> v, were found in exon  <dig> and in line  <dig> . these amino acid changes were less likely to affect protein function according to sift .

for ahpld <dig> and ahpld <dig>  mutations were calculated with minimum quality scores from  <dig> to  <dig>  and minimum variance multipliers from  <dig> to  <dig>  results showed the increase of minimum variance multiplier decreased the number of predicted mutations, as expected, while the increase of minimum quality had little effect on the predicted mutation numbers, which ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> when the parameters were changed. we chose twelve sets of parameters to keep the number of predicted mutations within a reasonable range, namely a minimum variance multiplier of  <dig> and  <dig> at quality  <dig>  and minimum variance multipliers of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> at sequence quality of  <dig> and  <dig>  all three mutations  that were common to all parameter sets were selected for validation. both sequencing and caps assay confirmed that all three predicted mutants were real. predicted amino acid changes are serine to phenylalanine at position  <dig>  methionine to isoleucine at position  <dig> for ahpld <dig> and proline to leucine at amino acid  <dig> for ahpld <dig>  the substitution at position  <dig> from s to f and the substitution at position  <dig> from m to i for ahpld <dig> and the substitution at position  <dig> for ahpld <dig> were predicted to affect protein function according to sift. none of them were located in the pld active site hxkxxxxd  motif  <cit> , or at the ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding c <dig> domain  <cit> .

in total,  <dig>  kb of the peanut genome was screened for mutations in single copy genes and  <dig>  kb was screened for multi-copy genes. twenty induced point mutations were identified. single nucleotide substitution was identified in both coding and non-coding regions. among the identified mutations, six were silent and fourteen were missense mutations; no nonsense mutations were found. the silent/missense mutation ratio is biased because we focused on validating non-silent mutations after the initial caps assay for single copy genes. the mutation frequency was calculated as follows: the size in base pairs of the region screened was multiplied by the total number of lines screened per total number of identified mutations. thus, the overall mutation frequency was  <dig> snp/  <dig>  kb / ] × 96 × 8). a total of thirteen mutations were newly identified for single copy genes in this study. the snp frequency for single copy genes was  <dig> snp/344 kb  and the snp frequency for multi-copy genes was  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb . our tilling population was treated with  <dig> % ems for 12 hours, and compared with the previously reported mutation frequency of  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb for single copy genes for the same population, the current tilling by sequencing method had a higher chance for mutation detection  <cit> . eleven out of twenty nucleotide changes were g to a or c to t transitions, as expected for ems-induced mutations. the other nine were unusual mutations. when looking closely at the unusual mutation types, eight out of nine were from the 07jkems <dig> population and out of these seven were from line  <dig>  this line also had more than one base change detected in amplicons, for multiple genes. moreover, some of the mutations were typical ems-induced g/c to a/t transitions and others were not. all mutations in line  <dig> were heterozygous. therefore line  <dig> might be interpreted as a suspicious contaminant . if this sample is excluded, the mutation frequency would be  <dig> snp/  <dig>  kb /] ×  <dig> × 8) overall, and  <dig> snp/466 kb ] × 96 × 8) for single copy genes, still higher than the previous report, and  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb  × 96 × 8) for multi-copy genes. the mutation frequency decreased from multi-copy gene screening because multi-copy genes are highly similar in sequence and the short reads mapped couldn’t be separated to a specific copy. thus the multi-copy genes have a lower read percentage with non-reference nucleotide than single copy genes. for mutations in the conserved region to be effectively detected, perhaps a higher sequencing depth/minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide coverage needs to be achieved. besides, thresholds need to be set to distinguish gene specific nucleotide differences from real mutations. by comparing with the previous tilling by sequencing study  <cit> , our mutation detection method has several differences. firstly, we used a set of known mutations to adjust the parameters for mutation detection. when all known mutations can be detected, we set the threshold for minimum and maximum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide to detect new mutations for single copy genes. secondly, we developed a method for detecting mutations in multi-copy, highly similar genes. after validating the single copy genes, our mutation detection pipeline was improved by setting the mutations at the ratio of non-reference nucleotide number counts of rows to columns at each position , which ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> at the minimum non-reference nucleotide percentage of  <dig> % and phred quality scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  although this method won’t allow us to detect the exact gene in which the mutation resides for the highly conserved regions, the subsequent mutation validation showed it was effective in discerning real mutations from background in spite of gene copy number. thirdly, due to the fact that mutation validation is time consuming, especially for multi-copy genes, and that the uneven pooling and pcr efficiency will all cause some mutations to be easier to detect than others, our mutation detection strategy focused on efficiency instead of detecting all possible mutations. after validating all the mutations, a few of the mutations were found to have a higher minimum non-reference coverage or a lower minimum non-reference coverage than the majority of the other known mutations. those mutations will obscure the threshold and allow more false positive mutations to be predicted, thus will complicate the subsequent validation process. the updated pipeline set a threshold where the majority of mutations could be detected, which improved the efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
by combining sequence quality score with minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide or non-reference variance multiplier, with the control being previously validated mutations, we refined our mutation discovery pipeline to identify mutations in both single copy and multiple copy genes. tilling by sequencing identified previously reported genes as well as new mutations from the same population. we also provide evidence that the ahlox <dig> and ahpld genes have multiple copies in the peanut genome. the mutations identified can be used to further study gene function.
