BACKGROUND
the development of methods to introduce exogenous dna into animals has allowed for diverse genetic manipulations in many organisms. in caenorhabditis elegans, transgenic strains are typically generated by injecting dna into the syncytial germ cells of the hermaphrodite gonad to form multi-copy extrachromosomal arrays  <cit> . these transgenes are semi-stable; transgenic animals are mosaic in that some cells lose the extrachromosomal array, and transmission of arrays to the next generation is partial  <cit> . extrachromosomal arrays contain hundreds of copies of the injected dna  <cit> , leading to silencing of the transgene expression in the germline  <cit> . although extrachromosomal arrays can be integrated into the chromosomes by gamma-ray irradiation or ultraviolet   <cit> , integrated arrays still contain a high copy-number of transgenes that seldom escape gene silencing.

methods using microparticle bombardment were developed to create low-copy chromosomal integrated lines  <cit> . the biolistic technique allows for direct integration of small amounts of exogenous dna into the chromosomes, avoiding the formation of extrachromosomal arrays. not every bombardment, however, produces integrant animals because of the low frequency of events, although large number of animals can be bombarded at once   <cit> . more recently, techniques using mos <dig> transposons were developed and are frequently used to generate single-copy gene insertions  <cit> . this technique, called mos1-mediated single-copy insertion , is based on homologous recombination: a double-stranded break in the chromosome mediated by mos <dig> excision is repaired with an exogenously supplied template carrying the gene of interest and homology arms, generating the designed single copy insertion  <cit> . mossci methods, in which a recipient strain carrying a mos <dig> element is microinjected with a targeting vector and a mos <dig> transposase expression vector, exhibit a high frequency of insertion, and injection of  <dig> worms is enough to obtain integrant animals  <cit> . in the mossci method, large sized targeting vectors that contain positive selection marker, 5'- and 3'- homology arms, and gene of interest must be constructed for each insertion, although a gateway-compatible tool kit for mossci has been developed  <cit> .

in reverse genetic studies, ultraviolet trimethylpsoralen , which induces a small deletion in the chromosomes, has been widely used to generate deletion mutants  <cit> . in addition to deletions, insertions of unexpected dna fragments are often observed, suggesting that non-homologous dna is used as a template in end-joining repair mechanisms. uv irradiation  and tmp treatment has a higher mutation frequency and less rearrangement of chromosomes, such as inversion and translocation, compared to uv irradiation , which is used for insertion of extrachromosomal arrays  <cit> .

in the present study, we developed a technique using uv/tmp that produces single- or low- copy gene integrations from extrachromosomal arrays. in this method, we used a positive selection marker flanked by loxp sites, allowing the marker to be excised by the cre recombinase.

RESULTS
transgene integration using uv/tmp methods
our methods were based on random integrations of transgenes into the chromosomes from multi-copy extrachromosomal arrays. we adopted a new positive-negative selection strategy as follows: positive selection was based on rescue of the vps- <dig> mutant phenotype. vps- <dig> mutants are unable to grow and reproduce normally at 20°c  <cit> . as a result, only vps- <dig> mutants carrying the positive selection marker, the vps- <dig> mini gene, grow and reproduce, allowing for easy identification of the transformants. to discriminate single- or low-copy integrations from extrachromosomal arrays and multi-copy integrations, we used ben- <dig> as a negative selection marker. mutants of ben- <dig>  which encodes a ß-tubulin of c. elegans, are resistant to an anti-tubulin drug benzimidazole: mutants grow paradoxically more quickly than wild-type animals, which are severely unhealthy, dumpy, and uncoordinated in movement on benzimidazole-containing selection media  <cit> . thus, ben- <dig> mutants not carrying the negative selection marker, the ben- <dig> gene, predominantly grow and reproduce on the selection media, enabling differentiation of low copy integrants from ex arrays and multi-copy integrants that are highly likely to have the ben- <dig> gene .

we prepared a positive selection marker and a negative selection marker, as shown in figure  <dig>  the positive selection marker included a floxed vps- <dig> mini gene and partial human ß-globin  tag sequence to detect the insertion. the negative selection marker contained the ben- <dig> genomic sequence. extrachromosomal  arrays were generated by microinjection of the positive and negative selection plasmids with an injection marker into tm234;tm <dig>  to insert the extrachromosomal transgenes into the chromosomes, animals carrying ex arrays were treated with uv/tmp to induce a small deletion in the chromosomes, leading to insertion during gap repair. uv/tmp-treated animals were cultured on benzimidazole-containing media at 20°c for positive-negative selection. to identify integrants that retained an intact insertion sequence, we conducted pcr#a and pcr#b, which amplify the 5' and 3' regions, respectively, of hbg-loxp-vps-45-loxp .

frequency of integrations
we used tm234;tm246;tmex <dig> as a parent ex strain and performed three independent uv/tmp integration methods. approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  p <dig> animals from the parent ex strain were treated with uv/tmp. we then collected  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  f <dig> animals, and cultured them under the selection conditions. as a result,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> stable transformants were obtained. isolated transformants were further tested by pcr#a and pcr#b, resulting in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> integrated strains . the mean integration frequency  was  <dig> . the uv/tmp method produced a much higher frequency than the bombardment protocol   <cit> .

germline expression of transgenes
to validate the uv/tmp methods, we used a heat shock-inducible venus plasmid  as a tester plasmid. we co-injected phsp- <dig> ::venus with selection markers and an injection marker, generating a parent ex strain tm234;tm246;tmex <dig>  approximately  <dig>  p <dig> animals were treated by uv/tmp and cultured for positive-negative selection as described above, resulting in  <dig> transformants. to identify integrated strains retaining the intact phsp- <dig> ::venus sequence, we performed pcr#c, which amplifies the whole region of phsp- <dig> ::venus . as a result, four integrant strains were isolated . the relative low frequency  compared to that of hbg#1- <dig>  was probably due to the length of the transgene to be inserted. next, we tested whether transgenes can be expressed in germ cells, because high-copy transgenes are usually silenced in the germline. four integrants were heat-shocked at 32°c for  <dig> h, followed by culture at 20°c for  <dig> h. as a result, venus protein expression in the germline was observed in all four integrant strains . we also analyzed the venus mrna level by quantitative rt-pcr, which showed an extensive induction . these findings suggested that these strains contain low-copy or single-copy of transgenes.

copy number of integrated transgenes
to determine the copy number of insertions, we performed quantitative pcr using purified genome dna as a template. we designed primer sets located within an exon of the vps- <dig> gene to detect both endogenous vps- <dig> and exogenous vps- <dig> mini gene insertions. eight hbg integrant strains were tested and compared to wild-type n <dig>  which has two copies of the vps- <dig> gene. as a result, five strains in the tm234;tm246-background: tmis <dig>  tmis <dig>  tmis <dig>  tmis <dig>  and tmis <dig> showed almost the same relative amount as n <dig>  suggesting that these strains had two copies of the vps- <dig> gene, probably because they were homozygous for alleles carrying a single insertion site . on the other hand, two strains in the tm234;tm246-background: tmis <dig>  tmis <dig> showed two times higher amounts, and one strain in the tm234;tm246-background: tmis <dig> showed three or four times higher amounts compared to n <dig> , suggesting that these strains contain a low-copy, but not a single-copy number, of transgenes. examination of tm234;tm246;tmex <dig>  the parent strain, revealed that the parent ex strain contained hundreds of copies of transgenes , consistent with previous studies  <cit> . these results strongly suggest that uv/tmp methods produce single- or low-copy integrations. we also determined the copy number of the vps- <dig> gene in four hsp integrated strains, revealing the single copy insertion of the vps- <dig> mini gene in tmis <dig> and tmis <dig> and low-copy, but not single-copy insertion, in tmis <dig> and tmis <dig> . we also examined the copy number of phsp- <dig> ::venus using primers that amplify the hsp- <dig>  promoter region, and found that tmis <dig>  tmis <dig>  tmis <dig> contained a single-copy insertion of phsp- <dig> ::venus . these results demonstrate that the uv/tmp method is useful for low-copy insertion of genes of interest and also highly likely to produce single-copy insertion.

genomic-excision using cre mrna microinjection
the eight hbg strains tested above were outcrossed with n <dig> to remove ben- <dig> and vps- <dig> mutations, and side mutations caused by uv/tmp treatment. these strains were further microinjected with cre recombinase mrna to excise the floxed vps- <dig> mini gene. f <dig> hermaphrodites from injected p <dig> animals were isolated and tested by pcr# <dig>  in which the 410-bp band was amplified only when an excision successfully occured . the results indicated that all eight strains produced f <dig> animals carrying a cre/loxp-excised region. although the frequency varied among strains, excision occurred at  <dig> %  on average . all trials using at least two independently purified cre mrna produced excision in all strains tested . homozygotes for excised alleles were selected from f <dig> self-progenies of each strain, and assayed by pcr# <dig> as described above and pcr# <dig>  which produced a 1060-bp band when an unexcised region was present. as a result, tmis839cre, tmis840cre, tmis841cre, tmis843cre, tmis844cre, and tmis864cre  produced 410-bp bands with pcr# <dig> and no band with pcr# <dig>  indicating complete excision of the loxp sites . we confirmed that cre-untreated strains corresponding to these cre-treated strains showed 1060-bp bands with pcr# <dig> . on the other hand, tmis842cre and tmis852cre showed both products of pcr# <dig> and # <dig>  indicating the an unexcised region remained, although at least one excision occurred. a band of  <dig> to  <dig> bp observed in tm234;tm246;tmex <dig> was thought to be a product of the rearranged ex arrays. of six strains with complete excision, five strains were predicted to have single-copy insertions based on the quantitative pcr results. one strain, tmis <dig>  was predicted to have a few copies of the insertion, suggesting that insertion sites were segregated during outcrossing resulting in isolation of a single-copy insertion strain, or that a few loxp sites were simultaneously excised or both.

mapping
to determine the insertion sites and confirm chromosomal-excision  of the loxp sites, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism  mapping, in which linkage between the hbg-loxp sequence  and snps. we examined tmis840cre, tmis841cre, tmis843cre, tmis844cre, and tmis864cre, which originally contained a single-copy insertion of the transgenes and showed complete excision of the floxed vps- <dig> mini gene. cre-excised sites were mapped to i:-12~- <dig>  ii:-18~ <dig>  iii:4~ <dig>  x:8~ <dig>  and x:8~ <dig> in tmis840cre, tmis841cre, tmis843cre, tmis844cre, and tmis864cre, respectively . tmis839cre, which originally had multi-copy insertion but showed a complete excision pattern, was also tested, and showed a linked chromosomal position at iv:1~ <dig> . these insertion sites suggest that the transgenes were randomly integrated in the chromosomes. we also mapped the insertion sites of original strains with a tm234;tm246-background, and confirmed compatible insertion sites . these results indicated that chromosomal insertion of the floxed vps- <dig> mini gene was excised by cre recombinase.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we developed an alternative method to promote low copy/single copy integration using uv/tmp. this method is based on the familiar extrachromosomal transgenics and does not require any special equipment, and should be very easy for most c. elegans researchers. our methods exhibited higher efficiency when compared to the microparticle bombardment system, and lower efficiency when compared to mossci . the low-copy of integrated transgenic lines rather than single-copy lines, however, may be precious in some cases, e.g. when proteins of interest may not be sufficiently expressed by single-copy transgenes. indeed, a few-copies of phsp- <dig> ::venus transgene exhibited brighter fluorescence and expressed several times higher venus mrna than the single-copy transgene . we adopted vps- <dig> as a positive selection marker and ben- <dig> as a negative selection marker, whereas previous microparticle bombardment and mossci systems used other selection markers . the vps- <dig> mutants showed a distinct ts phenotype and ben- <dig> mutants exhibited a strong benzimidazole-resistant phenotype, both of which were fully rescued by transgenes, enabling desired integrants to be easily identified. our selection strategy offers a new gene set for positive-negative selection in many other screens. we used a floxed positive selection marker to be excised afterwards. previous studies showed that cre-mediated loxp excision successfully occurs in the extrachromosomal arrays  <cit> . in these cases, however, excision was limited in a small portion of hundreds of floxed transgenes. our results demonstrate cre-mediated chromosomal and complete excision in c. elegans for the first time. the uv/tmp integration method provides a useful approach to generating single/low-copy gene integrations.
