BACKGROUND
arsenic is one of the most toxic substances from the natural environment and is classified as a human carcinogen   <cit> . it is widely distributed in natural sources , anthropogenic sources , and in drugs and poisons in both organic and inorganic forms  <cit> . arsenic reacts with environmental oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur, generating more toxic, soluble inorganic compounds , and posses a serious threat to organism health  <cit> . dermal exposure to toxic trivalent or pentavalent arsenic compounds can produce skin cancer, melanosis, and dorsum  <cit> . inhalation of arsenic-contaminated air can affect the respiratory system and can cause laryngitis, rhinitis, and pulmonary diseases  <cit> . arsenic-contaminated water can be absorbed by the digestive system and leads to gastritis, abdominal pain, and anorexia. moreover, selenium deficiency can cause muscular dystrophy in various species, arsenic can also damage the liver, kidneys, heart, and reproductive and nervous systems . arsenic can traverse the blood brain barrier and accumulate in different regions of the brain, making it a target organ of arsenic toxicity and suggesting a role for it in neurological diseases  <cit> . because of their toxic effects, pollution of the environment with arsenic and arsenic compound attracts public attention  <cit> .

previous studies showed that the development of toxicity or alteration in cytokines level induced by molybdenum, cadmium, selenium and lead, which was assessed by evaluating mrna expression and western blot . developing brain tissue is vulnerable to toxic arsenic  <cit> , and arsenic causes histopathological changes to developing brain tissue . several reports have indicated that acute or chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic causes neural injury  <cit> . however, little is known regarding whether arsenic-induced neural injury will result in an inflammatory response in the brain tissues of birds. one of the hallmarks of the inflammatory response is the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, which are needed to repair injured tissues  <cit> . nuclear transcription factor-κb  is attached to regulatory proteins named inhibitors of κb  and kept inactive in the cytosol  <cit> . iκbα and iκbβ are the main proteins involved in nf-κb activation and sustained activation, respectively. nf-κb is activated under inflammation stimulation and then moves to the nucleus, recognizes the promoter region and regulates the transcription of the pro-inflammatory genes inducible no synthase  and cyclooxygenase- <dig>  . inos is a member of the nos family and is widely distributed in a diverse number of nerve cells, whereas cox- <dig> is mainly found in specific neurons  <cit> . neither is generally expressed in resting nerve cells, and they are only expressed to take part in inflammatory responses under diverse pathological conditions, such as alzheimer’s disease, ischaemia, and neurodegenerative disorders . inos and cox- <dig> have vital roles in the pathophysiology of inflammation because they produce no and prostaglandins , respectively . low concentrations of no are sufficient to maintain physiological functions; however, elevated no exerts genotoxic harm on the host  <cit> . research on the inflammatory mediators nf-κb, inos, cox- <dig>  and prostaglandin e synthase  in chickens treated with arsenic trioxide  may contribute to the understanding of the possible inflammatory mechanisms of heavy metal arsenic in the nervous system of birds.

we explored the effects of arsenic on the mrna and protein levels of the main inflammatory-related mediators in the brain tissues of hy-line chickens to answer the question of whether arsenic induced an inflammatory response in chicken brain tissues, specifically the cerebrum, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem and myelencephalon, by affecting the expression of inflammatory cytokines.

discussion
as a natural component of the environment, animals easily access to relatively low levels of arsenic by eating food, breathing air, and drinking water  <cit> . the respiratory, cardiovascular gastrointestinal, haematological, renal, dermal, reproductive, and neurological toxicity of arsenic have been recorded for centuries  <cit> . therefore, it is valuable to research how environmental arsenic exposure affects organism health, particularly at low levels. one of the risk factors of neurological toxicity is arsenic. the acute or chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic causes arsenic-associated neurotoxicity in humans that cause behavioural alterations in turn  <cit> . in this study, we performed an ultrastructure assay of chicken brain tissues and found that arsenic trioxide exposure caused typical features of injury such as fusion of the nuclear membrane, nucleus shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and margination. the as2o3-induced neural injury could further trigger host defences, such as an inflammatory response. therefore, we investigated the effect of as2o <dig> on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the brain tissues of chickens.

when organisms are exposed to heavy metals, nf-κb level increases, interact with reactive oxygen species   <cit>  and accelerate the generation of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in our study, the expression of nf-κb was assessed by qrt-pcr, and we confirmed that nf-κb expression was significantly increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner except in the cerebrum and brainstem tissues from the as2o3-treated l group . the expression of nf-κb was similar trend in a time- and dose-dependent manner in five brain tissues. increased nf-κb activity has been found in the brain tissues of patients with alzheimer’s disease and takes part in the neurodegenerative process  <cit> . our results showed that arsenic activated nf-κb expression in the brain tissues of chickens, which might further induce the expression of other pro-inflammatory genes such as tnf-α, il- <dig>  inos, and cox- <dig> involved in the inflammatory process.

nos expression has a wide range of distribution and has been found in endothelial cells, glial cells, neurons, and perivascular nerves  <cit> . inos is a member of the nos family and is expressed in inflammatory cells and nerve cells including astrocytes and microglia . thus, inos is well known to be abundant in brain tissue  <cit> . in our study, we examined inos mrna and protein levels by qrt-pcr and western blot, respectively. the inos mrna levels were significantly increased in the brain tissues of the as2o3-treated groups except for the cerebellum tissues of the h group and the cerebrum tissues of the l group , suggesting that inos might play a role in inducing brain tissue inflammation upon arsenic exposure. in the cerebrum, there was a fluctuation in protein expression that may have been related to post transcriptional regulation of gene expression  <cit> . madrigal et al. reported that the inos level could be decreased in the brain cortex of animals treated with an nf-κb inhibitor  <cit> . this provides further evidence that in our study, the activation of nf-κb through arsenic exposure induced inos production in different brain tissues.

in addition, it is believed that cox- <dig> is of primary importance in the inflammatory response  <cit> . several studies have shown that kainic acid can lead to the induction of cox- <dig> expression and neuronal apoptosis. excitotoxin induces neuronal death in vitro and is accompanied by a selective elevation in the mrna level of cox- <dig>  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause the contents of cox to vary in vivo  <cit> . these observations demonstrate that the expression of cox- <dig> may be involved in the pathway leading to neuronal death. cox- <dig> expression and the subsequent prostaglandin e <dig>  production are both used as prognostic markers of inflammation  <cit> . additionally, these two markers are regarded as targets of therapeutic intervention during the inflammatory response. in the tissues damage, enzymes of inos and cyclooxygenase- <dig>  could induce the generation of prostaglandin e synthase   <cit> . and following the initiation of cox- <dig> expression, tnf-α could induce the activation of nf-κb in the cox- <dig> promoter  <cit> . consistent with these previous studies, the mrna levels of cox- <dig> and the ptges were up-regulated in time- and dose-dependent manners in the brain tissues from as2o3-treated chickens  compared with the control group, especially myelencephalon. the results illustrated that nf-κb activation also up-regulated the expression of inos, cox- <dig> and the ptges to take part in an arsenic-induced inflammatory response in the brain tissues of chickens.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we demonstrated that arsenic exposure in chickens affected the expression of inflammatory cytokines in their brain tissues. arsenic could trigger host defence and induce an inflammatory response in the brain tissues of chickens. the mrna levels of nf-κb, inos, cox- <dig> and ptges and the protein levels of inos were significantly up-regulated in the brain tissues from as2o3–treated chickens compared with the controls. the mechanisms of neurotoxicity induced by arsenic could lead to inflammatory response in chicken brain tissues.
