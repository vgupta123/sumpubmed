BACKGROUND
the human blood coagulation factor viii  is an essential protein involved in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. factor viii is synthesized as an ~ <dig> kda single chain protein containing  <dig> residues and composed of six domains: a1-a1-a2-a2-b-a3-a3-c1-c <dig>  <cit> . the a-domains are interconnected by short linker peptides that are rich in clusters of acidic residues. the linker peptides correspond to the residues: 337- <dig>  between a <dig> and a <dig> domains; 711- <dig>  at the c-terminus of a2-domain and 1649- <dig>  between b and a <dig> domains. activation of fviii by thrombin or factor xa  at three proteolytic sites arg372-ser <dig> , arg740-ser <dig> , and arg1689-ser <dig>  yields functionally active factor viii  that circulates in blood as a hetero-trimer among the heavy chain domains a <dig>  a <dig> and the contiguous light-chain domains a3-c1-c <dig>  factor viiia serves as a critical co-factor for proteinase enzyme factor ixa  in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation cascade during the proteolytic activation of zymogen factor x . the catalytic activity of fixa itself is very poor in the proteolysis of fx, but increases dramatically when bound to the co-factor fviiia  <cit> . the role of fviiia is to increase the catalytic rate constant  of fx activation by several orders  of magnitude and also to reduce the kd for its interaction with fixa and the km for substrate fx  <cit> . the clinical significance of fviiia is manifested by functional defects triggered by genetic mutations or acquired inhibitors that result in hemophilia-a, a severe bleeding hereditary coagulation disorder affecting  <dig> in  <dig> people  <cit> . the domain and sequence details of the models studied in the current work are shown in figure  <dig> 

the circulating fviiia in blood plasma has limited half-life due to rapid dissociation of a <dig> domain  <cit> . the loss of a <dig> domain has been attributed to the weak a2-subunit interactions with a <dig> and a <dig> domains  <cit> . consequently, a number of experimental site-specific mutagenesis studies have been directed towards understanding the specific residues involved in the inter-domain interactions as well as its interactions with the enzyme fixa and substrate fx  <cit> . despite a great progress in such efforts, the atomic level details of the full structures of zymogenic and activated forms of fviii still remain unclear. the detailed three-dimensional structures of fviii and fviiia are essential pre-requisites not only to understand the structural features but also the interactions with its physiological activators  and proteins associated with the intrinsinc tenase pathway . recently two low-resolution  x-ray crystal structures of fviii zymogen were reported  <cit> . both models were derived by fitting the electron density space of fviii crystals with the homology models of the individual domains derived from the human ceruloplasmin, bovine factor va  crystal structure and a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of c <dig> domain. the a-domains of fviii are homologous to the copper-binding ceruloplasmin protein with ~35% sequence identity while the c-domains belong to discoidin family of proteins with variable homology. both crystal structure models reported unusually high degree of thermal disorder with the average thermal b-factors of over  <dig> Å <dig>  while these models provided a great detail about the overall global features of the domain organization within the x-ray crystallographic space, the low resolution of the crystal structures limits their reliability for the atomic-level structural details of the domain-domain interactions. backbone superimposition of the two crystal structures  revealed significant conformational differences in the solvent-exposed loop regions. also, the reported crystallographic data lacks the structural information for the functionally important linker peptides that interconnect the a-domains. these regions include the acidic linker peptide between pro <dig>  and lys <dig> ; the c-terminal peptide from lys <dig> to arg <dig> within the a2-domain.

in this paper, we developed the solvent-equilibrated b-domainless solution structures of zymogen fviii and its activated form, fviiia, in several stages starting from one of the x-ray crystal structures   <cit>  by refining the models using md simulations in explicit water. the development of the full solution structure of fviii zymogen followed the modeling and refinement of two key regions: 1) refinement of the core region of the protein for which the crystal coordinates are available; 2) prediction of the structures for two acidic rich linker peptides interconnecting the a1:a <dig> and a2:a <dig> domains for which the coordinates are not available. the solvent equilibrated solution structures of fviii and fviiia predicted that the active and zymogenic forms may have significant conformational differences around the putative fixa binding site in the a <dig> domain. while the proposed structure of the linker peptide between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains is predictive in nature and requires experimental validation, they corroborate well with the existing hypothesis that the exposure of the putative fixa binding loop  in the a2-domain is critical for productive interactions with fixa enzyme during the intrinsic tenase  complex formation. a detailed account of the intra and inter-domain interactions among the five domains and a correlation with known biochemical mutagenesis data is presented.

RESULTS
human fviii model in the current study was built using the  <dig>  Å resolution x-ray crystal structure of fviii published by shen et al  <cit> . another x-ray crystal structure with  <dig>  Å resolution using similar synthetic construct and crystal form was published  <cit> . both models were built based on fitting the homology models of fviii into the electron density map of fviii x-ray crystallographic space . the alignment of the backbone atoms of the two structures revealed significant conformational differences in several solvent-exposed loop regions, though the core region of the both structures was similar with an overall rms difference of  <dig>  Å for the backbone atoms. the fixa binding loop  within the a2-domain and the surrounding region was also markedly different in both crystal structures. this region was implicated in several experimental studies as functionally important for fviiia:fixa interactions as well as thrombin interactions with fviii during the activation. the a1-a2-a <dig> domains of fviii share ~35% sequence identity with the structure of human ceruloplasmin, from which the x-ray structural models were built. it is not surprising that such low sequence identity reflected on the poor stereo-chemical quality of the crystal structures. the analysis of the ramachandran plot showed that the initial x-crystal structure has ~ <dig> residues  as the outliers in the phi-psi dihedral space . in contrast, the md equilibrated fviii zymogen structure, corresponding to  <dig> ns of md trajectory, showed marked improvement in the stereochemical quality with only three non-glycine residues  as the outliers in the ramachandran plot. these residues are located in the solvent-exposed loop regions and some residues appeared to vary from one snapshot of md trajectory to the other, perhaps representing the conformational sub-states. the overall structure of fviii showed  <dig> % of the residues in the generously allowed region of the ramachandran plot. similarly, the solution structure of fviiia showed  <dig> % of the residues in the most favorable region with only four non-glycine residues in the outlier region. the evaluation of the "goodness of fit" of the model in comparison with the proteins in the crystal structure database by prosa server  <cit> https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php ranked the md derived fviii zymogen model with a z-score of - <dig>  and that of the fviiia structure with the corresponding score of - <dig> . these values were considerably less than the maximum acceptable value of - <dig>  when compared with the range of native conformations of the pdb templates. the corresponding z-score of the x-ray structure was - <dig>  . the domain-wise alignment of the starting x-ray crystal structure with the md derived model showed overall agreement in the core-region of the domains but significant differences in the domain-domain interface in the a-domains. the superimposed structures are shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the structures of the fviii zymogen and its activated forms, corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> ns of md snapshots respectively, are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> with highlighting the important regions in the proteins.

in order to understand the overall dynamics of the structures, we monitored the structural changes over the simulation time by computing the rms deviations with reference to the starting structure . the rms deviations of fviii were much larger when we considered all the five domains, but relatively stable when plotted the a1-a1-a3-c <dig> domains combined excluding the c <dig> domain. this difference can be attributed to the flexibility of the c2-domain than the other four domains. despite the large binding surface between the c <dig> and the adjacent c <dig> domain, the two domains do not have energetically significant inter-domain interactions between them . we have generated  <dig> possible models of fviii and fviiia by clustering the last  <dig> ns of the md trajectory. the backbone superimposed structures of the  <dig> models for both forms are presented in figure  <dig>  it is evident from the figure that while the a1-a2-a3-c <dig> domains appeared relatively stable, the c2-domain showed significant flexibility in both the structures. also, it is evident from the figure that the a2-a <dig> peptide linker region showed some degree of flexibility in the zymogenic form. the c-terminus of the a2-domain in the activated form that is mostly occupied by negatively charged residues also showed large flexibility.

to probe the intra and inter-domain mobility of the solvent-exposed loop regions further, we computed the atomic positional fluctuations in fviii and fviiia models. a comparative plot of the positional fluctuations averaged over the last  <dig> ns of md trajectory is shown for the a1-a <dig> and a3-c1-c <dig> domains in figures 6a,b. atomic positional fluctuations are often used to characterize the domain flexibility in multi-domain protein systems as well as to understand the hyper-variability of the solvent exposed loop regions. typically, the loops that have positional fluctuations more than  <dig> Å <dig> may be considered hyper-variable in the protein structures. in experimental x-ray crystal structures, the b-factors usually provide such information. while it is difficult to quantitatively relate the positional fluctuations from md simulations with that of experimental b-factors in the x-ray crystal structures, both share a qualitative comparison. since the published x-ray crystal structure of fviii was derived by fitting the homology models, the crystallographic b-factors were assigned > <dig> Å <dig> of positional uncertainty. consequently we could not make direct comparison with the computed atomic positional fluctuations. it is evident from figures 6a,b that the overall flexibility of the solvent-exposed loop regions is very similar in both zymogen and activated forms. in line with the rmsd plot , the conformational flexibility of the c <dig> domain  is clearly evident in both fviii and fviiia with more than  <dig> Å <dig> of the atomic positional fluctuations. the acidic linker peptide region between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains spanning the residues pro <dig> and lys <dig>  the loop regions 21- <dig>  397- <dig>  594- <dig>  1713- <dig>  1796- <dig> and 1889- <dig> exhibited relatively large mobility during the md simulations.

discussion
structure and conformation of a1/a <dig> and a2/a <dig> linker peptides
in the present study, the acidic-rich linker peptide connecting the residues cys <dig> of a1-domain and thr <dig> of a2-domain was derived based on md simulations for a total time of  <dig> ns. though the starting structure for the loop optimization was based on a linear conformation, over the md refinement, the linker peptide adopted helical structure for two acidic rich regions. the helices correspond to the sequence edysulfdddltd from glu <dig> to asp <dig> and the activation peptide sequence sfiqir from ser <dig> to arg <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  the linker peptide conformation was stabilized, as may be seen from rms plot , with three ion-pair interactions with the a <dig> and a <dig> domains. these correspond to interactions of glu332:asp302; arg336:asp302/glu <dig> and arg359:asp <dig>  the two helices are connected to the a <dig> and a <dig> domains by largely flexible structure with no specific secondary structure. the predicted helical structure for glu344-asp <dig> may have a functional significance as this region was implicated to have a potential role in recognizing the substrate fx by the tenase complex . in order to verify that the helical preference for the two proposed regions between a <dig> and a <dig> domains is reproducible, we carried out two independent md simulations on the peptides correspond to the residues arg336-met <dig> and val359-thr <dig> for  <dig> ns . both structures converged over the simulation period to helical conformation . the reproducibility of the helical nature of the two proposed regions assures the reproducibility of the structure prediction for the two acidic patches.

the linker peptide connecting cys <dig>  and thr <dig>  in the b-domainless fviii form was modeled based on a truncated model between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains as described in the modeling section. the residues at the c-terminus end of a <dig> domain are predominantly acidic with three tyrosine residues at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that were post-translationally sulfated. in addition, the residue  <dig> at the junction of a2-a <dig> domain is also sulfated. the a2-a <dig> linker peptide was stabilized over the  <dig> ns of md simulations as shown in the rmsd plot . the last  <dig> ns of the md trajectories were clustered into  <dig> conformations and are shown in figure 8b. it is evident from the figure that the optimized loop structure shows significant flexibility with the acidic patch of residues at the c-terminus of the a2-domain form a stable hairpin-like structure with the sulfated tyrosines projecting out to the surface.

structural features of metal ions in factor viii/viiia
the function and stability of the fviii depend critically on metal ions, particularly calcium and copper ions, covalently bound to the protein. studies based on the reconstitution of isolated subunits as well as site-specific mutagenesis studies indicated that type-i  and type-ii  ions covalently bind to factor viii. these studies suggested that the primary role for copper  was to enhance the inter-chain affinity by ~ <dig> fold  <cit> . it was also showed that the type-i copper  bound to the inter-domain interface is not sufficient alone to regenerate the full co-factor activity but might need a calcium ion binding to augment the stability of the structure. however, the precise location of the calcium ion binding, probably a low-affinity binding site as suggested by wakabayashi et al, is not yet experimentally characterized  <cit> . it is also interesting that the calcium ion, itself, has little effect on inter-subunit affinity yet converts the inactive dimer to an active form  <cit> . while high  concentrations of cu fail to support fviii reconstitution, low  levels of cu or cu stimulate reconstitution in the presence of calcium or manganese ions  <cit> . activity generation due to calcium ion binding to fviii was shown to be a slow process and thus a slow conformational transition may be involved  <cit> . results from factor xa generation experiments suggested that fviii might possess two calcium-binding sites with differing binding affinities. a high affinity calcium ion was proposed to bind to a1-domain with kd value of  <dig> - <dig>  μm while a low-affinity site was proposed to bind to an unknown site with a weak kd value of  <dig>  mm  <cit> .

calcium-ion coordination
several early mutagenesis studies have suggested that the a1-domain region spanning residues 110- <dig> constitute a calcium-ion binding site  <cit> . the loop has eight acidic residues  providing an ideal site for calcium coordination. in the starting x-ray crystal structure, one calcium ion was located in the a <dig> domain with coordination to the side-chain oxygen atom of asp <dig> and the backbone oxygen atom of ala <dig>  no other coordinating oxygen atoms were located within the  <dig> Å vicinity of the calcium atom. the calcium ion has been well characterized in several blood coagulation proteins to bind to three to four amino acids to maintain an octahedral coordination network  <cit> . experimental alanine mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the mutation of glu <dig>  asp <dig>  glu <dig>  asp <dig> or asp <dig> led to significant reduction  in ca2+ binding affinity  <cit> . in contrast, the ala-substitution at glu <dig>  asp <dig> or glu <dig> showed wild-type-like activity with little or no reduction in calcium ion affinity. to be consistent with the experimental data, we placed a calcium ion in the a1-domain loop with initial coordination optimally close to the side-chain carboxylate groups of all possible negatively charged residues . over the course of molecular dynamics simulation, the calcium ion developed a stable octahedral co-ordination network with the side-chain carboxylate group atoms od <dig> and od <dig> of asp <dig>  oe <dig>  oe <dig> atoms of glu <dig> and od <dig> of asp <dig>  three oxygen atoms from the solvent water were also involved in completing the coordination network . the coordination network of calcium ion in the a1-domain is identical in both active and zymogenic forms of fviii.

as mentioned previously, it was proposed in biochemical studies that fviii might also have a second low-affinity calcium ion bound to the a-domains that contribute to the inter-domain affinity. while there was no structural data so far to characterize such interaction, the current md simulations predicted, for the first time, a stable calcium ion binding to the interface of a <dig> and a <dig> domains. the simulation setup of fviii and fviiia contained several calcium ions in the water solvent that were not bound to the protein. within the initial  <dig> ns of the simulation period, one of the calcium ions from the solvent emerged to appear close to glu <dig> of a2-domain and glu <dig> of a3-domain residues and developed a stable octahedral coordination network with the side-chain oxygen atoms  of the carboxylate groups together with four oxygen atoms of the solvent water molecules . while the structural and functional relevance of the second calcium ion is not known, the simulations suggest that this might be considered as the second low-affinity calcium-ion binding to the fviii protein that involves a <dig> and a <dig> domains with glu <dig> and glu <dig> residues. perhaps mutation of either or both residues by experimental mutagenesis studies might further clarify the role of the second calcium ion in the proposed site.

copper ions coordination
factor viii is structurally homologous to the copper-binding human ceruloplasmin and factor va  <cit> . the comparison of the three structures, together with the biophysical and experimental mutagenesis data  <cit> , suggests that two type-i  copper ions bind to the a <dig> and a <dig> domains. the reconstitution of fviii from isolated heavy and light chains revealed a primary role for copper ion was to enhance the inter-chain affinity by ~ <dig> fold  <cit> . it is known, in many copper binding proteins, that the copper ion coordinates with a network of residues comprising his/cys/met or with his/his/his network  <cit> . in factor viii, two such ideal sites exist within the a <dig> and a <dig> domains. these sites are: his267/cys310/his315/met <dig> in a1-domain and his1954/cys2000/met2010/his <dig> in a3-domain. also, a his99/his161/his <dig> network was found between a <dig> and a <dig> domains. the site-specific mutagenesis studies have indicated that the cys310ser mutation in the a1-domain showed marked reduction in the specific activity of fviiia. in contrast, the a3-domain mutations cys2000ser and his1957ala did not affect factor viii specific activity where as the a1-domain mutation his99ala yielded ~75% reduction compared to the wild-type. while some of these studies provided a conflicting view of the role of copper ion co-ordination, it is noteworthy that the mutagenesis studies were based on single-point mutations. within the a <dig> and a <dig> domains, the copper is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms of histidines and side-chain sulfur atoms of cys and met residues. it is possible that the binding affinity might not be altered to noticeable effect by mutating single-residue, while the other three residues could be sufficient to hold the copper-coordination network. the coordination network of the copper ions with the md derived model is shown in figures 10a-c. the ions maintained a stable coordination network during the simulation period. the histidine ring nitrogen atoms of his <dig>  his <dig> of the a <dig> domain and his <dig> of the a3-domain are coordinated with copper ion with the bond distance of ~ <dig>  Å. the copper ions within the a <dig> and a <dig> domains coordinated with the side-chain sulfur atoms of cys and met residues with the coordination distance of  <dig>  Å while the histidine nitrogen atoms are at  <dig>  Å distance.

post-translational modification sites
the b-domainless fviii contains five asn-glycosylation  sites. these sites are located in a <dig> , a <dig>  and a <dig>  and c <dig>  domains  <cit> . all the five sites were modified to n-glnac linked carbohydrate attachments. the solution-structure showed that except for asn <dig>  all the modified asparagines residues are solvent exposed. the asn <dig> residue is somewhat buried in the deep cleft between the a <dig> and c <dig> domains.

there are six tyrosine sulfation sites in fviii. these are located at the positions:  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and at  <dig>  and  <dig> in the c-terminus end of the a <dig> domain  <cit> . except for tyr <dig> which is not present in our model , rest of the tyrosine residues were present in surface-loop regions with complete exposure of the side-chains to the solvent. the negatively charged sulfated tyrosines were implicated to have direct influence on the thrombin activation rates of fviii. for instance, the mutation tyr346phe, located within the a1-a <dig> acidic linker peptide, accelerated the rate of fviii cleavage by thrombin  <cit> . in contrast, the mutation of tyr346cys results in crm+ hemophilia a  <cit> . this defect was characterized by a discrepancy in one-state and two-stage clotting assays and the pathological implications were due to reduced activation rates. in the model of fviii zymogen, the tyr346sulf is located within the α-helix formed by the acidic-rich sequence edysulfdddltd . one direct impact of tyr346suf mutation to cysteine could be the reduction of overall acidic nature of the helix and possibly destabilizing the helix. it may also be seen from figures  <dig> and  <dig> that the sulfated tyrosine residues at  <dig>  and  <dig> together with aspartic acid residues at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> generate a high density of acidic cluster with the hairpin-like loop at the c-terminus of a2-domain. this region was shown in experimental studies as a likely thrombin exosite binding region during the proteolysis of arg372-ser <dig> and/or arg740-ser <dig> peptide bonds  <cit> 

inter-domain interactions in fviii/fviiia
the structural stability originating from the inter-domain interactions of fviii/fviiia is mainly due to the metal ion dependent association and the inter-chain association due to residue-level interactions. indeed, 80% of the thermodynamic stability of fviii is attributed to the latter. upon the generation of the fviiia followed by the cleavages at three proteolytic sites in b-domainless fviii, the activated form has limited half-life since it goes through the spontaneous inactivation through a <dig> subunit dissociation from the other domains  <cit> . while the specific structural rationale is not clear, the interactions between a <dig> and other domains were believed to be weak and limited  <cit> . an accurate account of atomic level interactions is critical to understand the origins of stability as well as to provide a structural correlation to the known genetic or synthetic mutation data. the detailed interaction data among the a-domains of fviii/fviiia is tabulated in table 1based on the equilibrated structures derived from the md simulation data. in order to estimate the binding surface between fviii domains, we computed the solvent-accessible surface area  using naccess program  <cit>  with a probe radius of  <dig>  Å. we estimated that the total surface area of fviii and fviiia are  <dig> and  <dig> Å <dig> respectively. the buried surface area among the a-domains  is as follows: a1:a <dig> ; a2:a <dig>  and a1:a <dig> .

a1-a <dig> binding surface
analysis of the interaction data showed significant contribution form several ion-pair interactions that promote stability between a <dig> and a <dig> domains as shown in table  <dig>  some key interactions include the ion-pairs: arg282:asp525; arg484:glu272; arg490:glu341; lys493:asp318/glu <dig> and lys512:glu <dig>  apart from these major contributions, several hydrogen bond interactions were identified at the binding surface between a <dig> and a <dig> domains. it is worth-mentioning that the interaction data from present md models correlate well with the published experimental mutagenesis data. in a recently study on the characterization of a-domain residues that contribute to the fviii/fviiia stability, wakabayashi and fay investigated a panel of mutations that contribute to the a2-domain affinity with a <dig> and a <dig> domains  <cit> . they concluded from the study that the decay of fviii stability depends on the specific residues in the decreasing order of: arg <dig> > ser <dig> > asn <dig> > arg <dig> > ser <dig> > glu <dig> > tyr <dig> > his <dig>  these mutations showed marked decrease in the protein stability relative to the wild-type fviii in a one-stage clotting assay and two-stage chromogenic factor xa generation assay. the design of these experiments was based on a homology model of a1-a2-a <dig> domains derived from human ceruloplasmin template that shares ~35% sequence identity with fviii. comparison of our md model with the homology model showed significant differences in the inter-domain surface and perhaps the effect of some of the proposed mutations could be due to the direct/indirect influence of some of the neighboring residues than the specific mutations proposed in their experimental work.

the mutations of arg <dig>  ser <dig> and arg <dig> were shown to increase the fviii decay by > 5-fold. as shown in table  <dig>  the arg <dig> is ion-paired with asp <dig> and the arg282ala mutation would impact the binding interactions between a <dig> and a <dig> domains. while the effect of asp <dig> mutation was not studied, the neighboring residue ser <dig> is located in the same loop that asp <dig> resides. the ser524ala mutation was also shown to significantly increase the fviii decay. this residue is solvent exposed in the model of fviii and perhaps alanine mutation would effect the loop conformation that might, in turn, alter the conformation of asp <dig> and consequently the ion-pair interaction with arg <dig>  it is also worth mentioning the ion-pair interaction between arg <dig> and asp <dig>  the arg531ala mutation was shown to affect the inter-domain affinity. while this residue is not involved in the inter-domain interactions, it forms ion-pair with asp <dig> which is located in the same loop segment that arg <dig> is located. thus, the arg <dig> mutation would impair interactions with asp <dig> that might have structural consequence in affecting the stability of arg285:asp <dig> interactions.

a1-a <dig> binding surface
despite the relatively smaller binding surface compared to that of a1:a <dig> domains, the a <dig> and a <dig> domains are largely stabilized by the copper ion coordination at the a <dig> and a <dig> domain interface. in addition, four major ion-pair interactions add to the overall binding affinity between the two domains. these are arg220:glu1914; arg221:arg1719; arg226:asp <dig> and glu113:arg <dig>  it should be noted that the glu <dig> is located in the calcium-binding loop within the a <dig> domain. the mutagenesis studies suggested that the glu113ala mutation within this calcium binding loop showed four-fold increase in co-factor activity. while the mutation of glu <dig> to large polar residues was shown to be detrimental to the co-factor activity, glu113ala mutation seems to increase the stability. in our structure, we identify that the backbone oxygen atom of glu <dig> forms hydrogen-bonding with two hydrogen atoms of the side-chain of arg <dig> within the a3-domain. we observed that this interaction was consistently maintained over the entire stabilized md trajectory and, indeed, was the only inter-domain interaction that contribute to the association of the calcium binding loop to the a3-domain. therefore, the mutation of glu <dig> into other bulky groups might disrupt this interaction and could be deleterious to the inter-domain affinity between a <dig> and a <dig> domains.

a2-a <dig> binding surface
the interactions between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains in fviii zymogen are governed by a large number of hydrogen bonded interactions. the a2:a <dig> surface has three ion-pair interactions due to the clustered network of charged residues arg740:glu378/glu1811; lys1833:asp666/tyr664; glu607:arg1900/ala <dig>  unlike the a1:a <dig> and a1:a <dig> domains that did not show a great loss of inter-domain interactions upon activation, the a2:a <dig> domain interface appears to loose a large number of hydrogen bonds  as seen from the table  <dig>  these differences reflected on the corresponding loss of  <dig> Å <dig> surface area in the activated form when compared with that of the zymogen. the a2-subunit dissociation in the activated form and the reduced half-life in the blood plasma could be attributed, at least in part, to the diminished interactions between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains. in a study based on the glu1829ala mutation, the a3-domain residue glu <dig> was proposed to contribute to the a <dig> subunit retention  <cit> . in the zymogen structure, we noticed that the residue was bonded to the backbone oxygen atom of arg <dig> of a3-domain. a similar observation can be seen in the reported x-ray crystal structure of fviii  <cit> . however, glu <dig> is located in the loop that has direct interactions with the a2-domain interface. at the interface, tyr <dig> of a2-domain is observed to have hydrophobic interactions with phe <dig> residue of a3-domain via π-π stacking. thus, the mutation of glu <dig> could be seen as the neighbor-effect in reducing the a2:a <dig> domain interactions. the asp666ala mutation was shown to increase the fviii decay rates  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  asp <dig> residue is bonded to lys <dig> though ion-pair.

interactions of c1-c <dig> domains with a1-a2-a <dig> domains
the platelet binding c-domains together share  <dig> Å <dig> of buried surface with the a1/a2/a <dig> domains. despite the large binding surface, the c-domains have limited stabilizing interactions with the a-domains. we noticed that only one clustered ion-pair formation of glu <dig> with arg <dig> and tyr <dig>  other h-bonding interactions include arg4:tyr2332; ala1866:ser2119; glu1754:gln2113; arg2116:thr <dig> and tyr2115:pro <dig>  interestingly, the c1-domain shares  <dig> Å <dig> of surface area with c2-domain but no hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions were found between the two domains. as discussed in the early part of the text, the large-scale domain motions, that we observed  when all the domains are considered, stems for the lack of stabilizing interactions between the c <dig> and c <dig> domains. as the c1-c <dig> domains seem to bind to the platelet surface together, the overall structure of fviiia might adopt a stabilizing orientation, for functional co-factor activity, on the anionic phospholipids surface through the likely hydrophobic interactions with c1-c <dig> domain residues phe <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig> and met <dig> residues. all these residues are projected towards the possible membrane surface.

structural differences between zymogenic and activated forms
the b-domainless factor viii zymogen has three proteolytic sites at arg <dig> , arg <dig>  and arg <dig>  that must be cleaved by the physiological activator, thrombin  <cit> . while the precise order of the cleavages is not well-known, the proteolysis of arg372-ser <dig> peptide bond is believed to be penultimate step in the activation process of the zymogen and is essential for full co-factor activity of fviiia. recent biochemical studies suggested that the proteolysis at either arg <dig> or arg <dig> facilitates subsequent bond cleavages during the thrombin catalyzed activation  <cit> . the arg372-ser <dig> site is located in the linker peptide that has several acidic residues between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains. while the structural rationale behind the essential pre-requisite of the cleavage of arg372-ser <dig> peptide bond is not known, it was hypothesized that the cleavage of the bond exposes a cryptic functional factor ixa-interactive site in the a2-domain  <cit> . the acidic linker peptide conformation in the solvent-equilibrated zymogen model adopts the conformation that blocks the tyr555-asp <dig> loop in the a <dig> domain . the arg372-ser <dig> cleavage site can be clearly seen to mask the fixa binding site in the zymogen model. in the factor x activating complex fixa/fviiia, residues 555- <dig> of the a <dig> domain are thought to bind to the protease domain of factor ixa  <cit> . in another study, it was also proposed that helix 330- <dig> of fixa interacts with 555- <dig> loop of a2-domain  <cit> . taken the data together, it becomes apparent from the current zymogen model that the activation peptide loop between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains blocks the complex formation between fviii and fixa. based on md simulations on fviiia, in which the arg372-ser <dig> bond gets cleaved, our model of fviiia predicts that the cleaved peptide linker between a <dig> and a <dig> domains undergoes significant conformational changes upon activation. indeed the peptide segment pro330-arg <dig>  in the activated form, completely restructures and relocates to the a1-domain . this conformational reorganization leads to full exposure of the putative fixa binding site within the a2-domain for productive complex formation between the fixa enzyme and fviiia co-factor. we must emphasize that the proposed linker peptide between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains is truly predictive in nature, albeit sheds some light on the likely conformation that the peptide linker might adopt. whether the proposed conformation for the linker structure is indeed true or not can only be attested by experimental validation. considering that we were able to reproduce the helical nature for the  <dig> residue long acidic patch and the short peptide preceding the proteolytic site may instill some confidence in the proposed structure.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we applied a step-wise modeling and md refinement approach to develop the solution structural models of the zymogenic and activated forms of b-domainless human factor viii based on the x-ray crystal structure of human fviii. the models showed significant improvement in the stereochemical quality of the core region of the domains over the x-ray crystal structure. the solvent equilibrated models derived from several hundred nanoseconds of md simulations in explicit water provided a detailed understanding of the dynamics of the multi-domain assembly. structural defects in fviii lead to the hereditary bleeding disorder, hemophilia-a. more than  <dig> natural mutations are known that cause mild to severe bleeding in hemophilia patients. while a detailed structure-function correlation of the known genetic and synthetic mutations with fviii/fviiia structures is beyond the scope of the present work, we were able to successfully correlate some of the recently reported experimental mutagenesis data with the md derived models.

in the absence of experimental structural data, we applied md simulation techniques to predict the likely conformations for the linker peptides between the a1:a <dig> and a2:a <dig> domains. though the models are derived from long time scale md simulations and appear to be well-stabilized during the dynamics, we must emphasize that the loop conformations are truly predictive in nature and need experimental attestation. however the proposed model for the linker peptide between a <dig> and a <dig> domains may shed some light on the current understanding of the zymogenicity of fviii. the linker peptide between a <dig> and a <dig> domains was predicted to block the "steric access" of the putative factor ixa binding region  in the a2-domain. the simulation of the activated form predicted that the loop re-organizes upon cleavage and relocates to a <dig> domain, thereby exposing the tyr555-asp <dig> loop and the surrounding region. since this loop was proposed by several experimental studies as functionally important for fixa enzyme binding, the conformational differences between fviii and fviiia in the current study may provide a structural basis for the zymogenecity of fviii and the importance of the proteolysis of arg372-ser <dig> peptide bond for productive interactions between fixa and fviiia. the extensive md simulations employed in the current study also characterize the specific residues involved in the co-ordination network of the high-affinity calcium-ion within the a1-domain. the proposed data related to the inter-domain interactions may serve as a reasonable structural basis to design the site-specific mutagenesis studies to further characterize the residues involved in promoting the overall stability of fviii/fviiia and, in turn, the validation of the proposed solution structures.
