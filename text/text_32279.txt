BACKGROUND
paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermo-dimorphic pathogenic fungus. it causes paracoccidiodomycosis  in man, which is an endemic mycosis in latin america that affects mostly the lungs, but can disseminate to other organs  <cit> . p. brasiliensis is multinucleated in both pathogenic yeast and infectious mycelial phases. genetic transformation in the species has recently been optimized  <cit> , however genetic manipulation is still in its infancy. it is now recognized that most p. brasiliensis isolates diversified into an s <dig> main species, which is genetically close to the ps <dig> group of colombian isolates, while ps <dig> is composed of a few isolates that constitute a phylogenetically cryptic species  <cit> .

gp <dig> is the main diagnostic and prognostic antigen so far characterized in p. brasiliensis  <cit> . it is a secretory glycoprotein whose peptide structure bears antigenic properties that are peculiar to the species  <cit> . therefore, it confers high levels of sensitivity and specificity for pcm patients' sera when used as antigen in diagnostic tests such as immunodiffusion and capture elisa, as well as by antigen detection in biological fluids  <cit> . antibody titers are directly proportional to the severity of active pcm; they are probably not protective in advanced stages of the disease, but experimental protocols in mice point to the immunotherapeutic potential of anti-gp <dig> monoclonal antibodies  <cit> . on the other hand, gp <dig> contains t cell epitopes that are protective to vaccinated mice  <cit> . the best studied t-cell epitope is  <dig> aminoacid-long p- <dig>  which showed additive effect in the treatment of murine pcm when administered with anti-fungal agents  <cit> . in addition, gp <dig> has adhesive properties to extracellular matrix proteins that may help fungal dissemination  <cit> .

the complete pbgp <dig> orf has originally been found in a cloned  <dig> -bp ecori genomic region from the pb <dig>  isolate. it comprises  <dig>  bp that contain a unique 78-bp intron  <cit> . the ecori genomic fragment includes  <dig> bp from the pbgp <dig> 5' intergenic proximal region and about  <dig> bp of the 3' intergenic sequence, which is shared by a neighboring ranbp homologue. this gene encodes a nuclear ran-binding protein in schizosaccharomyces pombe, or importin  <dig> in aspergillus fumigatus, that transports ribosomal proteins to the nucleus  <cit> . pbgp <dig> and pbranbp are linked in twelve p. brasiliensis isolates, as observed by feitosa et al.  <cit> .

our group has carried out original and detailed studies on sequence polymorphism in the pbgp <dig> orf  <cit>  and 5' intergenic proximal region  <cit> , which defined at least five genotypes  <cit> . when compared to a consensus sequence, the most polymorphic a genotype carries three substitutions in the 5' intergenic proximal region and up to fifteen informative sites in the orf, mostly concentrated in exon  <dig>  so far, the a genotype has been detected in all six ps <dig> isolates  <cit> . it is of note that pbgp <dig> was the most polymorphic gene in the multilocus analysis performed by matute et al.  <cit>  in p. brasiliensis. isolates pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  which belong in ps <dig> group  <cit> , evoked milder experimental pcm in b <dig>  a mice than representative isolates from the main species s <dig>  including pb <dig>  <cit> . this isolate has been long used in experimental pcm due to its high virulence.

p. brasiliensis pb <dig> has traditionally been employed in antigen preparation  <cit> . it secretes high amounts of gp <dig>  however that is not a rule among isolates  <cit> . the amount of gp <dig> accumulated in the extracellular fluids of a single isolate also varies with incubation time, culture medium, fungal phase, as well as with multiple sub-culturing after animal passage. in yeast-phase pb <dig>  extracellular gp <dig> decreases through late-log and stationary phases  <cit> , when the culture ph tends to be basic  <cit> . expression regulation of gp <dig> is only beginning to be unrevealed. previous data from our group suggested that pbgp <dig> suffers transcriptional regulation, but we showed that modulation at protein and secretion levels might also happen  <cit> . besides, transcriptional response of pb <dig> isolate to heat shock differed from others belonging to p. brasiliensis s <dig> group, suggesting that differences in pbgp <dig> transcriptional regulation are likely to occur among isolates  <cit> . on the other hand, we have recently mapped nit2-like binding motifs in the pbgp <dig> 5' intergenic region and described transcription modulation with nitrogen primary sources. in that case, the degree of modulation was similar among different isolates  <cit> .

differences in gp <dig> expression could be related to differences in transcription regulation due to genetic polymorphisms in the pbgp <dig> flanking regions. in the present work, we found protein binding sequences in the proximal pbgp <dig> 5' flanking fragment and studied the effect of substitution sites; we characterized an extended 5' intergenic region up to  <dig>  bp from pb <dig> in comparison with other isolates and recognized some peculiar sequence organization. in addition, we studied polymorphism in the 3' utr and polyadenylation cleavage site of the pbgp <dig> transcript. accumulation of pbgp <dig> transcripts was much higher in pb <dig> than in pb <dig> and pb <dig>  however they were similarly modulated with glucose. the differences we presently found in the pb <dig> 5' intergenic region might help understand the features involved in differences of pbgp <dig> transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS
search for dna binding regions in the proximal pbgp <dig> 5' flanking region
in order to find protein binding sites within the proximal 5' flanking region of the pbgp <dig> gene cloned by cisalpino et al.  <cit>  we carried out emsa using total protein extracts of p. brasiliensis and selected oligonucleotides . selection was based on the search for transcription factors using the tfsearch program  and dnase i protection footprinting assays , as established in our previous works  <cit> . we were aware of the incomplete type of information that transcription factor search programs could provide; however that was the strategy of choice to start our analysis. we were particularly interested to find dna binding sequences in polymorphic regions.

the first set of probes tested by emsa included bs <dig>  bs <dig> , bs <dig> Δ, bs <dig> Δ and bs <dig> . bs <dig> and bs <dig> resulted negative , while the overlapping oligonucleotides bs <dig> , bs <dig> Δ and bs <dig> Δ  formed intense shifted bands that were specifically inhibited with 100-fold excess of cold homologous probes, suggesting specificity . oligonucleotides bs <dig> Δ and bs <dig> Δ  included substitutions at positions - <dig>  and/or - <dig>  that are characteristic of p. brasiliensis isolates belonging to phylogenetic species ps <dig>  which is presently represented by pb <dig>  <cit> . however, these substitutions did not seem to alter the intensity of protein binding . in addition, probes bs <dig> , bs <dig> Δ and bs <dig> Δ cross-competed . the bs <dig> , bs <dig> Δ and bs <dig> Δ complexes migrated similarly and the probes are similar in size , suggesting binding to the same protein. therefore, our results point to a protein binding core in the overlapping sequence tgcagaa/tttatcaa. alternatively, all the probes are competing for distinct sox-5-like protein binding sites . it is necessary to point out, however, that all the interpretations drawn from emsa using total protein extracts will only possibly be confirmed by using either purified transcription factors or specific antibodies in super-shift experiments, considering that differences in shifts could be evoked by the same protein, while similar migrations could alternatively be the result of different transcription factors.

the next set of probes tested by emsa included et <dig>  et <dig>  et23Δ, et <dig> and et <dig> . we tested these regions based on apparent protection in dnase i protection footprinting assays . in emsa, probes et <dig> and et <dig> formed only weak and unspecific complexes with p. brasiliensis total protein extracts , although these regions are rich in predicted transcription elements . we also tested an et <dig> variant that had five extra upstream nucleotides. emsa results were still negative, suggesting that the nit <dig> motif predicted in this probe  is not functional.

overlapping et <dig> and et <dig> oligonucleotides  formed intense complexes that co-migrated and could be specifically inhibited with 100-fold excess of cold homologous probe . in cross-competition emsa experiments, cold et <dig> strongly competed with et <dig>  preventing band shift with as little as 100-fold molar excess. cold et <dig> was a weaker competitor to et <dig> binding, since a noticeable decrease in band intensity demanded 500-fold molar excess of et <dig> . the results with pb <dig> extracts presented in figures 3a and 3b were similar with extracts from pb <dig> and pb <dig> , suggesting that the same protein in each isolate binds to both probes; however affinity for et <dig> is possibly higher. therefore, a dna binding motif might include the overlapping region from nt - <dig> to - <dig> , for which there are no motifs recognized by the tfsearch computer program . we also designed an et23Δ probe to verify the influence in emsa of substitution at - <dig> . we initially noticed that the et23Δ band was reproducibly less intense than the et <dig> band when assayed with protein extracts from pb <dig>  and pb <dig> , but equally intense with pb <dig> extracts . in terms of competition with the et <dig> complex, et23Δ was as good a competitor as et <dig>  while cold et <dig> could apparently inhibit band formation with et23Δ more effectively than with et <dig> . therefore, a c  at position - <dig> seems to be important for stronger pb <dig> protein binding to et <dig> 

manual search through the pbgp <dig> promoter region revealed the existence of two crea-like dna binding motifs , whose sequences  are observed in the et <dig> and et <dig> probes . crea is a zinc-finger catabolic repressor in a. nidulans  <cit>  and we tested the probes with pb <dig> extracts. we obtained an intense emsa-positive band with et <dig> that could only be removed with a  <dig> -fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide, suggesting lack of specificity . et <dig> formed only a faint band that disappeared upon competition with 250-fold molar excess of cold probe .

analysis of  <dig>  bp from the pbgp <dig> 5' flanking region
in our laboratory, we had long been trying to clone an extended fragment of the 5' intergenic region of the pbgp <dig> gene using different methods and pb <dig> as reference isolate. recently, we have finally managed to increase sequence information of this region to - <dig>  bp , which prompted us to search for length polymorphism in other isolates . in order to do that, we compared pcr fragments amplified with p <dig>  and grn  primers  and dna template from  <dig> isolates . note that amplicons from pb <dig>  pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> had similar sizes of around  <dig>  bp; amplicons from pb <dig> and pb <dig> were around  <dig>  bp, while those from pb <dig>  pb <dig>  pb <dig>  pb <dig>  pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> were similar to the original pb <dig> fragment migrating at about  <dig>  bp.

we next sequenced the pb <dig> shorter pcr product; at a similar time frame the p. brasiliensis genome from isolates pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> was released http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/multihome.html. therefore, we had a chance to compare our sequences with those analyzed by the broad institute and the results are summarized in figure  <dig> 

we detected in pb <dig> the presence of three consecutive repetitive regions: 1a , 1b  and 1c , which are about 500-bp long . two of the regions have initially been detected due to the difficulties to arrange the contigs generated through primer walking sequencing. a middle similar region has only been revealed very recently after further analysis of the data during preparation of this manuscript. the 1c region lacks an initial 58-bp fragment upstream , which is identical in 1a and 1b . in pb <dig>  identities between regions are 89% , 79%  and 90% . in pb <dig>  the structure and sequence of the pbgp <dig> 5' flanking region  are quite similar to those in pb <dig>  sequence identities are also high when comparing the same regions between pb <dig> and pb18: 99% , 95%  and 97% . pb <dig> lacks one repetitive region: 1a in pb <dig> is 96% identical to 1a in pb <dig>  while 1c/a/b carries nucleotides characteristic of the three regions, however the level of identity is higher with 1c  than with 1b  or 1a . therefore, when sequence alignments of the repetitive regions from pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> were compared in a dendrogram, there were two main clusters, one with 1a sequences and another branching into 1b and 1c  regions . pb <dig> sequences formed individual branches, in accordance with the phylogenetically distinct nature of this isolate detected with pbgp <dig> gene and other loci  <cit> . the 442-bp upstream fragment is highly divergent from the repetitive regions, but conserved among isolates .

the highly conserved nature of the connector  drove our attention to a more detailed analysis of its contents. we observed that some oligonucleotide sequences occur exclusively in the connectors, while others can be found in other positions of the repetitive regions. in figure 4c, we boxed six sequences  that can be found in the positions represented in figure 4b by color-coded arrowheads or bars. note that the blue oligonucleotide  was invariably found  <dig> bp upstream of the last base of all repetitive regions. the purple sequence  localized  <dig> bp downstream of the first base of the connector in the three isolates considered; therefore this sequence is not seen in 1c  region. the gray sequence ttgata in the connector could also be seen in 1b region at - <dig>  and - <dig> . the green atgtta oligonucleotide was detected at - <dig>  and - <dig>  and at - <dig> in all isolates. the orange tataga was found exclusively in pb <dig> and pb <dig> at distances of  <dig> and  <dig> bp from the start base of 1a and 1b regions. the red-coded corresponding mutated sequence in pb <dig>  was also detected  <dig> bp upstream of the last base in 1c/b/a region; it is not present in pb <dig> or pb <dig> connector, but it could be detected at distances varying among  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of regions 1a, 1b and 1c last bases.

the brown cttattt initial connector sequence was observed only once in 1a region,  <dig> bp upstream of the last base in pb <dig> and pb <dig>  although this exact sequence is not observed in the pb <dig> connector, which shows a unique cttcatt oligonucleotide not found elsewhere, in this isolate cttattt has been observed twice in 1a region, at  <dig> bp upstream of the last base, and at a polymorphic - <dig> site. as seen in figure 4d, cttattt is seen in protein-binding oligonucleotide et <dig> , near the overlapped fragment with et <dig>  the et12/ <dig> fragment in 1a region is particularly polymorphic when compared to the correspondent sequences in 1b and 1c; it is one of the fingerprints of 1a region. in 1b and 1c regions, this fragment has several putative transcription motifs, as opposed to et12/et <dig> , however we have not tested their protein binding features.

polymorphism in the 3' utr of pbgp43
we compared the 3' utr of the pbgp <dig> gene by analyzing 3' race products from ten isolates. we used total rna as template, which has been purified from p. brasiliensis yeast phase grown in rich medium . we sequenced the inserts of four to ten clones from each isolate and compared the poly cleavage sites. in our hands, the 3' utr was conserved intra and inter individuals, i.e., we have not found substitutions in all the  <dig> fragments sequenced ; however there was extensive polymorphism in the poly cleavage site. out of  <dig> transcripts we found thirteen close, however different poly sites, which varied in number from one to seven per isolate . these sites were located between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and were mostly pyrimidinea, as precluded to occur in yeasts  <cit> . the most common sites were  <dig>  and  <dig> .

total rna pools  used as template in the 3' race reactions were also analyzed for pbgp <dig> expression using real time rt-pcr. the amount of accumulated transcript varied considerably among isolates , from not detected  to highly abundant  or low . there was no correlation between poly cleavage site and pbgp <dig> transcript accumulation in these experiments.

comparative analysis of pbgp <dig> transcription
differences in extracellular gp <dig> expression among different isolates have been reported in the literature  <cit>  and constantly observed in our laboratory. we have previously suggested that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms would contribute to these differences  <cit> . presently, we used pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> in a controlled comparison of transcript accumulation in yeast cells cultivated to logarithmic phase in defined f12/glc medium. at similar cell concentrations for each culture, transcript accumulation was by far higher in pb <dig>  followed by pb <dig> and pb <dig> . we have observed that differences were not apparent upon modulation with primary nitrogen sources, i.e., pbgp <dig> transcript from pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> were negatively modulated with ammonium sulfate at similar rates  <cit> . we presently tested two other types of stimuli in cultures growing in f <dig> medium, specifically, fetal calf serum  and glucose. as observed in figure  <dig>  supplementation with 2% fcs was not able to modulate pbgp <dig> transcript accumulation in  <dig> min. on the other hand, an increase in glucose concentration from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % for  <dig> min evoked a decrease in the relative amount of transcripts of about 70% . this rate of modulation was similar in pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  although the initial amount of transcripts varied considerably among them. this kind of negative expression modulation with glucose would be expected for glucanase genes  <cit> .

discussion
by using emsa and a series of probes covering five regions within the upstream  <dig> bp of the pbgp <dig> orf we managed to identify protein binding sequences between nt - <dig> to - <dig> and nt - <dig> to - <dig>  together, these regions abrogate three substitution sites characteristic of p. brasiliensis ps <dig> isolates: that might not be incidental, since one mutation at - <dig> seemed to alter binding affinity. by using cross-competition assays with overlapping and mutated probes we suggested binding cores located between nt -125/- <dig>  and nt -243/- <dig> . fragment -125/- <dig> bears putative nit <dig> and cdxa binding sites, whereas oligonucleotide from - <dig> to - <dig> could be involved in binding to a so far unknown protein. nit <dig> modulates transcription of genes that encode enzymes involved in the catabolism of nitrogen sources during starvation  <cit> . we have recently studied pbgp <dig> nit2-binding sites and shown transcription modulation of the pbgp <dig> with primary nitrogen sources; however the participation of a nit <dig> transcription factor binding to the putative motifs at - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> was unlikely  <cit> . the core sequence of cdxa-binding element is a/ta/tta/ta/cta/g  <cit> , thus allowing for several sequence possibilities. that probably explains why cdxa is one of the most frequently found promoter elements in human genes  <cit> . transcription factor cdxa is a homeodomain protein originally described in the early stages of morphogenesis of chicken intestinal tract  <cit> , but its role on regulation of fungal genes has apparently not been addressed. the p. brasiliensis genome does not show any protein with high identities with cdxa, although other homeobox proteins have been annotated. on the other hand, there is a slight similarity of p. brasiliensis proteins with sox- <dig>  whose dna-binding motif is seen in non-overlapping fragments of the probes covering sequence form - <dig> and - <dig> 

to date, we have not been able to purify and identify the dna-binding proteins detected here. the probes tested are located close to pbgp <dig> transcription start sites and we understand from our previous work that the first - <dig> bp were sufficient to promote basal levels of gene transcription and also modulation with ammonium sulfate  <cit> . this fragment contains most of 1a region. when we blasted the overlap -125/- <dig>  and -243/- <dig>  oligonucleotides from emsa-positive fragments with p. brasiliensis upstream intergenic regions http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/multihome.html, exact matches were found generally at the 11-mer level in about  <dig> to  <dig> genes. sequence ctgttgatctttt has been found in p. brasiliensis homologous genes encoding beta-hexosaminidase and chitin synthase, but mostly in genes encoding predicted or hypothetical proteins. concerning the mutated -125/- <dig> region, we detected identical fragments in the upstream region of one gene encoding beta-glucosidase. therefore, although gp <dig> is a non-functional β- <dig> -exoglucanase, its gene may have conserved transcription motifs characteristic of those related to carbohydrate metabolism, possibly within the binding sequences identified here. we presently showed negative modulation with glucose of pbgp <dig> from pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> at similar rates, but the participation of the binding dna sequences revealed here in this or other modulations is presently unknown and will have to be addressed using gene reporter experiments.

basal levels of pbgp <dig> transcripts varied considerably among isolates  corroborating differences observed at extracellular protein levels  <cit> . by comparing length polymorphism of pbgp <dig> upstream sequences we observed some correlation with p. brasiliensis phylogenetic group ps <dig> isolates, since dna from pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> yielded a similarly shorter amplicon of about  <dig>  bp. however amplicon from pb <dig>  was also about this size. p. brasiliensis isolates representative of s <dig> group and pbgp <dig> genotypes c, d, and e  <cit>  resulted in amplification of a  <dig>  bp-fragment, but exceptions of longer fragments were observed in pb <dig> and pb <dig> . it is possible that these isolates bear a forth repetitive region. we noticed that although the accumulated pbgp <dig> transcripts in pb <dig> can be as high as about  <dig> -fold that of pb <dig> , this difference can not be justified by missing sequences within - <dig>  to - <dig>  in addition, even though there is one region missing in pb <dig>  accumulated pbgp <dig> transcripts were only 129-fold less abundant than in pb <dig>  therefore, the relevance of repetitive regions will be better investigated at the level of polymorphisms to explain transcription differences; however the influence of mrna stability and 3' regulators should not be disregarded. additionally, differences at the level of rna processing should be better investigated. several studies point to intraspecies divergence in gene expression related to mutations in cis-regulatory elements, such as in cyp6g  <dig>  from drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . changes in cis-regulatory systems of genes more often underlie the evolution of morphological diversity than do changes in gene number or protein function  <cit> . cis-regulatory sequences are more susceptible to mutations; therefore long intergenic regions should accumulate them during evolution. it was surprising, however, to find highly conserved sequences among isolates upstream of the repetitive regions in the 5' intergenic region of pbgp <dig> 

we believe that the quite special arrangements detected in the 5' intergenic region of pbgp <dig> are not at all incidental, however we can not precise their role at present. in addition, when we blasted the whole pb <dig> connector sequence  against other dimorphic fungal sequences http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/dimorph_collab.1/multihome.html we realized that fragments of fifteen to thirteen bp or even longer  are conserved in the 5' upstream regions from other genes, although mostly from predicted or hypothetical proteins. this specific search resulted in, for e.g., six matches with sequences from pb <dig>  three from pb <dig>  thirty-three from pb <dig> and  <dig> from h. capsulatum. the sequence ttcaaggttttgatagttatag, including the blue and gray fragments  was detected in the uracil dna glycosidase superfamily from h. capsulatum h143; tatttgaggtattttcaa, including the brown and blue fragments  was seen upstream of the acid phosphatase gene in the same isolate and part of it  was also found upstream of a reduced viability upon starvation protein in pb <dig>  another fragment containing the red and pink sequences   is upstream of the map kinase gene in h. capsulatum h <dig> 

isolate pb <dig> probably belongs to a different paracoccidioides species whose proposed name is p. lutzii  <cit> . in this isolate, the gene homologue to pbgp <dig> shows extensive polymorphism in the orf, bearing only 80% identity with gp <dig> from pb <dig>  the predicted protein  does not have any n-glycosylation site, mutated nep, or conserved p <dig>  therefore it is a potentially active glucanase. the 5' intergenic region is reduced to about  <dig> bp, when the first exon from a gene homologous to that encoding succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase starts. in this fragment, we could observe one region that aligns with 1a, 1b and 1c regions, however with many divergences and two long gaps. therefore, the transcripts are probably regulated differently, but there are no experimental data available to confirm that.

protein binding probes were positive in emsa carried out with total protein extracts from pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb3; however emsa bands migrated generally faster with pb <dig> extracts and that could be related to the genetic differences found in isolates belonging to ps <dig>  interestingly, we observed that probes containing an ap- <dig> recognition sequence or heat shock elements within the shared 5' intergenic region between pblon and pbmdj <dig> formed emsa bands that migrated consistently faster with protein extracts from pb <dig>  <cit> . by comparing pb <dig> and pb <dig> ap- <dig> and hsf genome sequences, however, we observed that they are quite conserved; therefore polymorphism could not explain migration differences, which might be due to post-translational modifications in the translation factors or even binding to distinct proteins in different isolates.

one of the processing steps of pre-messenger rna before export to the cytoplasm for translation involves endonucleolytic 3' cleavage for definition of the utr and addition of the poly tail. in higher eukaryotes, the choice of poly sites involves, among others, a poly signal  hexamer aauaaa , localized  <dig> to  <dig> nt upstream of the poly site, and u-rich region  that lays  <dig> to  <dig> nt downstream of the poly site  <cit> . the pas hexamer binds to a poly specific factor, while dse bears binding sites to a cleavage stimulating factor that directs polyadenylation. in our studies we found multiple poly cleavage sites between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the pbgp <dig> 3' utr. there is an aagaaa sequence  <dig> nt upstream of position  <dig> , which is a potential pas, or positioning element as defined in yeast  <cit> . according to a survey on pas hexamers in  <dig>  human and  <dig>  mouse genes  <cit> , aagaaa was the fifth most frequent pas hexamer found, at a frequency of  <dig> % in humans and  <dig> % in mice. in the same study, the authors observed that heterogeneity of poly cleavage sites occurred most frequently within a range of  <dig> bp. therefore, they have defined poly sites up to 24-bp long. they also noticed that the occurrence of multiple potentially alternative poly sites in 54% of human genes. we analyzed  <dig> 3' utr sequences from a single gene  in ten isolates of p. brasiliensis and observed that within a range of  <dig> bp there were two main clusters  of multiple cleavage sites separated by one to five bp . they are separated by ten bp and we could speculate that they constitute two alternative poly sites. only 21% of the sequences  had cleavage sites in the second cluster. it is worth mentioning that the sequence downstream of the 3'-most cleavage site is u/ug-rich, as in mammal dse, although this element has not been described in yeasts  <cit> . differences in the pas hexamer could result in diversity of cleavage sites. our analysis showed conserved 3' utr in the pbgp <dig>  therefore polymorphism in poly cleavage site has a different origin. in yeasts, the role of close but alternative poly site is unknown  <cit>  and in p. brasiliensis this subject has originally been studied here. comparison of  <dig> bp of pbgp <dig> 3' intergenic region from pb <dig>  with genome sequences http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/multihome.html shows substitutions in positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  for pb <dig> and pb <dig>  which have not been detected in the present work.

CONCLUSIONS
we have undertaken extensive studies on polymorphisms in the 5' and 3' intergenic regions of the pbgp <dig> gene from paracoccidioides brasiliensis. we have characterized  <dig>  bp of intergenic region and described a peculiar type of sequence structure with repetitive fragments. two promoter regions containing polymorphic nucleotides were able to bind protein. we have detected differences that might guide future efforts to understand transcriptional differences of pbgp <dig> among isolates.
