BACKGROUND
pathogen transmission by ticks is a worldwide problem that causes significant health risks and economical losses  <cit> . the deer tick, ixodes scapularis, which is prevalent in the eastern and upper mid-western united states, functions as a vector for a number of pathogens including the lyme disease spirochete, borrelia burgdorferi,  <cit>  that the u.s. centers for disease control estimates currently causes  <dig>  new infections each year solely in the united states  <cit> . to date, preventing tick-transmitted diseases relies mostly on the application of acaricides and protecting against tick bites  <cit> . currently, no vaccines are available for most tick-transmitted pathogens, emphasizing the health risks posed by tick-bites. pathogen transmission is substantially aided by bioactive components of tick saliva providing anti-inflammatory or anti-haemostatic effects amongst other activities . several studies have demonstrated the importance of specific tick salivary proteins in pathogen transmission  <cit> ; pathogen transmission from tick vectors is significantly more efficient compared to pathogen transmission through a needle and syringe, underlining the importance of tick saliva in this process  <cit> .

it is noteworthy that the transcriptome of tick salivary glands is highly dynamic and changes rapidly during feeding  <cit> . even more interesting is the observation that early salivary proteins, those expressed within the first 24 hours of feeding, appear to be sufficient to induce an immune response in certain hosts  <cit>  while during this early phase of blood feeding, few if any pathogens are transferred from tick to host  <cit> .

certain host animals can acquire immunity to tick bites after repeated infestations . acquired tick resistance  and the tick protective response can manifest itself in many different ways. among the valid definitions listed in the literature are decreased numbers of ticks successfully engorging on a host, premature tick detachment, decreased oviposition or even death of the tick as well as host hypersensitivity reactions  <cit> . a study focusing on basophils and mast cells as well as different ig receptors on their surface showed that these cell types as well as immunoglobulins of the igg and the ige class are essential for acquired tick immunity  <cit> . furthermore, acquired tick immunity also has been correlated with impaired pathogen transmission  <cit> , inspiring the concept of anti-tick vaccination. such a strategy could potentially alleviate human health risks by preventing infection with a number of pathogens through a single, vector-targeted approach to vaccination. several studies have begun assessing this idea, using serum antibodies from tick sensitized animals as probes for identifying immunogenic proteins in tick saliva, followed by testing the vaccination potential of the identified antigens in immunization studies  <cit> . however, to our knowledge there is no study identifying tick salivary antigens as potential vaccine candidates that are recognized specifically by humans.

phage display is a robust technique suited for high-throughput screening of specific and high-affinity interactions between biomolecules, especially proteins and peptides such as antibodies and/or antigens . phage particles can directly be engineered to display foreign proteins on their surface while carrying the genetic information inside their capsid, thus providing an intrinsic connection of genotype and phenotype  <cit> . phage display libraries are readily generated from genomic dna of prokaryotes and cdna of eukaryotes. a major burden during library construction is the high rate of dna fragments cloned out of frame with the phage coat protein to be fused to for display  <cit> . this pitfall is significantly relieved by the phorf/hyperphage system, which includes an orf enrichment step, improving the efficiency of library packaging and subsequent screening . an overview about m <dig> phage display derived technologies for selecting immunogenic proteins/biomarkers is given elsewhere  <cit> .

in this study a phage display antigen library composed of cdna derived from 18 h fed nymphal i. scapularis salivary gland mrna was generated. the goal was to screen this library against igg antibodies from human donors that self-identified as having strong reactions to tick bites, including redness and itching, pre-mature tick detachment or even death of the tick. proteins identified in this screen are proposed to be useful in at least two ways. first, these proteins might serve as future vaccine candidates to immunize against tick bites and in this way to prevent tick transmitted diseases. second, the presence of antibodies against these identified proteins may be useful as biomarkers of tick exposure or recent tick bites.

RESULTS
construction of an antigen library from salivary glands of i. scapularis nymphs
in order to construct an antigen library containing proteins which are relevant in anti-tick immunity  <cit> , the salivary glands of nymphal i. scapularis previously fed for 18 h on a rodent host were dissected and mrna was extracted. this mrna was reverse transcribed into double-stranded cdna using the smart cdna synthesis kit. in this protocol a pcr based amplification step is performed to obtain larger quantities of double-stranded cdna of full-length transcripts from limited mrna sources. the salivary gland derived cdna obtained by this protocol revealed a size range from 100 bp to more than 2000 bp . subsequently, this cdna was used to construct a phage display antigen library using the phorf3/hyperphage system  <cit> . since utrs at the 5’ and the 3’ ends as well as stop codons are not desired for subsequent cloning into the phagemid vector phorf <dig>  a partial restriction enzyme digest using three blunt end cutters was performed . finally, cdna fragments were ligated into phorf <dig> and e. coli top10f’ were transformed with this library. a colony-pcr was performed to assess the range of insert sizes as well as the cloning efficiency. more than  <dig> % of the analyzed clones contained an insert ranging from 50 bp to 700 bp .  <dig> clones were subsequently sequenced, verifying that inserts are containing tick salivary sequences . finally, the library diversity was determined to be  <dig> x  <dig> independent clones as assessed by transformation efficiency.fig  <dig>

packaging of the library was performed using a helperphage lacking a functional gene encoding the piii envelope protein called hyperphage  <cit> . together with the phorf <dig> phagemid, this system allows for orf enrichment as only inserts which are in-frame with the piii gene of the phagemid will be expressed as oligopeptide-piii fusions and thus assemble infectious phage  <cit> . this library was packaged yielding a final phage titer of  <dig> x 1011 cfu/ml, ensuring sufficient coverage for each of the predicted  <dig> antigens of the library.

analysis of human blood sera for sgh reactivity
for this study several human blood sera were obtained from donors who classified themselves as either tick-bite sensitive or tick-bite naive, the latter meaning that these individuals had never been bitten by a tick, according to their own statement. in contrast, tick-bite sensitive donors had been bitten multiple times and some reported strong and instant responses such as itching or rashes, which might also be triggered through humoral immunity .table  <dig> tick-bite status of the eight human blood donors used in this study. donors were categorized according to their own statements to be either tick-bite naive  or tick-bite sensitized 



an elisa was performed to analyze these blood sera for titers of antibodies recognizing tick salivary proteins. salivary gland homogenate  of i. scapularis nymphs, fed for 18 h on a rodent host, was immobilized in the wells of a microtiter plate. next, dilution series of human donor sera were tested for igg antibodies recognizing the sgh. as a negative control the same sera dilution series were tested on blocked wells without sgh . note that even donors who classified themselves as tick-bite naive  revealed some potential to recognize tick salivary proteins. on the contrary, some donors classified as tick-bite sensitive performed poorly in this assay . according to this assay, donors  <dig> and  <dig> showed very promising results with respect to the presence of sgh specific immunoglobulins .fig  <dig> elisa analysis to test the reactivity of serum igg from eight different donors  to tick salivary gland homogenate . sgh was immobilized in the wells of a microtiter plate and screened with a dilution series for each serum . controls were performed with the same dilution series on blocked wells without sgh to determine unspecific background signals 



enrichment of anti-sgh specific antibodies from human blood sera
due to the complex nature of human blood sera, specific antibodies recognizing tick salivary proteins were purified from promising sera, as judged by the first elisa analysis . this step was performed to increase the specificity and thus the significance of the screening of the phage display library  using highly concentrated and specific anti-sgh antibodies from tick-bite sensitive donors.

for this purpose 18 h nymphal tick sgh was coupled to magnetic carboxy beads. these beads were used in a pull-down experiment with the sera of donors  <dig>  and  <dig>  which were judged as high performers according to fig  <dig>  after incubation with the sera, the beads were washed, and bound antibodies were eluted. the eluate was quantified and analyzed by elisa for increased binding efficiency to sgh, compared to the original serum as well as a negative control eluate obtained from using blocked beads without sgh for the pull-down . the experiment confirmed the presence of highly specific igg antibodies in the sera of donors  <dig> and  <dig> recognizing tick salivary proteins. based on the confirmation of the presence of these antibodies, whole serum samples as well as enriched anti-sgh specific antibodies were used to screen our nymphal salivary gland library using phage display to identify proteins specifically recognized by these antibodies.fig  <dig> representative experiment for enrichment of sgh specific antibodies from serum of donor  <dig>  sgh-coupled carboxy beads were incubated with serum, washed and specifically binding antibodies were eluted. the eluted antibodies were quantified and tested for their reactivity to sgh in an elisa . serum was also incubated with control beads without coupled sgh and eluted antibodies were tested for reactivity with sgh in an elisa . additionally, antibodies from whole serum without enrichment were tested 



phage display screening for immunogenic nymphal tick salivary gland peptides
immunogenic peptides from 18 h fed nymphal i. scapularis were identified by screening the phage antigen library against immunoglobulins of the igg isotypes from human blood sera using the phorf <dig> system  <cit> . here, two different strategies were utilized. first, igg from whole sera were captured and screened against the antigen library in three consecutive panning rounds. second, the same procedure was followed using the anti-sgh specific antibodies previously enriched using the pull-down strategy instead of the whole sera.

after three consecutive rounds of panning, a screening elisa was performed using the resulting enriched phage clones to confirm the presentation of specifically recognized salivary peptides. here,  <dig> clones were picked and monoclonal phages were produced in microtiter plates. these phage particles were immobilized in the wells of a microtiter plate and analyzed for their reactivity with igg from the whole donor sera or enriched anti-sgh specific antibodies, respectively . as a negative control hyperphage was immobilized and screened accordingly . enriched peptides identified in this assay are summarized in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  of note, these peptides are the result solely from screenings performed with sera from donors  <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, screenings performed with sera from donors previously classified as tick-bite naive did not lead to the enrichment of any of the clones given in table  <dig> .fig  <dig> result of a screening elisa after three rounds of panning with sgh specific antibodies from donor  <dig>  monoclonal antigen-displaying phage were immobilized in the wells of a microtiter plate and screened for reactivity with the enriched serum antibodies. letter-number combinations on the x-axis represent the wells of the plate. red bar represents immobilized hyperphage, not displaying any peptide, as the negative control. green bars represent detection of m <dig> phage as a positive control for phage immobilization



validating the immunogenic character of the identified salivary proteins
among the proteins identified , four were selected for recombinant production in e. coli blr and subsequent validation of the immunogenic character in a titration elisa assay with all donor sera. the proteins selected are ixodes scapularis conserved hypothetical protein  because it had the most significant enrichment throughout all screens, the thrombin inhibitor  due to its potential role in interfering with host blood coagulation, the ubiquitin protein ligase  since two molecules of this type were selected, and the metalloprotease  since this protease has been discussed in the context of tick immunity previously  <cit> .

subsequent cloning of the i. scapularis conserved hypothetical protein proved not possible. however, cloning of his-tagged versions of the other three proteins was successful, followed by their production in e. coli blr and subsequent purification .fig  <dig> western blot analysis of recombinantly expressed tick salivary proteins metalloprotease  <dig> a, ubiquitin ligase b and thrombin inhibitor c. all three proteins were expressed as his-tag fusion proteins and detected with an anti-his-tag antibody. abbreviations represent the following: cl crude lysate, sn supernatant after binding to ni-sepharose, 1 w first wash fraction, 2 w second wash fraction, 3 w third wash fraction, pbsw pbs wash fraction, 1e first eluted fraction, 2e second eluted fraction, 3e third eluted fraction



titration elisa assays with dilutions of sera from all donors were performed for each of the purified proteins. while the thrombin inhibitor as well as the ubiquitin ligase did not reveal any specific reactivity to any donor serum as compared to a bsa negative control, the metalloprotease was clearly recognized by the sera from donors  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . furthermore, sera from all other donors did not show specific binding of igg antibodies compared to a bsa negative control . this finding strongly suggests the immunogenic character of the metalloprotease and clearly shows the presence of specific antibodies in the sera from three donors, two of which self-reported as tick-bite sensitized.fig  <dig> titration elisa to determine reactivity of igg from donor sera with i. scapularis metalloprotease . mp was recombinantly produced in e. coli blr, purified and immobilized in the wells of a microtiter plate. reactivity of sera from donors  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is depicted . as negative controls, sera were screened against blocked wells without recombinant mp 



discussion
due to their ability to transmit pathogens, ticks pose significant risks to humans and domestic animals resulting in public health concerns and significant economic losses  <cit> . current treatments to relieve tick burdens in endemic areas are mostly based on application of acaricides. this strategy, however, has negative impacts on the environment and agriculture, and raises concerns about the development of resistances  <cit> . development of a broad-spectrum tick protective vaccine represents a promising alternative. based on the phenomenon of acquired tick immunity  <cit> , vaccination with molecules present in tick saliva appears to be a most sound public health approach  <cit> . the goal of this study was to identify i. scapularis salivary antigens that could serve as novel tick protective vaccine candidates for humans. a phage display approach was adapted to identify these proteins. the screening was designed to identify i. scapularis salivary antigens recognized by antibodies present in human blood sera.

this study reports the first use of antibodies from human blood sera as probes for detecting immunogenic salivary proteins. in former studies antibodies from rabbits were successfully used  <cit> . however, studies attempting to identify salivary proteins recognized by the human immune system are lacking. the prospect of utilizing human samples comes with some disadvantages compared to animal sera derived from controlled experiments. first, the availability of tick-naive serum donors is critical since donors reporting as tick-bite naive might have been unknowingly exposed to ticks. in contrast, tick-bite sensitized donors provide highly relevant sera. importantly, the time interval since last tick exposure plays an essential role for the titers of specific antibodies in sera. this point likely explains the differences observed in igg binding to salivary gland homogenate between individual donors in this study. the limitation of low antibody titers was overcome by enrichment of specific anti-sgh antibodies.

after establishing the screening protocol using human sera, eight unique oligopeptide phage clones were selected, showing significant reactivity to whole sera as well as enriched anti-tick specific antibodies from three tick-bite sensitized donors.

among the proteins identified in this screening, the most promising candidate is metalloprotease  <dig> . mp <dig> has a theoretical molecular weight of 37 kda, a conserved zinc-binding domain as well as twelve highly conserved cysteine residues. apart from this protein being secreted into the extracellular space, mp <dig> has been described before as potentially immunogenic  <cit> . therefore, these results confirm the suggested immunogenic character of mp <dig>  furthermore, mp <dig> has been stated to have fibrinlytic activity as well as gelatinase activity  <cit> . ticks could be utilizing these biochemical activities to counteract haemostasis or act in destruction of host extracellular matrix . interestingly, it has been reported that borrelia burgdorferi upregulates host metalloproteases in order to damage host ecm and facilitate infection  <cit> . this finding suggests a direct impact of tick feeding on pathogen transmission through compromising host defense. the selected oligopeptide of mp <dig> is located directly at the beginning of the cysteine-rich region and just  <dig> amino acids away from the zinc-binding domain. accordingly, it is tempting to speculate that binding of an antibody to mp <dig> might have direct negative influence on the enzymatic function and/or enzyme-substrate interaction through steric hindrance.

if considering mp <dig> as a potential vaccine candidate, multi-species protection is of high interest  <cit> . interestingly, mp <dig> has very close homologs in other tick species such as i. pacificus and i. ricinus, the latter being the most prevalent tick vector of lyme borreliosis in europe. salivary gland metalloproteases identified in i. ricinus termed metis  have been described previously and were shown to have good vaccination capacity. furthermore, rnai-based knock-down of metis proteins in i. ricinus revealed increased tick mortality  <cit> . interestingly, sequence comparison of mp <dig> with metis <dig> reveals  <dig> % identity between the two proteins on amino acid level. despite having low homology to mp <dig> another vaccination study performed in rabbits using a metalloprotease from haemophysalis longicornis also revealed good vaccination efficiency  <cit> . these findings, combined with the high degree of homology between metis proteins and mp <dig>  strongly favor mp <dig> as a putatively effective, multi-species vaccine candidate.

besides metalloprotease mp <dig>  the phage display strategy identified a putative thrombin inhibitor as another immunogenic tick salivary component. unfortunately, the immunogenic character of this protein could not be confirmed via recombinant expression and elisa. this shortcoming was potentially due to limitations in the bacterial expression system, including incomplete/improper folding or absence of post-translational modifications in the expressed protein. however, it is reasonable to speculate that a thrombin inhibitor provides a major benefit in tick feeding. accordingly, counteracting the thrombin inhibitor through antibodies would be a sensible host response to tick feeding. based on sequence similarity, the identified protein can be placed in the serpin family of protease inhibitors, suggesting its ability to interfere with the blood clotting cascade and other protease cascades involved in inflammation such as complement activation or catabolism of phagocytosed proteins. interestingly, a recent publication identifies a thrombin inhibitor from i. scapularis, which is reported to inhibit not only thrombin but also factor xa and cathepsin g, revealing activities against haemostasis and inflammatory responses  <cit> . this report bolsters significance and credibility to the thrombin inhibitor identified in this screen as a potential vaccine target.

excluding the metalloprotease and the thrombin inhibitor mentioned previously, all other binders identified in this work are intracellular proteins. while it may seem counterintuitive to envision intracellular proteins as potential vaccine candidates, just such a tick ribosomal protein has recently been suggested  <cit> . the well documented, dynamic nature of salivary gland protein expression during feeding  <cit>  necessitates a synchronization between cell proliferation and cell death; dying cells can leak intracellular components into the surrounding fluids, thus enabling host contact and initiation of the adaptive immune response. antibodies binding these displaced intracellular proteins may form immune complexes at the tick-bite site and help recruit other cells of the immune system such as neutrophils or macrophages  <cit> , thereby providing a mechanism for inducing inflammation at a site that is otherwise strongly immune-suppressed through the activities of many other of the tick salivary proteins. of note, a recent study using a t <dig> phage display based approach to identify the tick saliva immune-proteome reports a broad range of proteins, secreted and intracellular, to be putatively immunogenic  <cit> .

the discovery of metalloprotease  <dig> appears highly promising due to its published recognition as an immunogenic antigen and the high efficiency of other tick metalloproteases in stimulating a vaccination response . all identified proteins in this study represent potentially important new tools in solving the tick problem; they may prove not only for their strong potential as anti-tick vaccine candidates but also for diagnostic purposes as biomarkers of vector tick exposure.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, mp <dig> of i. scapularis was identified as immunogenic protein. this protein was hypothesized as immunogenic in former publications. because mp <dig> is highly homologous in all ixodes species, this protein is an interesting biomarker and potential candidate for vaccine development.

materials and methods
