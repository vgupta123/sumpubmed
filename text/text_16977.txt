BACKGROUND
avocado  is an important agricultural crop in over  <dig> countries worldwide and is native to mexico and central america  <cit> . it belongs to the genus-persea, subgenus-persea, family-lauraceae and falls under the clade of magnoliids that are sister to eudicot and monodicot clades. p. americana is a diploid angiosperm consisting of  <dig> chromosomes with approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig>  base pairs . to date, the avocado genome is not yet available and only a limited number  of expressed sequence tags  generated from only fruit and flowers have been sequenced, annotated and released on the ncbi database.

phytophthora root rot , caused by phytophthora cinnamomi rands, is considered the most destructive pathogen-induced disease to the avocado industry  <cit>  with production relying heavily on the use of phosphite trunk injections and tolerant rootstocks such as dusa®  <cit>  supported by planting in high organic matter soils and mulching to promote antagonistic microbial growth against p. cinnamomi. metalaxyl has also showed promising results when used in conjunction with the tolerant rootstock duke  <dig> in california in the 1980s  <cit> . however in south africa it was reported that after successful application for a period of two years, metalaxyl application became inefficient in controlling the disease  <cit> . recently p. cinnamomi has shown a decrease in sensitivity to phosphite treatments after prolonged usage  <cit> . the authors demonstrated that p. cinnamomi isolates exposed to long periods of phosphite treatment in south west australia showed reduced sensitivity to the fungicide when evaluated on avocado, lupins and eucalyptus. the population of p. cinnamomi isolated from phosphite treated sites colonized phosphite treated plant material easier than isolates not previously exposed to the fungicide. this decreased sensitivity to phosphite could indicate the onset of resistance to the fungicide.

as early as  <dig> avocado researchers identified that the success of the avocado industry lay in rootstock improvement  <cit> . the world's largest rootstock germplasm is maintained in california since  <dig>  with the hope of identifying more tolerant rootstocks for cultivation  <cit> . to date a small number of rootstocks have been identified with partial resistance to p. cinnamomi such as thomas, martin grande, barr duke, duke  <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> . in south africa, the devastation caused by p. cinnamomi in the 1970s prompted the importation of clonal rootstocks and the development of a large scale selection program in the 1980s. for many years duke  <dig> remained the industry standard in south africa, until  <dig> with the release of the dusa® rootstock by westfalia technological services. dusa® gave avocado farmers a better alternative to duke  <dig> that showed improved tolerance to p. cinnamomi as well as good fruit yields. the avocado breeding program at westfalia is a continuing process and uses previously identified tolerant rootstocks as parents to undergo open pollination. recently, field trials were conducted on a selection of rootstocks in queensland, australia with some selections such as 'shsr-02', 'shsr-04', un-grafted 'hass' and dusa® demonstrating their tolerance to prr  <cit> .

despite the importance of avocado and a  <dig> year attempt to unravel the host pathogen interaction, our knowledge is based on; the analysis of root exudates <cit> , chemical analysis of roots  <cit> , the application of chemicals to aid in suppression of the pathogen  <cit> , and biochemical studies  <cit> . histological studies on roots infected with p. cinnamomi have aimed to try and understand the plant pathogen interaction  <cit> . it was observed that necrophylactic periderm and periclinal cell wall division occurred, which limited the pathogens progress but did not affect the viability of the pathogen or reduce its ability to infect the host plant. p. cinnamomi infect the plants roots via motile zoospores present in the soil. the attraction of zoospores was investigated by botha and kotze in  <dig> and it was found to be influenced by the composition of  <dig> amino acids in avocado root exudates  <cit> . sánchez-pérez and colleagues tested crude root exudates for p. cinnamomi mycelial inhibition and subsequently the compound known as stigmastan- <dig>  5-diene was identified as the inhibitory compound  <cit> . garcía-pineda et al.  investigated reactive oxygen species  formation and the role of nitric oxide  against p. cinnamomi  <cit> . the authors observed an increase in ros and no levels and deduced that the increase in ros observed may assist in weakening host tissue early in infection with the sharp increase in no possibly resulting in salicylic acid  accumulation. this accumulation could cause an sa mediated h2o <dig> burst by the suppression of h2o <dig> degradation. the authors hypothesize that  cat is bound by sa, which inhibits cats h2o <dig> degrading activity. the effect of externally applied sa on root colonisation was also investigated and indicated that decreased root colonisation was associated with sa application. sa has been implicated in regulating cell death, inducing resistance responses and activating various defence genes such as pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit>  but the mode of action has not been elucidated. the production of no and ros have previously been demonstrated to activate cell death. these early attempts on investigating the interaction between avocado and p. cinnamomi have illustrated the complexity of the defence response, highlighting the need for the molecular elucidation of defence genes.

molecular research on avocado has comprised of genetic relationship studies and the molecular characterization of the fruit and flowers. there has been some gene characterization of avocado fruit ripening genes  <cit> . the greater part of molecular detail exists due to a continuous effort in marker development to assist in either elucidating genetic relationships amongst scions  <cit> , or scion improvement  <cit> . there is currently a preliminary genetic map available based on microsatellites, random amplified polymorphic dna  markers and dna fingerprint  markers  <cit> . the most recent molecular development in the fight against prr was the identification of  <dig> microsatellite markers that were developed from over  <dig> ests in the hope of aiding in marker assisted breeding against prr. the ests were however from a floral gene database generated for comparative genomics research of basal angiosperms. their efficacy has yet to be tested for use in identifying tolerant rootstocks, but it is known that they amplify across all avocado varieties and can be used for investigation of genetic relations  <cit> . the university of california riverside  has recently employed  <dig> polymorphic aflp markers to characterise prr tolerance in  <dig> rootstocks from various locations including south africa and israel with the majority of rootstocks from the ucr collection  <cit> . the study concluded that resistance mechanisms vary between tolerant cultivars and no trend was observed in the cluster analysis.

the avocado/p. cinnamomi interaction has not previously been elucidated on a molecular level. current knowledge is based on research of the non-host plant, arabidopsis. a study conducted on arabidopsis infected with p. cinnamomi revealed that ros induction, hr activation, lignin synthesis and callose production was initiated upon infection. the non-host showed activation of the ethylene and jasmonic acid pathways and only a minor involvement of the sa pathway  <cit>  in contrast to the study conducted by garcía-pineda et al  on avocado which indicated that sa is a major inhibitor of pathogen colonisation. macroscopic changes such as callose production have also been observed during p. cinnamomi infection in maize  <cit>  and although model plants like arabidopsis provide an insight to defence responses there are differences between non-host and host-specific defence responses. in order to fully understand tolerance in avocado it is important to conduct molecular level studies on the host specific interaction between p. americana and p. cinnamomi.

since there is no genome data available for avocado, the identification and characterisation of genes is difficult. est generation supplements the lack of genome data by providing transcript specific information and excluding non-coding regions of the genome. high-throughput sequencing is well suited for large scale est discovery, providing a tool for gene discovery in non-model crops to evaluate the changes in gene expression to abiotic or biotic stresses  <cit> . the cost of pyrosequencing is also lower than conventional est sequencing, small transcripts are not lost, and the time in sequence generation from tissue isolation is greatly shortened  <cit> . more specifically, it is advantageous for commercial crops that lack substantial molecular databases and will aid in their unconventional improvement  <cit> . avocado is one such commercial crop that is in need of development of molecular tools for the improvement of the crop. avocados' importance as an agricultural crop has justified molecular investigation and the application of modern molecular tools for its improvement  <cit> . the application of high-throughput sequencing to avocado is the next step in improving breeding of this economically important crop.

in this study ests of a tolerant avocado rootstock infected with phytophthora cinnamomi were generated. the  <dig> gs-flx platform was used to generate sequence data for several time points including the uninfected,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after infection, as well as to identify transcripts that were associated with the defence response. we identified  <dig> transcripts from avocado and studied the gene expression of a selection of these ests, thereby providing the first molecular data for the avocado/p. cinnamomi interaction.

RESULTS
 <dig> pyrosequencing and assembly
three cdna libraries-uninfected , library  <dig>  and library  <dig>  were sequenced on a single lane on the gs flx platform and generated a total of  <dig> mb of data  consisting of  <dig> reads and resulted in the assembly of  <dig> contigs . these contigs comprised of  <dig> reads from the uninfected library,  <dig> reads from infection library  <dig> and  <dig> reads from infection library  <dig>  the average read lengths for the libraries were  <dig>  bp for uninfected,  <dig>  bp for library  <dig> and  <dig>  bp for the library  <dig> . the pyrosequencing run was efficient based on the maximal amount of data obtainable being  <dig>  mb with a maximal read length of  <dig> bp.

the total number of reads and contigs are shown to illustrate the efficiency of the pyrosequencing run.

est identification and classifications
after analysis using the dcas software,  <dig> novel ests were identified for p. americana. the program used blastx amino acid comparisons to screen for homology of the contigs against the ncbi non-redundant  database. a large proportion of the sequences generated showed homology to hypothetical proteins and  <dig> of the  <dig> contigs had no similarity to previously annotated sequences . of the  <dig> contigs identified, only two sequences showed homology to previously identified fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and metallothionein type-ii proteins from avocado, with the remaining  <dig> not having any avocado sequence homolog in the nr database. manual blast annotation did not influence transcript identification.

contigs were classed as unidentified, identified or hypothetically identified if the sequence homology search revealed that there was no similarity, significant similarity or inferred structural function respectively. the total number of genes identified was  <dig> with only  <dig> of the total  <dig> contigs generating no identification using the non-redundant  database on the ncbi.

contigs were grouped into functional classes according to the go  and kog  databases. nine percent of contigs were grouped into the unknown functional class in the kog database while  <dig> % of contigs from the go classification were represented by unknown functions . the categories of post-translational modification; translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; signal transduction mechanisms and general function prediction contained a combined total of  <dig> % of all contigs. according to the go database the functional classifications of cell wall related; protein binding; stress response; ribosomal structural constituent; cytoplasmic biological processes; cellular component and other categories comprised  <dig> % of all contigs with 3%  of the contigs linking directly with stress responses. over  <dig> putative defence related genes were identified ranging from general defence-related genes  to more specific oomycete defence-related genes  .

a large proportion of contigs  fell into the category of unknown classification while contigs that link directly with stress responses constituted 3% of the total number of contigs.

six genes were isolated from library  <dig> cdna while  <dig> genes were identified from the library  <dig> cdna. these transcripts play a role in either biotic or abiotic stress responses showing the species to which the sequence showed homology.

certain transcripts could be related directly to oomycete infection in other plants. strong e-values indicate confidence in the identification of these defence-related genes.

species similarity between avocado and other plants
we observed significant sequence homology between vitis vinifera  and avocado when the species origin of the sequence similarity was investigated. the top three represented species according to amino acid homology on the ncbi were v. vinifera, arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa, with v. vinifera having the majority of the hits in all three libraries. twenty two percent of sequences showed homology to v. vinifera sequences with  <dig> % belonging to a. thaliana and  <dig> % of sequences to o. sativa. homology to p. americana was found in only 1% of sequences  . only two genes were represented by the 1% in which the metallothionein transcript featured three times and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase featured once. grape vine featured among the top ten homologous hits of every contig that was annotated. thirty seven percent of the annotated contigs were represented by various plant species such as prunus armeniaca, solanum tuberosum, hevea brasiliensis with the variety of plant species not biased to any particular family or order. the majority of the species similarities relate to a large variety of plants that have been collectively categorised as other.

quantitative gene expression analysis
expression analyses of nine genes were conducted at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post infection  to validate if the pyrosequencing data reflected their gene expression. this was normalized against 18s and actin reference genes to give the relative gene expression. the expression data was then compared against the pyrosequencing data which revealed that six of the nine genes showed similarities between the two methods, showing the highest expression at a time point belonging to the library from which the transcript emanated .

all the genes chosen for expression profiling from the tolerant avocado rootstock infected with phytophthora cinnamomi showed the highest expression from a time point related to the cdna library of their identification except the pathogenesis-related protein, profilin-like protein and the universal stress protein.

thaumatin expression was significantly greater at  <dig> hpi  as oppose to the uninfected , as well as the  <dig> &  <dig> hpi . the expression pattern indicated that thaumatin was only regulated in response to p. cinnamomi by  <dig> hpi and increased by nearly threefold over a  <dig> hour period. thaumatin levels were significantly higher in the later infection time points when compared to the earlier time points-thus correlating with the pyrosequencing data.

the pathogenesis-related  psemi gene showed significant increases in expression at  <dig> &  <dig> hpi. at  <dig> hpi psemi reached the highest expression level of  <dig>  when compared to all time points . by  <dig> hpi psemi expression had decreased significantly to  <dig> , reaching levels comparable to  <dig> hpi.

cytochrome p450-like tbp  showed a significant early response at  <dig> hr after infection with p. cinnamomi reacting with an increase of ten-fold. at  <dig> hpi the gene was significantly down-regulated followed by a substantial increase at  <dig> hpi- a similar level found at  <dig> hpi. the gene was then significantly down-regulated to  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi and remained unchanged at  <dig> hpi . cytochrome p450-like tbp levels were constantly up- and down-regulated showing significant variation over time points. the data was consistent with the pyrosequencing data for this transcript.

the gene encoding for a metallothionein-like protein was constitutively expressed at  <dig>  and showed no significant changes in expression over the first  <dig> hpi. this was however followed by a significant increase in the expression at  <dig> hpi when compared to all other time points reaching levels of  <dig> , the expression then decreased to  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi and remained unchanged at  <dig> hpi . the data showed similarity to the pyrosequencing data for this transcript.

the profilin-like gene was expressed constitutively at  <dig>  prior to infection. three hours after infection the transcript was significantly down-regulated to  <dig>   and remained unchanged at  <dig> hpi. there was a significant up-regulation from  <dig> hpi to <dig> hpi with expression peaking at  <dig> , followed by a significant decrease to  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi and remained unchanged at  <dig> hpi as opposed to  <dig> hpi .

the mlo transmembrane protein encoding gene was constitutively expressed at  <dig>  followed by a significant reduction at  <dig> hpi compared to the uninfected time point. at  <dig> hpi the tolerant rootstock responded with a significant increase to  <dig> . expression at  <dig> hpi was significantly down-regulated when compared to  <dig> hpi and reached a level of  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi . the mlo expression data was in agreement with the pyrosequencing data for this transcript.

the universal stress protein showed the maximum expression at  <dig> hpi but did not show a significant increase when compared to  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. an overall increase in expression was viewed until  <dig> hpi, followed by a significant down-regulation to  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi compared to  <dig> hpi .

two genes encoding respectively for the thaumatin-like protein and the leucine rich repeat  resistance protein-like protein were constitutively expressed at  <dig> . both genes showed no statistically significant change in regulation over the  <dig> hour time course, however similar to the majority of genes in this experiment, both genes showed the highest increase in expression at  <dig> hpi. the highest level of up-regulation achieved was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively .

discussion
we have sequenced the first set of avocado root transcriptomic data for the avocado-p. cinnamomi interaction. a single lane of pyrosequencing on the gs flx platform generated  <dig>  mb  of data, consisting of  <dig> reads that assembled into  <dig> contigs of which  <dig> ests are novel for p. americana and have not previously been identified. in addition, we were also able to identify and quantify the expression of nine defence-related genes that were regulated in response to p. cinnamomi. the primary objective of this study was to generate est data of a tolerant avocado rootstock infected with the root pathogen p. cinnamomi. this data identified the genes involved in cellular processes and defence mechanisms thereby providing the first platform for studying molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance in the roots of one of the important agricultural hosts of p. cinnamomi.

the  <dig> contigs were grouped into  <dig> and  <dig> functional classes based on the kog and go databases respectively using the dcas program. as expected, the majority of sequences had unknown functions. due to the high sensitivity of sequencing, transcriptome studies identify many transcripts that have not yet been characterised and many that have unknown functions even when annotated using a database such as gene ontology  <cit> . the lack of est and genome sequence data for avocado in general, specifically rootstocks, also accounts for the high frequency of unknown functions. the top ten functional groupings according to the go classification revealed that  <dig> % of assembled contigs were represented by unknown functions followed by the functional groups of 'other', 'cellular components', 'biological processes', 'stress responses', 'ribosome structure', 'cell wall related', 'protein binding', 'mitochondrion and 'atp-binding'. according to the kog database much of sequence data matched categories of 'general function prediction', which means that these transcripts show homology to transcripts that are poorly characterised according to the ncbi. the kog database revealed that the top ten classes that the contigs grouped into were firstly; 'general function prediction' followed by 'signal transduction', 'unknown function', 'translation and ribosomal structure', 'chaperones', 'carbohydrate metabolism', 'intracellular trafficking', 'transcription', 'cytoskeleton' and 'inorganic ion transport and metabolism'. furthermore, the presence of unidentified reads in this study is not unique to avocado, other studies have also produced sequence that did not align to any sequence present in ncbi datasets  <cit> .

we investigated the sequence homology between the avocado sequence data and the plant species that our data showed homology to. only 1%  of the sequenced contigs showed homology to p. americana, while 20-30% of the contigs generated showed similarity to grapevine . the lack of similarities to any avocado sequence data observed in our study emphasizes the lack of genetic data on the ncbi. the knowledge we have gained by sequencing avocado rootstock ests may provide some insight into other magnoliids or phylogenetically related plants. the sequence and expression data generated in this study can form a basis for functional genomics of basal angiosperms - a group which has no other model  <cit> .

as expected we isolated a number of ests with homology to genes previously associated with defence responses in plants against pathogens and in some cases, against oomycetes. interesting defence ests included thaumatin, metallothionein, a pr <dig> pathogenesis-related protein, a mlo transmembrane protein and profilin. nine genes were quantified with qrt-pcr to elucidate the early gene response of a tolerant avocado rootstock infected with p. cinnamomi as well as to validate the pyrosequencing data.

thaumatin, a pr <dig> protein associated with the sa pathway  <cit> , was significantly upregulated at  <dig> h in response to p. cinnamomi infection. the gene showed no changes in regulation during the first  <dig> hours after inoculation with a mycelial suspension. at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi expression showed an insignificant but steady increase in response to the infection. pr <dig> is induced by biotic stress and further linked to increased pathogen resistance  <cit> . garcía-pineda et al  showed decreased root colonization in the arabidopsis-p. cinnamomi system linked to sa. the significant up-regulation of thaumatin in the p. cinammomi tolerant avocado rootstock indicates the importance of the sa pathway in the early inhibition of the hemibiotroph p. cinnamomi. hemibiotrophs have an initial biotrophic phase prior to becoming necrotrophs and pr <dig> gene activity in the sa-dependant pathway has been previosuly shown to be effective against biotrophs  <cit> .

psemi was highly expressed at  <dig> hpi in tolerant avocado roots infected with p. cinnamomi. the pr <dig> gene was identified in the response of douglas -fir infected with phellinus weirii  <cit> . the authors showed that very high concentrations of pin m iii  was responsible for resistance to the rust pathogen cronartium ribicola. this pr- <dig> gene has also been used as a marker in screening for p. weirii resistance in douglas-fir and could therefore be valuable in screening for prr tolerance in avocado.

the gene encoding for the cytochrome p450-like tbp was the only transcript to be significantly induced by p. cinnamomi as early as  <dig> hpi. this enzyme features in oxidative metabolism and the production of ros. this rapid response could be attributed to the universal nature of the protein in cell metabolism and growth. additionally it has been reported to be involved in biotic and abiotic environmental responses as well as in the hr response to infection  <cit> .

our data revealed a noticeable host response at  <dig> hpi with the up-regulation of four transcripts, the metallothionein-like gene, the universal stress protein, profilin &mlo. metallothioneins inhibit programmed cell death  and fumonisin b1-induced root death in tomato infected with agrobacterium rhizogenes through interference of the ros pathway. ros accumulation was significantly reduced under metallothionein over-expression, validating its function in ros scavenging  <cit> . the significant induction of metallothionein in the highly tolerant avocado rootstock at  <dig> hpi implies that this protein may play a role in conferring disease tolerance to p. cinnamomi by scavenging ros. ros generation is indicative of the activity of the hypersensitive response , which leads to cell death and is effective against biotrophic organisms  <cit> .

the up-regulation of the universal stress protein at  <dig> hpi indicates the plant's response to the stress of infection by p. cinnamomi. universal stress proteins are mediated by ethylene  <cit> , and our results may therefore implicate the involvement of the ethylene pathway in response to p. cinnamomi, a pathway that has shown activation in the arabidopsis/p. cinnamomi interaction  <cit> .

both profilin &mlo play a role in actin filament polarization  <cit>  and actin rearrangement has been observed in plant-fungus interactions with successful pathogen infection resulting in the suppression of the rearrangement  <cit> . profilin is known to localize to the site beneath the cell wall, that is penetrated by the oomycetous appresorium  <cit>  and either promotes or prevents actin polymerization in the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . cell wall thickening during fungal attack also involves the re-orientation of actin filaments as a defense response in order to prevent pathogen ingress  <cit> . the up-regulation of profilin in avocado roots suggests that profilin is being produced in response to p. cinnamomi penetration. mlo, a transmembrane protein, modulates actin cytoskeleton polarization in resistant barley in response to a biotrophic fungus- blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei  <cit> . successful defence against pathogens results in cell wall strengthening and is correlated with increased actin accumulation at sites of attempted penetration  <cit> .

the thaumatin-like gene expression showed no significant response to the oomycete infection. this might be explained by the fact that it is usually induced by viral, bacterial and fungal infection  <cit> , and is believed to destroy fungal cell walls using a variety of enzymatic activities  <cit> . the lrr  resistance protein-like gene also demonstrated no significant response to p. cinnamomi. although resistance related lrr proteins have been found to interact specifically with other phytophthora species,   <cit> , no such interaction has to our knowledge been described for p. cinnamomi and its hosts, specifically avocado. however, the identification of a lrr-like gene from p. cinnamomi infected tolerant avocado roots warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified an interesting set of genes regulated by the infection of the hemibiotroph p. cinnamomi by using  <dig> pyrosequencing. defence genes included general defence-related transcripts  and phytophthora specific response genes such as   <cit> .

we inoculated avocado roots with a mycelial suspension, based on the genetic response by the plant, we hypothesize that the plant response is delayed due to the slower infection rate of mycelia as opposed to zoospores that are able to germinate and encyst within  <dig> hr of release from sporangia. despite this delay five of the nine defence-related transcripts showed a significant early response to the pathogen between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. based on this first set of transcriptome data we hypothesize that the tolerance of the rootstock in this study is most likely polygenic and based on the early detection of p. cinnamomi followed by a response that included ros and cell-wall strengthening. ongoing research in our laboratory has generated a second set of transcriptome data and has included a variety of rootstocks with different levels of prr tolerance and susceptibility as well as additional time-points.

we have successfully produced the first molecular data for the avocado-phytophthora cinnamomi interaction and believe that this data will contribute to the understanding of host defence against this devastating pathogen thereby aiding in the selection of tolerant avocado rootstocks.
