BACKGROUND
the use of eeg biofeedback technology  to self-regulate brainwave frequencies with the aim of recovering or optimising function and performance is becoming increasingly established. its clinical applications include the treatment of epilepsy  <cit> , attention hyperactivity disorders  <cit>  and addiction  <cit> . meanwhile it has also assumed a role in optimising performance in healthy individuals within fields as diverse as cognition, sport and artistry  <cit> , including nasa research aimed at minimizing pilot error  <cit> . in particular, recent studies report significant improvements in attention  <cit> , memory  <cit> , mental rotation  <cit> , mood  <cit> , dance  <cit>  and musical performance  <cit> .

the set of skills required to undertake surgical and microsurgical procedures includes many of the cognitive and sensorimotor skills which neurofeedback has been shown to enhance. the demands on those undergoing surgical training are considerable and often stressful  <cit> . there may also exist time pressures on those seeking to acquire surgical skills and the availability of expert trainers is often at a premium. to this end there is investment in developing and evaluating procedures to enhance surgical training and performance such as simulation, video, virtual reality, motion tracking and mental training  <cit>  in this study, we examine the effect of two neurofeedback protocols on the acquisition of microsurgical skills by a group of trainee ophthalmic surgeons. specifically, fast wave training has been shown to facilitate sustained attention providing a relaxed attentional focus and increasing working memory  <cit> , of particular importance for surgery which requires agility, concentration and stamina for long periods of time  <cit> . the sensory motor rhythm neurofeedback protocol helps relax the motor system which is vital in complex sensory-motor performance  <cit> . on the other hand slow wave training may benefit both stamina and morale, for aside from relaxation, this protocol enhances mood and well-being, through putative action on the limbic emotion system  <cit>  ophthalmic surgery, by virtue of the scale at which surgery is undertaken and the extreme adverse consequence of error, provides an ideal model with which to evaluate the potential benefits of neurofeedback. in brief, surgical performance in a skills laboratory  <cit>  was assessed by means of two principal measures, surgical time and technique, representing the main critical dimensions in surgical proficiency: pace and accuracy  <cit> . our initial hypothesis was that neurofeedback training would be able to successfully modify these measures with the aim of enhancing individual surgical skills-scheduled within the context of standardized and ongoing medical training – by modulating general cerebral function  towards more 'efficacious' neural information processing appropriate to both the execution, as well as the retention, of fine sensorimotor maneuvers. in this regard surgeons were neither expected nor instructed to emulate or recollect 'neurofeedback conditions' on their own immediately prior to or during their performances, rather it was envisaged that the neuromodulatory effects of sustained control of the eeg would cumulate and be simultaneously active during the course of the multiple surgical training sessions as well as during the final performance.

the first protocol, known as smr-theta, aims to elevate the low beta "sensorimotor rhythm"   while concurrently suppressing theta activity , and has been shown to enhance perceptual sensitivity and attentional performance in healthy subjects  <cit>  resulting in decreased somatosensory and motor interference in basal ganglia/thalamocortical circuits  <cit> . this most likely occurs through the reinforcement of gabaergic inhibitory oscillations, such as those implicated in sensorimotor gating  <cit> , the genesis of sleep spindles  <cit> , and in reduction of seizure thresholds  <cit> . on the other hand, latest research points to a possible relationship between the smr rhythm and long term potentiation , widely regarded as the main mechanism behind long term memory. for example, stimulating bursts of oscillations in this frequency range induced long-term modifications of excitatory neocortical synapses  <cit> . moreover, 7– <dig> hz spindling has also been proposed to 'open molecular gates of plasticity  <cit> , by activating ca2+ currents prior to transition to stage  <dig> sleep. this role in facilitating sensorimotor control and memory has clear implications for microsurgical performance. the second protocol, commonly referred to as alpha-theta , aims to raise the ratio of theta  over alpha  activity levels during a wakeful eyes-closed condition in order to induce a deep relaxation state, given the association between theta activity and meditative states  <cit>  and the wakefulness-to-sleep transition  <cit> . it has been especially employed as a complementary therapy in post-traumatic stress disorder   <cit> , substance abuse  <cit> , and has been shown to increase wellbeing in socially withdrawn students  <cit> , as well as enhance artistry in music and dance performance  <cit> . its impact on motivation and mood is thought to be mediated through limbic activation and its effects on creativity and sensorimotor performance mediated through its influence on long distance connectivity  <cit> . smr-theta feedback was visual with eyes open and included a  <dig> second break after  <dig> seconds, for a total of  <dig> such training 'periods', whereas alpha training was auditory and subjects were told to relax in an eyes closed condition, which was uninterrupted for a full  <dig> minutes.

RESULTS
one-way anova disclosed no statistically significant differences between smr, at, and control groups in the number of days that elapsed between pre- and post-training assessments  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). furthermore, one-way anovas confirmed that there were no statistically significant initial baseline differences between smr, at, and control groups in years of prior training  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) or on initial baseline measures of surgical time , technique , and anxiety . direct t-test comparisons between at and smr groups did not reveal significant differences between initial baseline measures of surgical time , or technique [ =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and at  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) groups according to higher and lower performance change scores in task time and overall technique, respectively. no significant differences were detected for initial baseline measures of surgical time or technique between low and high performers within smr and at groups respectively.

surgical time
results averaged across tasks are shown in fig  <dig>  together with the individual "suture" task. a time × group repeated measures anova disclosed in line with hypotheses a main effect of time for task time  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), as seen in fig  <dig>  paired t-tests confirmed that the 26% mean improvement  following smr training differed significantly pre-post , whereas the 12% mean improvement in the at group was not significant , in comparison to a negligible change in the control group . moreover, the smr-group exhibited a significant decrease in the duration of the suture task . regarding overall performance time, there was only a weak tendency for an improvement . there was no significant change in the mean pause time for any of the groups, although interestingly there was a non-significant average increase for the smr-group . as can be seen from table  <dig>  the average baseline task time for the smr group  was slightly higher, albeit non-significantly, than in the at  and control  groups. at post assessment, both smr  and at  neurofeedback groups demonstrated a lower final time in comparison to the control  group, although the difference was not significant according to a one-way anova  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). a similar relationship was seen for the individual 'suture' task . in summary there was a significant improvement in task time following smr training, from a level that was non-significantly longer than in the other groups prior to training to a level comparable to the at group following training. there were no significant changes in the at and control groups. the reduction in task time in the smr group was also paralleled by a reduction in the suture task, regarded as the most complex of the tasks.

alpha-theta , smr-theta , and control  groups and standard deviations 

surgical technique
inter-rater reliability analysis with the intraclass correlation coefficient  between judges' overall scores disclosed satisfactory concordance for all three groups , and especially for the smr group .

average group results are shown in fig  <dig>  in keeping with the objective tests the smr-group showed a reliable improvement from an overall score of  <dig> % to  <dig> % , equivalent to an effect size of d =  <dig> . specifically for the smr-group, there was a significant change in the suture task , with d =  <dig> . in fact, subjective and objective performance measures were interrelated in so far as improvements in overall technique were correlated with reductions in overall task time for the smr-group . regarding the at protocol, while positive mean changes were exhibited overall , the difference did not prove statistically significant. as seen in table  <dig>  the initial overall technique score for the smr group  was somewhat, although not statistically, lower, than in the at  and control  groups. subsequently, both smr  and at  experimental groups demonstrated a higher final score in comparison to the control  group, although this difference was not significant in one-way anova  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). a parallel trend was observed for the technique rating on the 'suture' task .

neurofeedback learning and surgical performance relationships
the mean group results disclosed evidence of learning both within and between sessions. the whole neurofeedback session was divided into 3-minute time blocks called 'periods', starting with period  <dig> which was the feedback-free baseline. periods  <dig> and  <dig> denote the start and end of neurofeedback, respectively. the within session smr/theta ratio increased from baseline to period  <dig> , underpinned by reductions in theta . the at ratios increased reaching a plateau at period  <dig> . across session learning reached a peak with session  <dig> for the smr-group  and with session  <dig> for the at-group .

with the smr-group, there was a tendency for successful within-session smr-training to be associated with an increase in total pause time , while the latter correlated with a lower task time , suggesting a more modulated performance. although at training did not produce significant improvements for the group as a whole, successful within-session at training correlated significantly with overall improvement in surgical technique .

the positive relation between smr learning and improvement in surgical performance was elucidated further with the smr group  being median split into two equal halves of  <dig> subjects, according to each subject's absolute change in surgical task time. the top  <dig> subjects in the group that had the largest reductions in task time were designated as 'high' improvers, whereas the bottom  <dig> were labeled 'low' improvers. mean percentage change of the smr/theta ratio was then computed for each subgroup between the first half  and second half  of the total sessions. there was a group × ratio interaction  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), whereby a 10% highly significant reduction  in the learning ratio in low improvers in the second half which was not found in high improvers . this falloff in learning ratio in low improvers was elucidated by examining absolute eeg bands separately. as shown in fig  <dig>  there was an interaction between group × theta amplitude change  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) whereby the theta amplitude significantly increased in the low improvers in the second half of sessions  compared with a non-significant decrease in high improvers . of relevance to the falloff in training in low improvers, there was also a significantly greater number of days  elapsed between the latter half of training sessions of low versus high improvers ; implying that the longer the intersession interval, the poorer the learning in the direction of training goals.

finally, the same investigative approach when applied to the at group, disclosed a reliable positive change in the eeg ratio when median split according to surgical technique  = - <dig> , p =  <dig> ) in higher versus lower improvers  respectively.

anxiety scale
the spielberger anxiety inventory revealed a significant reduction in trait anxiety for the smr group  compared to the controls  as seen in fig  <dig>  there were no reliable changes in state anxiety, however, when the relation between pre-post anxiety change and eeg training was investigated, a correlation between state anxiety change and at within-session learning  was observed.

discussion
benefits were achieved by trainee opthalmic surgeons in a skills lab simulation of a cataract operation as a result of eight half hour sessions of eeg-neurofeedback training. in particular for the smr-theta group there was a 26% reduction in the total time to perform the tasks , while the most significant change occurred during the more complex of the skills, involving tying a suture following an incision in the artificial cornea. of the four tasks monitored this is the one that took the longest to complete and the one with the most reported difficulty. the objective timed measure of improvement was corroborated by the subjective ratings of the two consultant ophthalmic surgeons on an exam scale of surgical technique . additionally, there was on average an increased pause time between tasks. this 'time for preparation' was positively correlated with reduced task time, indicating a more modulated performance – an increased preparation time coupled with reduced task times. the significant reduction in self-reported anxiety  over the preceding weeks would also be compatible with achieving a more modulated performance.

before considering the results further the experimental limitations of the study should be acknowledged.

in light of the small group sizes anovas on surgical measures did not yield significant interactions between experimental and control protocols, mainly resulting from irregular group variances. moreover, longer term follow-up tests were not conducted in this study, mainly because the rotational system of the national health service does not grant trainee surgeons a permanent locus. these limitations could be minimised in future with greater numbers of subjects and with surgeons of more fixed positions.

random allocation of subjects led to a slightly uneven, albeit not statistically significant , distribution of initial performance measures between groups for both task time and overall technique. there was an initial preferential performance to the at and control groups, leading to the possibility that their ability to improve as had occurred with smr training was compromised. however, regarding time on task, as can be seen in table  <dig>  a mean improvement, albeit non-significant was seen in the at group. furthermore regarding technique scores, participants' scores fell far short of a ceiling effect of 100%.

we also performed analyses on the final  group values of task time and overall technique. as seen in table  <dig>  although both smr and at groups had somewhat lower task time and higher overall technique at post assessment compared to the control group, no significant differences were revealed between groups with one-way anovas. with small sample sizes, there is again the ever-present danger of the 'regression to the mean' effect. also, given our a priori hypotheses regarding surgical improvement, we did not perform a correction for multiple comparisons; however the latter would be of greater concern in cases where variables exhibit greater independence . as described below, the manifest associations between task time change and neurofeedback training indices  in the smr group render random effects of this type less likely.

regarding the subjective ratings of surgical technique  the total inter-rater reliability of  <dig>  is not high enough to establish an explicit conclusion regarding the effects on technique for all the three groups. however, the protocol with the more promising results for surgical training, the smr protocol, demonstrated a good reliability of  <dig> , indicating a clearly positive effect for this group.

one may question the strength of the control protocol given the wait-list design, as the same subjects were used for the control and training assessments, which inevitably leaves room for practice or time effects. however, with regard to practice effects the training change was analysed strictly between back-to-back assessments , so differences that occurred during the previous control period were entirely excluded. furthermore, surplus analyses carried out for changes between first and final assessments of the control group on all variables did not produce any disparate conclusions. test-retest interval times also indicated comparable elapsed time among control and training group assessments.

while comparing two intervention conditions with a no-intervention control group, the issue of therapist contact or 'placebo' effects may be raised. however, taking into consideration the different impact of the two experimental protocols on performance, it seems unlikely that placebo should account for the observed outcome. nevertheless, in order to completely rule out the possibility of placebo, future work would benefit from including a 'sham' neurofeedback control group, instead of a wait-list.

one of the practical difficulties in running the study was the availability of the trainee surgeons to fit the neurofeedback sessions into their busy schedule. some trainees had undesirably long intersession intervals of more than a week which may have led to suboptimal conditions for learning. indeed in the smr group those who improved the most in reducing task time attended on a bi-weekly basis. the practical limitations may have affected training with the alternative at protocol which aims to induce a hypnagogic state and which has demonstrable benefits for peak performance training  <cit> . there was a falling off in the theta/alpha ratio during the last six minutes of the session, as if in anticipation of the session end and the next diary commitment. notwithstanding, while there were no significant advantages for the at group as a whole, learned control of the theta/alpha ratio within sessions correlated positively with ratings of surgical technique, and the median split subdivision based on improvement in technique disclosed that those improving most were the more successful in increasing their theta/alpha ratio between sessions. within session learning was also positively correlated with reduction in state anxiety.

however, the most significant benefits of neurofeedback training were obtained by elevating the low beta sensorimotor rhythm band  while simultaneously inhibiting slow wave theta  activity. the reliability of the effects with this protocol is strengthened by the finding that those participants who showed the greater improvement in time on task were those who showed increased maintenance of the smr/theta ratio as well as a lower number of days between neurofeedback training sessions. the development of surgical skill could be regarded as jointly evolving on levels of both central executive control  and the retention of strict motor procedures. in accordance with this model, our results remain in line with previous research on smr-theta training as a viable method for enhancing executive attention  <cit> , and are further supported by an fmri study  <cit>  reporting plastic changes following training with this neurofeedback protocol in anterior cingulate  as well as caudate nucleus and substantia nigra, central components of motor basal ganglia function. synchronization of the smr low beta rhythm has been found to be directly implicated in motor response inhibition during a go/no-go task  <cit> . moreover, recent evidence indicates that elevated smr activity predicts performance improvements on procedural motor tasks and is related to consolidation of motor tasks following sleep  <cit> , while a latest report suggests direct increases in sleep spindle power following smr neurofeedback are associated with individual enhancement of memory  <cit> . in light of the previously cited studies linking smr, sleep spindle activity, and synaptic plasticity  <cit> , it is possible that smr neurofeedback may have aided the priming and/or preservation of new synaptic connections  <cit>  either before they were consolidated during sleep, or by directly influencing the sleep eeg parameters  <cit>  which putatively modulate the memory mechanisms inherent to sleep  <cit> .

in addition, the protocol required the suppression of theta  amplitude, whose training reduction while significant for the group as a whole, in later sessions became uniquely elevated in the low improvers. decrease in cortical theta power has been reported during activation of the attentional alerting network  <cit> , found to predict better reaction time performance  <cit> , and interpreted as a stronger inhibition of long-term memory networks aiding the processing of external stimuli. moreover, desynchronisation of cortical slow waves, which include the theta range, is an indicator of increased cortical activation, elicited for instance by stimulation of the cholinergic or noradrenergic systems  <cit> . an attractive and tentative explanation might combine the latter with the large body of evidence that pharmacological activation of these systems leads to robust enhancement of ltp and practice-dependent motor learning . new support for this interpretation has emerged from our recent experiment  demonstrating that reductions in alpha and theta power post-neurofeedback coincide with increased corticospinal excitability when assessed with tms . this would support a more modern yet complementary hypothesis of synaptic potentiation occurrence during wakefulness, which has been demonstrated to be causally related to cellular changes dependent on noradrenergic release, such as the induction of ltp-related genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show extensive evidence for performance enhancement in microsurgical procedure by means of eeg self-regulation. more specifically, our data have shown that smr/theta training provides statistically reliable improvements in surgical technique, together with a 26% reduction in time on task. this may lead to reductions in surgical stress, contact time with the eye, and lessen the risk and extent of surgical complications  <cit> , thereby improving surgical outcomes. our results are further supported by good agreements between qualitative and quantitative performance assessment measures.
