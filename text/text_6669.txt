BACKGROUND
phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of the potato and tomato late blight disease, is a successful cosmopolitan plant pathogen. ever since the irish potato famine in the middle of the nineteenth century, p. infestans has been recognized as one of the most problematic plant pathogens with a global impact on both commercial and subsistence agriculture  <cit> . this oomycete pathogen is recalcitrant to low input disease management and requires costly chemical treatments to be managed  <cit> . part of p. infestans success is accounted for by its biological lifestyle and remarkable capacity to rapidly adapt to overcome resistant plants  <cit> . on infected plants, it continuously produces a large number of asexual spores, including sessile aerially dispersed sporangia and motile zoospores, resulting in polycyclic infections and fast spreading late blight epidemics  <cit> . in addition, in many regions of the world, p. infestans reproduces sexually resulting in increased genetic diversity and extended survival in the field  <cit> . based on these biological and epidemiological features, mcdonald and linde concluded that p. infestans is a plant pathogen with a high evolutionary potential that can rapidly evolve virulence on resistant plants  <cit> .

similar to a wide range of animal and plant pathogens, p. infestans secretes proteins, termed effectors, that facilitate parasitic colonization by altering host plant physiology and suppressing immunity  <cit> . p. infestans effector proteins target different sites in host plant tissue  <cit> . first, some effectors act in the extracellular space where they interfere with apoplastic plant defenses. inhibitors of plant extracellular proteases and glucanases are such apoplastic effectors  <cit> . other effectors, such as small cysteine-rich proteins , are also thought to function in the apoplast but their effector activities remain mostly unknown  <cit> . second, a large number of p. infestans effectors, classified as cytoplasmic effectors, are delivered inside host cells using n-terminal secretion and host-translocation signals  <cit> . this is the case for members of the rxlr and crinkler  families. a subset of the rxlr effectors is recognized inside plant cells by intracellular immune receptors of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat  family , resulting in the induction of hypersensitive cell death and immunity  <cit> .

evolutionary and comparative genomics analyses revealed that phytophthora effector genes have undergone accelerated patterns of birth and death evolution with evidence of extensive gene duplication and gene loss in the genomes of p. infestans, p. sojae, and p. ramorum  <cit> . for instance, in p. infestans, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> predicted rxlr genes are part of the "core ortholog" gene set   <cit> . also, effector genes frequently show signatures of positive selection with extensive non-synonymous sequence substitutions, leading to high rates of amino acid polymorphisms  <cit> . in p. infestans, the rxlr and crn gene families are among the most expanded relative to p. sojae and p. ramorum  <cit> . these rxlr and crn genes mostly populate expanded regions of the p. infestans genome that have low gene density and a high abundance of repeats in marked contrast to the housekeeping "core ortholog" gene set that occupy gene-dense and repeat-poor regions  <cit> . haas et al proposed that these gene-poor repeat-rich loci are dynamic regions of the genome that underpin the evolutionary potential of p. infestans by promoting genome plasticity and enhancing genetic variation of effector genes. similarly, virulence genes occur in plastic repeat-rich and telomeric regions in various pathogens, which is thought to increase genetic and epigenetic variation and could result in accelerated evolution  <cit> .

all known oomycete effectors carry n-terminal signal peptides for secretion outside pathogen cells  <cit> . although signal peptide sequences are highly degenerate, robust computational prediction algorithms enable a systematic survey of the secreted protein catalog  from the genome sequence of a given organism  <cit> . in particular, the signalp program that was developed using machine learning methods  <cit> , can assign signal peptide prediction scores and cleavage sites to unknown amino acid sequences with a high degree of accuracy  <cit> . this program turned out to be particularly useful for the prediction of effectors from p. infestans and other filamentous pathogens as numerous signalp predictions have been validated experimentally  <cit> . a combination of computational prediction methods was used recently to generate a database of the secretome from  <dig> fungal and oomycete organisms  <cit> .

in the p. infestans genome, a majority of core ortholog genes occur in gene dense regions  and are excluded from gene sparse regions , which are in contrast enriched in effector genes  <cit> . this distinctive genome organization offers a unique opportunity to identify novel candidate virulence genes. furthermore, although the secretome of p. infestans includes several hundred candidate effectors belonging to multiple classes, additional families of secreted proteins have not been characterized in much detail  <cit> . in this study, we used a computational approach to catalog the secretome of p. infestans strain t30- <dig>  we then defined and identified the "plastic secretome" as the set of secreted protein genes that  do not reside in segments orthologous to p. sojae and p. ramorum genomes, and  reside in the repeat-rich gsrs. this pipeline resulted in  <dig> proteins , of which  <dig> have already been annotated as effectors by haas et al.  <cit> . because the pipeline identified many in planta-induced genes and ~62% of all previously predicted p. infestans effectors, we concluded that the remaining  <dig> proteins from the "plastic secretome" are enriched in novel candidate effectors. in particular, we highlight  <dig> genes that are induced in planta and distinct from known effector families. these analyses implicate trypsin-like serine proteases, berberine-bridge enzymes, carbonic anhydrases, small cysteine-rich proteins and repeat-containing proteins as novel candidate virulence factors.

RESULTS
prediction and annotation of phytophthora infestans secretome
to identify the secretome of p. infestans , we predicted signal peptides using the well-validated signalp v <dig>  and v <dig>  programs and sub-cellular targeting using targetp and psort . to ensure stringent standards, only proteins predicted secreted by the four methods were considered further. to remove proteins likely to be retained into p. infestans plasma membrane we excluded those for which a transmembrane domain was predicted after the signal peptide cleavage site by tmhmm . in total,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  proteins of p. infestans were predicted to form the secretome . to complement existing annotation, we performed detection of protein domains using pfam and superfamily  <dig>  hmm model databases and automated geneontology  terms mapping using blast2go server .

major functional categories enriched in phytophthora infestans secretome
to document biological functions enriched in the p. infestans secretome, we compared the frequency of occurrence of pfam domains and go terms in the secretome to the rest of the proteome using chi-square tests . we found  <dig> "biological process" ontologies,  <dig> "molecular function" ontologies and  <dig> pfam domains to be enriched in the p. infestans secretome. seven "molecular function" ontologies and  <dig> pfam domains were depleted from secretome .

carbohydrate metabolic processes  showed the highest enrichment among biological processes in the p. infestans secretome compared to the rest of the proteome . related biological processes enriched in the secretome include cell wall modification  and organization  processes, as well as catabolism of polysaccharides , specifically cellulose  and xylan . in addition, most of the proteins associated with the sphingolipid metabolic process  and lysosome organization  ontologies show sequence similarity to glycosyl hydrolases indicating that these two ontologies are also mostly related to carbohydrate metabolism in p. infestans secretome. consistently,  <dig> "molecular function" ontologies directly or indirectly related to sugar metabolism are enriched in the secretome . sugar binding  and sugar modification activities  are indeed predominantly found in the p. infestans secretome. furthermore, a majority of proteins associated to glucosylceramidase activity , and cation binding  ontologies show similarity to glycosyl hydrolases. most of the proteins associated to aspartyl esterase activity  and lyase activity  show similarity to polygalacturonases and polysaccharide lyases respectively. this enrichment indicates that sensing extracellular sugar and degrading host cell wall are major functions of the phytophthora secretome as illustrated by several previous studies  <cit> . finally,  <dig> pfam domains enriched in the secretome correspond to enzymes predicted to act on sugars , either as monomers  or polysaccharides, including cellulose , α- and ß- <dig>  glucans , ß- <dig>  glucans , xyloglucans , rhamnoglucans  and pectin . aldose 1-epimerase , responsible for interconversion of d-glucose and other aldoses, completes the list of carbohydrate metabolism-related domains enriched in the p. infestans secretome.

pathogenesis  and defense response  are biological process ontologies highly enriched in p. infestans secretome . the corresponding proteins include some with similarity to elicitins. the molecular function ontology with the highest enrichment in the secretome, endopeptidase inhibitor , corresponds to kazal-like serine protease inhibitors, which have been linked to the infection process as apoplastic effectors  <cit>  . proteins corresponding to the glutamyltransferase activity  show similarity to transglutaminase elicitor-like proteins harboring the pep- <dig> pathogen associated molecular pattern  <cit> . the kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain is also found among pfam domains enriched the in secretome  , together with elicitin domain  and necrosis inducing protein domain . the pfam domain showing the highest enrichment in the secretome is the cysteine-rich pcf domain  that forms a two-alpha helices domain rich in acidic residues and was reported to cause leaf necrosis  <cit> . the pan domain  is another cysteine-rich domain enriched in the p. infestans secretome. the pan domain occurs in the cellulose-binding elicitor-like protein of phytophthora parasitica that causes necrosis and activates immunity in plants  <cit> . several other pfam domains enriched in the p. infestans secretome are cysteine-rich domains of unclear functions, such as the gcc domain , egf-like domain  and the domains of unknown function pf <dig> and pf <dig>  secreted proteins containing these cysteine-rich domains could play a role in plant infection similar to known small cysteine-rich proteins  <cit> . generally, the secretome appears enriched in small  proteins and in proteins rich in cysteine  . similarly, the p. infestans secretome shows higher frequency of proteins with elevated  glycine content . one such example is the ipib family  <cit>  and its corresponding pfam domain pf <dig> .

proteolysis  is a biological process ontology enriched in the p. infestans secretome . consistently, serine type peptidase activity  and peptidase activity  are molecular function ontologies that are also enriched in the p. infestans secretome . acid phosphatase activity  regroups another type of hydrolases enriched in the p. infestans secretome. pfam domains implicated in peptide hydrolysis, namely trypsin domain  and calcineurin domain , which show similarity to acid phosphatases, are enriched in the secretome . in addition, proteins associated to isomerase activity ontology  mainly show similarity to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase or disulfide isomerases. these enzymes are known to accelerate energetically unfavorable cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding a proline to catalyze protein folding  <cit> .

surprisingly, rna processing  appears as a biological process enriched in the p. infestans secretome . consistently, ribonuclease t <dig>  and rna methyltransferase activity  are molecular function ontologies enriched in the secretome . the ribonuclease t <dig>  and spou rrna methylase  are pfam domains also enriched in the secretome . rna cleavage by ribonuclease t <dig> was shown to be implicated in defense and self-incompatibility processes  <cit> . some of these proteins might be effectors that are translocated inside plant cells to alter host transcription or dna/rna metabolism. extracellular nucleases have been described in the fungi ustilago maydis and aspergillus spp.  <cit> .

proteins related to oxidoreduction were also particularly abundant in the p. infestans secretome. secreted proteins classified under the one-carbon metabolic process ontology   show similarity to carbonic anhydrase enzymes, catalyzing the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons. the corresponding pfam domain  is enriched in the p. infestans secretome . monooxygenase activity  and monophenol monooxygenase activity  are molecular function ontologies enriched in the secretome . also enriched in the secretome are tyrosinase pfam domain , found in copper monooxygenases involved in the formation of pigments and polyphenolic compounds, and peroxidase pfam domains . fad-binding domain  and berberine-like domain , which occur in the same set of secreted proteins, complete the list of oxidoreduction-related domains enriched in the secretome.

other ontologies enriched in the p. infestans secretome include generic activities such as catalytic  and hydrolase  activities, associated largely to predicted glycosyl hydrolases. copper ion binding  is another molecular function enriched in the secretome. the pheromone activity  enriched in the secretome is found in proteins similar to temptins, which mediates protein-cell surface contact during fertilization in mollusks  <cit> . a phospholipase d  motif  is among the pfam domains enriched in the p. infestans secretome. phytophthora pld activities were proposed to be involved in zoospore encystment  <cit>  and host membrane modification  <cit>  but these secreted plds could target host membranes.

molecular function ontologies depleted from the p. infestans secretome  are generic binding activity  and more specifically zinc ion binding , protein binding  and nucleotide- and nucleoside-binding . protein-protein interaction pfam domains such as wd  and ankyrin repeat  are depleted from the p. infestans secretome, together with the protein kinase domain  and abc transporter domain .

delimitation of gene dense and gene sparse regions in the p. infestans genome
because the gsrs of the p. infestans genome are highly enriched in rxlr and crn effector genes, we hypothesized that this property could be used to identify novel effector candidates. first, we needed to determine quantitative parameters that distinguish between gdrs and gsrs. to achieve this, we simulated core ortholog genes content in gdrs and gsrs  using values of the length 'l' of flanking intergenic regions  between genes ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb . genes with both firs above l were considered gsr genes, whereas genes with both firs below l were considered gdr genes. core ortholog segregation rate was defined as the difference between the core ortholog content of the gdrs vs. gsrs . for low l values, many core orthologs were excluded from the gdrs since only very tightly packed genes were assigned to them. on the other hand, with larger l values, more genes were assigned to gsrs progressively reducing the proportion represented by the core orthologs. the highest segregation value was obtained for l =  <dig>  kb. at this cutoff, 90% of the core orthologs were assigned to gdrs  and constituted 55% of the gdr genes. in contrast, at l =  <dig>  kb, only  <dig> % of gsr genes were core orthologs. we therefore selected l =  <dig>  kb for subsequent analyses because this value provided the best segregation between the core ortholog and effector genes into the gdr and gsr genomic compartments.

the  <dig>  kb cutoff delimits four coherent gene pools when combined with the 2-variables binning representation previously performed by haas et al.  <cit>  . the gdrs  contain  <dig> genes representing  <dig> % of p. infestans genes. the gsrs  include  <dig> genes, corresponding to  <dig> % of the genes. the other two quadrants group genes with asymmetric firs, one shorter than  <dig>  kb and the other one longer. we counted  <dig>  genes residing at the border of gdrs and gsrs. finally,  <dig> genes  were omitted because they lack one resolved fir  or overlap with other genes.

an example of a genome browser view further illustrates the organization of a representative genome region into gdrs and gsrs . this  <dig> kb area of p. infestans supercontig  <dig>  contains a  <dig> kb gsr flanked by short gdrs. as opposed to gsr genes, all the gdr genes belong to genome segments orthologous to the p. sojae or p. ramorum genomes. all the secreted protein genes in this region occur in the gsr.

gene sparse regions are enriched in secreted proteins
gsrs contain  <dig> % of the secretome genes even though they contain only  <dig> % of the total p. infestans genes . consistent with previous analyses by haas et al.  <cit> , gsrs contain  <dig> % of the effector genes, and more specifically  <dig> % of the rxlr and  <dig> % of the crn genes. compared to the whole genome, the gsrs show a two-fold enrichment in secreted protein genes, and a three-fold enrichment in effector genes.

in addition,  <dig> % of secretome,  <dig> % of effector,  <dig> % of rxlr and  <dig> % of crn genes are excluded from the gdrs . of the known effectors, only  <dig> % are found in the gdrs, with only  <dig> out of  <dig> rxlr effector genes and  <dig> out of  <dig> crn genes.

the "plastic secretome" of p. infestans: secretome genes excluded from genome segments orthologous to p. sojae or p. ramorum and residing in gsrs
one defining feature of p. infestans effector genes is that they have significantly diverged from their counterparts in p. sojae and p. ramorum and are typically excluded from orthologous segments  <cit> . orthologous segments  are defined as genome segments derived from a common ancestor without large rearrangements, therefore containing genes showing homology, collinearity, conserved order and orientation in different species  <cit>  . we found that although only  <dig> %  of the total genes and  <dig> % of the secretome genes are excluded from segments orthologous between at least two of the examined phytophthora species, this proportion reaches  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for all effector, rxlr and crn genes, respectively . we therefore hypothesized that we could significantly enrich in candidate effector genes using the combination of three criteria:  secreted protein,  exclusion from os, and  occurrence in the gsrs or fir not determined. in total,  <dig> genes fulfilled these three criteria . genome regions showing frequent re-arrangements, particularly in pathogenic bacteria, have been referred to as "plasticity zones"  <cit> . we therefore refer to the  <dig> gene set identified here as the "plastic secretome" of p. infestans to reflect their localization in plastic genome regions.

the plastic secretome is highly enriched in effectors
of the  <dig> genes assigned to the plastic secretome,  <dig>  are annotated as effectors. also, even though the  <dig> genes correspond to less than  <dig> % of the whole genome, they include  <dig> % of all known effector genes . this clearly indicates that the plastic secretome is highly enriched in effectors and that the remainder  <dig> genes are likely to be enriched in novel candidate virulence genes.

genes from the plastic secretome are enriched in genes induced in planta
to identify candidate virulence genes among the genes from the plastic secretome, we used the whole-genome microarray expression data of p. infestans infection time course on potato and tomato  <cit> . overall, the genes from the plastic secretome showed a higher proportion of genes induced in planta relative to the remainder of the genes . in particular, during the early biotrophic phase of infection  8-16% of the genes from the plastic secretome are induced relative to less than  <dig> % of the remaining genes . in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes from the plastic secretome were classified as induced in at least one of the in planta time points tested .

in planta induced genes from the plastic secretome underpin novel candidate virulence genes
we examined in more details  <dig> genes from the plastic secretome that have not been previously annotated as effector genes and are induced in planta . five candidates were annotated as cell wall degrading enzymes : pitg_ <dig> and pitg_ <dig> show similarity to pectin lyases, pitg_ <dig> has an aldose 1-epimerase domain found in some groups of glycoside hydrolases, pitg_ <dig> is related to arabinofuranosidase, and pitg_ <dig> has a jacalin-like lectin domain predicted to bind mannose. four candidates have other predicted enzymatic activity, including trypsin-like serine protease activity , oxidoreductase activity  and putative mannose processing activity . two candidates are effector-like proteins: pitg_ <dig> is a truncated rxlr effector that was missed in earlier annotations  <cit>  and pitg_ <dig> possess the pep <dig> motif found in transglutaminase elicitors. three candidates are repeat-containing proteins : pitg_ <dig> and pitg_ <dig> have glycine-rich motifs while pitg_ <dig> harbors lysine-rich repeats. two candidates are small cysteine-rich proteins  not previously described. finally, three candidates  do not have significant similarities to known proteins and sequence motifs. some of these candidates are described in more details hereafter.

secreted trypsin-like serine proteases related to glucanase inhibitor proteins
pitg_ <dig> encodes a predicted trypsin-like serine protease related to glucanase inhibitor proteins , which are catalytically inactive proteases that function as apoplastic effectors  <cit> . pitg_ <dig> belongs to a family of  <dig> paralogs in p. infestans among which  <dig> are predicted to be secreted . only two out of the  <dig> corresponding genes reside in gdrs . unlike the gips, the catalytic triad of pitg_ <dig> is intact suggesting a functional serine protease . similar to some gip genes , pitg_ <dig> and its closest paralogs pitg_ <dig> and pitg_ <dig> are induced in planta at  <dig> dpi .

berberine bridge enzymes
pitg_ <dig> has similarity to berberine bridge enzyme  genes. bbes are flavoenzymes related to oligosaccharide oxidases found in archaea, bacteria, plants and fungi. they are involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species and in the synthesis of alkaloids in plants. five bbe isoforms were predicted in the p. infestans genome, all of which harbor a predicted signal peptide. to gain insights into the impact of sequence polymorphisms on the activity of these enzymes, we aligned the bbe sequences to well characterized homologs from plants and fungi  and modeled the 3d structure of p. infestans bbes . all five p. infestans bbes possess the three residues required for fad cofactor binding in fungal glucooligosaccharide oxidases  and show a good conservation of the fad-binding and bbe domains compared to their plant and fungal counterparts . polymorphic residues within the p. infestans bbe clade are mostly found in the sugar-binding region . the substrate binding groove region of phytophthora bbes  is divergent from bbes in other species. the binding groove is widely open in fungal goox presumably to accommodate a range of substrates. in contrast, the binding groove in the p. infestans modeled bbe is largely obstructed by a coil of amino acids running from one side to the other of the binding pocket . these observations suggest that p. infestans bbes may have evolved to recognize a distinct set of substrates relative to their fungal and plant counterparts. p. infestans bbe genes are all excluded from gdrs  and are either weakly  or strongly  induced at  <dig> dpi in planta .

alpha carbonic anhydrases
pitg_ <dig> was annotated as an alpha-carbonic anhydrase . the p. infestans genome encodes  <dig> predicted α-cas among which seven belong to the secretome. to explore the structural properties of the p. infestans α-cas, we aligned their sequences to the closest human homologs and to tobacco nec <dig> α-ca , and modeled the 3d structure of pitg_ <dig> and pitg_ <dig> . when compared to human and tobacco homologs, p. infestans α-cas show a conserved core surrounding the active site  with conserved catalytic residues . on the contrary, regions at the surface of the enzyme are variable between p. infestans α-cas and differ from human and tobacco enzymes . this notably results in the absence in the p. infestans enzymes of an alpha helix gating the entry of the zinc-binding pocket in human enzymes. residues in this alpha helix are in close proximity with sulfonamide inhibitor in human models suggesting that p. infestans α-cas may have evolved alternative docking properties at the entrance of the zinc-binding groove. all p. infestans α-ca genes, except pitg_ <dig>  are excluded from gdrs . whereas the p. infestans α-ca genes that encode non-secreted enzymes are not induced in planta , most of the genes encoding secreted α-cas are strongly induced either early  or late  during plant infection .

novel small cysteine-rich  proteins
many filamentous pathogen effectors encode small  secreted proteins with an even number of cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges  <cit> . we found  <dig> small  cysteine-rich  in p. infestans . among them,  <dig> are predicted to be secreted, 17% of which are induced in planta . in particular, pitg_ <dig> is a gene from the plastic secretome that encodes a  <dig> amino acid scr with six cysteines . it has one close paralog  that encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with the six cysteine residues conserved. pitg_ <dig> is induced in planta during the biotrophic phase similar to previously studied scr effectors such as scr <dig>  scr <dig>  and scr <dig> 

repeat containing proteins 
many microbial adhesins are repetitive proteins with different types of repeats, such as glycine-rich repeats. some oomycete repeat containing proteins are secreted proteins that are thought to function in adhesion, and include p. infestans mucin-like protein car <dig>  <cit> , ipib  <cit> , and m <dig> mating-specific proteins  <cit> . several of the p. infestans genes from the plastic secretome that are induced in planta encode repeat-containing proteins not described to date. pitg_ <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with more than 30% glycine residues due to  <dig> gg repeats. it has one close paralog in p. infestans, pitg_ <dig> . the pitg_ <dig> gene is induced during the biotrophic phase of potato infection .

pitg_ <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with  <dig> glycine residues organized in  <dig> imperfect ggsxet repeats . this gene lacks paralogs in p. infestans, and this class of repeats is absent from other p. infestans proteins. pitg_ <dig> is induced two-fold during the biotrophic phase of potato infection .

besides glycine-rich repeat containing proteins, pitg_ <dig> is a  <dig> amino acid protein that contains  <dig> lysine residues organized in  <dig> kke repeats followed by  <dig> dxgekskkx repeats . the same repeat pattern was observed in the sequence of the protein encoded by the paralogous gene pitg_ <dig>  pitg_ <dig> is induced during the biotrophic phase of potato infection .

discussion
we exploited genome organization to augment other criteria for selection of candidate virulence genes in the oomycete plant pathogen p. infestans. based on the work of haas et al. , genome organization appears to be a good indicator of virulence genes in p. infestans. can this strategy be extended to explore and identify novel effectors from other pathogens? effector genes often occur in plastic genomic regions. a remarkable example is the plant pathogenic fungus leptosphaeria maculans in which the avrlm <dig>  avrlm <dig> and avrlm4- <dig> effector genes reside in  <dig> kb or larger at-rich gene-poor isochores  <cit> . in other plant pathogenic fungi, such as alternaria alternata  <cit> , mycosphaerella graminicola  <cit> , and fusarium graminearum  <cit> , some effector genes are carried in conditionally dispensable chromosomes. localization of effectors in plastic genome regions also extends to animal pathogens. host-translocated effectors from plasmodium are often found near telomeric regions of chromosomes  <cit> . these specific effector genome niches in eukaryotic pathogens are reminiscent of the highly variable bacterial pathogenicity islands that carry clustered translocation machinery and effector genes  <cit> . in summary, localization of effector genes to dedicated plastic regions of pathogen genomes is a frequent occurrence. the strategy we applied in this work enabled the identification of previously overlooked candidate virulence genes and is in principle applicable to a wide range of eukaryotic pathogenic microorganisms.

plastic genome regions can take several forms such as dispensable chromosomes or telomeric regions. are there conserved features that characterize plastic genome regions? how can we recognize them? high density of active mobile dna transposable elements  can be considered a signature of variable genome regions. tes have long been considered "selfish genes" for causing chromosomal breaks, deletions, or translocations  <cit> . but several studies now show that tes are major drivers of rapid evolution and functional diversification of gene families  <cit>  as well as evolution of gene regulation  <cit> . tes tend to accumulate around genes involved in stress response, defense and response to external cues  <cit> . the length of the intergenic regions flanking each gene reflects the impact of tes on local gene density. analysis of the distribution of firs helps to visualize localized and differential te activity and to identify plastic genome regions  <cit> . in this regard, p. infestans stands out by its dramatic uneven distribution in fir lengths that results in a clear demarcation of gdrs vs gsrs . this extreme property of the p. infestans genome allowed us to quantify the degree of association between effector genes and plastic genome regions. clearly, effector genes almost exclusively reside in gsrs, supporting a contribution of te activity to effector evolution .

among the novel candidate virulence genes we identified, there were two types of oxidoreductases . the presence of enzymes catalyzing conversion of rather simple molecules within the plastic secretome of p. infestans is perhaps surprising. what role may such catalytic enzymes play in the interaction between p. infestans and host plants? how do polymorphisms in these enzymes affect host interactions? bbes are flavoenzymes that catalyze carbohydrate oxidation in plants, either for the biosynthesis of berberine type alkaloids, or for the generation of hydrogen peroxide . plant bbes are highly induced during various defense responses, when they may contribute to the oxidative burst leading to cell death, through h2o <dig> synthesis. cas typically function in acid-base balance control by rapidly converting carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. ca activity is also required for the onset of disease resistance in tobacco. silencing of a ca gene in the plant nicotiana benthamiana results in enhanced susceptibility to p. infestans  <cit>  and a salicylic acid binding protein sabp <dig> exhibiting ca activity is required for the onset of the hypersensitive response toward the bacterial plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit> . therefore oxidoreductases might be involved in triggering or enhancing host cell death responses during the necrotrophic phase of p. infestans growth. alternatively, h2o <dig> production may contribute to plant cell wall degradation by p. infestans. the ability to degrade alkaloids may also contribute to virulence of various plant pathogens  <cit> , for instance by counteracting antimicrobial properties of plant-synthesized alkaloids  and sulfonamides   <cit> . in any case, it is possible that evasion of plant inhibitors  contributes to rapid evolution in p. infestans secreted bbe and α-ca enzymes. plant secondary metabolites are structurally highly diverse, and their corresponding biosynthetic genes are frequently associated with divergent genome regions  <cit> . plant-pathogen arms race coevolution might result in a parallel highly divergent detoxification arsenal in pathogen genome. the examples of bbe and α-ca described here emphasize the need for integrated metabolomic surveys of plant-pathogen interactions.

cell wall degrading enzymes  are a hallmark of filamentous pathogen secretomes  <cit> . a diverse repertoire of secreted cwdes matches the variety of sugar polymers that make up plant cell walls. two p. infestans genes from the plastic secretome, pitg_ <dig> and pitg_ <dig>  are predicted pectin lyases, which are known in other pathogens as virulence factors that degrade the pectic components of plant cell walls  <cit> . another gene from the plastic secretome, pitg_ <dig>  is related to concanavalin a lectins/glucanases, which carry out the acid catalysis of beta-glucans  <cit>  or function in cell recognition in eukaryotes  <cit> . in plants, lectins show a wide variety of protein structures and sugar binding properties that matches the diversity of sugar molecules  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to correlate the diversity of p. infestans secreted cwdes to the complexity of the plant cell wall. but how to explain the high divergence observed in the cwdes in plastic regions? first, plant cell walls are highly variable from one plant species to another and between different stages of plant development  <cit> . therefore secreted cwdes genes residing in plastic genome regions may have enabled faster adaptation to a new host or tissue . second, plants have evolved a number of cwde inhibitors as a pathogen defense mechanism  <cit> . rapid evolution in p. infestans secreted cwdes may have been driven by arms race coevolution with host inhibitors. third, cell wall degradation products can act as damage-induced molecular patterns  and trigger plant immune responses  <cit> . p. infestans cwdes may therefore evolve to minimize damp induction. in summary, localization of particular carbohydrate binding protein genes in plastic genomic regions may have contributed to the pathogenic success of p. infestans.

it is well accepted that due to metabolic costs and spatial constraints, genome expansion is globally selected against unless it provides an important functional advantage  <cit> . although evidence for the contribution of non-coding dna expansion to gene evolution continues to accumulate, the mechanisms that enable faster gene evolution remain poorly understood. unlike housekeeping genes, most effector genes show a "patchy" phylogenetic distribution, being present in p. infestans but lacking in p. sojae and p. ramorum. similar properties are typical of the virulence genes of a variety of fungal and oomycete pathogens  <cit> . this can be due to high rates of mutations, gene loss, copy number variation , or horizontal gene transfer that are thought to occur more frequently in plastic regions of the genome. one example is the large specific deletion spanning avrlm <dig> that is responsible for gain of virulence on rlm <dig> plants in l. maculans  <cit> . similar gene deletions were reported for several fungal plant pathogen avirulence loci, such as avr <dig> and avr4e of clasdosporium fulvum  <cit> , six <dig> of fusarium oxysporum  <cit>  and avr1-co <dig> and avr-pita of magnaporthe grisea  <cit> . additionally, an excess of cnv and increased sequence polymorphisms were noted toward chromosomal ends in plasmodium spp.  <cit> . such genome remodeling might preferentially occur in regions with extensive non-coding dna because of reduced deleterious consequences to cis-linked genes  <cit> . another hypothesis is that longer flanking regions enable the development of more tightly and accurately regulated expression patterns  <cit> , possibly through epigenetic variation  <cit> . future comparative genomics of clusters of closely related pathogen species will help to further clarify the mechanisms underlying rapid evolution of plastic genome regions and to test these various hypotheses.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we predicted and annotated the secretome of the irish potato famine pathogen p. infestans using in silico approaches. we quantitatively described p. infestans genome organization by delimiting gene dense and gene sparse regions. we used genome organization as a novel approach that augments previously established criteria to mine for candidate virulence factors. occurrence of secreted protein genes in gsrs, in combination with comparative genomics and transcriptomics, implicated  <dig> previously overlooked genes in virulence. these include cell wall degrading enzymes, trypsin-like serine protease, carbonic anhydrase, berberine bridge enzyme, several repeat containing proteins, and small cysteine-rich proteins.
