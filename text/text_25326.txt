BACKGROUND
senescence marker protein- <dig> , a  <dig> kda protein, is preferentially expressed in hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelia. smp <dig> is unique in that, its expression is maintained at a high level throughout the tissue maturation process, then decreases in an androgen-independent manner during senescent stages in both sexes  <cit> . analysis of murine genomic clone revealed that smp <dig> is organized into seven exons and six introns spanning approximately  <dig>  kb. the full length cdna fragment  contains an open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding  <dig> amino acids. cloned smp <dig> promoter is approximately  <dig> kb in length and up to - <dig>  kb of upstream promoter region has been sequenced  <cit> . we have further sequenced upstream region - <dig> to - <dig> bp, and the sequence is available from the ncbi database under the accession number eu <dig>  smp <dig> knockout mice though are viable and fertile have reduced body weight and life span. smp <dig> deficiency in mice causes an accumulation of neural lipids and phospholipids in liver and shortens the life span  <cit> . smp <dig> plays an important role in maintaining calcium homeostasis as it blunts down cell death caused by intracellular accumulation of calcium by enhancing plasma membranes calcium pumping activity  <cit> . it also plays a profound role in rescuing cells from cellular injuries such as apoptosis and hypoxia  <cit> . besides, smp <dig> functions as gluconolactonase in l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis, and its knockout mice are prone to scurvy  <cit> . recently, we have also reported the alteration of smp <dig> expression in hyperthyroidism  <cit> . considering the immense importance of smp <dig> in aging and in general physiology of an organism, it is highly essential to understand the mechanism of smp <dig> gene expression. regulation of gene expression at transcriptional level is mediated by the interaction of trans-acting factors with cis-acting dna sequences on the promoter region of the genes. thus, the cross-talk between trans-acting regulatory factors and cis-acting regulatory elements may be important for regulation of smp <dig> gene expression. the identification of cis-regulatory elements are therefore central and detailed analyses of cis-regulatory mechanisms controlling critical transcription factor will be required in order to understand the transcriptional regulation of smp <dig> gene. previously, we reported dnase i footprinting on smp <dig> promoter up to - <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site and identified eight nuclear factor dna binding sites in this region excluding - <dig> to - <dig> bp  <cit> . the aim of the present study is to characterize and decipher the mechanism of smp <dig> gene expression and regulation. in elucidating the mechanism that endow potent and regulated expression of smp <dig>  detailed characterization of the promoter is highly desirable. to characterize smp <dig> promoter we carried out dna-protein interaction study by dnase i footprinting studies from - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. in this region about twenty eight putative transcription factor binding sites have been identified of which ten transcription factor binding sites were confirmed by competitive emsa. further, to access the transcriptional mechanism of smp <dig> gene expression and regulation, we have carried out for the first time 5' and 3' serial deletion of smp <dig> promoter and subsequently cloned into luciferase reporter vector. transient transfection and luciferase assay illustrated the region of smp <dig> promoter between -128/+ <dig> bp , having significant promoter activity. progressive deletion study confirmed the presence of a repressor element between - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp. dnase i footprinting assay was carried out to chalk out the repressor elements, which revealed the presence of three dnase i protected sites. analysis of these sequences with tfsearch showed the binding of cdxa, gata <dig> and sry transcription factors. transient transfection of individual site-directed mutated constructs into rag cells and luciferase assay showed an increase in reporter activity for all the three mutated constructs.

since mutation of sry region  showed maximum reporter activity, we suggest sry along with cdxa and gata- <dig> may be acting as a major negative regulator of this gene. binding of sry, gata- <dig> and cdxa to their respective sites were confirmed by competitive emsa. another interesting feature of smp <dig> gene promoter is location of sp <dig> and c/ebpβ transcription factor binding sites adjacent to each other. here, we also report that though the presence of these two transcription factor binding sites to minimal promoter region  did not show any significant change in reporter activity as compared to luc- <dig>  but mutation of both the transcription factor binding site enhanced the reporter activity significantly by 23%. this suggests either direct or indirect interaction between sp <dig> and c/ebpβ occurs at transcriptional level in presence of other regulatory factor in smp <dig> promoter which causes repression in smp <dig> gene promoter activity.

RESULTS
identification of dnase i protected sites on smp <dig> promoter
we have previously identified eight transcription factor binding sites within  <dig>  kb mouse smp <dig> promoter fragment by dnase i footprinting and emsa  <cit> . in this study we further investigated the transcription factor binding sites by dnase i footprinting assay on smp <dig> promoter region between -2750/- <dig> bp using rat liver nuclear extract. the primers used for footprinting study of the above mentioned regions are shown in table  <dig>  within this region, twenty eight dnase i protected sites were identified  and a representative of three dnase i footprinting sites of the regions -1208/- <dig> bp, -1491/- <dig> bp and -2028/- <dig> bp are shown .

confirmation of identified transcription factor binding site through electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
all the dnase i protected sequences were analyzed in transcription factor data base  which revealed binding sites sequence homology to multiple transcription factors. to demonstrate the specificity of transcription factors binding sites to the dnase i protected regions, we carried out emsa and/or supershift assay. we synthesized oligonucleotides  corresponding to the protected sites  and prepared radiolabeled duplexes for emsa studies. five dnase i protected sites were identified in the region -1208/- <dig> bp of which fp  <dig> and fp  <dig> have been confirmed by emsa . to fp  <dig> site binding of c/ebpβ was confirmed by competition with cold c/ebp oligonucleotide and also by c/ebpβ antibody shift experiments. binding of gata- <dig> to fp  <dig> is confirmed by competition experiments. four dnase i protected sites were detected in the region -1491/- <dig> bp. though tfsearch revealed the binding gata- <dig>  gata- <dig>  gata- <dig> and aml-1a in order of decreasing binding affinity, only aml-1a competed with fp  <dig> site . similarly tfsearch revealed the binding of lyf- <dig> and gata- <dig> to fp <dig>  only cold gata- <dig> oligonucleotide competed with fp  <dig> but not lyf- <dig> thus confirming the binding of gata- <dig> to fp <dig> . three dnase i protected sites were detected in -2028/- <dig> bp region. binding of no transcription factor up to 80% was observed in tfsearch to fp  <dig>  thus it may be a novel transcription factor binding site . binding of sry to fp  <dig> is confirmed by competition studies . table  <dig> shows all the dnase i protected sites confirmed by emsa .

elucidation of mechanism of smp <dig> gene expression and regulation
to elucidate the mechanism of smp <dig> gene expression, both 5' and 3' deletion constructs were sub-cloned into pgl <dig> luciferase plasmid and transiently transfected into rag cells. the 5' -serially deleted constructs are -920/+ <dig>  -710/+ <dig>  -513/+ <dig>  -352/+ <dig>  -240/+ <dig> and -128/+ <dig>  the 3' -serially deleted constructs are +157/- <dig> and +104/- <dig>  the expression pattern of 5' -serially deleted constructs is shown in figure  <dig>  the 5' -deleted -128/+ <dig> bp construct  showed highest reporter activity among others. in order to delineate the basal promoter activity further, we carried out transfection of 3' -deletion construct into rag cells. the construct -128/+ <dig> bp showed ~ 28% reduction in reporter activity . thus, the region between -128/+ <dig> bp is essential in determining the promoter activity of smp <dig> gene and sequence between + <dig> bp to + <dig> bp plays a detrimental role during transcription.

identification of sry, gata- <dig> and cdxa like transcription factor as a repressor element present between - <dig> and - <dig> bp
the reporter assay of 5' -serially deleted constructs showed a drastic decline  of activity of luc- <dig>  as compared to luc- <dig> . dnase i footprinting study of the region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp revealed three distinct dnase i protected sites such as luc 3– <dig>  luc 3– <dig> and luc 3– <dig> . tfsearch revealed the binding of cdxa to luc 3– <dig>  gata- <dig> to luc 3– <dig> and sry to luc 3– <dig>  to pin point the transcription factor which act as a repressor we prepared site directed mutated constructs for all the three sites. transient transfection of these mutated constructs was carried out along with wild type luc  <dig>  . mutation of luc3- <dig> leads to increase in reporter activity by 29%, luc3- <dig> by 27% and luc 3– <dig> site leads to maximum increase in reporter activity about 59%. this result revealed sry, cdxa and gata- <dig> as the major repressor elements. to further establish this fact, we did emsa study using both wild type and mutated oligonucleotide of luc3- <dig> site. the wild type luc3- <dig> oligonucleotide competed with sry specific cold oligonucleotide consensus, but mutated 3– <dig> site did not show any binding, thus establishing the binding of sry to this site . the competitive emsa using radiolabeled luc3- <dig> oligonucleotide showed 100% competition with gata- <dig> , while emsa using radiolabeled luc 3– <dig> which has 85% homology revealed that although there is competition by unlabeled luc 3– <dig> oligonucleotide, no significant competition is observed using consensus cdxa site. considering the high homology to cdx a consensus binding site, luc 3– <dig> site may be interacting with cdxa like transcription factor with slight deviation in binding sequence .

sp <dig> and c/ebpβ causes repression of smp <dig> promoter activity
smp <dig> gene promoter has a sp <dig> and a c/ebpβ transcription factor binding site adjacent to each other. sp <dig> site spans between - <dig> to - <dig> bp and c/ebpβ spans between - <dig> to - <dig> bp. here we report that, presence of these two sites in the minimal promoter region did not cause any significant change in reporter activity . but site-directed mutation of both the transcription factor binding site caused a significant increase in reporter activity  . individual mutation of only sp <dig> and c/ebpβ did not contribute to any significant change in reporter activity. mutation of sp <dig> site reduced the reporter activity by only 16% and mutation of c/ebpβ lead to enhancement of reporter activity by only 14% . binding of sp <dig> to the region between - <dig> to - <dig> bp is confirmed by competitive emsa done in presence of  <dig> fold molar excess of cold sp <dig> consensus . emsa was also carried out using labeled mutated sp <dig> oligonucleotide, which showed no dna-protein interaction, thus confirming the inability of sp <dig> to bind to the mutated site. binding of c/ebpβ to the region -190/- <dig> bp is confirmed by emsa and antibody shift experiments using c/ebpβ antibody . emsa study carried out with labeled mutated c/ebp oligonucleotide also yielded a dna-protein complex. but this complex is not due to binding of c/ebpβ as confirmed by competition with c/ebpβ consensus and antibody shift experiments .

discussion
the multiple biological functions of smp <dig> in diverse target cells require its expression to be regulated precisely. it is suggested that the transcriptional regulation of a particular gene is a complex process which usually involves interaction between multiple cis-acting regulatory elements and their cognate protein factors  <cit> . a growing list of transcription factors has been shown to function as either transcriptional activator or repressor in different gene promoter. in this study we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of smp <dig> gene by dnase i footprinting, emsa and functional characterization by transient transfection, reporter assay of 5' and 3' -serially deleted promoter reporter constructs and site-directed mutagenesis. we have earlier reported eight nuclear factor binding sites on smp <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . in this report twenty eight new dnase i footprinting sites were identified using rat liver nuclear extract. we also demonstrate that the 5' -flanking regions of smp <dig> gene possess a functional promoter when transfected into rag cells. the results of 5' and 3' -deletion analysis illustrated the region -128/+ <dig> bp possesses significant reporter activity. the presence of a tata sequence  and a caat box  were previously reported respective to the transcription start site  <cit> . our results suggest that the tata and caat box located between - <dig> bp and + <dig> bp plays an important role in determining the promoter activity and sufficient to drive smp <dig> gene expression. 3' – deletion from + <dig> bp to + <dig> bp resulted in ~28% decrease in basal promoter activity, thus indicating that this region is essential for smp <dig> gene expression. an interesting feature of smp <dig> promoter is the presence of c/ebpβ binding site adjacent to sp <dig> binding site. sp <dig> is a ubiquitous dna-binding protein with three zinc finger at its c-terminal that activates the transcription of many cellular and viral genes  <cit> . smp <dig> promoter possess a sp <dig> binding site between - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp. c/ebpβ belongs to ccaat-enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors, involved in different cellular response like in control of cellular proliferation, growth and differentiation, metabolism, immune response and many others. c/ebpβ binding site spans between - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp on smp <dig> promoter. this spatial arrangement of c/ebpβ and sp <dig> is critical as sp <dig> is known to recruit c/ebpβ to cryptic c/ebp site  <cit> . presence of these two sites in the minimal promoter region represented as luc- <dig> did not show any significant change in luciferase activity as compared to the luc- <dig>  but mutation of both sp <dig> and c/ebpβ significantly enhanced the reporter gene activity to about 23%. thus, it is reasonable to believe that direct or indirect interaction between sp <dig> and c/ebpβ in presence of some other regulatory factor occurs at transcriptional level in smp <dig> promoter which causes a repression in smp <dig> promoter activity. transient transfection of 5' -deletion fragments revealed the presence of a repressor element between - <dig> to - <dig> bp, as deletion of this region caused 41% decrease in reporter activity. our dnase i footprinting study showed three putative transcription factor binding sites within this region . in order to confirm the potential repressor among these dnase i protected sites, we carried out site directed mutagenesis studies of these three sites and subsequent transfection along with wild type . this result suggested a significant enhancement of reporter activity of luc 3– <dig> mutated fragment by ~59%, luc3- <dig> by 27% and luc 3– <dig> by 29%. . tfsearch indicated the binding of sry to wild type site luc 3– <dig>  gata- <dig> to luc 3– <dig> and cdxa to luc 3– <dig> sequences, which is confirmed by competitive emsa. earlier reports depicted the tissue specific expression of sry in testes  <cit>  where it involve in testes determination and differentiation in mammals. though expression of sry in substantia nigra of adult male rodents in tyrosin hydroxylase expressing neurons has also been reported but its expression in liver and kidney is still obscure  <cit> . so the identified transcription factors might be sry like proteins which bind to a similar binding site as sry. the affinity of sry for double-stranded dna varies with dna sequence and shares a conserved dna binding domain  nacaat  <cit> . sry is reported to bind and negatively regulates the androgen receptor gene promoter  <cit> . we also suggest that gata- <dig> and cdxa might be interacting directly or indirectly with sry to bring about repression of smp <dig> gene.

CONCLUSIONS
transcription factors sp <dig>  c/ebpβ, sry, gata- <dig> and cdxa, binding within - <dig> of smp <dig> promoter, have significant role in regulation of smp <dig> gene expression.
