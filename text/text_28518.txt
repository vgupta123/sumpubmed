BACKGROUND
tight junction proteins combine to form an important barrier which serves to limit paracellular transport in epithelial cell lines  <cit> . important studies have identified occludin  <cit> , junctional adhesion molecule   <cit>  and the claudins  <cit>  as tight junction proteins that restrict molecular movement within the paracellular space. these tight junction proteins form a dynamic seal between epithelial cells becoming the principle physical paracellular barrier. the extracellular domains of adjacent occludin or claudin molecules form interactions that restrict diffusion  <cit> . the claudin family, with now more than twenty members, has garnered much attention due to the heterogeneous expression patterns observed in a variety of epithelia and endothelial cell types. complex arrays of claudin species with unique distribution patterns are found in each segment of the kidney  <cit> ; for instance the distal tubule contained measurable expression of both claudin- <dig> and - <dig>  mdck ii cells express claudin- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> , the expression of claudin- <dig> in the mdck ii cells is in part responsible for its low electrical resistance profile  <cit> .

the response of the kidney epithelium to inflammatory mediators is complex; an early study demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-α exposure impaired barrier function  <cit> . the renal epithelium has been shown to produce tnfα as well as other potent proinflammatory cytokines in response to external stressors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury  <cit> . tnfα mrna levels increased significantly thirty minutes after ischemia and inhibition of tnfα bioactivity decreases neutrophil infiltration and preserves renal function  <cit> . investigation of the proximal tubule llc-pk cell model shows that in order to produce a compromised epithelium the tnfα dose must elicit apoptosis  <cit> . the combination of tnfα and interferon-γ  exposure in model epithelial cell lines such as caco- <dig> cells  <cit>  and t <dig> cells  <cit>  results in loss of ter and increased paracellular permeability. finally, in a recent mdck cell study using a model of chronic exposure to tnfα for five days, claudin- <dig> expression eventually decreased and tight junctions were disrupted  <cit> .

mitogen-activated protein  kinases a family of serine-threonine kinases, have a fundamentally important roles as signal transducers. activation of map kinases by various growth factors and cytokines are important molecules involved in modulating cellular responses  <cit> . in terms of tight junction regulation the role of map kinase signaling has been of interest  <cit> . mapk kinase  overexpression led to epithelial dedifferentiation in mdck-c <dig> cells  <cit> . tight junction biogenesis was inhibited in mdck cells expressing constitutively active map kinase; pharmacological inhibition of mek <dig> signaling in these cells permitted tight junction formation  <cit> . pharmacological inhibition of mek, a ras effector known to phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinase  <dig> and  <dig> , attenuated dexamethasone-induced tight junction formation in the con <dig> mammary tumor cell line  <cit> . in these studies, the mitogenic effect of map kinase activity is logically opposed to tight junction formation. the analysis of the effects of external stimuli on tight junction regulation, specifically the activated signaling pathways, will provide valuable insight into tight junction regulation.

the goal of this present study was to characterize the response of mdck cells to the combination of tnfα/ifnγ. we hypothesized that tnfα/ifnγ would impair mdck cell tight junction function. we examined ter, paracellular flux, tight junction protein expression and localization in response to the proinflammatory cytokines. in a variety of disease states inflammation is thought to negatively impact epithelial barrier function, we report that tnfα/ifnγ co-administration to mdck cell monolayers impaired epithelial barrier function as measured by elevated paracellular flux and produced marked elevation in transepithelial electrical resistance . occludin, claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> protein expression was induced by tnfα/ifnγ exposure, whereas claudin- <dig> levels decreased; tight junction protein localization was modulated contributing to impaired tight junction function. inhibition of mek <dig> and p <dig> signaling during exposure to tnfα/ifnγ, abrogated these cytokine-induced effects in mdck cells.

RESULTS
effect of tnfα and ifnγ on cellular cytotoxicity
in order to determine whether tnfα/ifnγ induced cytotoxic effects in the mdck cell cultures, we determined the percentage of apoptotic cells in confluent mdck cultures using the tunel assay  and measured ldh enzyme activity  released from treated confluent cultures. no significant differences were found in percent of tunel positive cells following treatment for  <dig> hours with increasing doses of tnfα/ifnγ. as a positive control, cells were serum and glucose starved for  <dig> hours, and this resulted in a significant increase in tunel positive cells . the ldh activity assay revealed that exposing mdck cell cultures to increasing doses of tnfα/ifnγ for  <dig> hours produced an increase in ldh activity  that was significantly different from media alone controls at the two highest doses  <dig> * ±  <dig> %, and  <dig> * ±  <dig> %. examination of mdck cultures by phase-contrast microscopy indicates that even at the highest experimental doses of tnfα/ifnγ, cell monolayers are intact. using an established model of apoptosis and necrosis  <cit> , mdck cells were serum and glucose starved for  <dig> hours followed by addition of antimycin a  for the final  <dig> hours to deplete atp, this resulted in release of ldh that was significantly greater than the highest tnfα/ifnγ treatments .

depriving mdck cells of serum and glucose for  <dig> hours resulted in a significant increase in paracellular flux with a corresponding decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance , when deprived cells were depleted of atp, flux increased dramatically while ter values declined to levels near baseline. interestingly, when serum and glucose deprived cells were treated with tnfα/ifnγ  the ter values reversed and increased compared to starvation alone. collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the combination of these cytokines alters tight junction function independently from apoptotic or necrotic mechanisms.

effect of tnfα and ifnγ on transepithelial electrical resistance
analysis of transepithelial electrical resistance  in mdck cells provides a reliable method for estimation of tight junction integrity. confluent mdck cell cultures were exposed to either tnfα or ifnγ for  <dig> hours before ter was measured. exposure to tnfα induced a dose dependent elevation in ter , whereas exposure to ifnγ induced no significant effect on mdck cell ter.

a time-course was performed for up to  <dig> hours on confluent mdck cell cultures exposed to tnfα/ifnγ while ter was monitored at regular intervals. figure 3a represents the changes in ter under the following conditions media only control, tnfα/ifnγ, 3/ <dig> ng/ml, tnfα/ifnγ, 10/ <dig> ng/ml, and tnfα/ifnγ, 30/ <dig> ng/ml. in the first six hours of cytokine exposure ter values are relatively stable. between  <dig> and  <dig> hours, a significant dose-dependent elevation of ter is observed. mdck cells have  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Ω*cm <dig> of resistance, at  <dig> hours cells treated with 3/ <dig> ng/ml of tnfα/ifnγ developed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Ω*cm <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Ω*cm <dig> when treated with 30/ <dig> ng/ml of tnfα/ifnγ. this represents a 65% increase in ter at  <dig> hr in the presence of the highest concentration of cytokine. interestingly, between  <dig> and  <dig> hours there is a return toward baseline in mdck cells treated with the lower doses of cytokine, whereas cells treated with the highest dose show a 104% increase in ter. these studies imply that treatment with tnfα/ifnγ in mdck cells positively regulates factors that contribute to ter.

to investigate the contribution of the map kinase signaling pathway we employed several potent and specific pharmacological agents. mdck cell grown to confluence on transwell inserts were treated with tnfα/ifnγ  for  <dig> hr in the presence and absence of a panel of inhibitors , u <dig> , sb <dig>  and a sp <dig> . treatment with tnfα/ifnγ resulted in a 95% increase in ter compared to control cells, the addition of u <dig> to cells treated with cytokine resulted in a significant dose dependent decrease in ter . however, the treatment with sb <dig>  a p <dig> inhibitor produced a significant elevation of ter compared to cytokine alone, resulting in a dose dependent increase of 33% and 80%. the combination of low doses of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> inhibition in the presence of cytokine produced minimal effect on the cytokine-treated cells, due to their opposing action on ter. the addition of sp <dig>  a jnk inhibitor did lower ter values a modest 22% in the presence of cytokine. map kinase activation and signaling pathways differentially regulate ter in this model of cytokine exposure in mdck cells.

proinflammatory cytokines elevate flux
the effect of flux assay temperature in confluent mdck cell cultures was determined, cells were placed into one of two treatment groups for  <dig> hours; control or tnfα/ifnγ . the paracellular flux tracer 4-kd fitc-dextran  was added to the apical chamber and recovery was determined from the basolateral chamber at given intervals. we observed a modest six percent increase when the flux assay was performed at 37°c compared to 4°c using fitc-dextran. additionally, exposure to tnfα/ifnγ did not markedly alter transcellular permeability. we observed an eight percent increase in fitc-dextran flux at 37°c when compared to the 4°c group. the modest increase in fitc-dextran recovery due to elevated temperature was expected, however, was not significantly different from the 4°c treatment .

in order to examine the effect of dose of tnfα/ifnγ on epithelial barrier function confluent mdck cultures were treated for  <dig> hours then fluorescein flux was determined. fluorescein recovery was markedly elevated with increasing dose of tnfα/ifnγ . the lowest dose tested resulted in a two-fold elevation in flux, doses of tnfα/ifnγ  produced a dose dependent significant elevation in flux.

in figure 2b, we report the -mannitol flux using mdck cultures treated for  <dig> hours with either tnfα or ifnγ. -mannitol  was added to the apical chamber and recovery was measured in the basolateral chamber following a  <dig> minute incubation at 37°c. by in large mdck cell flux is resistant to effects of these cytokines when administered alone, only the highest dose of tnfα  produced a significant 40% elevation of paracellular flux compared to control. ifnγ alone had no detectable effect on mdck flux.

in figure 3b, we report the -mannitol flux using mdck cultures treated for  <dig> hours with tnfα/ifnγ. in control cells, approximately 2% of the -mannitol is recovered in the basolateral chamber following a  <dig> minute assay. mdck cells treated with tnfα/ifnγ  produce a two-fold increase in -mannitol flux permitting 4% of the label to enter the basolateral compartment. in this model of inflammatory stress using mdck cells, ter and flux appear not to be inversely related.

we investigated the effect of map kinase pathway inhibitors on paracellular flux using mdck cells exposed to tnfα/ifnγ  for  <dig> hr. following analysis of ter, -mannitol flux assays were performed and reported as percent of control . tnfα/ifnγ resulted in a 66% increase in flux compared to control cells, u <dig> significantly decreased flux , sb <dig> decreased flux dose-dependently , the combination of u <dig> and sb <dig> significantly lowered flux 60% back to control levels whereas sp <dig> did not significantly alter flux. in these experiments, inhibition of erk1/ <dig> and/or p <dig> signaling during tnfα/ifnγ exposure significantly protects mdck cell barrier function.

western blot analysis of tight junction- related proteins
to examine the causative factors related to elevated paracellular flux and decreased ter, selected tight junction gene products were examined by western blot. occludin, claudin- <dig>  claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> expression were examined in mdck cells in response to tnfα/ifnγ dose following a twenty-four hour exposure . in general, low dose of tnfα/ifnγ produces an initial elevation in tight junction protein expression with the exception of claudin-2; the intensity and patterns observed vary. in figure 5b, exposure to tnfα/ifnγ  for twenty-four hours induced a significant 37% ± 6% elevation in claudin- <dig> expression when compared to control as measured by densitometric analysis. the occludin expression pattern  is comparable to claudin- <dig>  however the magnitude of elevation is modest, only a 22% ±  <dig> % was observed at the lowest tnfα/ifnγ dose. claudin- <dig> levels decrease markedly in a dose-dependent manner to 45% ± 7% of control values. analysis of claudin- <dig>  indicated a slightly different expression pattern; we observed a modest but not significant increase with all doses of tnfα/ifnγ tested.

in order to examine dynamic changes in protein expression a differential detergent extraction procedure was employed using cytokine-treated mdck cells. representative immunoblots of occludin and claudin- <dig> are presented in figure 6a. the densitometric ratio of tx100-insoluble fraction to tx100-soluble fraction for occludin and claudin- <dig> was reported in figure 6b. tnfα/ifnγ  exposure for  <dig> hours resulted in decreased occludin and claudin- <dig> in the tx100-insoluble fraction. mdck cells pretreated with u <dig>  for  <dig> minutes prior to addition of tnfα/ifnγ showed a significant elevation of occludin and claudin- <dig> in the tx100-insoluble fraction, this finding is consistent with the improved barrier function in erk inhibited-tnfα/ifnγ-treated mdck cells. these data suggest that early map kinase signaling events following tnfα/ifnγ exposure lead to both physical and functional remodeling of key tight junction proteins.

tight junction localization studies
occludin, claudin- <dig>  claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> localization was examined using indirect immunofluorescence in mdck cells cultured on coverslips. cells were treated for  <dig> hours in the absence and presence of tnfα/ifnγ. in this study, differences in expression and localization were quantified by examining junctional fluorescent intensity in a deconvoluted z-stack comparing the highest intensity of staining to the adjacent intracellular location . occludin expression is robust and localized discreetly to the cell's periphery . examination of the effect of tnfα/ifnγ dose demonstrates an elevated occludin signal with a substantial increase detected at the cell-cell contact regions . analysis of occludin fluorescence intensity at the junction demonstrates a significant 55% increase in signal detected. claudin- <dig> staining is more dynamic than occludin but generally the signal is localized to the periphery . tnfα/ifnγ treatment produces a marked elevation of claudin- <dig> cytoplasmic staining; the addition of u <dig> restores claudin- <dig> localization to the periphery . claudin- <dig> staining is localized to the periphery , the tnfα/ifnγ exposure produced a significant decrease in junctional intensity , u <dig> produced little restoration of claudin- <dig> staining in the presence of tnfα/ifnγ. in contrast, claudin- <dig> staining  and j/i analysis demonstrated that exposure to tnfα/ifnγ has minimal effect on claudin- <dig> localization.

actin stress fiber analysis
actin staining was examined using texas-red phallodin in mdck cells following twenty-four hour exposure to the given treatments . in this study, perijunctional actin staining was analyzed in z-sections that corresponded to the apical region containing the most intense staining of a tight junction marker. perijunctional actin staining increased by more than a factor of two in the tnfα/ifnγ-treated group . actin staining was similar to the control group when tnfα/ifnγ was delivered in the presence of u <dig> 

discussion
epithelial cell layers play a critical role by separating physiologically distinct compartments within most major organ systems. the loss of tight junction barrier function by deleterious inflammatory mechanisms is an important problem in renal physiology due to the contribution of these structures to the maintenance of ionic and water balance. acute renal failure related to ischemic episodes profoundly impairs the renal epithelium. following ischemia-reperfusion injury, cytoskeletal disruption and loss of epithelial cell polarity contribute to back-leak of glomerular filtrate into the blood  <cit> . in a recent study following kidney transplant, decreased zo- <dig> staining was reported in response to postischemic injury  <cit> . importantly, leukocyte infiltration is likely to occur in chronic renal conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune disorders leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in this study, we employ an important renal cell model,  to examine the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on barrier function.

initially, we were interested in determining whether the proinflammatory treatment regiment was altering mdck barrier function as a cytotoxic effect. tnfα is a known activator of nf-κb, a transcription factor that promotes survival; in a recent report nf-κb activity was inhibited by exogenous expression of smad <dig> resulting in elevated apoptosis in mdck cells  <cit> . however, it was recently reported that tnfα  initiated caspase- <dig> cleaved parp that induced apoptosis in serum starved mdck cells  <cit> . in the present study, mdck cells were treated in media containing five percent fbs to minimize serum withdrawal responses, we report that the combination of cytokines used in this study did not significantly induce apoptosis. at the highest doses  of cytokine treatment there was a moderate elevation in ldh release, however this was less than a ten percent elevation in ldh levels compared to control. importantly, we report that paracellular flux increased in a graded fashion with increasing dose of tnfα/ifnγ. when renal epithelial cells are exposed to agents that produce necrosis and apoptosis investigators report a decrease in ter along with a subsequent increase in paracellular flux  <cit> , we confirmed this finding in the mdck system by using a combination of energy starvation and atp depletion. we find that exposure of mdck cells to tnfα/ifnγ results in a decrease in ionic permeability which is reported as increased ter values, in fact when mdck cells are serum and energy starved ionic permeability decreased in response to tnfα/ifnγ. these data suggest that the mdck cell response to tnfα/ifnγ is distinct from a cytotoxic insult. in support of this concept a recent study using the intestinal epithelial t <dig> cell line demonstrated that the combination of tnfα/ifnγ increases paracellular permeability in an apoptosis-independent manner  <cit> . therefore, although it is feasible to induce cell death in mdck cells by serum starvation and/or high doses of tnfα for an extended duration, we are confident that the perturbations reported in barrier function were conducted using conditions that would activate nf-κb minimizing induction of apoptotic events. these conditions appear to result in a reorganization of the mdck cell junctions with minimal loss of junctional proteins.

in the present study we have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of mek <dig> and p <dig> signaling in proinflammatory cytokine stimulated mdck cells functionally protects the barrier function. several studies indicate that mek <dig> signaling increases paracellular permeability, there exists some disparity in observed cellular responses. recently, a report demonstrated that inhibition of mek <dig> signaling did not influence expression of occludin or claudin- <dig> or affect tight junction function in several breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . also, a study using enteropathogenic escherichia coli, showed that erk1/ <dig> was activated in t <dig> cells, but did induce tight junction barrier disruption as measured by ter  <cit> . however, activation of mek <dig> signaling by h2o <dig> exposure in endothelial cells increased permeability and resulted in occludin disorganization  <cit> . similar effects were also observed in caco- <dig> and mdck cell lines  <cit> . in this present study, activation of the erk1/ <dig> pathway by tnfα/ifnγ treatment produced altered ionic permeability and dynamic changes in junctional protein expression and localization. additionally, we found that tnfα alone potently decreased mdck cell ionic permeability while having only minimal impact on paracellular flux. this suggests that the observed junctional responses occur independent of apoptotic or necrotic mechanisms that likely elevate paracellular flux.

decreased ionic permeability in response to tnfα or tnfα/ifnγ exposure coupled to the increased paracellular flux of non-charged solutes when cytokines were presented in combination is intriguing. we find that inhibition of erk1/ <dig> signaling increased ionic permeability toward control levels as expected but inhibition of p <dig> signaling further decreased ionic permeability levels above cytokine treatment alone. this suggests that activation of the p <dig> pathway is antagonizing erk1/2-mediated effects on elevated ter in tnfα/ifnγ-treated mdck cells. while the map kinase inhibitors produced divergent effects on cellular ionic permeability measurements both inhibitors protected against increase paracellular flux of non-charged solutes. several recent reports reveal that erk1/ <dig> activation in mdck ii cells results in increased ter. for instance, a recent study of cyclosporine a treated mdck cells produced elevated ter through a mapk pathway  <cit> . in another study of mdck ii cells, egf receptor activation resulted in increased ter with a concomitant decrease in claudin- <dig> expression  <cit> . in a recent study of mdck ii cells investigators demonstrate that these cells have endogenously low erk1/ <dig> activity that corresponds to high expression of claudin- <dig>  <cit> . erk1/ <dig> inhibition in all of these studies prevented elevation of ter in the mdck ii cell line. recently investigators have determined that claudin- <dig> forms cation-selective channels in the tight junction complex  <cit> , alteration in claudin- <dig> expression results in perturbations in ionic permeability. consistent with these studies we find a dose-dependent decrease in claudin- <dig> expression in mdck cells treated with tnfα/ifnγ, this loss of claudin- <dig> correlates to a substantial reduction in ionic permeability. elevation in ter was inhibited by treatment with the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor but not by inhibiting the p <dig> signaling pathway. these findings are consistent with the current literature demonstrating that claudin- <dig> levels are regulated following erk1/ <dig> activation in mdck cells and its expression level will influence recorded ter from mdck cultures.

the cellular tight junction response to proinflammatory cytokines is variable based on cell type and numerous physiological variables. measurable changes in tight junction protein expression or localization that are predicted to play a key role in maintaining barrier function are typically more unpredictable. we report a statistically significant elevation in the protein expression of claudin- <dig>  but not occludin or claudin- <dig>  following exposure to tnfα/ifnγ. however, occludin protein levels are slightly elevated in response to several doses of tnfα/ifnγ tested compared to control. in this study, we report a dose-dependent decrease in claudin- <dig> expression following exposure to tnfα/ifnγ. the heterogeneous response of tight junctional proteins to cytokine exposure may be due to junctional remodeling which may involve additional protein synthesis and altered turnover rates. in other studies, researchers have reported decreases, increases or no change in tight protein expression following challenge with proinflammatory mediator. for instance: tnfα increased permeability while decreasing zo- <dig> expression through increased nfκb signaling, in a study using caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . investigators report increased paracellular flux with a decrease in ter following tnfα/ifnγ exposure using a mouse cholangiocyte model; interestingly major structural changes to the tight junction proteins  were not detected  <cit> . finally, using t <dig> cells investigators find that inhibition of mek signaling impairs both basal and cytokine-induced tight junction formation demonstrating an increased claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> protein expression in response to the cytokine il- <dig>  <cit> . although it might be tractable to predict that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines would be correlated to decreased expression of tight junction proteins, our study is in agreement with other studies, finding moderate effects on expression.

in the present study's examination of tight junction protein localization, treatment with erk1/ <dig> inhibitor in the presence of tnfα/ifnγ enhanced occludin and claudin- <dig> expression at the junctional interface but did not significantly affect claudin- <dig> or claudin- <dig>  in the tnfα/ifnγ treatment group there appears to be increased cytoplasmic staining, possibly related to a lack of tethering related to cytoskeletal rearrangements. functionally, mdck cells pretreated with the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor exhibited no change in flux or ter compared to control cells even in the presence of tnfα/ifnγ. analysis of tight junction protein levels demonstrated that pretreatment with u <dig> in the presence of tnfα/ifnγ induces protein levels similar to control however, when the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor was added two hours following treatment with tnfα/ifnγ, we observed a similar magnitude of elevation in their expression, similar to tnfα/ifnγ alone. this suggests that early events in the cytokine response are activated and produce lasting effects on mdck cells.

the actin cytoskeleton maintains an intimate association with tight junctions through scaffolding proteins like zo- <dig>  a member of the maguk family  <cit> . a recent study using a glomerular epithelial cell model exposed to tnfα for twenty-four hours reports an approximate two-fold elevation in total actin content as determined by a dnase i inhibition assay  <cit> . this finding is consistent with our results based on perijunctional actin staining in mdck cells. we report a two-fold elevation of f-actin staining following exposure to tnfα/ifnγ. this increase was prevented by inhibition of erk1/ <dig> activation. it is also noteworthy that other researchers have identified functional relationship between mek activation and cytoskeletal organization. mek-dependent pathway leads to cytoskeleton disruption in ras-transformed fibroblasts  <cit> . additionally studies examining epithelial dedifferentiation show a loss of actin stress fibers  <cit> . mdck cells stimulated with hgf/sf produced actin cytoskeleton reorganization through the activation of map kinase, resulting in junctional rearrangement  <cit> . constitutively active raf- <dig> in a salivary epithelial cell model induced actin reorganization and disrupted tight junctions by downregulation of occludin  <cit> . the association between the cytoskeleton and the tight junction suggests a structural and functional relationship that provides a tractable model for understanding the regulation of barrier function.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that mdck tight junctions are functionally reorganized in response to tnfα/ifnγ exposure through the activation of erk1/ <dig>  we find the junction tightens by elevating the expression of occludin and claudin- <dig> in response to tnfα/ifnγ. additionally, decreased ionic permeability arises primarily through a significant loss of claudin- <dig> expression due to erk1/ <dig> activation. apoptotic and necrotic mechanisms in response to tnfα/ifnγ may contribute in part to the elevated paracellular flux. based on immunofluorescent findings, occludin and claudin- <dig> localization appear to be in transition perhaps due to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. activated erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> signaling pathways appear to be responsible in part for both the curative and disruptive patterns observed in this study.
