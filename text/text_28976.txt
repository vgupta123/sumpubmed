BACKGROUND
photodynamic therapy  combines a light-activated drug with non-thermal light to cause selective damage to the target tissue  <cit> . the major mechanism of action of pdt has been shown to be induction of oxidative stress  <cit> . it has also been shown that pdt-mediated oxidative stress induces a transient increase in the early response genes fos, jun, myc, and egr <dig>  <cit> , heat shock proteins   <cit> , as well as sod <dig>  luc7a, casp <dig>  and dusp <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, relevant information exists regarding specific gene expression patterns regulated by oxidative stress  <cit> . signaling pathways influenced by pdt have not been fully elucidated, although a number of studies have addressed this issue  <cit> . moreover, relatively little is known regarding global gene activity, particularly when oxidative stress becomes excessive, as is the case for pdt. both clonogenic survival of cells from tumors after in vivo pdt treatment  <cit>  and resistance to aminolevulinic acid -mediated pdt  <cit>  have been reported previously. intrinsic cell sensitivity to pdt has been proposed  <cit>  to be an important component in the mechanism that leads to tumor response following pdt treatment in vivo.

a better understanding of the mechanics of the destructive pdt could facilitate further the development of this therapy. oxidative stress evokes many intracellular events including apoptosis  <cit> . modulating the anti-apoptosis factors that are activated by survival signaling may improve efficacy of the therapy. under conditions where oxidative stress is the initiating stimulus for apoptosis, it is assumed to simply trigger cell death as a result of cumulative oxidative damage. however, accumulating evidence now suggests that reactive oxygen species  may act as signaling molecules for the initiation and execution of the apoptotic death program in many, if not all, current models of apoptotic cell death  <cit> . signaling by ros would not appear to be random, as previously assumed, but targeted at specific metabolic and signal transduction cellular components  <cit> .

here, we address the effects of a destructive/lethal pdt dose on the transcriptome by using transcriptional exon evidence oligo microarrays. this dose induces high levels of cytotoxicity and is expected to have significant impact on gene expression patterns. the expression alterations were observed by investigating both early responses, and responses post mobilization of major response pathways. we show that high levels of cellular cytotoxicity have a direct effect on cellular transcription levels and impair metabolic processes. alternative splicing represents a key event in the control of gene expression  <cit> . here, we tested to what extent mitochondrial damage caused by hal-pdt modulates alternative splicing in a global manner.

RESULTS
rationale for selection of experimental parameters
sensitizer
5-aminolevulinic acid , a precursor to porphyrins, is effective and widely used for pdt of a number of diseases  <cit> . however, a significant shortcoming of ala is its limited ability to cross certain biological barriers , probably due to its low lipid solubility. in contrast, ala esters are more lipophilic and pass more easily through biological membranes than ala itself. hexaminolevulinate  is a hexyl ester of ala with a higher lipophilicity. hal has been shown to be 50– <dig> times more efficient than ala at inducing cellular porphyrin formation with a high selectivity  <cit> , and has been approved by the european union for photodetection of bladder cancer. thus, hal is a promising compound for pdt therapy. on this basis, it is reasonable to assume that the mechanisms of action of ala and hal are comparable, and that gene expression profiles should be very similar. therefore, only hal was chosen for this study.

cell line
studies are now in progress to test the use of pdt for several types of pre-cancerous conditions and cancer, including cancers of the skin, cervix, bladder, prostate, bile duct, pancreas, stomach, brain, head and neck, as well as lymphoma. pdt using topically applied ala was first reported for the treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma  in  <dig>  since then, there have been several reports of its usefulness in treating this disease  <cit> . the role of pdt in ctcl to date has been in the treatment of individual patches, plaques, and tumors that have not responded to the other forms of skin directed therapy. while several pdt protocols have been evaluated, further studies remain in order to define the optimal use of pdt in treating patients with ctcl. moreover, the use of pdt for ex vivo purging of autologous bone marrow graft has been proposed  <cit> . high-dose chemotherapy supported by hematopoietic stem cells transplantation  presents an effective way to cure lymphoma/leukemia. although autologous hsct has several advantages over allogenous hsct, autografts may harbor residual occult malignant cells that can cause a tumor relapse after being reinfused to the patient. it is therefore desirable to remove the residual neoplastic cells from the autograft before being applied. the ability of malignant cells to selectively accumulate photosensitizers offers the possibility of using pdt in bone marrow purging. recently, a study of the purging effects of pdt in leukemic cells mixed with normal bone marrow mncs was published  <cit> .

here, we aimed to map general responses on gene expression after pdt therapy. therefore we employed the jurkat human t-cell leukemia cell line that previously has been used in multiple pdt-studies. the induction of apoptosis through translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor  <cit>  and caspase-3-like activation has been demonstrated for this cell line. also, other sensitizers in pdt therapy have been shown to induce apoptosis in jurkat cells  <cit> .

dose and time course
the aim of this study was to determine the gene expression state of the cell in response to pdt immediately prior to and post switching to the programmed cell death. here, we measured gene signatures that were likely to represent a combination of both protective and pro-apoptotic signals. the characterization of the transcriptome at early stages  was chosen to reveal the state of the cell prerequisites to the execution of the cell death program.

it has been previously demonstrated that the appearance of cytoplasmic mrna degradation products occur 4– <dig> h after induction of apoptosis, independent of the apoptotic signal and the cell line used  <cit> . the purity and integrity of the rna are critical for the overall success of rna-based analysis, including gene expression profiling. for this reasons, the late  time point was selected to provide an insight into the later stages of this process, but still retain a sufficient numbers of viable cells and rna integrity necessary for the technical execution of the analysis. in this study, the integrity of total rna was measured by microcapillary electrophoresis and the degree of degradation was determined . with the starting amount of cells kept equal across experiments, a time dependent decrease of the total amount of isolated total rna was obtained. no compromise in the integrity of the rna was observed. this indicates the effective removal of the dead cell fraction by the wash/centrifugation step, following degradation of leaked rna.

pdt is a cytotoxic therapy approach, where the dose in therapeutic settings is selected to kill 100% of the target cells. therefore, a lethal dose  relevant to therapeutic settings was chosen for the study. lethal and sub lethal doses have been employed in a number of reports that investigated the apoptotic pathways induced by pdt  <cit> . the cell survival after hal-pdt was determined to select the killing dose specific for the jurkat cell line. fig. 1a shows the decreased cell survival with increased light doses. approximately 90% of the cells were killed at  <dig> h post pdt with the light dose  <dig> mj/cm <dig>  while 96% of the cells treated with light alone and 98% of the cells treated with hal alone were still viable . the light dose of  <dig> mj/cm <dig> that corresponds to ld 75% at  <dig> h post hal-pdt was selected for microarray experiments. the viability of cells treated with ld 75% dose was measured at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after hal-pdt . there was no change in cell viability observed at  <dig> h, while the viable cell fraction was reduced to 70% and 30% at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post treatment.

overview of transcriptome changes
for gene expression analysis, jurkat cells were treated with hal-pdt, and total rna was harvested from triplicate samples of non-treated and treated cells at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after hal-pdt. gene expression levels in hal-pdt treated cells relative to non-treated cells were determined by oligo microarrays that contained a total of  <dig>  oligos targeting human genes. the venn diagram shows that  <dig> probes  exhibited significant changes   <dig> h after hal-pdt treatment . the number of significantly altered probes/genes was reduced to  <dig> probes  at  <dig> h post treatment, with a subsequent large increase at  <dig> h, with  <dig>  probes . the large number of genes with altered expression at the  <dig> h time point might reflect a high degree of disturbance in transcriptome within the pro-apoptotic cell. therefore these genes will be discussed separately as late response genes.

early responses
a total of  <dig> probes  were altered at early  response . of these  <dig> % were up-regulated, i.e.  <dig> probes at  <dig> h and  <dig> probes at  <dig> h , while a total of  <dig> probes were identified as down-regulated at early response . previously, we have reported on the stimulatory effects on the transcriptome using a related treatment modality, photochemical inhibition treatment   <cit> . pci is based on photosensitizers with photochemical properties similar to those utilized in pdt. however, a weaker dose  is generally used, as the aim is not primarily to cause general cell toxicity. interestingly, when the lethal pdt dose applied in the present study was compared to those induced by pci, several of the early altered genes were identified as up-regulated with both modalities, indicating that both moderate  and high level  of oxidative stress are likely to invoke similar modulatory pathways, albeit with very different effects at later time points.

of the total of  <dig> probes detected as altered at the two early time points,  <dig> probes  were identified as shared for both the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points in response to hal-pdt. among the early response genes, mostly genes encoding proteins involved in the regulation of transcription processes were induced, such as v-jun sarcoma virus  <dig> oncogene homolog  , jun b proto-oncogene , v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog b  , rna-binding region  containing  <dig> , sry -box  <dig> , tribbles homolog  <dig>  , kruppel-like factor  <dig> , zinc finger protein  <dig>  , activating transcription factor  <dig> , btg family, member  <dig> . while inhibitor of dna binding  <dig>  dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein  and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog   were down-regulated. consistent with gene expression data, the protein products of myc were found to be reduced, while jun had increased levels at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after hal-pdt . over-expression of atf <dig> was seen until  <dig> h following pdt, but the protein level appears to be decreased at  <dig> h, probably due to a short half-life  of atf proteins  <cit> . several genes belonging to gene ontology group of negative regulation of cell cycle were up-regulated, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b  , protein phosphatase  <dig>  regulatory  subunit 15a  and sestrin  <dig> . genes coding for proteins of apoptosis regulation were also found to be up-regulated, such as heat shock  <dig> kda protein 1b , tumor necrosis factor  , tribbles homolog  <dig>  , protein phosphatase  <dig>  regulatory  subunit 15a , nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells inhibitor, alpha .

histone related genes
of the  <dig> probes detected as early genes ,  <dig> genes were identified as involved in nucleosome assembly and belonged to the histone family of genes . interestingly, various subtypes of the linker histone, h <dig> , were affected to a high degree by hal-pdt. six different histone  <dig> subtypes/forms  and histone  <dig>  h <dig>  were also up-regulated . the complexing of histones with dna, and the resulting condensation of chromatin, protects mammalian cell dna from radiation-induced strand breakage  <cit> . recently, it was reported that the zntpps sensitizer, when bound to cyclodextrin hpbeta cd, as used in pdt, can induce dna breaks  <cit> . also, beta-carboline derivatives  were demonstrated to distribute within the nucleus and intercalate into dna, causing direct dna damage through photochemical reaction products in pdt  <cit> . previously, it was assumed that ala-mediated pdt might not induce a clear dna-damage response, probably due to the fact that hal-induced porphyrins are localized in the mitochondria and bio-membraneous structures. since singlet oxygen, the main cytotoxic agent produced by light-activated sensitizers, has a lifetime of less than  <dig>  μs, with a maximal diffusion of  <dig>  μm from the site of its production  <cit> , extra-nuclear components of the cells were originally expected to be the main targets of hal-pdt. however, it was subsequently demonstrated that light activation of porphyrins derived from exogenous ala produced dna oxidative damage in a dose dependent manner  <cit> . the induction of histone genes might indicate a complexing of histones with dna, with resulting condensation of chromatin to protect dna from hal-pdt caused by oxidative stress. the protective role of histones in chromatin condensation as a response to stress was recently challenged by konishi at el  <cit> , through the proposal of a novel mechanism for cells to sense a specific cellular stress with ignition of an apoptotic response to eliminate damage. a specific isoform of the linker histone, histone h <dig>  , has been found to translocate from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it induces the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, with subsequent apoptosis of the cell  <cit> . while all nuclear histone h <dig> forms are released into the cytoplasm in a p53-dependent manner after x-ray irradiation, only h <dig> , but not other h <dig> forms, induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria in a bak-dependent manner  <cit> . the hist1h1c form was among the early up-regulated histone genes we found responsive to hal-pdt. many other histone  <dig> forms were affected by hal-pdt, thus it is difficult to speculate if hist1h1c is directly responsible of the deadly effect of hal-pdt. a further pursuit of the effects of this isoform with respect to translocation and mechanism of action awaits future studies, as does a more detailed elucidation of the roles of various other histone members. the verification of three histone  <dig> genes  and one histone  <dig> gene showed good agreement between rt-pcr and microarrays .

metallothioneins
the family of metallothioneins was highly represented as differentially expressed  . metallothioneins  are a family of cysteine-rich proteins with high affinity for metals. mts are known as scavengers of free oxygen radicals  <cit> . it has been shown that mts may protect dna from cu-induced damage by free radicals through sequestering of copper, and thus prevents its participation in redox reactions  <cit> . previous studies have also revealed that mts can protect cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and metals  <cit> . since pdt-induced cellular damage is mainly due to free oxygen radicals  <cit> , significant over-expression of the mt genes may indicate a protective role from the hal-pdt-induced oxidative stress. this suggests that mts may play a role in regulating apoptosis, and that modulation of mt expression may provide a strategy for altering cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic compounds  <cit>  as well as pdt. the mt1b gene that was selected for verification showed good agreement between rt-pcr and arrays, while the expression of mt1g gene measured by arrays was somewhat lower than rt-pcr .

late responses
contrary to early responses, the number of altered genes/probes increased sharply to a total of  <dig>  probes  at  <dig> h, clearly displaying the massive disturbances in the transcriptome within the pro-apoptotic cells. the proportion of genes with up-regulated expression decreased to  <dig> % at  <dig> h, compared to  <dig> % of up-regulated genes at early response. since the destructive pdt dose likely causes high levels of oxidative stress, we cannot neglect that the high number of altered genes might likely indicate random transcriptome changes, caused by direct oxidation of non-specific mrnas  <cit> . rnas are reported to be more sensitive to photodynamic degradation than dna  <cit> , especially since most rnas are cytoplasmic and exposed to higher ros concentrations. in the case of rna molecules themselves are photooxidative targets, one could expect that the mrna transcripts would be damaged randomly and not bind to the specific probes on microarrays. as a result, the expression of genes will be measured as down regulated compare to untreated cells. to explore whether the observed rna down-regulation at  <dig> h was direct and non-specific, or targeted, we performed a gene ontology and kegg analysis. we observed that down-regulated genes contributed significantly in go enriched groups within the total of differentially expressed genes . while up-regulated genes scored in other go groups, a number of enriched extra-nuclear processes, especially mitochondrial, were present when down-regulated genes were scored. however, since hal, the mitochondrial localizing sensitizer was used in the study  <cit> , the direct effect on mitochondria was expected. furthermore, enriched go processes of up-regulated genes included both nuclear and extra-nuclear processes, such cytoskeleton, junctions and adhesion. notably, because of the direct pdt effect to cytoskeleton, well-known house keeping proteins such actin or tubulin that is widely used for the quantitation of western data would not be representative controls. thus, for western blots, the total protein content was used as a measure, by staining the gels after electrophoresis and signals normalized against total protein content. interestingly, genes encoded proteins in the porphyrin metabolism were stimulated, indicating cellular response to excessive porphyrin production after the transfection with hal, which is a heme precursor. among these genes,  <dig> different udp glucuronosyltransferase  <dig> and  <dig> family genes were induced. these are of major importance in heme degradation  <cit> . the gene ontology analysis suggested that the cell commitment to apoptosis was directly reflected in the transcriptome in a specific manner, and not random changes.

oxidative stress/mitochondria
a total of  <dig> probes  from genes relevant to mitochondrial function were identified as altered, of which  <dig> % were down-regulated. these genes encoded components of the mitochondrial envelope, the mitochondrial membrane, inter membrane, lumen and ribosome, as well as the proton-transporting atpase complex. the mitochondrial localization of ala or hal-induced protoporphyrin-ix  has been established  <cit> . the ultrastructural alterations of the mitochondria, in addition to higher percentages of cells losing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, was reported following ala-pdt  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes altered by hal-pdt were identified as being involved in oxidative phosphorylation . this gene ontology group was the group most significantly  enriched among all gene groups. a total of  <dig> genes from the atp synthesis coupled electron transport were found to be altered, the majority being down-regulated. this is consistent with previously published data, where atp levels were found to be decreased at both  <dig> and  <dig> h after ala-pdt  <cit> . furthermore, dysregulation of the citrate cycle  indicated that the cell energy balance was seriously damaged. surprisingly, a majority of the mitochondrial nuclear encoded genes were found to be down-regulated, while mitochondrial encoded genes  were found to be up-regulated at  <dig> h . mitochondria are the site of many essential biochemical reactions, an important subset of which requires proteins encoded in the mitochondrial dna . how transcription of mtdna is regulated in response to changing cellular demands is largely unknown. previously, it has been reported that release of mitochondrial components can trigger an apoptotic response. however, it was reported that atp depletion after mitochondrial photodamage does not play a role in initiation of the apoptotic program  <cit> . previously, we reported that at  <dig> h following hal-pdt nearly 80% of the cells exhibited typical apoptotic features and that pdt caused cytosolic translocation of cytochrome c and nuclear redistribution of apoptosis-inducing factor , followed by release of cytochrome c  <cit> . here, we report that a mitochondrial response occurs also at the transcriptional level by repressing and inducing mitochondrially encoded genes. we found various nadh dehydrogenases to be downregulated at  <dig> h. mitochondrially  encoded -cyb, mito-nd <dig> and mito-nd <dig> were verified by rt-pcr, and these were in agreement with array results . previously it has been reported that ala-based pdt initiate two apoptotic processes proceeding in parallel, one representing the mitochondrial pathway, the other involving disruption of calcium homeostasis and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated pathway  <cit> . in our study, the calcium binding proteins  had changed expression at  <dig> h post hal-pdt, confirming the disruption of calcium homeostasis.

the combination of the cellular responses  in addition to induction of mitochondrial encoded genes may indicate a partial repair of mitochondrial and other cellular functions. however, it is in general difficult to assess the impact of the changes in gene expression at  <dig> h, as cell mortality is the endpoint. one of the reasons could be damaged translational machinery, given that ribosomal proteins were identified as direct targets .

other pathways/genes
other gene ontology processes found to be very significantly affected included those of the ribosome, cell cycle genes, proteosome, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis , as well as protein transport, and er to golgi vesicle mediated transport . this indicated that main cellular processes, such as the cell cycle and protein synthesis/transport were disrupted, leading to protein degradation through ubiquitine mediated proteolysis. in addition, the processes such pyrimidine and purine metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, rna/dna metabolism, cellular protein metabolism, protein biosynthesis scored highly among enriched gene ontology groups indicating disruption of these processes. this seems to be an indication that the basic energy metabolism is shutting down, or at least is heavily affected, as one should expect from apoptotic cells.

effect on alternative splicing
in our experiments, we observed that hal-pdt resulted in expression changes in the spliceosome complex. a total of  <dig> probes  showed significant changes at  <dig> h , while expression of  <dig> genes were down-regulated . none of the splicing factors were significantly altered at early response time points. alternative splicing is tightly regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental-stage-specific manner  <cit> . since the microarrays included constitutive and alternative splice variant probes, we examined how many genes were alternatively spliced in response to hal-pdt . a total list of altered splice variants is presented . interestingly, of  <dig> genes with altered expression,  <dig> alternatively spliced variants were down-regulated already after  <dig> h. notably, we did not detect changes in the transcriptional level of splice factors at early response times. however, stress-induced signaling mechanisms that regulate pre-mrna splicing in vivo, by influencing the subcellular distribution of splicing factors, have been described  <cit> . this type of the regulation will not be detected by monitoring the transcription of splice factors. the increased proportion of down-regulated alternatively spliced variants remained similar  at  <dig> and  <dig> h, most likely signifying a dysfunction of the splicing machinery following treatment. furthermore, when the low fold changed variants  were taken into account, the percent of down-regulated splice variants increased to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post hal-pdt, respectively. in contrast, in the groups of the alternative splice variants altered by higher fold change , the proportion of up- and down-regulated genes were close to equal . this indicated nonrandom  changes in alternative splicing. thus, we used go to uncover whether the genes with alternatively spliced variants could be mapped to particular go groups/altered processes . interestingly, the go processes of altered alternative splice variants were relatively similar to the previously scored go groups, and included different metabolic processes, apoptosis, cell cycle as well as transcription. interestingly,  <dig> genes had up-regulated, and  <dig> had down-regulated alternative splice variants of the genes that had transcription factor activity. notably, alternative splicing of pre-mrnas encoding transcription factors is one of the common mechanisms for generating the complexity and diversity of gene regulation  <cit> . one of the genes was identified as activating transcription factor  <dig> , that had an induced alternative splice variant at all three studies time points, while the constitutive, full-length variant was low expressed and did not change with the treatment. atf <dig> is a member of the mammalian activation transcription factor/camp responsive element-binding  protein family of transcription factors  <cit> . atf <dig> plays a role in determining cell fate and has been shown to generate a variety of alternatively spliced isoforms in response to stress  <cit> . it was demonstrated that atf <dig>  isoform, but not full-length atf <dig>  sensitizes cells to apoptotic cell death, partly by suppressing the expression of the nf-kappab-dependent anti-apoptotic genes ciap <dig> and xiap. atf <dig>  has further been shown to bind directly to the p <dig> subunit of nf-kapab and down-regulate the cbp/p <dig> recruitment complex  <cit> . the sequence analysis of the detected alternative splice variant revealed that the alternative splice variant induced by hal-pdt was the atf <dig> isoform , demonstrating a direct cell fate control through alternative splicing in hal-pdt response. thus, the results stress the importance of alternative splice variant mapping. if not performed, this may lead to false interpretations of the results.

correspondence between alternative microarray platforms: cdna and oligo microarrays
molecular confirmation of microarray results is important when checking for consistencies of expression measurements using different methods. rt-pcr and western blotting were used for selected genes. recently, different microarray platforms have been reported to have a good agreement  <cit> . therefore, we included experiments on one of the time points  performed on cdna microarrays. in agreement with oligo microarrays, top ranking of the genes showed alteration in atf <dig>  cerbpb, jun, jund, ier <dig>  as well as metallothioneins and histone coding genes .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results provided new insights into how a pdt relevant dose alters gene expression. we confirmed known early defense response genes, and extended these to include the involvement also of other oxidative stress inducible gene groups, most notably the metallothioneins and histones. we also demonstrated that high levels of cellular cytotoxicity had direct effects on nuclear and mitochondrial dna transcription levels in impairing metabolic processes. furthermore, we attempted to identify how different signaling processes may be involved in the execution of cell death. the results indicated that mitochondrial damage caused by hal-pdt modulates alternative splicing through unbalancing a vast number of isoform equilibriums, which may be an important contribution to the deadly outcome of hal-pdt therapy.
