BACKGROUND
as an important source of high quality protein for human consumption, cattle are considered to be one of the most important domestic animals. at present, intensive production systems have aggravated the health issues in cattle, such as mastitis  <cit> , acidosis  <cit> , metritis  <cit> , as well as welfare issues which have been leading to increasing foodborne and zoonotic risks to humans and economic losses for the industry. due to the lack of validated early diagnosis procedures, most diseases and disorders are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, and treatments for these pathologies are often expensive and ineffective. therefore, there is an urgent need to identify reliable methods to diagnose the health status of cattle, which can then be used for early detection and monitoring disease progression.

accumulating evidences suggest that expression patterns of micrornas  in biofluids represent the in vivo status of many physiological changes and diseases , revealing that they can be served as diagnostic markers for multiple human diseases including cancers . blood is a non-invasive and the easiest obtained biofluid, and mirnas in blood hold great promise to discover biomarkers for a wide range of diseases and biological processes . whole blood was the most frequently used biofluid in detecting mirnas, but the outcomes could be biased due to the complexity of various cell types and components  <cit> . recently, the mirnas in body fluids, such as plasma, serum, urine, saliva and sputum  have been used as informative biomarkers to assess and monitor the body’s physiological and pathological status due to their stability even under extreme conditions in human  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that the circulating mirnas from plasma and serum could serve as potential biomarkers for livestock health and disease, such as mir- 26a for cattle early pregnancy  <cit> , mir-19a and mir-19b for cattle heat stress  <cit> , mir-29c and mir- <dig> for chicken puberty onset  <cit> , and mir- <dig> for pig cardiogenic shock  <cit> .

these free circulating mirnas can be protected from nucleases by various types of carriers  <cit> , such as exosomes. exosomes are the most studied carriers, which are small  and derived from the multivesicular body-sorting pathway . recent researches have proposed to use exosomal mirnas for diagnositic markers in human diseases  <cit> , since the mirnas in exosomes have specific function and higher variability than blood cells  <cit> . in addition, the quantity of mirnas in exosomes exhibited more difference between healthy individuals and cancer patients than that in sera  <cit> . however, the exosomal mirna profiling needs extra steps in rna extraction and which mirnas  are more representative for physiological and health changes in cattle have not been defined.

the next-generation sequencing has made it possible to obtain highly detailed information of mirnas on the types and abundance from various biomaterials  <cit> . however, consensus has not been reached with regard to the sample types used for isolation of total rna , especially in cattle. to date, there is little information on mirnaomes in bovine sera and exosomes, which could be potential diagnostic biomarkers relating to cattle health. therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare the bovine mirnaomes of sera and exosomes, and to provide insights into their future applications.

RESULTS
mirna profiles of sera and exosomes
an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng small rnas were obtained from sera and exosomes , respectively. rna sequencing resulted in  <dig> , <dig> reads for sera and  <dig> , <dig> reads for exosomes, respectively. after quality and length filter,  <dig> , <dig> reads  in sera and  <dig> , <dig> reads  in exosomes were used for further analysis . in exosomes, higher proportion of reads failed the size trimming compared to sera . after mapping to bovine genome , the proportion of annotated mirnas was  <dig>  % in sera, and  <dig>  % in exosomes . and the reads mapped to trna, rrna snorna and snrna were low   from both sera and exosomes with large proportion reads unidentified. size distribution of the reads between  <dig> and 40 nt revealed  <dig> peaks at 19–25 nt and 30–33 nt for both sample types .table  <dig> rna extraction from bovine sera and exosomes

complexity and specificity of sera and exosomes mirnaomes
the mirnas that were detected in at least two cattle with more than  <dig> reads per million total mapped reads  in sera or exosomes were considered as expressed mirnas. sera had higher number of mirnas  expressed, while significantly less mirnas  were expressed in exosomes . the respective mirnaomes of sera and exosomes are available in additional file 2: table s <dig>  using principle component analysis  it showed that the mirnas profiles between sera and exosomes were different . more uniquely expressed mirnas were found in sera than those in exosomes, with  <dig> and  <dig> uniquely expressed mirnas detected  in sera and exosomes, respectively .fig.  <dig> complexity of mirnas detected in the sera and exosomes. a average number of mirnas expressed in sera and exosomes, different letters  represent significant difference . b principle component analysis of the total detected mirnas in sera and exosomes . c venn diagram showing the profile of mirnas expressed in sera and exosomes. d correlation analysis of the commonly expressed mirnas in sera and exosomes

it was observed that  <dig> mirnas were commonly expressed in sera and exosomes , and their expression profiles had a high correlation of  <dig>  . from the commonly expressed mirnas, the proportion of the top  <dig> mirnas accounted  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of total reads for sera and exosomes, respectively, with the same predominant mirnas identified. the comparison of the relative abundance of top  <dig> annotated mirnas showed that sera and exosomes had similar profiles of abundant mirnas except mir- <dig> in sera and mir-10b in exosmes .fig.  <dig> the pie chart of ten most abundant mirnas. a sera. b exosomes. mirnas differed in two samples were colored in red



in addition,  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed  between sera and exosomes. the expression of mir- <dig>  mir-16a, mir-146b and mir-24-3p were higher in sera, while the expression of other eight mirnas  were higher in exosomes .table  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in sera and exosomes



experimental validation of mirna expression
a total of  <dig> uniquely expressed and de mirnas that identified from mirna-seq  were selected for validation using stem-loop rt-qpcr. three out of four de mirnas showed similar trend as detected by mirna-seq. specifically, the expressions of mir-146b and mir-24-3p were highly expressed in the sera, while mir- <dig> was highly expressed in the exosomes by mirna-seq and rt-qpcr  . although the expression of mir-21-3p, detected by rt-qpcr showed no significant difference between sera and exosomes , its expression was numerically higher in exosomes, which was similar with the results detected by mirna-seq . however, the expression of those sera or exosomes uniquely expressed mirnas could not be detected by rt-qpcr , which may be due to their low abundance and the relative low content of mirnas in serum.fig.  <dig> expression of selected de mirnas between sera and exosomes detected by rt-qpcr and mirna-seq. a expression of mir-146b; b expression of mir-24-3p; c expression of mir-328; d expression of mir-21-3p. mirna expression from rt-qpcr represented by lines on the top and values are shown on the right vertical axis as relative abundance. mirna expression from mirna-seq represented by bars on the bottom and values are shown on the left vertical axis as log2rpm . * on the top of lines or bars indicate significant  difference between sera and exosomes. data are presented as mean ± standard deviation



stability of the bovine sera and exosomes mirnaomes in healthy animals
it is important to determine how mirnaomes varies among individuals, especially for the healthy animals. as the sera and exosomes were taken from the same four cattle, the individual variation between sera and exosomes reflected the stability of mirnas in two types of samples. the high correlation was observed with r =  <dig>  for sera  and r =  <dig>  for exosomal mirnaomes  among four animals. the hierarchical clustering analysis on the  <dig> most variable mirnas revealed that sera and exosomes were clustered to different groups .fig.  <dig> heatmap generated by clustering of the  <dig> most variable mirnas in sera  and exosomes  from four cattle. colors represent different normalized sequencing reads number as indicated by the color bar 



functional categories and pathways of uniquely expressed and differentially expressed mirnas in sera and exosomes
based on predicted targets of mirnas using targetscan and mirranda as well as functional analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis , the functional categories of mirnaomes in sera and exosomes were identified. further functional analysis of uniquely expressed mirnas in sera and exosomes revealed  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene targets, respectively. among the top  <dig> functions of predicted gene targets of the uniquely expressed mirnas in sera and exosomes,  <dig> functional categories were common in two types of samples . besides the common functions, the sera uniquely expressed mirnas targeted the function of diseases and disorders such as neurological/infections diseases and skeletal, muscular, hereditary and psychological disorders, while the exosomes uniquely expressed mirnas packaged into exosomes targeted the function of tissue development and lipid metabolism .table  <dig> top  <dig> functional categories of predicted gene targets by uniquely expressed mirnas in sera and exosomes



there were  <dig>  genes putatively targeting by the  <dig> de mirnas. functional analysis revealed that most of the functional categories were shared by the highly expressed de mirnas in sera or exosomes . additionally, the function of infectious disease and cell-mediated immune response were targeted by sera enriched mirnas, while the skeletal/muscular system development and lipid metabolism were targeted by exosomes enriched mirnas. besides, the most targeted pathways predicted based on sera enriched mirnas were lps-stimulated mapk signaling, while the exosomes enriched mirnas targeted cancer pathways .table  <dig> top  <dig> functions of predicted gene targets of differentially expressed mirnas in sera and exosomes

discussion
to date, the searching of blood mirna biomarkers mainly focused on the altered expression levels of mirnas in diseases. however, little is known about their expression levels associated with the physiological changes and composition of mirnaome, especially in cattle. here, we conducted a comprehensive mirnaome comparison between cattle sera and exosomes that have been commonly used in mirna studies.

while surveying the profiles of cell-free small rnas in cattle, we observed that the annotated mirnas were low from the sequencing datasets. size distribution of the total reads revealed two peaks in sera and exosomes, which is similar as reported in the blood samples of mouse and human  <cit> . the nucleic acid fragments ranging 19–25 nt were mostly annotated as mirnas. it has been reported that, in addition to mirnas, several classes of small rnas mediated multiple biological functions, including sirnas , pirnas , and others that bound by argonaute proteins also could be detected in blood . moreover, studies on the processed small rnas, such as 5’ trna halves and and 5’ yrna fragments  suggested that they were abundant in circulating small rnas and might act as novel form of signaling molecules  <cit> . thus, it is postulated that the 30–33 nt peak in our study might be processed small rnas.

the mirnas detected in exosomes represented about 78 % of total mirnas expressed in sera, suggesting exosomes are the major carriers for mirnas in bovine sera. in particular, there were  <dig> mirnas expressed in all individuals with high correlation between sera and exosomes, indicating those mirnas may play important roles in extra-cellular blood fluid of cattle. mir- <dig>  mir-92a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> have been commonly applied as erythrocyte markers for human and mice  <cit> , and they were all expressed in our bovine sera and exosomes dataset with high proportion. besides, mir-22-3p, the secondly abundant mirna in sera  and exosomes , was mirna biomarker expressed by myeloid  <cit> . therefore, red blood cells and myeloid might contribute significantly to circulating mirnas and this could have important implications for circulating mirna biomarker studies. some of top abundance mirnas detected in bovine sera were not abundant ones in human  <cit> , vice versa, which were not found in bovine sera. the inconsistence in mirna spectrums might come from the different erythropoiesis between human and bovine  <cit> .

at present, little is known about the origin and destination of these sera/exosomes mirnas in the circulatory system. based on identified mirna profiles, our results showed that spectra of mirnaomes were different between sera and exosomes, and mirnaome of sera was more complex than that of exosomes. the complexity of sera mirnaomes is reasonable, because circulating mirnas were bounded to various carriers including exosomes, proteins, lipoprotein particles, and cell-derived extracellular vesicles  <cit> . for example, it has been reported that argonaute <dig> complexes carried a population of circulating mirnas independent of vesicles in human plasma  <cit> . it is noticeable that the sera mirnaomes detected in this study may also contain the exosome mirnas. to precisely identify sera specific mirnas, sera-depletion from exosomes using size-exclusion chromatography in the future studies will provide the detailed contribution and function of the different circulating mirnas components in sera. in addition, the unique origin may contribute to the mirnas patterns in sera and exosomes. the assumption above could be supported by the fact that  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were exclusively expressed with high level in sera and exosomes, respectively. in addition,  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed between two samples. because of their distinct profiles, mirnas from sera and exosomes might reflect different aspects of physiological and pathological conditions in cattle.

many mirnas are evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . therefore, information from human studies on the highly conserved mirnas that have important roles in regulating health may also be applied to cattle. for example, mir- <dig>  which was uniquely expressed in sera, has recently been reported to be involved in the antiviral immunity in human  <cit> . and antiviral interferon response could induce the expression of mir- <dig>  which then inhibited the gene expression and replication of hepatitis c virus  <cit> . mitogen activated protein kinases  are a group of signaling molecules that play important roles in the inflammatory processes . together with lps-stimulated mapk pathway that is the most enriched for up-regulated mirnas in sera, our results suggest that sera uniquely expressed mirnas  may play important roles in regulating inflammation and immune response in cattle. mir- <dig> is a brain specific mirna  <cit> , and we found that mir-9-3p and mir-9-5p was uniquely expressed in bovine sera and exosomes, respectively. the differential enrichment of mir-9-3p and mir-9-5p further demonstrated the specific function of sera and exosomes. in addition, mir-92b was differentially expressed between sera and exosomes, with higher expression in exosomes. nass et al. reported that mir-92b was specifically expressed in the heart and muscle, and overexpression of mir-92b reduced mef <dig> levels and caused muscle attachment defects  <cit> . in addition, mir-92b and mir- <dig> were over-expressed in developing brain and neuronal stem cells compared to the adult brain, and thus have been implicated as players in human nervous system development  <cit> . these suggest that exosomes uniquely expressed and/or highly expressed mirnas may be used as markers to study changes in development.

the high correlation of expression profiles among individuals was observed, demonstrating the low individual variation of mirnas in bovine extra-cellular blood fluid, the reasonable approach of sera/exosomes sample preparation and mirna profiling in this study. overall, the identified expression of mirnas in sera and exosomes enabled an insight into the basis mirnas pattern of healthy cattle, which provides a strong basis to inform the further investigation of circulating mirnaomes as biomarkers in cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
using rna-seq, our results revealed that 1) exosomes showed a less complex with respect to the mirnaomes as compared to sera; 2) sera and exosomes had their specificities in profiling of mirnas, which may reflect different aspects of physiological and pathological conditions in cattle; 3) exosomes were major mirnas carriers in cattle sera, and both samples could be used as potential candidates in biomarker study for different goals in future. nevertheless, this study laid a foundation for understanding the dysregulations diverging from ordinary physiology by providing information about mirnaomes of healthy individual of bovine sera and exosomes. furthermore, our results provide the guidance in selection of sample type for particular goals in cattle mirnas study. based on our preliminary findings, sera may be preferable for selecting biomarkers of heath such as disease, while exosomes may be better for monitoring the muscle development and lipid metabolism, which should be validated in the future studies using disease and production deficient animal models.
