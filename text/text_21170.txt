BACKGROUND
recent studies conducted in kenya show that a significant proportion of e. coli strains from clinical specimens exhibit a strong multi-drug resistance  phenotype
 <cit> . fortunately, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides remain effective against a significant proportion of clinical e. coli strains in kenya. however, recent studies have reported carriage of plasmid-borne aac-lb-cr and qnr genes among β-lactamase producers
 <cit> . the qnr genes confer resistance to quinolones, while aac-lb-cr confers reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. therefore, carbapenems remain some of the few alternative antimicrobials that are effective against strains harboring a combination of multiple β-lactamase  genes and genes conferring broad-spectrum resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. carbapenems may however not be readily available or affordable for many patients in sub-saharan africa
 <cit> .

in a recent study, we reported carriage of integrons, is elements, tn <dig> and tn <dig> in a collection of  <dig> e. coli strains obtained from hospitalised patients
 <cit> . these strains also harbored conjugatively transferrable plasmids conferring resistance to β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and co-trimoxazole among other antimicrobials suggesting that genes encoding resistance to these antimicrobials are physically linked to each other. carriage of physically linked elements, each containing a set of resistance genes, may increases the chances of en bloc horizontal transfer of multiple resistance determinants to susceptible strains. carriage of multiple resistance elements may in turn confer unique advantages to the host and enable them survive a strong antimicrobial selection pressure especially in hospital settings
 <cit> .

studies to determine the prevalence of resistance elements in a large collection of strains from sub-saharan africa are still lacking. furthermore, little is known on whether the genetic elements encountered among e. coli strains in this region are physically linked to each other. in this study, we determined the prevalence of integrons, isecp <dig>  iscr <dig>  is <dig> as well as transposons tn <dig> and tn <dig> in a collection of  <dig> e. coli strains obtained from inpatient and outpatient populations seeking treatment in kenyan hospitals during a 19-year period . we also determined genetic content of integrons and determined plasmid incompatibility groupings among strains exhibiting unique resistance phenotypes. physical linkages among these elements and to bla genes were investigated using pcr methods. similar analysis were done to determine if the aac-lb-cr and qnr genes are physically linked to these elements.

RESULTS
antimicrobial susceptibility profiles
at least 25% of the  <dig> isolates were resistant to expanded-spectrum β-lactams such as aztreonam , ceftriaxone , cefotaxime  and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid  combunation and to none-β-lactams such as streptomycin , nitrofurantoin , chloramphenicol , sulfamethoxazole , tetracyclines  and trimethoprim , table 
 <dig>  resistance to a combination of two β-lactamase inhibitors, amc and pipperacillin-tazobactam , was recorded in 22% of the isolates while 20% and 9% exhibited an esbl- or an ampc-like phenotype respectively, table 
 <dig>  a total of  <dig> strains were resistant to combinations of sul, trim, ciprofloxacin , cefepime , gentamicin , cefoxitin  and tzp. these isolates were therefore identified as strains with the highest potential to limit therapeutic option in clinical settings. imipenem , cefepime fep and cip were effective against ≥ 90% of isolates. strains from urine were more likely to exhibit an mdr phenotype compared to those from stool  or blood . similarly, mdr phenotypes were more common among strains from hospitalized patients than those from non-hospitalized patients .

esbl strains are susceptible to amc and cephamycins but resistant to various combinations of cephalosporins while isolates with an ampc-like phenotype are resistant to cephalosporins and cephamycins.

a: isolates were resistant to at least one aminoglycoside.

b: these antimicrobials are relatively cheap and are readily available in developing countries.

c: combinations of β-lactamase inhibitors that may be used to treat infections caused by strains that are resistant to β-lactams.

prevalence of integrons and integron cassettes
class  <dig> integrons were detected in 35% of all isolates,  <dig> isolates carried class  <dig> integrons but none tested positive for class  <dig> integrons. the dfra sub-types conferring resistance to trim and the aada-type cassettes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides were the most common cassettes in class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons, table 
 <dig>  the prevalence of cassettes encoding resistance to trimethoprim was: - dfra <dig> , dfra <dig> , dfa <dig> , dfra <dig>  and dfra <dig> , while that of aada cassettes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides was as follows: - aada <dig> , aada <dig> , and aada <dig> . despite a relatively high prevalence of resistance to β-lactams, only blaoxa- <dig> was identified as an integron cassette. while aada and dfra types were detected in strains exhibiting resistance to between  <dig> and  <dig> classes of antimicrobials, dfrb, aada <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  aac-lb-cr, and arr <dig> were detected only in strains resistant to at least  <dig> different classes of antimicrobials. majority  of dfra <dig> were detected in strains resistant to multiple generations of β-lactams.

the integron cassette arrays are indicated in the order they appear within class  <dig> and  <dig> integron variable cassette region .

the resistance phenotype associated with a given array is indicated in bold.

a: different antimicrobials tested in this study were conveniently grouped into  <dig> groups:- β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, and tetracyclines.

b: these integrons carried a sul <dig> gene at the 3’-end or lacked this gene or 3’-cs comprising the qaceΔ1-sul <dig> genes.

the cmla <dig> and aada1/dfra <dig> cassette arrays were only detected in integrons containing a 3’-cs. in contrast, at least 64% of aac-lb-cr, dfra12/aada1/blaoxa <dig> orf5/dfrb/orfa, and aacib/blaoxa-1/catb3/arr <dig> cassette arrays were detected in integrons lacking typical 3’-conserved sequences  that contains qaceΔ <dig> . all the three class  <dig> integrons contained an identical cassette array comprising dfra1-sat2-aada <dig> 

prevalence of tn <dig>  tn <dig> and is elements
the prevalence of tn <dig> was 22% while tn <dig> was detected in  <dig> isolates that also carried class  <dig> integrons. prevalence of isecp <dig>  iscr <dig> and is <dig> was 10%, 15%, and 7% respectively. a high proportion  of isolates containing the is elements and integrons were mdr , table 
 <dig>  isolates carrying multiple elements were more likely to exhibit an mdr phenotype than those lacking such elements  and isolates from urine were more likely to harbor multiple elements compared to those from blood  or those from stool . although integrons, is elements and tn <dig> were detected in isolates from all specimen-types, a high proportion  of these elements were detected among strains from urine of hospitalized patients.

carriage of genetic elements or combination of elements among strains exhibiting resistance to different antimicrobials tested in this study. the antimicrobials were grouped into  <dig> convenient groups:- β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, and tetracyclines.

physical linkage amongst genetic elements
figure 
 <dig> illustrates the strategy used for interrogation for physical linkages amongst genetic elements while figure 
 <dig> illustrates some of the genetic associations identified in this study. majority  of integrons containing 3’-cs were physically linked to the tn <dig> transposon while 75% of those containing a sul <dig> gene at the 3’-terminal were linked to is <dig>  this element was also linked to 80% of integrons lacking the 3’-cs, table 
 <dig>  forty  isolates contained class  <dig> integrons linked to a single is <dig> upstream the 5’-cs while in  <dig> isolates the integrons was flanked by two is <dig> elements. all iscr <dig> were detected only in mdr strains and were flanked by a pair of class  <dig> integron 3’-cs. close to 94% of tn <dig> that were linked to an integron contained a complete set of transposition genes  while 89% of tn <dig> with an incomplete set of these genes did not contain an integron, table 
 <dig>  all the three class  <dig> integrons were physically linked to tn <dig> 

carriage of tn <dig>  tn <dig> and is elements among strains carrying class  <dig> integrons. carriage of other genetic elements among strains carrying class  <dig> integrons is also shown.

pcr methods were used for screening for three genes that are crucial for transposition of tn <dig>  the tnpa encodes a tn21-like transposase, the tnpm encodes a putative transposition regulator. integrons are incorporated into the tn <dig> framework adjacent to the tnpm gene. the tnpr encodes a resolvase.

physical linkages between resistance genes and genetic elements
figure 
 <dig> illustrates selected examples of physical linkages between bla genes and different genetic elements. over 40% of isolates carrying blatem- <dig>  blashv- <dig> or blactx-m- <dig> were physically linked to the is <dig>  table 
 <dig>  the isecp <dig> was the most common is element associated with blactx-m- <dig> blactx-m− <dig> and blacmy- <dig>  one isolate contained a blactx-m- <dig> linked to this element. in all cases, the isecp <dig> was detected upstream the bla gene, figure

 <cit> .

thirty seven  of the  <dig> aac-lb-cr were borne on integrons containing the iscr <dig> while 55% were borne on integrons linked to the is <dig>  twenty four  of the  <dig> isolates carrying a qnra gene were resistant to nalidixic acid but not to ciprofloxacin while the other  <dig> isolates carrying this gene and  <dig> carrying the qnrb subtype were resistant to both antimicrobials, table 
 <dig>  none of the isolates tested positive for qnrs. majority  of qnr genes were physically linked to either integron-associated iscr <dig> or the is <dig>  all isolates carrying aac-lb-cr or the qnr genes contained multiple genetic elements and were all mdr.

table shows the number of isolates carrying the three quinolone resistance genes and the proportion of such strains in which these genes were physically linked to various genetic elements and to bla genes.

conjugative plasmids mediate en bloc transfer of multiple elements and resistance genes
multiple resistance genes and genetic elements associated with them were transferred en bloc to e. coli j <dig> in mating experiments, table 
 <dig>  majority of such transferred were mediated by plasmids containing i <dig>  l/m, xi, hi <dig> and the f-type replicons. these experiments further revealed that genes conferring resistance to tetracylines and chloramphenicol were also harbored in the same plasmids encoding resistance to β-lactams, quinolones and aminoglycosides. however, various gene combinations that had been determined to be physically linked using pcr could not be transferred in conjugation experiments using media containing different combinations of antimicrobials.

table shows carriage of genetic elements and selected genes conferring resistance to important classes of antimicrobials. the resistance phenotype and the genetic elements or genes transferred to the transconjugants are indicated in bold.

discussion
the current study shows that a significant proportion of clinical e. coli strains in kenyan are resistant to important classes of antimicrobials such as β-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. these results are in agreement with those published before
 <cit> . these mdr strains were however susceptible to carbapenems. it is easy  to purchase antimicrobials in kenya without prescriptions or with prescriptions not backed by laboratory investigations
 <cit> . we hypothesize that such practices may directly or indirectly lead to emergence of highly resistant strains.

a high prevalence of mdr strains from urine and all specimens from hospitalized patients may reflects a corresponding heavy use of antimicrobials among this category of patients as reported in past studies
 <cit> . majority of resistances encountered in hospital isolates were also encountered in community settings probably because patients are often discharged from hospitals as soon as their conditions improve, even before they complete their treatment regiments . it is therefore possible that hospital strains find their way into community settings and vis versa. however, we do not rule out the possibility that some mdr phenotypes may arise in community settings.

the high prevalence of class  <dig> integrons may partially be due to their association with the tn <dig> that contain a complete set of transposition genes. past studies show that dfra <dig> and dfra <dig> cassettes associated with tn21-borne integrons are the most prevalent dfra-subtypes in central, north and western africa
 <cit> . in this study however, the prevalence of dfra <dig> was much lower than that of dfra <dig>  dfra <dig> and dfa <dig> in that order. the class  <dig> integron dfra1/sat2/aada <dig> array reported in this study is globally distributed
 <cit> . our results may therefore reflect regional differences or similarities in distribution of integron cassette arrays. such differences may arise from unique antimicrobial-use patterns in different countries. this study also demonstrates an apparent correlation between carriage of dfra <dig> and resistance to multiple β-lactams as has been reported in tunisia
 <cit>  and from northern kenya among isolates from dog, cat and human specimens
 <cit> . the reasons behind these correlations are yet to be elucidated. carriage of different dfra sub-types in our isolates and carriage of multiple integron-associated sul genes  in the same isolate possibly correlates to heavy usage of sulfonamides and trimethoprim in kenya for treatment of different infections and as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections among people with hiv/aids
 <cit> .

some integrons, especially those lacking the 3’-cs and those containing a sul <dig> at the 3’-end, were linked to the is <dig> possibly because this element mediates deletion of 3’-cs in class  <dig> integrons 3’- terminal
 <cit> . similar results have been published in australia, spain and nigeria
 <cit> . our data further suggest that strains carrying is26-associated integrons are highly mdr probably because the is <dig> is also linked to other non-integron genes such as β-lactamases.

most β-lactamases, particularly those encoding ctx-m- <dig> and − <dig> and cmy- <dig>  were physically linked to isecp <dig>  similar reports have been published in tunisian
 <cit>  but no isecp <dig> was detected upstream the bla-ctx-m- <dig> among our isolates as reported in a related study from the same country
 <cit> . in one isolate, this element was found upstream the blactx-m- <dig>  reports of isecp1-blactx-m- <dig> linkages are rare but such linkages have been reported in klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in taiwan
 <cit> . majority of blatem genes, blatem- <dig> in particular, were physically linked to the is <dig> as reported in belgium and germany
 <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that most bla genes in our isolates are in similar genetic environments as those reported globally but the genetic environment of blactx-m- <dig> and blactx-m- <dig> in our isolates appears to be different from those reported globally.

our results further demonstrated that most bla genes are distantly linked to elements that are in turn linked to other resistance genes such as aac-lb-cr and qnr. similar reports have been published in tunisia
 <cit>  and in nigeria
 <cit> . isecp <dig>  is <dig> and iscr <dig> are known to mediate transposition and/or expression of multiple resistance genes in their close proximity
 <cit> . carriage of such multiple elements, each carrying a set of resistance genes may be responsible for the observed co-resistance to multiple antimicrobials among our isolates.

conjugation experiments confirmed that multiple elements were borne on narrow host-range plasmids such as incfii, inch <dig> or on broad host-range plasmids such as incl/m. the type of conjugative plasmids in our isolates  were shown to confer resistances similar to those in strains from tunisia,
 <cit>  and from two other studies conducted in kenya
 <cit> . we hypothesis that plasmids of different incompatibility groups have acquired similar or identical sets of resistance genes and this acquisition is mediated by genetic elements such as those investigated in this study. therefore, there is a possibility that such elements act as genetic shuttles between plasmids of different incompatibility grouping. the similarities and differences in genetic environments of bla, aac -lb-cr and qnr genes reported in this study may reflect a difference in transposition activities of such elements. we further hypothesize that differences in antibiotic use patterns in different regions influence the transposition activity of such elements.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports carriage of multiple genetic elements in mdr e. coli strains and their association with selected resistance genes. strains carrying such elements are likely to be well adapted to survive deleterious effects of combined antimicrobial therapy. furthermore, such mdr strains have a potential to increase morbidity and mortality among patients. it is therefore important to launch surveillance programs and to put up measures to curtail the spread of these highly resistant strains. there is also a need to compare the genomes of strains encountered in africa with those from other parts of the world.
