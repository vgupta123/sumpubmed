BACKGROUND
korean ginseng , a member of the araliaceae family, is a tetraploid plant  whose haploid genome equivalent is greater than  <dig>  gigabases  <cit> . ginseng is one of the most important medicinal crops, especially in east asia. triterpene saponins , the principle bioactive compounds in p. ginseng, are biosynthesized via the isoprenoid pathway  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> naturally occurring ginsenosides have been isolated from ginseng  <cit> . there are two main classes of ginsenosides , namely, the dammarane type and the oleanane type. due to these ginsenosides, ginseng is widely used in traditional medicine and has a variety of pharmacological and physiological effects on humans, including anti-cancer, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, radioprotective, antiamnestic, and anti-stress activity .

because of its commercial and medicinal importance, various genetic and genomic studies of p. ginseng have been performed  <cit> . in recent years, next generation sequencing  technologies have been used to develop markers  and to identify several candidate genes encoding putative enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis in p. ginseng . although ginsenosides are biosynthesized in most ginseng tissues, including leaves, and berries, roots have one of the highest contents of ginsenosides and have therefore been used as a main ingredient in traditional medicines for over  <dig>  years  <cit> . accordingly, ginseng roots have been the focus of intense research  <cit>  and have been increasingly produced throughout the world  <cit> . traditional sequencing was initially used to obtain root expressed sequence tags  of p. ginseng  <cit> . since the emergence of ngs techniques, more than  <dig>  ests have been deposited into the transcriptome shotgun assembly  database  <cit> . however, no studies investigating deep sequencing of the root transcriptome  have previously been reported.

in this study, we generated a huge collection of rna reads from different tissues and ages of p. ginseng roots using the illumina sequencing platform. we applied a novel approach to enable the unigene set to be utilized for efficient downstream analysis and reliable interpretation. we also performed comprehensive characterization of the root transcriptome and expression profiling of important transcripts such as those involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. the transcriptome data generated in this study provides new insights into the development of p. ginseng roots, as well as ginsenoside biosynthesis. overall, comprehensive transcriptome data from various root samples of p. ginseng will serve as a valuable resource for discovering new genes related to root development and major secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

RESULTS
de novo assembly of p. ginseng root rna reads
transcriptome sequencing of three independent biological samples of four root tissues yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw rna-seq reads from pair of  <dig> , <dig> reads . all raw sequencing reads were deposited into the sequencing read archive  of ncbi . after stringent quality checks and removal of adaptor sequences,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads with base quality scores greater than  <dig> were obtained . additionally, we included reported rna-seq data from chp adventitious roots  <cit>  for assembly to increase the coverage. initially, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were assembled using the trinity de novo assembler.table  <dig> summary of p. ginseng root transcriptome data acquired in this study




in most previous transcriptome studies in p. ginseng, other types of housekeeping and regulatory rnas were not eliminated from the assembled transcripts. however, initial de novo assembled unigene sets include other types of rna such as rrna, long-noncoding rna , and even sequences from microbial organisms, which make downstream analyses difficult. hence, we removed these unnecessary sequences, accounting for approximately  <dig> % of the initial transcript set, ultimately obtaining a total of  <dig>  contig sequences  for p. ginseng, with an average length of  <dig>  bp and a maximum length of  <dig>  bp . subsequent downstream analysis of sequences including isoforms would reduce the accuracy of biological interpretations. therefore, we generated an nr unigene set without isoforms for further downstream analysis using a new strategy . over  <dig> % of filtered transcripts aligned to ginseng genome scaffold sequences  <cit> , resulting in the identification of  <dig>  corresponding gene loci. the remaining  <dig> % of filtered transcripts did not align to the scaffold sequences and represented  <dig>  unique  trinity assembly components. finally, through selection of consensus exon sequences based on length, we obtained a total of  <dig>  transcripts comprising our nr unigene set , which was used for all subsequent analyses. the transcript length in the nr unigene set ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, with an average length of  <dig>  bp , and most transcripts were shorter than  <dig> kb . among the  <dig>  nr unigenes,  <dig>  transcripts matched  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  p. ginseng unigenes currently deposited in the tsa database . similarly,  <dig>  nr transcripts showed significant similarity to  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  reported p. ginseng ests in ncbi dbest . a total of  <dig>   transcripts were found to be novel sequences not previously generated or deposited into public databases for p. ginseng . furthermore, we estimated the ratio of full-length open read frame  sequences using transdecoder , with the encoded protein length set to a minimum of  <dig> amino acids and homology search with swiss-prot and pfam databases. in all,  <dig>  % of nr unigenes were likely to be protein-coding sequences, of which  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % full-length, 5′ partial were, and 3′ partial sequences, respectively. the remaining  <dig>  % of nr transcripts were truncated  or too short to predict their orfs.table  <dig> unigene set and functional annotation of p. ginseng root transcriptome



functional annotation of unigenes
to investigate the functions of the nr unigene set transcripts, we conducted a sequence similarity search against nr protein databases including ncbi, tair , swiss-prot, tomato , and potato  using blastx . the results indicate that  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of transcripts shared significant similarity with protein sequences in the ncbi nr, swiss-prot, and tair database, respectively . in addition,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of transcripts were also significantly similar to protein sequences in the tomato and potato database, respectively.

additionally, go terms were assigned to transcripts in the nr unigene set based on their sequence matches to known protein sequences in the ncbi nr database. a total of  <dig>   transcripts were assigned at least one go term, including  <dig>   with terms in the biological process category,  <dig>   in the molecular function category, and  <dig>   in the cellular component category. cellular component accounted for the majority of assigned go terms, followed by the biological process and molecular function categories. protein binding was the most abundant go term within the molecular function category . for the biological process category, response to salt stress and cadmium ion were the most highly represented terms . nucleus and plasma membrane were most abundant among various terms in the cellular component category. for further annotation, kegg orthology  categories were assigned to the transcripts. a total of  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to  <dig> pathways, most of which were found in metabolic pathways  and biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites .fig.  <dig> go annotation of root transcripts in p. ginseng. a total of  <dig>  transcripts in the nr unigene set were assigned to at least one go term in three categories, i.e., biological process, molecular function, and cellular component

expression profiling of unigenes
after the rna reads were mapped onto transcript sequences of the nr unigene set, transcript abundance  was determined by fpkm calculation. we investigated the  <dig>  most abundant transcripts in the four root samples . the most abundant transcripts in one-year-old whole roots were those encoding ribonuclease, sucrose synthase, beta-amylase, major latex-like protein, heat shock proteins, and peroxidase. in tissues of six-year-old roots, the most abundant transcripts showed similarity to transcripts encoding metallothionein protein , auxin-repressed protein , glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, major latex-like protein, phloem protein  <dig>  and heat shock protein.

investigation of differentially expressed transcripts among root samples
to investigate differentially expressed  transcripts among root samples, a statistical method using edger was applied. a total of  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed  among root samples . based on kegg pathway and go annotation, we determined that most de transcripts were related to starch and sucrose metabolism  as well as root hair elongation, response to abscisic acid stimulus, and golgi organization and biogenesis . furthermore, by comparing fpkm values among the four root samples, we determined that  <dig> transcripts were specifically expressed in a single root sample . among these,  <dig> transcripts were uniquely expressed in one-year-old roots, while seven were uniquely expressed in one of three tissues of six-year-old roots, including, one, one, and five uniquely expressed transcripts in the main root body, lateral roots, and rhizomes, respectively. go annotation revealed that most of these specific transcripts are involved in binding, such as atp binding, receptor binding, rna binding, and nucleotide binding, as well as transporter- and translation-related biological processes.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of differentially expressed transcripts among root samples. a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified to be differentially expressed among four root samples  using the edger bioconductor package based on individual fpkm values of three biological replicates for each root sample. heatmap shows the hierarchical clustering of average fpkm values obtained from individual fpkm values of three replicates. a indicates one-year-old whole roots, and b, c, and d represent main bodies, lateral roots, and rhizomes of six-year-old root samples, respectively

identification of candidate genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis
during ginsenoside biosynthesis, the precursor for terpenoid backbone production is oxidosqualene, which is biosynthesized via the mevalonate  and 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate  pathways  <cit> . based on kegg assignments, a total of  <dig> transcripts encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis via both the mva and mep pathways were identified . among these,  <dig> genes were present in multiple copies , which might have been derived from genome or gene duplication. we also identified candidates for major downstream genes such as those encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase , squalene epoxidase , and dammarenediol ii synthase . furthermore, two cyp <dig> genes encoding protopanaxadiol synthase  and protopanaxatriol synthase   <cit>  were found in our unigene set.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis in p. ginseng. enzymes functioning in each step of the mva and mep pathways are indicated by bold letters. the expression patterns of transcripts encoding these enzymes are shown in the heatmap, which was constructed using average fpkm values obtained from individual fpkm values of three replicates. a indicates one-year-old whole roots and b, c, and d represent main bodies, lateral roots, and rhizomes of six-year-old root samples, respectively. the number of transcripts identified is shown in parentheses to the left of heatmap. aact, acetyl coa acetyltransferase; beta-as, beta-amyrin synthase; cdp-mek, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; ds, dammarenediol ii synthase; dxr, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; fps, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; gps, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; hmbppr, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase; hmbpps, 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate synthase; hmgr, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymea reductase; hmgs, hydroxymethyl glutaryl coa synthase; idi, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase; mecdps, 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate synthase; mep-ct, 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; mk, mevalonate kinase; mvd, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase; pmk, phosphomevalonate kinase; ppds, protopanaxadiol synthase; ppts, protopanaxatriol synthase; se, squalene monooxygenase/epoxidase; ss, squalene synthase



most transcripts in this pathway were more highly expressed in one-year-old whole roots than in tissues of six-year-old roots, while some transcripts were more highly expressed in six-year-old root tissues, such as genes encoding se, beta-amyrine synthase , and protopanaxatriol synthase , which function in downstream steps of the ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway . in six-year-old roots, the transcripts were strongly expressed in rhizomes, followed by lateral roots and main root bodies. only transcripts encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymea reductase , phosphomevalonate kinase , and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  were highly expressed in main root bodies. overall, the expression tendency of the transcripts was similar between the upstream steps of the two pathways. transcripts encoding hmgr and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase  were also identified as de genes between one- and six-year-old main root bodies and rhizomes.

glycosylation, the last step in ginsenoside biosynthesis, is catalyzed by udp glycosyltransferase . ugts containing plant secondary product glycosyltransferase  motif sequences are involved in the glycosylation of plant secondary metabolites  <cit> . accordingly, we collected pspg motif-containing consensus ugt sequences from prosite  and searched against the nr unigene set using blastx. a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified in the nr unigene set. the abundance of these ugt transcripts was highly variable among the four root samples, and therefore represented strongly biased expression patterns . to identify strong candidate ugt transcripts that function in downstream steps of the ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway, we performed co-expression analysis of the  <dig> transcripts. however, we failed to detect ugt transcripts that were co-expressed with the  <dig> transcripts putatively involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis pathways.

discussion
comprehensive root transcriptome profiling in p. ginseng
p. ginseng is a highly therapeutic nutraceutical herbal plant containing ginsenosides with various pharmacological activities. among ginseng plant parts, roots are the primary tissue used for commercial production  <cit> . large-scale transcriptome sequencing allows us to investigate gene expression and to perform various functional genomic studies. rna-seq, an ngs methodology for rna profiling, is currently the best method for reconstructing the whole transcriptome and for profiling gene expression at unprecedented resolution  <cit> . rna-seq produces huge and complex data sets with some technical issues such as sequencing errors and biases due to amplification and fragmentation during various steps of the rna-seq protocol  <cit> . thus, deriving biologically meaningful findings from such a large, complex data set remains quite challenging. furthermore, it is not always possible to uniquely align short sequencing reads to a gene, as genomes contain numerous repeats and paralogous genes with high sequence similarity. therefore, in this study, we applied a computational pipeline to reduce the complexity and to enhance the biologically meaningful interpretation of our rna-seq data .

prior to this study, li et al.  <cit>  generated cdna libraries from four tissues  of ginseng, which are assumed to represent an updated set of unigenes for p. ginseng. although they were assembled from different tissues, over  <dig> % of those previously reported unigenes were present in our nr assembly set. furthermore, we identified a large number of novel transcripts, accounting for  <dig>  % of our nr unigene set. the results indicate that our transcriptome data include many p. ginseng genes beyond those reported in this plant species to date, even though our data were generated only from root tissues. these numerous novel transcripts provide exciting opportunities for further study of functional genomics in p. ginseng. we also functionally annotated over  <dig> % of the unigenes in our set, highlighting the accuracy of our approach and of our assembled unigene set. this annotation rate is much higher than those reported for other ginsengs, such as p. notoginseng and p. quinquefolius, as well as for previous p. ginseng transcriptome studies . while we assume that we obtained an almost complete gene set for root tissues, more comprehensive transcriptome data from various other tissues will be necessary to obtain a complete gene set for p. ginseng.

expression profiling of the root transcriptome
in previous ginseng transcriptome studies, the most abundant genes were related to ribonuclease, major latex-like protein, anti-oxidant enzymes, and sugar and energy metabolic pathways. such genes were also identified among the most abundant transcripts in the current study . in particular, transcripts encoding mt and drm <dig> were the most abundant in main root bodies, lateral roots, and rhizomes of six-year-old roots. the mt gene is also abundantly represented in four-year-old p. ginseng root  <cit>  and p. quinquefolius leaf est libraries  <cit> . mt primarily functions in metal homeostasis and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . additionally, mt genes are involved in root development and protection against reactive oxygen species  <cit> . similarly, auxin-repressed gene transcripts are abundant among in p. quinquefolius root ests  <cit> . auxin-repressed genes such as drm <dig> enable plants to respond to stress to enhance their survival, and they are also highly expressed in mature tissues  <cit> . since ginseng has a long life span, it is frequently exposed to unfavorable environments and various stresses. thus, our results imply that the abundance of mt and drm <dig> transcripts help protect the plant from various environmental stresses.

we identified a set of de transcripts among root samples using high throughput replicated sequence data. tani et al.  <cit>  reported that carbohydrates are the major components of one- to two-year-old roots compared to six-year-old roots. notably, we also detected genes involved in sugar metabolism as more highly expressed in one-year-old roots compared to six-year-old roots and rhizomes . rhomboid-like protein  is required for root growth and floral development, and it exhibits differential expression in specific tissues during different developmental stages in a. thaliana and other eukaryotes  <cit> . we found that the most highly expressed specific gene, pg_root111466_c0_seq <dig>  in one-year-old roots encodes rbl , suggesting that rbl plays a vital role in root development in one-year-old p. ginseng plants. similarly, the most highly expressed specific gene, pg_root120514_c0_seq <dig>  in six-year-old rhizomes encodes gibberellin-regulated protein , which is also encoded by a rhizome-specific gene in oryza longistaminata  <cit> .

genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis
chen et al.  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit>  sequenced the transcriptomes of 11-year-old and four-year-old roots of p. ginseng, respectively, revealing many genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. nonetheless, the β-as gene and mep pathway genes, which also contribute to ginsenoside biosynthesis  <cit> , have not previously been identified in the root transcriptome of p. ginseng. in this study, we identified candidate transcripts involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis, along with their expression profiles. the ginsenoside contents are highest in five- and six-year-old rhizomes, followed by lateral roots and the main root body . the gene expression patterns obtained in the current study are in good agreement with these phenomena . on the whole, the upstream ginsenoside pathway genes  exhibited higher expression in one-year-old roots, while the downstream genes exhibited higher expression in six-year-old roots. this result suggests that upstream genes are more active in one-year-old roots  compared to six-year-old roots. among the putative pathway genes, hmgr and dxs genes exhibited significant differential expression between roots and rhizomes. we identified three hmgr transcripts based on kegg annotation, one of which was more highly expressed in the main root body than in lateral roots, as observed by kim et al.  <cit> . previously, four candidate ugt genes were identified in p. quinquefolius  <cit> , all of which were identified among six unigenes in p. ginseng using homology searches  <cit> . recently,  <dig> ugt genes were identified and characterized by khorolragchaa et al.  <cit>  from ests of p. ginseng. in the current study, we identified a set of ugt genes including previously identified unigenes in p. quinquefolius and p. ginseng.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides large-scale root transcriptome data for korean ginseng using a newly designed assembly method. this genetic resource will help provide new insights into the roles of genes in development and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in korean ginseng and other plant species.
