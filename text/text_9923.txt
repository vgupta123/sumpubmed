BACKGROUND
the advent of next generation sequencing  technologies, coupled with reduced representation genome sequencing strategies, such as genotyping by sequencing , can generate vast quantities of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers in minor crop species lacking extensive genomic resources  <cit> . snps, the most common type of polymorphism in the genome, allow the construction of high-density linkage maps and concomitant identification of molecular markers tightly linked to complex traits of interest, known as quantitative trait loci . since the introduction of linkage analysis by sturtevant  <cit> , researchers have improved and applied genetic mapping techniques in numerous commercially important species  <cit> . traditionally, low-throughput markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms  and simple sequence repeats  were the molecular markers of choice for developing linkage maps of biparental populations and to anchor, order and orientate contigs, scaffolds, superscaffolds, and pseudo-chromosomes into physical maps . currently, snps are becoming more important for genetic, genomic, and molecular breeding research because they can be generated efficiently using ngs methods  <cit> , and they are replacing rflp and ssr markers for both major and minor crops.

multiplexing techniques have been adapted for the gbs approaches to concurrently sequence multiple genotypes at many specific dna sites across the genome . the multiplexing gbs pipeline developed by elshire et al.  <cit>  has been successfully used to produce large snp data sets for several species  with or without reference genomes for the creation of high density linkage maps  <cit> . in addition, deeper sequencing and imputation methods are being developed to solve sequencing errors of ngs data, which cause difficulties during de novo snp calling when reference genomes are unavailable  <cit> .

besides allowing the construction of high density genetic maps, ngs technologies enable the implementation of qtl detection strategies with a higher density of markers, allowing for a more accurate detection of linked loci. in the past, most researchers performing qtl studies have operated under the assumption that the genome cannot be fully covered with markers, and therefore, have relied on a relatively small number of markers per linkage group to detect marker-trait associations using interval and composite interval qtl mapping  <cit> . in addition to providing a large number of markers that can be applied to traditional qtl methods, large snp datasets allow researchers to characterize complex population structures, linkage disequilibrium , and segregation distortion and to perform genome-wide association studies  . gbs currently provides a cost-efficient, high-throughput method with enough power to develop saturated linkage maps in biparental populations for qtl-mapping studies in almost any plant species. as a result, high density snp linkage maps have been constructed for several minor crop and fruit crops species such as pear  <cit>  and raspberry  <cit> . more recently, gwas studies are being initiated and conducted based on snps in model fruit crops such as grape and apple  <cit> . both qtl and gwas approaches could be especially useful in woody perennial fruit crop species where breeding and selection is impeded by the long generation interval, biennial bearing, adaptation to all seasons, etc., resulting in a long-term process requiring much field space, expensive and complex infrastructure, and intensive cultural management .

the vaccinium genus, in the ericaceae family, comprises more than  <dig> genera of perennial flowering plants and  <dig> species commonly adapted to poor and acidic soils or epiphytic environments. several vaccinium species such as cranberries , blueberries , and lingonberries  are specialty crops of economic importance . nevertheless, vaccinium species have been understudied and their molecular and genomic characterization has been minimal until the recent advent of ngs technology  <cit> . advances in cranberry genetics have been comparatively slow among fruit crops such as apple, peaches or blueberries, principally due to its recent domestication in the mid-1800s, the lack of private and publically funded research, and the slow selection progress inherent to woody perennial species . in addition, cranberry breeding methods have relied solely on phenotypic selection with restricted experimental designs and limited genetic information or molecular genetic resources. recently, ngs has been applied to generate a cranberry draft nuclear genome assembly and reference transcriptome  <cit> , complete chloroplast  <cit>  and mitochondrial  <cit>  genomes, and moderate density linkage maps containing ssr, rflp, and scar markers  <cit> . the continued development of molecular tools such as high density linkage maps could increase cranberry selection efficiency and accuracy, especially for qtl introgressed from valuable wild germplasm resources  <cit> . furthermore, ngs-based snps will enable gwas and genomic selection in cranberry and other minor crop species using strategies currently being successfully employed in commodity crops such as maize, wheat, and soybeans  <cit>  and model fruit crops such as apple and grape  <cit> .

the current study was initiated to generate a large snp dataset using gbs in order to: 1) develop a saturated cranberry linkage map, 2) characterize genome-wide recombination, linkage disequilibrium, and segregation distortion, 3) anchor available cranberry genomic scaffolds and putative coding dna sequences   <cit>  for candidate gene discovery, and 4) conduct an initial assessment of synteny between cranberry and other species. gbs was performed using multiplexed illumina hiseq sequencing based on elshire et al.  <cit>  and missing data was imputed using linear discriminant analysis  imputation methodology based on singular value decomposition  <cit>  in a segregating biparental population  consisting of  <dig> progeny derived from a cross between  <dig> and gh1x <dig> .

RESULTS
genotyping by sequencing
ecot <dig> digested dna from cranberry parental plants  and progeny  were sequenced yielding  <dig> , <dig>  total reads and  <dig> , <dig> tags after merging. p <dig> accounted for  <dig> , <dig> reads, whereas p <dig> accounted for  <dig> , <dig> reads, each of the  <dig> siblings accounted for  <dig> , <dig> reads on average. the samples were divided into four 96-well plates, and a linear model of the form y = xβ + ε found significant differences between the number of reads per plate and per column, mainly due to variation in initial dna concentrations and quality of the sample. a similar model was fitted to detect differences in missing data due to library preparation  and samples .

snp filtering, imputation, and segregation
after filtering to remove sequence tags with high levels of missing data  and sequencing errors,  <dig>  putative biallelic snps were detected in the cranberry mapping population. r scripts were used to further reduce the number of snps to  <dig>  by excluding loci with a minor allele frequency  <  <dig>   <cit> . to maximize the amount of snps and genotypic data available for linkage mapping, median, principal components and linear discriminant imputation methods were tested to impute missing snp values. extensive simulations were performed for all methods to find the number of linear discriminants  and principle components  providing the lowest classification error. linear discrimination analysis  imputation, which has been accepted and used as an accurate imputation method , yielded the lowest classification error between the methods tested in the snp dataset by using  <dig> lds . following imputation, highly distorted loci  resulting from sequencing errors and/or other unknown biological mechanisms were discarded prior to map construction and only loci with mild levels of distortion p-values >  <dig>  were included. therefore,  <dig>  segregating snps were selected for further analysis in addition to  <dig> ssr markers previously reported by schlautman et al.  <cit> . of these markers,  <dig> markers were heterozygous in the parental configuration abxaa ,  <dig> markers in the configuration aaxab ,  <dig> were heterozygous in the configuration abxab  and  <dig> markers of configuration abxcd . loci were further separated into  <dig> sets of uniparental configurations  to create parental bin maps.

recombination estimation and linkage mapping
using the parental configurations, parental bin maps were generated using the minimum spanning tree  algorithm implemented in asmap  <cit> , and final distances were obtained providing those fixed orders to joinmap using the regression procedure  <cit> . linkage groups  were determined with a lod threshold > <dig>  the kosambi mapping function was used to calculate genetic distances between loci. the asmap package in r  <cit>  was used to obtain the order of loci and recombination matrices for the parental maps were calculated for graphical assessment of the mst ordering algorithm , additional markers were discarded due to high number of genotyping errors or high number of double recombination events.fig.  <dig> cranberry parental linkage map genome-wide recombination frequency and linkage disequilibrium patterns. ordered markers in  <dig>  and gh1x <dig>  parental bin maps for the  <dig> linkage groups containing  <dig> and  <dig> molecular markers , comprising  <dig> and  <dig> bins respectively, were used to show the computed parsimonious order of the map. the upper triangular region of the matrix  shows the linkage disequilibrium  whereas the lower triangular shows the recombination between markers 



the final parental bin maps for p <dig> and p <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> uniparental markers corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> bins, respectively . the p <dig> bin map spanned a total of 1321 cm with a maximum and minimum lg length of  <dig>   and 74 cm , an average lg length of  <dig>  cm, and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the p <dig> bin map spanned a total of 1137 cm, with a maximum and minimum lg length of 123 cm  and 78 cm , an average length of  <dig>  cm, and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm . the average, minimum and maximum number of recombination events per lg for the p <dig> bin map were μ =  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , and for the p <dig> bin map were μ =  <dig>   <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively .table  <dig> features of the cranberry integrated  and parental bin linkage maps

ssr homology and map comparisons
in order to construct an integrated map, a dataset containing uniparental and double heterozygote markers  was used and parental maps were constructed forcing the order found in the parental bin maps. the position of double heterozygote markers did not change across parental maps . finally, parental maps including double heterozygote markers were merged in an integrated map using joinmap  <dig> ® . a total of  <dig> polymorphic previously mapped ssrs with normal segregation were positioned in the integrated map and  <dig> and  <dig> in each of the parental maps . comparison of ssr marker order in the schlautman et al.  <cit>  and the snp-ssr integrated linkage map revealed consistent collinearity and validated the snp positions and lg structure of the current high density cranberry linkage map . the total integrated map spanned 1112 cm in length and contained  <dig> markers with  <dig> unique marker positions; the largest lg spanning over  <dig>  cm  and the shortest spanning  <dig>  cm  .fig.  <dig> cranberry ssr and snp map homology. homology between the ssr map  developed by schlautman et al.  <cit>  and the snp-ssr map  depicted by black dotted lines showing the accuracy of locus ordering using the mst and ml algorithms comprising  <dig> markers



genome-wide segregation distortion and linkage disequilibrium
the overall number of distorted markers is presented in table  <dig>  of the markers positioned in the integrated map,  <dig>  % displayed some degree of segregation distortion  according to χ <dig> tests with  <dig>   <dig> and 3° of freedom for the backcross , f <dig>  and f <dig>  type markers, respectively . the distortion favored the homozygote configuration for the p <dig>  and no specific allelic configuration was favored in p <dig> , but heterozygote configurations were more common in p <dig>  than in p <dig>  to assess linkage disequilibrium in cranberry, only markers positioned in the parental bin maps and segregating in the uniparental aaxab and abxaa fashion with a unique segregation pattern were analyzed. marker genotypes were transformed to 0: <dig> and 1: <dig> format, and were sorted by map position. ld across the  <dig> lgs appeared to be consistent in both the p <dig> and p <dig> parental backgrounds, and the observed patterns of ld among and between loci corroborated the marker order computed by asmap and joinmap . in addition, the average, minimum, and maximum ld decay across the cranberry genome  were computed for both parental bin maps , which considering a decay at r2 =  <dig>  were  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   cm, respectively for p <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   cm for p <dig>  the estimated equivalence of kb per cm was ~ <dig> kb/cm, which indicates that ld in this biparental cranberry population can extend up to  <dig>  mb.fig.  <dig> cranberry linkage map marker density/depth and genome-wide patterns of segregation distortion. segregation distortion is plotted as a function of chi-squared value  for monogenic marker segregation ratios against marker position on each of the twelve lgs of the integrated map. uniparental markers for p <dig>  are indicated with pink, uniparental markers for p <dig>  are displayed in light blue, whereas biparental markers  are shown in gold dots. dots with red halo indicate markers with chi-squared values significant at p-values ≤  <dig> . genetic distances are displayed in cm on the x axis. md label on the y axis refers to marker density across the linkage group



scaffold anchoring
the  <dig> markers positioned in the high density linkage map comprised  <dig> scaffolds from the cranberry nuclear assembly, representing ~13 mb  or  <dig>  % of the total expected genome length   <cit> . approximately,  <dig> previously identified and annotated predicted coding dna sequences  were contained within the  <dig> scaffolds anchored  <cit>  . pseudo-molecules representing the  <dig> lgs were created by arranging the  <dig> scaffolds according to their locus position in the integrated map in an attempt to anchor portions of the cranberry nuclear genome . lg <dig> anchored the largest number of genomic sequence data , while lg <dig> anchored the lowest number of nucleotides . similarly, lg <dig> anchored the largest number of cds , while lg <dig> anchored the lowest number of cds . scaffolds anchored were not oriented.

initial synteny analysis with other fruit crop genomes
local blast of  <dig> cds anchored in the cranberry genome identified  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> homologous sequences in the kiwifruit, grape, and coffee genomes, respectively . by comparing the positions of the cds anchored in the cranberry genome against their physical location in the genomes of kiwifruit, grape, and coffee, several syntenic regions were identified . for example, a major syntenic region covering almost one half of the lg <dig> in cranberry and the whole chromosome  <dig> in kiwifruit was identified . in addition, the same region in lg <dig> in cranberry was syntenic with a portion of chromosome  <dig> of coffee. these and other microsyntenic regions identified among cranberry lgs with kiwifruit and coffee chromosomes resemble the close phylogenetic relationship among these species, specially between cranberry and kiwifruit which are both members of the ericales . grape is another species evolutionarily related to cranberry for which a robust genome assembly is available. several additional microsyntenic regions between the cranberry and grape were also identified . several microsyntenic blocks contained the same cds in all four species  suggesting conservation of certain genomic regions among multiple distantly related taxa. local blast of  <dig> cds anchored in the cranberry genome and the available blueberry  draft genome assembly  <cit>  containing  <dig>  scaffolds revealed  <dig> blueberry scaffolds potentially homologous. however, no microsyntenic regions could be identified due to the low level of assembly of the blueberry scaffolds and the lack of well-defined chromosomes . however, some blueberry scaffolds could be anchored into  <dig> pseudo-chromosomes under the assumption that few genomic rearrangements exist between blueberry and cranberry, which are both members of the vaccinium genus.fig.  <dig> synteny analysis. synteny blocks between cranberry and kiwifruit  and cranberry and grape . the  <dig> cranberry chromosomes are represented in different colors whereas chromosomes for the other species have dark gray color. the distribution of significant blast hits between cranberry  and the other species  are shown. ring b  shows the snp marker density in each cranberry lg. in order to visually explore syntenic blocks, the location of each homologous sequence between cranberry  and the reference species  was plotted in ring c. in this plot, different dot colors were used to differentiate chromosomes in the reference species; those hits that potentially could be syntenic blocks , show non-gray color. for example, a section of the lg  <dig> in cranberry  has homology to large portions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in kiwifruit 



discussion
ngs techniques allow the discovery of thousands of polymorphic markers useful for the construction of high density linkage maps in an understudied crops . we applied gbs approaches  <cit>  to allow the massive development of snps in cranberry similar to major crops such as maize, wheat, and soybeans  <cit>  and other model fruit crops such as apple and grape  <cit> . after optimization with several enzymes, we selected ecot <dig> to perform gbs, which yielded a conservative number of snp with high coverage during marker calling . additionally, we tested different imputation methods to diminish the problem of missing data . in our study, linear discriminant imputation possessed the lowest classification error using the first  <dig> lds  compared with median imputation  and principal components imputation   <cit> . we used the pseudo-testcross strategy which has been used to overcome outcross difficulties in perennial crop species and provide information of the parental backgrounds  <cit> . to solve the marker ordering challenge during map construction  <cit> , we found it especially useful to use the minimum spanning tree  algorithm implemented in asmap once identical markers were removed to create bin maps and identified genotyping errors reducing the complexity of data  <cit>  and the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in joinmap v <dig>  for outcrosses to fit maps based on orders found by the mst algorithm using all data  <cit> . despite some challenges due to the nature of cranberry, gbs technologies enabled us to build an integrated map with  <dig> markers with  <dig> unique marker positions comprising  <dig> and  <dig> parental bins. this map is the densest linkage map ever developed within the vaccinium genera and the entire ericaceae family. until recently, the development of a fully saturated cranberry map was an inconceivable achievement, and yet the current map was constructed at a fraction of the cost in time and economic resources than using traditional development methods based on aflp, est, or ssr markers  <cit> .

comparison of the current genetic map with previous cranberry maps
we genotyped a population of  <dig> individuals derived from the cross among two highly heterozygous cranberry individuals   <dig> x gh1x <dig>  the integrated linkage map was constructed using a total of  <dig> snp and  <dig> ssr biparental and uniparental markers . the twelve cranberry linkage groups constitute the expected chromosome number n = x =  <dig>  according to schlautman et al.  <cit>  and georgi et al.  <cit>  maps. the linkage map spanned 1112 cm, 5 % shorter and 26 % longer than the previous cranberry maps spanning 1177 cm and 880 cm, respectively  <cit> . the improvement and length increase in current cranberry linkage map developed here is due to the addition of a large number of markers , which permitted an increased coverage of the genome, particularly in telomeric regions  <cit>  . in fact, the addition of gbs-based snps resulted in a nearly 10-fold increase in marker coverage of the cranberry genome from the  <dig> previously mapped markers  <cit>  . additionally, the current mapping effort used a much larger population than either of the two previous mapping efforts with  <dig> genotypes used versus  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  mapping individuals, which resulted in a greater accuracy on the number of recombination events detected   <cit> . previously, decreased rates of recombination have been observed in the telomeric regions of some plant species, which may explain the lower density of markers in the snp map found in some lgs such as lg <dig> and lg <dig>  <cit> . thus, in addition to inherent differences between genetic backgrounds, the increased length of lgs observed in the current snp-ssr map and the schlautman et al.  <cit>  map compared to the first linkage map  <cit>  is likely due to the increment of power to detect recombination events by using a larger population coupled with higher marker density  <cit> .

the use of ssrs in the current map in addition to the snps allowed us to detect almost near perfect collinearity with the schlautman et al.  <cit>  ssr map. in total  <dig> out of  <dig> ssrs were included in the integrated map,  <dig> which have not been previously reported . based on a comparison of homologous ssr markers among the current map and the schlautman et al.  <cit>  map, a few markers were inverted or positioned in slightly different locations . some studies have found that local inversions and minor discrepancies in marker positions are not uncommon during map integration or consesus map development . distal end rearrangements of closely linked markers have been reported in many species  <cit> . additionally, marker collinearity or synteny inconsistencies could reflect the true genomic structure between mapping populations. in fact, such genomic rearragments may actually be more common than expected and could represent regions of evolutionary plasticity involving selection and random drift  <cit> . interestingly, we found lgs with blocks of inverted markers consistent with balanced rearrangements consistent with double-stranded breaks between parental maps   <cit> . for example, lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> in our study showed some inverted markers compared with previous map  <cit>  while the absence of a large portion of the maternal lg <dig> could be due to a previously reported cyclical translocation in cranberry  <cit>  .

comparison of current genetic map with a previous blueberry map
blueberry  is the closest relative of cranberry  and has the same basic chromosome number  and similar expected genome size  <cit> . current genetic mapping efforts in blueberry have yielded an interspecific diploid blueberry map  f <dig> x v. corymbosum consisting of  <dig> markers, mainly ssr  <cit> , spanning 1740 cm across  <dig> linkage groups. the blueberry map covered  <dig>  % of the blueberry genome and reconstructed its expected  <dig> chromosomes. similarly, we recovered the  <dig> cranberry linkage groups in 1112 cm in cranberry with an estimated coverage of  <dig>  % according to method  <dig> of chakravarti et al.  <cit>  . due to the lack of markers in common among blueberry and cranberry maps, an assessment of linkage group synteny and collinearity was not possible. since all  <dig> vaccinium species are closely related and have a basic chromosome number of  <dig>  they can potentially be used for interspecific breeding purposes. for example, artificial interspecific hybrids have been reported among v. macrocarpon × v. oxycoccos and v. macrocarpon × v. vitis-idaea, v. myrtillus × v. vitis-idaea, v. angustifolium × v. corymbosum × v. darrowii, v. darrowii x   <cit>  . future comparative genetic mapping efforts should focus on mapping and synteny comparisons among multiple species across the genus to characterize the genomic features of closely related species and provide a better understanding of the evolutionary history and breeding potential of vaccinium species.

cranberry saturated map in comparison with previous maps
the cranberry linkage map described herein was comparable to several high density maps developed recently with respect to the number of snp mapped, overall marker density and gap lengths . interestingly, however, in some cases, high-density gbs genetic maps such as the raspberry map have found extremely different numbers of snp per lg and numbers of snps assigned to each parental map  <cit> . a similar phenomena was found in rubber tree, where the genetic maps from two f <dig> progenies presented very different numbers of snp markers assigned to each lg  <cit> . in our study, we have found fairly consistent numbers of markers per lg in both parental and integrated maps except for lg <dig> from the p <dig> parental map, which contained only  <dig> unique markers. the lack of markers of the abxaa configuration might represent a signature of a previously reported cranberry cyclical translocation  <cit> . a decreased ability to detect recombinant gametes for lg <dig> would be expected due the translocation given lower recombination and lack of chromosome pairing in the region, which would translate into dramatically reduced number of abxaa type of markers in lg <dig>  <cit> . although no cytological or sequence evidence is available to support our hypothesis, the genomic scaffold sequences containing markers integrated in our linkage maps open the opportunity to design probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization  experiments targeting the chromosome regions flanking this possible translocation.

recombination
the average number of observed recombination events per gametic linkage was ~ <dig> for both parental bin maps p <dig> and p <dig> , which was expected for lgs with an average size of 100 cm. an average of  <dig>  to  <dig> recombination events per chromosome were detected in rubus, which is very similar to our findings  <cit> . recombination ‘cold spots’ were observed mainly in lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  especially in areas with few markers detected. given that fish experiments for cranberry are not available yet, the nature of the centromeres is not known , therefore, cold spots could correspond to telomeric and/or centromeric regions . we also observed an increased recombination rate in several maternal lgs , and this translated into some of the lgs in the maternal  linkage map being slightly longer than the lgs in the paternal map  due to the presence of higher recombination in the maternal bin map. higher recombination rates in the maternal cranberry bin map could be due to genomic structural variation between genetic backgrounds such as has been documented in rapeseed  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . our study is one more example that recombination rates can be sex-dependent as reported in olive, apple, and grape . interestingly, we found that length in cm and the number of recombination events were related to the extent of linkage disequilibrium in the parental maps .fig.  <dig> cranberry snp-ssr integrated linkage map with putative genes. genetic map in cm comprised  <dig> lgs,  <dig> markers, anchored  <dig> scaffolds and  <dig> cds. marker density is shown as intensity of gray within the lg bars, along with putative genes annotated in polashock et al.  displayed as colored squares 



linkage disequilibrium 
in addition to the characterization of the recombination frequency between markers in the parental maps, this is the first study reporting linkage disequilibrium  in a biparental population in cranberry. information regarding linkage disequilibrium  is widely available in model species with substantial genomic resources, but has yet to be described in most minor crops such as cranberry. a pseudo-testcross strategy recommended for outcrossing species was used to measure the ld as r <dig>  the square correlation coefficient between two loci . the ld patterns across all linkage groups were related to the calculated recombination frequencies. linkage disequilibrium decaying across 50 cm was calculated. ld was broken down  at ~32 cm in our cranberry population. given the expected genome size and the fact that the markers covered  <dig>  % of the genome, each cm in cranberry is equivalent to ~ <dig> kb, which means that the calculated cranberry extent of ld of 32 cm corresponds to ~ <dig>  mb. this long-distance ld is typical for a biparental population where loci are in full linkage disequilibrium . thus, as expected for a biparental population the ld decayed slowly. ld above  <dig>  and  <dig>  extended over 25 cm and 30 cm, respectively. the ld decay observed in our population is similar to biparental populations in other species  <cit> . however, it is known that other outcrossing species such as maize tend to have a short-distance ld when calculated using diversity panels or compendiums of rils  <cit> . future in depth analyses of genome-wide cranberry ld will necessitate association and diversity panels to provide more information about ld decay in this perennial, outcrossing species. such studies will reveal whether the different reproductive features of the species such as sexual reproduction by outcrossing, forced self-fertilization, and asexual propagation through stolons have played a role in the evolution of linkage disequilibrium in the species.

segregation distortion
segregation distortion has been previously reported in cranberry by georgi et al.  <cit>  and schlautman et al.  <cit>  and by rowland et al.  <cit>  in blueberry, but this is the first time that segregation distortion was analyzed at genome-wide level using a fully saturated linkage map in the vaccinium genus . in our study, genome-wide segregation distortion was not always randomly distributed across the  <dig> lgs . moreover, segregation distortion was observed in well-defined regions of the cranberry lgs, which in turn could have biological or evolutionary significance. for example, a preponderance of distorted markers were located in lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  . conversely, linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> possessed up to three to four times lower number of distorted markers than the rest of the lgs in the map,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  % distorted markers, respectively . additionally, the high density of markers used in our study enabled us to accurately characterize regions of segregation distortion across the genomes of the parental  bin maps. p <dig> map possessed over three times more distorted markers than the p <dig> map with markers positioned in lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> of the p <dig> map possessing the most elevated levels of distortion . the distortion favored the homozygote configuration for the p <dig>  and no specific allelic configuration was favored in p <dig> , but heterozygote configurations were more common in p <dig>  than in p <dig>  since p <dig> has an inbreeding coefficient of f =  <dig> , whereas, p <dig> is estimated to be f =  <dig> this finding was according with observations. for example, in a 3 cm region of lg <dig>   <dig> distorted markers were clustered all favoring heterozygote genotypes over the homozygote configuration, but opposite situations favoring the homozygote configuration were observed as well. segregation distortion in the parental and integrated maps may indicate lethal and sub-lethal genes that tend remain heterozygous as classical genetic studies have shown in raspberry  <cit> . additionally, it has been reported that inversions, e.g., paracentric inversions, result in genetically unbalanced gametes that carry deletions, insertions, reducing fertility and leading to segreation distortion. interestingly, lg <dig> , lg <dig>  and lg <dig>  in our study showed strong patterns of segregation distortion in areas of putative inversions based on our collinearity analyses between cranberry parental maps  <cit> . as the genomic structure of cranberry is revealed, candidate genes in the distortion areas will allow the study of the inheritance of these chromosome regions revealing the forces that shaped the genome.

synteny analysis
we used a ‘ben lear’ draft nuclear genome  <cit>  as reference for snp calling in order to anchor cranberry scaffolds and construct pseudo-chromosomes for vaccinium  <cit> . the integrated linkage map allowed us to anchor  <dig> scaffolds, about  <dig>  % of the current number of scaffolds available, covering 13 mb of the cranberry genome , but representing 5 % of the cds from the entire genome, and uniformly spread across the genome. this result reflects the high fragmentation of the current cranberry genome assembly and highlights the needs to improve the sequence contiguity. nevertheless, the linkage map presented here and the anchored scaffolds represent a foundation for future efforts to build a high-quality cranberry genome assembly  <cit> . we used the scaffolds to position the putative genes annotated by polashock et al.  <cit>  in these pseudo-molecules . synteny analysis with other marker technologies such as est-ssrs and aflps have been useful in other species using markers in the order of hundreds. with ngs technologies, initial synteny studies can be easily performed by using high density genetic maps, where thousands of genes can be positioned and compared to other related species  <cit> . the syntenic comparisons between the cranberry map against kiwifruit, coffee, and grape genomes provided initial syntenic comparisons with these species . by comparing the gene order of cranberry to kiwifruit, grape, and coffee, we found well-defined regions of synteny. syntenic blocks were found between all cranberry lgs and the three other genomes, showing different levels of genetic relationship with the three species analyzed, and with kiwifruit being the most similar based on the number and size of the syntenic regions.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of gbs methodologies allowed the identification of ~ <dig>  potential snp’s, from which ~ <dig> were used to construct the first saturated linkage map in cranberry. mapping methodologies and ordering algorithms for f <dig> crosses  were used to characterize the recombination frequency and build a linkage map. we created an integrated and parental bin maps  and characterized linkage disequilibrium  for the first time in cranberry. ld patterns were consistent with recombination frequencies in map and ld decayed at approximately 32 cm , as expected for biparental populations. we estimated that each cranberry cm is equivalent to ~ <dig> kb. we provide all the sequences and marker positions that can be used for the vaccinium community to perform fine mapping within a region of interest or as reference for comparative genomics with other species . based on our current map, it was possible to anchor a total of  <dig> scaffolds out of  <dig>  comprising only ~13 mb out of the 470 mb estimated for the cranberry genome. therefore, much deeper cranberry genome sequencing will be required in order to reduce the number of scaffolds to make the high density mapping strategy a feasible option for anchoring the genome into pseudo-molecules representing cranberry chromosomes. putative genes annotated during the previous genome sequencing efforts were positioned into the map and these genes were used to perform an initial comparative synteny analysis of cranberry with kiwifruit, grape and coffee providing a first insight into the cranberry homology with related species. in summary, we used gbs to rapidly and reliably generate substantial genomic information, which will serve as a starting point for qtl mapping studies in this cranberry mapping population.
