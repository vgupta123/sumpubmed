BACKGROUND
human pluripotent stem cells  including human embryonic stem cells  and human induced pluripotent stem cells  possess the potential to differentiate into all cell types of three germ layers, which raises new prospects for disease modeling, molecular mechanism finding and cell-replacement therapies of neurodegenerative diseases that have a very complex nature of pathogenesis involving both neurons and glial cells  <cit> . the major challenge is how to efficiently generate renewable neural progenitor cells , which can be further differentiated into neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes under different conditions, for the study of cell-autonomous or non-cell-autonomous effects on disease development and cell replacement therapy  <cit> . therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying npc commitment during neural differentiation will be of great importance.

it has been reported that multiple signaling pathways are involved in neural induction from hpscs. the retinoic acid  signaling pathway works synergistically with sonic hedgehog  and bone morphogenetic proteins  as well as fibroblast growth factors  signaling pathways to determine the extending and dorso-ventral patterning of neural tubes during early embryonic development  <cit> . ra is a critical morphogen for the generation of npcs  <cit> . in addition, specification of ectoderm into neural cells and epidermal cells is directed by wnt, bmp and fgf pathways  <cit> . blocking the bmp/smad signaling pathway with small molecules up-regulates the expression of neural transcription factors, such as sox <dig>  pax <dig> and nestin, and, therefore, facilitates npc generation from hpscs  <cit> . moreover, fgf <dig> can antagonize bmp signaling to stabilize neural identity during early neural specification  <cit> .

generally, neural differentiation of hpscs consists of two major processes: npc generation from hpscs and final neuronal or glial conversion from the npcs. epigenetic modifications of dna and histones play important roles in the transcriptional regulation of neural cell fate-specific genes  <cit> . among those epigenetic processes, histone deacetylases  participate in neural differentiation by modifying histone acetylation/deacetylation levels. it has been reported that hdac inhibitors  such as valproic acid , sodium butyrate  and trichostatin a  can promote neuronal differentiation of nscs/npcs isolated from adult mouse brain, while suppressing their differentiation into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes  <cit> . however, there is a somewhat controversial report showing that deletion of the histone acetyltransferase  cofactor transformation/transcription domain-associated protein  can improve the differentiation of npcs into neurons in mice  <cit> , implying that disruption of the hat recruitment can also enhance neuronal differentiation. thus, the mechanisms by which histone acetylation or deacetylation affects neural differentiation might be complicated. moreover, those studies mainly demonstrate that the process of neuron or glial cell specification from npcs, which is the latter process of neural differentiation, can be modulated by hdacs. however, the potential roles of hdacs in the early stage of neural differentiation in mediating hpsc differentiation towards npcs have yet to be determined.

here we report that suppression of hdacs remarkably enhances the generation of npcs. we find that hdaci, such as nab and mocetinostat , can promote neuroectodermal specification once the neural differentiation is initiated. furthermore, we document that hdac <dig> might negatively regulate npc commitment by forming a repressor complex with its cofactor smrt ; knocking down of hdac <dig> or smrt in hpscs exhibits similar effects on the generation of npcs. collectively, our studies uncover an important epigenetic mechanism of hdac <dig> modification in the differentiation of hpscs towards npcs, which may facilitate the establishment of an optimized strategy of npc generation from hpscs for basic science and application research.

RESULTS
hdaci promote the generation of npcs
the h <dig> hesc line used in our study was in an undifferentiated state. this cell line expressed pluripotent markers sox <dig> and oct <dig> but not npc markers nestin or pax <dig> . we initiated the neural induction of h <dig> by ra treatment, followed by neurosphere formation . we found that many cells died at the beginning of neurosphere formation. however, nearly 95% of cells derived from neurospheres were nestin and sox <dig> dual positive npcs at the end of this stage , suggesting that the cells which finally contributed to npc generation survived during the neurosphere formation. moreover, the npcs could spontaneously differentiate into neurons and glial cells in npc medium without bfgf . these results suggest that typical npcs with integrated differentiation potentials are generated using this strategy. therefore, we utilized this model of neural differentiation to study the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of hpscs towards npcs.figure  <dig>

it is reported that retinoic acid receptors  recruit hdacs to repress differentiation related genes  <cit> , indicating that histone deacetylation can regulate the ra signaling pathway. our results showed that transcripts of class i and class ii hdacs were increased once the differentiation was initiated and were kept at high levels in all stages, indicating that hdacs participate in the process of neural differentiation . to investigate whether hdacs play roles in npc generation, we suppressed histone deacetylation using several hdaci. of those, vpa  and nab  are pan-inhibitors of class i and class ii hdacs  <cit> . first, we treated h <dig> cells with nab and vpa at various concentrations for 24 hours to evaluate the toxicity of those hdaci. we found that most h <dig> cells changed their morphology and died when treated with nab at  <dig>  mm to 5 mm or with vpa at 1 mm to 5 mm . therefore, we chose  <dig>  mm of nab and  <dig>  mm of vpa for our study. we also applied tubastatin a  and pci- <dig>  at 5 μm, and mgcd at  <dig>  μm, the concentrations of which were shown to inhibit hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> or hdac1- <dig> without obvious cytotoxicity  <cit> .

we then treated h <dig> cells with those hdaci with optimal concentrations at the stage of ra induction. interestingly, we found that the number and size of the neurospheres were significantly increased upon vpa, nab or mgcd treatment. however, we did not observe significant changes in the pci- or tuba-treated cells compared to the untreated cells , suggesting that class i hdacs, especially hdac <dig>  hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  may play more important roles than other hdacs in npc generation.

as mgcd inhibited hdac <dig>  hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> in a dose-dependent manner, we then tested the effects of mgcd at different concentrations , showing that the neurospheres became larger as mgcd concentration increased and about 90% of the neurospheres were larger than 200 μm in diameter when mgcd was used at  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  μm .

to explore whether hdaci treatment affected the growth of neurospheres, we continuously treated the neurospheres with nab at the second stage in which the neurospheres were formed and grown . we observed that the neurospheres from 18-day-treatment cells  were comparable in size and number to those from 7-day-treatment cells . more than 70% of the neurospheres from both treatments were larger than 200 μm, while more than 40% of the neurospheres from control cells were smaller than 150 μm . moreover, the average diameters of neurospheres from 7d-nab and 18d-nab showed no significant difference , suggesting that nab treatment at the second stage does not change the growth of neurospheres and persistent hdaci treatment is unnecessary. in other words, hdaci may play a role at the stage of ra induction but not at the stage of neurosphere formation. in fact, we documented that incubating with mgcd for only three days was sufficient to enhance the npc generation , suggesting that hdaci might promote the npc commitment at a very early time point of the npc differentiation.

importantly, as the above neurosphere morphology changes directly reflect the efficiency of npc generation, we determined the efficiency by calculating the number of cells derived from neurospheres on day  <dig>  the neural differentiation of hpscs with or without hdaci treatment was initiated in 6-cm dishes with the same cell number. at the end of the second stage, we found that the number of npcs derived from the neurospheres of both nab- and mgcd-treated cells was 10- to 15-fold more than that of the control cells . these results indicate that suppression of hdacs by hdaci can significantly enhance the differentiation of npcs from hescs.

hdaci do not alter the properties of npcs
we then attempted to identify whether the properties of generated npcs were influenced by the hdaci treatment. we showed that about 95% of the neurosphere cells from hdaci-treated cells were typical npcs as detected by nestin and sox <dig> immunostaining, manifesting no significant differences compared with control cells . furthermore, we found that npcs could differentiate into mature neurons expressing map <dig> and neun with comparable efficiencies , demonstrating that hdaci do not compromise the neuronal differentiation potential of the generated npcs. taken together, these results indicate that hdacs function at the early stage of npc differentiation from hpscs without affecting the integrity of neuronal differentiation of the npcs.figure  <dig>

hdaci promote neuroectodermal specification
in order to explore the mechanisms of hdacs in npc generation, we focused on the first stage of differentiation when hpscs committed to different cell lineages. we found that nab and mgcd altered neither the proliferation of cells  nor cell survival . the cell number of hdaci-treated cells was similar to that of untreated cells during differentiation , suggesting that cell growth during differentiation is not affected by hdaci treatment.figure  <dig>

to elucidate potential molecular networks regulated by hdacs, we performed gene expression profiling of the differentiating cells treated with mgcd on day  <dig> and day  <dig> , as well as the control cells at the same time points of neural differentiation . a total of  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed between the mgcd-treated group and the control group on day  <dig> of differentiation , whereas at the end of this stage,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed  . among them, we found that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed consistently from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after mgcd treatment . gene ontology  analysis of the overlapped genes showed that the genes associated with organismal development, cell differentiation and nervous system development were significantly affected by mgcd treatment during differentiation . furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis of the overlapped genes revealed that multiple signaling pathways relevant to neural differentiation, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase -akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase  and notch signaling pathway, were significantly activated by mgcd .figure  <dig>

from the results of both genome-wide expression analysis and real-time pcr, we found that compared with undifferentiated h <dig>  the transcripts of stemness markers were decreased during differentiation, while the transcripts of the markers of the three germ layers were increased, suggesting that the cells with different fates were specified from h <dig> after ra induction for seven days .figure  <dig>

we assumed that suppression of histone deacetylation might assist ra to induce h <dig> cells to differentiate towards neuroectodermal cells during the first seven days. interestingly, nab and mgcd treatment increased the transcripts of the majority of neuroectodermal markers , while it decreased the transcripts of mesodermal and endodermal markers  . noticeably, the transcript of pax <dig> was increased dramatically after ra treatment and reached a higher level with the addition of nab or mgcd . moreover, we analyzed the cells by immunostaining and flow cytometry with antibodies against pax <dig>  sox <dig> and nestin on day  <dig> of differentiation. we found that the number of dual positive pax6-sox <dig> cells or sox2-nestin cells was significantly increased after nab and mgcd treatment at the end of the ra induction stage . similarly, the protein levels of pax <dig> and sox <dig> in the hdaci-treated cells were significantly higher than in the control cells , confirming that hdaci promote npc differentiation. these results indicate that hdaci might promote neuroectodermal specification at the early stage of differentiation.

we then asked how nab and mgcd enhanced neuroectodermal specification. it is known that hdaci can induce hyperacetylation of histones by inhibiting histone deacetylation. we found that the acetylation levels of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  in the nab- and mgcd-treated cells were higher than that of the control cells on day  <dig> of differentiation . the increased expression of neuroectodermal genes might be directly related to ach3k <dig>  we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  and found that the binding of acetylated histone h <dig> with the promoter of pax <dig> was significantly enhanced in the nab- and mgcd-treated cells, which may contribute to the increased expression of pax <dig> .

taken together, these results suggest that inhibiting histone deacetylation by hdaci could promote the expression of pax <dig> and other neuroectodermal genes and give rise to more cells with a neural cell lineage-fate during ra treatment, thus generating more npcs.

hdaci promote the differentiation of npcs from hipscs
to investigate whether hdacs can regulate the differentiation of npcs from other hpscs, we employed an hipsc line  which was kindly provided by dr. ying jin’s lab  <cit> . we found that nab and mgcd also enhanced the formation of neurospheres of n-ipsc- <dig> . the neurospheres derived from hdaci treatment were significantly larger than controls , and the histone acetylation levels of the hdaci-treated cells were higher than that of the control cells on day  <dig> of differentiation . meanwhile, there were apparently more pax6+, sox2+ and nestin+ cells in the hdaci- treated cells , indicating an increase in conversion of neuroectodermal cells after hdac was inhibited. these results are consistent with those of h <dig>  confirming that inhibiting hdacs can promote differentiation of npcs not only from hescs but also from hipscs in a similar manner.figure  <dig>

knockdown of hdac <dig> or smrt enhances npc generation
we then attempted to identify which hdac critically functioned in npc generation. we knocked down hdac <dig>  hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> individually by several short hairpin rna  sequences and used one non-target shrna sequence as a negative control . we found that the mrna and protein levels of the hdacs were significantly decreased in the transfected cells . interestingly, knockdown of hdac <dig> but not hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> could enhance neurosphere formation as mgcd treatment . although hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> were also the targets of mgcd, there was apparently more cell debris and fewer neurospheres derived from h9-shhdac <dig> cells or even worse in h9-shhdac <dig> cells. we observed that the transcript levels of pax <dig> and sox <dig> were down-regulated whereas the gata <dig> level was up-regulated after hdac <dig> was suppressed, which is just the opposite of the results of mgcd treatment . these results suggest that hdac <dig> but not hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> is the critical regulator that negatively regulates npc generation.figure  <dig>

it has been demonstrated that hdacs execute their functions by forming multiprotein complexes with their cofactors. generally, hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> are recruited to the corepressors rest/corest while hdac <dig> is recruited to ncor/smrt. the complexes then bind to sequence-specific dna, which can condense the chromatin structures and repress gene expression  <cit> . we demonstrated that hdac <dig> interacted with smrt in h <dig> by co-immunoprecipitation  assay . we speculated that hdac <dig> might form this complex with smrt in the npc commitment. to confirm this assumption, we knocked down smrt in h <dig> cells. the expression of smrt was down-regulated in undifferentiated h <dig> and it remained lower in h9-shsmrt cells after seven days of differentiation, as was the expression of hdac <dig> in h9-shhdac <dig> cells . excitingly, the number and size of neurospheres generated from h9-shsmrt cell lines were comparable to those from h9-shhdac <dig> cell lines . also, the expression levels of pax <dig>  sox <dig> and nestin were significantly higher in h9-shhdac <dig>  and h9-shsmrt  cells than in h9-shnc  cells at the end of the first stage, which is consistent with the results of mgcd treatment  . moreover, upon mgcd treatment, h9-shhdac <dig> cells and h9-shsmrt cells showed a further increase in neurosphere formation during differentiation  and an up-regulation in transcripts of pax <dig>  sox <dig> and nestin, but a down-regulation in transcript of gata <dig> , implying that the inhibitor treatment and knockdown of the repressors might have a synergistic effect on npc generation.

we then asked whether knockdown of hdac <dig> or smrt may alter the identity of h <dig>  we found that the profiles of sox <dig> and oct <dig> immunostaining in h9-shhdac <dig> or h9-shsmrt cells were similar to those in h9-shnc . these results suggest that suppression of hdac <dig> or smrt can enhance neuroectodermal specification without compromising the identity of hpscs.

overall, our study reveals that npc specification from hpscs can be repressed by the complex of hdac <dig> and its co-repressor smrt. during the process of neural differentiation, the repression of neuroectodermal genes is attenuated, which is accompanied by an increase in acetylation of target genes . furthermore, hdaci treatment or knockdown of the repressors may further reduce this repression and then promote the hpsc differentiation into npcs .figure  <dig>

discussion
hdacs demonstrate very pleiotropic ability in stem cell differentiation, including acting on nsc, hematopoietic stem cell and cardiac stem cell differentiation  <cit> . previous investigations reported that inhibiting hdacs by hdaci could promote nscs and npcs to differentiate into neuronal or glial cells  <cit> . however, the commitment of npcs from hpscs and further differentiation of npcs into neuronal or glial cells are two successive but different processes regulated by different mechanisms  <cit> .

here we report that hdacs participate in the earlier process of neural differentiation. it has been reported that pax <dig> and sox <dig> control npc identity  <cit> , and pax <dig> is an important transcriptional determinant of human neuroectodermal cell fate; knockdown of pax <dig> blocks neuroectodermal specification from hpscs  <cit> . thus, the up-regulation of pax <dig> and sox <dig> might account for the conversion of more cells with a neuroectodermal fate. in addition, the down-regulated transcripts of mesodermal and endodermal markers in hdaci-treatment cells during the ra induction stage represent a reduction of specification of mesoderm and endoderm cells, which may lead to increased conversion of hpscs towards ectoderm cells. together, the change of cell population at the beginning of neurosphere formation might be one of the reasons that lead to increased npc generation. however, there also exists another possibility that all pscs are directed to differentiate to npc under the induction of ra. however, neural differentiation is a dynamic process, and not all cells can differentiate in a synchronous manner even under the same neural differentiation condition  <cit> . thus, only parts of pscs can finally commit to npcs, while many cells die at the beginning of neurosphere formation. upon hdac suppression, the expression levels of npc markers in all cells are increased, and, therefore, cells are more prone to commit to npcs under that differentiation condition.

we observe that knockdown of hdac <dig> in h <dig> cells shows similar results with those of hdaci treatment, whereas suppression of hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> fails to enhance the npc specification. indeed, there are apparently more dead cells and fewer neurospheres derived from h9-shhdac <dig> and h9-shhdac <dig> than from h9-shnc during differentiation, suggesting that hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> is more likely to function in cell survival or other key cellular events. it has been reported that hdac <dig> deletion causes embryonic lethality before embryonic day  <dig>  in mice  <cit>  and half of hdac2-null mice succumb by postnatal day  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, conditional deletion of both hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> in nscs in mice results in severe brain abnormalities and lethality at postnatal day  <dig>  <cit> . previous studies also showed that deleted hdac <dig> could lead to deficiency in neural crest development in mice  <cit> , and activation of hdac <dig> could enhance endothelial cell differentiation from escs  <cit> . it seems that hdacs have essential, but redundant, functions during neural system development. robustly genetic loss of hdacs may block the process of neural differentiation in mouse brain and lead to developmental defects, whereas inhibition of hdacs to some extent could enhance the npc commitment.

it is known that neuronal genes can be repressed by the complexes of hdacs and their co-repressors in mouse escs, npcs and differentiated non-neuronal cells  <cit> . here we report that individually knocking down any factor of the hdac3/smrt complex can elevate the expressions of neuroectodermal genes, indicating that hdac <dig> might negatively regulate the npc commitment through the repressor complex with smrt. smrt has been shown to inhibit the notch signaling pathway by repressing the transcription of hes <dig>  <cit> . the whole-genome expression analysis in our study reveals that the notch signaling pathway is influenced by mgcd treatment. it is likely that the hdac3/smrt complex regulates npc generation by modifying notch signaling pathway. future studies are needed to further determine the downstream target genes of hdac3/smrt and how this complex regulates npc specification.

furthermore, our findings may also facilitate the establishment of an optimized strategy of neural differentiation from hpscs for future studies. we are able to enhance the generation of npcs from hpscs by 10- to 15-fold through the application of hdaci. although knockdown of hdac <dig> or smrt can promote npc generation, pharmacological inhibition of hdacs is more practical for future clinical application. importantly, hdaci treatment other than knockdown of hdacs can keep genetic fidelity of the cells during differentiation. the similar outcomes from the hipsc line, n-ipsc- <dig>  show that the initial epigenetic landscapes between h <dig> and n-ipsc- <dig>  at least the deacetylation landscapes for neural differentiation, are very similar. it is believed that npcs from patient-specific ipscs are better suited for the transplantation treatment of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. our unpublished data show that the npc generation of alzheimer’s disease  patient-specific ipscs can also be enhanced by hdaci treatment. this might imply a broader application of our findings in ipscs derived from patients with specific neurodegenerative diseases. therefore, our study may provide useful information for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of specific npcs from hpscs and may facilitate their application in npc-transplantation therapies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings demonstrate that hdacs, in particular hdac <dig>  negatively regulate the differentiation of npcs from hpscs. hdac <dig> might orchestrate smrt to form a repressor complex, inhibition of which promotes npc specification. taken together, our data provide a novel regulatory epigenetic mechanism in governing the differentiation of hpscs towards npcs.
