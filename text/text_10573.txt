BACKGROUND
the toxic effects of bilirubin, a bile pigment produced during the catabolism of heme-containing compounds  <cit> , have been documented in various biological systems. nearly all newborn infants develop increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin  in the blood stream, clinically evident as neonatal jaundice  <cit> . although this is a benign and transient phenomenon, abnormal accumulation of bilirubin may cause bilirubin encephalopathy ranging from minimal neurological injury to severe and permanent condition leading to neurodevelopmental dysfunctions  <cit> . furthermore, infants affected by the genetic pathology of crigler-najjar i present high ucb plasma levels and are particularly exposed to bilirubin encephalopathy   <cit> .

the basic mechanisms of hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity have not been fully clarified, although it has been shown that ucb may impair a large number of cellular functions, including energy metabolism  <cit> , cell proliferation  <cit> , dna and protein synthesis  <cit> , receptor functionality  <cit> , and neurotransmitter uptake and release  <cit> . furthermore, in the brain ucb seems more injurious to neurons than to glial cells, with effects that depend on the cellular subtype  <cit> .

the endoplasmic reticulum  plays a crucial role in the synthesis and folding of newly secretory and membrane proteins  <cit> . any perturbation that compromises protein folding and functionality of the er is referred to as er stress. the er stress response can promote cellular repair and survival by reducing the load of unfolded proteins through global attenuation of protein synthesis and by upregulating chaperones  <cit> . this response is collectively termed as the unfolded protein response  and is mediated by three er transmembrane receptors: pancreatic er kinase perk  kinase  <dig> ), inositol-requiring enzyme  <dig>  and activating transcription factor  <dig> .

in resting cells, all of these er stress receptors are maintained in an active state through their association with the er chaperone grp <dig> . an accumulation of unfolded proteins causes dissociation of grp <dig> from perk, ire <dig> and atf <dig>  thereby initiating the upr. thus upr is a pro-survival response to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins and restore normal function  <cit> . however, when misfolded-protein aggregation persists and er stress cannot be resolved, signalling switches from a pro-survival to a pro-apoptotic pathway.

recently, the er has attracted attention as a key subcellular compartment in which the effects of several cellular stresses may contribute to pathological processes culminating in neuronal injury and degeneration. a central role of er dysfunction is evident in various pathologies of the brain, including acute injuries  and neurodegenerative disorders   <cit> .

the present study was designed to analyze the consequences of bilirubin exposure to better understand the molecular processes underlying neuronal damage and homeostasis. we used high density oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze the gene expression profile of human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells upon ucb treatment. gene expression data and experimental validation point to er stress as the major intracellular homeostatic response in surviving cells.

RESULTS
characterization of the cell viability of ucb treated sh-sy5y cells
the human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cell line is a well-established in vitro cellular model to study the biological consequences of neuroactive molecules, drugs and toxins. to assess ucb effects, we have taken advantage of previous studies where the outcome of clinically relevant ucb concentrations was tested and the cytotoxic effects revealed  <cit> . the sensitivity of sh-sy5y cells to ucb treatment was thus evaluated by measuring cell viability after exposing cells to a concentration of free bilirubin of  <dig> nm  for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. as shown in figure  <dig>  cell viability was reduced to 60% already after  <dig> h of ucb treatment and the extent of reduction in cell viability never exceeded the 40% of the cell population, even with longer treatments.

gene expression analysis by oligonucleotide arrays in ucb treated sh-sy5y cells
to examine the molecular events associated with the homeostatic response to ucb treatment, high density oligonucleotide microarrays  were used to interrogate the expression of over  <dig>  transcripts. rna was isolated from sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells treated with bf  <dig> nm for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. experiments were performed in three biological replicates with control samples monitoring the effects of dmso used as bf solvent.

analysis of the microarray hybridization data, as reported in methods, produced a list of  <dig> probe sets with a false discovery rate  of 10%. this list corresponded to  <dig> genes upregulated after  <dig> h of ucb treatment . no down-regulated genes were detected. the fold change of transcript levels ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the majority of which being toward the lower end. a list of all differentially expressed genes is provided in the additional file  <dig>  no significant changes of gene expression were observed after  <dig> and  <dig> h of ucb treatment . we obtained a list of  <dig> probe sets when a fdr of 0% was applied and a list of  <dig> probe sets with a fdr of 5%. furthermore,  <dig> probe sets were induced with a fdr of 20% with no down-regulated genes .

differentially expressed genes were then examined for their gene ontology  annotations concerning their cellular localization. as shown in table  <dig> and as detailed in the additional file  <dig>  the analysis revealed that these genes were mainly distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum , the golgi apparatus  and in the nucleus. to obtain insights into the pathways in which they were mainly involved, genes were sorted into distinct functional subgroups. ucb treatment induced genes belonging to functional categories related to the upr in the protein secretory pathway  as well as to regulation of transcription and dna-dependent processes . a set of up-regulated genes included plasma membrane transporters of the family of the solute carrier transporters  and other genes involved in amino acid metabolism . in the remaining part of the manuscript the attention will be focused on the upr and er stress responses, since the majority of up-regulated genes are well known members of these homeostatic pathways.

the table shows the number and percentage  of the  <dig> total genes that were recognized as valid gene names in the gene_association.goa_human_hgnc file according to go slim terms from the cellular ontology in regard to endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus and nucleus localization. all details are reported in table s <dig> in the additional file  <dig> 

genes are sub-categorized according to their go biological process annotation. fold changes  are fold differences for cells treated with bf  <dig> nm versus cells grown in dmso  <dig> %  for  <dig> h. affymetrix probe set-ids, gene names and symbol, fold change , and cellular location are indicated.

ucb treatment induced expression of er stress genes in the upr of the secretory pathway
upr serves many aspects of the secretory pathway and is predominantly involved in the response to stress conditions when proteins are misfolded. go categories of upr components induced by ucb are shown in table  <dig>  these include stress sensing and signalling, protein folding, translocation, vesicular transport and er-associated degradation. genes known or predicted by sequence homology to play a physiological role in secretion or in the biogenesis of organelles were also increased.

the largest group of up-regulated genes was represented by er-resident molecular chaperone and oxido-reductase proteins. among the molecular chaperones, we found established upr target genes such as hspa <dig>  , known also as grp <dig>  or bip  <cit> , hsp90b  , member 1), dnajb <dig>  and dnajc <dig>  <cit> . additional genes included pdia <dig> , pdia <dig>  and ero1lb  that are involved in oxidative protein folding  <cit> .

a second major group was composed by genes involved in co-translational translocation of proteins across the er membrane, to the golgi and in the anterograde/retrograde transport back into the cytosol. the group included the signal sequence receptor ssr <dig> , the translocating chain-associating membrane protein tram <dig> , members of the sec <dig> complex, such as sec61a <dig> , sec61a <dig>  and sec <dig> , and serp <dig>  , also known as ramp <dig> , that is a sec61-associated polypeptide specifically induced by er stress  <cit> . up-regulated genes were also represented by the coated vesicle membrane proteins, such as sec23b , sec24d , sec31a  and scfd <dig> , as well as by the transmembrane trafficking proteins tmed <dig> , tmed <dig>  and tmed <dig> .

the er-associated degradation  system eliminates misfolded proteins by their retrotranslocation across the er membrane into the cytosol, where ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes target them for proteosomal degradation. erad requires a number of dedicated er-resident factors. indeed, herpud <dig> or herp    <cit>  was significantly induced as well as edem <dig>    <cit> , sel1l , a transmembrane cofactor of the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase hrd <dig>  <cit> , and derl <dig>   whose product associates with edem <dig> and is a specific target of the ire <dig> branch of the upr response  <cit> .

ucb treatment induced expression of proteins relevant in the regulation of transcription during er stress response
as shown in table  <dig>  several differentially expressed genes were classified into the go category of "regulation of transcription, dna-dependent". up-regulated transcription factors included two established upr target genes: ddit <dig> , also known as chop or c/ebp homologous protein, and xbp <dig>  x box-binding protein  <dig> . chop is a 29-kda leucine zipper transcription factor that is ubiquitously expressed at a low level and robustly up-regulated in response to various stress conditions  <cit> . chop is proapoptotic and a key mediator of er stress-induced cell death  <cit> . xbp <dig> gene, after a nonconventional splicing event  <cit> , codes for a transcription activator that regulates a subset of er-resident chaperones that are essential for protein folding, maturation and degradation in the er  <cit> . additional stress-responsive transcriptional regulators induced by ucb included atf <dig> , atf <dig> , atf <dig> , cebpb , cebpg , jun  and jund . interestingly, although atf <dig> showed a moderate induction, several of its downstream targets were strongly up-regulated, e.g. ddit <dig>  atf <dig>  cebpb, cebpg, creb3l <dig>  and trib <dig> . trib <dig>  is an er stress-inducible gene that is involved in chop-dependent cell death as a second messenger during er stress  <cit> .

ucb treatment induced expression of genes involved in protein synthesis/translation, autophagy and aminoacid transport/metabolism
the translational machinery for a new boost of protein synthesis has been suggested to be amplified during upr-associated translational attenuation  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  we observed an up-regulation of  <dig> trna synthetase genes, such as aars , cars , gars , mars , sars  and wars , which are involved in trna processing. we also observed the induction of  <dig> eukaryotic translation initiation factors, that are eif <dig>  and eif <dig> . one of the stronger up-regulated genes was fam129a  , also known as niban, which has been recently demonstrated to be involved in the er stress response and to positively affect the protein translation machinery by regulating the mtor pathway  <cit> . interestingly, the list of genes induced during ucb treatment also includes ddit <dig>  , also known as redd1/rtp801/dig <dig>  that is another well-known regulator of the mtor pathway  <cit> . the mtor-dependent pathway is strongly connected to the autophagic machinery, and indeed autophagy-related genes such as gabarapl <dig>  receptor-associated protein like  <dig> or atg8) , gabarapl <dig>  receptors-associated protein like  <dig> )  and wipi <dig>   were also positively differentially expressed, suggesting that surviving neuroblastoma cells may present an induction of autophagy  <cit> .

ucb exposure also activated genes involved in amino acid metabolism . among the strongest up-regulated genes, slc7a <dig>  and slc3a <dig>  were identified. these two genes encode respectively for xct, the light chain subunit, and for 4f2hc, the glycosylated heavy-chain subunit, that are components of the system xct, anionic amino acid transport system specific for cystine and glutamate  <cit> . recently, the ucb-induced slc7a <dig>  has been shown to physically and functionally interact with slc3a <dig>  forming a bidirectional amino acid transporter and representing a key regulator of both the mtor pathway and autophagy  <cit> .

validation of selected genes by quantitative rt-pcr 
for validation, we selected genes considered of interest based on their involvement in er stress response. gene expression levels of ddit <dig>  hspa <dig>  xbp <dig>  herpud <dig>  trib <dig>  fam129a and slc7a <dig> were verified by qrt-pcr. results are reported in figure  <dig>  the fold differences determined by qrt-pcr were very similar to those obtained by the high density oligonucleotide microarray gene expression analysis.

analysis of xbp <dig> splicing and ddit3/chop subcellular localization in ucb treated sh-sy5y cells
we investigated two independent events that are known activators of the er stress transcriptional program: unconventional splicing of xbp <dig> and cytoplasm/nuclear shuttling of ddit3/chop. the splicing of xbp <dig> transcript changes its open reading frame to code for a transcription factor  that activates the expression of a subset of er stress/upr related genes  <cit> . here we show that ucb treatment is indeed able to trigger this unconventional splicing . the nuclear localization of the transcription factor ddit3/chop  <cit>  is one of the most commonly used indicators of er stress. as presented in figure 3b, we observed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in untreated and dmso  <dig> % control cells, but a major nuclear staining in cells treated with bf  <dig> nm. this indicates activation of a chop-dependent transcriptional program. these data represent an independent proof of the induction of a vigorous er stress.

discussion
bilirubin encephalopathy is one of the consequences of severe hyperbilirubinemia and is characterized by multifocal deposition of ucb in selected regions of the brain, resulting in temporary or permanent impairment of auditory, motor or mental functions  <cit> . cellular ucb level is closely related to the free concentration  of the pigment in plasma and to the mechanisms regulating the traffic of ucb among plasma, cerebral spinal fluid and cells. although ucb is formed in virtually all cells and may enter by passive diffusion  <cit> , intracellular concentration is determined by cellular export and metabolic transformation of the pigment. interestingly, only certain neuronal cell types present a ucb susceptibility to undergo necrosis and apoptosis  <cit> , whereas astrocytes are relatively spared. this has been linked to a higher content of mrp <dig>  a transporter with high affinity to ucb  <cit>  able to keep the intracellular ucb concentration low. importantly, the level of mrp <dig> expression in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells is inversely and linearly correlated with ucb toxic effects  <cit> .

the molecular mechanisms of intracellular ucb toxicity are still unclear  <cit> . ucb has been initially proved to be a pro-apoptotic agent, suppressing cell growth by inducing dna fragmentation, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase- <dig> and cleavage of polyribose polymerase  <cit> . more recently, oxidative stress has emerged as a potential crucial event, since its generation mirrors ucb-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . in various cellular systems, ucb causes reactive oxygen species  production, protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and disruption of glutathione metabolism  <cit> . furthermore, ucb-mediated oxidative stress is also in part responsible for inhibition of cell growth  <cit> . inhibition of cell proliferation has been indeed observed in primary vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro as well as inferred by gene expression data on the repression of cell cycle-related genes in the liver of a mouse model of crigler-najjar type i disease  <cit> . to study the effects of intracellular ucb on neurons, we took advantage of the human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cell line. these cells have been widely used in neurobiology as the in vitro system of choice to dissect molecular pathways leading to neurodegeneration. previous studies have already shown that neuroblastoma cells are a good in vitro model to address the consequences of clinically relevant ucb concentrations  <cit> . although we are aware of the limitations in the use of a neuroblastoma cell line to recapitulate dysfunctions that occur in neonatal human brain, this experimental model allowed us to dissect in details the molecular events elicited by ucb.

treatment with bf  <dig> nm was highly toxic, triggering death in 40% of the cells within one hour. this is expected since the accepted threshold for bilirubin toxicity approximately occurs at  <dig> nm  <cit> . 63% reduction in cell viability at  <dig> h after bilirubin exposure were previously demonstrated in the rat neuroblastoma n- <dig> cell line  <cit> . furthermore, silva rf et al.  <cit>  showed  <dig> nm bf triggered deleterious effects on mitochondrial function.

a full understanding of molecular mechanisms of cell death will require additional investigation. ucb has been previously proved to induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, although necrosis could not be excluded  <cit> .

furthermore, the criteria to distinguish sensitive from insensitive neuroblastoma cells remain unclear. one may speculate that subtle heterogeneity in the level of differentiation may play a role in susceptibility to insults. alternatively, cell death induction may depend on cell cycle position.

we then focused on the 60% of surviving cells to test the hypothesis that these neurons may express a homeostatic response.

a gene expression approach was carried out to identify gene expression patterns and signalling pathways induced upon ucb treatment. no significant changes of gene expression were observed after  <dig> and  <dig> h of ucb treatment. after  <dig> h,  <dig> genes were induced while no down-regulated genes were observed even when an fdr of 20% was applied.

the lack of an "early response" is surprising since it fails to provide a potential mechanism for cell survival within the first hour. therefore, present data suggest that it is very unlikely that the molecular pathways induced at  <dig> hours play a role in the survival of cells after one hour of treatment.

go analysis of the "late response" genes proved for the first time that ucb treatment induces an er stress response in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. evidences for er stress involvement are overwhelming. among others, genes induced by ucb treatment include several molecular chaperones like bip, a well-known marker of er overload, as well as molecular components of the erad system, that has been recently positioned in a central stage among the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration  <cit> . furthermore, two well-known events in er stress, such as xbp <dig> unconventional splicing and ddit3/chop nuclear relocation, were proved to be triggered by ucb treatment, therefore providing additional experimental evidences.

ucb also altered several components of the translational machinery including trna synthesis genes and translation initiation factors. the translation machinery is considered one of the major targets of the er stress response to regulate protein synthesis and decrease protein overload. since no data are available in literature about the relationship between ucb intracellular concentration and translation rate, there is a compelling need for an accurate proteomic analysis of ucb effects in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells. a complementary cellular strategy in er stress conditions includes an increase in protein degradation. in this context some ucb-induced genes suggested a role for autophagy. it is of notice that autophagy has been recently associated with neurodegenerative diseases as well as with inhibition of cell growth and entering into a quiescent state  <cit> . this may correlate to previous reports showing a severe inhibition of cell proliferation mediated by ucb  <cit> . further experimental validation is needed to prove an increase of autophagy.

finally, the induction of both subunits of the transport system x was also observed: slc3a <dig>  and slc7a <dig>  are able to heterodimerize to mediate cystine-glutamate exchange and regulate intracellular glutathione levels. since the maintenance of a high glutathione concentration may be protective  <cit> , we speculate that induction of the x transport system may represent a major pro-survival response, as has been recently shown in neurons  <cit> . interestingly, we could not observe any significant differential gene expression of mrp <dig> at any point of the time course suggesting that this transporter plays a negligible role in ucb-induced adaptation in this in vitro model.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study shows for the first time that intracellular accumulation of ucb in surviving neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cell line provokes er stress.
