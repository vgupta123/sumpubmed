BACKGROUND
ramularia leaf spot has emerged as a newly important disease of barley associated with significant grain yield and quality losses across europe and a number of other temperate regions of the world  <cit> . the disease was first recognised in  <dig> in italy and the fungal pathogen first described as ophiocladium hordei  <cit> . sutton and waller  <cit>  reclassified this ascomycete fungus to the genus ramularia, within the family mycosphaerellaceae in the class dothideomycetes and proposed the species name r. collo-cygni because of the distinctive swan’s neck-like shape of the fungal conidiophores . this systematic position was subsequently supported by phylogenetic analysis of fungal ribosomal dna sequences  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ramularia leaf spot symptoms and r. collo-cygni development on barley. a electron micrograph of the characteristic swan neck-shaped conidiophore of ramularia collo-cygni. b light micrograph of a cluster of r. collo-cygni conidiophores, from field infected plants, erupting from spring barley cv. cocktail leaves at gs80+. c characteristic ramularia leaf spot symptoms on leaves of winter barley cv. saffron. d spider-web growth of gfp-transformed r. collo-cygni isolate rcc-8b9-gfp  <cit>  on leaf surface of spring barley cv. optic, 7 days post infection without triggering host immune response. e confocal image of rubellin autofluorescence in r. collo-cygni isolate b <dig>  superimposed on bright field transmission image. note various sizes of vacuole-like vesicles within the collapsed hyphae. f confocal image of a viable hypha of the transgenic isolate rcc-8b9-gfp carrying rubellin vesicles



the importance of ramularia leaf spot as a disease of barley has become more apparent in recent years as reliable methods for isolation and detection of r. collo-cygni have become available . ramularia leaf spot is often confused with physiological leaf spotting and leaf spotting diseases, such as net blotch caused by the fungus pyrenophora teres, but is distinguished by characteristic reddish-brown, rectangular lesions visible on both sides of the leaf and surrounded by a chlorotic halo . recently reclassified as a major pathogen of its main host plant barley , r. collo-cygni has also been reported to colonise wheat, rye, oats, maize and many other grass species including the model brachypodium distachyon  <cit> . r. collo-cygni is transmitted both via spores and through infected seeds  <cit> , and exhibits intercellular, apoplastic colonisation of its host  <cit> . disease is typically observed late in the growing season after the crop flowers, suggesting a link between ramularia leaf spot symptom expression and host developmental stage  <cit> . however, r. collo-cygni can also colonise the host asymptomatically . expression of ramularia leaf spot symptoms has been linked to host genetics  but, as with many other dothideomycete diseases, expression of symptoms has a strong environmental component, in particular responding to light intensity . this lifestyle, asymptomatic vertical transmission through seeds combined with the ability to switch lifestyle when faced with an adverse host environment, is reminiscent of that followed by many plant endophytes  <cit> . indeed, it was proposed that r. collo-cygni was ancestrally an endophyte and that pathogenicity is a more recent evolutionary phenomenon  <cit> . whether changes in pathogen or host genetics or agronomic practices have resulted in the emergence of ramularia leaf spot as an important pathogen of barley since the late 1990s is currently unclear.

many dothideomycetes produce secondary metabolites that are involved in fungal pathogenesis and/or virulence  <cit> . r. collo-cygni produces a number of anthraquinone-derived secondary metabolites called rubellins  <cit> . rubellin d, the most widely studied of these compounds, is a light activated, nonhost specific phytotoxin  <cit> . rubellins are likely to be synthesised through a polyketide synthase pathway  <cit> , similar to toxin production in other dothideomycetes  <cit> . rubellin d may act by increasing reactive oxygen species  production resulting in α-linolenic acid peroxidation, leaf chlorosis and necrosis  <cit> . how r. collo-cygni produces these toxic secondary metabolites and what roles rubellins have in fungal colonisation and disease expression remains to be determined.

to address these and other questions relating to the biology of this fungus and its phylogenetic position within the dothideomycetes, we have sequenced and assembled the genome of r. collo-cygni isolate dk <dig> rcc <dig> . we compare the genome to those of other plant pathogens including zymoseptoria tritici , pseudocercospora fijiensis  and dothistroma septosporum  from the mycosphaerellaceae. the high-quality genome of r. collo-cygni provides a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding why ramularia leaf spot has emerged as an important threat to barley production.

RESULTS
genome assembly and annotation of gene models
the  <dig>  mb r. collo-cygni genome was sequenced using a combination of illumina and roche  <dig> flx technologies to 90-fold coverage and assembled into  <dig> contigs ranging from 200 bp to  <dig> ,477 bp in size . there were  <dig> contigs greater than 1 kb in length which had an average gc content of  <dig>  % and accounted for  <dig>  mb of the assembly . we predicted  <dig>  protein-coding gene models, of which  <dig> had transcript evidence from rnaseq analysis of in vitro fungal cultures . the average coding sequence length was 1423 bp, with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp. both the estimated r. collo-cygni genome size and number of predicted gene models are similar to those of other dothideomycetes  <cit>  including z. tritici  <cit>  and d. septosporum  <cit> . the genome appears relatively complete, with 94 % of the  <dig> core eukaryotic gene models in the cegma toolkit judged to be complete in the assembly. a genome browser presenting the r. collo-cygni genome data can be found at http://ramularia.org/jbrowse and the sequence data has been submitted to the european nucleotide archive .table  <dig> general features of the ramularia collo-cygni isolate dk <dig> rcc <dig> genome assembly

each predicted gene model was annotated using blast2go   <cit> . most of the top blastp matches for the predicted protein set were to z. tritici , d. septosporum  and p. fijiensis , as expected from their phylogenetic relatedness . one sixth  had no significant matches in the ncbi nr database. for  <dig> r. collo-cygni gene models we gathered  <dig>  level  <dig> gene ontology  terms which were classified into the categories biological process, molecular function and cellular component .fig.  <dig> distribution of blast2go gene ontology  categories from the putative ramularia collo-cygni gene model annotation. a biological processes, b molecular function, c cellular component



phylogenetic relationships of r. collo-cygni and dothideomycete fungi
we identified  <dig> orthologous protein sets that were largely single-copy across  <dig> fungal taxa, focusing on dothideomycetes. phylogenetic analysis of these alignments clearly positioned r. collo-cygni within the order capnodiales in the mycosphaerellaceae . within the mycosphaerellaceae r. collo-cygni was sister to z. tritici. the other three mycosphaerellaceae assessed  formed a sister clade to r. collo-cygni plus z. tritici, congruent with previous, less-complete studies which did not include r. collo-cygni  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships between ramularia collo-cygni and  <dig> other fungi with sequenced genomes. maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on a supermatrix analysis of  <dig> proteins from  <dig> taxa . branch support is shown as the number of gene trees out of  <dig> that supported the presented topology. bootstrap values are 99– <dig> for each branch and therefore not shown. branch length corresponds to a mean estimate of substitutions per site as indicated by the scale bar



the r. collo-cygni secretome and candidate effector proteins
we identified  <dig> genes encoding putative secreted proteins, approximately 9 % of the r. collo-cygni proteome, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length. the predicted r. collo-cygni secretome is similar in size to secretomes of other dothideomycetes such as z. tritici  <cit>  and d. septosporum  <cit> . most of the predicted secreted proteins  had significant sequence similarity  to proteins from other organisms, with matches to z. tritici , p. fijiensis , d. septosporum  and sphaerulina musiva  most common. most  of the predicted secreted proteins were annotated with go terms, the commonest being “oxidation and reduction”, “carbohydrate metabolism” and “proteolysis” in the biological process hierarchy, and “hydrolase activity including hydrolysis of carbohydrates” and “proteins with redox related functions including oxidoreductase and peroxidase activity” in the molecular function hierarchy . in the z. tritici secretome the protein family domain pf <dig>  corresponding to peroxidase_ <dig> family or chloroperoxidase, was abundant  <cit> . transcriptome profiling during z. tritici infection highlighted up-regulation of chloroperoxidase genes during asymptomatic intercellular growth of the fungus  <cit> . this family was also found to be expanded in genomes of other plant pathogens within the mycosphaerellaceae compared to other plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> . matches to this domain were found in  <dig> different proteins in the r. collo-cygni secretome . most other mycosphaerellaceae fungi have  <dig> or more chloroperoxidase genes whereas most other plant pathogenic fungi including dothideomycetes of the order pleosporales typically have less than  <dig> of these genes  <cit> . this expanded family of chloroperoxidases may play an important role during the endophytic stage of r. collo-cygni colonisation.

many experimentally validated plant pathogen effectors are secreted, cysteine-rich, low molecular weight proteins, termed small secreted proteins . a total of  <dig> proteins from the predicted r. collo-cygni secretome matched these criteria . effectors are frequently pathogen-specific and just over half  of the r. collo-cygni ssps had no significant similarity to proteins found in public databases, suggesting they are unique to this species. previously reported estimates of the proportion of species-specific ssps across dothideomycetes range from  <dig> to 30 %  <cit> . the rest of the r. collo-cygni ssps  had significant similarities to proteins from other organisms, in particular z. tritici , s. musiva  and p. fijiensis . only  <dig>  ssps had predicted pfam domains, reflecting the typically unknown function of effector proteins. sixty-seven  of the predicted ssps had transcript support from in vitro grown fungal mycelial rnaseq. r. collo-cygni ssp gene models that had no transcript support are of particular interest as they may only be expressed in planta. overall, while there appears to be a degree of sequence conservation between secreted proteins of r. collo-cygni and other mycosphaerella fungi the function of these putative effector proteins in the biology of the different diseases is currently unknown. variation between repertoires of putative effector proteins of each species are likely to contribute to the distinct biology of these pathogens. it should also be noted that the analysis of the putative effector content of the r. collo-cygni genome may not have been exhaustive. evidence from the genome of the obligate biotroph b. graminis f. sp. tritici has indicated the presence of putative effector proteins that do not contain a signal peptide suggesting that they are either non-secreted or secreted through an alternative pathway  <cit> . furthermore, plant pathogen effectors are often associated with genomic regions rich in repetitive dna  <cit> . due to the small nature of effector proteins it is possible that the gene annotation process may not have detected them. as such further analysis of the putative effector complement and subsequent characterisation of species-specific ssps that are specifically expressed in planta may provide further clues to the mechanisms of r. collo-cygni pathogenicity.

pathogenicity and virulence genes
fungi use diverse infection strategies for host colonisation and fungal development. we used the pathogen-host interaction database, phi-base  <cit> , to determine the presence in r. collo-cygni of orthologues of pathogenicity genes experimentally confirmed in other fungal species. a total of  <dig> r. collo-cygni gene models matched  <dig> phi-base accessions . these genes encoded transporters, transcription factors, secondary metabolite biosynthesis enzymes and previously characterised effectors from other pathogens, including three bec-type effectors from b. graminis f. sp. hordei  <cit> . of particular interest was the identification of  <dig> r. collo-cygni gene models that matched known dothideomycetes pathogenicity determinants that are associated with toxin production. we identified putative orthologues of proteins involved in biosynthesis of the host-specific hc-toxin  and t- toxin  from cochliobolus spp. and the ak-toxin , acr-toxin  and act-toxin  produced by alternaria alternata  <cit>  were identified in the r. collo-cygni genome. putative orthologues of genes involved in the biosynthesis  and transport  of the cercosporin toxin produced by cercospora spp.  <cit>  were also identified. cercosporin is a perylenequinone compound that is a light activated nonhost specific pathogenesis-related toxin  <cit> . the rubellin toxins produced by r. collo-cygni also cause light-activated in planta necrosis, fatty acid peroxidation and ros production  <cit> . although to date the only toxins characterised in r. collo-cygni are the rubellins, it is probable that this fungus produces a complex arsenal of toxins to facilitate host colonisation and niche exploitation. determining whether r. collo-cygni produces toxins related to cercosporin or toxins characterised in other dothideomycetes is an important research goal.

carbohydrate-active enzymes
fungal pathogens need to derive carbohydrates from their hosts and therefore express an array of enzymes capable of metabolising different carbohydrate substrates. the diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes  can provide insights into the biology of fungal interactions with their specific hosts  <cit> . r. collo-cygni had a total of  <dig> cazymes,  <dig> of which were predicted to be secreted. we identified  <dig> glycoside hydrolases ,  <dig> polysaccharide lyases ,  <dig> carbohydrate esterases ,  <dig> auxiliary activities ,  <dig> glycosyltransferases  and  <dig> carbohydrate-binding modules . the overall cazyme complement of r. collo-cygni is consistent with that observed in other dothideomycetes  <cit> . gh enzymes hydrolyze bonds linking carbohydrates to other molecules  <cit> . specific gh family members act on different polysaccharide components of plant cell walls such that the genomic complement of these enzymes can be associated with the trophic habit of fungal pathogens  <cit> . the gh family complement was compared to that of  <dig> other fungal species with differing trophic strategies including other dothideomycetes, ascomycetes and basidiomycetes  <cit> . cluster analysis of the gh family positioned the capnodiales in a cluster distinct from the pleosporales  in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . within the capnodiales cluster r. collo-cygni was placed in a sub-cluster together with the mycosphaerella species . further inspection of the gh complement of r. collo-cygni highlighted that mycosphaerella species and r. collo-cygni have a reduced complement of cellulose-degrading gh enzymes compared to other dothideomycetes . in particular, r. collo-cygni has a severely reduced complement of aa <dig>  copper-dependent, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase enzymes and no gh <dig>  or gh <dig>  enzymes. the gh <dig> family members were present in all of the other fungi examined except the biotrophs b. graminis f. sp hordei and ustilago maydis, and the symbiont l. bicolor .fig.  <dig> comparison of ramularia collo-cygni glycoside hydrolase  family complement with  <dig> other fungal species. gh families and fungal species are hierarchically organised with the heat map indicating the number of members in each family . ptt = pyrenophora teres f. sp teres; ptr = pyrenophora tritici-repentis; bgh = blumeria graminis f. sp hordei; pgt = puccinia graminis f. sp tritici; mlp = melampsora larici-populina

many economically important fungal pathogens of the genus mycosphaerella have long latent periods of asymptomatic growth before disease occurs . as such these fungi need to avoid detection by the host’s defence system to allow successful colonisation. z. tritici and c. fulvum secrete carbohydrate-binding module  <dig>  domain proteins containing lysm motifs that act to sequester chitin and interfere with chitin-triggered host immunity  <cit> , preventing recognition of the pathogen by the host chitin receptors cerk <dig> and cebip <dig>  <cit> . r. collo-cygni has at least three cbm <dig> containing proteins  which is in the range for most dothideomycetes except for colletotrichum spp. where gene expansion of the cbm <dig> family has been reported  <cit> .

plant immune systems can recognise and degrade fungal chitin, and some species display active remodelling of the cell wall during invasion. cbm <dig> and cbm <dig> family proteins bind chitin  <cit> , and the cbm14-domain effector protein avr <dig> from the biotroph fungus c. fulvum can bind chitin at the fungal cell wall to prevent its enzymatic degradation by chitinases  <cit> . no cbm <dig> family proteins were detected in the r. collo-cygni genome. a lack of avr4-like proteins was also reported for z. tritici where instead the cbm <dig> containing mg1lysm and mg3lysm proteins are able to bind chitin and protect fungi from hydrolytic chitinases  <cit> . r. collo-cygni has six cbm <dig> family proteins, similar to other mycosphaerella species, but compared to other dothideomycetes, r. collo-cygni and the capnodiales typically have a contracted cbm <dig> domain family. some biotrophic rust fungi and colletotrichum graminicola have been shown to convert chitin in the fungal cell walls of hyphae growing on the leaf surface to chitosan, through the action of chitin deacetylase  and chitin synthase , once invasive hyphae penetrate the leaf surface  <cit> , and this may prevent host chitinases from digesting invading hyphae. r. collo-cygni has twenty-one gt <dig> proteins which is at the higher end of the range observed in dothideomycetes but similar to the gt <dig> complement of p. fijiensis and the extremophilic saprotroph baudoinia compniacensis  <cit> . r. collo-cygni also has six ce <dig> proteins, the same number found in z. tritici, d. septosporum, p. fijiensis and c. fulvum, but fewer than in any of the pleosporales fungi .

the reduced number of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in r. collo-cygni coupled with the presence of genes with known roles in avoiding chitin recognition by host defence systems suggests that this species may also utilise “stealth pathogenesis”, as proposed for z. tritici  <cit> . r. collo-cygni is frequently detected in the field in the absence of visible disease  <cit> . fungal biomass can build up during asymptomatic development suggesting the fungus is able to avoid recognition by the host  <cit> . expression of ramularia leaf spot symptoms in hosts has a host genetic component  <cit>  but is also modulated by changes in host abiotic stress  <cit>  and development  <cit> . these features of the pathogenesis of ramularia leaf spot, combined with the vertical transmission of r. collo-cygni, suggest that this species is actually an endophyte that only becomes pathogenic under specific conditions  <cit> . the closely-related z. tritici is proposed to have evolved from an endophytic ancestor  <cit> , and r. collo-cygni may be an endophyte in which pathogenicity has evolved more recently  <cit> . determining the roles that cazymes play during the symptomless and necrotrophic phases will provide valuable insights into the fungal and host cues that trigger r. collo-cygni switching from endophytic to pathogenic development.

peptidases
peptidases have multiple functions in plant pathogens including degradation of host defence proteins, signalling and nutrition. r. collo-cygni was predicted to have  <dig> putative peptidases of which 46 % were serine peptidases. metallopeptidases  and cysteine peptidases  were also highly represented, whereas lower numbers of aspartic  and threonine  peptidases and single glutamic and n <dig> asparagine peptidases were identified. five gene models were classified as peptidase inhibitors . the distribution of peptidase classes observed in r. collo-cygni was similar to that in z. tritici, p. fijiensis and d. septosporum . ninety-four  peptidases were predicted to be secreted, and most of these were either serine  or metallo-peptidases . typically serine, metallo- and cysteine peptidases are the most prevalent types in dothideomycetes whereas asparagine peptidases are relatively uncommon  <cit> .table  <dig> peptidase complement of ramularia collo-cygni, zymoseptoria tritici, dothistroma septosporum and pseudocercospora fijiensis

secondary metabolites and rubellin toxin biosynthesis cluster
many plant pathogenic fungi produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, some of which have important roles in virulence and disease. these are derived from four core biosynthetic origins: polyketide synthases ; non-ribosomal peptide synthases ; terpene cyclases  and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases   <cit> . r. collo-cygni produces nonhost-specific photodynamic anthraquinone toxins, called rubellins  that are most likely derived from polyketides  <cit> . within the r. collo-cygni genome  <dig> pks, fourteen nrps and four tc were located . no dmats were identified. r. collo-cygni has similar numbers of nrps and tc genes as other dothideomycetes. however, the number of pks in r. collo-cygni is nearly double that described for other members of the capnodiales .table  <dig> comparison of lifestyle and key secondary metabolism genes between ramularia collo-cygni and other selected dothideomycetes

the rubellin toxins produced by r. collo-cygni are predicted to be synthesised through a polyketide-derived pathway  <cit> . polyketide-derived toxins from other dothideomycetes, such as the d. septosporum-produced dothistromin, are synthesised through pathways similar to that used to produce aflatoxin in aspergillus spp.  <cit> . biosynthesis of aflatoxin requires at least  <dig> enzymes as well as some regulatory proteins, and the genes encoding these are clustered together in a 70 kb region of the aspergillus genome . an ancestral core cluster, required to form the initial polyketide product, has been proposed that comprises the genes afpksa, affas- <dig>  affas- <dig> and afnor- <dig>  possibly along with regulatory genes afaflr and afaflj  <cit> . dothistromin has some structural similarity to the aflatoxin intermediate versicolorin b  <cit>  and functional orthologues of aflatoxin biosynthesis genes have been described in d. septosporum, although the dothistromin metabolic cluster is fragmented into dspksa, dsvbsa, dsaflr/dsaflj, dsest, and dsver <dig> mini-clusters, across a single chromosome . homologs of most dothistromin biosynthesis genes have been found in other dothideomycete genomes with the complete set identified in c. fulvum, a sister species to d. septosporum, even though no dothistromin production by this fungus has been reported  <cit> .fig.  <dig> arrangement of predicted toxin biosynthesis genes across aspergillus flavus, dothistroma septosporum and ramularia collo-cygni.

as r. collo-cygni produces the polyketide-derived rubellin toxins and due to the close phylogenetic relationship between r. collo-cygni and d. septosporum  we used the protein sequences of known dothistromin and aflatoxin biosynthesis genes  <cit>  to identify candidate toxin biosynthesis genes in r. collo-cygni . homologues of all  <dig> genes found in the six dothistromin biosynthetic mini-clusters  <cit>  were identified . however, reciprocal blastp analyses indicated that only nine of these proteins were likely to be orthologous to the canonical toxin production loci. the others were identified as orthologues of related enzymes, as has been reported from most other dothideomycetes  <cit> . d. septosporum dsavna and dsverb both had the closest similarity to the same r. collo-cygni gene model. the dothistromin biosynthetic clusters found in d. septosporum were not conserved in r. collo-cygni . two putative homologs of genes from each of the dspksa and dsvbsa clusters appear to co-locate in the r. collo-cygni genome. rccpksa  and rccavfa  reductase) were identified on the  <dig>  bp scaffold m <dig> , whereas rcchexa and rcchexb, fatty acid synthases from the dsvbsa cluster, were located on the  <dig>  bp contig <dig> . while the r. collo-cygni genome has not been assembled to chromosome level, the lack of observed synteny for these loci is telling and suggests that any toxins produced by r. collo-cygni are likely to be synthesized through pathways distinct from those in d. septosporum.

while c. fulvum contains the complete dothistromin biosynthetic pathway, the toxin is not known to be produced by this fungus, and essentially no expression of dothistromin-biosynthesis related transcripts has been observed in planta or in vitro  <cit> . we probed expression of the predicted r. collo-cygni homologs of dothistromin biosynthesis genes using rt-pcr analysis of in vitro and in planta. expression was assessed in rna extracted from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 20 day old fungal cultures grown in alkyl ester broth  and from barley leaf samples collected from naturally infected field grown plants at two growth stages . ramularia leaf spot symptoms were clearly visible on plants at both growth stages with no significant difference  in disease levels  even though there was significantly less green leaf area retention at gs <dig> . all of the r. collo-cygni homologs of dothistromin biosynthesis genes, including the nine true orthologues and the closest r. collo-cygni gene models to remaining d. septosporum genes, were expressed in at least one of the in vitro time points . rcccypx, rccavfa, rccmoxy, rccaflj, rccordb, rcchypc and rccadha transcripts were expressed in planta at gs <dig> but not at gs <dig> when green leaf area retention had declined, whereas rccpksa, rcchexa and rcchexb were expressed at both in planta growth stages . rccver <dig>  rccdotc, rccaflr, rccvbsa, rccnor <dig>  rccavna/verb and rccest <dig> showed no in planta expression at the time points studied. it will be of interest to ascertain whether or not any of these genes are involved in the production of rubellin or other toxins or secondary metabolites that have important biological functions in r. collo-cygni development or the expression of disease symptoms.

afaflr regulates transcription of most of the genes in the aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster  <cit>  and the d. septosporum dsaflr orthologue regulates expression of genes involved in dothistromin biosynthesis  <cit>  suggesting that aflr-like proteins may act as transcriptional regulators of toxin genes across fungal species. afaflr is located in the middle of the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster adjacent to the divergently transcribed afaflj which has also been shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis  <cit> . in cercospora nicotianae, the aflr-like ctb <dig> and aflj-like ctb <dig> are components of the core cercosporin biosynthetic cluster  <cit> . r. collo-cygni homologs of the regulatory gene dsaflj from the dothistromin alfr/aflj cluster and dsordb, an oxidoreductase, from the dsvbsa cluster were adjacent to each other on contig <dig>  the largest contig in the assembly  containing a putative dothistromin biosynthesis gene homolog . the 40 kb region surrounding rccaflj and rccordb on contig <dig> contained  <dig> gene models and two additional open reading frames , eight of which had significant similarity  to proteins from dothideomycetes . four had matches to proteins with predicted functions including a putative abc transporter, two short chain dehydrogenase/reductases and a scytalone dehydratase, all of which have been reported to have roles in the production of toxins, virulence and/or pathogenicity in dothideomycetes and other fungi .fig.  <dig> a predicted metabolic gene cluster in a 40 kb region on ramularia collo-cygni contig <dig>  putative gene functions based on blastp analysis are indicated below the gene models. where no putative function could be assigned for a gene its function is designated as hypothetical . arrowheads indicate predicted direction of transcription for each open reading frame



the remaining loci were most similar to hypothetical proteins from sequenced genomes, and had protein domain matches to short chain dehydrogenase/reductase, duff <dig>  major facilitator superfamily, glutathione s-transferase and p <dig> superfamily domains. gene model augustus_masked-contig17-processed-gene- <dig> -mrna- <dig> was predicted to encode an aflr-like zn2cys <dig> transcription factor containing gal4-like and aflr domains  <cit> . the biosynthetic roles of the genes on contig <dig> remain to be determined, but all were expressed in barley leaves at gs <dig> showing ramularia leaf spot symptoms whereas only the aldoketoreducatse-like aflb <dig> and mfs-superfamily transporter genes were expressed in diseased tissues at gs <dig> . most of the contig <dig> cluster genes were also expressed between 5– <dig> days during in vitro fungal growth except the p <dig>  aflc and scytalone dehydratase-like genes . expression of many of the genes in this cluster in vitro and during disease symptom development prior to excessive leaf senescence may indicate a role for this cluster in fungal development before r. collo-cygni enters extensive necrotrophic growth. functional analysis of the genes within the cluster on contig <dig> will provide further insights into their biological role.

the high number of pks genes in the genome suggests that r. collo-cygni may be able to produce other toxins in addition to the characterised rubellins . an analysis of gene expression of various r. collo-cygni secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes under differing in vitro and in planta growth conditions will provide valuable insights into the roles these genes play in the biology of this organism. experiments are underway to test whether the predicted orthologues of dothistromin/aflatoxin biosynthesis genes are involved in the production of secondary metabolites including rubellin in r. collo-cygni.

CONCLUSIONS
ramularia leaf spot recently emerged as an important disease of barley in temperate regions across the world. the  <dig>  mb genome of r. collo-cygni was predicted to contain  <dig>  gene models, metrics consistent with the genome size and gene content of other dothideomycetes. phylogenetic analysis as well as observed similarities between r. collo-cygni and z. tritici, p. fijiensis and d. septosporum at the gene level support classification of r. collo-cygni within the mycosphaerellaceae  <cit> . differences between the genomes of these fungi may hold the key to the unique pathology of r. collo-cygni. in particular identifying the fungal genes involved in the transition from endophytic growth to necrotrophy, the biosynthesis of the rubellin toxins and a further understanding of the genetic structure of r. collo-cygni populations  <cit>  are important goals. projects are currently underway within the r. collo-cygni research community to sequence additional genomes from geographically distinct isolates and those collected from non-barley hosts to improve our understanding of how this endophyte has recently established itself as the cause of a newly important foliar disease of barley.
