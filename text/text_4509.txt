BACKGROUND
asteraceae is the largest family of flowering plants in the world. the family includes over  <dig>  genera and  <dig>  individual species. many members of the asteraceae family are important for medicinal, ornamental, and economic purposes.

approximately  <dig> asteraceae species are already used for medicinal purposes in china. for example, artemisia annua and its derivatives are effective in treating malaria  <cit> . saussurea involucrate, an endangered species, possesses anti-fatigue, anti-inflammation, anti-tumor and free radical scavenging properties  <cit> . echinacea also has immuno-modulatory properties with its ability to reduce inflammation, speed up wound healing and boost the immune system in response to bacterial or viral infection  <cit> . commercially important plants of the asteraceae family include the food crops lactuca sativa , cichorium intybus , cynara scolymus , smallanthus sonchifolius , helianthus tuberosus , and so on. aside from consumption, the seeds of helianthus annuus , and those of carthamus tinctorius , another asteraceae member, can be used for the production of cooking oil. other commercially important species of the family asteraceae are members of the tanacetum, chrysanthemum and pulicaria genera, which have insecticidal properties. eupatorium adenophorum is also one of the more noxious invasive plants worldwide, and it does have a significant effect on local ecosystems.

the wide variety of plants in the family asteraceae often makes identification at the species level difficult  <cit> . given the many valuable members of asteraceae described above, an easy and accurate method of authenticating an asteraceae species is indispensable for ensuring the drug and food safety of internationally traded herbs.

dna barcoding is a process that uses a short piece of dna sequence from a standard locus as a species identification tool  <cit> . dna barcode regions have already been adopted for animal use  <cit>  and several regions have previously been recommended for plant use  <cit> . the plant working group of the consortium for the barcode of life  proposed rbcl and matk as the core dna barcodes for plants  <cit> . a previous study by kress et al.  <cit>  tested  <dig> promising barcodes. however, only  <dig> sequences of asteraceae, representing  <dig> species distributed among only  <dig> genera, were analyzed in the study. the cbol plant working group  <cit>  also evaluated the performance of the leading barcoding loci in species identification, but the sequences of asteraceae used included just  <dig> samples, consisting of  <dig> species belonging to  <dig> genera. chen et al.  <cit>  likewise compared the practicality of using the suggested barcode sequences against a large number of medicinal plants. however, the study included no more than  <dig> sequences of asteraceae derived from  <dig> species from  <dig> genera. the researchers did not provide sufficient evidence that the recommended dna barcode regions are suitable for species identification in the family asteraceae, which includes a large number of closely related species. thus, this issue is addressed in our study by comparing the feasibility of using each of these five proposed dna barcodes  in the asteraceae family.

RESULTS
assessment of the universality of the five candidate barcodes
a universal dna barcode is required to be tractable for use in a wide range of species. therefore barcode regions must be relatively short in length to facilitate dna extraction, amplification and sequencing  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  for the selected samples, three regions  were amplified using a single pair of universal primers for each locus that results in high amplification and a sequencing efficiency of 85%. in comparison, its had a relatively lower efficiency at 75%. we used two pairs of matk primers exhibiting different universalities for the members of the family asteraceae. the primers kim3f/1r and 390f/1326r achieved amplifying and sequencing efficiencies of 91% and 25%, respectively.

measurement of inter- versus intra-specific genetic divergence at each locus
six metrics were employed to characterize inter- versus intra-specific variation   <cit> . a favorable barcode should possess a high inter-specific divergence to distinguish different species. its <dig> and its both exhibited significantly higher levels of inter-specific discriminatory ability than psba-trnh and matk. the lowest divergence between conspecific individuals, as determined by all inter-specific calculations was exhibited by rbcl. wilcoxon signed-rank tests affirmed that its <dig> had the highest divergence at the inter-specific level, whereas rbcl had the lowest . the results of the intra-specific differences were similar, with its <dig> contributing the largest and rbcl the smallest variations .

testing the efficacy of authentication
blast <dig> and distance methods were used to test the ability of the potential barcoding sequences in assigning unique species identities to the given samples  <cit> . the results from the two methods revealed a clear pattern , demonstrating that the its region exhibits the highest identification efficiency. its <dig> and its performed well at the genus level using both methods, and at the species level using the distance method. using the blast <dig> method, its <dig> was less efficient  than its at the species level, while rbcl was the lowest performer. in addition, except for the combination of matk and psba-trnh, which improved the correct identification rates by  <dig> %, using one sequence rather than a combination of two markers didn't improve the rates of identification.

the meta-analysis of markers, its, psba-trnh, matk and rbcl, was also performed in parallel with the analysis on its <dig> using genbank data . the correct identification rates were significantly higher for its <dig> than for other markers except its. the genbank data analyses were consistent with our experimental data results. compared with single markers alone, combinations of markers could improve the rate of correct species identification .

overall, our study demonstrates that its <dig> is the most successful region in terms of universality, the specific genetic divergence, and discrimination between species among the five markers examined. its is also proven as a valuable marker for authenticating species in asteraceae. however, its low amplification efficiency limits its potential for broad taxonomic use. although matk, rbcl, and psba-trnh have effective primers for the amplification, the three markers are less powerful than its and its <dig> in species discrimination in the family asteraceae. moreover, theoretically, the regions based on nuclear dna are much more informative than barcodes based on organellar dna  <cit> .

to evaluate further the ability of the its <dig> region to authenticate a wide range of asteraceae species, it was also tested against a larger database that includes  <dig>  samples sequences derived from  <dig>  different species . the its <dig> region performed well, with a  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  successful identification rate at the species level and a  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  successful identification rate at the genus level.

at the species level/
its <dig> is suitable, but not ideal
our research displayed a similar trend to that of chen et al.  <cit>  and demonstrated that its <dig> is a promising barcode for authenticating plant species. in accordance with the criteria outlined by kress et al.  <cit> , the its <dig> region has several advantages that make it a promising candidate for dna barcoding. it has been proposed as a candidate marker for taxonomic classification and barcoding of medicinal plants because it has both high correct identification rate and high amplification efficiency  <cit> . as the its <dig> region is one of the most common regions used for phylogenetic analyses  <cit> , a vast amount of sequencing data has already been deposited in genbank and is ready for immediate use.

the presence of multiple copies of its <dig> sequences is challenging  <cit> . however, coleman  <cit>  proposed that the repeats displayed a high degree of similarity. coleman also suggested that the pcr-amplified copies could represent the information of the its <dig> region in individuals and that its <dig> could be considered a single locus in most cases.

among the six large genera  in the asteraceae family , the utility of its <dig> for species authentication varied and could only be analyzed individually, not as a group. for the genus brachyscome, with  <dig> sequences representing  <dig> species, its <dig> worked well with a  <dig> % successful identification rate. satisfactory results were also obtained for the genus erigeron, where > <dig> % of the sequences were correctly identified. in contrast, its <dig> had lower identification efficiency for the genera centaurea and artemisia . and in two other genera , its <dig> was relatively powerful for taxonomic classification, precisely authenticating  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the samples, respectively. the identification efficiencies of its <dig> in dataset  <dig> are listed in additional file  <dig> .

to improve identification accuracy within a particular genus, using combinations of dna barcodes may be necessary. therefore, its is proposed for use as a complementary barcode for differentiating species within the asteraceae family.

application and meaning of dna barcoding
the selected dna barcode for asteraceae, its <dig>  is not perfect, especially for taxonomists and phylogenetic experts. however, even an imperfect barcode can have a major effect on many areas of research and be sufficient for many applications  <cit> . for instance, its <dig> might be a suitable dna barcode for public users, such as customs officials, forensic examiners, food-processing individuals, and research organizations. considering that its <dig> has a strong ability to group plant samples into their correct genus and has a relatively high accuracy for grouping samples into their correct species, it is of great practical value to individuals without adequate taxonomic training. compared with its <dig>  its or the chloroplast genome is better equipped to deal with the biological complexities of species distinctions, a major focus of taxonomists and phylogenetic experts  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our results support the claim that its <dig> is a valuable locus for differentiating species within asteraceae and that dna barcoding is a useful tool for classification and identification of individual species. we propose applying dna barcoding technology to resolve classification problems in the family asteraceae at the genera and species levels.
