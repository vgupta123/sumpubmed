BACKGROUND
cancer cells harbor a large number of alterations at genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic levels. high-throughput screenings identified hundreds of somatic mutations , thousands of gene and microrna expression changes  and copy number variations , large-scale epigenetic variations  in a typical cancer cell. only a small fraction of these alterations may drive the malignancy of cancers, whereas the majority of them are likely the by-products of chromatin instability and dysregulation of transcriptional/translational apparatus. separation of driver from passenger aberrations is a key question of cancer genomics for its strong implications in prognosis and treatments.

finding the causal and mechanistic links connecting driver aberrations and clinical phenotypes is challenging due to the complexity of the underlying processes. alternatively, molecular phenotypes such as gene expressions are considered. genetic and epigenetic alterations on dnas modulate the expressions and activities of key regulators such as transcription factors and micrornas. dysregulation of these molecules in turn affects a large number of downstream genes. the global gene expression and activity changes then influence clinical phenotypes such as proliferation rates, drug resistance and capability of metastasis.

within the context of mechanisms we modify and extend the definitions of drivers and passengers. a driver is a molecular aberration  that causes variations of gene expressions. a passenger is a protein-coding gene or microrna whose expression is modulated by the driver molecular aberration. notice our definitions of drivers and passengers specify mechanistic/causal relations of genes but do not require information about clinical phenotypes. we term the conventional definitions of drivers and passengers as phenotypic and the extended definitions as mechanistic. a phenotypic driver is usually also a mechanistic driver, since it may affect clinical phenotypes by altering the regulatory programs in cancer cells. conversely, a mechanistic driver may not be a phenotypic driver if the altered passenger genes do not pertain to the clinical phenotypes. similarly, a mechanistic passenger can be a phenotypic driver if the expression change of the gene affects the cancer phenotype.

comprehensive characterization of diverse molecular aberrations in tumors is a major trend of cancer research in the post-genomic era. several international consortia and research institutions have launched large-scale projects to catalog the genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic changes across multiple tumor types. two noted endeavors are the cancer genome atlas   <cit>  and the international cancer genome consortium   <cit> . beyond these coordinated efforts, comprehensive assays on the nci- <dig> cell lines have been performed by distinct research groups over the last two decades .

as large-scale, comprehensive cancer genomic data become more abundant, it is essential to develop computational tools to integrate heterogeneous data in order to acquire a systematic understanding of cancer cells. a rich collection of previous studies attempted to identify the driver mutations responsible for tumorigenesis from cancer genomic data . these studies hypothesized that the driver mutations conferred selective advantages for tumor growth thus occurred in multiple independent instances. accordingly they aimed for finding recurrent aberrations with high frequencies. beyond single genes a variety of computational tools have been proposed to examine the abnormal pathway activities by combining the molecular information of their constituent genes, such as the gene set enrichment analysis  <cit> , principal component analysis  <cit> , factor graph models  <cit> , and others . causal and mechanistic relations of molecular aberrations and gene expressions were not addressed in these studies. some studies tracked the causes of abnormal gene expressions by correlating them with dna copy numbers, gene mutations, dna methylations or microrna expressions . however, these studies were often restricted to pairwise comparisons between two types of data and lacked a unifying framework to integrate multiple types of data in the same model.

beyond cancer data analysis many generic computational models of data integration have been proposed. causal relations were constrained by a variety of properties such as conditional independence of observed variables , molecular interactions and pathways , and data generated from intervention experiments . while many of these tools have been applied to cancer data, most of the questions of interest are phenotype-driven  rather than mechanism-driven .

akavia et al. inferred mechanistic relations of gene expressions and phenotypes in melanoma  <cit> . they identified the gene copy number changes that modulated their own expressions and indirectly affected the expressions of their target genes. curiously, these mechanistic drivers were also phenotypic drivers, as their knock-downs abrogated tumor cell proliferation. despite the value of connecting mechanistic and phenotypic characterization, this study was restricted to copy number variations and discarded other types of molecular aberrations.

recently, we proposed a layered modeling framework for integrative analysis of cancer genomic data  <cit> . the goal was to explain gene expressions with observed molecular aberrations. associations with molecular aberrations were incrementally included according to levels of uncertainty and mechanistic information. in this work, we extended and modified the layered modeling framework to identify association modules of driver molecular aberrations and passenger gene/mircrorna expressions from the integrated datasets of nci- <dig> cell lines. for each type of molecular aberrations, we found the downstream passengers putatively affected by the drivers and regulators mediating the effects from drivers to passengers. the causal relations between drivers/regulators and passengers were supported by both experimental and in-silico validations. the analysis results justify the utility of association modules for other cancer genomic data.

RESULTS
construction of association modules from integrated datasets
diverse molecular aberrations can modulate variations of gene expressions in cancer cells. the dependencies between molecular aberrations and gene expressions may be modular, as multiple genes with coherent expression profiles are likely to be affected by common molecular aberrations. the goal of this study is to find the modules of genes or micrornas whose coherent expression profiles are possibly driven by common molecular aberrations. we define an association module as a tuple consisting of three components: observed driver molecular aberrations, passen-ger genes or micrornas whose expression profiles are associated with driver molecular aberrations, regulators  that mediate the effects between drivers and passengers. we consider the following types of association modules:

 <dig>  cis-acting effects with copy number variations of chromosomal segments. the copy number variation  of a chromosomal segment is associated with the expressions of its constituent genes or micrornas.

 <dig>  trans-acting effects with copy number variations of chromosomal segments. a chromosomal segment cnv possesses cis-acting effects with intermediate regulators on the segment, and both segment cnv and regulator expressions are associated with the expressions of genes or micrornas on other segments.

 <dig>  effects with gene mutations. the mutational state of a gene is associated with the expressions of itself and other genes or micrornas.

 <dig>  effects with dna methylations. the coherent dna methylation state of a collection of genes is negatively associated with the expressions of genes or micrornas.

 <dig>  regulatory effects with micrornas. the coherent expressions of a collection of micrornas are negatively associated with the expressions of a collection of genes.

 <dig>  regulatory effects with transcription factors. the coherent expressions of a collection of transcription factors are associated with the expressions of a collection of other genes.

the association modules are visually summarized in figure  <dig> and elaborated in materials and methods and additional file  <dig>  text s <dig> 

associations between driver aberrations and passenger expressions are established by a series of hypothesis testing procedures using logistic regression models. in brief, an association between a driver and a passenger is selected only if it cannot be replaced by any other association  without a significant loss of the explanatory power. procedures of constructing association modules are described in materials and methods and additional file  <dig>  text s <dig> 

diverse molecular aberrations drive mrna responses in nci- <dig> cell lines
we identified association modules from integrated datasets of nci- <dig> cell lines, including mrna and microrna expressions, copy number variations, mutations, and dna methylations .  <dig> genes possessed coherent expression profiles among three mrna datasets.  <dig> %  of the valid mrna expression profiles were explained by observed molecular aberrations. intriguingly, each type of association modules in figure  <dig> were detected, suggesting diverse molecular mechanisms drive mrna expressions.

summary of mrna association modules
index: module index. reg: intermediate regulators. sign: the functional direction  from drivers to passengers. n: number of passenger genes. intra cnv: intra-segment cnv. inter cnv: inter-segment cnv. tf: transcription factor expressions. the locations of segments are reported in supplementary table s <dig>  mir group  <dig> consists of mir- <dig> mir- <dig> mir-106a,mir 20b,mir- <dig> mir-19b,mir- <dig> mir- <dig> mir- <dig> mir-106b,mir- <dig> mir- <dig> mir- <dig> mir- <dig>  mir group  <dig> consists of mir- <dig> mir-99b,mir-27b,mir- <dig> mir-125a,mir-23b,mir-27a,mir-23a. tf group  <dig> consists of smad <dig> foxd <dig> plau,bdnf,fosl <dig> fosl <dig> rbms <dig>  tf group  <dig> consists of erg,elk <dig> nfatc <dig> rfx <dig> pou5f <dig> znf <dig> 

the credibility of associations between multiple variables was assessed by false discovery rates . we adopted the permutation tests described in  <cit>  as the null model and evaluated two types of fdrs:

 expected # false positives according to the null model#positive calls from the date,# false positives in the 99 percentile of the null model# positive calls from the date table  <dig> shows the fdrs for each type of associations and for all associations together. the fdrs for cis and trans acting effects with segment cnvs are substantially smaller than those for other types of associations. this is sensible as the cis-acting effects with segment cnvs are constrained by chromosomal locations of passenger genes, and the trans-acting effects with segment cnvs are constrained by coherent segment cnvs and expressions of their regulators. in contrast, other types of associations possess no additional constraints beyond driver aberrations and passenger expressions, thus are more likely to be spurious. furthermore, the fdrs calculated from the expected number of false positives are lower than those calculated from the  <dig> percentile of the null distribution. this is also sensible since the latter gives a much more conservative estimate of the false positive numbers. the overall fdrs calculated by these two methods are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

to justify the biological meanings of association modules, we conducted several in-silico validations based on prior literature. first, we extracted putative targets of transcription factors from the transfac database  <cit>  and those of micrornas from three databases . for each association module, we then evaluated the enrichment p-values for the putative targets of their regulators  in the passenger genes. table  <dig> reports the enrichment p-values for the putative targets of regulators in the association modules. among the  <dig> modules whose regulators possess putative target information,  <dig> of them are significantly enriched  with putative targets in their passenger genes. all but one modules containing more than  <dig> passenger genes are enriched with putative targets of their regulators. only one large module - positive associations with apc mutations - is not enriched with the putative targets of the regulator since apc is not a transcription factor and has no binding motifs.

mean: using the expected number of false positives to evaluate fdr. 99%: using the  <dig> percentile of the number of false positives to evaluate fdr. intra cnv: intra-segment cnv. inter cnv: inter-segment cnv. tf: transcription factor expressions. all: the fdr over all associations.

index: module index. reg: the transcription factor or microrna with putative targets. n1: number of passenger genes in a module. n2: total number of putative targets in human genes. n3: number of passenger genes containing the transcription factor binding motif. p-value: hyper-geometric p-value of enrichment. for modules with micrornas as drivers, n2: number of putative targets of a microrna. n3: number of passenger genes belonging to the putative targets of the microrna.

second, we incurred a batch search for all pairs of drivers/regulators and passengers of association modules on ncbi pubmed database and checked whether they were co-cited in previous publications. table  <dig> summarizes the information of co-cited  pairs for each association module. in total,  <dig>  pairs co-occur in the same publications, and  <dig> of  <dig> association modules with non-local aberrations have co-cited  pairs. to assess the significance of co-citations we randomly sampled passenger genes of each module and counted the maximum number of co-cited pairs over  <dig> random trials. among the  <dig> association modules possessing co-cited pairs,  <dig> of them have more than  <dig>  fold of the number of co-cited pairs compared to random samples . the complete co-cited  pairs among all association modules are reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

index: module index. n1: number of passengers in the module. n2: number of co-cited driver/regulator-passenger pairs in the module. n3: max number of co-cited driver/regulator-passengers over  <dig> random modules of the same size. tf group  <dig> consists of smad <dig> foxd <dig> plau,bdnf,fosl <dig> fosl <dig> rbms. tf group  <dig> consists of erg,elk <dig> nfatc <dig> pou5f <dig> znf <dig> 

third, for the passenger genes in each association module we evaluated the enrichment p-values for functional categories  <cit>  and curated pathways . table  <dig> reports representative go categories and pathways.  <dig> of the  <dig> association modules have at least one enriched go category/pathway with p-value ≤  <dig> . the complete list of enriched go categories and pathways are reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>

genes of cis-acting effects with segment cnvs exhibit a clustering tendency
we partitioned the cgh data into  <dig> coherent segments  and examined positive associations between segment cnvs and the mrna expressions of their constituent genes. the cis-acting effects with segment cnvs constitute a substantial portion of the associations with mrna expressions:  <dig> of  <dig> mrna expressions can be explained by the local segment cnvs. these associations are grouped by segments into  <dig> modules. the members of association modules for local segment cnvs are reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  and information about partitioned segments is reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

the passenger genes associated with local segment cnvs are not evenly distributed on chromosomes. figure  <dig> marks the locations of these passenger genes  on each chromosome. the passenger genes associated with local segment cnvs exhibit a clustering tendency. to rule out the possibility that the clustering patterns arise from the distributions of all protein-coding genes on chromosomes, we also marked the locations of passenger genes associated with non-local segment cnvs  in figure  <dig> . despite the presence of dense clusters, the passenger genes with trans-acting effects are more scattered on chromosomes. we evaluated the entropies  of gene densities for cis and trans-acting genes on each chromosome . the trans-acting genes have higher entropies than the cis-acting genes in the majority of the chromosomes, confirming the visual observation about their differences.

trans-acting effects with segment cnvs are mediated by transcription factors
 <dig> mrna expressions are associated with non-local segment cnvs. one possible mechanism to establish these trans-acting associations is through intermediate regulators on segments: segment cnvs have cis-acting effects on the expressions of their constituent regulators, which in turn modulate the expressions of downstream targets on other loci. we identified  <dig> association modules with intermediate regulators and reported them in table  <dig>  module  <dig> has segment  <dig>  as the driver, mitf and zic <dig> as intermediate regulators, and  <dig> passengers. the driver cnv as well as regulator and passenger mrnas all exhibit melanoma-specific elevation in nci- <dig> cell lines . mitf encodes a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation and development of melanocytes and pigment cell-specific transcription of the melanogenesis enzyme genes. zic <dig> encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in brain development. multiple lines of evidence support the associations with mitf in this module. first, amplification of the chromosome 3p region covering mitf is considered as a typical driver mutation in melanoma  <cit> . second, the passenger genes in this module are enriched with experimentally validated mitf targets from  <cit>  , and with genes belonging to the go category of melanosome . third, promoters of passenger genes are also enriched with mitf-binding motifs . fourth, mitf and  <dig> of the  <dig> passenger genes are co-cited in previous publications .

module  <dig> has segment  <dig>  as the driver, myb, tbp and hdac <dig> as intermediate regulators, and  <dig> passengers. the driver cnv as well as regulator and passenger mrnas all exhibit leukemia-specific elevation . myb  is a transcription factor involved in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and differentiation in hematopoiesis. amplifications of this oncogene cause its abnormal expressions in leukemia and other solid tumors  <cit> . tbp is a tata-binding protein belonging to the general transcription apparatus. hdac <dig> is a histone deacetylase that modifies chromatin structures and represses transcription. associations of myb and tbp with the passenger genes are supported by enrichment of their binding motifs on promoters  and co-citations of regulators and passengers in literature . intriguingly, the passenger genes in this module are highly enriched with the go categories or pathways involved in generic dna and rna synthesis such as rna pol ii regulation and chromatin remodeling . the elevated activities of dna and rna synthesis probably reflect high division rates of leukemia: leukemia has the second lowest  average doubling time among the nci- <dig> cell lines  <cit> .

associations do not necessarily imply causality as multiple types of causal structures may yield the same statistical associations  <cit> . we confirmed the causal relations of myb and its associated genes by intervention experiments. we selected  <dig> putative target genes whose mrnas were associated with segment  <dig> cnv and myb expressions in multiple datasets . as a control we selected  <dig> additional genes with high expression levels across all  <dig> cell lines. the k <dig> leukemia cell line was treated with c-myb sirna, and the expression responses of putative myb targets and control genes were measured by qpcr. expressions of  <dig> of  <dig> putative myb targets were down-regulated with the t-test p-value ≤  <dig>  under the c-myb sirna treatment: ctcf, khdrbs <dig>  nfatc <dig>  orc1l, paics, and znf <dig>  and rbmx was significantly up-regulated . in contrast, the control genes were not differentially expressed under the c-myb sirna treatment . the primers and the probe used for detecting each gene are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

module  <dig> has segment  <dig>  as the driver, srebf <dig> and ep <dig> as intermediate regulators, and  <dig> passengers. srebf <dig> encodes a sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor. the srebf2-binding motif is not enriched on the passenger promoters . however, two passenger genes are involved in cholesterol biosynthesis , and the enrichment is significant .

module  <dig> has segment  <dig>  as the driver, e2f <dig>  nfya and srf as intermediate regulators, and  <dig> passengers. the passenger genes are moderately enriched with e2f3-binding motifs , and five  pairs are co-cited in the same studies . srf  is known to regulate raf <dig> , a member of passenger genes  <cit> . moreover, srf and raf <dig> co-participate in multiple signaling pathways including igf <dig>  pdgf, and mapk pathways . srf is also associated with two other passenger genes  in previous studies .

associations with aberrations on individual genes or micrornas reveal the causal relations of their targets
associations with aberrations on individual genes or micrornas provide direct causal explanations for gene expressions.  <dig> mrna expressions are associated with aberrations on individual genes or micrornas - mutations, dna methylations of genes and microrna expressions. they are grouped into  <dig> modules and are reported in table  <dig>  the causal relations between drivers and passengers are supported by previous studies in  <dig> association modules.

positive and negative associations with gene mutations comprise  <dig> mrna expression modules and  <dig> passenger genes. apc encodes a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the wnt signaling pathway and is involved in other processes such as cell migration and adhesion. apc is mutated exclusively in colon cancer cell lines. apc mutations are positively associated with  <dig> passenger genes and negatively associated with  <dig> passenger genes . more previous studies support the positive associations with apc mutations:  <dig> passenger genes are co-cited with apc in previous publications. some of these passenger genes are members or downstream targets of the wnt signaling pathway: bmp <dig>  cd <dig>  cdh <dig>  gpx <dig>  hdac <dig>  pparg, and sox <dig> . mutations of apc activate the wnt pathway thus up-regulate its target genes. other passenger genes are associated with apc aberrations in selected tissue or disease samples: ddr <dig>  dlg <dig>  ets <dig>  hoxa <dig>  itgb <dig>  mest, pla2g4b, sigirr, and spint <dig> . in contrast, only  <dig> negative associations with apc are supported by prior publications. apc and psmd <dig> are in the pathway of β-catenin degradation . apc and cmtm <dig>  exo <dig> and hltf are reported to be hyper-methylated in selected colon cancer samples .

cdkn2a  encodes a tumor suppressor that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  in cell cycle control. it possesses loss-of-function mutations  in  <dig> samples. cdkn2a mutations are negatively associated with  <dig> passenger genes and positively associated with  <dig> passenger genes . three negative associations are supported by previous studies: erbb <dig>  fos and hsd17b <dig> . six positive associations are supported by previous studies: cav <dig>  limk <dig>  msn, thbd, trdmt <dig>  and ywhag . moreover, the positively associated genes are enriched with the go category of cell motility  and signaling pathways of cell motility  and integrin .

tp <dig> encodes a master regulator for apoptosis, cell cycle control and senescence in response to stress conditions. tp <dig> mutations are negatively associated with  <dig> passenger genes and positively associated with  <dig> passenger genes . negative associations are highly enriched with known tp <dig> targets from multiple lines of evidence. first, the passenger genes are enriched with a list of  <dig> known tp53-responsive genes confirmed by chip-seq assays . second, promoters of the passenger genes are enriched with tp53-binding motifs . third,  <dig> of the  <dig> passenger genes are co-cited with tp <dig> in previous publications : bax, ccng <dig>  cdkn1a, ddb <dig>  egfl <dig>  fdxr, gdf <dig>  ltbr, mdm <dig>  tnfrsf10b . most of these co-citations pertain to well-known pathways of tp <dig> regulation. for instance, mdm <dig> is a ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional target of tp <dig>  cdkn1a  is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor and transcriptional target of tp <dig>  bax is a bcl2-associated protein involved in apoptosis. fourth, the passenger genes are enriched with go categories of caspace activation , cyclin-dependent kinase activity , cell cycle arrest , and pathways of tp <dig> signaling , and g2/m checkpoint  . in contrast, positive associations with tp <dig> mutations are not enriched with known tp <dig> targets or promoters containing tp53-binding motifs. negative associations with tp <dig> mutations imply positive regulation of tp <dig> since most tp <dig> mutations are loss-of-function mutations.

 <dig> mrna expressions are negatively associated with dna methylations of five gene clusters . they include the association modules of pax <dig> , bcr , hoxc <dig> , ccnd <dig> and pparg , and col5a <dig> . the passenger genes of pax <dig> and hoxc <dig> modules are enriched with the binding motifs of their drivers . furthermore, a passenger gene in the ccnd1/pparg module, klf <dig>  is regulated by both ccnd <dig> and pparg from multiple previous studies .

 <dig> mrna expressions are negatively associated with two clusters of microrna expressions . association module  <dig> possesses mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-106a, mir-20b, mir- <dig>  mir-19b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-106b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> as drivers and  <dig> passenger genes. association module  <dig> contains mir- <dig>  mir-99b, mir-27b, mir- <dig>  mir-125a, mir-23a, mir-23b, and mir-27a as drivers and  <dig> passenger genes. the passenger genes in both modules are enriched with the predicted targets of their driver micrornas . therefore, some passenger mrna expressions in these modules are probably regulated by their driver micrornas.

gene clusters with coherent expression profiles are likely to be regulated by transcription factors
a unique characteristic of nci- <dig> mrna expression data is the presence of a few large clusters with highly coherent expression profiles . two of the largest clusters are not associated with any observed molecular aberrations. we identified the transcription factors that were associated with the mrna expressions in these clusters as candidates for intermediate regulators. these transcription factors may regulate the coherent expressions of downstream genes, yet the drivers that control the regulator expressions are unknown. two association modules with intermediate regulators are reported in table  <dig>  module  <dig> contains smad <dig>  foxd <dig>  plau, bdnf, fosl <dig>  fosl <dig> and rbms <dig> as regulators and  <dig> passenger genes. module  <dig> contains erg, elk <dig>  nfatc <dig>  rfx <dig>  pou5f <dig> and znf <dig> as regulators and  <dig> passenger genes. the expression profiles of the two modules are shown in figure  <dig> 

associations of regulators and passengers in these modules are supported by rich prior studies. promoters of module  <dig> passengers are highly enriched with smad3-binding motifs . smad <dig> encodes a transcriptional modulator activated by transforming growth factor-β . indeed, many passenger genes are members or downstream targets of the tgfβ signaling pathway according to previous studies, such as tgfbr <dig>  adam <dig>  cav <dig>  ccnb <dig>  and egfr . in addition, many passenger genes are co-cited with other candidate regulators  in previous publications. for instance, associations of bdnf and passenger genes such as adam <dig>  axl, and bcat <dig> in neuron cells are previously reported .

annotations follow table  <dig> 

promoters of module  <dig> passengers are enriched with the binding motifs of nfatc <dig> , pou5f , erg , rfx <dig> , and elk <dig> . many passenger genes are co-cited with some of these regulators in previous studies .

most association modules exhibit tissue-specific expressions
nci- <dig> cell lines constitute  <dig> distinct tissue origins. the patterns of molecular aberrations and gene expressions are likely to vary between tissue types. the inferred modules capture strong associations between drivers and passengers across all samples. strong associations, however, can be manifested by either tissue-specific or tissue-independent patterns. these two types of patterns are illustrated in figure  <dig>  the driver of module  <dig>  is amplified in melanoma cell lines alone, and its passenger expressions are up-regulated in melanoma cell lines. in contrast, the driver of module  <dig>  has prevalent mutations among all tissue types, and its passenger expression patterns are independent of tissue types. to check whether the effects of dysregulation are universal or tissue-specific, we extracted the tissue-specific patterns of drivers and passengers in each module  and visualized them in figure  <dig>  we observed the following intriguing results. first, about half of the cis-acting modules  are coherently up or down regulated in at least one tissue type. in contrast, the majority of the trans-acting modules  have the same property. second, despite many association modules possess tissue-specific patterns, none of them are coherently up or down regulated among all tissue types. in other words, a module has incoherent driver aberrations and passenger expressions in at least one tissue type. third, the tissue-specific patterns are dominated by four tissue types: melanoma, leukemia, colon and central nervous system. for instance,  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> trans-acting modules contain up and down regulated passengers in leukemia respectively.  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> trans-acting modules contain up and down regulated passengers in melanoma respectively.  <dig> trans-acting modules contain differentially expressed passengers in renal cancers. in contrast, very few modules possess tissue-specific patterns on lung, ovarian or prostate cancers. fourth, no module is coherently up or down regulated in breast cancer cell lines. yet several of them possess coherent expressions in estrogen -positive or er-negative samples. for instance, module  <dig>  passengers are up-regulated in er-negative samples and down-regulated in er-positive samples. fifth, tissue-independent patterns belong to transacting modules with external segment cnvs or mutations as drivers. five of  <dig> modules associated with mutations are tissue-independent: module  <dig> , module  <dig> , module  <dig> , module  <dig>  and module  <dig> . the mutational states of these genes on the samples are not aligned with their tissue types. in contrast, modules associated with mutations of apc and braf possess tissue-specific patterns, as apc and braf mutations occur primarily on colon cancer and melanoma samples respectively. similarly, the majority of microrna association modules possess tissue-specific patterns, and these patterns are dominated by up/down regulations in leukemias, central nervous systems and colons. different from mrna modules, only two microrna modules possess melanoma-specific patterns. the tissue-specific patterns of microrna modules are displayed in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> 

microrna expressions are driven by distinct aberration mechanisms from mrna expressions
 <dig> of  <dig> microrna expressions are associated with observed molecular aberrations. we grouped these associations into  <dig> modules and summarized their information in table  <dig>  intriguingly, the drivers of the top-ranking microrna modules are marginally overlapped with those of the top-ranking mrna modules, suggesting that microrna and mrna expressions are driven by distinct molecular aberrations. the complete list of association modules are reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  and driver aberrations and passenger microrna expressions are visualized in additional file  <dig>  figures s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> 

information about regulators and functions of micrornas is much more scattered than those of protein-coding genes. we incurred a batch search on pubmed to identify co-citations of drivers/regulators and passenger micrornas in these modules. overall, co-citations of drivers/regulators and passengers were found in  <dig> associations modules. table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> report the co-citation outcomes for microrna modules.

cis-acting effects with segment cnvs are absent on micrornas
a remarkable distinction between mi-crorna and mrna associations is the lack of associations with local segment cnvs in microrna modules. mi-crorna expressions are poorly correlated with their local segment cnvs compared to mrna expressions . the only possible exception is a module of micrornas located on chromosome 14p . these micrornas exhibit a coherent expression pattern  and are localized on chromosome 14p. thus they are likely to be modulated by local segment cnvs. yet we cannot verify these associations since chromosome 14p is not covered by the cnv data.

associations suggest the existence of feedback loops between micrornas and protein-coding genes
co-citation search outcomes demonstrate bidirectional regulatory links between the driver/regulator genes and passenger mircrornas. table  <dig> summarizes these regulatory links reported from prior studies. most drivers/regulators of these microrna modules are known or predicted targets of the passenger micrornas. hence there are possible bidirectional links connecting transcription factors and micrornas. in some cases, bidirectional links are reported. for instance, map2k <dig> in module  <dig> is both a known regulator and target of two passenger micrornas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  similarly, tp <dig> in module  <dig> is both a known regulator and target of two passenger micrornas mir-15a and mir- <dig>

discussion
uncovering causal relations of genes from static, observational data alone is challenging due to the ambiguities of transferring associations into causal information. we address this problem by exploiting two widely accepted hypotheses in cancer genomics: molecular aberrations on dnas  affect the levels of rna transcripts but not the other way around, if both cis-acting and trans-acting effects of segment cnvs are detected, then cis-acting effects are more likely to be the direct causes for expression changes. based on these hypotheses we built association modules between putative driver molecular aberrations and passenger mrna or microrna gene expressions. our predictions are supported by various validation results. first, the downstream targets of several well-known cancer-related genes such as mitf, tp <dig> and apc are retrieved from our association modules. second, the passenger genes of large modules are enriched with the putative targets of their regulators or drivers. third, putative targets of myb are down-regulated under the myb sirna treatment. fourth, associations between molecular aberrations and microrna expressions reveal the bidirectional regulatory links between transcription factors and micrornas.

one intriguing observation is that each type of molecular aberrations participate in at least one association module. therefore, to track the causes of expression variations it is necessary to interrogate multiple types of molecular aberrations concurrently. nci- <dig> datasets are sparse in mutations , copy number variations  and dna methylations . consequently, about half of the mrna expression data  are not significantly associated with observed aberrations. this drawback will become less prominent in new generations of comprehensive cancer genomics projects , as they employ high density microarrays and next-generation sequencing to cover the entire genomes.

associations with driver molecular aberrations can be extended to clinically relevant phenotypes such as drug resistance  <cit> . unlike mrna or microrna expressions, these phenotypes are not the direct products of molecular aberrations. thus associations are likely to be mediated by the genes functionally related to the phenotypes. for instance, from the drug response data on nci- <dig> cell lines  <cit>  we found leukemia cell lines were sensitive to the majority of compounds tested . this observation coincides with up-regulation of genes involved in transcriptional and translational processes in leukemia . both drug responses and gene expressions reflect the high growth and division rates of leukemia cell lines relative to other samples.

two of the largest association modules  lack driver aberrations but consist of intermediate regulators. in particular, multiple lines of evidence indicate the expressions of module  <dig> are controlled by tgfβ pathway activities. yet it is unclear which molecular aberrations modulate the expressions of the intermediate regulators. examination of the mutations and dna methylations of members on the tgfβ pathway may reveal their driver aberrations.

cis-acting and trans-acting effects with segment cnvs dominate the association modules of mrna expressions . amplifications and deletions of chromosomal segments are powerful driver aberrations, as they can possibly affect many genes on the segments and downstream targets on other loci. determination of cis-acting and trans-acting effects with cnvs remains an open problem. we observed a tendency of cis-acting genes to cluster on certain hot-regions of chromosomes. yet many cis-acting genes are still scattered around the entire chromosomes. the distributions of cis and trans-acting genes will become more clear from the data of high density cgh arrays.

associations with mutations of several cancer-related genes - tp <dig>  cdkn2a, apc - are largely consistent with their known targets. however, the passenger sets of positive and negative associations exhibit differential levels of enrichment. passenger genes negatively associated with tp <dig> mutations  are enriched with tp53-binding motifs  and known targets of tp <dig> . in contrast, passenger genes positively associated with tp <dig> mutations  do not possess the enrichment. tp <dig> undergoes loss-of-function mutations, thus negative associations imply positive regulation between tp <dig> and its targets. although negative regulation of tp <dig> has been previously reported  <cit> , on nci- <dig> tp <dig> seems to be an activator of its prominent direct targets. the enriched functional information is reversed in apc and cdkn2a mutations.  <dig> of the passenger genes positively associated with apc mutations  are involved in the wnt pathway or associated with apc. in contrast, only  <dig> of the passenger genes negative associated with apc mutations  are related to apc. similarly,  <dig> of the passenger genes positively associated with cdkn2a mutations  are related to cdkn2a, whereas only  <dig> of the passenger genes negatively associated with cdkn2a mutations  are related to cdkn2a. unlike tp <dig>  apc and cdkn2a are inhibitors of signaling pathways  and possess no direct targets. hence their loss-of-function mutations would activate the downstream targets of the pathways. in contrast, genes down-regulated in apc or cdkn2a mutants are likely to arise from secondary effects instead of direct consequences of apc or cdkn2a mutations.

two large clusters of mrna expressions are negatively associated with groups of microrna expressions . the causality between micrornas and mrnas are ambiguous since regulation can take place in both directions. the passenger genes are enriched with the predicted targets of driver micrornas. additional evidence is required to determine their causal directions.

in nci- <dig> cell lines, microrna and mrna expressions seem to be driven by distinct molecular aberrations. unlike mrna expression modules, none of the microrna expression modules are associated with local segment cnvs. this is curious since many micrornas in this study are located on the partitioned segments and between the protein-coding genes possessing the cis-acting effects with segment cnvs. poor correlations between microrna expressions and their local segment cnvs suggest either the low resolution of the cgh data or the trans-acting nature of microrna regulation.

it is more difficult to validate the association modules of microrna expressions due to the paucity of regulatory and functional information. intriguingly, we found that many drivers and regulators were known or predicted targets of their passenger micrornas . in some cases, regulation along both directions between drivers and passengers is reported . the association outcomes and prior studies suggest feedback regulation between driver transcription factors and passenger micrornas.

it is worth noting that pairwise associations inferred from the data are projections of multi-variate models from drivers to the target passenger. a driver links to a passenger if their association cannot be explained by other driver variables. therefore, "pairwise associations" in this study carry a very different meaning from purely pairwise scores such as correlation coefficients. a more adequate analogy is conditional independence in probabilistic graphical models. a driver a links to a passenger x if a is not conditionally independent of x given any other driver variable. such direct and indirect relations can be captured by a variety of prior approaches such as bayesian networks, mutual information and regression. our contribution is not to invent/introduce a new mathematical tool to tackle the same problem, but to develop a data integration framework to exploit the statistical and mechanistic properties of the data. more specifically, the novelty of this work includes prioritize the order of adding association links according to mechanistic information. cis-acting effects are first considered as they provide direct explanation for passenger expression fluctuations. trans-acting effects with aberrations on dna as drivers  are taken into account only if they provide additional explanatory power relative to cis-acting effects. finally, trans-acting effects without dna aberrations  are introduced on top of the lower layered models. project the complex network of conditional independence relations onto pairwise links and group these links as driver-centric association modules. this simplification is useful and practical as it is much easier to examine and validate a coherent module than a complex network.

projecting a complex regulatory network onto well-structured modules certainly yields information loss. genes are often regulated by combinatorial interactions of multiple transcription factors, chromatin modifiers and signaling proteins. moreover, the regulatory programs may vary with tissue types. in this work, we chose to ignore combinatorial interactions and tissue-specific regulatory programs and focused on strong marginal effects manifested on the variations across all  <dig> cell lines. this simplification seems necessary given the limited size of nci- <dig> data. a new generation of cancer genomic data - such as tcga and icgc - often cover much more patients with a specific tumor type. therefore, it is possible to include the combinatorial interactions and tissue-specific regulations in an extension of the current models.

the fdr values clearly depend on the constraints of associations. internal segment cnvs require the physical proximity of drivers and passengers, and external segment cnvs require the existence of intermediate regulators linking segment cnvs and passenger expressions. these additional constraints push the fdrs below significant levels. in contrast, modules of mutations, dna methylations, microrna and tf expressions as drivers rely only on associations between drivers and passengers. thus their fdrs are substantially higher than standard significant values. to lower the fdrs on those modules, additional constraints such as evidence of physical interactions between drivers and passengers are probably needed. however, since the fdrs reported in table  <dig> are the aggregate results over all modules of the same type, the high values do not deteriorate the relevance of individual modules. for instance, multiple lines of evidence support the modules associated with tp <dig> mutations, cdkn2a mutations, pax <dig> methylations, as well as tf groups  <dig> and  <dig> expressions. it is difficult to discriminate these biologically relevant modules from potentially spurious modules from the nci- <dig> data alone. external information or experimental validation has to be incorporated. in this work, we use external information and experimental validation to justify the models inferred from data alone. a refined version of the model construction algorithm should include these additional information in the loop.

only  <dig> transcription factor binding motifs are significantly enriched on module passengers after bonferroni correction . these unsatisfactory results can be attributed to both the conservative nature of bonferroni correction and the accuracy of motif presence as a proxy for regulation. we sought the presence of motifs within 5kb upstreams of the transcription start sites. this simple scheme may create many false positives and false negatives. for instance, only  <dig> of the  <dig> experimentally validated mitf targets  <cit>  contain the mitf-binding motif within 5kb promoters, and only  <dig> of the  <dig> experimentally validated tp <dig> targets  <cit>  contain the tp53-binding motif within 5kb promoters. the discrepancy between motif presence and experimentally validated targets may partially explain the relatively high motif enrichment p-values of modules  <dig>  and  <dig> . restrictions to promoters with multiple motif occurrences reduce false positives but increase false negatives. the enrichment results are worse than table  <dig> . consequently, we should treat motif enrichment analysis as one error-prone validation and use it together with other validations . other types of validations are also subjected to error. it remains an open problem to systematically validate the large-scale models inferred from high-throughput data.

in this work, we built association modules from nci- <dig> data alone and attempted to validate the inferred modules with external information. an alternative and common approach is to start with prior models using external information  and learn the models explained by the data. as a simple comparison, we treated each pathway and go category as the passenger gene set of a module and identified the drivers that significantly explained their expressions. the results are reported in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  overall, only a small number of go categories and pathways are significantly explained by driver aberrations in nci- <dig> data. prominent ones include genes involved in melanosome and melanin biosynthesis and explained by mitf transcription factor expressions, ribosome genes explained by a cluster of  <dig> micrornas, and members of proteasome genes explained by internal segment cnvs on chromosome 14q. notice that genes involved in melanosome and melanin biosynthesis substantially overlap with module  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed a computational method to build associations between molecular aberrations  and mrna/microrna expressions  and grouped the genes/micrornas into modules according to their associated molecular aberrations. intriguingly, a considerable portion of these associations implied causal relations according to in-silico and experimental validations. we found passengers in these association modules were enriched with the putative targets of the drivers, functional categories and pathways in which the drivers were involved, and regulatory/association links confirmed by prior publications. moreover, we demonstrated that the predicted myb targets were down-regulated in a myb-sirna treated leukemia cell line. the reported association modules indicated that gene/microrna expressions in cancer were driven by diverse aberration mechanisms including copy number variations, mutations, dna methylations, microrna and transcription factor expressions. in addition, the results suggested distinct driver mechanisms between mrna and microrna expressions and the existence of bidirectional regulatory links between micrornas and transcription factors.
