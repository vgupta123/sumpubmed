BACKGROUND
reproduction, particularly female reproductive performance, is one of the most important components in livestock production. litter size at weaning  has been considered as one of the most important reproduction traits in pig production  <cit> . in practical pig breeding, selection for total number of piglets born  was introduced in the early eighties in danish landrace and yorkshire populations to improve lsw  <cit> . unfortunately, this approach led to an increase in piglet mortality . in  <dig> the breeding goal in the danish breeding program was changed to focus on the litter size at five days after farrowing , and as result the mortality of piglets prenatally and in the early nursing period has decreased  <cit> .

the genetic basis of reproductive performance is complicated because of the complex and quantitative nature of the traits. using modern molecular information, many linkage  and candidate gene studies  <cit>  have been conducted to find the quantitative trait loci  and causal genes for these traits. more recently, the availability of high throughput genotyping makes it possible to study the genetic architectures and the genetic relationships of reproduction traits in pigs in further detail.

based on the high-density panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms , genome-wide association studies  have been developed to identify dna variants associated with complex diseases and traits in humans and other animals  <cit> . gwas has become a widely accepted approach to investigate genetic architectures of economically important traits in livestock. many previous studies have carried out gwas for complex traits in pig, such as teat number, androstenone and skatole levels, boar taint, backfat, loin muscle area, body conformation and brown coat color, and detected many qtls for these traits . detection of qtl regions and genes affecting pig reproductive traits would be helpful for further understanding of these traits and genetic improvement of pig reproduction, but only few studies of reproductive traits have been made  <cit> .

various approaches, such as single-marker tests  <cit> , linear mixed model analysis  <cit> , haplotype models and genealogy based mixed-models  <cit> , bayesian variable selection models  <cit> , least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  <cit>  have been proposed for gwas. in previous model comparison studies, linear mixed model and bayesian variable selection models were shown better than other methods in terms of detection power  <cit> . the linear mixed model, which is based on regression of phenotypes on snp genotypes, is easy to implement. each single marker is analyzed separately by using a linear model, which creates multiple testing problems as a large numbers of tests of snp markers throughout the entire genome are performed. a multiple-testing problem which can lead to a high rate of type i errors could be created. thus, a bonferroni correction is often applied to set stringent thresholds on p values in order to avoid this problem, but this could result in poor statistical power. besides, when many snps are in strong ld with one qtl, the use of a linear model makes it difficult to identify which snp within a broad genomic region causally influences the complex trait and it is also troublesome to separate neighboring qtls, which may contribute to the same peak. in addition, the linear model is also known for being sensitive for population and family structures, thus mixed models correcting for these effects are needed, either by adding pedigree or markers  <cit> . therefore, it is appealing to apply bayesian variable selection models, which simultaneously fit multiple marker effects, avoid multiple testing, and can implicitly correct for the structure  <cit> . additionally, the power to detect significant genetic association may be considerably enhanced by simultaneous modeling of markers. however, simultaneously fitting of snp markers usually leads to low posterior probability for each snp, in which case the sum of posterior probability of snps in a qtl region could be a better alternative option  <cit> . however, the sum of posterior probability of snps in a qtl region could be larger than  <dig> and it overestimates the posterior probability of a region.

therefore, the objective of the current study was to identify qtl for the litter size and piglet mortality based on data from the porcinesnp <dig> beadchip in danish landrace and yorkshire pigs. the performance of a bayesian mixture model was compared with a linear mixed model and a novel method was proposed to detect qtl regions.

methods
data
the data from breeding herds and multiplier herds were supplied by danish pig research centre, seges p/s. animal care and use committee approval was not applicable for this study because the data were obtained from an existing database of pig breeding. corrected phenotypes  of tnb, ls <dig> and mortality rate before day  <dig>  were defined as original observations adjusted for effects of herd-year-season, parity, month at farrowing, hybrid indicator, age at first farrowing, parity-correction, farrowing interval, and artificial insemination. this methodology has previously been described by guo et al.  <cit> , in which litters of  <dig>  landrace and  <dig>  yorkshire pigs were used. in the present study, however, the populations used for computing yc of both sows and boars were extended to younger generations by including additional litters of  <dig>  landrace and  <dig>  yorkshire sows.

genotyping was done using the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip  or imputed from the  <dig>  k ggp-porcine ld illumina bead snp chip. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp markers for landrace and yorkshire pigs, respectively, met the following requirements. each marker had a minor-allele frequency greater than  <dig> , a call-frequency score greater than  <dig> , average gencall score larger than  <dig> , no strong deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium , and known position on build  <dig>  assembly . in addition, the animals with call rate less than  <dig>  were excluded from the analysis. the imputation for lower density chips as well as sporadic missing genotypes were performed by using beagle version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

finally, yc of tnb, ls <dig> and mort for  <dig>  genotyped landrace pigs  and  <dig>  genotyped yorkshire pigs  born from  <dig> to  <dig> were used for the analysis . additional genotypes of  <dig>  landrace pigs  and  <dig>  yorkshire pigs  were added in this study, due to data updating.

statistical models
a linear mixed model and a bayesian mixture model were used to perform gwas in danish landrace and yorkshire pigs separately to detect significant qtl associated with the three traits.

linear mixed model 
the lm model  <cit>  used in this study was a single snp regression model. the model included a fixed regression of phenotypes on genotypes of a given snp, and in addition, a random polygenic effect accounting for shared genetic effects of related individuals. the lm model was:  yc=1μ+xg+zu+e, where yc was the vector of yc values of tnb, ls <dig> or mort, μ was the overall mean,  <dig> was a vector of ones, g was the additive genetic effect of a snp, x was a vector of the snp genotypes coded as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for genotypes a1a <dig>  a1a <dig> and a2a <dig> respectively, u was a vector of random polygenic effects, z was an incidence matrix relating yc to the corresponding random polygenic effects, and e was a vector of residual effects. it was assumed that u~n <dig> aσu <dig> where a was the pedigree-based additive relationship matrix and σu <dig> was the variance of residual polygenic effect, and e~n <dig> dσe <dig>  where σe <dig> was the residual variance and d was a diagonal matrix containing the elements dii = 1/wi where wi was weight of yc indicating the reliability of yc. the weight of yc was calculated based on the reliability of yc and as described in a previous study  <cit> .

significance test of snp effects was performed using a two-sided t-test. a bonferroni correction was applied to control false positive associations in a multiple comparison procedure. thus, the significant level was defined as p <  <dig> /n , where n was the number of snp loci analyzed. therefore, the significant threshold value of − log <dig> were  <dig>   and  <dig>   for landrace and yorkshire, respectively. analysis of the lm model was performed by using the dmu package  <cit> .

bayesian mixture model 
the bm model  <cit>  used in the current study assumed snp effects to follow a mixture distribution and estimated the effects of all snps simultaneously. the bm model was:  yc=1μ+∑j=1mxjgj+zu+e,  where yc,  <dig>  μ, z, u and e were defined as in the lm model. the term ∑j=1mxjgj fitted additive effects of all snps, xj was the vector of snpj genotypes, and gj was the effect of snpj. it was assumed that most markers had small effects and a few markers had large effects. accordingly, the prior mixture distribution of gj was:  gj~n0σg02n0σg12withprobabilityπ0withprobabilityπ1=1−π <dig>   where n denoted normal distribution, π <dig> was the probability of the snp having a small effect and π <dig> was the probability of the snp having a large effect. it was assumed that the prior distribution of π <dig> and π <dig> was a beta distribution with beta . besides, it was assumed that priors of μ and σg <dig> followed uniform distributions, and σg12=σg02× <dig>  by assuming a small variance instead of  <dig> for the distribution of n0σg <dig>  the implementation of markov chain monte carlo  was straightforward with recognizable conditional distributions for all model parameters  <cit> . each of the bayesian analyses was run as a single chain with a total length of  <dig>  markov chain samples by gibbs sampling, with the first  <dig>  cycles discarded as burn-in. afterwards, every 20th sample of the remaining  <dig>  was saved for posterior analysis. analysis of the bm model was performed by using the bayz package  <cit> .

qtl region based on bm
the qtl region was detected by using a novel post-gibbs analysis which was based on the mcmc samples. first, each chromosome was divided into many small sliding windows of equal length  and a posterior probability of interval  was calculated according to the saved mcmc samples of all the markers in each window. in each window, ppint was defined as the proportion of samples where at least one snp within the window was falling into the second distribution  to total number of samples. secondly, the peaks including windows with ppint higher than the significant threshold  were chosen as candidate peaks to be further analyzed. in this study, the threshold of  <dig>  was chosen. the threshold can be chosen by the investigator and directly reflect the posterior probability of a qtl in the region. finally, the window with highest ppint in each candidate peak was chosen as the qtl region. the genetic variance explained by a qtl region was computed as varxregionbregiont, which was the variance at the cycle t explained by the region and then the posterior mean and standard deviation were obtained.

analysis of qtl regions
the bm model was used to test all snps simultaneously. three sets of length,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb of sliding windows were tested. a new method of detecting qtl region by using a bayesian post-gibbs analysis was proposed. the patterns of ppint for  <dig>  mb sliding window are shown in the right side of fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the number of qtl regions detected for each chromosome in different scenarios and more details of these regions are presented on the supplementary material . qtl regions were detected for all the traits in both breeds except mort in yorkshire for which no significant region was detected. the narrowest region among the three window sizes was chosen as the qtl region for each trait. within these regions annotated genes were compared for their function. the positions and lengths of qtl regions, the genetic variance accounted by qtl regions as well as the related genes were listed in table  <dig>  for tnb in landrace, when using  <dig>  mb as the length of sliding windows, three qtl regions were detected with two located on ssc <dig> and one on ssc <dig> . the two regions on ssc <dig> explained  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of additive genetic variance and the one on ssc <dig> explained  <dig>  %. when the length of window was increased to  <dig>  mb, three more qtl regions located on ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> were detected and they explained  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of additive genetic variance, respectively. the number of qtl regions did not increase further when the length of windows were expanded to  <dig>  mb. for ls <dig> in landrace, the number of qtl regions increased from one  to three  when the length of window increased from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, and further increased to four  when using windows of length  <dig>  mb . the proportions of additive genetic variance explained by the regions on ssc <dig> , ssc <dig> , ssc <dig>  and ssc <dig>  were  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. for mort in landrace, only one region on ssc <dig> was detected when using  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb windows, and one more on ssc <dig> was detected when window amplified to  <dig>  mb . the  <dig>  mb region on ssc <dig> explained  <dig>  % of additive genetic variance and the  <dig>  mb region on ssc <dig> explained  <dig>  %. for tnb in yorkshire, one region on ssc <dig> was detected when using  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb windows  and the  <dig>  mb region explained  <dig>  % of the additive genetic variance, and one more on ssc <dig> was detected when windows were expanded to  <dig>  mb which explained  <dig>  % of the additive genetic variance. however, only one qtl region on ssc <dig> was detected for ls <dig> in yorkshire, no matter which window length was used  and the  <dig>  mb region explained  <dig>  % of the additive genetic variance.table  <dig> chromosome  of qtl regions detected using posterior probability in different length of windows

discussion
this study performed gwas for litter size and mortality traits in danish pigs. two models, a linear model and a bayesian mixture model, were used for the analysis. many snps were detected to be significantly associated with the traits of interests. in addition, a novel approach to identify the qtl region was proposed. in total,  <dig> qtl regions were detected for tnb, ls <dig> and mort in danish landrace and yorkshire pigs.

gwas using lm and bm
the association patterns between markers and traits of interests were generally similar between the two models applied in the current study. among  <dig> qtl regions identified by using bm,  <dig> regions embraced snps detected had significant association with traits of interests using lm. however the detection signals were more distinct when using bm than lm. the clearer peaks indicate that the bm model is better at identifying and distinguishing regions of putative qtl.

population stratifications were investigated by calculating lambda-values  <cit> . the lambda-values found for landrace were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   for yorkshire. the lm used in the current study implemented a polygenic component, based on the additive-relationship matrix, as an attempt to control the population stratifications. however, according to the lambda-values, the lm used could not control the population stratifications completely. the use of bm to fit all markers simultaneously in the model makes it possible to control the population stratifications  <cit> .

although the patterns of associations when using lm and bm models were generally consistent, some differences were observed. it was observed that many snps on ssc <dig> were detected significantly associated with most of the traits by using lm, while the bm model did not led to similar results, though there were some tentative peaks. the reason for the large amount of significant snps scattered across most of ssc <dig> when using lm is most likely assembly and map errors. the linkage disequilibrium  pattern between significant snps was investigated. strong ld was found between blocks of snps far away from each other and low ld was detected within block on ssc <dig>  when compared with other chromosomes, ssc <dig> in both landrace and yorkshire showed several clear regions with strong ld between the snps within a region. however, the snps in ld with each other dispersed across the whole chromosome on ssc <dig>  when snps in strong ld with a causal gene are wrongly mapped, lm may lead to peaks in the wrong location, while bm may not detect the qtl region because all markers are simultaneously fitted, which may make the ppint of a region small if the snps in the region are wrongly mapped. when some assembly and map errors exist, lm and bm will lead to different results. in addition, the population stratifications could be another reason for the large amount of significant snps on ssc <dig> when lm was used. for ssc <dig>  the lambda-values were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   for landrace, and  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   for yorkshire. the lambda-values for ssc <dig> deviated more from  <dig> compared with the whole genome. however, when using bm, most of the significant snps detected by lm disappeared, which could also be due to good control of population stratifications by bm.

the differences in some significant chromosome segments between the two models can be explained by the different operation mechanism of models. when using lm, a single-locus regression analysis was performed, in which one snp was fitted and a qtl effect was explained by a single snp in each analysis. therefore, a number of snps in ld with the qtl will generally present significant effects. in contrast, the bm model estimates the effects of all snps simultaneously. therefore a qtl effect might be represented either by a single snp or distributed over several snps that were in strong ld with the qtl. in other words, the effect of the single qtl could be represented by several markers jointly  <cit> . since all the snps were fitted in the model simultaneously when using bm, a statistic across a small region is a good criterion to detect the qtl region instead of a single snp.

regardless of the different models, the amount of significant snps and regions detected in yorkshire pigs was smaller than in landrace. also, heritabilities and genetic variances of the traits were higher for landrace than for yorkshire. lastly, reliability of yc for landrace is higher than for yorkshire, due to the larger data set available for landrace. these results indicate that qtl detection power was higher for landrace than for yorkshire.

qtl regions
detection of qtl regions was based on the results from mcmc sampling. the ppint represented the probability of large effect snps included in each window. the window with highest ppint in each significant peak was chosen as a qtl region. three sets of sliding windows with length of  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, were tested to detect qtl regions. the number of qtl regions was generally increased when increasing the window length, at the cost of achieving a broad interval. the optimal window size may differ between studies or even among different qtl in the same study depending on the extent of ld between markers and qtl, the effect size, as well as the power of detection. in this study, ten window sizes were tested as a preliminary investigation in order to choose an appropriate size of sliding window to report . the ten window sizes varied from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, with the increment of  <dig>  mb. when using the  <dig>  mb, most of the sliding windows presented a low ppint and the peaks were confounded with the background. however, when the window size varied from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb and from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, the patterns of different scenarios could be generally represented by  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively. lastly, the ppint showed no significant changes when the window was enlarged to  <dig>  mb. as regard to the balance of detection power and positioning of qtl, sliding window with  <dig>  mb was good to locate qtl in a narrow region,  <dig>  mb was appropriate to locate qtl with higher detection power, while  <dig>  mb could be the upper limit to define a qtl region because the ppint for a window larger than  <dig>  mb did not increase . in general, there is no need to increase size of window when the ppint no longer increase with the increasing of window size.

all the qtl regions detected for tnb, ls <dig> and mort in the current study overlapped with previously reported qtl regions associated with reproduction in pigs which can be found in table  <dig>  the qtl regions reported in previous studies were mainly associated with corpus luteum number , teat number  <cit> , non-functional nipples  <cit> , age at puberty  <cit> , litter weight  <cit>  and embryo weight  <cit> . all of these traits are relevant for litter size or piglet mortality. for example, the corpus luteum is essential for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in pigs  <cit> . progesterone secreted by corpus luteum is a steroid hormone responsible for the decidualization of the endometrium and maintenance. besides, genetic association between teat number and litter traits was investigated where a high number of non-functional teats was found genetically associated with more stillborn piglets  <cit> .table  <dig> the qtl regions detected in current study overlapped with previously reported ones

in addition, some of the qtl regions reported in previous studies were specifically associated with litter size and mortality traits. for example, the qtl region located on ssc <dig> identified for tnb overlapped with the regions previously reported for tnb and total number born alive  <cit> . the qtl regions located on ssc <dig> identified for tnb and mort overlapped with the regions reported for tnb and mummified pigs  <cit> . the qtl regions located on ssc <dig> identified for ls <dig> and mort overlapped with the regions reported for tnb and total number born alive  <cit> . and the qtl regions located on ssc <dig> identified for tnb and ls <dig> overlapped with the region reported for tnb  <cit> .

the overlap of qtl regions identified in this study with the regions reported in previous studies provides more confidence about the qtl regions detected.

candidate genes for reproduction traits
some known genes were present on the qtl regions detected in this study, as it can be seen in table  <dig>  it was observed that most of the qtl regions cover a number of genes even though the region was narrow, e.g. the regions on ssc <dig> for tnb in landrace. therefore, pinpointing a specific candidate gene for such a qtl region is hard. other regions cover one or two genes only, e.g. the region on ssc <dig> detected for tnb and ls <dig> in landrace. this region only include the gene hairy and enhancer of split- <dig> . hes <dig> has been found to be involved in the maintenance of certain stem cells and progenitor cells, specifically influencing the timing of differentiation and determining binary cell fate. it has been shown that hes <dig> is playing a large role in both the nervous and digestive systems in mice  <cit> . another qtl region on ssc <dig> for tnb in yorkshire included karyopherin alpha  <dig> . kpna <dig>  a member of the karyopherin α family of transport receptors, was first reported in cattle and was shown to be exclusively expressed in ovarian tissues, oocytes and cleavage stage embryos. rnai-mediated knockdown of kpna <dig> in bovine embryos lead to defects in cleavage development  <cit> . in addition, it was also reported that kpna <dig> predominately expressed in porcine oocytes and early cleavage stage embryos, which suggests the requirement of kpna <dig> for cleavage development  <cit> . both hes <dig> and kpna <dig> could be related with reproduction traits according to their function.

though it is hard to pinpoint a specific candidate gene for qtl regions embracing several genes, these genes could influence a certain trait in a joint manner. among the genes located on the detected qtl regions, many can be clustered in the group involved in process of cell growth, cell development, cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation and immune response etc. some of the genes also have been reported in relation to specific reproduction processes. for example, the protein coded by sperm equatorial segment protein  <dig>  located on ssc <dig>  is an acrosome membrane protein involved in sperm-egg binding and fusion  <cit> . the expression of spesp <dig> has also been reported to be involved in the sperm–oocyte binding and fusion in pigs  <cit> . in addition, growth differentiation factor  <dig>  on ssc <dig> was the first oocyte-derived growth factor identified to be required for ovarian somatic cell function  <cit> . the gdf <dig> null mice were incapable of ovulation as a result of an arrest of follicle development at the primary stage, which indicated the essential role of gdf <dig> in folliculogenesis  <cit> . the expression of gdf <dig> was also investigated in pigs where expression of gdf <dig> was higher in oocytes than in cumulus/granulosa cells  <cit> .

among all the regions detected, the qtl region on ssc <dig> was commonly detected for tnb in both landrace and yorkshire. this region had positive effects on tnb in both breeds and the snp located on  <dig> , <dig> had relatively large effect which was found in the intron of the gene kpna <dig>  therefore, this region and the kpna <dig> gene could be good resource for across-breed selection. another region located on ssc <dig> was commonly detected for ls <dig> and mort in landrace, while direction of the effects were opposite for these two traits. the effect of this qtl region was positive for ls <dig> but negative for mort. the opposite effects of this region on ls <dig> and mort could be part of the reason that negative genetic correlation between ls <dig> and mort observed in danish pigs  <cit> . as reported by previous studies, selection for tnb is generally associated with an increase of piglet mortality  <cit> . accordingly, the danish breeding program changed breeding goal from selection for tnb to ls <dig> in  <dig>  which has led to an increase in lsw and a decrease of piglet mortality  <cit> . the opposite effects of this region on these two traits also suggested the selection of ls <dig> is efficient to reduce mort. there were some genes, e.g. high mobility group at-hook  <dig> , nudix -type motif  <dig> , ribosomal protein s <dig> , sam pointed domain containing ets transcription factor  and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide c , taf <dig> rna polymerase ii, tata box binding protein -associated factor  and ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain containing 1a  involved in this region on ssc <dig> and some were reported associated with pig production traits such as backfat thickness, carcass length, foot weight, head weight  <cit>  and growth traits such as limb bone length  <cit> . the common detection of this qtl region in several traits could provide good material to improve genomic models for multi-trait selection.

CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed putative qtls for tnb, ls <dig> and mort in danish landrace and yorkshire pigs. compared with bayesian models, the problem of population stratification cannot be considered sufficiently in the linear model. bayesian models provided more precise peaks than linear mixed models. using a novel approach, a total of  <dig> qtl regions were identified on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for three traits in both breeds. among these qtl regions,  <dig> regions located on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were associated with more than one trait. the qtl regions detected in the current study overlapped with the regions previously reported for reproduction traits.
