BACKGROUND
mobile introns are self-splicing dna sequences that play a major role in genome evolution. group i and group ii introns are distinguished based on their splicing mechanisms and secondary structures. apart from unique splicing mechanisms, differences between group i and group ii introns were observed within the core regions of their secondary structures. depending on these structural characteristics, group i introns have been further categorized into ia-ie classes. group ii introns constitute up to six stem-loop domains and are classified i-vi respectively . group i and group ii introns often contain open reading frames  in their loop regions  <cit> , which can encode for different site-specific homing endonuclease genes . the majority of group i introns include hegs, which have a conservative single or a double motif of the amino-acid sequence laglidadg. in contrast group ii introns encode in most cases a reverse transcriptase-like  orf . group i and group ii introns are found in all domains of life: group i introns are present in bacterial, organellar, bacteriophage and viral genomes as well as in the nuclear rdna of eukaryotes. group ii introns have a similar distribution, but are not known from the nuclear rdna . more specifically, group i and/or group ii introns are found, e.g., in eukaryotic viruses  <cit> , slime molds  <cit> , choanoflagellates  <cit> , the annelid nephtys sp.  <cit> , red algae  <cit> , brown algae  <cit>  and plants: green algae  <cit> , liverworts  <cit>  and different angiosperms  <cit> . group ii introns seem to thrive especially in plants  <cit> , whereas the largest abundance of group i introns currently occurs within fungi  <cit> . as an example, the mitochondrial  genome of the fungus ophioscordyceps sinensis harbors  <dig> group i introns and six group ii introns, accounting for  <dig> % of its mt genome nucleotides. here,  <dig> out of  <dig> group i introns and only one out of six group ii introns are located in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig>  gene  <cit> , an acknowledged insertion hotspot for mt group i introns  <cit> .

more recently, group i introns have been discovered in the cox <dig> of early branching metazoan phyla: placozoa  <cit> , cnidaria  <cit>  as well as porifera  <cit> . group ii introns are rarer, and found in the cox <dig> of placozoa  <cit> , and in one demosponge species of the order axinellida   <cit> . in porifera, group i introns have only been recorded from demospongiae and homoscleromorpha and, like in group ii introns, always in the cox <dig> gene, with only occasional double insertions . the current nomenclature of sponge group i and group ii introns is based on the intron insertion site positions in reference to the amphimedon queenslandica cox <dig> gene   <cit> . in homoscleromorpha, three different intron positions  are known for three species of the family plakinidae  <cit> . within the demosponge subclass verongimorpha intron  <dig> is detected in one species  of the order verongiida  <cit> . most intron insertions have been found within the demosponge subclass heteroscleromorpha, in the orders agelasida, axinellida  <cit>  and especially tetractinellida  <cit> . in the tetractinellida, group i introns are currently known in five sponge species belonging to three genera  and inserted at four mtdna intron positions:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  . to this date, all sponge group i introns encode a heg with two laglidadg motifs  <cit>  with the exception of intron  <dig> in plakinastrella sp. and intron  <dig> in agelas oroides and axinella polypoides, in which no orf was detected  <cit> . intriguingly, tetractinellida introns are currently only detected in the families tetillidae  <cit>  and stupendidae  <cit> .fig.  <dig> simplified sponge phylogeny highlighting currently known group i and ii intron insertion sites. horizontal black lines with colored vertical bars and numbers  behind the taxa names represent different intron locations within cox1





fungi and placozoa have been proposed as possible donors for group i introns among sponges  <cit> . however, these findings await corroboration with a broader and more comprehensive taxon set. intron/heg phylogenetic analyses and group i/ii intron secondary structures are the basis for different scenarios on the origin of introns within sponges  <cit> . the presence of independent horizontal gene transfers  for introns is supported by their haphazard distribution over phylogenetically distant sponge groups  <cit> . vertical gene transfer  of introns is assumed among closely related taxa, but never confirmed due to the lack of comprehensive taxon sampling  <cit> .

to gain new insights into the evolution of sponge introns we required an intron-rich taxonomic group. based on earlier studies on sponge introns, the order tetractinellida represents an obvious target. other lines of evidence support this choice, such as unsuccessful attempts to amplify cox <dig> in this group with standard protocols  <cit> , potentially due to introns in the relevant primer regions  <cit> . consequently, this study focuses on tetractinellid cox <dig> mitochondrial data to broaden our knowledge on mt intron evolution in this early-branching metazoan phylum.

the data from this “intron-hotspot taxon” presented here constitutes the most representative dataset to target specific questions pivotal to understand intron structure and distribution including activity and mobility. importance of hgt or vgt or a combination of both will be addressed. additionally, current hypotheses on the origin of sponge mitochondrial introns will be discussed by comparing intron data across other phyla.

RESULTS
mitochondrial intron diversity and characteristics in tetractinellid sponges
the current study comprises the largest dataset of sponge mitochondrial introns to date , encompassing  <dig> different sponge genera. all  <dig> newly sequenced introns were group i introns of the class ib, and all encoded a heg of the laglidadg family, except for intron  <dig> of aciculites sp. <dig>  where no heg was observed. a double motif of the laglidadg domain was located in all introns, if the sequence was not degenerated or without a heg. different intron lengths were observed for different species, and an overview of the different initiation and stop codons of all he orfs is given in fig.  <dig>  all introns possessed start and stop codons in the same frame as the 5′ exon, except intron  <dig> in plakinastrella sp. additionally, uninterrupted orfs in the same 5′ exonic reading frame were observed for all sequences unless introns were degenerated or without heg. initiation and stop codons varied among the intron hegs. for example the heg of intron  <dig> potentially starts with a gtg initiation codon at position  <dig> of the intron, and not tta  as suggested previously  <cit> . the heg of intron  <dig> potentially starts with ttg as its initial codon . instead of tta  as suggested by rot et al.  <cit> , all intron  <dig> hegs potentially start with att . in the intron heg  <dig> we have att  and gtg  as initiation codons. the stop codon for most he orfs was tag or taa except for cinachyrella sp.  <dig> and setidium sp. <dig> , where truncated hegs were found.fig.  <dig> overview of different cox <dig> intron positions in sponges. four group i introns  and two group ii introns  are distinguished and labeled by colors according to their different insertion sites. arrows and xs above each intron insertion indicate start and stop codons respectively. as not all taxa have the same start codon, both possible start codons are given. numbers to the left of species names refer to sequence lengths of each intron , they match the intron color. numbers to the right of species names  refer to unresolved species complexes




we discovered more introns in the spirophorina at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ; no intron at position  <dig> was found. as an example, intron  <dig> sequences were generated for five more cinachyrella sp.  <dig> taxa; four from the indian ocean  and one from the southwest-pacific . cinachyrella species are previously known to have only one intron insertion at a time . however, our study reveals that both introns  <dig> and  <dig> can occur together in cox <dig>  e.g., in cinachyrella sp.  <dig> from marine lakes  and mangroves . intron  <dig> was sequenced from  <dig> different cinachyrella species, and it is particularly present in the cinachyrella alloclada complex. in total this study contains  <dig> sequences of cinachyrella alloclada  from the western atlantic, the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico. we added six additional intron  <dig> sequences including c. cf. anomala, c. cf. providentiae, c. porosa , c. sp.  <dig> , c. sp.  <dig>  and c. sp.  <dig> . the resulting cinachyrella dataset covers subtropical-tropical areas from  <dig> to 90 m depth.

for the first time we discovered intron  <dig> in the scleritodermidae . intron  <dig> was found in tetilla quirimure from brazil and microscleroderma herdmani from the indian ocean , and the pacific . huchon et al.  <cit>  located intron  <dig> in combination with intron  <dig> in two families , while our study reveals this combination in three scleritodermid genera .

comparative intron and exon phylogenies of tetractinellida
phylogenetic reconstructions of the cox <dig> exon and the intron revealed a patchy distribution of intron insertions among the scleritodermidae and tetillidae and different levels of congruence among intron and exon phylogenies.

family tetillidae
the relationships of major clades  were in concordance with a previous study  <cit> . unlike cinachyrella, tetilla appeared monophyletic in reconstructions with five species . tetilla radiata  is sister to the intron-lacking tetilla japonica . as shown by szitenberg et al.  <cit> , our analysis supported the early-branching position of the intron 723-bearing levantiniella levantinensis with respect to the cinachyrella/paratetilla/amphitethya clade. intron 723-bearing tetillidae did not form a monophyletic group due to the position of l. levantinensis and the presence of a highly supported  clade of intron  <dig> bearing species consisting of c. sp.  <dig>  and c. sp.  <dig> . there were no genetic differences in cox <dig> between cinachyrella sp.  <dig> bearing one  or two  introns.fig.  <dig>

family scleritodermidae
the cox <dig> exon phylogeny  corroborated the sister group relationship scleritodermidae/stupdendidae, previously suggested with 18s rdna data  <cit> . results also supported the monophyly of scleritodermidae and its genera microscleroderma, aciculites and scleritoderma as previously suggested by 18s and 28s rdna phylogenies  <cit> . species in these genera displayed different intron distributions .fig.  <dig>

intron + laglidadg phylogeny
the intron  <dig> phylogeny   broadly agreed with the corresponding exon phylogeny , but also displayed several differences crucial for the understanding of sponge intron evolution. notably, we recovered intron  <dig> of cinachyrella sp.  <dig> in a different clade than for the cox <dig> of all cinachyrella sp.  <dig>  whether they have intron  <dig> or both 714 +  <dig> . the clade of introns  <dig> of cinachyrella sp.  <dig> and sp.  <dig>  from the red sea and morocco respectively, were in a sister-group relationship with l. levantinensis whereas in the exon phylogeny these two species branched within the cinachyrella clade . these incongruences between the exon and the intron phylogenies were shown to be significant -test). one single c. alloclada  <dig> sequence falls within the c. alloclada  <dig> clade. this position is regarded as artifactual due to an incomplete intron sequence as retrieved from degraded dna.fig.  <dig> intron  <dig> bayesian inference  phylogeny in sponges. the maximum likelihood  tree is congruent. squares represent node supports. black squares: pp =  <dig> – <dig> , bp = 75– <dig>  dark gray squares: pp =  <dig> – <dig> , bp = 60– <dig>  white squares: pp <  <dig> , bp <  <dig>  numbers after each taxa are genbank accession numbers or voucher numbers . sequences generated in this study are in bold . sampling localities for the subtropical-tropical cinachyrella taxa are given




interestingly, agelas oroides and cymbaxinella verrucosa intron sequences grouped within spirophorina in a highly supported sister group to cinachyrella introns. the intron + laglidadg phylogenies for  <dig> and  <dig> were congruent with the exon phylogeny for all supported clades .

secondary structure analyses of introns  <dig> and 870
the secondary structures of intron  <dig> and intron  <dig> presented the typical rna fold of a group i intron structure  <cit> , consisting of a p1-p2-p <dig> substrate domain, a p4-p5-p <dig> scaffold domain and a p3-p7-p <dig> catalytic domain . the conserved regions q, p, s, and r, building the core, were found in all of the structures.fig.  <dig> predicted secondary structures of microscleroderma sp.  <dig> , setidium sp.  <dig> , scleritoderma sp.  <dig>  , microscleroderma herdmani  <dig>  and tetilla quirimure  . exon bases are in lower-case letters and intron bases in upper-case letters. paired p1-p <dig> helices and their conserved sequences  are labeled according to the standard group i intron scheme  <cit> . the hegs are present in the loops of their respective p <dig> helix. for a better comparison the same color scheme as in szitenberg et al.  <cit>  was used to highlight differences in the p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> regions. potential start and stop codons are highlighted in light gray





our current study expands our knowledge on cinachyrella intron  <dig>  <cit>  thanks to five additional structures predicted for cinachyrella porosa , cinachyrella sp.  <dig> , cinachyrella alloclada  <dig> , cinachyrella cf. providentiae , and cinachyrella cf. anomala  . the structures of introns  <dig> and  <dig> only have a single-stranded p <dig> region, whereas intron  <dig> has a double stranded p <dig> region . the laglidadg orf is always located in the loop of the p <dig> helix .

intron  <dig> structural differences between the species are in the p <dig> and p <dig> regions. in particular, cinachyrella sp.  <dig> from morocco has reduced helices p <dig> c and p <dig> d compared to all others. cinachyrella alloclada  <dig> differs slightly in the p <dig>  p6a, p6b and p6d regions to other cinachyrella species. we generated for the first time secondary structures of scleritodermid intron  <dig> in microscleroderma sp.  <dig> , setidium sp.  <dig>  and scleritoderma sp.  <dig>  . all three species show a high variability in loops and helices within the p <dig> region. only a few differences were observed in the p <dig> region between the species. the main difference between cinachyrella and scleritodermidae intron  <dig> is the absence of the p6d region in the latter .

the secondary structure of intron  <dig> was reconstructed for tetilla quirimure  and microscleroderma herdmani  <dig>  . both taxa contain the known core helices and conserved structures of q, p, s, and r. tetilla quirimure intron structure is very similar regarding p <dig> and p <dig> regions to the one from tetilla radiata  <cit> . the intron of microscleroderma herdmani, in turn, has a reduced p6a helix and a different p5a region compared to that found in tetilla.

the laglidadg protein phylogeny
the sponge laglidadg sequences displayed phylogenetic affinities to four different clades . laglidadg  of stupenda singularis forms a highly supported sister group relationship with a fungi/marchantiophyta clade. cnidarian laglidadg encoding sequences are only present in hexacorallia and never revealed in the other subclasses octocorallia and ceriantharia. within hexacorallia, the sequences of intron  <dig> are monophyletic and include the orders actiniaria , scleractinia , corallimorpharia  and antipatharia   <cit> . notably, there are no sponge laglidadg  sequences. in comparison, several scleractinian sequences form a clade with the sponge laglidadg intron  <dig> sequences.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny based on laglidadg protein sequences of representative taxa from diverse groups. circles on the branches indicate support values. black circles: bp = 75– <dig>  dark gray circles: bp = 60– <dig>  white circles: bp <  <dig>  numbers behind each taxa are genbank accession numbers or voucher numbers. sequences generated in this study are in bold. sponge laglidadg clades for introns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are indicated with brown, red, blue and green background respectively




laglidadg  of plakina/tetilla and the scleritodermidae are closely related to hexacorallia  laglidadg sequences, but with considerable genetic distance. the genealogical affinities of intron  <dig> appear unresolved.

discussion
characterisation and mobility mechanisms of group i intron
in sponges, group i and ii introns occur coincidentally and exclusively in the cox <dig> gene in a few sponge groups . the current study specifically targeting sponge mitochondrial cox <dig> introns represents the largest sponge mt intron dataset , encompassing  <dig> different sponge genera. in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , double or single intron insertion sites within the cox <dig> gene were observed among different taxa . sponge group i intron sequences in most cases contain a putative homing endonuclease  orf, which encode for a laglidadg-type protein, unless they are degenerated . intron mobility is facilitated by those site specific hes, which conduct double-strand breaks  in alleles that lack introns, hence activating intron mobility via a dsb-repair process  <cit> . those hes are known to promote their mobility towards conserved regions  <cit> . however, only a few studies have investigated the conservation of those introns in their host genes. swithers et al.  <cit>  analysed the conservation of group i and group ii introns in the host genes of vascular plants, protists, fungi, green algae, liverworts and amoeba, but not in animals. in the former, group i introns are preferentially located within conserved regions, whereby group ii introns were not shown to remain particularly in conserved sites  <cit> . in comparison, our conservation analysis  corroborated these findings by demonstrating that even in early branching metazoans like sponges, group i introns are located in the most conserved regions of their host proteins. at present, sponge group ii intron insertions are only known from a single demosponge   <cit> , with two group ii introns in the 3′ region of cox <dig>  our conservation analysis showed that these two group ii introns were located in conserved regions , however, additional data are needed for a better understanding of group ii intron conservation and mobility in sponges.fig.  <dig> conservation profile of the complete translated cox <dig> gene for sponges. x-axis indicates the amino acid position along the alignment. y-axis assigns the number of amino-acid substitutions over a range of  <dig> aligned positions throughout the alignment. different intron insertion positions of group i introns  and group ii introns  are plotted on the profile line and color-coded with respect to fig.  <dig>  additionally, the 5′ position of commonly used sponge barcoding markers is indicated as light blue rhombuses. a detailed list of primers is provided in additional file 4





the cox <dig> gene in demosponges has the lowest substitution rate of all mt protein coding genes  <cit> . in fact, the mitochondrial genomes of the sponge classes homoscleromorpha and demospongiae possess features shared with non-metazoan opisthokonts rather than bilateria such as the presence of intergenic regions, genes of foreign origin, a low substitution rate, selfish elements and introns  <cit> . mt introns are also found in plants  <cit> , fungi  <cit> , placozoa  <cit> , and hexacorallia  <cit>  all known to have slow rates of evolution. it is assumed that this lower substitution rate slows down the elimination of ribozyme activities within group i introns, therefore hegs would degenerate slower in most fungi  <cit> , anthozoans  <cit>  and placozoans  <cit> . intron mobility is particularly dependant on secondary structure and therefore mutation pressure, so sponge introns survive in the most conserved mt gene , and the most conserved regions of this gene , where their heg is most likely to degenerate slowly. on the other hand, hexactinellid and particularly calcareous sponges possess an accelerated substitution rate  <cit>  and no known mt introns to this date. this correlation between higher mutation rate and absence of mt intron is shared by cubozoa  <cit> , ceriantharia  <cit> ; ctenophora  <cit> , hydrozoa and scyphozoa  <cit> . one exception to this pattern is the apparent lack of introns in octocorallia, despite their lower substitution rates compared to the intron-bearing hexacorallia  <cit> . this might be due to the presence of a unique muts gene, which encodes a dna mismatch repair machinery  <cit> , which prevents intron insertions. the mt dna mismatch repair machinery in sponges remains unknown.

sponge group i introns consist of complex catalytic ribozymes  that fold into a conserved three-dimensional core structure of ten helices. within this structure, the sponge hegs are found to be always located within the loop region of the catalytic domain  as in hexacorallia  <cit> . hegs and their intron partners are thought to move either independently from each other  <cit>  or as a single unit  <cit> . whether those hegs are actively expressed or not often depends on their functionality. the functional expression of heg group i introns and the resulting gains and/or losses are considered as a cyclical process of different stages  <cit> . emblem et al.  <cit>  applied this into an evolutionary model for a group i intron in sea anemones and reported five stages: 1) intron with heg expressed and fused in frame with the upstream host gene exon; 2) intron with expressed free-standing heg; 3) intron with shortened/degenerated heg; 4) intron without a conserved heg and 5) exon cox <dig> without intron. until now, only a few insights into this evolutionary model were given for sponges. different stages are observed for intron  <dig> and intron  <dig> in different sponge species  <cit> . however, no detailed information has been provided yet on the potential start and stop codons, which are crucial diagnostic features for their categorisation. the potential start and stop codons, observed in all group i introns , in addition to the predicted secondary structures , provide insights into the respective evolutionary stages of all sponge group i introns. in detail, we classified intron  <dig> of stupenda singularis in stage  <dig>  intron  <dig> of all cinachyrella sp.  <dig> appear in stage  <dig>  and in stage  <dig> for plakinastrella sp. due to several start and stop codons and no heg. intron  <dig> is found to be in stage  <dig> among all cinachyrella species except c. sp.  <dig> , which is in concordance with the already published data  <cit> . intron  <dig> in microscleroderma sp.  <dig> &  <dig> and scleritoderma sp.  <dig> &  <dig> are also found to be in stage  <dig>  a study comparing the length of dna and rna in combination with rt-pcr on a cinachyrella intron  <dig> from taiwan  suggests that it can self-splice in vivo or in vitro  <cit> . it confirms that this particular stage  <dig> intron  <dig> is active. we observe intron  <dig> also in stages  <dig> and  <dig> in aplysinella rhax, microscleroderma sp.  <dig>  cinachyrella sp.  <dig>  setidium sp. <dig>  and aciculites sp.  <dig>  respectively, which rebuts the suggested recent infection of intron  <dig> in sponges  <cit> . intron  <dig> was at stage  <dig> for tetilla radiata, plakina crypta and plakina trilopha  <cit>  and now shown for microscleroderma herdmani 1– <dig>  tetilla quirimure and setidium sp.  <dig>  interestingly, both stage 3– <dig> intron  <dig>  previously described  <cit>  co-occur with stage  <dig> intron  <dig>  also, the only stage  <dig> intron  <dig>  co-occurs with a stage  <dig> intron  <dig>  similarly, all of the stage 3– <dig> intron  <dig>  co-occur with stage  <dig> introns . overall, two stage  <dig> introns never co-occur, one of the two is always degenerating. we can therefore hypothesize that the presence of two group i introns is unstable or that maybe the degeneration of one somehow enables the insertion of a different intron. more double-intron-bearing cox <dig> sequences are needed to study this further. moreover, we noted that although scleractinia  possesses intron  <dig> or  <dig>  no evidence of double-intron cox <dig> sequences in this group is given, which applies for cnidaria in general. since double-intron cox <dig> sequences are also absent in placozoa, sponges  are to date the only metazoans with double-intron cox <dig> sequences.

hgt versus vgt of group i introns
the sporadic detections and patchy distributions of group i introns not only among sponges, but also among other metazoa in e.g., scleractinian corals  <cit> , plants  <cit>  and fungi  <cit>  are the main arguments for hgt.

hgt events for group i introns in sponges were first hypothesized by rot et al.  <cit>  and later corroborated by other studies, based on major differences between cox <dig> and intron phylogeny topologies  <cit>  as well as the occurrence of homologous introns in phylogenetically distantly related sponge groups e.g., homoscleromorphs  <cit>  and demosponges   <cit>  . our results reveal new cases of intron hgt, this time within the cinachyrella species . as an example cinachyrella sp.  <dig>  and cinachyrella sp.  <dig>  are sister to cinachyrella alloclada 2–3/ cinachyrella spp. from the pacific whereas their intron  <dig> are sister to the intron of levantiniella levantinensis . one can therefore hypothesize that an intron  <dig> of l. levantinensis  invaded the ancestor of cinachyrella sp.  <dig> and cinachyrella sp.  <dig>  in addition, two cinachyrella sp.  <dig> specimens from the pacific  group together with other conspecifics in the cox <dig> phylogeny; however, their introns are closely related to cinachyrella species from the pacific. therefore, we hypothesize that those two cinachyrella sp.  <dig> specimens from marine lakes and mangroves were reinfested by intron  <dig> after it was primarily lost, which would indicate a “secondary” hgt between c. sp.  <dig> and the pacific cinachyrella spp. . it also seems that these two specimens are losing their intron  <dig> again, which is at stage  <dig>  these hypotheses are significantly corroborated by the sh-test . another hgt event was found within the family sceritodermidae: while setidium sp.  <dig> is sister to microscleroderma taxa in the intron phylogeny , it branches off first of all other scleritodermidae taxa in the cox <dig> phylogeny . however, the cox <dig> topology is poorly supported around setidium sp., therefore this hgt event is less obvious than in the two previous cases. although the introns  <dig> found in the agelasida  are fairly divergent, the intron and the laglidadg phylogenies both suggest that they are phylogenetically related to the cinachyrella/levantiniella introns. indeed, the agelasida introns share a more recent common ancestor with the cinachyrella/levantiniella introns, than with the scleritodermidae . a hgt from an ancestor of cinachyrella/levantiniella species to some agelasida could account for this result. in all these examples it can therefore be hypothesised that a hgt occurred between distantly related sponge groups. although the mechanism of intron hgt is unknown at this point, we noted that these donor/receiver species originate from the same regions and share the same habitats , which is expected to make hgt possible.fig.  <dig> comparison of the phylogenetic relationships of cox <dig> and intron  <dig> illustrating hgt, vgt and secondary losses within the family tetillidae




similarities in intron secondary structures of distantly related sponges are further evidence for hgt  <cit> . hence, independent insertion events in tetillidae, axinellidae and agelasida were proposed for intron  <dig>  <cit> . this is confirmed by secondary structure differences we observed in closely related families  . additional loops , reduced stems  and the absence of the p6d region in sceritodermidae  result in a higher structure similarity to e.g., axinella polypoides  <cit> , rather than to other tetillidae structures , which confirms independent insertions of intron  <dig> in scleritodermidae and tetillidae. no major structural differences of intron  <dig> in the p <dig> and p <dig> regions were observed within different species of cinachyrella  except for cinachyrella sp.  <dig> from morocco, which showed reduced p <dig> c and p <dig> d helices. a few minor differences were also noted between cinachyrella and l. levantinensis structures : the latter had an additional loop in p5a, a reduced p <dig> d and a loop at the end of p6d. interestingly, the latter two features are also observed in c. sp.  <dig> , which could be explained by their common origin resulting from a hgt . the relative similarity of intron  <dig> between cinachyrella and levantiniella is a strong argument in favor of a single insertion event in this clade, which therefore implies at least two losses of intron  <dig> to account for the two major cinachyrella/paratetilla/amphitethya clades without any intron . these would be the first reported cases of mt intron secondary loss in sponges.

for intron  <dig> no structure differences were observed between tetilla quirimure   and tetilla radiata   <cit> . remarkably, tetilla japonica , which is sister to tetilla radiata  does not posses intron  <dig>  we therefore assume that tetilla japonica secondarily lost intron  <dig>  which would represent another case of mt intron loss in sponges. the structure of intron  <dig> in microscleroderma herdmani  <dig> displays a reduced p6a and an additional p5d region  compared to tetilla radiata / quirimure, which suggests an independent insertion of intron  <dig> as the most plausible explanation. this is further corroborated by the distant phylogenetic relationship between tetilla and scleritodermidae  and the laglidadg phylogeny .

until now vgt was only assumed within sponges  <cit> , but awaited proof with a wider sampling. for the first time our study on  <dig> cinachyrella sequences provides conclusive evidence that introns were vertically transmitted due to 1) mostly congruent cox <dig> versus intron phylogenies and 2) similarity of secondary structures among closely related species. introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have all undergone vgt, but this is especially apparent for intron  <dig> for which we have the largest sampling . vgt for group i introns are also known e.g., from hexacorals , but is often difficult to ascertain due to the patchy distribution of introns. to conclude, our results demonstrate that introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> undergo vgt, hgt and secondary loss events, and that both vgt and hgt can occur within one genus  .

the origins of group i introns has been debated for many eukaryotic organisms  including sponges  <cit> . fungi are proposed as the primary donor of mt group i introns not only in plants , but also in cnidarians  <cit>  and sponges  <cit> . placozoa have also been suggested as possible donors in sponges, but only for intron  <dig> in one species  <cit> . sponge-fungal associations, pivotal for such hgt, are well-known for sponges . however, only little is known about the specific fungal lineages associated with intron-bearing sponge taxa. for cinachyrella, however, deep sequencing analysis recently identified ascomycota as a dominant fungal phylum . this is corroborated by data for cinachyrella alloclada from the caribbean that showed that the cosmopolitan phoma sp.  is the dominant sponge-associated fungus, while nine more ascomycete species were found  <cit> . indeed, in the reconstructed laglidadg protein phylogeny  all intron  <dig> sequences of cinachyrella and other sponge taxa display a close relationship to ascomycete intron sequences, but also viridiplantae . the latter is not surprising, as intron of chlorophytes and viridiplantae similarly have their origin from ascomycota  <cit> . the huge assemblage of group i introns described in fungi increases the chance of a hgt event. when metazoans and plants host one or two group i introns in their cox <dig>  fungus like ophiocordyceps sinensis contains  <dig> group i introns within its cox <dig> region alone  <cit> .

the non-bilaterian laglidadg-protein sequence dataset  identifies scleractinia  and zoantharia  sequences as the only sequences respectively homologous to the sponge introns  <dig> and  <dig>  although this is not very well supported, our results show a sister relationship between laglidadg in scleritodermidae and zoantharia, which suggests they may have contaminated each other ; alternatively they were contaminated by the same donor, un-sequenced as of today. because the scleractinia intron  <dig> laglidadg sequences are nested within the sponge sequences , fukami et al.  <cit>  suggested two alternative scenarios: 1) scleractinia and sponges have a similar fungi donor which independently transferred intron  <dig> in each group or 2) hgt events from each other . however, although intron  <dig> has a patchy distribution in the scleractinia  <cit> , the scleractinia laglidadg sequences form a well supported clade , which suggests that the origin and therefore the donor must have been the same. different sponges can be excluded as donors, because otherwise the scleractinia sequences would be partly mixed with the sponge sequences. also, the possibility of one single sponge donor is unlikely, because there is no sponge species living in close contact with all these scleractinia species from the indo-pacific and the atlantic. thus, we are in favor of a donor, most probably a fungus, which transferred intron  <dig> to different scleractinia, while similar donors transferred intron  <dig> to different sponges. these donors can probably also act as vectors, thereby enabling hgt between cinachyrella species, as shown above. intron  <dig> of stupenda singularis is the only sponge laglidadg sequence apparently unrelated to any coral laglidadg in the data set, but is closely related to laglidadg found in fungi and marchantiophyta . liverworts are thought to have received their introns from fungi  <cit> , and the close relationship of the stupenda singularis laglidadg  <dig> likewise suggests a fungal origin .

unfortunately, the origin of sponge intron  <dig> remains unresolved, since no supported relationship to any of the included taxonomic groups is given. therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that group i introns in sponges may originate from an undiscovered and/or un-sequenced sponge-associated symbionts, e.g., fungi, archaea, bacteria or dinoflagellates, since all are known to posses group i introns. in particular sponge bacterial symbionts, which can contribute to over 50% of the sponge biomass  <cit> , may play an essential role as potential intron donors. however, according to our results  it is unlikely that bacteria, archaea or dinoflagellates are donors, because of the absence of a homologous laglidadg motif. blastx of intron  <dig> specified fungi as best hits, therefore fungi remains a good donor candidate for this intron. according to the diversity of habitats of intron-bearing sponges, from shallow water  to the deep sea , we can hypothesize that the putative intron donor may also be ubiquitous, and present in all these different environments.

implications for dna barcoding
intron insertion in highly conserved cox <dig> regions decreases the possibility of intron elimination, because the removal must be specific in order to avoid any disruption of the protein function. the most widespread intron  <dig> is located at the most conserved site in the cox <dig> gene , suggesting this position as an “intron hotspot”. in addition to the high number of intron  <dig> in tetillidae, we discovered several more intron  <dig>  and intron  <dig> , both in conserved cox <dig> regions. intron presence in conserved cox <dig> gene regions has major consequences for other fields of science such as molecular taxonomy. in order to gain a better understanding of locations and conservation of the currently recommended barcoding primers  <cit> , we plotted the 5′ site of each primer on the cox <dig> conservation profile line . interestingly, for the standard barcoding fragment and the i3m <dig> extension our analysis shows that all previously applied sponge barcoding primers are located in comparatively less conserved regions . moreover, our results indicate that group i intron  <dig> and group ii intron  <dig> are in close proximity to barcoding reverse primer sites  or interrupt the priming regions , which corroborates earlier findings from szitenberg . these findings may partly explain the low  amplification success reported for barcoding museum samples using standard barcoding primers  <cit> . we therefore recommend for future sponge barcoding studies to test the reverse cox1-r <dig> primer, which is more distant to the intron insertions, instead of the hco <dig> primer . the cox1-r <dig> primer, originally designed to amplify the cox <dig> of tetillidae  <cit> , has been shown to successfully amplify cox <dig> in poecilosclerida  <cit> , agelasida and axinellida  <cit> , chondrosiida and dictyoceratida  <cit> , some astrophorina  and spirophorina .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides novel insights into the taxonomic distribution, diversity and mobility of mitochondrial group i introns in sponges, and validates the subclass spirophorina , as an intron hotspot in sponges, notably by increasing the number of tetillidae introns known by a factor of  <dig>  we wonder whether this could be linked to a lower mt mutation rate in the spirophorina with respect to other sponges, as suggested for some intron hotspot fungi groups  <cit> . we show that co-occurrence of two introns in cox <dig> is unique among metazoans, but not uncommon in sponges. however, this combination always associates a potentially active intron with a degenerating one. earlier hypotheses of hgt were confirmed and for the first time vgt and secondary losses of introns conclusively demonstrated. consequently, such a high level of hgt in combination with the relative low variation in case of vgt , rejects any alternative use of mt introns as phylogeographic markers. since the majority of sponge introns encode a heg in frame with the 5′ exon, activity of those introns is assumed. we further demonstrate that introns are not restricted to shallow water sponge species, but also occur in species from deeper  habitats and extreme environments . conservation profile analysis reveals that all group i and possibly also group ii intron insertions in sponges are located within the most conserved regions of their host protein, which may partly explain why they persist in their host genes. at the same time, we show that the currently used sponge barcoding primers are usually located in less conserved regions compared to the introns, but can also overlay intron insertion sites. therefore, we recommend applying different primers  when standard barcoding primers fail to amplify the cox <dig> gene. finally, our study enhances the support for a fungal origin for the majority of introns in sponges.
