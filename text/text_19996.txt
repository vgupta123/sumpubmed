BACKGROUND
olfaction, the sense of smell, is a versatile and sensitive mechanism for detecting and discriminating thousands of volatile odorants. olfactory recognition is mediated by large repertoires of olfactory receptors , which activate a g-protein-mediated transduction cascade, located in the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons  <cit> . the human or repertoire has  <dig> loci, encompassing  <dig> genomic clusters and  <dig> singleton loci, residing on all but two human chromosomes  <cit> . each sensory cell expresses a single allele of a single or locus, thus transmitting a molecularly defined signal to the brain  <cit> . a single or gene may recognize more than a single odorant molecule  <cit> . a widely accepted working hypothesis is that allelic variants of or genes may harbor different functional characteristics and hence, may generate different odorant sensitivity phenotypes in different members of the human population  <cit> .

human ors encompass a high number of pseudogenes, whereby more than 50% of the loci annotated as nonfunctional due to frame-disrupting mutations  <cit> . primates are less dependent than mouse and dog on olfactory cues, which appears to have resulted in a gradual gene loss process along this lineage  <cit> . similar or repertoire diminutions have been reported in other mammals  <cit> . in higher apes, the gene loss has remarkably accelerated in humans  <cit> . such diminution of the functional or repertoire in humans is an ongoing evolutionary process, as demonstrated by the past identification of or genes that segregate between intact and pseudogene forms  <cit> , and by more recent surveys showing an enrichment of loss-of-function or alleles  <cit> . it was shown that every human individual is characterized by a different combination of such segregating pseudogenes , constituting a pronounced genotypic diversity in the population, including ethnogeographic differences  <cit> . more recently, using a high-resolution microarray applied to  <dig> individuals  <cit> , and a read-depth-based copy number variation  genotyping algorithm  <cit> , we showed a wide range of copy-number values across individuals, ranging from zero to nine copies. these results are in-line with other surveys which found a significant enrichment of ors in cnv regions  <cit> . cnvs involving deletions  were shown to affect  <dig> intact or loci, 14% of the human or gene repertoire  <cit> .

cell-surface receptors are often characterized by several haplotypic alleles in the population, sometimes with different functional properties. a prominent example is the group of the major histocompatibility proteins with varying specificities towards antigenic peptides  <cit> . other examples include the taste receptor tas <dig>  underlying responsiveness to the bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide   <cit> , the melanocortin  <dig> receptor , affecting human skin and hair pigmentation  <cit> , and the green opsin opn1mw, mediating red-green color vision discrimination  <cit> . likewise, in the olfactory system, two protein haplotypes of the olfactory receptor or7d <dig> were shown to manifest large difference in sensing the steroid odorant androstenone  <cit> .

some missense haplotypic alleles can be nonfunctional, due to a substitution of key amino acids governing protein folding or interaction with signal transduction components. a continuous spectrum of functionality among missense haplotypes may be quantified by algorithms such sift  <cit>  or polyphen  <cit> . an analogous algorithm, classifier for olfactory receptor pseudogenes   <cit> , was previously used to identify  <dig> snp variations for which one of the alleles is likely inactive  <cit> , with a broader estimate of as many as  <dig> functionally inactive missense alleles in the reference genome  <cit> .

here, we performed scrutiny of publicly available data to create a comprehensive catalog of genetic variability in the human or repertoire. this includes a compendium of all available missense haplotypes of or proteins and a dramatically expanded list of or segregating pseudogenes. our work creates a framework for understanding the evolution and function of or genes, and a necessary infrastructure for genotype-phenotype association studies for smell deficits. it further highlights the utility of the olfactory system as a model for personalized gene repertoires.

RESULTS
numerous allelic variants in intact ors
we performed in-silico data mining of genomic variations in or genes and segregating pseudogenes, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, small indels  and structural variations. these were obtained from  <dig> individuals of the  <dig> genomes project, including three major ethnic groups, as well as from  <dig> additional resources . our compendium contains  <dig>  polymorphic events  within coding regions of  <dig> functional gene loci, the latter selected as having an intact open reading frame in at least one of the individual human chromosomes analyzed . the breakdown of these variations to seven categories is shown in figure  <dig>  additional file  <dig> lists all duplications and inversion structural variations, not further discussed herein. altogether, we observed an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  polymorphic variations of all types per ~930 bp open reading frame, similar to what we found in or pseudogenes . the combinations of polymorphic variations within each or open reading frame are subsequently used to define haplotypic or alleles at the dna and protein levels . all variations are available at the human olfactory receptor data explorer database   <cit> .

we subsequently analyzed  <dig> missense variants found in the imputed and haplotype-phased data of the  <dig> genomes project for  <dig> individuals, to obtain  <dig> putative haplotypic or alleles. of these,  <dig> alleles are present in  <dig> or more individuals, and hence are less likely to be false positives . a display of allelic diversity for  <dig> typical or loci indicate as many as  <dig> haplotypic proteins per locus, with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . every one of these allelic dna sequence variants ostensibly represents a distinct functional protein, portrayed by a color-coded functional score based on the previously published corp algorithm  <cit> , including indications for probable non-functionality . figure  <dig> shows three or genes with maximal corp score inter-allele diversity. we also portray three genes with reported odorant specificity  <cit> . for the androstenone-binding or4d <dig>  all  <dig> haplotypic alleles have similarly high degree of predicted functionality. for the aliphatic thiol-specific or2c <dig> the  <dig> alleles have similar intermediate-level functionality prediction. in contrast, for the amyl butyrate-binding or2ag <dig> a bimodal distribution of predicted functionalities is seen, pointing to the possibility of modified odorant responses .

the foregoing analysis embodies a significant enhancement of the or repertoire in every human individual via haplotypic diversity. thus, a large majority of human individuals analyzed harbor 490– <dig> different haplotypes at the  <dig> loci, i.e. 85– <dig> loci in a heterozygous state . this amounts to a repertoire augmentation of 20–40%. the three ethnic groups have pronouncedly different allele count distributions, with africans having an especially high average of 557 ±  <dig> different or sequence variants per individual . different ors often have dissimilar variant distribution in the three populations as exemplified in figure 5b. these results are consistent with the idea of african origin of modern humans  <cit> .

nonfunctional variations
we next focused on the analysis of nonfunctional variations that eliminate specific members of the or allele repertoire in a given person, hence are excellent candidates for underlying inter-individual odorant threshold differences  <cit> . first, we analyzed small events, i.e. stop snps and indels  that result in frame disruption, as derived from  <dig> different data sources . among the  <dig> or loci annotated as intact genes in the reference genome we identified  <dig> cases for which at least one nonfunctional allele was seen. in addition, among the  <dig> ors defined as pseudogene in the reference genome, we identified  <dig> ors that harbor an intact allele in at least one person, and may be considered as “resurrected” from fixed pseudogene status . thus, among  <dig> thus defined intact loci, a total of  <dig> loci  show segregation between intact and nonfunctional alleles . this provides a major enhancement relative to our previously published set of  <dig> segregating pseudogenes  <cit> . when analyzing  <dig> subjects from the  <dig> genome project for which both snps and indels are available, we found that every human individual has 21 ±  <dig> deletion heterozygotes and 11 ±  <dig> loci that are homozygously disrupted.

we performed experimental validation for  <dig> nonfunctional snps  and  <dig> frame-disrupting indels . for this we designed a custom snp array  that included the total of  <dig> nonfunctional variations. these were genotyped in a cohort of  <dig> individuals of two ethnicities, providing validation for  <dig> of the variations, as compared to a most probable value of validation of 197 ±  <dig> based on the cohort size and specific minor allele frequencies . the number of nonfunctional snps per individual  thus discovered is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  a significant correlation was seen between the allele frequencies in the  <dig> genomes project data and our validation sets .

deletion cnvs
we further performed integration of biallelic deletion cnvs for all or loci, utilizing five different data sources . this revealed  <dig> such cnv events . this brings the total number of loci that harbor a nonfunctional allele in the examined populations to  <dig> . as previously seen for segregating pseudogenes  <cit> , here too we observe a great inter-individual variation in the combinations of or loci affected by deletion cnvs .

the combined variation results of the deletion cnvs with the spg genotypes strongly reinforce the notion that practically every individual in the human population has a different combination of intact and inactive alleles . using a phasing procedure , we could assign deletion locus haplotypes to  <dig> ors, which in some cases harbor more than one event on a given chromosome, and in others create compound heterozygosity for two deletion types . using this combined view we find that, on average, every individual genome carries a disrupted allele at 35 ±  <dig> loci, of which 11 ±  <dig> are homozygously affected . because every olfactory sensory neuron expresses a single allele at an or locus, heterozygosly deleted spgs might have a phenotypic outcome. the personalized repertoire of intact and inactivated ors significantly differs among ethnic groups , and such differences are dominated by a subset of or loci, representing both class i and class ii ors, that manifest a relatively large inter-group variation . there is however no significant difference in homozygous deletion alleles among the different populations .

or evolution
we asked whether or genes harbor an unusually high frequency of missense variations. for this, we compared the number of non-synonymous snps in two gene sets. the first was  <dig> or genes defined as intact in the reference genome, and the second control set constituted  <dig> protein-coding genes that  have a single coding exon. the latter included non-or g-protein coupled receptors, keratin associated proteins, protocadherins and histones. ors were found to have  <dig>  ±  <dig>  missense snps per open reading frame, while the controls had  <dig>  times less such snps . this was confirmed in a second test set of  <dig>  protein coding genes . synonymous snp counts showed a much smaller, though significant, difference between ors and controls . we note that or genes and pseudogenes show a similar propensity of non-synonymous snps , with a slight, statistically significant excess in intact ors . the simplest interpretation is that on average ors may neutrally accumulate genetic variations, mainly due to less stringent purifying selection as compared to non-ors  <cit> .

we asked whether some of the or genes accrue variations in a non-neutral fashion by examining the ratio of polymorphic non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site to polymorphic synonymous substitutions per synonymous site   <cit> , whereby a value near one would suggest neutrality. while for most ors the results are consistent with neutrality, there is significant enrichment in the high pn/ps region of the distribution in ors compared to controls, consistent with selection . a subclass of the ors with pn/ps> <dig>  also have a positive value of tajima's d  suggesting balancing selection. we asked whether the subgroup of fast evolving ors  is enriched with “evolutionary young” genes, defined as those lacking one-to-one orthology relationships with the chimpanzee orthologs  <cit> . we find that no such enrichment occurs, as among  <dig> fast evolving ors, the fraction of evolutionary young genes is  <dig> %, while for all other ors the fraction is  <dig> %. we further note that a relatively small subgroup of  <dig> ors  in our dataset  show evidence for strong purifying selection . this low count as compared to  <dig> % in controls, is likely related to the tendency of ors to evolve towards higher inter-individual diversity  <cit> . thus, for the specific receptors showing this evolutionary pattern , such sequence conservation may indicate functional importance, e.g. recognition of essential odorants essential for the species as a whole.

discussion
an or variation compendium
using various databases and experimental resources, we have compiled a compendium of synonymous, missense and nonsense snps, as well as copy number variations within or coding regions. a major resource for this work was the  <dig> genomes project’s whole genome sequence data  <cit> , yielding variation and phase information. a significant caveat regarding such data is their low coverage in each sequenced individual and the imputation procedures used in the phasing process  <cit> . this is partly ameliorated by the fact that the main body of our analyses is based on cumulative data from 300– <dig> human chromosomes. another point of concern is that some of the variations were obtained from dbsnp  <cit> , for which population frequencies or validation are sometimes not provided. indeed, in our experimental validation of  <dig> or nonfunctional snps, a majority  of the unsupported variations were mined only from dbsnp.

enormous gene variability
our results portray an overview of the degree of inter-individual genomic variability harbored in the or gene inventory. we report on an enormous amount of genomic variation ,  <dig>  times larger than in single coding exon control genes. our analyses suggest that such enhanced variation is largely due to neutral drift, both because the propensity of variations per coding region is similar to that found for or pseudogenes, and since the average pn/ps value for the intact ors is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , consistent with neutrality.

previous studies reported on positive selection acting in specific or genes  <cit> , potentially related to a recent evolutionary acquisition of a capacity to recognize specific behavior-related odorants  <cit> . our results do not provide clear evidence for such selection mode. other reports suggest that the or diversity may be maintained to some degree by balancing selection  <cit> , similar to that acting upon the major histocompatibility complex alleles  <cit> , leading to enhanced ligand recognition success at the population level  <cit> . while balancing selection for ors has been disputed  <cit>  our results suggest that a fraction of or genes may be under such selection mode, a mechanism consistent with the advantage for heterozygosity in a pathway endowed with allelically excluded expression. this is in line with a previous report showing higher than expected count of heterozygotes at or snps in the hapmap populations, which led to the conclusion that the human ors may have been shaped by balancing selection, stemming from overdominance  <cit> .

weak purifying selection has also been suggested to affect a subpopulation of human ors, as seen by human-chimpanzee comparisons  <cit> . in line with this, we identified nearly  <dig> ors in our dataset showing evidence for this evolutionary mechanism. such evolutionarily conserved or genes may subserve the recognition of specific odorants important for survival and/or propagation of the species. interestingly, this group of human genes has a higher fraction of candidate orthologs in mouse, as compared to dog, consistent with a presently accepted phylogeny whereby primates and rodents belong to the same clade, different from that of carnivores  <cit> , although a rodent-outside phylogeny was also suggested  <cit> .

in sum, it is difficult to negate the possibility that certain modes of selection act on subsets of human or genes, but it is rather certain that no single mode applies to all ors. such heterogeneity of selection modes within the large or repertoire has also been reported in dog  <cit> .

the human allele repertoire
irrespective of evolutionary path, it is obvious that human ors show an unusually high variability as compared to other intact protein-coding genes. we report that some human individuals have as many as  <dig> or coding regions at their ~ <dig> intact or loci. some of these allelic protein variants may have different odorant affinity and/or specificity  <cit> . previous reports demonstrate that olfactory sensory neurons express only one of the two alleles at a given locus  <cit>  with a possibility that allelically excluded neurons report independently to olfactory bulb glomeruli in the brain  <cit> . this, together with allele plurality, generates a powerful mechanism for augmenting functional variation and enhancing odorant recognition capacities. furthermore, a higher size of the effective or repertoire may also signify enhanced average sensitivity to odorants  <cit> . the functional significance of allelic diversity most likely applies to other species as well  <cit> .

loss of function alleles
one of the striking results of the present report is the extremely high prevalence of loss-of-function or alleles. based on the data mining performed, among the  <dig> human genomic or loci,  <dig> have a frame-disrupting pseudogene apparently fixed in the entire population. of the  <dig> remaining loci,  <dig>  have at least one allele lacking an intact open reading frame, including frame disruptions and deletion cnv alleles. the corp algorithm  <cit>  predicts that an additional  <dig> loci have missense nonfunctional alleles, with a corp score >  <dig> , suggesting a probable non-functional or protein. thus, as many as  <dig> or loci harbor one or more functionally disrupted alleles, and only  <dig> loci appear to be purely functional in the studied population. this is likely related to the emergence of a large number of or pseudogenes in higher primate evolution  <cit> . further, the very high incidence of segregation between intact and nonfunctional alleles attests to a possible highly accelerated gene inactivation in recent human evolution. this potentially took place on a shorter time scale than the previously indicated human-specific acceleration in or pseudogene accumulation relative to apes  <cit> .

the presently reported number of  <dig> non-intact loci is fivefold larger than an earlier estimate of ~ <dig>  <cit> . this number will likely increase even further as many more human genomes become available. curiously, among the non-intact loci are included  <dig> that were originally annotated as pseudogenes in the reference genome. further sequencing would probably show additional such cases of “resurrected” ors, most likely from among the  <dig> fixed or pseudogenes that have only one frame disruption  <cit> . it should be pointed out that or pseudogenes are not processed pseudogenes  <cit> , and hence are typically endowed with all features of intact ors  and are only different from the intact form by frame-disrupting mutations.

personal noses
our comprehensive portrayal of genetic variability in or genes provides considerably enhanced support for the notion of “different noses for different people”  <cit> . while for the  <dig> individuals analyzed from the  <dig> genomes project data the overall count of homozygous deletion genotypes per individual is not very high , the inter-individual variability is vast: there was no case of two individuals having the same deletion pattern across all relevant loci. furthermore, viewing the broader picture of nonfunctional alleles of all types, as well as protein missense alleles, a randomly selected pair of subjects will on average share only  <dig> of the alleles, and the remaining  <dig>  will be different . importantly, on average 32% of all fully intact or loci are heterozygously disposed, encoding two different active or protein variants. a heterozygous deletion event affecting such a locus could have an odorant sensitivity phenotype, as only one of the two different functional alleles would remain active, and the allelically-excluded neuronal pattern could thus be modified.

analysis of deletion cnvs with high-confidence breakpoints revealed that, for a typical individual, 40% of the deletion cnvs affect more than one  intact or genes, consistent with previous reports  <cit> , thus highlighting the large impact of cnvs as opposed to smaller variants. however the contribution of deletion cnvs to the overall number of disrupted alleles per individual is less pronounced.

receptor diversity and ethnogeography
our results generally suggest substantial differences among the three major ethnogeographical groups analyzed: caucasians, africans and asians. the most significant result is that africans have a higher number of or protein haplotypic variants, with implications to chemosensory diversity. such findings are in line with the reported higher genetic diversity in this ethnogeographical group  <cit> . some of the protein variants are seen only in one or two of the groups, and others show great disparity of relative allele frequency. the three different human races also have distinct patterns of deletion allele genotypes, which again could affect chemosensory preferences. previously, we have reported a slightly higher number of intact or loci in africans as compared to caucasians  <cit> . the results reported here, utilizing a much larger number of deletion loci, shows no statistically significant difference in this realm between ethnic groups.

CONCLUSIONS
we used data mining strategies to generate a comprehensive compendium of genomic variations in the inventory of human or coding regions. our analyses suggest that the effective size of the functional human or repertoire is much higher than the number of intact loci, implying considerable enhancement of the potential of human smell perception diversity. importantly, using both data-mining and experimental verification we show that more than two thirds of human or loci segregate between an intact and inactivated alleles. these results portray a case of unusually high genetic diversity, and suggest that individual humans have a highly personalized “barcodes” of functional olfactory receptors, a conclusion that likely applies to other receptor multigene families as well.
