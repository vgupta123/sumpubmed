BACKGROUND
salmonella is an important and globally distributed foodborne pathogen, which causes an estimated  <dig> million gastroenteritis cases, and  <dig>  deaths annually, among the global human population  <cit> . in the united states, salmonella causes an estimated  <dig> million annual human cases and is the leading reported cause of death and hospitalization related to foodborne disease  <cit> . this pathogen is principally acquired by the consumption of contaminated food, although contact with infected animals and human to human transmission are also known transmission routes of salmonella <cit> . dairy cattle and dairy products are important sources of salmonella; a number of serovars ranked in the top  <dig> salmonella serovars among human cases in the u.s.  are commonly isolated from dairy cattle  <cit> . whereas several studies have reported the prevalence and distribution of salmonella on dairy farms, there is limited data on salmonella phage distribution in this environment. recently, our group reported a high prevalence and diversity of salmonella phages on dairy farms in rural areas of new york state, and also identified closely related phages on farms hundreds of miles apart  <cit> . we thus elected to use phage isolates from dairy farm environments as a model to explore the genomic diversity of salmonella phages associated with a specific environment.

bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on this planet, show a high degree of host specificity, and phages are present in all the environments where a suitable host is found  <cit> . phage populations have been estimated to be highly dynamic, for example, it has been estimated that approx.  <dig> phage infections per second occur globally in marine environments  <cit> . consequently, phages play pivotal roles in bacterial evolution, from killing bacteria to being agents of horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . several salmonella phages and prophages have been reported , and selected phages have been fully sequenced  <cit> . currently, there are genome sequences available for salmonella phages from different regions of the world , isolated from diverse animal production facilities , and with different host specificity . regardless of the previously available phage genome sequences, the diversity of salmonella phages is still severely under-sampled and our knowledge of the genomic diversity of salmonella phages associated with different environments is very limited.

RESULTS
the fact that salmonella is well recognized as a diverse species, with > <dig>  serovars, various patterns of transmission, and host specificity, has led to considerable recent efforts  <cit>  to characterize the salmonella pangenome and to probe the diversity of this pathogen at the genomic level. by comparison, our knowledge of salmonella phage genomic diversity has remained rather limited; in big part due to under-sampling. we thus selected  <dig> salmonella phages, with a range of different phenotypic and genotypic characteristics  <cit> , from nine dairy farms for genome sequencing to characterize the salmonella phage diversity in environments  and hosts  where salmonella is commonly found. major findings of this study include  identification, by cluster analysis, of two salmonella phage orthoclusters that have not been previously reported,  identification of four phage clusters containing phages previously identified in various locations worldwide,  identification of phages carrying putative antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes,  identification of dna metabolism genes in salmonella phages with g+c contents different from salmonella, and  evidence of salmonella phage tailspike and fiber diversity due to both single nucleotide polymorphisms and major re-arrangements.

identification, by cluster analysis, of two salmonella phage orthoclusters that have not been previously reported
the  <dig> newly sequenced phage genomes ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb with g+c contents ranging from  <dig> to 56% ; previously sequenced salmonella phages ranged in genome size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb and showed g+c contents between  <dig> to 53%  <cit>  . annotation of the genomes sequenced here identified between  <dig> and  <dig> genes in a given phage, which is consistent with reports on previously sequenced salmonella phages  <cit> . a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> phages sequenced here contained known lysogeny modules, suggesting a temperate life cycle . to initially characterize the diversity of these phages, we clustered phage genomes based on the presence/absence of families of orthologous genes, similar to a method previously used to cluster mycobacteriophage genomes  <cit> . we refer to this approach as an orthoclustering analysis, and will refer to the resulting clusters of phages as orthoclusters. a total of  <dig> phage genomes were included in this analysis, including the genomes for   <dig> phages characterized here,   <dig> salmonella phages that have previously been reported, and   <dig> phages that represent type species of known phage genera infecting enterobacteriaceae <cit>  . this analysis revealed eight distinct and well supported  clusters of phage genomes;  <dig> of the  <dig> new phage genomes reported here grouped into one of these eight well supported clusters . overall, the eight clusters identified here contained phages with high levels of overall genome homology. for example, the seven phages in cluster  <dig> shared 62/ <dig> orthologous genes with amino acid  identities for these genes ranging from  <dig> to 100% . the five phages in cluster  <dig> shared 98/ <dig> orthologous genes with aa identities for these genes ranging from  <dig> to 100% . the genome wide nucleotide identity of phages sequenced here was also compared using a dot plot , which supported the cluster relationships that were derived based on the orthocluster analysis. for example, phage fsl sp- <dig> falls in a separate branch from the other fsl phages in cluster  <dig> , and the dot plot analysis shows that fsl sp- <dig> displays low sequence similarity  when compared to the other phages in cluster  <dig> , this result is in agreement with the considerable nucleotide divergence observed between fsl sp- <dig> and the other fsl phages in this cluster .

 <dig> fsl sp- <dig> and fsl sp- <dig> only differ in  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms; therefore, fsl sp- <dig> is a variant of fsl sp- <dig> 

 <dig> phage orthoclusters were determined based on presence/absence of orthologous genes.

 <dig> putative families were determined in silico as described in methods.

 <dig> families were also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.

 <dig> presence of lysogeny module was used to identify the putative life cycle of a given phage isolate.

phage fsl sp- <dig>  a  <dig> kb phage, which contains a known lysogeny module , could not be assigned a specific cluster . this phage clustered with the salmonella phage gifsy- <dig> and fels- <dig>  and shares 18/ <dig> orfs with gifsy- <dig> , with an average aa sequence identity of 87%. in addition, two of the new phage genomes reported here  grouped into clusters that only contained other phages isolated from the u.s. fsl sp- <dig> has a  <dig> kb genome that contains a known lysogeny module , indicating that this is a temperate phage. this phage groups into cluster  <dig>  along with p <dig>  the type species of the genus p2likevirus. this genus also includes the enterobacteria phage psp <dig> , which also infects salmonella <cit> ; fsl sp- <dig> and psp <dig> present an average aa identity of 92% among the  <dig> orfs shared. fsl sp- <dig>  a  <dig> kb phage  that appears to be virulent , clustered with enterobacteria phage t <dig> , which is the type species of tunalikevirus. among the  <dig> orfs in fsl sp- <dig>   <dig> have an ortholog in t <dig> .

five of the eight phage clusters identified here contain phages that were isolated from different farms . for example, cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> phages isolated from five farms , while cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> phages isolated from three farms . this finding is consistent with previous pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and restriction fragment length polymorphism  data  <cit> , on these as well as additional phages, which also found evidence for isolation of similar phages on dairy farms hundreds of miles apart. combined, these data suggest that these phages may either be genetically stable and endemic or easily dispersed among farms , consistent with the fact that salmonella is commonly found on dairy farms  <cit>  and can be transmitted between farms through various means  <cit> .

two of the clusters identified here  only contained the genomes of salmonella phages isolated here; these two clusters thus represent groups of salmonella phages that have not been previously reported and their genomic characteristics are briefly described here. cluster  <dig> includes two phages  that were obtained from  <dig> different farms. ninety-seven orfs were found in the phages of this cluster, functionally annotated orfs include, for example, dna polymerase, rna polymerase, tailspikes, and terminase subunits ; aa identity among  <dig> orthologs found in both phages ranged from  <dig> to 100% . while these two phages do not contain a lysogeny module, suggesting that they are virulent, further phenotypic characterization of these phages is needed to confirm a virulent life cycle. phages fsl sp- <dig> and fsl sp- <dig> share a conserved backbone, but show considerable variation in the two tailspike encoding genes , which, as discussed below in detail, is often related with host range variability  <cit> . a blastp search of all cluster  <dig> orfs against genbank revealed no matching phages, suggesting that phages in cluster  <dig> appear to be novel virulent salmonella phages.

cluster  <dig> is the second cluster that includes only phages characterized here; the two phage isolates in this cluster  were obtained from the same farm. we identified  <dig> orfs in the phages of this cluster,  <dig> of them are hypothetical proteins and only  <dig> orfs could be functionally annotated . a lysogeny module is also absent in these two phages. interestingly, only four single nucleotide polymorphisms  differentiate phage isolates fsl sp- <dig> and fsl sp- <dig>  with three of these snps located in the gene encoding the tail fiber; these two phage isolates thus should be considered variants rather than different phages . similar to cluster  <dig>  a blastp search of all cluster  <dig> orfs against genbank revealed no matching phages, suggesting that the cluster  <dig> phages also represent novel salmonella phages. overall, we thus identified a number of novel salmonella phages in this study, consistent with many reports that bacteriophages are extremely under-sampled and that with more environments and locations being sampled, more novel phages are likely to be identified  <cit> .

identification of four phage clusters containing phages previously identified in various locations worldwide
in addition to two phage orthoclusters that only contained phages characterized here, we also identified four clusters  that each contains phages sequenced here as well as previously sequenced salmonella phages obtained from other locations throughout the globe. phage cluster  <dig> contains six very similar phages  as well as one phage that was isolated in south korea , which has not been assigned a genus to date  <cit> . these phages have a syntenic genome , a size of approx.  <dig> kb, and a g+c content of  <dig> % . annotations identified genes encoding phage morphogenesis and replication proteins . a lysis control module was identified in the  <dig> phage genomes sequenced here, but not in phage spn <dig>  interestingly, phages fsl sp- <dig> and fsl sp- <dig>  which cluster together based on the overall homology from the mauve alignment, were found to carry a different lysogeny control module  as compared to the other four phages, which encode a lysogeny control module that shows homology to the phage related helix-turn-helix xre-family of transcriptional regulators  <cit> . further analyses showed that the genomes of phages in cluster  <dig> resemble the genome of enterobacter cancerogenes phage enc <dig>  <cit>  , a phage of the siphoviridae family that has not been assigned a genus to date, according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses  <dig>  <cit> ; this phage was hence not included in the cluster analysis shown in figure  <dig>  a enterobacter phage enc <dig> shows synteny with cluster  <dig> phages. while there are  <dig> hypothetical proteins present in phage enc <dig>  but not in the cluster  <dig> phages,  <dig> orthologs were found in both enc <dig> and the cluster  <dig> phage fsl sp- <dig> ; the average aa identity among these shared orfs is approx. 75%. these data indicate that phages similar to cluster  <dig> have previously been isolated from enterobacteriaceae hosts other than salmonella.

cluster  <dig> contains five salmonella phages , two sequenced in this study  as well as three previously reported salmonella phages  . in addition, one previously reported shigella phage  showed homology with the phages in this cluster   <cit> ; a recent publication proposed these phages as “viunalikevirus”  <cit> , a new phage genus in the family myoviridae. phages belonging to cluster  <dig> possess large  genomes ; in the two phages sequenced here , we identified  <dig> orfs,  <dig> of them were functionally annotated . while orfs involved in phage morphogenesis, replication and dna metabolism were found to be conserved among these six phages, genes involved in host specificity  showed considerable diversity , consistent with previous reports that these genes often show diversity due to recombination and therefore considerable mosaicism  <cit> . despite their isolation from three continents, phages in cluster  <dig> present an overall genome synteny as well as high level conservation  . interestingly, this conservation appears to be stable in both time and space; salmonella phage vi <dig>  which is the type species of this genus was isolated in canada in the 1930’s  <cit> .

cluster  <dig> includes three salmonella phages sequenced in this study , one salmonella phage isolated in switzerland , and one well characterized salmonella phage isolated in the u.k. in  <dig>   <cit> . the five phages in this cluster have an approximate genome size of  <dig> kb ; aa identity among  <dig> shared orthologs ranged from  <dig> to 100% . felixo <dig> is the type species of the genus felixounalikevirus, this phage genus also includes salmonella phage spt- <dig>  isolated in the u.s., e. coli phage wv <dig>  isolated in the u.s., e. coli phage ec <dig>  isolated in south korea, and erwinia phage Φea21- <dig>  isolated in canada  <cit>  . we thus not only identified three new members of the genus felixounalikevirus, but also provided further evidence that felixounalikeviruses are widely distributed. whole genome alignments, showed that phage fo1a is the closest to felixo <dig>  followed by the three salmonella phages sequenced in this study ; the most distinct phage genome among the felixounalikeviruses is erwinia phage Φea21- <dig>  which only shares some orfs with these phages, but lacks orfs conserved among the rest of the phages in this genus . the major difference between felixo <dig> and phages sequenced here were found to be insertions and deletions of homing endonucleases, which are mobile elements that have been reported in some phages  <cit> . interestingly, genes encoding homing endonucleases are often inserted between genes or inserted into genes that appear conserved among these closely related phages. while high numbers of genes encoding homing endonucleases were reported for felixo <dig>  <cit> , we here provided evidence that the presence of homing endonucleases appears to be common for felixounalikeviruses.

cluster  <dig> includes seven salmonella phages, four phages sequenced in this study , two isolated in south korea , and one isolated in the u.k.   <cit>  . phages in this cluster have a genome size of approx.  <dig> kb ;  <dig> orfs were predicted among these phage genomes, including  <dig> annotated as hypothetical proteins and  <dig> that were functionally annotated . cluster  <dig> represents two groups of phages ; group  <dig> represents three of the phages sequenced here ; these three phages are highly conserved . the other group  contains three previously sequenced phages and one of the phages sequenced here  . group  <dig> phages fsl sp- <dig> and fsl sp- <dig> have 96% aa identity among  <dig> shared orthologs; the major differences between these two phages and fsl sp- <dig> are insertions and deletions of six hypothetical proteins and one homing endonuclease. this suggests that phages in this cluster are also hosts for homing endonucleases  <cit> . each of the  <dig> phages in cluster  <dig> encodes a dna/rna helicase, which is a protein described to be involved in dna replication and recombination  <cit>  and could thus facilitate genomic rearrangements in phages in this cluster . overall, each of the four phage clusters discussed above contains not only phages from multiple farms, but also phages from at least two continents. in addition, two of these clusters contain the genomes of salmonella phages that were isolated > <dig> years ago. our findings here of closely related phages that are globally distributed are consistent with other genomic studies  <cit> ; for instance, closely related pseudomonas phages  were isolated from different countries in europe and the u.s.  <cit> . similarly, closely related mycobacteriophages were isolated from up to four different continents   <cit> . interestingly, some of these phage groups contain closely related phages that appear to have adapted to different hosts, including hosts representing different bacterial genera. while a number of studies suggest rapid diversification of phages, e.g., through recombination  <cit> , our data suggest that at least some phage groups are relatively stable at the genomic level and also suggest that phage dispersal could contribute to global spread of transmissible genomic elements, including those encoding resistance and putative virulence genes.

identification of phages carrying putative antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes
virulence genes have been reported in a number of phages, including e. coli shiga toxigenic phages  <cit> , and prophages, including the salmonella prophages gifsy- <dig> and gifsy- <dig>  <cit> . in this study we describe the presence of putative antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in genomes of virulent and temperate salmonella phages. in the genome of fsl sp- <dig> we identified  one putative antimicrobial resistance gene, a homologue of bcr, which encodes a protein linked to bicyclomycin resistance. bcr has been reported in a number of different gram-negative and positive bacteria. bicyclomycin is an antimicrobial compound, which inhibits the transcription terminator factor rho  <cit> . this antimicrobial is obtained from cultures of streptomyces spp. and is effective against gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella <cit> . bicyclomycin is used as feed additive in livestock in some countries, but this use of bicyclomycin is not approved in the u.s.  <cit> . however, this antimicrobial could be synthesized naturally by streptomyces spp., which are commonly found in soil  <cit> . as fsl sp- <dig> is a temperate phage, presence of phage-encoded bicyclomycin resistance could be a selective advantage for the phage as it could facilitate survival of the host; however, we have no evidence for horizontal gene transfer or lysogen expression that would lead to phenotypic bicyclomycin resistance; further experiments are necessary to determine if the presence of bcr can lead to phenotypic resistance.

in addition, each of the two phages in cluster  <dig> was found to carry  a putative virulence gene  and  a homologue of terb , which is part of a tellurite resistance operon  that has been found in the chromosome and plasmids of different bacteria  <cit>  . similarly, a terz homolog was reported in cronobacter phage vb_csap_gap <dig> . yada was first identified in enteropathogenic yersinia species  <cit>  where it was reported to encode an agglutinating adhesin , a virulence factor that has been reported to mediate yersinia adherence to epithelial tissue  <cit> . in addition to the phages reported here, a yada homologue has also been identified in enterobacteria phage Φeco <dig>  synechococcus phage metag-mbcm <dig>  prochlorococcus phage p-hm <dig>  and pectobacterium phage my1; an alignment of Φeco <dig> and the two phages of cluster  <dig> showed that they share no other regions of homology. importantly, the genes encoding yada homologs in fsl sp- <dig> and fsl sp- <dig> do not seem to locate close to genes encoding tail-morphogenesis proteins; rather, these genes are located next to a gene encoding a hypothetical protein and a gene encoding a deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotide hydrolase. as both phages in cluster  <dig> did not contain a known lysogeny module, indicating that they are virulent phages, and did not show evidence for transduction , it remains to be determined though if yada can be transferred to salmonella  and if so if it would contribute to virulence in a recipient. as the function of terb remains unknown  <cit>  and as only one gene from the terzabcdef was present in the cluster  <dig> genomes, it is difficult to assess the functional importance of carrying this gene, even though tellurite is known to be toxic for bacteria because it generates reactive oxidative species , which can damage metabolic enzymes and cause lipid peroxidation  <cit> . importantly, these two phages were isolated from two different farms, suggesting a certain selective pressure to maintain terb, and the agglutinating adhesin.

 <dig> this protein shows homology with both dini  and with msga, . experimental data will be needed to assign a functionally appropriate name to this gene.

a transduction frequency was calculated as the number of transductants/pfu used for transduction; moi multiplicity of infection.

in addition to carrying virulence and resistance genes, phages can also contribute to the dispersal of genes through lysogenic conversion and horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . we thus performed transduction assays, which found that 4/ <dig> tested phages were able to transfer the chloramphenicol resistance gene from the s. typhimurium donor strains to the recipient strain  . the transduction frequency   <cit>  ranged from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> , which falls in the range previously reported for salmonella phages. for example, salmonella phage p <dig> had previously been shown to transduce at a frequency of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> <cit> . variations in transduction frequencies with different multiplicity of infections  and between replicates  are consistent with previous reports  <cit> ; for example, p <dig> has shown up to  <dig> -fold differences in transduction frequency  <cit> . interestingly, transducing phages belonged to two clusters, one identified in this study as representing temperate phages  and one previously identified as representing virulent phages . while transduction in temperate phages is easier to identify in laboratory conditions than in virulent phages , a number of virulent phages have been identified as transducing phages  <cit> . this indicates that even if genome sequences indicate a virulent life cycle  and absence of phage-borne virulence and resistance genes, in vitro transduction tests are needed before a phage can be considered as safe to use as biocontrol agent.

identification of dna metabolism genes on salmonella phages with g+c contents different from salmonella
in five phage clusters  we identified a number of genes involved in dna metabolism. all of these clusters represented phages with a g+c content different from the salmonella genome ; phages in clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed average g+c contents of 56%, 45%, 39%, 39%, and 42%, respectively . however, in phages with a g+c content like salmonella , no orfs were annotated as dna metabolism genes. the number of dna metabolism genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> genes per phage. for example, all phages in cluster  <dig>  carry  <dig> genes annotated as playing a role in dna metabolism . the same dna metabolism genes had previously been identified in phages felixo <dig> and Φea21- <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that these genes are part of the genomic backbone of this phage genus. phages in cluster  <dig> included six dna metabolism genes . these genes also appear to be part of the backbone of this phage cluster as supported by identification of these genes in closely related phages  that also grouped in this cluster  <cit> . dna metabolism genes have previously been reported in a number of phages  <cit> ; the best characterized phage carrying dna metabolism genes is bacteriophage t <dig>  <cit> . in t <dig>  proteins involved in dna metabolism, replication, and repair function in a complex called t <dig> nucleotide precursor complex  <cit> , which converts cellular nucleotide precursors into deoxynucleotide triphosphates with a different g+c ratio than the host  <cit> . as t <dig> has a g+c content of  <dig> %, it uses the nucleotide precursor complex to adjust the host’s nucleotide ratios  to ratios needed for t <dig> replication  <cit> . our data indicate that similar mechanisms may be at play to facilitate replication of salmonella phages whose g+c content differ from their host. expression of dna metabolism genes may thus be a common mechanism used to debottleneck dna replication in some phages with a g+c content different from their hosts.

evidence of salmonella phage tailspike and fiber diversity due to both single nucleotide polymorphisms and major re-arrangements
tail fibers and tailspikes are appendages in the phage tail that facilitate the initial binding of the phage to the bacterial host; they hence represent primary receptor-binding proteins. phages can have one or more tailspikes or fibers, or combinations of tailspikes and fibers  <cit> . these virion structures target proteins or polysaccharides in the host surface, and therefore, have a role in host specificity  <cit> ; nucleotide polymorphisms, duplications and rearrangements in the tail fiber and tailspike encoding genes appear to be associated with changes in the host range  <cit> . as our initial analysis  found evidence for  major re-arrangements in genes encoding tailspikes and fibers in some orthoclusters  and  small number of snps in the tail fibers of the three other orthoclusters , we performed more detailed analyses to characterize the genetic diversity in genes encoding tailspikes and fibers.

in the six phages in orthocluster  <dig>  the region that contains the four genes encoding tailspikes is by far the most variable region of the genome ; however, the tail fiber gene is conserved among all six phages . in addition, for two phages in this cluster , overall aa identities in all tailspikes and the tail fiber were high . highly variable tailspikes typically presented a fairly conserved n-terminal, with low aa identities in the c terminal  . these findings are consistent with hooton et al.  <cit> , who previously analyzed the tailspikes in three phages of the viunalikevirus genus ; conservation of the n-terminal residues is also consistent with the fact that this region attaches to the baseplate, while the remainder of the protein projects from the surface and appears to be involved in initial binding to the host  <cit> . although future experimental work is needed, a role of the c-terminal variable regions in phage host specificity is supported by the observation that one of the tailspikes of the salmonella typhi specific phage vi <dig> has a conserved acetyl esterase domain that recognizes the typhi capsule as receptor  <cit> . phage sfp <dig>  which was reported to infect both salmonella and e. coli o157:h <dig>  also carries tailspikes that presented similarity to tailspikes found in both e. coli and salmonella phages  <cit> , suggesting a possible role of these regions in host specificity.

phages in orthocluster  <dig>  encoded two tailspikes, these proteins also presented a conserved n-terminal and a highly divergent c-terminal  ; these two phages show considerable differences in host range . while the two tail fibers in the orthocluster  <dig> phages typically show a higher level of conservation and a longer conserved n-terminal region, the c-terminal region of one tail fiber  still shows considerable variability in four of these phages . the second tail fiber gene in cluster  <dig> presented two distinct alleles; phages fsl sp- <dig>  fsl sp- <dig> and fsl sp- <dig> share one conserved tail fiber  as do phages se <dig>  sept <dig>  ss3e, and fsl sp- <dig> , with only 27% average aa identity between these two tail fibers .

phages in orthoclusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  on the other hand, showed low divergence in their tail fibers. for example, among the four phages in orthocluster  <dig>  tail fiber  <dig> was highly conserved , while tail fiber  <dig> showed  <dig> to 93% aa identity among these phages . interestingly, these phages differ considerably in their host range; felixo <dig> infected all  <dig> salmonella strains tested , while fsl sp- <dig>  fsl sp- <dig>  and fsl sp- <dig> present a narrower host range infecting  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively . further experimental and comparative genomics studies of these phages may thus provide an opportunity to understand why some phages such as felixo <dig> have an extremely wide host range. the two phage variants in cluster  <dig> showed 100% aa identity across the proteins they encode except in the tail fiber, which presented three amino acids changes ; two substitutions of glutamic acid to glycine and one of phenylalanine to isoleucine . while these two phage variants were isolated from the same farm, fsl sp- <dig> infects s. newport and s. kentucky, but fsl sp- <dig> only infects s. newport . experimental studies are necessary to validate the role of these mutations in the increase of fsl sp- <dig> host range. further studies on the contributions of different diversification patterns on phage host specificity, facilitated by the comparative genomics studies reported here, will provide a possibility to advance towards a more rational approach to constructing both narrow and wide host range salmonella phages, which may open new opportunities in phage based detection and biocontrol.

CONCLUSIONS
this study used a genomic approach to investigate the diversity of  <dig> newly sequenced salmonella phages. a number of novel salmonella phages were identified, representing phages different from currently known phage genera infecting enterobacteriaceae. comparative genomics analyses of these phages have provided a number of new insights in the evolution and diversity of salmonella phages, such as identification of a possible wide-spread role of dna metabolism genes in facilitating replication of phages with gc contents distinct from the gc content of salmonella. our data also elude to the possibility of distinct mechanisms, among different phage families, of tail fiber and tailspike diversification, which may be linked to evolution of host specificity. clearly, our analyses reported here only provide a first glimpse into the diversity of salmonella phages that is likely to be discovered when phages from different environments are characterized by full genome sequencing and metagenomic approaches.
