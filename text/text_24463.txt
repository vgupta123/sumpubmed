BACKGROUND
carbohydrate-binding proteins  are highly diverse in terms of their sequences, structures, binding sites, and evolutionary histories  <cit> . sequence-based classifications  are an attempt to organize this diversity, and do so by grouping cbps into evolutionarily related families and subfamilies. many of these families have a common function and mechanism, while in others functions have diversified  <cit> . prediction of novel cbps with unique binding sites and mechanisms that are unrelated to known cases is a more difficult task, as there is no single sequence profile or pattern that defines a carbohydrate-binding site. thus, while sequence-based carbohydrate-binding site prediction methods have been shown to be moderately successful, structural information will be key to achieve higher prediction accuracies  <cit> .

structure-based algorithms are a promising approach for prediction and analysis of binding sites in proteins from first principles. just as sequence profiles and patterns can be used to infer function in uncharacterized sequences, the existence of specific structural patterns in incompletely characterized structures may provide clues into their functions  <cit> . as binding site residues and other functional motifs may be close in  <dig> d space but be non-contiguous in the amino acid sequence, structural patterns are inherently better at representing proteins functions than primary sequence alone. a number of structure-based approaches have been applied to carbohydrate-binding site prediction, and have achieved reasonable prediction accuracy  <cit> . however, even using structural information, not all carbohydrate-binding sites can be correctly predicted . structure-based prediction of cbps with novel folds and binding sites has also not been performed and validated experimentally. given their enormous potential in biotechnological applications  <cit> , computational prediction of novel cbps is a worthwhile goal.

it is unlikely that general feature-detection approaches will be able to identify all types of carbohydrate-binding sites. carbohydrate ligands are diverse in size, geometry and other physicochemical characteristics  <cit> , and this diversity is mirrored in the features of carbohydrate-binding sites in proteins. a few recent studies have developed more targeted approaches that apply structure-based methods to specific classes of cbps  <cit> . at a cost of lower generality, approaches that focus on structural motifs of particular functional classes of cbps may achieve predictions with better ligand specificities and greater overall accuracies.

a useful structural and functional classification of cbps is described by boraston et al.  <cit> . carbohydrate-binding modules  were divided into three main types  based on their structural and functional characteristics, where members of each class are not necessarily related and do not share a common sequence pattern. type a cbms, which bind insoluble carbohydrates, possess a unique structural signature of three surface aromatic residues whose side-chains are arranged in a coplanar orientation to dock to a crystalline carbohydrate surface. in the binding sites of type b  cbms, there are typically two coplanar aromatic residues which form a "sandwich" or "clamp" around the glycan ligand. through hydrophobic stacking  interactions  <cit> , aromatic sidechains of type a and b cbms bind to their respective glycan ligands, which are polysaccharides or oligosaccharides. smaller monosaccharides, however, are the targets of type c cbms, which do not necessarily possess coplanar aromatic motifs. the use of aromatic motifs as structural signatures of cbps is consistent with computational and experimental analyses of carbohydrate-binding sites. malik et al.  <cit> , who scored amino acid propensities in known carbohydrate-binding sites, found that trp is extremely overrepresented . mutations of aromatic residues such as trp have also been shown to significantly decrease carbohydrate-binding activities  <cit> . ultimately, these studies indicate that trp and tyr are highly prevalent in carbohydrate-binding sites, while phe and his are found less frequently. the abundance of trp is partially due to it having the largest surface area of all amino acids for potential hydrophobic interactions. the relative abundance of tyr over phe is explained by the ability of tyr to form additional h-bonds and electrostatic interactions because of its hydroxyl group. thus, even within aromatic residues, subtle sidechain differences have the potential to affect carbohydrate-recognition.

while binding sites like those found in type c cbms may be more structurally diverse and thus harder to identify using a structural signature, aromatic motifs found in type a and b cbm binding have the potential to be used as  <dig> d motifs in structural database screening to identify novel carbohydrate-binding sites  <cit> . in this work, we expand on a previous 3d-motif approach  <cit>  to perform a comprehensive pdb-wide screen for coplanar aromatic surface motifs. the primary goal is to determine whether such motifs are significantly enriched in carbohydrate-related proteins and can be used to identify novel cbps and binding sites not found in existing cbp families. a novel prediction  is then analyzed computationally and tested experimentally.

pr-5d refers to the tobacco pathogenesis-related protein, which is a member of the larger pr- <dig> family, including the proteins thaumatin and osmotin. anti-fungal activity has been demonstrated for pr-5d  <cit>  and related pr- <dig> proteins  <cit> , but the structural basis of this activity is still unclear. membrane pore-formation has been suggested as one possible anti-fungal mechanism  <cit> . carbohydrate-binding and hydrolytic functions have also been observed for a number of pr- <dig> proteins . carbohydrate interactions are consistent with structural modelling studies of pr- <dig> proteins, which have demonstrated that pr- <dig> proteins contain highly acidic clefts suitable for carbohydrate hydrolytic function  <cit> . this suggests that the mechanism may involve interactions between pr-  <dig> proteins and pathogen cell wall carbohydrates. the pr-5d surface motif predicted in this study is therefore of particular interest because pathogen-specific insoluble-carbohydrate binding may represent a previously unknown mechanism by which pr-5d acts on specific pathogens of tobacco and related species. furthermore, the results of this work highlight a critical surface region on which subtle mutations may underlie important functional novelties in the pr- <dig> family. in a broader sense, this study highlights the potential of structural motif screening approaches to predict novel functions using large-scale structural data.

RESULTS
linear discriminant analysis of coplanar aromatic surface motifs
to determine whether coplanar aromatic surface motifs like those found in type a and b cbms are structural signatures of glycan-binding proteins, linear discriminant analysis  was applied to a training set of coplanar aromatic motifs occurring in structures of known glycan-binding proteins. positive cases used in training included  <dig> pairs of glycan-binding aromatic residues in known type a and b cbm binding sites from  <dig> different structures . negative cases used in training included  <dig>  random pairs from the nh3d reference dataset  <cit> , further filtered to  <dig>  pairs by selecting only those whose features were no worse than the worst-case values found in the positive cases . this conservative approach is intended to identify and separate putative carbohydrate binding motifs from similar inactive aromatic groups on protein surfaces.

based on coplanarity of aromatic sidechains, solvent accessibility, residue type, and distance, lda was able to effectively separate the two classes based on the input features . twenty out of  <dig>  of the positive cases scored greater than 95% of background scores, and  <dig> out of  <dig>  scored greater than 90% of the background scores.

the coefficients of linear discriminants, which provide an indication of the contribution and relationship of each variable to the discrimination, are shown in figure  <dig>  the signs of each coefficient are as expected; the distance parameter is negative indicating a preference for aromatic pairs in closer proximity; solvent accessibility  is positive indicating a preference for greater surface exposure; and theta is negative indicating that lower angles  is preferred. the residue-type parameter resscore was the strongest discriminating variable between aromatic motifs found in glycan-binding sites and random, aromatic surface motifs.

pdb screening reveals a significant association between aromatic surface motifs and carbohydrate related functions
after parameter fitting, the algorithm was applied to  <dig>  non-redundant structures from the nrpdb dataset, with an initial  <dig>  aromatic pairs from  <dig>  different structures that passed the parameter thresholds. these were screened for pairs that received a raw lda score greater than the 99th percentile score  of all sites analyzed in the initial training set. this resulted in  <dig>  high-scoring aromatic pairs from a total of  <dig> unique structures.

to determine whether the proteins identified by screening are enriched in carbohydrate-related functions, go terms for all structures were retrieved using the goa database  <cit> , and go terms for proteins identified in the screen  were assessed for statistical enrichment using the binomial test . out of  <dig> total go associations for proteins in the set of  <dig> structures identified in the screen,  <dig> significantly enriched go terms were detected according to the binomial test with a false-discovery rate  adjustment for multiple testing  <cit>  and conservative fdr cutoff of  <dig>  . nine of these are associated with carbohydrate-related functions . for example, out of  <dig> structures in the nrpdb annotated with go:  <dig> ,  <dig> of these were identified in the screen. thus, a quarter of the structures with this annotation contain an aromatic pair motif that scores higher than the 99th percentile. of  <dig> structures in the nrpdb that contain the term go:  <dig> ,  <dig> of these were identified. this is equivalent to a four-fold enrichment , and over five-fold enrichment  in carbohydrate metabolism and binding functions, respectively. when the screening threshold score is lowered, a larger proportion of structures from these go categories are identified, but at the expense of more false positives. for example,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> carbohydrate-binding structures were identified when searching for motifs scoring greater than the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile scores, respectively. this demonstrates that many carbohydrate-binding proteins not identified in the top 99th percentile screen also possess similar aromatic motifs that are simply lower-scoring.

for some apparently enriched terms not directly related to carbohydrate-binding , these terms are commonly linked with carbohydrate-related enzymes and thus exhibit significant enrichment in the dataset. for example, 1lwj , is tagged with go:  <dig>  as well as go:  <dig> , and go:  <dig> . all three of these terms showed significant enrichment .

example predictions
representative examples of several correctly identified glycan-binding sites in structures not included in the training set are shown in figure  <dig> . in the selected structures, predicted aromatic motifs with raw lda scores > 99th percentile have been highlighted along with their corresponding bound glycan. each predicted binding site and most of the folds are unique, and the aromatic motifs have in these cases have arisen independently through convergent evolution.

also shown are  <dig> predicted aromatic-motif binding sites occurring in structural genomics proteins whose functions are incompletely characterized or unknown . while carbohydrates/glycans are likely targets of the predicted motifs, they may also be binding sites for other ligands .

the detected motifs are similar to those found in type a and b cbms, and are predominantly trp-rich coplanar strip or sandwich motifs. all examples shown in figure  <dig> contain trp/trp motifs, as this was the most highly scored residue combination and thus occurs most frequently in the top percentile of scoring. all of the structural genomics proteins shown have different folds from the structures in the training set, with one exception. pdb id 3hnm  structurally aligned well with the cbm  <dig> xylan-binding domain  according to vast   <cit> , but has very a low sequence identity  to this protein.

in several of these cases, sequence or structural similarities also support the possibility of carbohydrate-binding functions. pdb id 1u9c is in the same scop superfamily  as a <dig> beta-galactosidase middle domain . a blast search of 2i9i detected similarity to "neuraminyllactose-binding hemagglutinin" proteins . pdb id 2b <dig> has a nudix fold also found in gdp-mannose mannosyl hydrolase nudd . pdb id 1pbj has a cbs-domain pair fold, and a similar site in pdb id 2rif binds amp. lastly, 3cbw is a structure of beta-mannanase bsman26a from bacillus subtilis  <cit> .

the motifs shown in figure  <dig> were identified using an lda score threshold equivalent to the 99th percentile score. however, it is important to note that other known and candidate carbohydrate-binding structures had motifs scoring below this threshold. for example, the structural genomics proteins, pdb id 3e5z  and pdb id 3dsm  are likely to interact with carbohydrates and had predicted binding sites scoring highly  but below the threshold.

a high-scoring aromatic motif on the surface of pathogenesis-related protein, pr-5d
one of the top predictions was a surface motif in the pathogenesis-related protein pr-5d from tobacco. the putative binding site in pr-5d received a raw lda score of ~ <dig>   for the w34/w <dig> pair, ~ <dig>   for the w36/w <dig> pair, and ~ <dig>   for the w34/w <dig> pair. thus, the motifs in pr-5d received extremely high scores, scoring higher than many of the glycan-binding sites from the training set. compared to all proteins in the nrpdb analyzed in screening, this putative binding site had scores greater than  <dig> % of cases.

the crystal structure of tobacco pr-5d  is shown in figure 4a. the predicted binding site in pr-5d comprises three trp residues , which form a highly coplanar and accessible surface region reminiscent of coplanar aromatic surface motifs found in the binding sites of type a cbms . it forms a separate and distinct surface patch from the putative active site cleft .

in addition to pr-5d, only  <dig> other structures out of  <dig>   were found to contain type a cbm-like triplets with scores greater or equal to that of pr-5d. such binding sites composed of three or more coplanar aromatic motifs were identified by grouping together pairs of high-scoring coplanar aromatics that share a common residue.

given previous associations between the hydrolytic cleft and glycan binding  <cit> , it is possible that motifs within or near the hydrolytic cleft of pr-5d also contribute to cellulose binding. in addition to w34/w36/w <dig>  a weaker scoring pair was detected near the hydrolytic cleft . this site received an lda score of  <dig> , placing it in the 86th percentile of all scores. though this site and other motifs in the hydrolytic cleft are suitable for binding glycan chains, they do not possess the common pattern of type a cbm binding sites, and are much less likely to be capable of binding to a crystalline-cellulose surface.

an insoluble cellulose-pulldown assay of tobacco proteins identifies pr-5d
the structural analysis indicates that pr-5d possesses a significant structural signature of carbohydrate-binding proteins, the w34/w36/w <dig> motif that is similar to insoluble-carbohydrate binding motifs found in known type a cbms. thus, the binding activity of pr-5d towards insoluble cellulose was tested experimentally using a cellulose pulldown assay of tobacco  proteins, followed by mass spectrometry. a similar experiment performed with insoluble chitin was also performed in a previous study, which identified a chitinase cbm but not pr-5d  <cit> . tobacco plants were first treated with salt in order to cause an ethylene-induced stress response in order to induce pr-5d gene expression  and obtain a larger pr-5d yield than that expected under normal conditions. in the cellulose-pulldown assay, tobacco protein extract was mixed with insoluble cellulose, and the mixture was washed stringently in order to remove non-cellulose-binding proteins and purify only proteins with strong binding activity towards insoluble cellulose. the cellulose-binding fraction was then analyzed with sds-page, stained with both coomassie and silver stain, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. the stringent conditions resulted in several faint bands on the coomassie stained gel, which were more easily visualized using silver stain . a band at the expected size  of pr-5d was present, which was then excised and identified by mass spectrometry . ms analysis identified two peptides, which were identified as the top-scoring match to the sequence of the tobacco pr-5d protein . the identification of pr-5d in the cellulose-binding fraction demonstrates that pr-5d has insoluble-cellulose-binding activity and validates the computational prediction.

phylogenetic analysis of the pr-5d w34/w36/w <dig> motif
to further support the functional importance of the cellulose-binding motif, patterns of residue conservation across species were investigated. close homologs of pr-5d were retrieved via a blast search of the ncbi nr protein database and a multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree was constructed. the predicted aromatic motif residues and corresponding residues from other related pr- <dig> proteins were then mapped onto the phylogeny in order to phylogenetically trace the origin of the w34/w36/w <dig> motif in pr-5d.

phylogenetic analysis revealed that pr-5d is a member of a highly conserved clade of pr- <dig> proteins exclusive to the solanaceae family of plants including tomato , potato , chili pepper , and several species of tobacco  . this clade of pr-5d proteins, extremely well supported by a bootstrap value of 98/ <dig>  all share the w34/w36/w <dig> motif, which is not present anywhere else in the phylogeny . the 100% conservation indicates the functional importance of this clade-defining motif, and suggests it may be a potential evolutionary and functional determinant of this group of solanaceae pr- <dig> proteins.

a proposed function of the solanaceae specific pr-5d subfamily
solanaceae plants are common targets of the deadly plant pathogen, phytophthora . the clade-defining, putative binding site towards insoluble-polysaccharides in the plant-defense protein, pr-5d, may be an evolutionary adaptation towards defense against phytophthora. unlike fungi, which are commonly studied targets of pr- <dig> proteins, a distinguishing feature of phytophthora infestans and other oomycetes is that they possess a cell wall containing insoluble cellulose  <cit> . previous studies have shown that pr- <dig> related proteins such as tobacco osmotin are active against phytophthora infestans  <cit> . according to the tree, tobacco osmotin and related osmotin-like proteins are indeed the most closely related sequences to the pr-5d subfamily . the occurrence of the w34/w36/w <dig> motif may therefore represent a functional innovation in response to phytophthora invasion and infection, providing additional indirect support for the mechanistic importance of this motif.

CONCLUSIONS
through this work, it has been shown that key features of surface aromatic motifs  can be used to structurally distinguish known and novel glycan-binding proteins and their binding sites from random protein structures. this provides further support for approaches that use physicochemical and geometric features of protein surfaces to analyze and predict specific protein functions  <cit> . by performing a large-scale screen of the pdb using the  <dig> d pattern, existing carbohydrate-binding sites were correctly predicted as well as novel motifs in structural genomics proteins of unknown function. in addition, aromatic surface motifs were found to be significantly associated with carbohydrate-related functions. a high-scoring prediction  was studied structurally, phylogenetically and experimentally. the combined results suggest that the w34/w36/w <dig> surface motif in pr-5d may function as an insoluble-polysaccharide binding site that targets polysaccharides such as cellulose in pathogen cell walls. a likely target is the major plant pathogen, phytophthora, which has a cell wall made of cellulose, and which commonly infects the solanaceae species in which the pr-5d w34/w36/w <dig> motif is present.
