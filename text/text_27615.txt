BACKGROUND
the recent technological progress made scanning the whole pathology slides affordable and its integration in the routine pathology workflow feasible. this resulted in a revived interest in developing new computational methods for nuclear morphometry and tissue architecture characterization, as well as for developing new tissue-based biomarkers  <cit> . in the last decade, genomic and proteomic techniques have been the methods of choice for novel biomarker discovery. when applied to the same sample, the pathology imaging and *omics technologies allow the investigation of the underlying biology from different perspectives, increasing the chances for identifying effective biomarkers. ideally, these perspectives could be integrated in a common data analytical framework, to enable a joint  data mining and decision  <cit> .

traditionally, the methods for analyzing pathology images focused on extracting quantitative measures for a set of predefined morphological parameters  and on reproducing the expert’s decision in diagnostic applications . more recently, a number of applications of pathology image analysis combined image-based quantitative features with genomic information. for example, yuan et al.  <cit>  showed that nuclear morphometry is an independent prognostic factor that can improve a genomic signature. a similar approach is discussed by kong et al.  <cit>  in the case of glioblastoma where they show how nuclear and cytoplasmic features can be linked to genomic profiles and survival outcome. more advanced techniques combine several image-derived characteristics, such as co-localization of tumor nuclei and lymphocyte infiltration  <cit> . in all these cases however, the imaging features were predefined and based on previous known associations between histopathology and diagnostic/prognostic.

our interest is in developing a more general computational framework that would allow the integration of the standard histopathology images in the biomarker discovery workflow and in which the image features would be learned in a data-driven fashion, enabling a prior-free data mining. the main challenge when analyzing the pathology images stems from their high complexity and size, and seeming incompatibility with *omics data. in the present work we propose to use the bag-of-features approach  <cit>  for reducing the dimensionality of the images and extracting salient features. this approach has already been used in histopathology image classification applications  <cit>  and has the main advantage of allowing an unsupervised learning of image representation. the features extracted describe mostly the textural appearance of small neighborhoods and may be combined with other types of features  in later stages of image analysis, but these approaches will not be discussed here. as an alternative to bag-of-features, one could use deep learning methods for learning image features as proposed by cireşan et al.  <cit>  or cruz-roa et al.  <cit> . however, these methods require a larger sample size and were applied in a supervised learning context.

we propose a novel representation of histopathology images which extends the standard bag-of-features with a number of derived measurements aimed at capturing more global characteristics of the tissue sample. in addition, we introduce an objective criterion for optimizing the image representation. the new computational framework is demonstrated in a biomarker discovery scenario, where prognostic features  for relapse-free survival in breast cancer are sought. we see the application of this approach as a succession of two independent steps, not necessarily performed on the same data corpus. in the first step, a histopathology image representation is learned from a collection of images representative for the pathology under investigation. in the second step, the images of interest are recoded based on the constructed representation and the resulting image features are jointly analyzed with the molecular and clinical data.

methods
data
the data used in this study is a subset of the data from moor et al.  <cit> , selected solely based on the availability of the material for analysis. overall there were n= <dig> standard pathology  slides with breast tissue sections, not all containing a tumoral component and not necessarily from different cases. all images were obtained by whole-slide scanning of the pathology slides at 40× magnification, resulting in color images of about  <dig> × <dig>  pixels.

these data were partitioned into an image model learning set  and a biomarker discovery/data mining set . in the biomarker discovery set we kept unique cases for which the slides contained > <dig> % tumor component and the clinical, survival and gene expression data were all available. the expression profiles of  <dig> target genes  were obtained by quantitative real-time pcr . a full description of the data set is available in moor et al.  <cit>  and the major characteristics of the biomarker discovery set used here are given in additional file  <dig> 

we computed the genomic prognostic signature  as described in antonov et al.  <cit>  for all the cases with full genomic profiles.

image processing
preprocessing
all images were downscaled to an equivalent of  <dig> × magnification by subsampling the gaussian-filtered higher resolution images . in the resulting images a mask corresponding to the tissue regions was obtained by adaptive thresholding in the green channel. the mask was subsequently refined by morphological operations: erosion with a circular structuring element with radius  <dig> followed by gap filling and removal of small objects.

for each image we estimated the intensity of haematoxylin  staining by deconvolving the rgb-images as described by ruifrok et al.  <cit> . the intensity levels of the haematoxylin image  were adjusted by adaptive histogram equalization. finally, the background pixels were masked out using the tissue region mask computed as above. in all subsequent image processing steps, only the h-images were used.

learning the image representation
the bag-of-features  <cit>  approach has two main stages:  learning an appropriate codebook for representing the images of interest and  re-coding the images based on the frequencies of each codeblock . thus, the resulting representation of the image is a histogram of the codeblocks. for the current application, we extended this representation to include several derived features. we point out that once an appropriate image representation is learned, it can be applied unchanged to other similar image collections thus this step does not need to be repeated on each new data set.

codebook learning
the codebook is a collection of representative local descriptors {c <dig> …,ck} obtained as centers of k clusters resulting from k-means clustering of a number of image local descriptors . for this, the images are decomposed in a set of local neighborhoods for which descriptor vectors are computed. the local descriptors range from pixels intensities to responses to filter banks or other textural descriptor. for the histopathology images, the gabor wavelets provide a good set of descriptors, so they were adopted in the present work. each local neighborhood of size w×w was convolved with a bank of  <dig> gabor filters  <cit> , 
 g=exp−x2+y22σ2×exp2πνj  where j=− <dig> ν was the frequency, θ the orientation and σ the bandwidth of the gaussian kernel. these parameters were set to σ∈{ <dig> },θ∈{kπ4|k= <dig> …,3} and ν∈{3/ <dig> / <dig> /16}, respectively. they were kept fixed throughout all the experiments. for each filter response, its mean and standard deviations were recorded, thus each local neighborhood w×w was represented by  <dig> values . a comparison of gabor wavelets with other local descriptors, in the context of histopathology image analysis, is given by budinská et al.  <cit> .

the size of the codebook , k, is a free parameter that has to be chosen/guessed at the moment of codebook construction  <cit> . it can also be optimized for the problem at hand  <cit>  using, for example, the gap statistic  <cit> . here we took advantage of having available a number of examples for different tissue components  which we used as reference categories. the goal was to choose the size of the dictionary k in such a way that the representations of these categories are sparse and have a minimal overlap. for each image i, let yi= {j | if codeblock cj is used in coding the sample i}, be the set of codeblocks used in its coding. then we define the following quantities : 
total jaccard index, 
 j= <dig> ∑|yi∩yj||yi∪yj|, 

where the sum is taken over all pairs  of images from different reference categories;

total sum of within-cluster distances, 
 d=∑k=1k∑i∈clusterk∥xi−ck∥ <dig>   where xi are the descriptor vectors.



with these quantities, we defined an  objective function: 
 Ψ=lognc2−logj−logd− <dig> logk,  where nc is the number of reference categories . the overall goal of our image recoding step is to find a low dimensional  representation which still bears enough information for discriminating major tissue components. for this, we minimize j, i.e. the overlap between the representations of the reference categories. at the same time, we require tight clusters ) and sparse representation . hence, the desired value for k is the one that maximizes Ψ, where we note that the first term is constant  and that the scaling factor  <dig>  is used to reduce the influence of k.

image recoding
once a suitable k is found and a codebook is constructed by k-means clustering, the standard bag-of-feature approach represents the images as codeblock histograms. however, in this coding, all spatial information about the distribution of the codeblocks is lost. consider the situation in fig. 1a: all four images have the same number of patches assigned to the same codeblock, but the spatial arrangement is very different. in order to characterize these spatial differences, we extend the image representation with a number of statistics on the distribution of the codeblocks. for a given image and for each codeblock k∈{ <dig> …,k}, we construct a binary image in which 1s represent regions assigned to the codeblock and 0s everything else. in these binary images, the connected components  define individual objects and for each of them we compute the area  and the compactness index . finally, for each image and each codeblock, we compute  the median area,  the maximum area,  the ratio of the maximum area to the total area of the objects,  the skewness of the distribution of the area values and  the mean compactness. thus, for each codeblock in an image, aside from its frequency, we add five new values aimed at characterizing the distribution of the codeblock in the image. we will refer to these additional quantities as the “extended set of features”. the final representation of an image has a length of 6k: k values for the codeblock histogram  and 5k values of the extended representation.

joint data mining
the new representation of the images allows for direct application of standard data mining techniques. in the case of multi-modality data mining, the choice of a proper similarity metric/measure is of crucial importance. two main strategies may be attempted for defining a proper similarity: combination of single, modality-specific, metrics or building/learning a fully multi-modality metric. the first approach has the advantage of using established metrics usually resulting in easily interpretable models and facilitating the comparison with known results. the second approach promises to build a similarity metric that better exploits the multi-modality nature of the data. these ideas can be implemented, for example, in the context of kernel machines  where composite kernels  would represent a possible implementation of the first approach and multiple kernel learning  <cit>  an implementation of the latter.

in the present work and in order to demonstrate the general analytical framework, we make use of standard statistical tools. we aim at identifying image features that could be linked to expression levels of the genes of interest  and potential image biomarkers that alone or in combination with gene expression can be used for defining a prognostic signature. besides the gene expression, we also used a proliferation gene signature pro_ <dig>  <cit> , which was shown to be prognostic in various cohorts of patients with breast cancer.

to test the association between image features and tumor size  and grade  we dichotomized the clinical variables  and used two-sided t-test, with  <dig>  significance level. the association of image features with gene expression was assessed based on correlation test  with significance level  <dig>  and the condition that the correlation coefficient was at least  <dig>  . we also used canonical correlation analysis  to study the associations between image features and molecular data with significance level of  <dig>  for wilks’ test. the association between image features and survival outcome  was tested using cox proportional hazard models , with significance level of  <dig> . the hazard ratios were estimated from interquartile range-standardized variables . to test if an image feature improves the prognostic value of the gene signature, we tested the difference between the models with and without the variable of interest using likelihood ratio tests. to assess the difference in survival between two groups we used log-rank tests. we binarized the variables by their median value, into high- and low- expressions or values. since the work reported here is purely exploratory and the sample size is rather small, no adjustment for multiple hypotheses testing was performed. we used hierarchical clustering  with euclidean distance between samples to cluster the codeblocks.

all statistical analyses were performed in r package for statistical computing  version  <dig> . <dig> 

RESULTS
codebook
the image analysis methods described above were implemented in a python package , using the scikit-image  <cit>  and mahotas  <cit>  libraries.

for the codebook construction we used only the modeling set of images, none of the image used in the data mining phase being used for learning the codebook. from each image, a set of  <dig> random patches of size 32× <dig> was extracted and the corresponding gabor descriptors computed . these descriptor vectors were clustered using the k-means algorithm to build the codebooks. we estimated the optimal  codebook size by evaluating Ψ for k= <dig> ,…, <dig>  the optimal value was found to be k= <dig> ) leading to  <dig> feature vectors for each image. since the codeblocks are centers of the clusters , they might not necessarily correspond to observed image regions. thus we selected the closest regions to the codeblocks  to provide an approximate visual representation of the codebook - fig. 1b. in the following, to designate a specific codeblock from the codebook, we will use the notation c.xy. we have extensively investigated the stability of the learned codebooks and the resulting image representations and we found the process to be stable – see additional file  <dig> 

the hierarchical clustering of the codeblocks  revealed a rather structured content: three major groups of codeblocks could be identified. we tentatively labeled them as “proliferation patterns”, “invasion/differentiation patterns/connective tissue” and “sparse tumor nuclei/differentiation/fat” to indicate the major components in the clusters - without claiming a precise histopathological characterization.
fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of the codebook. clustering the codeblocks led to identification of three major clusters, to which generic terms have been assigned. the codeblocks correlated with gene expression are marked with red dots. the codeblocks with potential prognostic value  are marked with blue squares  and grade .

correlations between image features and gene expression
the association analysis between image features and gene expression identified a number of significant  pairwise correlations . in all, eight different codeblocks were associated with different genes, most of them with ccne <dig> and ccnb <dig>  the codeblock c. <dig> was associated with most genes  either by its frequency of appearance in the image or by the skewness of its distribution. by summing the frequencies corresponding to image features that are highly correlated  the correlations coefficients were improved to  <dig> − <dig> . cca confirmed the association between these image features and gene expression data . the image features c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  and c. <dig> and the genes ccne <dig>  ccnb <dig>  and spag <dig> had the strongest impact on the canonical dimensions. these were also the most stable image features-gene expression correlations in the image representation stability experiments – see additional file  <dig> 

despite the fact that the pro_ <dig> gene signature is an average of proliferation genes which were found to be correlated with image features, the correlations between image features and pro_ <dig> did not reach the required significance level in all but one case: the skewness of codeblock c. <dig> 

survival analyses
the goal of the analyses performed was to assess the utility of image-based variables for predicting relapse-free survival independently, or combined with the pro_ <dig> signature. in the set of samples analyzed, the genomic score is a strong prognostic marker ).

univariate cox proportional hazards models were fit for each of the  <dig> image features resulting in the identification of several significant associations with relapse-free survival endpoint. the most prognostic image features were c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  with p< <dig>  and hr between  <dig>  and  <dig> . from the extended set of features, the median area of the regions assigned to clusters c. <dig> and c. <dig> were significantly associated with rfs . the strongest predictor among the image features was c. <dig> ).

in combined models  a number of image features led to improved models , most of them from the extended set of features. from all these image features, c. <dig> remained significant in the multivariate model  and had no significant interaction with the genomic signature.

we defined an image score variable by averaging c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig>  c. <dig> which resulted in a stronger prognostic factor  - see also figure 3). in a regression model including the genomic and the image scores, both remained independent significant variables  and the model was signficantly better than the corresponding univariate models . in fig.  <dig> the kaplan-meier curves for binarized  scores are shown, together with corresponding p-values  and hazard ratios. another visualization of the prognostic scores is given in fig.  <dig> where the expected survival at  <dig> years is shown as a function of the genomic, image-based, and combined scores, respectively. two examples of high risk cases, according to the image-based score, are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>

discussion
the main challenge in introducing the histopathology images in the general data mining biomarker discovery framework stems from their high complexity and low level of information representation. thus, while the images contain a huge amount of data  the extraction of information implies a considerable effort. traditionally, this effort is performed by the expert pathologists or, more recently, by using quantitative methods for measuring a set of predefined morphological aspects to complement the pathology report. in this work, we took a third approach, in which the image data is reduced to a number of essential patterns  whose frequency and spatial distribution in the image is used for data mining. the codeblocks are learned independent of any prior knowledge about the images, potentially enabling the discovery of new image features not necessarily assessed during the pathology review of the cases. the obvious drawback is the difficulty of interpreting some of the patterns and the possibility of having also artifacts in the model. the adopted representation of local neighborhoods in the image  encouraged the identification of codeblocks with distinctive textural appearance . this local appearance may be later on combined with a nuclei detector and classifier , for example, to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of the image.

by examining the similarities between codeblocks, we identified three major aspects of the images that are captured: proliferation, invasion/differentiation  and isolated tumor nuclei  . this result combined with the observation that the whole third cluster did not contribute to the prognostic models, suggests a possible refinement of the current method, in which these regions with high fat content are discarded in an initial preprocessing stage and a more detailed model is used to characterize the remaining regions.

we demonstrated the integration of the image features in a standard biomarker discovery scenario, in which both image-genes correlations  as well as various survival prognostic models were tested. since the main purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate the integration of image features with genomic information and the sample size was relatively modest, we did not adjust for multiple hypotheses testing and restricted ourselves to an exploratory analysis. thus the associations found, while hypothesis-generating, have to be taken with caution and more validation is needed.

most of the genes in the panel were related to proliferation processes, thus it is not surprising that the correlations with image features involved almost exclusively these genes. the strongest associations were found with ccne <dig> and ccnb <dig>  somehow surprising, no significant correlation was found with mki <dig> gene, a common marker  for proliferation.

a number of image features were found to be prognostic for rfs and we proposed a simple image-based prognostic score which averages five basic image features. the new score is strongly prognostic and is not correlated with the genomic score considered . when combining the two scores in a multivariable cox regression, the two remained significant  and independent predictors  leading to an improved model. thus, the image-based score can be used either alone - as a first line predictor - or in combination with the genomic predictor. these results also demonstrate the complementarity of the two modalities - histopathology imaging and genomics - and suggest that refined predictors can be built by a combination thereof.

it must be noted that the sample size and the number of events did not allow for more variables in the regression models. further analysis of the scores  in the context of usual clinical predictors  is required before a definite conclusion about its clinical utility can be drawn. nevertheless, the image-based score can already be used in applications like searching or indexing in histopathology image archives.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed a general framework for integrating the histopathology images in the routine genomic data analysis pipeline. the image features used are based on the responses of gabor filters applied to single channel images. the approach can easily be extended to exploit the full color information and to include other types of features.

when applying our method to a data collection of breast cancer samples, we were able to identify a number of associations between image features and gene expression levels. more importantly, several prognostic image features were identified, some of them complementary to the genomic score. thus, we could build an image-based and a combined survival score, improving on the performance of the genomic score. these results must be validated in larger data sets.
