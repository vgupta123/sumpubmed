BACKGROUND
meiosis is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. it not only generates genetic diversity on which natural selection can act, but also helps maintain the immortality of the germ line
 <cit> . in mammals, meiosis is initiated at different time points in males and females. recent discoveries indicate that the key to this sex-specific timing of meiosis entry is the presence or absence of the signaling molecule ra 
 <cit> . in mouse, a model was proposed in which ra signaling and metabolism regulate whether female and male germ cells initiate meiosis during embryogenesis. the model posits that, in embryonic ovaries, ra induces germ cells to express stra <dig>  which in turn leads to meiotic initiation. in embryonic testes, an enzyme of the cyp <dig> family, likely cyp26b <dig>  degrades ra and thereby prevents expression of stra <dig> and precludes meiotic initiation
 <cit> . in avians and amphibians, the role of ra in meiotic initiation is similar to that in mammals showing that ra-dependent meiosis entry could be a conserved mechanism of germ cell differentiation in tetrapods
 <cit> .

stra <dig> which was first identified in a screen for genes induced by ra is specifically expressed in mammalian germ cells before their transition from mitosis to meiosis
 <cit> . studies on the teratocarcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells  transfected with stra8-egfp shown that the positive cells may undergo meiosis develop into sperm and generate live offspring mice
 <cit> . in female embryos lacking stra <dig> gene function, the early mitotic development of germ cells is normal, but these cells then fail to undergo premeiotic dna replication, meiotic chromosome condensation, cohesion, synapsis and recombination
 <cit> . analysis of stra8-deficient testes of mice demonstrated that stra <dig> is essential for normal progression into meiotic prophase
 <cit> . above all, stra <dig> is the key factor involved in ra signal pathway in the control of germ cell meiosis.

the role of stra <dig> in the meiosis of teleost has not yet been reported. some researchers even suspected that stra <dig> may be amniote- or even mammalian-specific, according to ensemble orthologue prediction 
 <cit> . in the present study, homologous sequences of stra <dig> were isolated from channel catfish, rainbow trout and salmon in est database, and stra <dig> cdna was cloned from s. meridionalis. the spatial and temporal expression patterns of stra <dig> were examined by rt-pcr, real-time pcr, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. the study shows for the first time that stra <dig> is expressed highest in the premeiotic phase of germ cell in s. meridionalis. our data indicated that stra <dig> may be involved in meiotic initiation of s. meridionalis.

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of s. meridionalis stra <dig> cdna
using degenerated pcr amplification, a cdna fragment of  <dig> bp was obtained and was confirmed to be a partial sequence of s. meridionalis stra <dig> gene by homology search in the genbank database. the full length cdna of stra <dig> was successfully isolated by race-pcr. stra <dig> cdna  was  <dig> bp in length containing an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp, corresponding to  <dig> amino acid residues and the 5’ and 3’ utrs of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the predicted molecular mass and pi value of the deduced stra <dig> protein were  <dig> kda and  <dig> , respectively.

amino acid sequence alignment
alignment of the s. meridionalis stra <dig> with those from other organisms revealed a low identity, especially in the n-terminal regions . the overall similarity between fish and tetrapods stra <dig> is very low, averagely less than 30%. it shared 28% similarity with h. sapiens , 29% with m. musculus  and m. gallopavo , 30% with g. gallus , 27% with a. carolinensis , and 23% with x. tropicalis . however, s. meridionalis stra <dig> shared 75% with i. punctatus, and 44% with o. mykiss, respectively. there are three motifs  relatively conserved among all stra <dig>  box <dig> is the most important and conserved signature motif. all fish share the same  <dig> amino acid sequences in this motif while only  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acid residues differ between stra <dig> from fish and tetrapods.

phylogenetic analysis of stra8
phylogenetic analysis of stra <dig> from representative cephalochordate, fish, amphibians, reptiles, avians and mammals  produced an nj-phylogenetic tree that contained three distinct branches. the s. meridionalis stra <dig> clustered with those of fish, while sequences from tetrapod and cephalochordate formed a separate cluster, respectively.

tissue distribution by rt-pcr
in adult s. meridionalis, stra <dig> was found to be exclusively expressed in gonads, with much higher expression in the testis compared with the ovary .

expression profiles of stra <dig> in gonads by real-time pcr
as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the relative expression of stra <dig> mrna was at the highest level in  <dig> dah ovaries and  <dig> dah testes, corresponding to the premeiotic stage of germ cells, and at lower levels in  <dig> and  <dig> dah ovaries as well  <dig> and  <dig> dah testes.

localization of stra <dig> in gonads
morphological observation of gonads by h.e. staining
to observe the germ cell meiosis in female and male gonads, h.e. staining was performed using ovaries at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dah and testes at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dah. the results showed that ovaries at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dah were mainly composed of premeiotic oogonia and primary oocytes, respectively; while testes at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dah, were basically composed of synchronized spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes . the results also showed that the majority germ cells are in the premeiotic phase in  <dig> dah ovaries and testes <dig> dah.

expression, purification, and western blot analysis
recombinant stra <dig> protein with a his-tag at its n terminus was successfully expressed in e. coli. unpurified and purified recombinant stra <dig> proteins were analyzed by sds-page with coomassie blue staining . the specificity of the stra <dig> antibody was confirmed by western blotting. specific bands of  <dig> kda corresponding to the calculated molecular weights of the s. meridionalis stra <dig> fusion proteins and total proteins extracted from  <dig> dah ovaries and  <dig> dah testes were recognized using our own stra <dig> antibody .

cell types of stra8/stra <dig> in gonads by ish and ihc
to identify the localization of stra8/stra <dig> in gonads, ish and ihc was performed using ovaries at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dah and testes at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dah. the results showed that specific signals of stra8/stra <dig> were observed in germ cells in gonads of both sexes. weak mrna and protein signals were detected in  <dig> dah ovaries and  <dig> dah testes . strong signals were found in premeiotic germ cells in  <dig> dah ovaries and  <dig> dah testes . the signals became weaker in the  <dig> dah ovary and  <dig> dah testes . the positive signal corresponds to the brownish color . no signal was detected in the negative control without the primary antibody .

discussion
in this study, the full length cdna of the stra <dig> was cloned and characterized in a teleost, s. meridionalis, for the first time. stra <dig> sequences were found to be poorly conserved among vertebrates. according to the phylogenetic tree, stra <dig> might be existed in the common ancestor of cephalochordate and vertebrate. it is speculated that like in tetrapods stra <dig> may be widespread in teleosts. however, in teleosts, stra <dig> was not found in the genome databases of zebrafish, medaka, fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and nile tilapia. stra <dig> sequences were only isolated from siluriformes and salmoniformes by bioinformatics analysis of available databases. there are two possibilities for this, 1) it is difficult to identify stra <dig> from other fish species because of the very low sequence similarity; 2) stra <dig> is not included in the databases because of incomplete genome sequencing.

in mammals, stra <dig> was expressed in embryonic ovaries just before meiotic initiation, whereas its expression in testes was first detected after birth
 <cit> . in this study, tissue distribution analysis showed that stra <dig> was specifically expressed in gonads of both sexes of adult s. meridionalis. in mouse, moderate levels of stra <dig> transcript in gonocytes and the peak of stra <dig> mrna expression coincided with the onset of meiosis in postnatal testes. stra <dig> mrna levels were greatly reduced or absent in germ cells once they entered meiosis by microarrays
 <cit> . interestingly, in this study real-time pcr showed that stra <dig> was expressed at the highest level in ovaries at  <dig> dah and testes at  <dig> dah. in addition, our previous work showed that meiosis of germ cell in s. meridionalis initiated at about  <dig> dah, whereas meiosis of male germ cells initiated at about  <dig> dah
 <cit> . this unique expression pattern made us curious to examine the cellular localizations of stra <dig> transcripts and protein in gonads. ish and ihc analysis revealed that stra8/stra <dig> signals were only observed in germ cells. consistant with the real-time pcr results, strongest signals were detected in ovaries at  <dig> dah and testes at  <dig> dah, respectively. furthermore, hemotoxylin-eosin  staining verified that the majority of germ cells in  <dig> dah ovaries and in  <dig> dah testes were in the premeiotic phase. these results suggest that stra <dig> may play an important role in meiotic initiation in s. meridionalis.

it is well document that meiosis is initiated through retinoic acid induction of stra <dig> in both male and female germ lines in higher vertebrates
 <cit> . there is also evidence for similar role of ra in germ cell meiotic initiation in amphibians
 <cit> . in addition, cyp26b <dig>  an ra catabolic enzyme, was proved to regulate germ cell fate in a manner common among vertebrates in japanese flounder
 <cit> . long term treatment of xx nile tilapia with citral, an ra synthetase inhibitor, from  <dig> dah resulted in female to male sex reversal . in the present study, we showed evidence for possible involvement of stra <dig>  the key factor for ra signal pathway, in germ cell meiotic initiation in s. meridionalis. taken together, these data strongly suggest that ra may play important roles in germ cell meiotic initiation in teleosts as it did in tetrapods.

CONCLUSIONS
stra <dig> cdna full-length was successfully cloned from s. meridionalis. sequence and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that it is the genuine counterpart of mammalian stra <dig>  tissue distribution analysis revealed that it was exclusively expressed in the gonad. real-time pcr, ish and ihc analyses showed that it was highly expressed in the premeiotic phase of germ cells in both ovaries and testes. these results indicated that stra <dig> probably participated in meiotic initiation in s. meridionalis as it did in higher vertebrates. stra <dig> is the key factor in ra induced germ cell meiotic initiation. together with the results from japanese flounder and tetrapods, we conclude that ra-dependent meiotic initiation might be a conserved mechanism of germ cell differentiation in vertebrates.
