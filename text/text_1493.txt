BACKGROUND
cellular respiration is the process for producing adenosine triphosphate  and enables cells to obtain energy from foods. during cellular respiration, cells break down food molecules, such as sugar, and release energy. the objective of cellular respiration is to harvest electrons from organic compounds to create atp, which is used to provide energy for most cellular reactions. figure  <dig> shows the architecture of the cellular respiration process.fig.  <dig> cellular respiration process



as cells undergo cellular respiration, they require a pathway to store and transport electrons . the electron transport chain components are organized into four complexes  and atp synthase . the process of electron transport chain starts from the mitochondrial inner membrane, which electrons transfer from complex i with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  and succinate  to oxygen. in the next step, a carrier  that embeds in the cell membrane receives electrons from complex i and pass to complex iii . electrons bypass complex ii, the succinate dehydrogenase complex, which is an independent starting stage and is not a component of the nadh pathway. the pathway from complex iii leads to cytochrome c then moves to complex iv . in the final step, atp synthase is active by the proton electrochemical to utilize the flow of h+ to generate atp, which provides energy in numerous cellular processes.

flavin adenine dinucleotide is one of the most vital molecules in the electron transport chain. it is mainly in complex ii, which is an enzyme complex bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane of mammalian mitochondria and many bacterial cells. regarding the reaction mechanism of complex ii, succinate is bound and a hydride is transferred to fad to generate fadh <dig>  after the electrons are derived from succinate oxidation through fad, they tunnel along the  relay to the  cluster. these electrons are subsequently transferred to an awaiting ubiquinone molecule within the active site. the fundamental role of complex ii in the electron transfer chain of mitochondria renders it vital in most organisms, and removing complex ii from the genome has been shown to be lethal at the embryonic stage in mice.

predicting fad binding sites in electron transporters is vital for helping biologists clearly understand the operating mechanisms of the electron transport chain and complex ii. in this study, we developed a method that is based on position specific scoring matrix  profiles and significant amino acid pairs  for identifying fad binding residues in electron transport proteins.

fad binding sites have attracted the interest of numerous researchers because of their relevance in electron transport chains. prominent studies conducted on fad binding sites include those by mishra and raghava  <cit>  and fang  <cit> . mishra and raghava  <cit>  used support vector machines to predict fad binding residues. they also developed a free web server for identifying fad binding residues in specific sequences. moreover, fang  <cit>  used evolutionary information to improve the prediction performance.

numerous studies have also been conducted on transport proteins. for example, saier  <cit>  provided a web database containing the sequence, classification, structural, and evolutionary information of transport systems from various living organisms. furthermore, ren  <cit>  presented transportdb, which is a comprehensive database of transporters and outer membrane channels. chen  <cit>  divided electron transport targets into four types of transport proteins to conduct prediction and analysis. after the prediction and analysis, chen classified the transport proteins and determined the functions of each protein type in the transport protein. ou  <cit>  attempted to discriminate metal-binding sites in electron transport by using radial basis function networks .

the current study proposes an approach based on pssm profiles and saaps for identifying fad binding sites in electron transport proteins. we used a set of  <dig> fad binding proteins as the training data set and six fad binding proteins in electron transport proteins as an independent data set. we applied the independent data set to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which demonstrated an accuracy of  <dig>  %. compared with the general fad binding predictor developed by mishra and raghava, the proposed method exhibited a 9 %–45 % improvement in accuracy and matthew’s correlation coefficient  of  <dig> – <dig>  when applied to two newly discovered electron transport protein sequences. the proposed method also reduces the number of false positives significantly and offers useful information for biologists. the proposed method can serve as an effective tool for predicting fad binding sites in electron transport proteins and can help biologists understand electron transport chain functions, particularly those of fad binding sites.

methods
this study focused on identifying fad binding sites in electron transport proteins. figure  <dig> illustrates a flowchart of the study, which included three subprocesses in each phase: data collection, feature set generation, and model evaluation. according to this flowchart, we developed a novel approach that is based on pssm profiles and saaps for predicting fad binding sites in electron transport proteins. the details of the proposed approach are described as follows.fig.  <dig> flowchart of the proposed method for identifying fad binding sites in electron transport proteins



data set
first, we collected data about transport proteins and electron transport proteins from the uniprot  <cit>  database. subsequently, we removed sequences without the annotation “evidence at protein level” or “complete.” after this exclusion,  <dig> transport proteins and  <dig> electron transport proteins remained and were surveyed. next, we retrieved all fad binding sites in the electron transport proteins. we collected data on only nine fad binding proteins. however, creating a precise model requires using a higher number of proteins; thus, we collected data on additional general fad binding proteins from other sources. we retrieved data from the gene ontology   <cit>  and protein data bank   <cit>  databases by using the molecular function of fad binding. in the go database, we applied three molecular functions of fad binding: go: <dig> , go: <dig> , and go: <dig> . from these three molecular functions, we obtained data on a total of  <dig> fad binding proteins. we applied the same approach to the pdb database and obtained data on a total of  <dig> fad binding proteins. we removed duplicated proteins and  <dig> general fad binding proteins remained. next, blast  <cit>  was applied to exclude sequences with a sequence identity of more than 40 % from the data set. finally,  <dig> fad binding proteins were used in this study .table  <dig> statistics of all retrieved fad binding proteins with fad and non-fad binding sites



we divided the collected protein sequences into two data sets: training and independent test data sets. in this phase, the training data set was used for identifying fad binding sites, and the independent test data set was used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. we used all six fad binding proteins in the electron transport chain as the independent data set; thus, the training data set comprised  <dig> general fad proteins . table  <dig> lists the details of all data sets.table  <dig> details of all  <dig> fad binding proteins with a uniprot id in the present study 



sequence information
sequence information is one of the first features set in predicting the secondary structure of proteins  <cit> . in this feature, each amino acid sequence is represented by a number  <dig> or  <dig>  creating a binary matrix. from the binary matrix, the value for each amino acid can be calculated. for example, if the sequence of amino acids is arndcqeghilkmfpswyv and the value for amino acid n must be calculated, the third position is set to  <dig> and the others are set to  <dig>  in this study, we also used two types of advance sequence information, namely pam <dig> and blosum <dig> 

pam250
a percent accepted mutation   <cit>  matrix represents the elements involved in the conversion of amino acids into amino acids within a variable probability of evolutionary distance. a pam matrix was created in the protein sequence alignment and various phylogenetic trees with the assumption that amino acids are amino acids and that each amino acid is substituted with another amino acid, to establish an acceptable point mutation matrix .

a matrix is usually employed to mark aligned peptide sequences in order to identify the similarity of such sequences. by comparing aligned protein sequences with a known homology and determining the “accepted point mutations”, the aforementioned numbers were derived. the frequencies of such mutations were arranged in a table as a “log odds matrix”: mij=10log10rij, where mij is the matrix component and rij is the probability of that substitution, then divided by the standardized frequency of amino acid sequences. note that all the numbers are rounded to the integer number. the base- <dig> log is utilized so that the numbers can be added instead of multiplied to decide the score of a practical set of sequences.

blosum62
the block substitution matrix   <cit>  is used to assess differences in effectiveness between evolutions of protein sequence alignment methods. they are retrieved from the blocks database, and some of the protein amino acid sequences are retained; the calculated relative amino acid is replaced by the calculated frequency and probability. a blosum <dig> matrix is commonly collected in a database sequence blocks with 62 % sequence similarity, and the sequence is then deduced from a score matrix.

pssm profiles
pssm is a matrix commonly used for representing motifs in biological sequences  <cit> . it is a matrix of score values and provides a weighted match to any specific substring of fixed length. this matrix has one row for each letter of the alphabet and one column for each position in the pattern.

in recent years, the pssm has widely been considered an indicator of the properties of protein sequences. the pssm is used in determining the evolution of sequence information in a specific location as well as the amino acid replacement ratio to identify protein sequences; such sequences represent the original  <dig> amino acid types in the protein and are used to replace an amino acid with its degree of influence. the pssm has been extensively used for predicting the secondary structure of proteins as well as subcellular locations and other biological information, and it has been reported to produce favorable results.

we collected all sequence data from blast  <cit>  and the non-redundant protein database and used them to establish the sequences in a pssm. after the pssm sequences were established, we calculated the optimal protein sequence for each amino acid. we placed  <dig> types of amino acids in the calculated sequences, leading to the creation of a matrix. if a window size of  <dig> is used, then the matrix size is  <dig> * 20 =  <dig> . this matrix should be added to predict the properties of the protein sequence. identical amino acid residues can be replaced with a specific value of amino acids. we used the following numerical normalization formula to convert the values to values between  <dig> and 1: fx=11+exp‐x 

f-score
in binary classification analysis, an f-score is a simple parameter applied for measuring the accuracy of a test by using two sets of real numbers  <cit> . the f-score is defined as follows: fi=x¯i+−x¯i2+x¯i−−x¯i21n+−1∑k=1n+xk,i+−x¯i+2+1n−−1∑k=1n−xk,i−−x¯i+ <dig> where n+ is the number of positive instances and n− is the number of negative instances. furthermore, x¯i,x¯i+, and x¯i− are the averages of the ith feature of the entire, positive, and negative data sets, respectively; xk,i is the ith feature of the kth positive instance; and xk,i is the ith feature of the kth negative instance. we calculated all f-score values for all feature sets of fad binding sites in electron transport proteins. a higher f-score indicates that the corresponding feature has a higher amount of special information. therefore, we added the f-score values to the pssm features. in this study, we added the  <dig> highest f-scores to the pssm features.

significant amino acid pairs
we adopted saaps to improve the performance of the proposed method in predicting fad binding sites in electron transport proteins. the saaps around the fad binding sites were identified on the basis of six fad binding proteins, and the remaining saaps were identified on the basis of a statistical distribution measurement. each amino acid pair surrounding fad binding sites was calculated using a p-value: p‐valuek=mxn‐mn‐xnn, where n denotes the number of sequences in the entire data set, m denotes the number of sequences in the positive data set, and  denotes the number of sequences in the negative data set; n, x, and n-x denote the number of sequences including a kth saap in the entire data set, positive data set, and negative data set. figure  <dig> shows the method used for calculating the p-value from fad binding sites in electron transport chains.fig.  <dig> proposed method for calculating initial saap values



a p-value less than  <dig>  indicates that the amino acid pair surrounding fad binding sites is significant. that is, numerous special features exist, with some features having a p-value less than  <dig> . after we calculated the p-values for all amino acid pairs surrounding fad binding sites with a window size of  <dig>  we added the ranked saaps to the feature set in descending order. finally,  <dig> saaps were added to the feature set of fad binding sites in electron transport proteins.

radial basis function networks
we employed the quickrbf package  <cit>  to construct rbfn classifiers. figure  <dig> shows the architecture of the rbf network. furthermore, we assigned a constant bandwidth of  <dig> for each kernel function in the network. we also used all training data as centers. subsequently, the rbfn classifier was used to identify fad binding sites according to the output function value. we explained the details of the network structure and design in our previous article  <cit> .fig.  <dig> architecture of the rbfn



rbfn-based classifications have been used in several applications in bioinformatics to predict cleavage sites in proteins  <cit> , interresidue contacts  <cit> , and protein disorder  <cit> ; furthermore, they have been applied for discriminating β-barrel proteins  <cit> , classifying transporters  <cit> , identifying o-linked glycosylation sites  <cit> , and identifying ubiquitin conjugation sites  <cit> .

the general mathematical form of output nodes in an rbfn is expressed as follows: gjx=∑i=1kwjiφx−μiσi; where gj is the function corresponding to the jth output node and is a linear combination of k radial basis functions φ with center mi and bandwidth si; in addition, wji is the weight associated with the correlation between the jth output node.

assessment of predictive ability
we measured the predictive performance of the proposed method by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and mcc metrics. tp, fp, tn, and fn represent true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative, respectively.

sensitivity
this parameter enables computing the percentage of accurately predicted fad binding sites. sensitivity=tptp+fn 

specificity
this parameter enables computing the percentage of accurately predicted non-fad binding sites. specificity=tntn+fp 

accuracy
this parameter enables computing the percentage of accurately predicted fad and non-fad binding sites. accuracy=tp+tntp+fp+tn+fn 

mcc
this parameter represents the quality of prediction and is used for resolving imbalance in data sets. an mcc value of  <dig> indicates a perfect prediction. mcc=tp×tn‐fp×fntp+fptp+fntn+fptn+fn 

RESULTS
amino acid composition analysis
we analyzed the composition of interacting and non-interacting fad binding sites by computing the occurrence frequency of amino acids in these sites. regarding the interacting fad binding sites, the amino acids g, s, a, and t exhibited the significantly highest occurrence frequency in two interaction instances  . we inferred that glycine is vital for the interaction with fad binding sites. regarding non-interacting binding sites, the amino acids a, l, and g exhibited the highest occurrence frequency in both instances.fig.  <dig> amino acid composition of fad binding interacting residues and noninteracting residues in  <dig> general fad binding proteins

performance in predicting fad binding sites in electron transport proteins by using various window sizes
we created an fad binding classifier by using the  <dig> fad binding proteins collected. we applied the quickrbf classifier by using window sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> for comparison . we measured the predictive performance of the proposed pssm-based method. as shown in table  <dig>  changing the window size did not exert considerable effects on the result. the result obtained when the window size was set to  <dig> was favorable, and the measured sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and mcc were approximately  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig> , respectively. although the mcc was low, all the other performance metrics were approximately  <dig>  we used the experiment with a window size of  <dig> to create the fad binding classifier model.table  <dig> comparison of performance in identifying fad binding sites in the electron transport chain with different window sizes



as shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  the sequence frequency logo was generated using a tool provided by the weblogo server  <cit> . the window size was set to  <dig> and used to confirm the fad binding fragment for comparison. these two figures indicate that some differences exist between the general fad binding proteins and fad binding proteins in the electron transport chain. for example, the amino acids t, k, i, and r exhibited clear differences at positions ranging from − <dig> to − <dig> fig.  <dig> sequence logo for  <dig> general fad binding proteins

we compared the performance of the proposed method with that of the fadpred approach presented by mishra and raghava  <cit> . in this comparison, in addition to the six fad binding proteins in the electron transport chain, we used two new proteins, namely q96he <dig> and a3kez <dig>  which have been demonstrated in experiments conducted after  <dig>  we subsequently evaluated the results of the proposed method in analyzing these two proteins and compared them with results of the fadpred approach  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the comparison results, indicating that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance relative to the fadpred method  <cit> .table  <dig> comparison of performance in identifying fad binding sites in two newly discovered proteins



identification of new fad binding sites in electron transport protein
in this part, we applied our method for prediction of fad binding sites in electron transport human proteins. the testing dataset retrieved from swiss-prot  <cit> , which is a famous protein database. after using blast to remove sequence similarity more than  <dig> %, the rest of dataset contained  <dig> proteins, which including  <dig> amino acids. then our model can found  <dig> fad binding sites from dataset. thus our research can help biologists discover some new fad binding sites in electron transport proteins.

web server for predicting fad binding sites in electron transport protein
the web server fad-etc.-rbf was built for presenting our method in this study. fad-etc.-rbf trained for the identification of fad binding sites in electron transport proteins by using quickrbf classification based on pssm profiles and saaps. the web server can be access at http:// <dig> . <dig> /~kahn/bioinformatics/. we developed friendly web interface including many page menus that users can easily use to retrieve information and submit their sequences. moreover, the users just wait for the short time to receive the prediction result because the performance of this server is especially fast. in the result page, users can easily check the results because the amino acids predicted were displayed as different colors. according to this web server, biologists can discover new fad binding sites in electron transport protein to understand clearly the operating mechanism of electron transport chains.

CONCLUSIONS
predicting fad binding sites in electron transporters is vital in helping biologists clearly understand the operating mechanisms of electron transport chains and complex ii. in this study, we developed a method based on pssm profiles and saaps for identifying fad binding residues in electron transport proteins. we used the independent data set to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which achieved an accuracy of  <dig>  %. we compared the performance of the proposed method in analyzing two newly discovered electron transport protein sequences with that of the general fadpred approach of mishra and raghava. we observed that the accuracy of the proposed method improved by 9 %–45 % and its mcc was  <dig> – <dig> . the proposed method can serve as an effective tool for predicting fad binding sites in electron transport proteins and can help biologists understand the functions of the electron transport chain, particularly those fad binding sites. we also developed a web server for the method described in this paper.

the contributions of this study provide a basis for further research that can enrich the field. however, this study still has some limitations related to the small sample size and limited time. the number of suitable fad binding proteins in electron transport chains was not sufficient, potentially affecting the performance of the proposed method. to create a more effective model, we must identify additional fad binding proteins in electron transport proteins. doing so can enable us to conduct a comparative study and enhance prediction performance.
