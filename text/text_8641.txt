BACKGROUND
fatty acids are required by daily normal metabolism, and can be obtained from food and meat. improving nutritional value of meat products for human health has attracted extensive attention in current society  <cit> . fat content and fatty acid composition in beef products are associated with meat taste and flavor, and these are considered as main sensory properties in consumer’s selection and acceptance  <cit> .

fatty acids are important indicators of beef meat quality, and previous studies have been conducted to examine fatty acids for various cattle breeds in different feeding environments  <cit> . fatty acid composition are often lowly or moderately heritable traits in various populations with different genetic architecture  <cit> . several studies have revealed that the level of heritability and genetic correlation theoretically allow for genetic improvement of fatty acid composition by selection of both major candidate genes and genomic selection strategies . therefore, application of molecular genetics approaches can provide an opportunity for genetic improvement for fatty acid composition of beef cattle .

during the last decades, tremendous works have been done to elucidate the genetic mechanism of fatty acids using candidate gene  and linkage mapping approaches . in recent years, genome-wide association studies  have been widely used to study the molecular mechanism underlying important traits in beef and dairy cattle . previous gwas and genomic predictions have identified candidate markers associated with various fatty acid composition and evaluated the accuracy of genomic prediction for these traits . however, many studies were conducted in populations with relatively low density snp arrays. despite recent gwas for fatty acid composition have been investigated using the high density bovinehd  snp array, those studies were mostly limited in nellore cattle  <cit> . on the other hand, extensive attention has been paid to investigate the accuracies of genomic prediction using multiple methods in different populations  <cit> . a recent study in nellore cattle indicated that the accuracies of genomic prediction were moderate to high and it was feasible to apply genomic selection in cattle. however, their results were limited to carcass traits in nellore population  <cit> . therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying fatty acid composition and evaluating the accuracy of genomic predictions in other important cattle breeds still need further investigation.

the objectives of the current study were to explore the associated genomic regions and estimate the predictive accuracies for fatty acid composition using the bovinehd snp array in chinese simmental population. in this study, we identified several potential candidate markers and genes associated with fatty acid composition. our findings will facilitate the elucidation of the molecular mechanism and help us design optimal genomic selection strategies for fatty acid composition in cattle and other farm animals.

RESULTS
descriptive statistics of fatty acid composition and their estimates of heritability
we measured six saturated fatty acids , four monounsaturated fatty acids  and eleven polyunsaturated fatty acids  using gas chromatography. descriptive statistics and estimates of heritability for  <dig> individual fatty acids were presented in table  <dig>  we observed that the most abundant individual saturated fatty acids were c16: <dig>  and c18: <dig> , while for monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, relatively high proportions of individual fatty acids were c18: <dig> cis- <dig>  and c18: <dig> n- <dig> . in contrast, we found saturated fatty acids , monounsaturated fatty acids , and polyunsaturated fatty acids  accounted for relatively low proportion  of the total fatty acids. in this study, our results found the estimated heritability varied noticeably for these fatty acids. among  <dig> individual fatty acids, we found only c14: <dig> showed a relatively high heritability at  <dig>  and five fatty acids including c18: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c14: <dig> cis- <dig>  c16: <dig> cis- <dig> and c18: <dig> cis- <dig> showed a moderate heritability, while most of heritability estimates for others fatty acids  were below  <dig>  . for the eight groups of fatty acids, we found mufa, n-6/n- <dig> and health index  showed moderate heritabilities , while the estimated heritability for sfa, pufa, total of omega  <dig> , total of omega  <dig>  were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.table  <dig> summary statistics of mean , standard deviation  and heritability estimates , additive genetic variance and coefficient of variation

phenotypic and genetic correlations
phenotypic and genetic correlations among  <dig> individual fatty acids were presented in fig.  <dig>  the estimated phenotype correlation of these fatty acids  generally displayed different patterns compared to genetic counterparts . we observed that high positive phenotypic and genetic correlations existed between several pairs of individual fatty acids. for instance, the estimated genetic correlations between c20: <dig> and c20: <dig> cis- <dig>  c20: <dig> and c18:2 t-12c- <dig>  c20: <dig> and c20: <dig> n- <dig> and c20: <dig> and c20: <dig> n- <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in contrast, we found clear negative correlations between c14: <dig> and c18: <dig> n- <dig>  c14: <dig> and c20: <dig> n- <dig>  c18: <dig> cis- <dig> and c18: <dig> n- <dig>  c18: <dig> cis- <dig> and c20: <dig> n- <dig> .fig.  <dig> heatmap of phenotypic  and genetic correlation  across  <dig> individual fatty acid compositions




bayesian based gwas and candidate regions
we performed gwas using the bayesb method for  <dig> individual fatty acids that showed estimated genomic heritability ≥  <dig> , including  <dig> saturated fatty acids ,  <dig> monounsaturated fatty acids  and  <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids . to identify potential regions associated with fatty acids, we divided the genome into 100 kb windows, leading to  <dig>  regions across the genome. regions that explain more than 1% of additive genetic variances were considered as candidates and subject to further analyses to identify the associated genes within these regions. summary statistics including genetic variances explained, position for the 100 kb windows, flanking rs number id for these regions, and candidate genes of saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids were represented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.table  <dig> genomic regions associated with the saturated fatty acids in chinese simmental cattle using bayesb method

saturated fatty acids
we detected a total of  <dig> candidate regions that explain more than 1% of genetic variance for saturated fatty acids. these regions were distributed on bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> . among them, we found four, three and nine candidate regions for c14: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c20: <dig>  respectively . intriguingly, the detected window with the largest genetic variance  near  <dig>  mb on bta <dig> for c14: <dig>  containing gene fatty acid synthase  that is related to fatty acid synthesis. we also found one region explaining about  <dig> % of genetic variance for c14: <dig> and located at  <dig>  mb on bta <dig>  this region overlapped with the elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein  <dig>  whose function involves in fatty acid elongase activity . in addition, we identified  <dig> candidate genes that are likely to be related to fatty acids composition embedded in these candidate regions .fig.  <dig>

monounsaturated fatty acids
for monounsaturated fatty acids, we detected  <dig> candidate regions, each of which captured more than 1% of the total genetic variance across six chromosomes . notably, we detected the same region at  <dig>  mb on bta <dig> overlapping with fasn, which explains  <dig> % of the genetic variance for c14: <dig> cis- <dig> , and this region was also associated with c14: <dig>  the top associated region was detected near  <dig>  mb on bta <dig>  which explains  <dig> % of genetic variance for c18: <dig> cis- <dig> , while no known gene was observed near this region. overall, there are three, two and three regions identified to be associated with c14: <dig> cis- <dig>  c16: <dig> cis- <dig> and c18: <dig> cis- <dig>  respectively .fig.  <dig>

polyunsaturated fatty acids
we detected  <dig> associated regions for five polyunsaturated fatty acids, including c18: <dig> n- <dig>  c18: <dig> n- <dig>  c20: <dig> n- <dig>  c20: <dig> n- <dig> and c22: <dig> n- <dig> . of these regions, we observed one candidate region for c18: <dig> n- <dig> that was located at bta <dig>  two regions associated with c18: <dig> n- <dig> at bta <dig> and bta <dig>  two regions associated with c20: <dig> n- <dig> at bta <dig> and bta <dig>  three regions associated with c20: <dig> n- <dig> at bta <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and three regions associated with c22: <dig> n- <dig> at bta <dig>   <dig>   <dig> respectively . notably, we found  <dig> genes imbedded in the identified regions and these genes were likely involved in the function of fatty acid synthesis and metabolism. of these  <dig> genes, two genes were associated with c18: <dig> n- <dig>  three genes with c20: <dig> n- <dig>  six genes with c20: <dig> n- <dig>  and one gene with c22: <dig> n- <dig>  respectively. the top four regions explaining more than 2% of the genetic variance were identified at bta <dig> associated with c18: <dig> n- <dig> , bta <dig> with c18: <dig> n- <dig> , bta <dig> with c22: <dig> n- <dig>  and bta <dig> with c18: <dig> n- <dig> .

fatty acid groups
to systematically explore the genetic mechanism underlying fatty acid composition beyond individual fatty acid, we also conducted gwas using bayesb method on eight fatty acid groups, including sfa, mufa, pufa, pufa/sfa, n- <dig>  n- <dig>  n-6/n- <dig>  and hi . we found three associated regions for hi located at bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig>  two regions for mufa at bta <dig> and bta <dig>  one for n- <dig> at bta <dig> and one for n-6/n- <dig> at bta <dig> . intriguingly, we observed two regions accounting for ~10% of the genetic variance for mufa, while two regions located at bta <dig> and bta <dig> accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of genetic variance for n- <dig> and n-6/n- <dig>  respectively. one region located at bta <dig> overlapped with two genes claudin  <dig>  and daz interacting zinc finger protein  <dig> . for health index , the genetic variances contributed by three identified regions were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, which located at bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig>  respectively. these regions overlapped with sarcoglycan epsilon , paternally expressed  <dig>  and dead-box helicase  <dig> .table  <dig> genomic regions associated with the fatty acid groups in chinese simmental cattle using bayesb method

identification of associated loci using grammar-gc
we further conducted gwas using grammar-gc implemented in genabel package for  <dig> individual fatty acids and eight fatty acid groups, each of which has a genomic heritability of high than  <dig> . to ensure the power and accuracy of gwas for these traits, we utilized genomic control approach to correct for possible population stratifications in grammar-gc test. after this correction, we found the inflation factor λ was close to one, suggesting that our approach has successfully accounted for population stratification, and thus no further adjustment was required. we identified a total of  <dig> and  <dig> significant snps associated with nine fatty acid composition and two fatty acid groups, respectively. the suggestive p value  was used as the cut off threshold for significance, which approximately considered the number of “independent” snps by counting  <dig> snp per ld block, plus all snps outside of blocks . we observed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant associated snps surpassing the suggestive threshold  for c14: <dig>  c14: <dig> cis- <dig>  c18: <dig> cis- <dig>  c18: <dig> n- <dig>  c20: <dig>  c20: <dig> cis- <dig>  c20: <dig> n- <dig>  c20: <dig> n- <dig> and c18:2 t-9c- <dig>  respectively. the top four significant snps for c14: <dig>  were located at  <dig>  mb on bta <dig>  totally, we identified  <dig> associated snps for saturated fatty acid ,  <dig> snps for monounsaturated fatty acids ,  <dig> snps for polyunsaturated fatty acids . notably, we found the majority of snps were located at bta <dig>  and bta <dig> , which indicated these regions are potential candidate for fatty acid composition. fig.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show the genome-wide plots of c14: <dig>  c14: <dig> cis- <dig> and c18: <dig> cis- <dig> for p-values and the absolute values of marker effects against the genomic position. we found one associated snp located at  <dig>  mb on bta <dig> for both c14: <dig> and c14: <dig> cis- <dig> , and this snp was also located at ~4 kb upstream of the fasn gene.

region-based association test and ld analyses
to explore potential associated loci which might fail to be identified due to the strict threshold for high density snps, we investigated two 100 kb associated regions on bta <dig> and bta <dig>  using region-based association tests implemented in r package fregat. the two regions contain two candidate genes fasn and evol <dig> involved in fatty acid synthesis. for the region at  <dig>  mb on bta <dig>  we found  <dig> snps showing significant association with c14: <dig> , and among them, five snps were identified within fasn, and one snp near fasn with the strongest association signal . we found that the p value for region-based test for fasn was  <dig> , which indicated that fasn may be considered as a candidate gene for c14: <dig>  moreover, the ld and haploblock analyses revealed that this region showed high ld level with multiple haploblocks, which may imply a potential selection signature involved in fatty acids within this region in chinese simmental cattle population . for region at  <dig>  mb on bta <dig>  two snps were detected with p <  <dig> , and the top snp  was detected at  <dig>  mb showing significant association . this region partly overlapped with gene elvol <dig>  therefore, we next examined the 500 kb upstream and downstream of the region. however, no other snps were found which were significantly associated with c14: <dig> .fig.  <dig> regional plots of the two major candidate regions on bta <dig> and bta <dig>  results were shown for c14: <dig> at  <dig> - <dig>  mb on bta <dig>  and for c20: <dig> around  <dig> - <dig>  mb on bta <dig> . in the upper panels, the top snps were highlighted by blue solid circles. different levels of linkage disequilibrium  between the lead snp and surrounding snps were indicated in different colors




genomic prediction for fatty acid composition
we performed genomic selection for fatty acid composition using gblup and bayesb. the predictive accuracies ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   using gblup, and from  <dig>   to  <dig>   using bayesb. the averaged predictive accuracies across all fatty acids using gblup and bayesb were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these results suggested that genomic prediction using bayesb was slightly superior over gblup for fatty acids in chinese simmental cattle.

for each individual fatty acid trait, we found that the relatively high predictive accuracies were achieved for c14: <dig>  c22: <dig>  c14: <dig> cis- <dig>  c18: <dig> n- <dig>  c20: <dig> n- <dig> for both gblup and bayesb. despite the fact that bayesb performed at least as well as gblup for most traits, we indeed found some traits where bayesb showed much higher predictive accuracies than gblup, such as c14: <dig> , c18: <dig> , c24: <dig> , c18:2 t-12c- <dig> , c18: <dig> n- <dig> , c20: <dig> n- <dig>  . to investigate possible bias between the predicated and observed breeding values, we also calculated the regression coefficient of genomic estimated breeding values on adjusted phenotypes . our results revealed that the average regression coefficients for gblup and bayesb were  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating that bayesb is less biased than gblup because the latter has a regression coefficient closer to unity.table  <dig> predictive accuracy  and regression coefficients  of genomic breeding value prediction for fatty acid composition




discussion
fatty acid is an important indicator of meat quality and taste, and its strongly influences consumer’s preferences  <cit> . previous genome-wide association studies have been conducted for fatty acid composition in multiple cattle breeds, including angus, japanese black, nellore and other crossbreds  <cit> . to our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate molecular mechanism underling fatty acid composition using high density snp array and evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions in chinese simmental cattle population.

genomic wide scan identified candidate regions and loci
we investigated  <dig> individual fatty acids including  <dig> saturated fatty acids,  <dig> monounsaturated fatty acids,  <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids and  <dig> fatty acid groups. despite the fact that single-snp based gwas methods have been widely used in many studies, these methods may not be powerful for studying the complex traits with low or moderate heritability. due to the polygenic characteristics of fatty acid composition in cattle, gwas using the bayesian methods have enabled to identify many associated loci that have missed by the single-snp regression approach  <cit> . bayesb has been widely used for gwas of complex trait in farm animals . in this study, we utilized bayesb and grammar-gc to identify candidate regions associated with fatty acids in chinese simmental cattle population. we detected a total of  <dig> candidate regions on  <dig> autosomes associated with fatty acid composition using bayesb. however, these identified regions may not include all potentially significant associated snps due to use of 100 kb window-based strategy in bayesb. therefore, we conducted gwas using the single locus grammar-gc method implemented in genable package. with this approach, we detected a total of  <dig> and  <dig> significant associated snps for individual fatty acids and fatty acid groups using a suggestive adjust threshold. the suggested threshold was set to avoid overestimation of the significant snps caused by high ld level in the high density snps array  <cit> . in current study, we found a total of  <dig> candidate snps overlapping with these regions identified by bayesb. for instance, the same candidate peaks for c14: <dig>  c14: <dig> cis- <dig> and c18: <dig> cis- <dig> were identified using both methods . utilization of multiple complementary methods is an effective way to detect candidate regions or snps and helps elucidate genetic architecture of complex traits in farm animals  <cit> .

candidate genes for fatty acid composition
several genes were identified as potential candidates contributing to the genetic architecture of fatty acids in this study. among them, we observed fasn at 51 mb on bta <dig> overlapped with a 100 kb associated region, which explains 10% and  <dig> % of the genetic variances for c14: <dig> and c14: <dig> cis- <dig>  respectively. notably, we also found multiple significant snps around this gene that were associated with c14: <dig> using the grammar-gc method. a region-based association test revealed strong evidence of association for multiple snps within this gene. furthermore, we found strong ld at the upstream of fasn . this gene encodes a multifunctional protein enzyme to catalyze the synthesis of palmitate  from acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa, in the presence of nadph. previous studies based on candidate gene approaches had revealed polymorphisms within fasn that were related to fatty acid composition in multiple beef cattle populations  and milk fat content in dairy cattle  <cit> . for instance, several studies were conducted to explore and evaluate the association between fatty acid composition and candidate snps using gwas in japanese beef cattle  <cit> . these studies provided multiple evidences that several snps near or within fasn may be regarded as responsible mutations for fatty acid composition and contribute largely to meat quality in the japanese black cattle population. saatchi et al performed gwas using bovinesnp <dig> in angus beef cattle and reported fasn located at 51 mb on bta <dig>  was associated with fatty acids  <cit> . chen et al. found snp rs <dig>  located near fasn. this snp rs <dig> had relative large effects on multiple fatty acids in both subcutaneous adipose and longissimus lumborum muscle tissues of crossbred beef cattle  <cit> . however, investigation of genetic architecture of fatty acids in the nellore cattle showed no significant associations for several polymorphisms within or near fasn  <cit> . despite previous studies have indicated that fasn has a conserved role across genetic backgrounds, there are several different variants that may be responsible for the different fasn effects in different breeds, and different fasn alleles appear to be segregating in different populations  <cit> .

another gene called elovl <dig> encodes a multi-pass membrane protein which is involved in the elongation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. this gene was identified in the associated region at  <dig>  mb on bta <dig> accounting for  <dig> % of the genetic variance for c14: <dig> cis- <dig>  elovl <dig> plays an important role in de novo synthesis of specific mufa species in mammalian cells, elovl <dig> knockdown decreased the elongation of c16: <dig> cis- <dig>  n- <dig>  and elovl <dig> overexpression increased synthesis of c18: <dig> cis- <dig>  n- <dig>  <cit> . also, previous study using mice models revealed that a reduced elovl <dig> activity can lead to hepatic steatosis, and endogenously synthesized pufas are critical regulators of fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . lemos et al. reported a candidate region embedded in elovl <dig> can explain 4% of the genetic variance for c20: <dig> n- <dig> using ssgblup based on window association test in nellore cattle  <cit> . the consistent role of elovl <dig> gene involved in fatty acid synthesis and composition was also extensively investigated in diverse pig populations .

moreover, previous studies suggested that elovl <dig> are involved in the production of multiple acids including c16: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> in cattle  <cit> . also, elovl <dig> was found associated with c20:1n9/c18:1n <dig> and c20:2n6/c18:2n <dig> in a f <dig> population derived from erhulian pig  <cit> . as a result, elovl <dig> may have pleiotropic effects on multiple fatty acid composition and also appear to exhibit pleiotropic effects in multiple metabolic steps. however, we only identified elovl <dig> that was associated with c14: <dig> in chinese simmental cattle. in addition, several previous studies have suggested variants within scd gene and the expression level of scd gene should be significantly associated with fatty acids  <cit> , the scd gene was not detected in this study, probably due to heterogeneous genetic architecture of fatty acids differ across different populations.

genomic prediction for fatty acid composition
previous studies have investigated predictive abilities of genomic selection for fatty acid composition in american angus  <cit> , japanese black cattle  <cit>  and canadian beef cattle  <cit> . in the current study, we explored, for the first time, genomic prediction for fatty acid composition in chinese simmental cattle. we found that the accuracies of genomic prediction for most of fatty acids were relatively low  using both gblup and bayesb, which was consistent with a previous report by chen et al.  <cit> . this finding may be explained by the relatively low and inaccurate estimates of heritability for the measured fatty acid composition  <cit> . our studies also revealed that bayesb provided slightly higher average regression coefficients as compared to gblup. considering the complex architecture of fatty acid composition, this finding implied that bayesb which allows a fraction of snps to be allocated with relatively large effects is superior over gblup which assumes the same genetic variance for each snp. fatty acid composition are commonly recognized as complex traits with a polygenic nature and, to some extent, they are difficult to measure, thus the application of genomic selection for fatty acids will be valuable in future selection breeding programs. with increasing public understanding of the relationships between diet and health, much attention should be paid to the studies of some important fatty acids related to human health  <cit> . as consumer become more health conscious, they have increased preference for better tasting and healthier products in their diet such as unsaturated fatty acid levels. further investigation of causal mutations will promote our understanding of lipid metabolism, fat deposition and application of selection for fatty acids in cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified several significant associated regions and loci as the potential candidate markers for genomics-assisted breeding programs. using multiple methods, our results revealed that fasn and elovl <dig> associated with fatty acids with strong evidences. our analyses also suggested that it is feasible to perform genomic selection for fatty acids in the chinese simmental cattle population.
