BACKGROUND
the calcium-dependent protein kinase  and target-of-rapamycin  signaling pathways are conserved in yeast and other fungi and are important for stress response and fungal survival. in addition to regulating growth and metabolic activity in normal cells, these pathways also regulate the cellular response to transient cell wall stress during the normal yeast life cycle, and during exposure to heat shock, cell wall damage, or other stressors that can compromise cellular integrity  <cit> . our studies with myosin type ii-deficient  strains of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, which we have characterized previously as stress mutants, showed that the pkc1p pathway is activated and essential for myo1Δ strain survival  <cit> . it has been our contention that this activation is due to cell wall stress caused by morphological abnormalities in the lateral cell wall and bud neck architecture  <cit> . in response to cell wall damage, heat shock, and other types of environmental stress, rho1p activates the pkc <dig> cell wall integrity pathway , which in turn activates slt2p , the serine/threonine  mapk at the end of this cascade  <cit> . this leads to transcriptional up regulation of cell wall-related genes by the rlm1p transcription factor  <cit> . in addition to regulating the genetic program for cell wall integrity through the transcription factor rlm1p  <cit> , slt2p may also modulate pkc <dig> activity indirectly by a previously proposed feedback mechanism that phosphorylates and down regulates the rho1p gdp-gtp exchange factor  rom2p  <cit> . rho1p also functions as the regulatory subunit of fks1p, a β- <dig> -glucan synthase for lateral cell wall fortification  <cit> .

in prior studies, we have shown that similar to wild-type  cells under stress conditions, the myo1Δ mutant  also activates the pkc <dig> cwip, but uses a different repertoire of genes  <cit> . further characterization of the genes of the myo1Δ mutant at the post-transcriptional level showed that only a subset of cell wall integrity genes was activated. thus, the myo1Δ mutant may serve as a simplified model for studying the cell wall stress response. furthermore, we found that translation and ribosome biogenesis were down regulated in the myo1Δ strain  <cit> . this observation led us to investigate the role of tor in the myo1Δ strain survival and how it may complement the reduced cwip response.

yeast tor consists of two proteins - tor1p and tor2p - which are contained in two protein complexes torc <dig> and torc <dig>  <cit> . the torc <dig> complex that is sensitive to rapamycin treatment contains proteins tor1p or tor2p, kog1p, tco89p and lst8p  <cit> . torc <dig> that is resistant to rapamycin treatment contains tor2p, avo1p, avo2p, avo3p, bit61p, and lst8p  <cit> . recent subcellular localization studies showed that tor1p was concentrated near to the vacuolar membrane while tor2p was predominantly in punctuate structures near to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane  <cit> . their differences in composition, sensitivity to rapamycin, and cellular localization support the idea that they function as two separate complexes  <cit> . tor is important for nutrient sensing and is believed to play an important role in life span extension  <cit> . while tor is conserved structurally and functionally from yeast to human, their roles are not biologically identical and warrant careful characterization of tor from both species.

rho1p is regulated by two mechanisms, a tor-independent mechanism that is activated by cell wall stress  and a separate torc2-dependent mechanism that regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization through the rho1p-dependent activation of pkc <dig>  <cit> . in this latter pathway, rom2p activity is indirectly modulated by the essential phosphatidylinositol kinase torc <dig> via a gtpase switch consisting of rho1p, rho2p, rom2p, and sac7p   <cit> . in short, the torc2-dependent association of rho1p  with the rom2p phosphatidylinositol-binding domain promotes rom2p activation and downstream events  <cit> . in this manner rom2p functions as the relay by which torc <dig> regulates polarization of the actin cytoskeleton via pkc1p. therefore, functional interconnections between pkc1p and torc <dig> have been proposed through a mechanism integrated by the rho1p-rom2p complex  <cit>  .

the stress sensor proteins wsc1p, wsc2p, wsc3p, mid2p and mtl1p are involved in the activation of cell integrity signaling  <cit> . these cell surface sensors span the plasma membrane and are attached to the extracellular cell wall. the mid2p homologue mtl1p, that shares 50% sequence identity with mid2p, appears to have a minor role in pkc <dig> signaling  <cit> . these sensors react differently under specific stress conditions  <cit> . it has been reported that cells lacking wsc <dig> are hypersensitive to drugs interfering with the cell wall and plasma membrane like calcofluor white, congo red, caspofungin, chlorpromazine and tea tree oil  <cit> . additionally, wsc1p responds to hypo-osmotic and alkaline ph conditions  <cit> . a mid2Δ mutant is hypersensitive to pheromone treatment, is hyperresistant to calcofluor white, tea tree oil and congo red, and it senses acidic conditions and vanadate  <cit> . wsc1p and mid2p are also involved in the response to heat shock  <cit> . wsc <dig> and wsc <dig> act as suppressors of mutants defective in glycerol synthesis  <cit> , while mtl1p is associated with response to oxidative stress and glucose starvation  <cit> . the wsc family of proteins and mid2p have been shown to interact with specific signaling proteins that transmit stress signals from the fungal cell wall sensors to the pkc1p and tor signaling pathways. for example, rom2p, the gef that regulates pkc1p, physically interacts with wsc1p, wsc2p, and mid2p to activate the pkc <dig> cwip in the response to cell wall stress  <cit> . to define the nature of these signaling interactions in myo1Δ strains, we demonstrate here that torc <dig> and pkc1p activities were inversely correlated, which suggests cross-talk between the two pathways. furthermore, we found that torc <dig> was down regulated in myo1Δ strains by a mechanism that required expression of wsc1p but not the other cell wall stress sensors. surprisingly, tor2p functions were not essential for survival in myo1Δ cells.

RESULTS
torc <dig> activity is down regulated in myo1Δ strains
to test the hypothesis that the torc <dig> pathway was down regulated in the myo1Δ strain, we measured the levels of phosphorylated or dephosphorylated npr1p to assess the torc <dig> status  <cit> . torc <dig> signaling regulates phosphorylation of the ser/thr protein kinase npr1p at  <dig> potential phosphorylation sites  <cit> . at steady state, npr1p is maintained inactive by phosphorylation  <cit>  . inhibition of torc <dig> activity by nutrient starvation or application of the antiproliferative drug rapamycin results in dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of npr1p by the protein phosphatase sit4p  <cit>  . to detect npr1p in the myo1Δ strains, an expression plasmid containing a functional n-terminal hemagglutinin -tagged npr <dig> gene  was transformed into wt and mutant strains  <cit> .

the phosphorylation state of npr1p can be deduced from its relative electrophoretic mobility on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and detected by western blot analysis using an anti-ha antibody. in wt whole cell extracts, npr1p was detected as a slower-migrating band, which corresponds to the hyperphosphorylated form, npr1pp . treatment of wt whole cell extracts with exogenous calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase  converted the slower-migrating band to a faster-migrating band which corresponds to the in vitro dephosphorylated form, npr1p . treatment of wt cell cultures with rapamycin produced a faster-migrating npr1p band that co-migrated with the ppase treated band, consistent with the inhibition of torc <dig> activity by rapamycin . this experiment established that the activity of torc <dig> could be assessed indirectly by observing the relative electrophoretic mobility of npr1p by sds-page  <cit> .

in myo1Δ whole cell extracts, no change in the electrophoretic mobility of npr1p was observed as judged by the co-migration of npr1p bands in extracts from rapamycin treated and untreated cells . this result suggested that npr1p is dephosphorylated at steady state in the myo1Δ strain. a chs2Δ strain  and an fks1Δ strain  were incorporated as controls representing strains under cell wall stress  <cit> . in contrast, the electrophoretic mobility of npr1p in chs2Δ  and fks1Δ  control strains behaved similar to the wt . phosphatase treatment did not change the electrophoretic mobility of npr1p in the myo1Δ extracts supporting our hypothesis that torc <dig> is down regulated . introduction of a tor1Δ mutation into the myo1Δ strain did not produce any change in the electrophoretic migration of npr1p compared to the myo1Δ single mutant . this was also consistent with the notion that torc <dig> is inhibited in the myo1Δ strain. these observations suggest that the myo1Δ strain is distinct from the other cell wall stress models because despite the similarity between these strains which have the pkc <dig> cwip activated, the torc <dig> activity was inhibited in the myo1Δ strain but not in the cell wall mutants tested  .

the sit <dig> gene encodes a protein phosphatase that is responsible for dephosphorylation of npr1p in vivo during nutrient starvation   <cit> . torc <dig> when active, phosphorylates tap42p, which then binds and keeps sit4p inactive  <cit> . thus, sit4p activity is negatively regulated by torc <dig>  <cit> . in previous studies, npr1p was shown to maintain the hyperphosphorylated state in a sit4Δ mutant treated with rapamycin indicating that its dephosphorylation was directly dependent on sit4p activity  <cit> . to establish that dephosphorylation of npr1p employs the same mechanism in myo1Δ, we conducted a western blot analysis of npr1p in a myo1Δsit4Δ strain . absence of sit4p activity in the myo1Δ strain resulted in the accumulation of the slow-migrating hyperphosphorylated npr1p. this result supports that the myo1Δ dephosphorylation of npr1p is via sit4p.

tor signaling activity was previously reported to negatively regulate the pkc <dig> cwip  <cit>  because rapamycin treatment resulted in up regulation of pkc <dig> activity. our new observations show that torc <dig> was repressed in myo1Δ cells while we had previously shown that pkc <dig> activity was up regulated in these strains  <cit> . to determine if the repression of torc <dig> activity in myo1Δ cells is responsible for up regulation of the pkc <dig> pathway, we treated myo1Δ cells with rapamycin and monitored slt2p/mpk1p hyperphosphorylation  by western blot analysis . as previously reported, down regulation of torc <dig> activity in wt cells treated with rapamycin resulted in up regulation of pkc <dig>  reflected by an accumulation of p-slt2p . in untreated myo1Δ cells, there was an accumulation of p-slt2p as described previously . there was no significant increase in p-slt2p levels following rapamycin treatment in these cells . this observation supports the aforementioned result  <cit>  that down regulation of torc <dig> activity is correlated to the up regulation of pkc <dig> 

to analyze this putative cross-talk further, we assayed the relative levels of p-slt2p in a myo1Δtor1Δ strain. in the absence of tor1p, a myo1Δtor1Δ strain maintained significant steady state levels of p-slt2p at approximately 50% of the myo1Δ- levels , while treatment with rapamycin did not generate a significant change in these levels . a tor1Δ single mutant activated pkc <dig> at low levels .

to determine if these strains presented a growth defect we tested wt, myo1Δ, tor1Δ and myo1Δtor1Δ strains for cell viability using a serial dilution assay . the myo1Δ strain exhibited a viability range similar to the wt strain. surprisingly, the tor1Δ strain showed increased viability through the  <dig> cells/ml range, consistent with previous studies that showed that tor1p functions were not essential for cell viability. despite having p-slt2p present  the myo1Δtor1Δ strain presented a reduction in cell viability of approximately four orders of magnitude . therefore, down regulation of torc <dig> appears to be favorable to maintain viability in the myo1Δ strain while a complete absence of tor1p in this strain is detrimental. these results imply that tor1p may have a predominant role in the torc <dig> functions with less activity attributed to the tor2p in this complex. however, the residual activity in the torc <dig> complex was essential for myo1Δtor1Δ strain survival because five days treatment with the ic <dig> of rapamycin  resulted in a 10-fold further reduction of growth .

positive genetic interaction between myo <dig> and tor2: lethality of a tor2-21ts allele at 37°c is rescued by myo1Δ
torc <dig> is not essential in wt  <cit>  or myo1Δ strains. in contrast, torc <dig> carries out essential functions in yeast cells that are not shared with torc <dig>  <cit> . growth at the permissive  and restrictive  temperatures was assayed for strains wt, myo1Δ, chs2Δ , sh <dig>  and combination strains bearing also the ptor2ts plasmid. since torc <dig> is responsible for essential cellular functions, the expected outcome was that repression of the tor2-21ts allele at 37°c would be lethal in any strain. parental strains and mutant strains bearing ptor2ts were therefore assessed for growth on agar at 26°c and 37°c. as expected, the wt, myo1Δ, and chs2Δ strains did not exhibit temperature sensitive growth . the tor2Δ ptor2ts , wt ptor2ts, and chs2Δ ptor2ts strains were viable at 26°c and temperature sensitive for growth at 37°c indicating dominance of the tor2-21ts mutation . in contrast, the myo1Δ ptor2ts strain presented viable growth at both temperatures . the suppression of tor2-21ts lethality by myo1Δ in this strain  was also confirmed in the sh <dig> strain background  to exclude genetic background effects. growth was also assessed on leucine dropout medium plates to ascertain that strains transformed with the ptor2ts allele were expressing the plasmid, as observed by the normal growth at 26°c , and again that the tor2-21ts defect was suppressed in the absence of the myo <dig> gene at 37°c independently of the strain background . the positive genetic interaction between myo1Δ and tor2-21ts mutations was reverted by complementation with a plasmid-borne copy of the wild type myo <dig> gene in myo1Δtor2Δptor2tspmyo <dig>   and also myo1Δptor2tspmyo <dig>  strains .

torc <dig> has been shown to have a strong regulatory effect on pkc <dig> activity in cell wall mutants  <cit> . to explain the observed synthetic rescue of tor2-21ts lethality by myo1Δ, we conducted a western blot analysis of p-slt2p levels in the wt, myo1Δ , tor2Δ ptor2ts and myo1Δ ptor2ts strains  at the permissive temperature. wt and tor2Δ ptor2ts strains showed similarly low p-slt2p levels consistent with growth under non-stress conditions . the myo1Δ  and myo1Δ ptor2ts  strains both presented a higher level of p-slt2p relative to wt strains at 26°c, which was also consistent with previous observations that pkc <dig> is activated in these strains .

to assess if rescue of tor2-21ts lethality at the restrictive temperature by myo1Δ was accompanied by a change in pkc <dig> activity levels, p-slt2p was analyzed in whole cell extracts from cultures taken at 37°c . the temperature shift to 37°c produced an increase in p-slt2p levels in all four strains attributable to the heat shock effect that is known to activate the pkc <dig> pathway  <cit> . this suggests that there may exist two pools of slt2p, one that is activated by the myo1Δ mutation and one that is activated  by the heat stress. densitometric quantification and normalization of autoradiographs from duplicate experiments established that p-slt2p levels in the myo1Δ ptor2ts strain at 37°c were 5-fold higher than in the tor2Δ ptor2ts strain yet were very similar to the myo1Δ single mutant strain at 37°c . however, when we compared p-slt2p levels between the tor2Δ ptor2ts and myo1Δtor2Δptor2ts strain, there was no significant difference between them supporting that the rescue effect was not due to tor2p-dependent p-slt2p up regulation  or differences in p-slt2p levels.

evidence for a cross-talk between pkc1p, torc <dig>  and cell wall stress sensor wsc1p
inhibition of tor functions activates multiple cell wall stress sensor proteins located in the plasma membrane that interact with signaling intermediates through their c-terminus in the cytoplasm  <cit> . cell wall stress sensor proteins that belong to the wsc family and also include the mid <dig> proteins, signal positively to activate the pkc <dig> cwip  <cit> . under cell wall stress conditions, wsc1p, wsc2p and mid2p are reported to be the principal sensors responsible for activating this pathway  <cit> . consistent with the notion that cell wall stress sensors may mediate the stress response in myo1Δ strains, we have presented evidence that the pkc <dig> cwip is activated and essential  <cit>  and that torc <dig> activity is down regulated in myo1Δ strains . to test if cell wall stress sensor proteins could, by a cross-talk mechanism, be involved in down regulating the tor pathway, the myo1Δ mutation was inserted in wsc1Δ, wsc2Δ, wsc3Δ and mid2Δ mutant strains by standard genetic techniques . the single mutants  and their corresponding double mutant strains  were tested for torc <dig> activity and cell viability .

relative torc <dig> activity levels for the wt and myo1Δ strains were previously shown , while the results for myo1Δwsc2Δ, myo1Δwsc3Δ and myo1Δmid2Δ strains were also consistent with down regulated torc <dig> activity in these strains . in contrast, the myo1Δwsc1Δ double mutant strain exhibited a result that was consistent with a fully active torc <dig>  as judged by the relative decrease in electrophoretic mobility normally exhibited by npr1pp, and the restored sensitivity of npr1pp electrophoretic mobility to rapamycin treatment . also, like the myo1Δ and wsc1Δ strains , preliminary results show that wsc2Δ, wsc3Δ, and mid2Δ single mutant strains  exhibited a rapamycin-insensitive npr1p electrophoretic mobility that was consistent with down regulation of torc <dig>  these results indicate that absence of these cell wall stress sensors represents a cell stress and supports the idea that they also play a role during normal cell growth. we therefore conclude from these results that wsc1p may be associated with the regulation of torc <dig> in both the wt and myo1Δ strains.

because torc <dig> and pkc <dig> activities maintain an inverse relationship  <cit> , we predicted that a re-activation of the torc <dig> observed in the myo1Δwsc1Δ strain would exert an inhibitory effect on the pkc <dig> pathway. consistent with this hypothesis, the myo1Δwsc1Δ strain failed to activate the pkc <dig> pathway as evidenced by undetectable levels of p-slt2p relative to a myo1Δ single mutant where pkc <dig> was activated . cell viability analysis revealed a reduction in growth of approximately one order of magnitude in the myo1Δwsc1Δ double mutant strain relative to the myo1Δ strain and two orders of magnitude relative to wt and wsc1Δ strains that grew comparably well .

we then tested eif2α phosphorylation levels as an additional readout of torc <dig> status  <cit> . previous studies showed that torc <dig> down regulation in myo1Δ was evidenced by a large  accumulation of phosphorylated eif2α  produced by a tor-dependent activation of gcn2p protein kinase   <cit> . the myo1Δwsc1Δ mutant combination that restored wild type electrophoretic mobility to npr1p  also restored eif2α-p to its active unphosphorylated state, eif2α , thereby confirming that torc <dig> was being reactivated in this mutant. likewise, the accumulation of eif2α-p in the wsc1Δ mutant confirmed that torc <dig> activity was down regulated in this mutant . control extracts from the wt and myo1Δ strains were consistent with previously reported results  <cit> . total eif2α confirmed that the proposed changes in eif2α-p were due to phosphorylation rather than a change in steady state levels of eif2α .

discussion
yeast cells must respond rapidly and effectively to alterations in the environment in order to survive stressful conditions. these processes require the involvement of signal transduction pathways such as tor and pkc <dig>  the pkc <dig> dependent cwip is the first line of response to cell wall damage in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . transduction of the signal begins with the cell wall stress sensor proteins wsc1p and mid2p at the plasma membrane and proceeds through rom2p and rho1p to the pkc <dig> cwip that ends with activation of the map kinase, slt2p  <cit>  . downstream, the transcription factor rlm1p activates nuclear genes involved in cell wall synthesis and remodeling to produce a cell wall stress response that increases the survival potential of the yeast cell  <cit> . we have shown in prior studies that the pkc <dig> pathway is continuously activated in myo1Δ strains  <cit> . this response is further characterized here in the myo1Δ strains. in addition to the up regulation of the cwip we found that torc <dig> was down regulated to enhance cell survival and we provide evidence of cross-talk between the two signaling pathways.

npr1p is a protein kinase that regulates the amino acid permease gap1p to transport secondary nitrogen sources into the cell for the restoration of amino acid precursor levels and protein synthesis  <cit> . when torc <dig> is down regulated by nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment, npr1p becomes dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase sit4p, thereby activating its biochemical function  <cit>  furthermore, inactivation of torc <dig> results in downregulation of ribosome and protein synthesis  <cit> . when we assayed the relative status of torc <dig> activity in a myo1Δ strain, we observed that npr1p was maintained in the dephosphorylated state and demonstrated that the npr1p phosphorylation state was directly dependent on torc <dig> and sit4p activities. therefore, we established that the torc <dig> complex is found in a predominantly inactive state in the myo1Δ strain. the implications of such a metabolic state led us to believe that the survival of this strain is directly linked to this observation. however, the complete absence of tor1p by genetic deletion  was detrimental for survival of the myo1Δstrain, supporting that a precise level of torc <dig> activity must be maintained for its survival. furthermore, complete inhibition of torc <dig> activity by rapamycin treatment of a myo1Δtor1Δ strain was lethal for growth, further supporting the idea that minimal levels of torc <dig> activity are essential. conversely, the tor1Δ single mutant was shown to acquire increased fitness, which was consistent with the proposed role of mtor and tor in regulating longevity and replicative life span extension respectively  <cit> .

it was previously known that the torc <dig> pathway plays a role in the response to cell wall stress by a negative regulation of the pkc <dig> cwip under nutrient rich conditions  <cit>  . under myo1Δ conditions, we observed a clear inverse biochemical correlation between torc <dig> and pkc1p activities. this raised the question, is there a common upstream regulator of the two pathways? our results are strongly suggestive that wsc1p acts as a common upstream regulator of torc <dig> and pkc <dig> by exerting a positive role in the activation of the pkc <dig> cwip and a negative role in the down regulation of torc <dig> by an unknown mechanism. we do not propose that torc <dig> and wsc1p interact directly. most likely, the mechanism involves an undetermined protein interactor of wsc1p . recently, we have identified several novel wsc1p interacting proteins  and suspect that some may function as a signaling intermediate between wsc1p and torc <dig>  however, pending future studies, it is not known whether or not these wsc1p interactors inhibit torc <dig> 

our findings showed that chs2Δ and fks1Δ mutant strains strongly activated the pkc <dig> cwip yet maintained normal torc <dig> activity levels. we are therefore confronted with variable signaling outputs exiting from the cell wall stress sensors. in particular, disruption of cell wall integrity by these mutants leads to activation of the pkc <dig> cwip; however, only the disruption of cytokinesis in a myo1Δ strain leads to both activation of the pkc <dig> cwip and down regulation of torc <dig> . this finding is consistent with the transcriptional profiles we have determined previously, where myo1Δ only regulated half of the cwip fingerprint genes, while fks1Δ and chs2Δ profiles were more like other cell wall damage profiles  <cit> . this reinforces the idea that myo1Δ activates a cell signaling program that is distinct from other cell wall mutants. we propose that in addition to its filament assembly function, the tail domain may serve as a scaffold  for the assembly of interacting protein complexes at the cytokinetic ring that are important for myosin function  <cit> . therefore, disruption of these putative protein assemblies by a genetic deletion of the myo <dig> gene may activate the cell wall stress sensors wsc1p and mid2p in a different manner than in the chs2Δ and fks1Δ mutants. the non-muscle myosin heavy chain  of budding yeast has been shown to have independent functions associated with the head and tail domains of the protein  <cit> . the tail domain contains a minimum localization domain  that is sufficient to target the myosin heavy chain to the bud neck independently of the actin-binding site that is encoded within the head domain  <cit> . therefore, despite the common activation of the pkc <dig> cwip among the myo1Δ, chs2Δ and fks1Δ mutant strains, we hypothesize that the inhibition of torc <dig> by wsc1p is unique to the myo1Δ mutant and may be triggered by the disruption of specific protein-protein interactions in the putative myo1p scaffold at the cytokinetic ring.

the final question that arises from these results is, how does the myo1Δ mutant rescue tor2-21ts lethality? strains that carry the temperature-sensitive gene of tor <dig>  arrest growth at the restrictive temperature . this lethality is thought to be caused by the lack of torc <dig> activity, decreased rho <dig> activation  <cit> , the lack of actin organization and cell lysis probably due to cell wall defects  <cit> . the lethality has been shown to be rescued in several different ways. one way is by growth on nonfermentative carbon sources  but not by nonfermentable carbon sources   <cit> . a second way in which tor2ts lethality can be circumvented is by treatment with agents that cause cell integrity stress   <cit> . a third way in which the tor2ts lethality can be rescued is by the osmotic stabilizer, sorbitol, again suggesting that the cell wall is somehow compromised. finally, there are several genes that have been shown to suppress the lethality of tor2ts lethality. one example is yeast pas kinase overexpression  which is thought to suppress the tor2ts lethality by rho1-dependent activation of pkc <dig> and actin rearrangement, activation of fks <dig> and cell wall synthesis, or both  <cit> . these observations have lead to the idea that cell growth and survival is a product of signals derived from cell integrity and nutrient availability  <cit> . in this work we provide evidence for rescue of tor2ts lethality by the deletion of the myo <dig> gene. we propose that myo1Δ rescues the tor2ts lethality by invoking both strategies described above, namely, by activating a starvation type response  and the cell wall integrity pathway , most likely through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. however, unlike the results of cardon et al.  <cit>  where the essential rho1p gef was rom2p, the roles of rom1p and rom2p appear to be redundant for the proposed myo1Δ rescue mechanism .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that cross-talk between the pkc <dig> and tor signaling cascades occur under the myo1Δ stress condition. torc <dig> activity was found to be inversely correlated with activation of the pkc <dig> pathway while both tor1p and pkc1p act as positive regulators of viability in the myo1Δ strain. synthetic rescue of tor2-21ts lethality by myo1Δ points to the pkc1-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton as the possible rescue mechanism. the data presented supports that in addition to its known role in signaling to the pkc <dig> cwip, wsc1p may also function as an upstream regulator of torc <dig>
