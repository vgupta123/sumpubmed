BACKGROUND
in recent years there has been an explosion in the number of studies measuring gene expression under various different experimental conditions. the outcome of such studies is usually a list of genes which have been seen to vary between the different conditions and therefore may be of interest to study further. increasingly use is made of databases of other information on the genes in order to provide additional inference. one of the most used in the gene ontology  database  <cit> .

the gene ontology is a database of standardised biological terms used to annotate gene products. in total it comprises around  <dig>  terms, divided in three branches: molecular function, biological process and cellular component. each branch can be represented as a directed acyclic graph  relating terms  of different degrees of specificity, with directed links from less specific to more specific terms. each node in the graph can have several parents  and children . see figure  <dig> for an example of a small section of the go graph. annotation of a gene to any given node a implies automatic annotation to all ancestors of a . genes can be annotated with several terms, though many genes have not been annotated at all.

tests for gene set enrichment  <cit>  compare lists of differentially expressed  genes and non-de genes to find which terms in the go are over or under-represented amongst the de genes. several groups have developed software to carry out fisher's exact tests to find go terms which are over-represented amongst the genes found to be differentially expressed in the microarray experiment, e.g.  <cit>  and other work cited in  <cit> . the fisher's test for node i essentially compares the proportion of de genes annotated to node i with the proportion of non-de genes annotated to node i .

since there is a test for each of several  <dig> go nodes, multiple testing must be taken into account. this is generally done by controlling the false discovery rate   <cit> . benjamini and hochberg's method  <cit>  gives valid control of the fdr even when the different tests are positive-regression-dependent.

there remain some problems in the finding and interpretation of over or under-represented go terms. some difficulties which relate to the structure of the gene ontology graph are given here:

i. interpretation of closely related functions
since all genes annotated to a given go node are also annotated to all its parents, closely related nodes may be found separately significant. if the go graph were a tree, this problem could be partly solved by choosing a depth of the tree to focus on, according to the balance of statistical power and specificity of function required. in fact most software packages available do treat the go graph as if it were a tree, with levels defined as the shortest path from the node to the top. however, as the graph is not a tree, one level can contain child-parent pairs. . in the interpretation of the function of the de genes, these should not really be treated separately.

ii. statistical power
how far down the go should we look? the most specific go terms have few genes annotated so there is often not enough power to find these terms statistically significant. the more general the go term, the more genes are annotated to it, but the less useful it is as an indication of the function of the differentially expressed genes.

iii. dependence between tests
there is a great deal of positive dependence between go terms, since many genes are annotated to several go terms. this can be controlled for with an appropriate multiple testing correction, but with high dependence the correction will be very conservative, so some statistically significant terms will be missed.

some work has been done to improve the dependence issue. grossmann et al.  <dig>  <cit>  takes account of the hierarchical structure of the go by measuring the over-representation of each term relative to its parent terms. alexa et al.  <dig>  <cit>  downweights the contribution of genes to the calculation of over-representation of a term if the children of that term have already been found significantly enriched. these methods do not improve the statistical power, as the number of genes in each hypothesis test will be smaller than in the usual term-by-term tests, as double-counting is penalised. however, they do help with interpretation, since they produce just one  significant p-values for each significant region of the graph. we propose a complementary approach; we choose to group closely related go nodes together first, and obtain a p-value for each group. this has the additional benefit that we can find additional significant regions of the go graph, as the power of the tests is improved by grouping terms together. we use a software package called the poset ontology categorizer or posoc  <cit>  which groups go terms together based on gene annotation and pseudo-distance between nodes, whilst respecting the structure of the ontology. we call our method pogo; software is available at .

RESULTS
wildtype versus knock-out mouse data set
our first application is a data set consisting of wildtype and knock-out mice, referred to here as the cd <dig> data set. cd <dig> is a gene known to be involved in insulin-resistance  <cit> . this data set was previously analyzed with a bayesian hierarchical model  <cit>  and the resulting lists of genes input to the fatigo software  <cit>  to find over and under-represented go terms. controlling for the false discovery rate  led to no terms being found statistically significant. 

we now analyze this data using posoc groups. this data set is from the u74a affymetrix chip, so the posoc groups we use are those found using all genes on the u74a chip . there are  <dig> groups. note that the number of nodes in the biological process branch of the gene ontology is around  <dig>  so we have greatly reduced the space on which we perform the statistical tests. table  <dig> shows the frequencies of group sizes. figure  <dig> shows a scatter plot of the number of genes versus number of nodes. the distributions are highly skewed, with most groups being made up of fewer than  <dig> go nodes, and having fewer than  <dig> genes annotated.

numbers of go nodes in posoc groups for the u74a chip .

the adjusted p-values found by testing the posoc groups are given in table  <dig>  pogo finds three groups significantly over-represented amongst de genes after controlling for fdr at 5%: those with cluster heads "response to pest, pathogen or parasite", "response to wounding" and "immune response". the numbers of go nodes in these groups are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the numbers of genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the three groups are marked in figure  <dig>  it can be seen that they are large groups, but not atypical.

the go categories found significant here are of interest. previous research on the functions of cd <dig> has linked the gene product to the regulation of immune responses to pathogens  <cit>  and parasites  <cit> . cd <dig> deficiency in humans has been found to be associated with increased severity of malarial pathology in affected populations  <cit> .

chemically-induced diabetic rat data set
we have also applied pogo to a publicly available list of differentially expressed genes found in an experiment on chemically-induced diabetic rats and normal non-induced rats, using affymetrix arrays  <cit> . the original paper studied this in the context of erectile dysfunction in diabetes. the list of de genes is given in the supplementary information for that paper.

the original work on this data set found interesting go terms represented amongst the de genes  <cit> , but no multiple testing corrections were performed. we carried out a fatigo analysis, and found  <dig> terms significantly over-represented for fdr controlled at 5%: "oxygen and reactive oxygen species metabolism", "response to oxidative stress" and "response to chemical stimulus", with adjusted p-values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively. the next smallest adjusted p-value is  <dig> .

for this set of genes,  <dig> groups of go terms are found by posoc. table  <dig> gives the most significant groups, with their adjusted p-values. pogo finds  <dig> posoc groups significant at fdr = 5%. the second group, "extracellular matrix organisation and biosynthesis" is of interest because it incorporates collagen and elastin related terms. this makes sense in the context of vascular changes in erectile dysfunction. the first and third, "lipid metabolism" and "oxygen and reactive oxygen species metabolism", are known to be relevant in diabetes .

fatigo finds terms corresponding to the third posoc group, but not the first two.

transgenic and wildtype arabidopsis data set
our third application of pogo is to a data set from an experiment comparing transgenic and wildtype arabidopsis plants, using affymetrix arrays  <cit> . the transgenic plants express a brassica primary metabolic enzyme. they were observed in the original work to have enhanced levels of glucosinolate . the list of de genes is given in the supplementary information for that paper.

pogo finds three posoc groups significant when controlling fdr at 5% . the first one, "response to hormone stimulus", is a parent of a go term found in  <cit> : "response to auxin stimulus". in the original work, patterns in expression profiles of known genes were identified that suggest perturbation of sulfate metabolism. the second and third posoc groups found by pogo, "sulfate assimilation" and "sulfate reduction, aps pathway", are close to "sulfate metabolism" in the go graph. the next two terms, "response to temperature" and "cysteine metabolism", which have adjusted p-values of just over 5%, are also interesting. the former is a parent of the term "response to heat" identified in  <cit> . the term "cysteine metabolism" is also interesting in this context, as gsl is synthesized from methionine  <cit>  and methionine is derived from cysteine  <cit> . this is also connected to "sulfate reduction, aps pathway", as the aps pathway in plants is part of the process of synthesizing cysteine from sulfate  <cit> .

for this data set, fatigo finds  <dig> significant go terms . fatigo finds the terms "response to hormone stimulus", "response to temperature" and "sulfur utilization" .

all other adjusted p-values are greater than  <dig> 

comparison of individual and group analyses
here we present a comparison of the individual and group analyses for the cd <dig> data set. table  <dig> shows the go terms ranked the highest by fatigo , with their membership of posoc groups. note that none of these terms were found significant in the fatigo analysis. it can be seen that  <dig> out of the  <dig> top-ranked terms are members or immediate ancestors of at least one significant posoc group. the others are too high up in the graph  to belong to posoc groups. the most general go terms are not very useful for functional analysis, as they are not specific enough. we see that grouping terms which are close in the graph has enabled us to find a significant region of the graph, where the individual term tests were not found significant.

posoc group membership of the most over-represented go terms found by fatigo. "ia" in the membership column indicates the term is an immediate ancestor  of one of the significant posoc groups. note that none of these terms were found significant by the fatigo analysis.

not only has grouping terms improved the statistical power, it has also improved the interpretation of the results. figure  <dig> shows part of the ontology containing several of the most over-represented go terms from the fatigo analysis . as shown in the graph, these are very close to each other in the ontology. thus it makes sense to declare the region significantly over-represented rather than looking at each term separately.

one way of thinking about the amount of dependence between the statistical tests is to calculate the number of tests each gene appears in, since genes being annotated to multiple go terms causes dependence between them. for the term-by-term analysis this is the number of individual go terms a gene is annotated to. for the group analysis it is the number of posoc groups the gene belongs to. amongst the genes represented on the u74a chip, approximately 1/ <dig> belong to fewer posoc groups than individual terms, 3/ <dig> belong to the same number of posoc groups as individual terms, and 1/ <dig> belong to more posoc groups than individual terms . we see that there is an overall reduction in the number of tests each gene appears in, and therefore an overall reduction in the dependency between tests.

sensitivity to posoc parameters
we have investigated the sensitivity of the pogo results to changes in two posoc parameters: firstly the choice of score function sij

"response to pest, pathogen or parasite" and "response to wounding" are replaced by "response to external biotic stimulus" and "response to stress", which are very close in the go graph. all that has changed is that slightly different terms have been designated as cluster heads.

CONCLUSIONS
we have introduced the idea of finding regions of the go graph which are over or under-represented amongst differentially expressed genes, rather than testing each go node individually. we have applied the method to three data sets in three different organisms, one knock-out v. wildtype, one transgenic v. wildtype and one with a chemically induced phenotype. in all three cases, using the group analysis we find meaningful categories which would not have been found when testing individual go terms.

the way in which go terms are grouped together is crucial to the success of the group analysis. the posoc method seems to be a sensible way to summarise the locations of the genes in the go graph. it does however retain a considerable amount of dependence between the groups. this is inevitable, since annotation to any given go term implies annotation to all ancestor terms .

the cluster heads found by posoc are rather general terms. from a biological point of view, it would of course be preferable to test more specific terms. we have found that in the current version of posoc it is difficult to obtain more specific cluster heads. however, if we were to use groups of more specific terms we would start to run into the problems of increasing numbers of tests and few genes annotated to each group. we have found that with the current level of specificity, testing posoc groups can find interesting results. in this implementation, we have not addressed the issues of uncertainties in gene annotation  <cit>  or the uncertainty in which genes are differentially expressed: both the go annotation igia
