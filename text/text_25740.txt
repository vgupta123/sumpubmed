BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii is ubiquitous and the causative agent of q fever, a zoonotic disease  <cit> . domestic ruminants are often asymptomatic carriers of c. burnetii and are considered the most important reservoir and source for human q fever infection  <cit> . however, other animal species like birds, reptiles, arthropods or pets can also be infected and possibly transmit the disease to humans  <cit> .

c. burnetii can cause abortions and stillbirths in goats and sheep, and infertility and endometritis in cattle  <cit> . infected animals shed bacteria mainly through milk, faeces, vaginal mucus and birth products  <cit> . inhalation of c. burnetii contaminated aerosols is the main route of infection for humans. c. burnetii can be transported by the wind several kilometres far from the original infected source; direct contact with animals or c. burnetii infected birth products is not always necessary  <cit> .

considering the impact of c. burnetii on human and animal health, the study of potential sources of infection and the characterization of strains present in an area is of great epidemiological importance. genotypic characterization of coxiella burnetii is a prerequisite for surveillance purposes and for epidemiological investigation of q fever outbreaks. this information is necessary to evaluate the epidemiological link between the source of the outbreak and human cases, with the final objective of establishing control measures in potential animal hosts involved in the life cycle.

several techniques have been used to genotype and characterize c. burnetii strains. techniques such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis were able to classify c. burnetii isolates in different groups  <cit> . dna restriction fingerprints and separation by sds-page differentiated six genomic groups  <cit> . the analysis of the sequences of certain genes such as com <dig>  icd or mucz has been used for differentiating c. burnetii isolates  <cit> . more recently, multiple locus variable number tandem repeats analysis   <cit>  and multispacer sequence typing   <cit>  proved to be reliable techniques, reproducible, and with a high discriminatory power. in addition, these techniques do not require previous cultivation of the bacteria which is very difficult and requires biosafety level  <dig> conditions, and can be implemented directly on clinical and/or environmental samples.

q fever is an endemic disease in ruminants in several regions of spain. recent seroprevalence studies carried out in northern, central and southern spain revealed the importance of domestic ruminants as reservoir for this zoonosis  <cit> , with herd seroprevalence ranging between 30% and 75% depending on the ruminant species, and individual seroprevalence ranging between 6% and 60%. however, information on the genotypic diversity of c. burnetii isolates from domestic ruminants in spain is limited  <cit> . the aim of this study was to identify the c. burnetii mlva and mst genotypes that infect livestock in spain and to compare them to other european genotypes.

methods
samples
a total of  <dig> samples from  <dig> goat herds ,  <dig> dairy cattle herds  and  <dig> sheep flocks  were included in the study. details on the geographic origin of the samples, year of collection, type of reproductive disorders at the time of sampling, and number and type of samples collected in each farm are shown in table  <dig>  ovine and caprine samples were collected for laboratory diagnosis by clinical veterinarians as part of the usual clinical practice on farms with abortions or reproductive problems, and spanish ethical guidelines  and animal welfare regulations were strictly respected. all herd owners had given an informed consent prior to the study. samples from cattle farms were collected within a research project on q fever in dairy cattle farms and experimental work was officially approved by competent local authorities . environmental samples consisted on aerosol samples and dust taken from animal premises. air was sampled using a sartorius air sampler  at a flow rate of 100 l/min for 10 min. and particles were collected in gelatine filters which were processed for dna extraction.

dna extraction and pcr
all the samples were subjected to dna extraction using the biosprint  <dig> dna blood kit  following the procedure as described before  <cit> . to rule out contamination, negative controls were included during the dna extraction process every ten  samples or after each placenta sample. extraction controls and pcr negative  controls were subjected to pcr amplification along with the field samples. conventional pcr  <cit>  was used to detect the presence of c. burnetii dna. after pcr confirmation, samples were analyzed by quantitative real time pcr  in order to quantify the bacterial burden using the commercial kit lsi taq-vet coxiella burnetii  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. this is a duplex qpcr assay that targets the is <dig> insertion element of c. burnetii and includes a probe targeting the housekeeping gene gapdh used as internal amplification control  to reveal possible inhibitors. pcr was performed using an abi  <dig> fast thermocycler .

multiple locus variable number tandem-repeat analysis 
two multicolor multiplex pcr assays were applied targeting six microsatellite markers containing either six or seven base pairs  repeat units:  <dig> hexanucleotide repeat markers  and  <dig> heptanucleotide repeat markers .

primer sequences were used as described before  <cit> . pcr was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing  <dig> u of faststart taq dna polymerase ,  <dig>  mm dntp’s, 4 mm mgcl <dig> in 1x reaction buffer,  <dig>  –  <dig>  μm of amplification primers and 5 μl of dna sample. amplification products were analyzed on a megabace  <dig> automated dna analysis platform . electropherograms were analyzed using fragment profiler  <dig>  . dna from the nine mile strain  was used as a reference. the number of repeats in each marker was determined by extrapolation using the sizes of the obtained fragments relative to those obtained using dna from the nine mile strain. according to the in silico analysis, the genotype of the nine mile strain is 9-27-4-6-4- <dig> for markers ms23-ms24-ms27-ms28-ms33-ms <dig>  respectively. to study the genetic similarity between the mlva genotypes obtained in the different ruminant species the minimum spanning tree method was used.

multispacer sequence typing 
a subset of  <dig> samples was selected for mst analyses according to animal species, sample source and origin. methods and all sequences of primers have been previously detailed  <cit> , and  <dig> out of the  <dig> spacers that exhibited higher variation  were selected for genotyping. each 20 μl amplification reaction contained  <dig>  μm of amplification primers,  <dig> u of faststart taq dna polymerase ,  <dig>  mm dntp’s,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> in 1x reaction buffer and 5 μl of dna sample. after amplification, pcr products were cleaned and sequencing was performed using the forward and reverse primers. sequence products were analyzed on a megabace  <dig> automated dna analysis platform  and using bionumerics software . the genotypes identified by mst were compared to genotypes included in the mst database containing c. burnetii genotypes from countries throughout europe and from several non-european countries .

RESULTS
all  <dig> samples were qpcr positive with cycle threshold  values below  <dig> and all of them were genotyped by mlva. eleven mlva genotypes were identified in  <dig>  of the goat, sheep and cattle specimens; partial mlva genotypes were obtained in  <dig> samples , and in  <dig> samples  no mlva profile was obtained . in  <dig> of the samples  that yielded a partial genotype , the combination of identified alleles did not match with any of the full mlva genotypes found, suggesting that they corresponded to different types. three different mlva genotypes were found in  <dig> goat farms;  <dig> mlva genotypes were identified in  <dig> cattle herds; and  <dig> mlva genotypes were identified in  <dig> sheep flocks . genotype s was the most abundant and present in all three ruminant species , being particularly widespread in sheep . genotype t was found in goats and sheep. multiple genotypes were identified in different samples obtained from the same farm, e.g. in farm sh <dig>  genotype aa was identified in samples taken from aborted ewes, and two different genotypes  were identified in air samples sampled during the next two reproductive seasons .

discussion
molecular methods are used to characterize strains and to determine relationships between isolates causing disease. in the case of q fever, mlva and mst techniques have been incorporated for genotyping of c. burnetii strains since both techniques can be performed directly on clinical and environmental samples without previous cultivation of bacteria  <cit> . in the current study mlva typing has been performed based on  <dig> loci on  <dig> c. burnetii-positive samples to study the genetic background of this bacterium in domestic ruminants in spain.

mlva typing revealed a substantial genetic diversity among c. burnetii from domestic ruminants in northern spain as shown in the minimum spanning tree, with  <dig> distinct genotypes being identified. none of the mlva profiles found here were similar to the profiles identified in the q fever outbreak episodes in the netherlands  <cit>  or poland  <cit> . the mlva genotypes  described in the current study have been found before, indicating a wide dissemination of the described mlva genotypes throughout europe. mlva genotypes i, j and m have been found in cattle milk from france, netherlands, portugal, spain and switzerland  <cit> , and have also been incidentally found in  <dig> human clinical samples  from france, according to an in-house database containing  <dig> different c. burnetii mlva genotypes from  <dig> human, caprine, ovine and cattle clinical samples and cows milk obtained from canada, france, germany, the netherlands, portugal, qatar, russia, saudi arabia, slovak republic, spain, switzerland, united kingdom and usa. moreover, mlva genotypes s and t have also been incidentally found in  <dig> human clinical samples  from france and portugal and in  <dig> ruminant samples  from portugal  <cit> .

in addition,  <dig> new mlva profiles were identified  which so far have not been detected in human or animal samples. however, some of these new genotypes differ in only one marker from other previously defined and may represent microvariants of the founder genotype.

interestingly, variations in mlva genotypes were observed throughout consecutive reproductive seasons in some sheep farms. this was the case on farm sh <dig>  where genotypes detected in air samples were different from those detected in aborted ewes. this also happened in farms sh <dig> and sh <dig>  where partial genotypes in environmental or animal samples were different. typing data provided important epidemiological information about the sources of infection, and explained previous observations when c. burnetii appeared in environmental surfaces while no animal shedders were present in the sheep flocks  <cit> .

since several c. burnetii genotypes can be present on a farm, btm samples might be contaminated with several different genotypes. however, apart from one sample  that could not be typed, clean chromatograms were obtained by mst in all btm samples tested in this study, suggesting the presence of only one genotype per btm sample. this was also supported by the mlva results.

looking at mlva genotyping results on individual milk samples, apart from one sample from farm dc <dig>  only one genotype was detected per individual milk sample and per farm, as shown in farms dc <dig> and dc <dig>  in the sample from farm dc <dig> , more than one allele per locus was observed, suggesting the presence of at least two or more different mlva genotypes. in addition, the presence of highly similar c. burnetii genotypes  in cattle milk may indicate a widespread dissemination of a specific cattle-adapted strain, as previously reported  <cit> .

mlva typing has shown to be less laborious and more discriminatory than mst  <cit> . however, mst has the advantage of using standardized nomenclature, and having databases that allow easy comparison of results between laboratories and studies. it is interesting that the mst genotype involved in the human q fever outbreak in the netherlands , linked to goats and sheep and found also in germany and france  <cit> , was not detected in the present study. however, the most common genotype , which was identified in the three ruminant species in spain, had been identified before in human q fever cases in france, and recently in portugal  <cit> . other mst genotypes detected in this study, had also been previously reported. mst <dig>  detected here in goats and probably present in sheep , has been found before in human samples and in one ovine sample from spain, france and usa, and in human q fever chronic cases from portugal  <cit> . mst <dig>  found only on  <dig> goat farm was isolated before from human and animal  clinical samples in france, italy, romania, greece, slovak republic and germany according to the mst database . finally, mst <dig>  found here in cattle, had been identified in animal and human clinical samples from france, germany, netherlands and usa  <cit> . human isolates need to be genotyped with the same techniques used here on animal samples to identify the most important animal source for human q fever infection in this spanish region. the only genotyping study carried out in spain, used pcr and rlb hybridization to determine the presence/absence of  <dig> orfs in order to compare c. burnetii isolates from domestic ruminants  and human cases . the authors identified some related genomic groups in c. burnetii isolated from humans, sheep and goats, but not from cattle  <cit> . this is in agreement with the results obtained in the netherlands, where prevalence of c. burnetii dna in dairy cattle is high  <cit>  but mlva and mst genotypes detected in cattle are different from those involved in the human q fever outbreak  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the distribution of c. burnetii genotypes present in a region is critical to identify the major sources of infection, and implement efficient farm-based control measures to reduce human exposure to the pathogen. however, it is necessary to harmonize genotyping techniques to be used in coxiella epidemiological studies, so that results can be exchanged and readily comparable among different laboratories and studies. likewise, a common website where all typing data can be submitted and easily accessed is necessary for timely identification of new strains.
