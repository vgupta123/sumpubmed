BACKGROUND
important pathogenic species of coagulase-positive and negative staphylococcus  are s. aureus and s. epidermidis, respectively, which are frequently isolated from the environment and infected animals and humans  <cit> . s. aureus can cause severe blood infections and necrotizing fasciitis in humans, wound infection and mastitis in cattle, horses, pigs, and goats, exudative epidermitis in pigs, pyoderma in horses, dogs, and cats, pyemic sheep  <cit> . as an opportunistic pathogen, cns occasionally cause subclinical or clinical mastitis. for example, in cattle mastitis can be caused by s. capitis, s. chromogenes, s. cohnii, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. hominis, s. simulans, s. warneri, s. hyicus, and s. caseolyticus; in goats by s. caprae; and in cattle and sheep by s. xylosus  <cit> . however, cns can damage breast tissue to increase the somatic cell counts and decrease milk quality and production  <cit> . the identification of cns species is essential to determine their pathogenicity and to develop management practices to prevent mastitis. due to difficult and expensive procedures for identifying these organisms, many laboratories do not perform these assays.

as opportunistic pathogens, s. aureus and s. epidermidis can also cause bacteremia, subacute endocarditis, and can form biofilms on heart valve prostheses, shunts, total joint arthroplasty or surgical sutures in humans  <cit> . some s. aureus isolates possess a staphylococcal enterotoxin , which is a virulence factor for foodborne disease and can form several products from se genes, designates sea - seu  <cit> . these se genes are associated with host-specific infection, such as seb for foodborne infection in humans, sea for bovine infection  <cit> , and sec for mastitis in goats and bovine  <cit> . however, more than  <dig> se genes were identified in isolates obtained from goats  <cit> . as the most prevalent pathogen in both hospitals and communities, s. aureus can become methicillin -resistant s. aureus  by the introduction of an exogenous mobile staphylococcal chromosomal cassette, mec , encoding a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein 2a responsible for methicillin/oxacillin resistance  <cit> . based on variations in the ccr operon and mec complexes, at least seven sccmec types have been identified  <cit> . moreover, methicillin-resistant cns has been identified in animals  <cit> .

the extensive use of antibiotics in hospitals and animals has increased the emergence of mdr staphylococcus  <cit> . since the emergence of mrsa isolated from humans in the 1960s  <cit> , mrsa has been frequently isolated in hospitals, dogs, and horses as a zoonotic pathogen  <cit> . our recent study characterized mdr s. aureus from dairy goats in 2006- <dig> and no mrsa was isolated  <cit> . the current study investigated the prevalent staphylococcus spp. and characterized the mdr-s. aureus and mrsa isolates collected from goats in  <dig> by nucleotide sequencing, pulse-field gel electrophoresis  analysis and polymerase chain reaction  analysis to elucidate the origins of mrsa isolates and the se types associated with mastitis in goats.

RESULTS
identification of staphylococcus species
in total,  <dig> samples were collected from six bodily regions of dairy goats and three environmental sources in  <dig>  among  <dig> %  samples with bacterial growth on blood agar,  <dig> staphylococcal strains and  <dig> non-staphylococcal strains were identified. five major staphylococcus spp. were identified and listed in decreasing order of isolate number: s. lentus , s. aureus , s. epidermidis , s. xylosus  and s. caprae , and others .

prevalent staphylococcus species in different sampling locations and farms
staphylococcal species were frequently isolated from milk, anus, vagina, nasal cavity, and udders . however, the predominant infection sites differed between s. aureus and cns. on average, the prevalence of s. aureus was  <dig>  and  <dig> % for goats and environmental samples, respectively, and differed among farms and body regions of goats . in contrast to being absent in the anus and dorsum, s. aureus was predominant in the nasal cavity , vagina , and milk ; in addition, cns was prevalent in the milk , vagina , and anus .the highest prevalence of s. aureus was found in farm a, followed by farms d, c and b. in contrast, the highest prevalence of cns was found in goats on farm d followed by farms c, b, and a.

antimicrobial susceptibility
fifteen antimicrobial agents were used to characterize s. aureus strains and could be divided into  <dig> antibiograms. nearly all isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin, gentamycin, neomycin, and vancomycin; in addition, over 60% of the isolates were also resistant to penicillin , ampicillin , cephalothin, tetracycline , and oxytetracycline  . in this study,  <dig>  mrsa isolates were identified in nasal cavity, vagina, and goat milk only. isolates from the nasal cavity exhibited the highest antimicrobial resistance. compared with the antimicrobial resistance found for isolates identified in 2006- <dig>  isolates from  <dig> revealed an increase in resistance to ampicillin, bacitracin , cloxacin , oxacillin , penicillin g, and streptomycin  . although  <dig> % of isolates were resistant to more than one antimicrobial agent; the most prevalent antibiograms were aotpt  and abclotoxpst . the antibiogram number varied among farms from six in farm a to five in farm b, four in farm d and two in farm c. differences in antibiograms and their number may indicate the different bacterial sources in each farm. the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of  <dig> mrsa isolates to methicillin ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> Î¼g/ml, and varied among farms and bodily region. the highest mic was found in isolates collected from the nasal cavity , followed by goat milk , and vagina .

staphylococcal enterotoxin types
of the nine enterotoxin genes examined, only sec and see were identified in s. aureus isolates and no se genes were found in  <dig> cns strains . eight out of  <dig> s. aureus strains isolated from milk of  <dig> goats with mastitis were shown to possess sec. pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis of sec pcr products revealed an identical alui restriction pattern for all strains. in  <dig> s. aureus bovine strains, only sea was identified in three strains.

discussion
cns strains s. lentus, s. epidermidis, s. xylosus, and s. caprae, and s. aureus were identified as the predominant species infecting goats in this study. s. aureus and cns differed in prevalence and bodily location in goats . additionally, cns and s. aureus accounted for  <dig>  and 11% of infections, respectively, in the milk of goats with mastitis  <cit> , and  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, in the milk of dairy cows and goats in taiwan  <cit> . in animals, the prevalence of s. aureus differed among countries, such as  <dig> % in the united kingdom  <cit> ,  <dig> % in canada  <cit> ,  <dig> % in usa  <cit> ,  <dig> % in ethiopia  <cit> ,  <dig> % in korea  <cit> , and  <dig> % in uruguay  <cit> . however, s. aureus accounts for  <dig> %  of staphylococcal infections in goats  <cit> . in taiwan, s. aureus infection in goats increased from  <dig> %   <cit>  up to  <dig> %   <cit>  and  <dig> %  in this study. sanitation may be another important factor that leads to an increase in s. aureus infection. indeed, sanitation could reduce the s. aureus infection from  <dig>  to  <dig> % or from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  <cit> . in taiwan, s. aureus infection in milk ranged from 0- <dig> % among farms  <cit> . in the present study, the prevalence ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for s. aureus and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for cns among farms, suggesting that cns infection is more common in goats.

early reports indicated that staphylococcal infections in goat bodily regions differed and ranged from  <dig> %  in the armpits up to  <dig> %  on the skin of udders and mamilla, and contributed to only  <dig> % contamination of the apparatus  <cit> . although lacking statistical analysis in this study, staphylococcus was identified in  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of milk and udders, respectively , suggesting that staphylococcus is a major bacterial cause of mastitis in goats that can then infect humans through unsanitary milk. as an important virulence factor causing foodborne disease in humans, predominant se genes are associated with outbreaks in certain countries, such as sea in france  <cit> , seb in eastern slovakia, tehran, and japan  <cit> , sec- <dig> and sec- <dig> in taiwan  <cit> . furthermore, particular sec types is also associated with food-related staphylococcus spp.  <cit> , in s. aureus, and cns isolated from the milk of sheep  <cit> , and in s. aureus collected from sheep or cows with mastitis  <cit> . additionally, sea was determined to be the major type in s. aureus from cows with mastitis  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  sec and sea were the major se genotypes found in goats and cows, respectively, and sec was associated with mastitis in goats. these data confirmed the importance of the sec gene involved in goat mastitis pathogenesis  <cit> . in cattle, the sec toxin  was previously shown to significantly increase somatic cell counts and enhance the severity of the mastitis in acute mastitis  <cit> . although se genes have been found in cns species, such as s. xylosus, s. warneri, and s. chromogenes isolated from cows and goats  <cit> , they were only identified in cps but not cns isolated previously in taiwan  <cit>  and in the present study . as an opportunistic pathogen that can cause mastitis in cattle and goats  <cit> , s. aureus infection can also cause clinical symptoms in cattle  <cit>  but is typically asymptomatic in goats  <cit> .

using penicillin, ampicillin, and tetracycline antibiotics to treat bacterial infections in animals often increases resistance to these antibiotics. in cattle, s. aureus or other staphylococcus spp. causing mastitis were more resistance to penicillin and ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and oxytetracycline  <cit> . our data showed an increased resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, and cephalothin from  <dig> to  <dig>  in addition to the appearance of mrsa isolates from goats in  <dig> . furthermore, the mrsa isolates identified in this study belonged to the major nosocomial sccmec types: sccmec type ii and iii  <cit> . zoonotic transfer of mrsa has been reported between horses and humans in the usa  <cit> , between cattle and humans in korea  <cit> , and between livestock and humans in taiwan  <cit> . our data indicate that mrsa isolates may have been acquired from humans or transmitted from different goat breeding farms.

pfge analysis is typically performed to trace the pathogens responsible for outbreaks. containing a thick cell wall, s. aureus must be treated with lysostaphin, not lysozyme, to break the pentaglycine linkage within the peptidoglycan  <cit> . for genomic analysis of s. aureus, genomic dna cannot be digested by restriction enzyme smai and diverse genomic variations in size  <cit>  limit the utility of pfge analysis. however, pulsotypes appear to correlate with human disease. pulsotype d s. aureus is associated with more severe symptoms than pulsotype type c bacteria that only cause mild symptoms  <cit> . in taiwan, mrsa accounts for 53-83% of s. aureus isolates from hospitals  <cit>  and the major pulsotypes of human mrsa are pulsotype a, followed by types c and d  <cit> . in this study, pulsotype a was also the most prevalent type of goat mrsa isolate . additionally, pfge analysis also revealed diverse sources of mrsa in farm a and a single origin in farms b and d .

CONCLUSIONS
the current study was the first report of the appearance of mrsa strains and sec-associated mastitis in goats from taiwan. analysis of sccmec types and pulsotypes revealed that the genetically diverse mrsa strains might have been acquired from humans or transferred from different goat breeding farms.
