BACKGROUND
escherichia coli, a bacterium widely spread among warm-blooded animals, has been used as an indicator of water fecal contamination. fecal pollution in water can indicate the presence of waterborne pathogens, such as salmonella and giardia  <cit> . the identification of the major animal source of fecal contamination is extremely important for the effective management of water systems  <cit> . therefore, several methods of bacterial source tracking , using e. coli strains, have been developed to identify the animal source of fecal contamination. among these methods are ribotyping, rep-pcr, antibiotic resistance profiles, among others  <cit> . however, until now, only one putative human-specific strain  <cit>  and one putative animal-specific strain have been found  <cit> .

escherichia coli strains can be assigned to one of the main phylogenetic groups: a, b <dig>  b <dig> or d  <cit> . according to lecointre et al.  <cit> , groups a and b <dig> are sister groups whereas group b <dig> is included in an ancestral branch. these phylo-groups apparently differ in their ecological niches, life-history  <cit>  and some characteristics, such as their ability to exploit different sugar sources, their antibiotic-resistance profiles and their growth rate  <cit> . walk et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the majority of the e. coli strains that are able to persist in the environment belong to the b <dig> phylogenetic group. furthermore, genome size differs among these phylo-groups, with a and b <dig> strains having smaller genomes than b <dig> or d strains  <cit> . johnson et al.  <cit>  found that strains from phylo-groups b <dig> and d contained more virulence factors than strains from the phylo-groups a and b <dig> 

the extraintestinal pathogenic strains usually belong to groups b <dig> and d  <cit> , the commensal strains to groups a and b <dig>  <cit> , whilst the intestinal pathogenic strains belong to groups a, b <dig> and d  <cit> . clermont et al.  <cit>  have developed a pcr based method to characterize the phylo-groups using the genetic markers chua, yjaa and the dna fragment tspe <dig> c <dig>  to increase the discrimination power of e. coli population analyses, it has been proposed the use of subgroups a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  that are determined by the combination of the genetic markers  <cit> .

some authors analyzed the distribution of the main phylogenetic groups among e. coli strains isolated from human and animal feces. gordon and cowling  <cit>  observed that the relative abundance of phylogenetic groups among mammals is dependent on the host diet, body mass and climate. escobar-páramo et al.  <cit>  analyzing fecal strains isolated from birds, non-human mammals and humans, observed the prevalence of groups d and b <dig> in birds, a and b <dig> in non-human mammals, and a and b <dig> in humans. these authors concluded that one of the main forces that shapes the genetic structure of e. coli populations among the hosts is domestication. baldy-chudzik et al.  <cit>  analyzed feces from zoo animals and found a prevalence of group b <dig> in herbivorous animals and a prevalence of group a in carnivorous and omnivorous animals.

the aim of this work was to analyze the distribution of phylogenetic groups and subgroups in feces from different animals and to assess the potential application of this analysis in identifying the major source of fecal contamination in the environment.

RESULTS
in this work,  <dig> e. coli strains isolated from feces of different animals and  <dig> strains isolated from a sewage source were allocated into four phylogenetic groups  and seven subgroups . as shown in table  <dig>  the strains analyzed were distributed among the seven subgroups, and the prevalence indexes calculated for the subgroups were: a <dig> =  <dig> %, a <dig> =  <dig> %, b <dig> = 100%, b <dig> = 50%, b <dig> =  <dig> %, d <dig> =  <dig>  and d <dig> =  <dig> %. it is interesting to note that strains from group b <dig> were found among all the analyzed hosts, whereas strains from subgroup b <dig> were found only in humans.

the graphic representation shown in figure  <dig> allowed the identification of remarkable trends among the e. coli strains from the different hosts. humans are the only host bearing strains from all the phylo-groups, except for subgroup a <dig>  the strains found in the pig samples were also distributed among all phylo-groups, except for subgroup b <dig>  which contains only strains from the human samples. most of the strains from the chicken samples were included in subgroup a <dig>  that is, these strains did not reveal the presence of the genetic markers investigated. most of the strains of cows, goats and sheep fell within group b <dig>  despite the fact that four strains of cows and three of chickens were assigned to subgroup d <dig> and two strains of goats and two of cows were assigned to group a <dig> 

a chi-square value of  <dig> ,  <dig> degrees of freedom , p <  <dig> , was obtained from a contingency table with the phylogenetic groups distribution among the hosts, allowing the null hypothesis, which states that there is no association between the hosts and the groups, to be rejected . this result suggests a significant difference in the e. coli population structure among the animals analyzed. a chi-square test at the subgroup level was performed to verify the existence of an association between the hosts and the phylogenetic subgroup. the calculated  <dig>  chi-square value , leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis . a chi-square test was also performed to verify the association between the hosts and the genetic markers . the result  indicated that the genetic markers are differently distributed among the hosts .

the shannon and simpson diversity indexes  <cit>  were used to analyze the phylogenetic subgroup data. as shown in table  <dig>  the largest diversity indexes were observed for humans  and pigs , whilst the smallest diversity was observed for goats . the pianka's similarity index was calculated using the phylogenetic subgroup distribution for each pair of hosts . the results indicated that humans and pigs exhibited a similarity of  <dig> %, whereas cows, goats and sheep exhibited an average similarity of 96%.

a correspondence analysis  was performed using the phylogenetic groups and subgroups distribution and the genetic markers distribution . the bidimensional representation of subgroups distribution in each host is shown in figure  <dig>  this bidimensional representation can explain  <dig> % of the total inertia. the horizontal axis represents  <dig> % of the total inertia, which is responsible for the major separation. according to this analysis, the subgroup distribution was similar for cows, goats and sheep and for pigs and humans . a sewage sample was included in the ca . this sample included the following subgroups: a <dig> , a <dig> , d <dig>  and d <dig> . as expected, this subgroup distribution was similar to the one found for humans .

the ca using the genetic markers distribution resulted in a bidimensional representation that can explain 100% of the total inertia , being the horizontal axis responsible for  <dig> % of it. according to this analysis, the genetic markers distribution was similar for cows, goats and sheep and for humans, chickens and pigs. the sewage sample, in which six strains presented the chua gene, five the yjaa gene and two the tspe <dig> c <dig> fragment, was plotted near the human sample .

the discrimination power of the phylogenetic groups a, b <dig>  b <dig> and d was also tested using ca . according to this analysis, the bidimensional representation of the phylo-groups relative abundance can explain  <dig> % of the total inertia, being the horizontal axis responsible for  <dig> % of it. this analysis revealed that the phylo-group distribution among cows, goats and sheep, which presented a predominance of strains of the b <dig> group, was similar. humans, chickens and pigs remained separated. e. coli strains isolated from two rivers, jaguari and sorocaba, located in the state of são paulo, brazil, and previously analyzed by orsi et al.  <cit> , were also included in this ca analysis . the strain composition of the jaguari river included  <dig> strains of group a,  <dig> strains of group b <dig> and six strains of group d. the sorocaba river included  <dig> strains of group a,  <dig> strains of group b <dig>  one strain of group b <dig> and eight strains of group d. the strains distribution among the phylo-groups, from both rivers, was similar to the one observed for chickens and pigs. the sewage sample was also included in this ca and once again, this sample was similar to humans .

the results obtained with the classifier tools blr and pls-da using the genetic markers are summarized in table  <dig>  the separation between e. coli strains of omnivorous and herbivorous mammals presented the lowest classification error rate , while the highest classification error rate  was observed between e. coli strains of humans and non-humans. both classifier tools demonstrated that the chua and the yjaa genes were more informative to discriminate between e. coli strains of human and non-human sources . the pls-da tool showed that the yjaa gene and the tspe <dig> c <dig> dna fragment were more informative to discriminate between e. coli strains of herbivorous and omnivorous mammals. the error rate for blr and pls-da was higher in the prediction of human than in non-human samples . however, when the feeding habit of mammals was considered in the separation, the error rate for both tools was higher in the prediction of the herbivorous samples.

the classification was carried out between human and animal samples, between humans and non-humans mammals and between omnivorous and herbivorous mammals

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that phylogenetic subgroup, group and genetic markers distribution are not randomly distributed among the hosts analyzed. the results showed a similarity between the e. coli population structure of humans and pigs  and of cows, goats and sheep . humans and pigs exhibited the highest diversity indexes, while goats and sheep exhibited the lowest ones. using the simulations of the ecosim software  <cit> , it was possible to conclude that the diversity indexes are significantly different among the herbivorous and omnivorous mammals. the pianka's similarity index showed that the human sample was more similar to the pig sample . cows, goats and sheep also presented a high overlap , while chickens presented the lowest values.

cows, goats and sheep are ruminant mammals which differ in many gut characteristics from other animals. humans and pigs present common gut characteristics because they are monogastric animals . besides the gut characteristics, the diet of the host appears to have selected the phylo-group profile in the brazilian mammals analyzed in this work. omnivorous mammals presented a prevalence of phylo-group a, while the herbivorous mammals presented a prevalence of phylo-group b <dig>  previous research by gordon and cowling  <cit>  revealed a different result from ours, identifying a prevalence of strains of phylo-group b <dig> among herbivorous and omnivorous mammals and a prevalence of phylo-goup b <dig> among birds and carnivorous mammals, which supports their hypothesis of geographic effects in the e. coli population structure among hosts. however, they also concluded that phylo-groups a and b <dig> are "generalists" and b <dig> and d are "specialists", which is in agreement with our data since strains of group b <dig> were found in all the hosts analyzed, followed by subgroups a <dig> and a <dig>  on the other hand, subgroup b <dig> was present only in the human sample. therefore, our results suggest that b <dig> strains, especially subgroup b <dig>  could be a good indicator of human feces contamination.

group b <dig> was prevalent among the herbivorous hosts. however, this phylo-group is not a promising indicator of herbivorous feces contamination because it was found in all the hosts analyzed, and, apparently, most e. coli strains that are able to survive in the environment, belong to this group  <cit> . according to our data, the distribution analysis of phylo-groups a and d is a powerful discriminating tool since both groups presented a considerable contribution to the chi-square values .

the chua and yjaa genes were rarely found in strains of cows, goats and sheep but were commonly found in human, chicken and pig strains. sobieszczańska  <cit>  showed that  <dig> % of the enteroaggregative e. coli strains carried the chua gene, which encodes for a haem receptor. strains belonging to group b <dig> were not found in cows, goats and sheep. other studies have demonstrated that b <dig> and d strains are usually more pathogenic than a and b <dig> strains  <cit> . in fact, verocytotoxin-producing e. coli, like o157:h <dig>  belongs to group d  <cit>  and cattle are the main reservoirs of this pathogen. the prevalence of groups b <dig> and d and of the chua and yjaa genes in humans and pigs might suggest that fecal contamination by these animals can present a high risk of extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli. thus, the correct identification of this kind of fecal contamination can also be useful to the appropriate management of environmental pollution.

correspondence analysis is a descriptive/exploratory technique, based on chi-square values, that allows the exploration of the structure of the data. in the three ca models performed, similar distribution patterns were observed among e. coli strains of herbivorous mammals and among strains of omnivorous mammals. furthermore, the ca of subgroup distribution allowed the discrimination of omnivorous mammals. similar results were observed by baldy-chudzik et al.  <cit> . these authors suggested that the e. coli strains of group b <dig> are best adapted to herbivorous, whereas strains of group a are best adapted to omnivorous mammals. the three ca models correctly predicted the animal/human source of the external validation sample , indicating that a significant part of the e. coli phylo-group diversity was covered by the strains database, which reveals the stability of the models. e. coli samples from the jaguari and sorocaba rivers  <cit>  were also used to test the ca model based on phylo-group distribution. our analysis suggested that pigs were the major source of fecal contamination in both rivers, which is in agreement with orsi et al.  <cit> , confirming that the major source of fecal contamination of these rivers was non-human. therefore, these results indicate that the ca model can be efficiently applied in the discrimination of e. coli strains from different animal sources.

both classifier tools  and both validation methods  exhibited similar overall error rates for each strain separation analyzed. this way, the statistical method used did not show a significant interference in the obtained results. excluding the chicken sample, the best classification was obtained when the e. coli strains were separated according to the feeding habits of the hosts . although the classification error rates found could be considered high, similar error rates were observed in other bst studies  <cit> .

since it is very difficult to find host-specific strains or genetic markers  <cit> , in this work we propose a new approach to identify the animal source of fecal contamination in water systems. this approach is based on the specificity of the e. coli population structure instead of host-specific strains. geographic variation of the e. coli population structure was reported in the literature  <cit>  and since the relative abundance of phylo-groups among hosts can be easily characterized, this approach can be implemented in different regions of the world as a supplementary bacterial source tracking tool. although our data is consistent in showing the potential applicability of this approach, we are aware that there might be some limitations due to the limited number of fecal pollution sources analyzed.
