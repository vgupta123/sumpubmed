BACKGROUND
eukaryotic genomes are very diverse in size, content, structure and mode of inheritance. the size of haploid genomes varies extensively. some microsporidia have genomes of a few mega base pairs , whereas amoeba, plants and animal genomes can be thousands of mb  <cit> . there are also large differences in genome organization within and between eukaryotic groups  <cit> . the frequency and occurrence of meiotic sex also varies extensively between eukaryotic lineages, even if it is problematic to determine whether a specific lineage undergoes meiosis or other kinds of genetic recombination  <cit> . very little is known about the variation of these various traits within and between different eukaryotic groups except for a selection of extensively studied fungi, plants and animals. we are currently performing a comparative genomics project on representatives from the microbial eukaryotic group diplomonadida , with the overall aim to deepening the understanding of the factors that shape eukaryotic genomes in general, and diplomonad genomes in particular.

diplomonads are a group of anaerobic, or micro-aerophilic, flagellated protists classified within excavata  <cit> . all members of the group, with the exception of the monokaryotic enteromonads, have double sets of nuclei, flagella and other organelles  <cit> . diplomonads are frequently found in environments depleted with oxygen, and the group contains pathogens, commensals and free-living species  <cit> . the intestinal parasite giardia intestinalis , a major cause of waterborne enteric disease in humans, is the most studied diplomonad  <cit> . there are currently seven different genotypes  identified within the g. intestinalis species complex; human infections are caused by genotypes a and b  <cit> . however, it has been suggested that the morphological species g. intestinalis should possibly be divided into several species based on host specificities and genetic differences  <cit> . the determination of the true phylogenetic relationships within the diplomonads is difficult. free-living hexamita and trepomonas are nested among pathogenic members of spironucleus. furthermore, enteromonads, are nested deep within classical diplomonads in molecular phylogenies, suggesting that these are secondarily monokaryotic, or that the diplokaryotic state have multiple origins within diplomonads  <cit> .

in this study we focus on spironucleus barkhanus and spironucleus salmonicida. both species were previously known as s. barkhanus. however, parasites causing systemic infections in atlantic salmon salmo salar, chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha and arctic char salvelinus alpinus  <cit> , are now classified as s. salmonicida  <cit> . these parasites have caused severe problems for fisheries  <cit> . the closely related s. barkhanus is a commensal in wild freshwater populations of arctic char and grayling thymallus thymallus  <cit> . these morphologically indistinguishable organisms are defined as separate species on the basis of their ecology  and that they form two clades in gene trees  <cit> . the genetic divergence is between 8% and 30% for the ribosomal rna, alpha-tubulin and glutamate dehydrogenase genes  <cit> . the atcc  <dig> strain of s. salmomicida is the most studied diplomonad on the genetic level outside the giardia genus  <cit> , although there is an ongoing genome project on spironucleus vortens  <cit> .

the genome projects on s. salmonicida and g. intestinalis revealed reduced and compact genomes with few, if any, genes with introns  <cit> . there are also variations between the diplomonad genomes. a number of lineage-specific genes obtained from bacteria were detected in s. salmonicida and the codon usages are drastically different  <cit> . in addition, all hexamitinid diplomonads  utilize an alternative genetic code, whereas the canonical code is used by members of the giardia genus  <cit>  the level of sequence divergence within diplomonad cells also vary extensively. both nuclei in the vegetative trophozoite stage of g. intestinalis are diploid  <cit> . in situ hybridization studies of g. intestinalis genotype a have shown that each nucleus contains at least one complete copy of the genome and that the two nuclei are partitioned equationally at cytokinesis  <cit> . allelic variations are expected to accumulate in the absence of genetic exchange between the two nuclei  <cit> . nevertheless, a very low frequency of sequence heterozygosity is present in the g. intestinalis genotype a  genome  <cit>  and no allelic sequence variation was reported from the s. salmonicida genome  <cit> . genetic exchange might occur between the nuclei, suggesting a mechanism that maintains a low sequence divergence  <cit> . however, the efficiency of such a mechanism appears to vary between closely related lineages; the draft g. intestinalis gs  genome revealed an overall allelic sequence divergence of  <dig> %  <cit> .

we have performed a comparative genomic project on s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida, including the generation of ~ <dig> expressed sequence tag  sequences from s. barkhanus and an estimation of genome sizes of both species. the goal was to increase the understanding of the tempo and mode of genomic structure and content evolution within the diplomonads. the present study present several unexpected observations such as large differences of diplomonad genome size and codon usage, and a high level of allelic sequence variation in s. barkhanus.

RESULTS
s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida are two morphologically indistinguishable protists which have recently been classified as two distinct species based on ecological and genetic data from a few genes  <cit> . we isolated s. barkhanus from the wild freshwater salmonid grayling  to further study the genetic differences between these two diplomonads. in vitro growth in tyi-s- <dig> medium was successfully established for both this new isolate and s. salmonicida , although, the optimal growth conditions differed. the generation time for s. barkhanus at 4°c in the presence of bile was approximately the same as the generation time for s. salmonicida at 15°c without bile. the morphology is indistinguishable  and the six anterior flagella contribute to the high speed swimming, even at 4°c .

origin of spironucleus gene repertoire
we constructed a cloneminer cdna library from rna harvested from s. barkhanus . approximately  <dig>  clones were randomly picked and sequenced. the obtained chromatograms were clustered into  <dig>  unique sequences.  <dig> of these showed similarity with e values less than 1e- <dig> to previously known protein-coding genes outside the spironuclues genus . putative orthologs were found for  <dig> of these among the sequences from the s. salmonicida genome survey  <cit> . the average identities were 84% and 76% on the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively. this is in the similar range as orthologous genes between the morphologically identical g. intestinalis genotype a  and b  isolates  <cit> , indicating large genetic divergence between morphologically similar diplomonad species.

we divided the identified protein coding genes into three classes based on their similarities to database sequences . the first class contain  <dig> proteins with highest similarities to giardia proteins  <cit> , strongly suggesting these to be present in the ancestral diplomonad cell. this class contains proteins performing basic functions in eukaryotic cells such as general metabolism, translation, flagellar function and chromatin structure. however, proteins performing functions with a more limited distribution among eukaryotes are also included. an enzyme involved in cyst-wall synthesis, two enzymes in the arginine dihydrolase pathway which enable the diplomonads to utilize arginine as an energy source under limited oxygen conditions  <cit> , and a-type flavoproteins which are widespread in anaerobic protists, but rare in other eukaryotes  <cit>  are all members of this class.

a second class consists of  <dig> genes with homologs present in the giardia genome, but which show higher similarities to homologs from organisms outside diplomonads. many of these probably represent divergent sequences of genes present in the common diplomonad ancestor; most of them show almost as high similarity to giardia genes. a number of ribosomal and proteasomal proteins are present in this class. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences with a cysteine content of the putative coding region of more than 10%  belong to this class. many show highest similarities to cysteine-rich proteins in ciliates, and the conserved motifs of g. intestinalis variant surface proteins  could not be found. this indicates a high sequence divergence of cysteine-rich proteins within diplomonads, as previously observed in the s. salmonicida genome survey  <cit> . indeed, these protein families were the most divergent between g. intestinalis wb and gs  <cit> . annexins is another protein family that is very divergent within diplomonads. alpha-giardins are annexin-like proteins in a  <dig> member giardia-specific protein family associated with different cytoskeleton and membrane structures  <cit> . all annexin-like proteins in spironucleus are more similar to annexins in other eukaryotes than to any alpha-giardin. for example, the putative amino acid sequence of contig <dig> shows 40% identity to xenopus laevis annexin a <dig>  but only 27% identity to g. intestinalis alpha- <dig> giardin. the most parsimonious explanation probably is that alpha-giardins evolved specifically in the giardia branch from typical eukaryotic annexins. however, an alternative explanation for the large divergence of annexin-like proteins in diplomonads is that one of the two studied lineages obtained the proteins via lateral gene transfer.

the third class of genes consists of  <dig> sequences without matches in the g. intestinalis genome . metabolic functions dominate among the  <dig> that do have putative annotations, including several peptidases, desulfoferredoxin, fructokinase, cartenoid isomerase and rubrerythrin , suggesting metabolic adaptation as a selection force for their maintenance in the s. barkhanus genome. detailed phylogenetic analyses, such as for selenophosphate synthetase , would be necessary to determine the origin of these genes; they have either been gained in the spironucleus lineage or been lost in the giardia lineage. lateral gene transfer has indeed previously been shown to contribute to adaptation within diplomonads and other eukaryotes  <cit> . in fact, ten of the s. barkhanus sequences have indeed close homologs among proteins identified as recently introduced via lateral gene transfer into the s. salmonicida genome . several of the other proteins also likely represent acquisitions in the spironucleus lineage, some maybe after the divergence between s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida. at any rate, this class contains candidate genes for the understanding of the diversifications of diplomonads, regardless of their origins, as exemplified below.

a triple function of uga as sole termination codon, selenocysteine codon and polyadenylation signal
spironucleus uses an alternative genetic code; uaa and uag encode glutamine, whereas uga is the sole termination codon  <cit> . a putative selenocysteine trna  was identified in the s. salmonicida genome indicating that all  <dig> codons might be used to encode amino acids in this organism  <cit> . here we discovered a putative selenophosphate synthetase , an enzyme marker for selenium utilization  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis shows the s. barkhanus homolog nested within bacterial seld sequences . furthermore, a s. salmonicida est with 40% identity over  <dig> amino acids to ciliate selenocysteine -specific elongation factor  was identified . thus, three gene signatures  for the sec-decoding trait  <cit>  have been identified in s. salmonicida or s. barkhanus. a weak similarity to selenoprotein w <dig>  a previously identified selenoprotein, was found within our dataset . a uga codon is found in the s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida homologs of selenoprotein w <dig> in the amino acid position where a selenocysteine is incorporated in other eukaryotes . together, these observations strongly suggest that these two diplomonads are able to incorporate sec into proteins using the uga codon. it is unknown how the translation machinery distinguish between termination and sec-insertion in s. barkhanus; no canonical sec-insertion sequences  could be detected within our dataset using erpin  <cit> .

no selenium utilization trait has been reported from giardia to our knowledge. indeed, no genes coding for homologs to selb or seld could be found in any of the available g. intestinalis genomes  <cit> , nor in the released sequences form the s. vortens project  <cit> . interestingly, these two species encode cysteine in the homologous position of the selenocysteine in selenoprotein w <dig> . exchanges between cys and sec within selenoproteins are frequent in evolution  <cit> . these observations indicate that g. intestinalis and s. vortens lack the sec-decoding trait. if so, sec-decoding capacity has either been lost independently in the s. vortens and g. intestinalis lineages, or been gained in the lineage leading to s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida. both gains and losses of the trait are common in bacterial evolution  <cit> . interestingly, the position of s. barkhanus selenophosphate synthetase nested within prokaryotic sequences in the phylogenetic tree  indicates a recent acquisition of that gene. furthermore, no homologs of selb or seld could be identified in trichomonas vaginalis, the nearest neighbour of diplomonads with an available genome sequence  <cit> . these findings circumstantially support a recent gain of the selenium utilization trait in the ancestor of s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida.

uga probably also function as a polyadenylation signal in s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida. the positions of the polya tail were mapped in  <dig> of the clustered sequences. the 3' untranslated regions were found to be short, around  <dig> bp . this is similar to the other studied diplomonads  <cit> , but unlike other eukaryotes  <cit> . the conservation pattern is very similar between s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida, with a strong positional correlation between the termination codon and the beginning of the polya-tail, but only weak conservation outside the uga codon, the only functional termination codon in spironucleus  <cit> . in both organisms there is a preference for a in the position two bases upstream of the termination codon and u immediately downstream   <cit> . in other studied eukaryotes, the distance between the polyadenylation signal and the polya site is conserved, whereas 3' untranslated regions vary in length  <cit> . the positional correlation between the termination codon and the polya site in s. barkhanus  and s. salmonicida  <cit>  suggests that the single termination codon  <cit>  likely also function as a polya signal, in addition to the function as a sec-codon in selenoproteins. interestingly, a eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit  <dig> that recognizes stop codons and terminates translation was also identified in this survey , which will make it possible to study the interaction between polyadenylation, translational termination and selenocysteine incorporation.

a drastic shift in codon usage between the genomes
several codons may code for the same amino acid in protein coding genes due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code. the main determinant for codon-usage lineage-variations among genomes often is genome-wide mutational processes, whereas selection typically is invoked to explain differences within genomes  <cit> . the codon usage of g. intestinalis can be explained by a combination of these forces where a subset of codons are preferred in highly expressed genes  <cit> . the genome survey of s. salmonicida revealed a similar pattern for the majority of the genes  <cit> . however, a minority of the s. salmonicida genes showed codon-usage patterns with high gc3s values close to  <dig> although the genome in general is g+c poor. these observations were very difficult to explain using the traditional interpretations  <cit> . here we take a comparative approach to study the codon usage in spironucleus.

s. barkhanus has a relatively g+c-poor genome; the average g+c-content of the est sequences is 41% and gc3s values below 40% for most genes , suggesting a general mutational bias towards a+t. we classify genes as "highly expressed" and "weakly expressed" if they have been found more than  <dig> times or less than  <dig> times, respectively, among the clones from the cdna library. the number of occurrences of a specific gene within a non-normalized cdna library is expected to be roughly correlated with the amount of mrna in the cells harvested for the library preparation. specific codons are preferred in highly expressed s. barkhanus genes, as previously found in s. salmonicida  <cit>  . the codon usage was explored in more detail by plotting the effective number of codons   <cit>  against the gc3s values  and by correspondence analyses on the relative synonymous codon usage . the s. barkhanus gc3s values are weakly correlated with expression levels , whereas the correspondence analysis clearly separates highly expressed genes from weakly expressed genes . this is in agreement with the observation that the preferred codons are a mixture of g+c rich and g+c poor codons  <cit> . overall, the s. barkhanus codon usage is similar to s. salmonicida, except that the variation in gc3s values appear less extreme in s. barkhanus  <cit>  .

this aspect of codon usage variation between s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida was studied in more detail by extracting homologous regions of  <dig> putatively orthologous genes from the two datasets. the s. barkhanus orthologs of s. salmonicida genes with unusually high gc3s values tend to have lower gc3s values . in s. salmonicida,  <dig> genes show gc3s values above 75%, whereas none of their putative s. barkhanus orthologs do . we plotted the difference between the putative orthologs against the frequency of non-synonymous changes in the gene , which is a measure of divergence, to examine whether the genes that show a drastic shift in gc3s values tend to represent divergent genes . many of the genes with large differences in gc3s show small non-synonymous divergences. thus, the drastic difference between the two genomes is unlikely due to erroneous assignments of orthologs. these observations suggest that divergent codon usages has emerged rather recently in a subset of the s. salmonicida genes  <cit> , or been lost in the s. barkhanus lineage. s. salmonicida genes with extremely high gc3s values were correlated with genomic regions with unusually high g+c content  <cit> . our data indicate that these genomic regions are less pronounced in the s. barkhanus genome.

sequence heterogeneity between s. barkhanus alleles
many s. barkhanus sequences show high identity within the dataset. for example, there are seven sequences annotated as alpha-tubulin. using a blastn e value cutoff of 1e- <dig> the  <dig>  unique sequences were divided into  <dig>  groups consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> sequences.  <dig> of these consisted of two or more sequences . this indicates that s. barkhanus encodes a large number of alleles and/or paralogs. manual inspection of clustered sequences revealed heterogeneity also between aligned est sequences indicating the occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms . one or more snps were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences, using the polybayes software  <cit>  . these results were surprising given that the genomic survey of s. salmonicida failed to indicate any allelic sequence variation  <cit> . there are several possible origins of the snps detected in the s. barkhanus dataset. they could represent alleles present within a single s. barkhanus lineage and/or alleles from different s. barkhanus lineages present in the grayling and maintained during  <dig> passages of in vitro culture. in principle, they could also be cloning artefacts produced during the preparation of the est library. we performed additional experiments and analyses to study the phenomenon in more detail and to distinguish between these alternatives.

the genes encoding enolase, ribosomal protein s <dig>  glutamate dehydrogenase, heat shock protein  <dig> and pyruvate kinase were selected for cloning experiments. all are single-copy genes in the g. intestinalis genome  <cit>  and show varying frequencies of snps in the s. barkhanus est sequences . primers were designed that amplified ~ <dig> bp regions in each gene from s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida genomic dna. the pcr products were cloned and between  <dig> and  <dig> individual clones were sequenced from each amplified region. the cloning experiments identified all but two of the  <dig> snps identified in the s. barkhanus ests with the polybayes software, all with the same variation . an additional ten snps not found in the s. barkhanus est data were identified in the cloning experiments . all were detected in multiple clones, except one only found in a single clone of heat shock protein  <dig>  the absence of these snps in the est data is likely due to poor coverage, possibly in combination with differential expression of alternative alleles. indeed, five of the novel snps were found in the glutamate dehydrogenase, a gene represented by very few est clones . these results strongly suggest that the variation in the est library corresponds to sequence variation present in the genomic dna, showing that the snps identified in the est data are not due to cloning artefacts.

a) sb: spironucleus barkhanus, ss: spironucleus salmonicida

b) major alleles are the minimal set of alleles observed in the pcr experiments to explain all snps present in the data.

c) no s. salmonicida ests were available for these two genes.

d) from two independent pcr reactions.

interestingly, the snps are not evenly distributed among the genes selected for the cloning experiments. four s. barkhanus genes have four or more snps, whereas none was found in the ribosomal protein s <dig> . the picture is similar in the est data; some s. barkhanus genes lack snps, whereas others have large numbers . this variation does not appear to be correlated with the expected level of conservation. for example, ribosomal protein l <dig> is present in several highly similar contigs in the est assembly, each containing snps, whereas ribosomal protein s <dig> only has a single allele . there are several plausible explanations for these observations. in principle, the sequence variation could originate from clonal s. barkhanus lineages present in the fish and then maintained in the culture. if so, the level of variation would be expected to be relatively evenly distributed among the genes with the most conserved genes showing the least variation. this does not seem to be the case . however, the observed pattern could originate from sexual recombination between two different lineages followed by autogamy that purges most of the allelic variation from each lineage, suggesting the presence of at least two lineages in the culture. yet another explanation is that the sequence variation represents allelic differences within a single clone, or very closely related lineages, of s. barkhanus. in this case the level of variation could vary considerably between genes due to recent local within-cell recombination that removes allelic variation. we tend to favour the latter model, mainly because it agrees with the patterns observed in the genomes of g. intestinalis gs  <cit> , and s. vortens . however, additional data is clearly needed to distinguish between the alternatives.

the degree of sequence variation differs between spironucleus species
comparison of sequences from individual clones from pcr reactions revealed between one and eleven alleles for the five amplified s. barkhanus genes , which is puzzling if they are assumed to come from a single lineage. closer examination of the occurrence of snps among the alleles showed that all snps often were represented in a subset of the alleles. for example, the thirteen snps in s. barkhanus pyruvate kinase were represented in three alleles. the other nine alleles are different combinations of these three major alleles .  <dig> of the  <dig> clones represent these major alleles . it could be that the minor alleles are artefacts of the cloning and sequencing procedure; chimeras are expected to occur in amplifications of closely related sequences  <cit> . using this rationale, the pcr experiments identified between one and five major alleles for the five cloned s. barkhanus genes . duplication of a segment in the s barkhanus genome, followed by divergence could result in more than four distinct sequences of alleles and paralogs, even if the organism is tetraploid.

ten snps were found in the s. salmonicida glutamate dehydrogenase gene, whereas none were found in any of the other four s. salmonicida genes in the cloning experiments . the presence of snps in glutamate dehydrogenase is probably due to a gene duplication followed by divergence; our preliminary assembly of ~4× coverage of the s. salmonicida genome indicates distinct upstream sequences for two paralogs . thus, our study indicates a low level of allelic sequence divergence in s. salmonicida, as suggested by the previous genomic survey  <cit> .

available sequences from the genome project of s. vortens  <cit>  were used to test whether allelic variation is present in this spironucleus species. sequences covering the homologous region of the five genes were identified among the > <dig>  genomic survey sequences  and > <dig>  est sequences available at the ncbi  <cit> . no sequences were found for glutamate dehydrogenase, whereas between five and  <dig> gsss, and between nine and hundreds of ests were found for the other four genes . the number of identified snps varied extensively between the four genes; none were found for the enolase gene, whereas more than  <dig> snps were present in the pyruvate kinase sequences . the number of alleles appeared to be high for the three genes for which snps were found . thus, extensive allelic sequence variation is present in s. vortens.

a) covering at least 80% of the region.

b) not available; no glutamate dehydrogenase sequences were detected in the released s. vortens sequences.

an emerging picture of allelic sequence variation in diplomonads
our data indicate large variations in the degree of allelic sequence variation between different genes and different member of the genus spironucleus. this is similar to the situation in g. intestinalis; wb  and gs  showed < <dig> % and  <dig> % variations, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, g. intestinalis genotype b isolates repeatedly show higher frequencies of double-peaks in sequence chromatograms from pcr amplifications from patient samples in epidemiological studies of giardia than genotype a isolates  <cit> . the allelic sequence divergence in g. intestinalis gs is non-randomly distributed along the chromosomes with large regions with very low frequencies of snps followed by large regions with high divergence  <cit> . similarly, some spironucleus genes lack snps, whereas others have large numbers .

in g. intestinalis gs most genes with snps seem to group into two, or sometimes three alleles  <cit> . our data suggest higher numbers of alleles for many of the s. barkhanus genes . ten proteins are represented by five or more closely related sequences which correspond to alleles and/or paralogs. an additional nine proteins with three or four highly similar contig sequences show allelic variation within individual clusters suggesting that also these have five or more alleles. a similar picture emerges from the limited analyses of s. vortens data . the genome project of s. vortens reported large difficulties with genome assembly  <cit> . total scaffold and contig lengths were  <dig> and  <dig> mb, respectively, which is much larger than the previously estimated genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . a probable cause of the problems is the presence of extensive allelic variation for a large part of the genome. local gene duplications followed by divergence may also contribute to the high allelic numbers found in s. vortens and s. barkhanus. interestingly, the s. vortens genes with the highest number of snps in our study have the largest number of gsss , circumstantially suggesting duplications of these genes. comparative genome size estimates of s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida were performed to test whether the differences in allelic sequence variation were correlated with genome size variations .

divergent genome sizes of s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida
we studied the genome size using flow cytometry analysis of s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida cells with fluorescently labelled dna . the total amount of dna in each cell was compared to the amount of dna in g. intestinalis wb trophozoites, which has been estimated to have a haploid genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . exponentially growing giardia trophozoites display two peaks with cells in the g <dig> and g2/m phases of the cell cycle with ploidies of 4n and 8n, respectively. the majority of cells can be found in the g2/m phase  <cit> . the g <dig> peak corresponds to a total genome size of  <dig> mb  and the g2/m peak to a genome size of  <dig> mb  . s. barkhanus has two major peaks that correspond to total genome sizes of around  <dig> and  <dig> mb . this corresponds to a haploid genome size of ~ <dig> mb, if a cycling of ploidy between 4n and 8n is assumed. the major peaks of s. salmonicida are very close to the peaks of g. intestinalis, suggesting a haploid genome size around  <dig> mb for s. salmonicida .

we also studied the genome size using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . unfortunately, the chromosomes were poorly separated in our pfge experiments, preventing precise estimations of genome sizes using this method . nevertheless, our genome size determinations using flow cytometry show a large difference in haploid genome sizes between s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida. this suggests that genome sizes are dynamic within diplomonads and may differ considerably even between relatively closely related and morphological indistinguishable species.

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a comparative study of s. barkhanus and s. salmonicida, as a part of our ongoing project on comparative genomics in diplomonads. traits which distinguish these from other studied diplomonads were identified, such as the ability to incorporate selenocysteine into proteins. our results also indicate that the genome sizes differ drastically between the two morphologically indistinguishable spironucleus species. there are also differences in codon usages and the occurrence of allelic sequence variation. a large number of s. barkhanus genes have high frequencies of snps, whereas s. salmonicida genes show sequence homogeneity. the presence and absence of snps among genes and genomes are the results of interplay of mutations and recombinatory events within and between isolates. in g. intestinalis, the presence of meiotic sex has been suggested  <cit> , the nuclei have been suggested to meet in the cyst with the possibility of genetic exchange  <cit> , and exchange of genetic material between natural isolates has been described  <cit> . our data suggest that the outcome of these different putative processes may be rather different in closely related diplomonads. further studies are obviously needed to understand the importance of the various putative phenomena acting on diplomonad genomes. the observations in this study are in agreement with our studies of g. intestinalis genomes  <cit> . thus, large genomic differences between morphologically indistinguishable isolates are widespread among diplomonads.
