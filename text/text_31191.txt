BACKGROUND
microarray technology is a high-throughput method for studying the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. microarray data analysis is a multi-step procedure, and an overwhelming number of published methods exist for each step. most popular methods for analyzing affymetrix genechip microarray data include background correction, normalization and summarization steps. for example, rma  <cit>  uses a model-based background correction, quantile normalization, and median polish summarization. these methods result in a robust and easily interpreted measure of expression for each probe set on an array. subsequent tests for differential expression based on these methods have lower computing costs than probe level linear models.

a less widely used methodology incorporates probe information directly in the analysis for differential gene expression. for example, the affyplm package  <cit>  fits robust probe level linear models with fixed effects. an alternative is the probe level linear mixed model  introduced by chu et al.  <cit> . this model does not include a summarization step, but uses log <dig> probe intensities directly in the model for tests of differential expression. in addition, the model includes a probe-by-treatment interaction term which, when significant, may indicate cross hybridization  <cit> .

in this study, we explored probe response patterns in affymetrix rat genome genechip microarrays. we also examined possible causes of variation among probes within transcripts such as probe affinities, homologies, and probe overlap. we discuss the value of using probe information directly in statistical models when the goal is to test for differential gene expression. to further investigate observed inconsistencies in probe response patterns between treatments, we conducted a blastn search using the complementary sequences from affymetrix probe sets for selected genes.

RESULTS
in affymetrix arrays, all probes within a probe set should ideally estimate expression of the same gene. however, high levels of variation among probes, consistent across arrays, are often observed  <cit> . for example, the log <dig> probe intensities range from  <dig> to  <dig> in the probe set in the top row in figure  <dig> panel a. other probe sets in figure  <dig> have variation almost as extreme. further examination shows that each probe set has a distinct profile which is mostly consistent across replicates. as a result, the variance for a single probe across replicates is an order of magnitude smaller than variance between probes within a replicate. therefore, probe is usually included as a fixed effect in probe level linear mixed models. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the probe response pattern frequently varies considerably between treatments. this phenomenon is most obvious for hsbp <dig>  in figure  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  which shows probe patterns for the top  <dig> down-regulated genes, gives more examples. this phenomenon is modeled through inclusion of a probe by treatment interaction in the pllmm  <cit> .

an effort to understand the sources of variability among probes within the probe set for each transcript is an area of much research. it has been suggested that some of the variation between probes for the same transcript can be explained by affinities, or position dependent base effects  <cit> . for example, figures 2b, 2c, and 2d show the effect of the middle base pair in the probe sequence on log <dig> intensity at the gross array level. however, in this study, differences in probe affinities within transcripts, calculated using the gcrma package  <cit> , accounted for only a small proportion of the total observed variation in probe intensities . figures 2a and 2d also show a subtle increasing trend by probe number at the array level . this is consistent with the fact that probe intensities are expected to be systematically lower at the 5' end of the probe set compared to the 3' end  <cit> . however, as with affinities, this phenomenon accounts for only a small proportion of total variation in probe intensities at the gene level .

affinities are constant within a probe sequence, since they depend on the bases that make up a probe sequence. however, in some probe sets, the probe profile is consistent across replicates but not across treatments. for example the probe numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for gene heat shock  <dig> kda protein  <dig>  hspb <dig> , in the first row of figure 1b display no treatment effect, while probe numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show extremely large treatment effects. a mixed model analysis along the lines of chu et al.  <cit>  confirms a statistically significant probe-by-treatment interaction for this gene.

probe-by-treatment interactions can be due to cross hybridization  <cit> . the reason for this is as follows: since each  <dig> mer probe sequence in a probe set has a different sequence , partial homologies for each probe in a probe set will also be different. therefore cross-hybridizing probes within a probe sequence will cross-hybridize to different sequences. therefore if the signal due to cross-hybridization is large relative to the signal due to the target sequence of interest, the way in which these probes respond to treatment will be different according to the different sequences with which they are cross-hybridizing.

to investigate possible causes of cross hybridization, a blast nucleotide search was conducted using the complementary sequences from the affymetrix probe sets for  <dig> selected genes; the search was restricted to the organism rattus norvegicus. table  <dig> shows results for  <dig> of the selected genes. this search revealed that the sequences of  <dig> probes in the top up-regulated gene, hsbp <dig> , probe numbers  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  do not match perfectly with any sequence in the gene. further analysis using the adapt tool  <cit>  and refseq  <cit>  confirmed that the same  <dig> probes were missing . an adapt search of the same gene using ensembl  <cit>  shows a single non-matching probe . in comparison, similar blast and adapt searches for the top down-regulated gene, id <dig> , utilizing refseq or ensembl, showed all  <dig> probe sequences matched the target gene perfectly . none of the other probe sets investigated had probe sequences which did not match the target gene perfectly. dai et al.  <cit>  address several issues in affymetrix genechip arrays, including probes which do not match perfectly the target sequence of interest.

the blast search was restricted to organism rattus norvegicus, however there is some duplication due to presence of multiple entries in some databases used in blast. note that not all probes for hsbp <dig> match perfectly with the target gene.

if a probe sequence does not match the target sequence of interest, it will increase the signal due to cross hybridization relative to the signal due to hybridization to the target sequence of interest. the non-matching probe sequences for hsbp <dig>  may partly explain the unusually high probe-by-treatment interaction for this gene.

sequence similarity results from the blast search showed that almost all probe sequences had sequence similarities with alignment-length greater than  <dig> base pairs . in fact the "e" score in blast for alignment lengths of  <dig> bp was  <dig> , meaning that, on average,  <dig>  alignment lengths of  <dig> bp are to be expected by chance alone based on the search criteria and the number of sequences in the search database  <cit> . the e score for alignment lengths of  <dig> bp is  <dig>  these alignment-lengths are well within the range that can contribute to cross-hybridization  <cit> . thus, it is to be expected that with  <dig> mer probes for rat or human genomes, cross hybridization is a contributing factor and needs to be accounted for in any proposed statistical model. in fact, the probe design criteria used by stekel  <cit>  for  <dig> mer probes reject probes having sequence similarities with alignment lengths of  <dig> bp or greater. figure  <dig> shows histograms of partial sequence homologies and probe overlap for the  <dig> probes from the  <dig> selected genes from the blast search. the median number of partial sequence homologies for a probe in this group was  <dig>  and the first and third quartiles were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the results probably overestimate the actual number of partial hits due to redundancies in blast databases.

attempts by the authors to directly model log <dig> probe intensity as a function of cross hybridization using information solely based on the blast searches proved inconclusive. adjusted log <dig> pm probe intensity was modeled as a function of number of partial blast hits for a probe and pm probe affinities. the pm affinity term was significant as expected. the number of partial blast hits was not significant. we also modeled absolute deviation from average treatment effect as a function of number of partial blast hits. regulation  was also added as a factor for both models. the reason the results were inconclusive may be due to the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the cross hybridization process and the numbers of sequences from different non-target genes that can cross hybridize with a single probe. however, a free energy position dependent nearest neighbor  model based on pm sequences has been used to model log <dig> probe intensity as a function of gene specific hybridization, non specific hybridization, and background  <cit> . this model has the advantage that it does not rely on mismatch  probes to model cross hybridization. zhang et al.  <cit>  demonstrate that it is inappropriate to use the mismatch probe to model cross-hybridization of the corresponding perfect match probe, since the mechanism for cross-hybridization is different. the results show that the "model is able to explain most of the variations of probe signals in a probe set"  <cit> . however, as indicated by wu, carta, zhang  <cit> , even this model does not take into account all factors that contribute to probe intensity, such as rna secondary structure.

the pllmm models probe variation and treatment variation separately. therefore an advantage of the pllmm over summarization methods  is that it includes a probe-by-treatment interaction term which can indicate presence of cross hybridization  <cit> . also, since it includes probe as a fixed effect, it adjusts for differences among probes, regardless of their cause. the strong effect of cross hybridization on probe intensity has been demonstrated by zhang et al.  <cit> . in this data set, using the pllmm to analyze the list of top  <dig> up and down regulated genes supports this observation. nine of the  <dig> genes had p-values less than . <dig> for interaction, and  <dig> out of  <dig> had p values below . <dig> for interaction. furthermore, this finding is consistent with the blast search results discussed above. summary methods, such as rma, provide no mechanism for detecting this probe-treatment interaction. it is interesting that the gene with the highest up-regulated fold change, heat shock  <dig> kda protein  <dig>  hspb <dig>  , as determined by rma with mas background correction, also has by far the largest probe-treatment interaction, and that, as stated earlier, four of the probes in the probe set show no treatment effect.

for differentially expressed genes identified in microarray experiments, validation using other techniques, such as rt-pcr is required. however, there are often discrepancies between results obtained from microarray experiments and rt-pcr analysis. for example, rejeevan et al.  <cit>  were unable to achieve consistent validation using rt-pcr for genes showing less than a four-fold difference in a microarray experiment. recent studies have shown that agreement between microarray and rt-pcr results depends to some extent on the background, normalization and summarization methods used to calculate gene expression  <cit> . the potential for probe by treatment interactions in microarray experiments may also partially explain difficulty in validating results. the presence of variation among probes in probe sets, and inconsistency in probe response patterns between treatments suggests that care must be taken in designing primers for rt-pcr. carter et al.  <cit>  provide guidance for improving consistency of probe sequences across platforms.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide expression profiling with microarrays generates a tremendous amount of data. it is critical to develop acceptable tools and guidelines for data analysis. the signal intensity of probe sets for each gene should be related to the abundance of the transcript, which can be used to quantify the level of gene expression. however, this signal can be distorted due to many factors, including cross-hybridization. although, the inclusion of mismatch probes was an attempt to adjust for non-specific binding, it has now been established that the mechanism of cross hybridization is different for mismatch probes than for perfect match probes. we have demonstrated that tests for differential expression based on the most widely used summarization methods alone may be misleading, since they provide no means for examining this effect. we suggest that examination of probe level patterns and plmm analysis can be used to identify genes potentially affected by these issues. these genes should be investigated further in order to make appropriate conclusions regarding differential expression.
