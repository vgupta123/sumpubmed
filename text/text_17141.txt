BACKGROUND
an area of significant interest in orthopaedics and rehabilitation medicine is the effect of mechanical loading on bone formation and remodeling. mechanical stimulation plays an important role in determining bone mass and density in the adult skeleton, as well as susceptibility to conditions such as fractures or osteoporosis. it has long been observed that bone mass and mineral density can be altered at very specific sites of the skeleton in response to mechanical stimulation during exercise, as seen in increased size and cortical thickness of the arm bone from the dominant side in tennis players  <cit>  and the increased mineralization seen in the lumbar spine of weight lifters  <cit>  or in the heel bone of runners  <cit> . in general, increased exercise or muscular loading will increase bone mass  <cit>  or bone density  <cit> . in contrast, decreased loading will reduce osteogenic activity, as seen in the bones of test animals in space flight  <cit>  or of patients in prolonged bed rest  <cit> .

since wolff's observation in  <dig> that mechanical stress is a primary determinant in bone adaptation  <cit> , extensive studies have been performed to understand how bone responds to its mechanical environment. frost proposed a "mechanostat" theory  <cit>  in which the skeleton senses mechanical stimuli that are above a certain threshold and bone formation is activated. after cell-mediated bone remodeling, a feedback system resets this threshold. however, the exact mechanism by which this mechanostat converts biophysical force to a cellular response is unknown. various mechanisms have been proposed to involve hydrostatic pressure  <cit> , mechanical stretch  <cit> , fluid shear  <cit> , and others. the signals activated by these mechanisms have been postulated to act via mechanically sensitive ion channels  <cit> , the integrin-cytoskeleton pathway  <cit> , phospholipase c  <cit> , or g protein cascades  <cit>  to trigger a cellular response.

bone morphogenetic proteins  belong to the transforming growth factor-beta  family of secreted signaling molecules  <cit> . although previous studies have revealed much about the important role of bmps in skeletal patterning in embryogenesis, many of these studies were limited by two issues. first, since bmps are required for multiple aspects of organogenesis, loss of function mutations often produce animals with prenatal lethality due to pleiotropy  <cit> . second, multiple coexpressing bmps can produce functional redundancy and mask the effect of loss of function of a single bmp  <cit> .

previous null mutations identified at the short ear/bmp <dig> locus have shown that early condensation and growth of cartilage precursors in the ear, rib, and vertebra require bmps  <cit> . in  <dig>  a new bmp <dig> mutation causing unusually short ears in mice arose spontaneously at the jackson laboratory. to gain further insight into the role of bmp <dig> in skeletal development, these mice were used to identify the location of this novel bmp <dig> mutation and its effect on the processing and activity of bmp <dig> 

to further investigate the role of bmps in development, mice which were homozygous for this novel bmp <dig> mutation were generated. our findings indicate that the mutation disrupts the processing of the bmp <dig> peptide and may inactivate bmp <dig>  furthermore, these mutant mice displayed severe defects at specific skeletal structures that were even more severe than those of bmp <dig> null mutants. some of the skeletal defects were observed at sites of bone-muscle interaction. biomechanical studies show that mutant osteoblasts from these sites failed to respond appropriately to mechanical strain and may implicate bmps as the endogenous signals for bone formation in response to mechanical stimulation.

RESULTS
bmp <dig> cleavage mutation disrupts the proteolytic processing of the bmp <dig> protein
sequencing of this newly discovered bmp <dig> mutation revealed a correctly spliced bmp <dig> transcript with a g-to-a substitution at base  <dig> of the bmp <dig> coding region . this change destroys a taq <dig> site in the second exon , providing a simple assay for following the mutation in genetic crosses.

most tgf-β superfamily proteins are synthesized as larger precursors that are cleaved at an rxxr consensus site by proprotein convertase endoproteases to generate an n-terminal pro domain and a c-terminal signaling domain  <cit> . the g-to-a mutation changes the first arginine in the rxxr processing site of bmp <dig> to a glutamine . to test whether the arg311gln mutation disrupts bmp <dig> protein processing, we expressed the wild-type or mutant forms in cos- <dig> cells and analyzed conditioned media by western blot analysis with antibodies raised to the pro and mature regions of bmp <dig>  cells transfected with the wild-type construct produced bmp <dig> protein bands of ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda, consistent with the expected sizes of the cleaved bmp <dig> pro and mature domains . both antibodies also detected a minor protein band of ~ <dig> kda , suggesting that some secreted bmp <dig> protein was unprocessed. cells expressing mutant bmp <dig> produced only the unprocessed ~ <dig> kda protein form , confirming that the mutation in the rxxr site blocks normal proteolytic cleavage. we termed this mutation bmp5clv to denote the lesion at the cleavage site.

bmp5clv mutants exhibit an array of skeletal defects
mutations in the rxxr site of other tgf-β family members have inhibited the processing and activity of the corresponding protein  <cit> . such mutations also have acted as dominant-negative mutations that block the function of other coexpressed tgf-β members, presumably by sequestering them into inactive heterodimer complexes with the unprocessed mutant subunits  <cit> . mice heterozygous for the bmp5clv mutation showed mild skeletal defects not seen in wild-type or +/bmp5null mice, including reduction of the spinous process at the second thoracic vertebrae . such defects are consistent with a mild dominant-negative effect observed when the bmp5clv allele is present in single copy, consistent with the mode of action observed for similar mutations in other tgf-β members  <cit> .

we expect homozygosity for the mutation to further decrease the activity of bmp <dig> and increase the production of the non-processed bmp <dig> molecules that may inactivate other coexpressed bmps. to determine the effect of this mutation on homozygotes carrying this allele, we crossed heterozygous carriers of the bmp5clv mutation and generated viable bmp5clv/bmp5clv homozygotes, but at rates ~10-times lower than mendelian predictions . despite the increased prenatal lethality, some bmp5clv homozygotes survived with normal life spans and fertility. among these surviving homozygous bmp5clv mice, we noted more severe defects than those seen with age-controlled bmp5null homozygotes, including shorter external ears , loss of lesser horns of the hyoid , more misshapen xiphisternum and missing ribs , less calcification of thyroid cartilage , abnormal bony fusion , and reduced or absent processes on the sixth cervical , second thoracic , and lumbar vertebrae . the spectrum of phenotypes, and the consistent reduction rather than overgrowth of skeletal tissue, both suggest that the bmp5clvmutation leads to loss rather than gain of bmp <dig> activity.

bmp5clv mutants display a deficiency at a mechanosensitive site of the skeleton
an interesting new phenotype in bmp5clv mice is marked reduction or complete elimination of the deltoid crest on the humerus bone . the deltoid crest is a prominent bony ridge that is the insertion site for the deltoid muscle, and it normally forms in response to mechanical interaction between muscle and bone. in paralyzed animals or those exhibiting genetically defective muscle formation, the deltoid crest does not form  <cit> . in contrast, mutant animals showing abnormal increases in muscle mass develop bigger deltoid tuberosities  <cit> .

the deltoid muscle remained present in bmp5clv/bmp5clv mutants, suggesting that the deltoid crest defect was likely due to changes in the humerus bone. in situ hybridization showed bmp <dig> expression in the developing deltoid crest of the humerus , and coexpression of the bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> genes in similar regions . the coexpression of multiple bmps may explain why the deltoid crest is only mildly reduced in bmp5nullmice but completely eliminated in bmp5clv mice. the expression of multiple bmp genes at the deltoid crest and the defect of this structure in bmp5clv mutants suggest that bmp signaling is important at this mechanosensitive site.

bmp5clv mutation alters the response of deltoid crest osteoblasts to mechanical stimulation
the loss of a prominent muscle-induced skeletal feature in bmp5clv mice suggests that bmp signaling plays a key role in bone cells' response to mechanical activity. to test this hypothesis, we isolated osteoblasts from the deltoid tuberosity of 10-month-old wild-type and bmp5clv mice and subjected the cells to  <dig> hours of cyclic uniform radial strain in culture. the stretch regimen we applied  is similar to the mechanical stimulation known to induce cellular responses in cultured osteoblasts  <cit> . after 24-hour cyclic strain, control osteoblasts became spindle-shaped, showed elongation of cellular processes, and were largely oriented perpendicular to the radial strain field . in contrast, osteoblasts from the deltoid tuberosity of the bmp5clv mice displayed no significant changes in morphology or orientation after mechanical strain , suggesting that the defect in bmp signaling blocked normal response of bone cells to mechanical stimulation.

values displayed are means ± sd of independent measurements from individual cells  pooled from  <dig> experiments. p values between wild type and mutant data from the same cell type and time point are shown. wt = wild type, dt = deltoid tuberosity, ft = femur trochanter, dm = deltoid muscle, os = osteoblast, fib = fibroblast, ns = not significant.

osteoblasts cultured from an independent bone-muscle interaction site that does not show morphologic defects in bmp5clv mice responded normally to mechanical strain in vitro . the anatomic site-specificity of osteoblast response to mechanical stimuli in bmp5clv mice is consistent with the specificity of the skeletal defects seen at the tissue level of these mutants. furthermore, muscle fibroblasts isolated from the deltoid of both wild-type and bmp5clv mice showed normal changes in morphology and orientation after mechanical stimulation in vitro , suggesting that the mutation primarily affects bone cells and not muscle cells at these sites.

to further characterize the relationship between mechanical stimulation and bmp signaling, we studied the effect of mechanical strain on cellular translocation of smad proteins, key transcription factors that translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon activation of bmp receptors  <cit> . non-strained wild-type deltoid tuberosity osteoblasts exhibited smad1/ <dig> immunoreactivity predominantly in the cytoplasm . within  <dig> minutes of applying cyclic strain to these cells, we detected a significant increase in nuclear localization of smad1/ <dig> . peak nuclear localization occurred  <dig> hour after mechanical stimulation, smad1/ <dig> was then predominantly cytoplasmic again by  <dig> hours , at which point cells also had reoriented perpendicularly to the strain axis. in contrast, smad1/ <dig> in bmp5clv deltoid tuberosity cells remained mostly cytoplasmic before and after cyclic stretch , demonstrating that perturbation of bmp signaling by the bmp5clv mutation disrupts bone cells' rapid response to mechanical stretch.

while mutant osteoblasts from deltoid crest displayed altered response to mechanical stimuli, it was unclear whether this was due to an ongoing requirement for bmp-mediated signaling or abnormal cell development at the deltoid crest of bmp5clv mice. to distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the effect of transiently inhibiting bmp signaling in wild-type osteoblasts cultured with increasing concentrations of noggin, a secreted protein that binds bmp and inhibits its activity  <cit> . incubation of adult wild-type osteoblasts with noggin produced dose-dependent decreases in their reorientation response to mechanical stimulation , confirming that bmp signaling is important in maintaining the normal mechanical responses of osteoblasts at postnatal stages.

discussion
although the role of bmps in the formation of cartilage, bone, and other tissues during embryonic development is well-established, studies of their functions during postnatal development are complicated by both the requirement of bmp signaling for many developmental events  and the overlapping expression and roles of multiple bmps at particular sites . the spontaneous bmp5clvallele is a missense mutation at a site that encodes the consensus cleavage sequence of bmp <dig> and blocks the post-translational processing of the bmp <dig> protein. interestingly, this allele mimics a form of dominant-negative mutation that researchers have artificially induced in other tgf-β members and injected into frog or fish embryos  <cit>  or expressed in transgenic animals  <cit>  in attempts to inhibit endogenous activity. the processing-defective bmp5clv allele identified here may be able to inactivate multiple bmps but only at sites of endogenous bmp <dig> gene expression, providing a unique tool to uncover new functions of bmp genes during embryonic and postnatal development.

skeletal analyses show that the bmp5clv allele has a dominant negative effect. bmp5clv heterozygote animals show skeletal defects not seen in bmp5null heterozygotes, and bmp5clv homozygote animals have a worse phenotype compared to that of bmp5null mutants. interestingly, studies on others tgf-β members have also described a dominant negative phenomenon displayed by similar cleavage sequence mutants. in those studies, the non-processed mutant proteins exert their effect on coexpressed wild type proteins by sequestering them into inactive complexes  <cit> . it remains to be shown whether bmp5clv heterodimerizes with bmp <dig> or bmp <dig>  which are co-expressed at the deltoid crest. inactivation of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> by the mutant bmp <dig> protein may explain why the deltoid crest is only mildly reduced in bmp5null mice but severely reduced in bmp5clv mice.

while the skeletal analysis was performed in adult bmp5clv mutants, given the expression of bmp <dig> seen at the early embryonic stages of humeral development in our expression studies, it is possible that bmps exert their effect on this structure at an early developmental stage. it will be interesting to perform histological analysis at various development time points to better characterize the phenotype of this mutation at different stages of development.

the skeletal defects we observed in the bmp5clv mutants are localized to specific structures. interestingly, previous studies show that the expression of bmp <dig> is controlled by an array of cis-acting regulatory sequences that drive bmp <dig> expression at highly specific anatomical locations in the skeleton  <cit> . accordingly, the unique expression pattern of bmp <dig> may account for the specificity of skeletal defects seen in the bmp5clv mutants.

the deltoid tuberosity defect in bmp5clv mice suggests that the formation of a prominent muscle-induced bony structure in the humerus requires bmp signaling. our biomechanical studies confirm that bmp signaling is fundamental to the early response of bone cells to mechanical stimulation. while we have shown that osteoblasts respond to mechanical stimulation by increasing the nuclear translocation of smad1/ <dig>  others have also shown similar in vitro activation of bmp signaling with mechanical stimulation. previous studies have shown elevated bmp mrna levels in response to  <dig> hours of tensile stress applied to neonatal mouse calvaria  <cit>  or cyclic stress applied to cultured chick chondrocytes  <cit> . our results demonstrate smad translocation in normal osteoblasts in vitro within  <dig> minutes of mechanical stimulation and show that bmp5clv cells fail to undergo smad translocation or reorientation in response to similar mechanical strain. the altered response to mechanical loading in vitro and the lack of muscle-induced features in bmp5clv mice provide strong genetic evidence that bmp signaling is integral to the normal response of bone cells to mechanical strain. while our data show that this mutation has an impact on osteoblasts, it remains to be determined whether perturbation of bmp signaling has any effect on chondrocytes from the deltoid crest.

while mutant osteoblasts from deltoid crest displayed altered response to mechanical stimuli, it was unclear whether this was due to an ongoing requirement for bmp-mediated signaling or abnormal cell development at the deltoid crest of bmp5clv mice. the altered response of wildtype deltoid crest osteoblasts to mechanical strain when the bmp signaling pathway was blocked with noggin suggests that bmps are important in maintaining the ability of bone cells to respond to mechanical strain postnatally. it will be interesting to perform further biomechanical studies on bmp5clv osteoblasts in the presence of exogenous bmp <dig> protein to ascertain whether the bmp5clv mutation also affects the proper cell development of osteoblasts at the deltoid crest.

CONCLUSIONS
over the years, researchers have recognized that the mechanical response of bone strongly influences human health and disease. weight-bearing exercise can increase bone mass and density and can reduce the risk of fracture in millions of persons with predisposing factors including osteoporosis. numerous studies have provided a better understanding of the mechanical stimuli that bone cells detect, the signaling pathways that transduce mechanical signals to the cell, and the nature of the cellular response. this study on bmp5clv mice shows that bmp signaling is an important part of this mechanotransduction system in bone. further studies may elucidate how the bmp pathway interacts with other signaling pathways in this process. modulation of bmp signaling through recombinant protein or gene therapy may enable clinicians to potentiate the benefits of weight-bearing activity to the skeleton or improve the treatment of bony diseases caused by prolonged lack of mechanical stimulation.
