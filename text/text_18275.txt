BACKGROUND
genes that share a similar expression profile across multiple spatial, temporal, environmental and genetic conditions are likely to be under common transcriptional regulations. such sets of coexpressed genes could be considered eukaryotic regulons  <cit> . meta-analysis of microarray data, sometimes combined with other types of data – proteomics, co-precipitation, literature, yeast two hybrid – has proven valuable for model organisms including bacteria  <cit> , nematode  <cit> , human  <cit> , chimpanzee  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit>  and yeast  <cit> . the use of transcriptome data alone has allowed for identification of functionally coherent modules corresponding to major cellular processes in yeast  <cit>  and some of these modules might be important enough to be conserved across eukaryotic organisms  <cit> .

meta-analysis of the arabidopsis transcriptome thus offers the potential to identify prevailing cellular processes, to associate genes with particular biological processes, and to assign otherwise unknown genes to biological processes they are correlated with. despite the model plant arabidopsis genome having been fully sequenced since  <dig>  the function of many of its over  <dig>  protein-coding genes is experimentally undetermined. almost  <dig>  of the genes cannot be ascribed any function. many other genes contain a domain recognizable as representing a general molecular or biochemical function , but no clear physiological function; i.e., the nature of their involvement in cellular processes is not understood . the effort to assign the function to otherwise unknown genes that are correlated with genes of known function was recently undertaken by horan and coworkers  <cit> . the authors used the clustering of expression data to propose a function to  <dig> genes coding for proteins of unknown function  and set up a plant unknown-eome database   <cit> .

arabidopsis expression data is available across a wide range of perturbations of nutrients, stress, and light, in the framework of defined organs, genetic backgrounds, and developmental stages. with this wealth of data it is tempting to identify genes that share common expression signatures across a variety of experiments. thus, the arabidopsis transcriptome is receiving growing attention, despite the challenges associated with a high volume of genes, distribution of data across multiple databases and publications, and incompleteness of the biological data and metadata. several online repositories for microarray data and metadata storage and/or analysis have been created, including nascarrays  <cit> , genevestigator  <cit> , plexdb  <cit> , metaomgraph  <cit> , arrayexpress  <cit> , vanted  <cit> , virtualplant  <cit> , atted-ii  <cit> , arabidopsis coexpression data mining tools  <cit> , bio-array resource  <cit> , mapman  <cit> , pageman  <cit>  and cressexpress  <cit> . based on the data from public datasets, coexpression of genes in the indole, flavonoid and phenyl-propanoid biosynthetic pathways has been reported  <cit> . similarly, coexpression has been shown for genes encoding synthesis of cellulose and other cell wall components  <cit>  and oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . morcuende et al.  <cit>  used large-scale transcript data, along with metabolomic and enzymatic activity data, to investigate finer-tuned changes in arabidopsis regulatory networks during phosphate starvation. ma and bohnert  <cit>  and weston et al.  <cit>  classified characteristic transcriptome responses to stresses, using public microarray data. biehl et al.  <cit>  assigned  <dig> arabidopsis nuclear genes, mostly encoding plastid-localized proteins, to  <dig> regulons, based on rna accumulation profiles across  <dig> different conditions. wei et al.  <cit>  study of the transcriptional coordination of  <dig>  genes coding for enzymes in aracyc pathways  <cit>  indicated a broad transcriptional basis for coexpression of metabolic pathways. recently, ma et al.  <cit>  presented an arabidopsis gene coexpression network based on partial correlation analysis. with the random sampling of genes, the authors circumvented the computational problem resulting from small number of samples versus large number of genes and approximated direct associations between the genes, obtaining a network with  <dig> genes and  <dig>  interactions.

here, we present a global analysis of the regulon organization of the arabidopsis genome, derived from the results of the graph clustering of the coexpression network of the  <dig>  genes. the relationships among genes in a complex organism clearly entail shifts in alliances among the genes, resulting in "fuzzy" memberships  <cit>  in different clusters according to perturbations in environmental and genetic conditions. none-the-less, this analysis captures the prevailing transcriptional network of the organism. as such, it provides a strategy to evaluate functions of genes in a given gene family, and to develop experimentally testable hypotheses about the functions of genes with no known physiological or developmental role. the approach applied in this study delivers a perspective that is not constrained by existing assumptions about the organization of plant processes. instead, the organization emerges directly from observations. the analysis reveals biologically coherent functional modules, representing a sometimes surprising combination of metabolic and developmental genes.

RESULTS
graph-clustering of arabidopsis transcriptome data
to facilitate identification of the regulon organization of coexpressed arabidopsis genes that reflect the most prevailing processes in this plant, we performed meta-analysis of multiple microarray experiments. we developed a transcriptome data set for  <dig> experiments from the public microarray depositories nascarrays  <cit>  and plexdb  <cit>  . the experiments from these databases incorporate a wide variety of mutants, environmental conditions and stages of development. to avoid artifactual signals, samples and experiments with poor replicate quality were removed. the resulting  <dig> chips were normalized to the common range and the replicates were averaged to yield  <dig> samples. to further minimize noise in the data, probe sets with low expression values  were removed from analysis . in order to concentrate on the most prominent coexpressed sets, only genes correlated above pearson's correlation threshold of  <dig>  with at least two other genes were included in the analysis. the expression data for the resulting  <dig>  probe sets was treated as a coexpression network in which genes are represented as nodes, and two nodes are connected by an edge if the pearson correlation between their rna accumulation profiles is higher than a threshold of  <dig> .

pearson's r has been chosen as the similarity measure between the expression profiles, in spite of its known shortcoming – measuring the strength of only linear relationships and sensitivity to outliers. we estimate that the presence of strong non-linear relationships between gene expression profiles in expression data, which would not be picked up by pearson's r, is relatively rare. the results presented by daub et al.  <cit> , where authors found no increase in the discovery of high correlations in gene expression data when using measures of non-linear relationships  agree with this assertion. pearson correlation gives high score for the expression profiles which consist of mostly very low values and one, or few, very high values, which in our dataset often occurs for genes that are expressed only in couple of underrepresented tissues or conditions. this sensitivity to outliers is usually seen as the drawback of pearson's correlation measure. however, we decided that for the purpose of our analysis these outliers are valid, though extreme, datapoints and that clusters based on the presence of genes in only couple of samples do represent valid clusters. for the groups of genes with expression profiles that are variable and parallel across many diverse conditions, a hypothesis of common regulatory program acting upon participating genes is particularly plausible. for clusters that are active only under a small subset of conditions, there is less ground for a co-regulation assumption. however, such clusters may also reveal valuable information. for example, the subset of genes for increased growth in response to auxin and cytokinin upregulated only in cell cultures and tumors would be hard to pinpoint if not for meta-analysis. correlations based on extreme values would not be found with spearman rank correlation, kendall's tau or in logged data.

we aimed to identify sets of coexpressed genes, which are represented in our model as densely-connected regions of the network. a graph-clustering method based on flow simulation  was used to identify clusters in this network that correspond to the sets of coexpressed genes. this method, developed by van dongen  <cit> , has been used previously for clustering protein sequence data  <cit>  and for identifying modules in the yeast protein interaction network  <cit> . one of the advantages of markov clustering is that it is scalable to large graphs, unlike most other graph clustering algorithms, which are not applicable to graphs with more than  <dig> nodes. using mcl, we identified  <dig> clusters in the arabidopsis network, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> genes.

to evaluate the significance of the clustering results, we compared the overrepresentation of gene ontology  terms in the set of the  <dig> largest regulons  derived from markov clustering of the experimental data, with go terms overrepresentation of  <dig> randomly-obtained sets of clusters. for each randomly-obtained set, clusters were designated by permuting the gene locus ids, such that the sizes of the  <dig> clusters were preserved relative to the experimental data, but the genes assigned to each cluster changed . the best p-value for overrepresentation of go terms was recorded for each cluster in a set and averaged over all clusters. distribution of p-values for go terms in the randomly-obtained clusters was then compared to the respective value for the regulons derived from the experimental data . for each go terms category , the experimental dataset scores significantly better than any of the randomly-obtained sets . this analysis indicates that the concentration of similar go terms in the clusters derived from experimental data is not random, and thus these regulons might correspond to meaningful biological processes.

the markov clustering result was also compared with results obtained from another common method, k-means clustering, with the same number of clusters  as a parameter. the clusterings produced by mcl and k-means differed in the distribution of the cluster sizes, which might have influenced their scoring. the agreement between gene assignments to regulons by these two methods is  <dig>  . mcl clustering yielded somewhat better s scores for go terms overrepresentation than the k-means method . mcl clustering had also higher z-score for the total mutual information between the clustering and all the go terms describing the genes within the clustering .

the prevalent physiological or developmental functionality of each regulon containing over  <dig> genes  was examined in more detail; the results are summarized in table  <dig>  to assign functionality to a regulon, we combined the results from two independent methods, automatic analysis of enrichment of go terms and manual inspection of annotation supplemented by literature searches for each gene's annotation and function, as well as examination of the conditions under which the genes of the regulon are maximally expressed. most regulons are characterized by a mixture of molecular functions  that work together to achieve a common goal. this goal could be, for example, hormone-mediated development of floral organs accompanied by metabolic processes , or a defense response leading to synthesis of protective compounds . one cluster is almost exclusively devoted to proteolysis . although genes with low expression have been filtered out, the genes that predominate in three of the larger clusters  are annotated as "hypothetical", transposons", or "pseudogenes".

regulons with  <dig> or more genes are shown. annotations are postulated based on go terms supplemented with information from the published literature.

a simplified view of the coexpression network formed by  <dig> largest regulons is shown in figure  <dig>  a link between two regulons means that there are genes in one regulon that are correlated with genes in the second regulon. it is interesting to note the higher-order grouping of the regulons that predominantly contain genes with genetic information-related, photosynthetic/plastidic, and stress response functions.

six regulons are devoted to nuclear-encoded plastidic functions
six of the regulons with over  <dig> genes represent plastidic functions that are encoded predominantly by nuclear genes .

regulon  <dig>  the second biggest cluster, contains  <dig> mainly nuclear-encoded genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthesis  . nineteen genes are involved in the formation and development of plastid organelle: its biogenesis, organization, fission and relocation. an example of these genes is thylakoid formation  <dig> , required for thylakoid membrane organization  <cit> . transporters of sodium, calcium and other metals are represented. two hundreds and eighteen genes in regulon  <dig> have a photosynthesis-related activity. of these,  <dig> encode enzymes required for synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus metabolome . seventy five genes encode plastidic ribosome constituents and related functions. twenty genes from the calvin cycle,  <dig> genes from photorespiration,  <dig> genes representing a subset of plastidic glycolysis enzymes, and  <dig> genes involved in starch metabolism are also present, reflecting the coupling of these metabolic activities with the light reactions of photosynthesis. in addition, enzymes for plastidic metabolism of amino acids and nucleotides are represented.

regulon  <dig> contains a total of  <dig> plastid-encoded genes,  <dig> of which participate in the light reactions of photosynthesis. such coupling of plastid-encoded and nuclear-encoded genes for the light reactions might be achieved by nuclear-encoded proteins with tetratricopeptide  or pentatricopeptide  motifs, which are thought to be transcript-specific regulators of plastome expression  <cit> , and sigma factors for plastidic rna polymerase  <cit> . consistent with this concept,  <dig> genes in regulon  <dig> encode proteins with a tpr or ppr domain. one of these, hcf <dig>  has been reported to process the polycistronic chloroplast psbb-psbt-psbh-petb-petd operon coding for proteins of the photosystem ii and cytochrome b6/f complexes  <cit> ; both psbh and petb are members of regulon  <dig>  flu, another tpr containing protein in regulon  <dig>  is a negative regulator of chlorophyll synthesis  <cit> . five of the six nuclear-encoded sigma factors that modulate the specificity of plastidic rna polymerase are present in regulon  <dig> . the exception is the phylogenetically and functionally distinct sig <dig>  which has been reported to be important for stress response  <cit> ; sig <dig> is a member of regulon  <dig>  "plastid stress and circadian rhythm".

protein import is represented in regulon  <dig> by: hcf <dig>  a translocation pathway component that imports proteins into the thylakoid lumen  <cit> ; tic <dig> and toc <dig>  a transit sequence receptor required for import of proteins and essential for chloroplast biogenesis  <cit> ; and cpftsy and cao, chloroplast signal-recognition particle receptor proteins  <cit> . two hundred and three genes in regulon  <dig> have no known function. the expression of regulon  <dig> is high in light, and in every organ except roots.

expression of the plastidic genome is partitioned
the plastid-encoded genes are partitioned across five of the  <dig> regulons: regulon  <dig> , regulon  <dig> , regulon  <dig> , regulon  <dig>  and regulon  <dig> . in contrast to regulon  <dig>  with its mixture of nuclear and plastidic genes, the other four regulons contain exclusively plastid-encoded genes: regulon  <dig> contains genes for  <dig> ribosomal proteins and rna polymerases, seven photosystem-related proteins, and three "hypothetical" proteins . interestingly, the operon membership of genes does not necessarily conform to their regulon membership. for example, genes from the tri-cistronic operon, psaa-psab-rps <dig>  each belong to a different cluster , likewise, the genes from the accd operon are scattered among three clusters .

aerobic respiration is a major mitochondrial-related regulon
only a single regulon of over  <dig> genes  contains exclusively nuclear-encoded genes with a predominantly mitochondrial function. most genes of regulon  <dig> are involved in mitochondrial aerobic respiration . thirty-nine of these genes encode structural components of the electron transport chain and atp synthase, six encode tca cycle enzymes, two code for pyruvate dehydrogenase  and twelve are of unknown function. the four remaining genes encode the putative cytosolic galactose kinase gal <dig>  adenylate kinase, sigma f inhibition-like factor and a mitochondrial dicarboxylate/tricarboxylate carrier. fifty-one of the  <dig> proteins encoded by regulon  <dig> genes are experimentally demonstrated or predicted to have a mitochondrial localization. the expression is well correlated and highest in pollen.

a large subset of the genes involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis  is contained in regulon  <dig>  together with genes for protein synthesis in other cell components.

mitochondrial genes are integrated with nuclear genes
seven of the  <dig> regulons contain an amalgamation of genes from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. although mitochondrial genes predominate in three of these regulons: regulons  <dig> , regulon  <dig> , and regulon  <dig> , no regulon contains exclusively mitochondrial genes. this synchronization of expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is consistent with the recent report that mitochondrial functions require coexpression of genes from both genomes  <cit> .

of the genes in regulon  <dig>   <dig> represent respiration-related functions  . most of the other genes are annotated as hypothetical or unknown. eight are adjacent genes already reported to be co-transcribed   <cit> , however, other genes are from scattered regions of the mitochondrial chromosome. this observed coexpression of genes from different regions of the mitochondrial genome is consistent with experimental evidence that modulation of rna stability plays a major role in regulation of gene expression in this organelle  <cit> . the expression of regulon  <dig> is generally high and well-correlated, and is upregulated in seeds, male gametophytes, and during starvation.

control of nuclear function and information processing
sixteen regulons are enriched in genes with a genetic information-related function .

regulon  <dig> contains  <dig> genes, many with experimentally determined or predicted functions in the cell cycle . for example, twenty one genes are directly involved in mitosis, including cell division control proteins  and cell division cycle protein hbt, cyclins and other cyclin-dependent proteins. other nuclear functions represented include gene silencing, regulation of organ development, nuclear transport, rna processing and histones. regulatory and signaling genes include  <dig> transcription factors,  <dig> protein kinases,  <dig> signaling-related genes and  <dig> other regulatory proteins. the expression of regulon  <dig> is highest in the leaf apex.

regulon  <dig> provides an example of a set of genes involved in nuclear function, which is also associated with a specific developmental process . sixty-five out of  <dig> genes have some kind of nucleic acid-associated activity: transcription factors, splicing factors, chromatin remodeling, histone deacetylases, rna helicases, dna repair, rna processing. however, five genes in this cluster have been implicated in the regulation of flower development: at3g <dig>  hua <dig>  is an rna-binding protein which specifies stamen and carpel identities  <cit> ; at5g <dig>  acts as a repressor of the photoperiod pathway  <cit> ; at2g <dig>  regulates floral homeotic gene expression  <cit> ; at5g <dig>  controls flowering and floral organ identity by silencing nuclear genes  <cit> ; and at4g <dig>  is a negative regulator of the floral homeotic gene agamous  <cit> . no genes reported to be involved in other developmental processes are represented. rather surprisingly, the expression pattern of this cluster is relatively low and uniform.

defense responses
six regulons contain primarily genes involved in resistance to disease or a pathogen; each is characterized by a set of genes that appears to have a specialized function.

regulon  <dig>  includes genes involved mostly in a combination of signaling events and responses to pathogens . sixteen of the genes encode protein kinases, some experimentally linked to pathogen responses ;  <dig> other genes are involved in disease resistance, response and signaling . three genes are involved in mapkkk cascades: mpk <dig> , and mkk <dig> and mkk <dig> . twenty-three of the encoded proteins have a predicted location in the endomembrane system. at3g <dig>  is a nuclear protein that modulates transcription in chloroplasts  <cit>  and might coordinate the response of the plastidic genome to the pathogen with the nuclear one. expression is high in leaves, especially following perturbations by pathogens or during senescence.

glucosinolates provide a chemical defense against herbivores  <cit> . most of the  <dig> genes in regulon  <dig>  may participate in glucosinolate biosynthesis in chloroplasts. of the  <dig> genes annotated with biosynthetic functions, seven have demonstrated or putative involvement in glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> , six encode enzymes similar in sequence to those of leucine, homoserine, lysine or choline biosynthesis. enzymes currently annotated in tair by sequence evidence as being involved in leucine biosynthesis might be also active in the glucosinolate pathway, since those pathways have analogous chemical reactions  <cit> . a flavin-containing monooxygenase, an antioxidant involved in glucosinolate production from phenylalanine in rapeseed  <cit>  is also present in the regulon.

regulon  <dig> has  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which are annotated as disease resistance proteins . it also contains other genes involved in pathogen response, among them lectin and lectin kinases, genes related to apoptosis,  <dig> protein kinases, many of them receptors, and eight genes annotated as involved in signaling. eighteen genes are predicted to be integral membrane genes. the spiky expression of this cluster, highest in leaves, could be considered symptomatic of genes responding to environmental stimuli.

other regulons predominantly devoted to stress responses include heat shock response , stress-induced catabolism , and synthesis of protective compounds derived from shikimate .

tissue-specific regulons
only sixteen regulons are predominantly expressed in particular reproductive or vegetative structures .

genes expressed mainly in pollen are grouped in three clusters, regulons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  each having a different expression profile among the samples containing pollen. regulon  <dig> is almost exclusively expressed in pollen. regulon  <dig>  the biggest cluster, is composed of  <dig> genes . it is a very highly correlated cluster and also a very dense one, containing genes with the highest average number of neighbors  for each gene. regulon  <dig> contains genes involved in the regulation of the pollen development, spermatogenesis and pollen tube growth. many genes in regulon  <dig> have regulatory functions, and many in regulon  <dig> are associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and transport. our clustering confirms the separation of pollen transcriptome into early and late stages of pollen development, observed by honys and twell   <cit> , whose experiment contributes most of the pollen samples in our dataset. since the number of experiments using pollen tissue in our analysis was small, the temporal resolution of expression of pollen-specific genes may not be high.

in addition to pollen having its own complement of unusually expressed genes, other clusters  are highly upregulated in pollen but also in other tissues.

coexpression of neighboring genes
we noticed that the genes that are neighbors on a chromosome are often coexpressed. this phenomenon has also been observed by others using different approaches  <cit> . to quantify the extent of the coexpression, we calculated the number of groups of coexpressed neighbors. coexpressed neighbors are defined as nuclear genes in the same regulon whose locus ids differ by at most  <dig>  to eliminate the contribution of tandem gene duplications from this evaluation, arrays of tandem duplicates were removed.

there are  <dig> groups of coexpressed genes,  <dig> genes in total. this value is significantly larger than the number of groups of coexpressed genes from data in which genes are randomly reassigned to regulons . the groups of coexpressed adjacent genes range in size from two to six genes:  <dig> of the groups have only two genes and  <dig> have three genes .

we were able to take advantage of our assignments of genes to functionally coherent regulons to evaluate whether the phenomenon of coexpressed neighbors is associated with specific regulons or with regulons of particular functions or characteristics. the  <dig> genes groups of coexpressed neighbors are not members of regulons with any obvious common characteristic or function, nor are they associated with any of the three super-clusters of regulons in the network . also, the coexpressed neighboring genes are not enriched in any go term. thus, coexpressed neighbors don't seem to be associated with a particular function, either with respect to gene annotation or participation in particular regulons.

interestingly, the distribution of groups of coexpressed neighbors on the chromosomes is not uniform. domains of coexpressed neighbors are absent from large part of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  adjacent to the pericentromeric region, and very rare in the analogous area of chromosome  <dig> .

genes of unknown function
the unknown genes that co-cluster with genes of known function might be hypothesized to share that function with characterized genes. recently, horan et al.  <cit>  used the clustering of public expression data to assign function to genes coding for proteins of unknown function , defined as genes with a go term go: <dig> . this way authors have proposed a function to 277– <dig> pufs, depending on the significance threshold. of the  <dig> pufs assigned to clusters with the highest confidence in horan et al.,  <dig> are present in our  <dig> regulons. the highest number of those  <dig> pufs belong to regulon  <dig> ,  <dig> are present in regulon  <dig>  and  <dig> in regulon  <dig> .

in our analysis, the total of  <dig> pufs have been assigned to  <dig> larger regulons with at least  <dig> members. in  <dig> largest regulons there are  <dig> pufs,  <dig> pufs in only  <dig> largest regulons. pufs are approximately proportionally distributed and consist about 30% of regulons. thus, the functions most often assigned to pufs are that of regulon  <dig> , regulon  <dig>  and regulon  <dig> . the exceptions are regulons  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  from which pufs are entirely absent.

genes of extremes
we identified the genes with highly varied expression, little variation in expression, as well as those genes that had sub- or super- mean levels of expression, from the expression profiles of the  <dig>  probes in the arabidopsis ath <dig> chip using the same 963-chips dataset. to evaluate whether the genes with extremes in expression patterns have any particular characteristics, the functions of the  <dig> genes with the most varied expression, the steadiest expression and also those with the highest and lowest expression were assigned to functional classes based on tair and go annotations and manual curation .

genes with greatly shifting expression patterns across a wide variety of conditions might be considered candidates for responses of the plant to internal and/or external signals. we defined the genes with the most dramatically shifting expression profiles as  <dig> genes with the highest standard deviation of logged expression value. indeed,  <dig> of these  <dig> genes had annotation suggesting their involvement in signaling  . only a single metabolic function is included:  <dig> genes had a function related to lipid metabolism, lipid transport, or lipid degradation, possibly reflecting fluctuating requirements for energy and membrane synthesis. the endomembrane system is highly overrepresented .

genes with the steadiest expression were defined as the  <dig> genes with the lowest standard deviation of logged expression value. twenty-six of these genes are relatively highly expressed, having a mean level of expression greater than  <dig>  the group of most evenly expressed genes includes a conglomerate of metabolic, regulatory, and transport functions . there is a high proportion of "unknown" genes in this group ; possibly the steady level of expression of these genes would make it more difficult to ascertain their function.

a related result was obtained with a different approach, focused on responses in stress-related microarray experiments, applied by walther et al.  <cit> . the authors found that genes annotated as responding to the various stimuli were differentially expressed in the highest number of experiments, while those with unknown or house-keeping functions had the smallest breadth of response.

genes with the highest expression  include photosynthesis-related genes , and structural constituents of ribosomes  and other genes for protein biosynthesis and modification. together, these functions constitute 58% of annotations of genes expressed at the highest level .

the majority of the genes expressed at the lowest levels  are predominantly hypothetical genes, transposons and pseudogenes ; these are classes of genes for which no or little expression might be expected. twenty-three of the genes in low expression group have functional annotations, including nucleic acid-binding genes and disease resistance genes. because the expression for genes in this group does not exceed  <dig> for any chip, a significant component of the signal may be an artifact .

negatively correlated pairs of genes
these analyses also yield information about which gene pairs are negatively correlated. wei et al.  <cit>  noted that within the subset of  <dig> annotated metabolic genes, there are few negative correlations. interestingly, this paucity of negative correlations is also true when the genes other than metabolic  are examined. in our dataset, negative correlations are far less abundant than positive ones; the highest negative value in the dataset is - <dig> . this value for negative correlation may be an underestimate, since pearson correlation coefficient measures the amount of linear relationship, while negatively correlated genes appear to have reciprocal relationships. interestingly, in six out of the eight most negatively correlated pairs of genes, one or both genes are implicated in a regulatory function.

discussion
the picture of arabidopsis emerging from this study is that of a plant mainly occupied with gathering energy, reproduction and defense from a hostile environment. genes involved in photosynthesis and photosynthesis-related metabolic processes are highly expressed, and form the second largest regulon. several other regulons appear to mediate chloroplast development and aerobic respiration. developmental programs associated with reproduction account for the function of ten clusters and include pollen, flower, fruit, root, and embryo. maturing pollen-specific genes form the largest and the most highly correlated regulon, comprised of the  <dig> genes. response and signaling programs are diverse and abundant, reflecting the need in the realization of the genetic program for elasticity in response to changing conditions. thirteen of the  <dig> regulons with at least  <dig> gene members appear to mediate plant responses to external or internal stimuli. each of these response-related regulons contains a mixture of molecular functions: receptors, kinases, hormone signaling, and metabolic genes required for defense . response-related genes are also among the most variable with respect to expression level.

comparison with graphical gaussian model
the graphical gaussian model  presented by ma et al.  <cit>  is a network which contains only links that signify direct dependencies between genes. our purpose was a bit different – we wanted to see all the genes whose response in expression in various conditions is similar, irrelevant if the effect on them is direct or not, in order to learn the organization of the plant cell transcriptome. similarity of expression between connected genes is precisely the meaning of the link in our coexpression network. thus, with no restrictions for the associations to be direct, our network is much larger, containing  <dig>  genes connected by almost  <dig>  million links. a method for exhaustive comparison between these two networks would be problematic, because only  <dig> genes are shared between them, and because we analyze our network by partitioning it globally into densely interconnected subnetworks, while ma and coworkers query the local neighborhoods of the selected seed nodes.

however, generally, we observe that genes from our genetic information-related regulons are largely missing from the ggm network . on the other hand, genes from metabolism-related and organelle-encoded regulons are very well represented in ggm .

a network formed by genes for cellulose biosynthesis is one of the most characterized in arabidopsis  <cit> . both in our network and in the ggm network, the cellulose biosynthesis genes were partitioned into those specific to primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis. however, our regulon representing secondary cell wall  is more comprehensive, containing  <dig> genes, compared to  <dig> in persson et al.  <cit> , and  <dig> in ggm;  <dig> of those  <dig> genes have an annotation consistent with cell wall biosynthesis, including laccases and microtubule-associated proteins linked with this process  <cit> . the three primary cell wall biosynthesis genes  are part of the 12-gene regulon  which also includes drought and cold-responsive genes. drought and cell wall biosynthesis have been linked before, as the modulation of the rate of the cellulose biosynthesis provides a mechanism to cope with dehydration  <cit> . likewise, the  <dig> genes designated as "proteasome complex" in ggm are part of a bigger module in our network:  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes are present in regulon  <dig>  along with  <dig> other genes encoding proteasome subunits. on the other hand, most of the genes that form the local subnetwork related to cytokinin-mediated signaling in ggm are not present in our network. some of the subnetworks identified in ggm are further partitioned in our data into more specialized regulons. for example,  <dig> out of  <dig> chromatin-related genes belong to regulon  <dig> , while  <dig> belong to regulon  <dig> . similarly, flavonoid biosynthesis genes form regulon  <dig>  and regulon  <dig> .

implications for metabolic pathways modelling
our analysis reflects a clear dichotomy between the metabolic pathways of textbooks and the arabidopsis transcriptional network. by identifying genes that are co-regulated with particular metabolic fluxes, and experimentally evaluating the effect of these genes on these fluxes, the fundamental mechanisms underlying regulation of metabolism can be better understood. one fundamental question is the extent of the integration of regulatory, metabolic and structural genes within a regulon. genes for a number of metabolic pathways have been shown to be coexpressed , and pathway genes from the aracyc metabolic pathway database also have coexpressed regulatory genes  <cit> . in contrast, in a clustering of  <dig> nuclear-encoded genes for plastid-localized proteins, biehl et al.  <cit>  identified regulons that, with the exception of photosynthesis and plastid protein biosynthesis, were composed of genes with diverse pathway associations. the global clustering described herein places these observations in the context of the near-whole arabidopsis transcriptome. although our analysis of a correlation among the  <dig>  probes on the ath <dig> chip clearly reflects the co-occurrence of enzymes from metabolic pathways in regulons, the aggregation of single metabolic pathways into distinct regulons is surprisingly scarce. exclusively  metabolic regulons are: fatty acid synthesis , aerobic respiration , glucosinolate biosynthesis , lignin/lignan biosynthesis , flavonoid synthesis , and protein biosynthesis .

one possible explanation of why a given metabolic pathway may not form stand-alone regulons is that it is part of a biological program encompassing several concurrent and mutually dependent processes. thus, the clusters of enzymes found to be coexpressed by gachon et al.  <cit>  in their analysis of secondary metabolite pathway genes also are identified in our analyses, however, most are contained within regulons that combine regulatory functions with structural genes and related metabolic steps. for example, shikimate biosynthesis genes are part of regulon  <dig>  which contains genes involved in defense responses, including biosynthesis of protective compounds. similarly, genes from plastidic glycolysis and the calvin cycle cluster with other genes active in the chloroplast during photosynthesis .

in a few cases, such as sucrose biosynthesis, or glycolysis, metabolic pathways are dispersed across multiple regulons. metabolic pathway might not form a discrete regulon because of participating enzymes having multiple metabolic functions, e.g., enzymes of cytosolic glycolysis are utilized for respiration and for anapleurotic reactions  <cit> . a second possibility is that enzymes from the pathway may be under translational or post-translational regulation. finally, gene families may confound co-expression patterns, as multiple genes in a family may contribute under different conditions to a single enzyme.

regulation of expression of organellar genomes
our results agree with a body of experimental literature , which indicates that the expression of the  <dig> genes of the plastidic genome is not uniform and is apparently finely tuned by multiple levels of regulation. genes from the plastidic genome fall into five regulons of varied functions: regulon  <dig> ; regulon  <dig> ; regulon  <dig> ; and regulons  <dig> and  <dig> . in general, all genes from a given operon are in the same regulon, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of the plastid genome is a major determinant of transcript accumulation. however, in some cases, genes from a single operon are dispersed across multiple regulons. thus, this pattern of regulon organization is likely a reflection of two processes: accumulation of subsets of transcripts driven by distinct pep/nep promoter combinations, and modifications of transcript levels due to alternative rna processing, mediated by nuclear processing factors such as ppr proteins.

individual regulons may contain many levels of regulation, as exemplified by regulon  <dig>  which appears to participate in the building and function of the photosynthetic machinery and related metabolic processes. the two genomes that cooperate to meet this goal, nuclear, encoding the majority of the plastid-localized proteins, and plastidic,  <cit>  both are represented in regulon  <dig>  coordination of these two genomes requires anterograde  signaling mechanisms  as well as retrograde  signaling mechanisms   <cit> . since genes experimentally identified as participating in many aspects of anterograde and retrograde signaling are coexpressed in regulon  <dig>  we infer that a complex network may modulate photosynthesis-related activities in this regulon.

interestingly, of the  <dig> regulons, none contains genes from both organellar genomes . this suggests that coordination between these organelles may not be achieved by transcriptional co-regulation. furthermore, that all plastid-encoded genes, except those mobilized in regulon  <dig>  are grouped in regulons by themselves  underscores the independence this organelle has maintained hundreds of millions years after endosymbiosis.

relationships among the regulons
the grouping of regulons with information-related, stress response, and plastid-related functions in dense regions of the transcriptional network indicates that genes in these dense regions may participate in multiple related genetic programs that under some subsets of conditions are coexpressed. other studies have shown that stress response genes are not usually specific and react to several types of stress  <cit> . in contrast, some regulons are relatively isolated from the network, most notably, regulon  <dig>  fatty acid synthesis, and regulon  <dig>  containing mitochondrial genes. isolated regulons might contain genes that are committed to a discrete process that is carried out in relative independence from other cellular functions.

genes not included in the network
during the data preprocessing, we have filtered out genes with low expression and with no similarity to other genes . the genes that code for proteins located in mitochondrion or endomembrane, or involved in apoptosis or regulation of transcription, were among those with the least expression. many genes for membrane-located proteins, including transporters, had expression profiles unlike any other in the genome. both these low-expressed and unique-profile classes of genes were not used for network construction. although many of low-expressed genes are hypothetical and might not be transcribed , some of the hypothetical genes might be active, but in very specific cell types or temporal conditions and thus their expression or ests have never been detected. several well studied genes, for example regulators of flowering constans and fri, or myb-type transcription factor cpc, responsible for differentiation of the epidermal cells, are expressed at a very low level and were filtered out of our analysis. furthermore, genes with flat expression profiles might also have little representation in the network; only  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes with most steady expression profiles were incorporated into a cluster, while  <dig> were filtered out due to low similarity to any other gene. the profiles of regulatory genes may be flat because the activity of their products is often modulated by translational or post-transcriptional modification – addition of a phosphate group, induced conformation change, binding a cofactor or other subunit. because regulatory genes are among the most comprehensively studied and often helped to guide the designation of cluster function, their absence in clusters hinders the identification of developmental programs in our clustered data.

coexpression of neighboring genes
the coexpression of neighboring genes identified in this analysis is higher than expected by chance and cannot be explained by coexpression of tandem duplicates. this result is consistent with several reports, each applying different definitions of coexpressed neighbors and using various methodologies to identify such groups  <cit> . the small sizes of domains of coexpressed neighbors in our data also agree with reports that coexpression is a short distance effect in arabidopsis. several hypotheses have been raised to account for observed local coexpression, such as that the coexpressed neighbors reside in chromatin domains with open conformation  <cit> , have shared regulatory cis-elements  <cit> , or are organized into eukaryotic operons  <cit> . our analysis indicated an unusual distribution of coexpressed neighbors on chromosomes along with an absence of overrepresentation of any biological function in co-expressed neighbors; both these observations are in accordance with the hypothesis that chromatin structure is the key player in the local coexpression effect.

negative correlations
pairs of negatively correlated genes might merely reflect disjoint sets of conditions in which the two genes are active; alternatively, they might indicate a regulatory relationship. the fact that most of the stronger negative correlations observed in this analysis include regulatory proteins is consistent with a possible biological importance of negative correlations. in agreement with this interpretation, our analysis identifies negative regulations that have already been established experimentally. for example, at2g <dig> , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein, functions as a negative regulator of cell division and interacts with cycd3; <dig>  <cit> ; in our analysis, ick <dig> is negatively correlated with cycd3; <dig> . ick <dig> also negatively correlates with the cyclin-dependent protein kinases cyc2b and cyca2-similar, cell division control protein cdkb2; <dig> and other mitosis-related genes . in a second example, at1g <dig>  skp <dig>  a negative regulator of dna recombination  <cit> , is most negatively correlated with dna polymerase and tubulin-related genes .

whether a given negative correlation translates to a negative regulation must be experimentally evaluated. an example of a pair of genes that are highly negatively correlated  is at1g <dig>  and at5g <dig> . another example is at3g <dig>  and at4g <dig>  . a testable hypothesis of the later correlation is that this ubiquitin-specific protease may play a role in the turnover of the photosystem i reaction center protein associated with photodamage.

availability of the data
the regulons data have been incorporated in metaomgraph software for visualizing and analysis of large datasets within the metnet platform  <cit> . regulons can be downloaded as the gene sets. the user can view expression profiles of the regulons across all experiments, or in a subset of experiments, examine the gene contents of the regulons and calculate the values for the absolute and signed versions of pearson and spearman correlation between the genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis yields insight on the organization of plant transcriptome into concerted processes. the network provides an initial glimpse of the interactions among regulons in a broad biological context. moreover, this study has the potential of assigning function to un-annotated and partially annotated genes; nearly  <dig> genes of "unknown" molecular function have been assigned to a regulon. as such, it provides new, experimentally-testable hypotheses about the functions of genes. further analysis of functionally coherent regulons will enable refining the existing models of metabolic regulation, developmental and response programs, and intergenomic communication.
