BACKGROUND
post-translational modifications of histones play important roles in regulating dna activities and gene expressions in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in the nucleus, chromatin forms basic units called nucleosomes which constitute an octamer with eight different histone protein molecules and a 146bp dna wrapped around it  <cit> . each histone molecule has two tails which contain amino acid residues subject to a variety of modifications such as methylation, acetylation, phorsphorylation, and ubiquitination. such modifications can affect  the accessibility of the dna to rna polymerase during gene transcription and thus can activate or silence certain genes  <cit> . more importantly, some of such modifications  are stable during cell division and considered important epigenetic events. in the past few years, with the rapid progress in high throughput technologies such as microarray and massive parallel sequencing, many exciting new discoveries have been made on studying the genome-wide binding landscapes of different histone modification marks using chip-chip and chip-seq methods  <cit> . in these studies, researchers discovered the combination of different histone modifications mark different chromatin states which often correspond to different genomic annotations such as promoters and enhancers  <cit> . such observations have led to discoveries and predictions of many new regulatory sites on the genome  <cit> . in addition, the chip-chip and chip-seq technologies enable researchers to investigate the distribution of the histone marks  on the genome at a high resolution, which led to the discovery that the binding patterns of the proteins and histone marks over the genome are also highly informative in predicting genomic functions and annotations  <cit> . an interesting discovery along this line is the relationship between h3k4me <dig> binding patterns and tissue specific genes  <cit> .

h3k4me <dig>  is an important histone mark and has been shown to bind to both gene promoter regions and enhancer regions and its binding is often associated with gene activation. a recent study demonstrated that in human cd4+ t cell and neural tissue, h3k4me <dig> shows specific binding patterns on the tissue-specific genes in their transcribed regions  <cit> . in this study, the focus is on a 10kb range of dna covering 2kb upstream of the transcription starting site  and 8kb downstream of the tss for the genes. the h3k4me <dig> binding patterns over this range for all the genes are then extracted and k-means algorithm is applied to cluster these patterns into five groups. interestingly, a group distinct itself from others as this group not only shows a bimodal distribution around the tss, it also uniquely shows high binding quantities  over the 8kb downstream of the tss. genes in this group are then shown to be highly enriched with tissue specific genes.

however, the recent characterization of histone mark distribution on tissue specific genes was carried out in matured tissue cells, little is known about the dynamic change of histone modification during the cell differentiation and development, neither is it known that at what developmental stage the h3k4me <dig> marking is acquired. it is generally accepted that the histone modifications play an important role in the cell differentiation and tissue development  <cit> . here we are using the public available mouse h3k4me <dig> chip-seq data from different developmental stages of neural cells, namely embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells, and whole brain cells  <cit> , and try to address the question that if the same tissue-specific patterns of h3k4me <dig> present in the neural cells, and if so, how early it emerges and how it redistributes during the developmental process.

RESULTS
identify tissue specific genes in the whole brain tissue
k-means clustering of h3k4me <dig> binding in the ±10kb-extended tss region of brain dataset identified seven clusters each with distinctive h3k4me <dig> binding pattern in this region . among them, cluster  <dig> has a prolonged tail of h3k4me <dig> binding in the transcribed region. the feature of the prolonged tail of h3k4me <dig> binding in the transcribed region was shown by the previous study  <cit>  as the marks for tissue-specific genes. therefore, we focused on this cluster of genes for our study of tracing tissue-specific h3k4me <dig> marks in neural cell differentiation and neutral tissue development. however since the first stage of k-mean clustering is coarse, it was subject to refined clustering  to search for the gene subset with more uniformed h3k4me <dig> binding in this region. the further clustering identified one cluster of  <dig> genes with substantial h3k4me <dig> labeling in the transcribed region and a small peak of h3k4me <dig> upstream of tss . go enrichment analysis revealed that this cluster of genes are highly enriched neural functions such as transmission of nerve impulse  and synapse function . in addition, 55% of this gene set are phosphproteins, and participate in various neural system functions, such as synaptic transmission , cell-cell signaling , construct presynaptic membrane , etc. these results are consistent with the finding that heavy presence of h3k4me <dig> downstream of tss marks the tissue-specific genes, i.e., brain-specific genes in this case.

h3k4me <dig> distributions are dynamic over different stages of development
using the same k-means clustering setting, we further separated es and np datasets into different h3k4me <dig> binding patterns in the extended tss region . most of them match the binding profiles of brain tissue, but none of them  resembles cluster  <dig> of brain, which has an elevated h3k4me <dig> in the downstream of tss. the above identified 356-gene list overlaps significantly with es clusters  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , and with np clusters  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . es clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are enriched with processes and networks involved in nerve system development, such as signal transduction of camp , neurogenesis  and nerve impulse transmission  . after checking the average h3k4me <dig> binding profile in the extended tss region for those genes shared with 356-gene list , only the cluster  <dig> of es  shows h3k4me <dig> labeling downstream of tss , while both the np cluster  <dig>  and  <dig>  show significant h3k4me <dig> labeling downstream of tss . therefore, the tissue-specific mark is spreading to more genes as cells further differentiate into the neural progenitor stage. the np cluster  <dig> contains about half of the entire probeset, so further clustering using k-means was carried out, and it reveals a cluster of  <dig> genes exhibits heavy h3k4me <dig> labeling downstream of tss . interestingly, only  <dig> were found in the 356-gene list. it demonstrated that the h3k4me <dig> labeling is a progressive yet dynamic process as cells differentiate from embryonic stem cell through neural progenitor till the final matured brain tissue stage. there are groups of genes with constant h3k4me <dig> labeling, and groups of genes with h3k4me <dig> levels change throughout development.

acquisition of heavy downstream h3k4me <dig> presence during different stages
to confirm the above observation, we combined the three h3k4me <dig> tss binding profiles from es, np and wb data for the  <dig> genes, and performed a hierarchical clustering based on correlation of the binding pattern in this region. visually the results revealed clearly three distinct h3k4me <dig> labeling groups as the downstream presence of h3k4me <dig> of tss as the development of neural system proceeds from es through np to the mature brain stage . the principle component analysis  on the same data also confirmed that there exists three well-separated group of genes . group  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with constant h3k4me <dig> labeling from es through np to matured brain. this group has more diverse h3k4me <dig> binding features than the other two groups as shown in figure 5b. go enrichment analysis shows that this group is enriched with γ-secretase regulation of neuronal cell development and function  . group  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with minimal h3k4me <dig> labeling in es and np stage, but gets heavy h3k4me <dig> labeling in the matured brain tissue. this group is significantly enriched with cell adhesion of synaptic contact  , and the h3k4me <dig> binding feature is quite uniform as shown to form a tight cluster in figure 5b. group  <dig> is the largest one containing  <dig> genes with minimal h3k4me <dig> labeling in es stage, but gradually gains h3k4me <dig> labeling as the cells differentiate into np cells then mature as brain tissue. it is enriched with several neural transmitter signaling pathways, such as gnrh, melatonin, dopamine d <dig> receptor, β-adrenergic receptors signaling pathway, and participates in processes such as nerve impulse transmission  and multicellular organismal signaling   as well as synaptogenesis  . both groups  <dig> and  <dig> are highly enriched with genes involved in several neural degenerative and neurological diseases, such as alzheimer early onset, epilepsy, tobacco use disorder, schizophrenia, and brain dementia, while cluster  <dig> genes are the least enriched with such disease genes .

discussion
in this paper, we applied detailed clustering analysis on the h3k4me <dig> distribution patterns around the tss regions of genes in the whole genome. our analysis confirmed the previous report that heavy presence of h3k4me <dig> in the downstream of tss marks tissue specific genes. however, more importantly, we have shown that such patterns are not constant. instead, redistribution of h3k4me <dig> occurs dynamically in all stages of tissue development.

in addition, our results shed light on understanding the acquisition of tissue specificity during the developmental process. for the  <dig> brain tissue specific genes, their h3k4me <dig> distribution patterns around the tss regions over the three developmental stages can clearly be divided into three major groups. the go enrichment analysis of the three groups of genes indicates that a small portion of neural system-related development and functions was activated or prone to be activated as early as the embryonic stem cell stage, as shown by the h3k4me <dig> marks on a small group of genes, whereas most of the neural system-related functions were developed or scheduled to develop through the neural progenitor cell stage, as indicated by the h3k4me <dig> marks on a larger set of genes in the np stage. there is a group of genes acquired heavy h3k4me <dig> labeling downstream of tss only when the matured brain cell is formed, and consistently cell adhesion activity such as synapse contact formation become the dominate process. this h3k4me <dig> re-distribution pattern fits very well with the developmental process of neural system.

an interesting observation about these three groups is the gene involvement in neural degenerative and neurological diseases as well as mental disorders including alzheimer early onset, brain dementia, and schizophrenia. most of genes associated with these diseases are in the group  <dig>  or group  <dig> . in addition, go function analysis also suggests that groups  <dig> and  <dig> genes are more involved in essential neural functions such as transmission of nerve impulse and synaptic transmission while the group  <dig>  are more involved in developing and maintain synapse structures as a mature brain function. these observations imply that these disease-related genes are more involved in the essential neural tissue functions than in the advanced brain activities.

besides h3k4me <dig>  many other histone marks as well as epigenetic events such as dna-methylation are also involved and more insight about the differentiation process can be gained with more data available. in addition, the brain tissue data in this study is obtained from whole brain sample even though it is well known that different anatomical and functional regions of the brain have distinctive gene expression patterns and more refined analysis of region and function specific genes could be identified using similar approach as in this paper.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we investigated the process of the h3k4me <dig> mark redistribution during tissue specificity development for mouse brain tissue. our analysis confirmed the previous report that heavy labeling of h3k4me <dig> in the downstream of tss marks tissue specific genes. these genes are not only highly enriched with neural system functions and pathways, but also highly involved in cns diseases. furthermore, we have shown that such labeling can be acquired as early as the embryonic stem cell stage, and its distribution is dynamic throughout cell differentiation and tissue development. the distribution of h3k4me <dig> on neural function related genes follows three distinctive patterns: a group of genes contain constant heavy h3k4me <dig> marks in the gene body from es through np to matured brain tissue stage; another group of gene have little h3k4me <dig> marks until cells mature into brain cells; the majority of the genes acquired h3k4me <dig> marks in the np stage, and gain heavy labeling in the matured brain cell stage. go enrichment analysis also revealed corresponding go terms that fit in the scenario of each cell developmental stages.
