BACKGROUND
sorghum bicolor  moench is a warm season species known for its drought tolerance and adaptation to high temperature but is susceptible to adverse effects of low temperature  <cit> . sorghum originated in the semi-arid tropics and is generally sensitive to low-temperature stress and suffers cold injury when subjected to nonfreezing temperatures below 12–15 °c  <cit> . low-temperature-induced inhibition of germination and emergence in the field followed by stunted growth is a manifestation of cold susceptibility problem in sorghum  <cit> . the inability to germinate prevents seedling emergence, resulting in poor stands, and subsequent growth of seedlings is hampered by cool air temperatures  <cit> . field evaluations for cold tolerance require multi-environment or multi-year testing as presence of genotype x environment interactions complicates the interpretations  <cit> . growth chamber assays for germination or vigor testing have been used to discriminate weak lines before planting and have been useful in quantifying cold tolerance in sorghum lines  <cit> , but needs to be verified under field conditions as well  <cit> .

genetic variability for cold tolerance have been reported and identified within sorghum germplasm pools. sources of cold tolerance are landraces that have evolved in the temperate regions of china  <cit>  and have exhibited higher seedling emergence and improved seedling vigor under cool conditions compared to select us hybrids and elite inbreds  <cit> . dissecting the cold tolerance traits in these landraces would be highly beneficial to efforts of transferring tolerance traits into the elite germplasms by backcrossing. to identify the genome loci associated with cold tolerance, qtl studies for cold germinability and seedling vigor have been carried out  <cit> . molecular markers such as ssrs have been utilized for identification of qtls for cold tolerance. however, there is still scant information that will provide an understanding of cold response and tolerance in sorghum as compared to other warm season crops like rice.

as early-season cold tolerance is a complex trait, it is important to explore the overall dynamics of gene expression and transcriptome during cold stress to facilitate an understanding of response to cold stress. the effects of low temperature stress at the molecular level through genome-wide gene expression analysis were reported in other warm season cereal crops such as rice  <cit> , but have not been applied to sorghum. the use of advance genomic sequencing approach to examine tolerance mechanisms to cold stress in sorghum could facilitate better understanding of the molecular genetic basis and be an effective complement to enhance overall sorghum stress tolerance.

recently, the use of next generation sequencing approaches such as rnaseq technology was proven highly valuable in expanding molecular genetic studies as it could be applied simultaneously to generate the bi-allelic variant information. the large amounts of sequence information from next generation sequencing technologies can be annotated to examine the role of specific transcripts under abiotic stress. transcriptome profiling using sequencing technologies have been performed in sorghum under nitrogen stress, and osmotic stress  <cit>  and combined heat and drought stresses. these studies provided information on specific genes involved in defense mechanism against specific abiotic challenges. however, there is scarce information on transcriptome profiling for sorghum cold stress analysis and the identification of snps and variants that could regulate complex traits such as cold tolerance. the snps obtained from these studies could be further utilized in performing the qtl studies, facilitating to target the genic marker controlling the trait.

there is critical need to learn more about cold tolerance mechanism as new areas for sorghum cultivation in cooler northern latitudes are expanding. generating gene-specific snps between the cold tolerant and susceptible sorghum genotypes would help in targeting loci which influences the traits directly and will aid in expediting breeding for cold tolerance. the objectives of this study were  to determine variation/changes in gene expression between cold tolerant and sensitive sorghums,  to identify and validate genic snps between cold tolerant and sensitive and  to generate a new genetic resource of genic snps that can be used as markers for cold stress qtl studies.

RESULTS
variation for cold tolerance response of sorghum genotypes and transcriptome profiling approach
sorghum germplasm btx <dig> and hkz were previously selected based on the 72 h cold germ test, field emergence and seedling vigor . hkz genotype exhibited higher germination and greater than 60 % field stand under field conditions during cool early season sowing compared to btx <dig>  in terms of seedling growth, hkz displayed vigorous seedling growth as compared to btx <dig> at 7 days after sowing at 14 °c.fig.  <dig> description of btx <dig> and hkz germplasm and their differential response to cold stress



transcriptome profiling from whole seedlings was performed by quantifying the gene expression between the two germplasm under control conditions and cold stress separately . cdna libraries made from the total rna were sequenced using massively parallel technologies, and short reads  obtained were further processed for expression analysis and snp calling.

transcriptome analysis in response to cold stress in sorghum
the raw sequences were aligned to the sorghum reference genome v.  <dig>  using gmap resulting in approximately  <dig>  % coverage of the sorghum transcriptome. to compare differential expression patterns among four libraries , we normalized the tag distribution for gene expression level in each library to come up with an effective library size and subsequently extracted the differentially expressed transcripts using the criterion p value ≤ <dig>  and log <dig> fold-change ≥ <dig> using edger  <cit>  according to the user manual. this provided an empirical approach and eliminated the bias introduced by rna composition. for the four libraries developed, our comparative analysis showed that a range of 625– <dig> transcripts displayed significant change in expression based on abundance. specifically, the differential expression patterns among libraries revealed that about  <dig> transcripts showed significant changes for btx <dig> between  <dig> and 28 °c. for hongkezi, approximately  <dig> transcripts showed differential expression between  <dig> and 28 °c. when the two genotypes were compared at 14 °c,  <dig> degs were identified and approximately  <dig> degs were detected between the genotypes at 28 °c .table  <dig> numerical counts of genes with two-fold or > expression between the sorghum genotypes under normal and stress conditions at p-value of  <dig> , normal: 28 °c after 7 days and stress: 14 °c after 7 days

annotation and gene ontology of sorghum degs during cold stress
the differentially expressed genes were further compared with the annotated genes of the sorghum genome . the gene description, go annotations were retrieved for each of the degs and were used for downstream interpretation of datasets. differentially expressed genes were assigned to different go domains and about  <dig>  % expressed transcripts were not assigned to any of the categories .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes assigned to go domains



to streamline the analysis, the upregulated transcripts in hongkezi and btx <dig> at 14 °c were categorized to molecular and biological processes . approximately 8–11 % of the upregulated transcripts under cold stress were involved in the oxido-reducatse activity for hkz. about 4 % of the degs were annotated as transcripts with putative role in cold acclimation for hongkezi grown at 14 °c. meanwhile, only about 3 % of the transcripts in cold susceptible line exhibited changes in category for stress responsive genes.

comparative analysis of a subset of degs under normal and cold stress conditions
we explored the rnaseq results for previously reported genes related to temperature stress responses in sorghum and related cereal crops and use these as bases for establishing a subset of degs for further analysis . for example, the ap <dig> family transcription factors such as sb10g <dig>  and sb02g <dig>  showed relatively high abundance in hkz under cold stress treatment. notably, a transcription factor previously reported to be associated with cold-stress, ethylene responsive transcription factor  also exhibited high abundance in the tolerant genotype under cold stress. the general trend observed in this study indicated that transcripts which showed higher abundance under stress in tolerant line had relatively low abundance of transcripts under control condition.fig.  <dig> normalized fkpm values for the genes that were differentially regulated among genotypes for some genes of interest



however, we also found that a number of genes including the heat shock proteins/transcription factors showed low abundance in both susceptible and tolerant genotypes under cold stress compared to control condition. also, a number of genes involved in detoxification of xenobiotics like glutathione-s-transferase were observed to be abundant in susceptible genotype mainly under cold stress. specifically, in the sensitive genotype, sb01g <dig> similar to  and sb01g <dig> showed similar relative abundance under control condition but were upregulated under cold stress . likewise, genes for plant cytochromes were also differentially expressed between the genotypes studied here. sb06g <dig> , sb02g <dig>  were observed to be upregulated in hkz under stress, while sb02g <dig>  and sb05g <dig> exhibited higher relative abundance in btx <dig> under cold stress .

quantitative rt-pcr of select degs under cold stress
to confirm the gene expression profiling data obtained from rna-seq, we performed qrt-pcr analysis to evaluate the expression of five selected candidate genes . the gene specific primers used are listed in additional file  <dig>  for the five genes evaluated, the differential expression or qrt-pcr results agreed with rnaseq analysis which indicated that rnaseq results can be confirmed with qrt-pcr data. this aspect was explored primarily for technical validation of the rnaseq analysis.

identification and validation of gene based variants
we conducted further analysis of the rnaseq data through identification of biallelic variants between the two genotypes studied. the corresponding snps and insertion deletions  were identified by comparing the resulting variant calls to the custom reference genome sequence using the alpheus software  <cit>  with the parameters: variant allele frequency ≥10 %, variant unique reads ≥ <dig> and average base quality score ≥ <dig> in the given accession, and either no variant allele or any allele present in the other accession. the stringency was increased thereafter to limit the number of unique reads to four. from this analysis, the total number of snp plus indel variants identified was  <dig>  . to obtain an estimate of the genomic distribution of variation, we calculated that the average number of total variants in each chromosome was approximately  <dig> . the most number of variants were found in chromosome  <dig>  while the least was found in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  these results may be reflective of the number of genes annotated in each chromosome.fig.  <dig> distribution of number of variants on each of the sorghum chromsomes



we assessed a set of  <dig> snps using allele-specific assay chemistry/endpoint genotyping approach to validate the bioinformatics snp call  using btx <dig>  hkz and two other sorghum genotypes rtx <dig> and gaigaoliang . the two other sorghum genotypes, rtx <dig> and ggl were included at this point to assess if the variation can be verified in other sorghum germplasm.

initially, we evaluated three snps from each chromosome and specific primers compatible with kasp assay using primer <dig> . the selected  <dig> gene based snps and results of genotyping including the amino acid changes resulting from the snp variation between genotypes are described in additional file  <dig>  the rest of the  <dig> snps assayed for validation are given additional file  <dig>  ninety percent of the assays validated the bioinformatic allele calls between btx <dig> and hkz . genotype call for rtx <dig> and ggl indicated greater snp polymorphism between ggl and btx <dig>  than between rtx <dig> and btx <dig> .

development of an integrated database combining transcriptome profile and gene based snps
in this study we also organized the rna-seq data on expression profile and gene based snp information from the cold sensitive and cold tolerant sorghum genotypes to generate a searchable database . the beta version of the database consists of the snp information between two lines along with their features, expression of the cold stress  and annotations retrieved from phytozome for the transcripts . additionally we also included information on successful primers designed for the snps between the two contrasting genotypes . we integrated these different files using microsoft access to develop the proposed integrated database as a resource for sorghum cold stress genomics research. the database is available from cropping systems research laboratory, usda-ars, lubbock, tx, website .fig.  <dig> overview of the database for retrieving the information on cold tolerant and sensitive lines



discussion
advances in novel high-throughput sequencing technologies provide immense opportunities to explore the molecular basis of response to abiotic stress, especially resistance and signaling-associated genes in different species by either de novo assembly or direct mapping to reference genome, resulting in identification and analysis of global transcriptome  <cit> . previous expression studies on biotic and abiotic stress in sorghum using microarray and next-generation technologies have shown greater promise of understanding genome-wide expression patterns of genes in sorghum  <cit> . expression profiling of plant responses using next-generation sequencing  can be effective way for understanding genes and pathways associated with cold stress response and expression of tolerance for this specific stress in sorghum.

the genome size of sorghum is estimated to be  <dig> , <dig> base pairs, arranged into  <dig> chromosome pairs or 2n =  <dig> based on latest bioinformatics v <dig>  analysis . approximately  <dig>  protein coding transcripts were annotated from the whole genome sequence of sorghum . the current study provides ~77 % coverage of the sorghum transcriptome. this coverage is comparable to that reported by dugas  <cit>  and gelli  <cit> . it is assumed that the rest of the transcriptome was not covered due to rare transcript reads. further, it was shown before that the success of covering the entire transcriptome is affected by tools or software’s used for alignment, and on the technology or chemistry used for sequencing  <cit> .

majority of the differentially expressed transcripts under biological process category identified in cold tolerant line hkz were involved in the oxido-reductase activity, however only 3 % of this class of transcripts showed changes in the susceptible line, btx <dig>  . previous work have shown that oxidoreductases are involved in cold adaptation in rice  <cit> . these results indicates that cold acclimation transcripts found in other species such as rice are also differentially regulated in cold tolerant genotype hkz and could be important in the expression of overall cold tolerance displayed by this genotype.

in this study, we observed that expression of transcription factors  under cold stress followed a pattern of up-regulation in the cold stress plants of hkz as compared to btx <dig> . as an example, the relatively high abundance of transcription factors such as c-repeat binding factors , ethylene responsive transcription factors  from the apetala2/ethylene responsive factor  transcription factor family were upregulated in hkz. noteworthy is that the transcription factors belonging to the ap2/erf family are conservatively widespread in the plant kingdom  <cit> . these transcription factors have been extensively studied in arabidopsis and rice and were shown to be over-expressed under abiotic stress conditions including cold stress challenge  <cit> . members of the drebs/cbfs subfamily are rapidly induced in response to cold stress and, when over-expressed, improve tolerance to freezing  <cit> . transcription factors represent ideal targets for traditional or genetic engineering-assisted breeding of plants with specific traits related to stress tolerance. in particular, erf transcripts are among the most interesting tfs because they have been selected through evolution to regulate a series of stress-response pathways.

we also observed that sb06g <dig> , sb02g <dig> , annotated as plant cytochrome like transcripts were relatively abundant in the tolerant lines under cold stress indicating possible involvement in defense mechanism . plant cytochromes p450s catalyze oxidation of a wide range of chemical reactions by activating dioxygen  <cit>  and were reported to play an important role in response to stress  <cit> . p450s  are ubiquitously distributed and are involved in the biosynthesis of plant hormones and secondary metabolites, and cyps accumulate in response to cold stress  <cit> .

we also observed that sb03g <dig> gene was highly abundant in both genotypes under stress and sb03g <dig>  another heat shock transcription factor transcript was relatively abundant in the susceptible genotype only under stress . this relative abundance of hsfs and hsps under cold stress could suggest a mid-point involvement in cold stress response between multiple stress pathways similar to observations made by swindell et al.  <cit>  and indicate that hsfs could have other functional features apart from heat shock responses. a number of studies indicated that heat shock proteins  and transcription factors  are involved in cellular response to various forms of stress besides heat. in arabidopsis and other plant species, various hsps have been induced by low temperature  <cit> , osmotic stress  <cit> , and salinity stress  <cit> .

notably, the transcript encoding glutathione-s-transferase  were also abundant in btx <dig> under cold stress . glutathione s-transferases  have functions in detoxification of various xenobiotic compounds and oxygen radicals  <cit> . their roles in these biochemical pathways make them useful markers in the detection of stress in plant metabolism. an increased production of reactive oxygen species is a common consequence in plants under abiotic stresses, which usually damage cellular membranes and other cellular components resulting in oxidative stress and eventually cell death  <cit> . it is likely that a high abundance of gsts may protect sorghum cells from oxidative stress that is prominent in cold sensitive genotypes.

the whole genome identification of snps for a number of sorghum genotypes was performed previously using whole genome re-sequencing  <cit>  or radseq technology  <cit> . here we report that sequencing of transcriptome was useful in identification of a large number of genic snps. genic snps and variations in structural genes are important as they have been documented as underlying genetic basis for many important agronomic traits. as an example,variation underlying an actual qtl controlling cold tolerance in the form low temperature germinability in rice was identified to be due to variation in a transcript that cause tissue weakening that allows protrusion of coleoptile during germination  <cit> . the number of snps that distinguished the two contrasting sorghum genotypes studied here suggests the strong potential of genic-snps for use as genetic markers for qtl or genome wide association studies. we suggest that the use of genic snps could be advantageous over conventional markers ssrs, rflps and rapds for targeting the loci controlling the complex traits such as cold, drought or salt stress by directly pointing to specific genes. from sequencing cdna libraries of two contrasting parents we could identify ~ <dig>  snps that can aid in generating a new genetic resource for the sorghum community. the snps selected for validation indicated that the approach of sequencing cdna would be beneficial for generating new set of dna markers in sorghum. the snp markers developed between the two contrasting genotypes for cold tolerance could be beneficial for identifying qtls in early-season cold tolerance of sorghum.

the complex inheritance of abiotic-stress traits limits the genetic modification of plants based on a single gene to achieve satisfactory level of tolerance. therefore an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to different stresses is critical for manipulation of associated pathways that can enhance abiotic stress tolerance. here we showed that the information from transcriptome profiling can useful as basis for characterization of germplasm exhibiting cold tolerance traits.

CONCLUSIONS
identification of common deg transcripts between sorghum genotypes with contrasting stress tolerance would facilitate a better understanding of the genetic bases of cold tolerance. here, illumina rnaseq analysis demonstrated that gene transcripts involved in abiotic stress response, and defense mechanism were regulated in both tolerant and sensitive lines. transcripts with higher expression could be useful as a biomarker for selection of tolerant/sensitive genotypes under cold stress conditions. the degs from tolerant genotypes would be the potential candidates to study further for improving cold tolerance of sorghum and related cereals. finally, this study took advantage of the bi-allelic variation observed between the genotypes which were translated and validated into easy to use and accessible gene-based snp markers for downstream genetic analysis of cold stress tolerance in sorghum.
