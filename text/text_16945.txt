BACKGROUND
in medieval times, small animals were thought to be devoid of internal organs, their life being animated by a sort of magic or divine spirit. the first naturalist that clearly saw and reported the internal anatomy of an insect was the bolognese marcello malpighi, in  <dig>  among other organs, we ought to him the first astonishingly detailed description of the ovaries of the silkworm. at that time, the recently invented microscope was a key development for this change of observational scale, and soon others followed malpighi's path. this led to recognize the high morphological diversity of insect ovaries.

to put a bit of order in that diversity, in  <dig> a. brandt  <cit>  proposed a classification of insect ovaries into two categories, panoistic and meroistic. panoistic defining ovaries in which all oogonia are eventually transformed into oocytes, and meroistic defining ovaries whose oogonia can derive into both oocytes and nurse cells. a further refinement was proposed by j. gross in  <dig>  <cit> , who divided meroistic ovaries into polytrophic  and telotrophic .

the panoistic type predominates among less modified insects, whereas meroistic are most common in more modified species, which suggested that ovaries evolved from panoistic to meroistic  <cit> . studies facing the evolutionary transition from panoistic to meroistic have been largely based on morphological evidence. however, significant cues to reconstruct such a transition should be found at a molecular scale of observation. the problem is that insect molecular data is practically restricted to meroistic ovaries, and within this category, to considerably highly modified species, like the dipteran drosophila melanogaster and the lepidopteran bombyx mori  <cit> . if we aim at reconstructing the evolution from panoistic to meroistic ovaries, we should therefore gather data on the panoistic type at molecular level. the purpose of this work is contributing to this aim, using the cockroach blattella germanica.

b. germanica is a hemimetabolous insect with reproduction mainly regulated by juvenile hormone   <cit> . in this cockroach, only one batch of basal oocytes mature synchronously in each gonadotrophic cycle, and after oviposition the eggs are deposited into an egg case or ootheca, which is transported by the female during the entire embryo development. in our laboratory, the first gonadotrophic cycle of b. germanica lasts eight days, and during this period the basal oocyte grows exponentially, showing a pattern parallel to that of circulating jh  <cit> . during the first gonadotrophic cycle three oogenesis stages can be distinguished: pre-vitellogenesis , vitellogenesis  and choriogenesis . while pre-vitellogenic, the basal oocyte is preparing for growth, jh is synthesised at very low rates, vitellogenin  synthesis in the fat body is just starting, and the intercellular spaces in the follicle are narrow. during vitellogenesis, jh and vg show the highest rates of synthesis, basal oocytes grow exponentially, and the intercellular spaces in the follicle are large. choriogenesis is characterized by rapidly decreasing rates of jh and vg synthesis and by the formation of chorion layers, whereas the intercellular spaces in the follicle are narrow again  <cit> .

our general approach was to characterize at genomic level the main stages of oogenesis in the adult b. germanica, pre-vitellogenesis, vitellogenesis and choriogenesis. to begin with, we chose choriogenesis given that it is the most characteristic one and the best known stage in meroistic species  <cit> . to identify genes related to choriogenesis, a number of approaches could be potentially useful, namely differential display, cdna macro and microarray and subtractive hybridization. of these, suppression subtractive hybridization   <cit>  has been successfully used for studying genes specifically involved in particular processes of insect development, like morphogenesis  <cit>  and metamorphosis  <cit> , or to obtain genes specifically expressed under certain physiological conditions  <cit> . these favourable results led us to choose the ssh approach for our purposes.

RESULTS
general library statistics
in order to find genes expressed in the ovaries of adult b. germanica after the vitellogenic period , we constructed a ssh library. the tester library was prepared with post-vitellogenic ovaries from 6- to 7-day-old females with chorionated oocytes, whereas the driver library was prepared with vitellogenic ovaries from 3- to 4-day-old adult females. cdna sequencing from the ssh library resulted in  <dig> sequences,  <dig> of which were filtered as low quality reads or as ribosomal rna, polya+ tails or vector sequences.

to identify unique sequences from the resulting  <dig> useful ests, we carried out an assemble using the cap <dig> program against a database of  <dig>  gene sequences from a cdna library obtained from b. germanica adult ovary that had been generated in our laboratory. the ovarian cdna library permitted the identification of the rather short fragments resulting from rsai digestion during the ssh preparation. after assembling, the  <dig> ests were clustered into  <dig> unique sequences distributed into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets, where contigs consisted in at least one est coming from the ssh library together with a sequence of the cdna library . these  <dig> sequences were deposited in the embl gene bank database with accession numbers from  to , and  for yellow-g sequence.

the  <dig> ests resulting from assembling were compared against available databases in order to find similarities with known sequences. the ests were compared with non-redundant databases of all organisms, as well as of arthropods in particular. we carried out direct nucleotide comparison , followed by a dynamic translation comparison , and only matches with e-values lower than 10- <dig> were considered significant for labelling them as known genes. sequences with an e-value higher than 10- <dig>  were labelled as undescribed. in summary, we found that 44% sequences had counterpart genes known in other organisms  whereas 56% were undescribed. est length ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs  in the case of known genes , and from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in the group of undescribed sequences.

the geneious pro  <dig>  program was used to predict putative open reading frames  in the  <dig> ests classified as unique sequences. setting a minimal length of  <dig> bp and considering that the orf covers most of the sequence as premises, results indicated that  <dig> out of  <dig> ests contain a putative orf .

gene ontology analysis
gene ontology analysis of the  <dig> unique sequences was carried out using the goanna program for a general approach, and the flybase to classify them according to d. melanogaster labelling. sequences were classified into the three ontology categories: "molecular function", "biological process" and "cellular component" . in the category "molecular function", the most frequent activity was unknown , which represents proteins with no associated functions, followed by structural constituent of ribosome activity . the most frequent "biological process" was cellular metabolic process , followed by unknown . concerning the category "cellular component", ribosome and unknown were the most frequent activities .

expression patterns
in order to assess the efficiency and quality of the ssh results, the expression pattern of a selection of genes was investigated by quantitative real-time pcr . expression was studied in the ovary of adult females from emergence  to oviposition . ovaries on day  <dig> were further subdivided into four stages, depending on the degree of chorion formation:  <dig>  no signs of choriogenesis, with the apical pole of the basal oocyte showing the basement membrane very close to the follicular epithelium ; 7ec, early choriogenesis , with the basement membrane of the apical pole slightly pulled away from the follicle cells ; 7mc, mid choriogenesis , with the basement membrane of the apical pole showing a concavity ; 7lc, late choriogenesis , with the basement membrane of the apical pole showing a claviform aspect . the process from 7ec to lc lasts  <dig> h approximately <cit> .

sequences selected to assess the efficiency of the ssh library were: yellow-g, bg <dig>  bg <dig>  cuticular protein-like, follicle cell protein 3c, cathepsin-l and cg10407-pa-like. they represent known and undescribed sequences. yellow-g is homologous of yellow-g cg5717-pa of d. melanogaster, which has an important role in vitelline membrane cross-linking  <cit> . follicle cell protein 3c is homologous to follicle cell protein 3c cg4015-pa of d. melanogaster, which is involved in the formation of the vitelline membrane  <cit> . cathepsin-l is homologous to cathepsin-l described in the decapod crustacean penaeus monodon  and other arthropods, where it participates in egg yolk degradation  <cit> . cuticular protein-like has 26% identity with a hypothetical protein in the beetle tribolium castaneum  and 20% of identity with cuticular protein cpg <dig> isoform  <dig> of the aphid acyrthosiphon pisum . cg10407-pa-like has 48% identity with cg10407-pa of t. castaneum , which contains domains typical of odorant binding proteins and juvenile hormone binding proteins. among the undescribed sequences, we chose bg <dig> and bg <dig> because there are more than  <dig> ests of them in each contig, which suggests that the corresponding transcripts are particularly abundant in post-vitellogenic ovaries.

results  showed that the seven genes studied are expressed differentially during post-vitellogenesis, and all of them have maximal expression in some stage of choriogenesis. yellow-g and cuticular protein-like, are expressed very transiently during choriogenesis, and their maximum expression is 6- and 12-fold higher than that of b. germanica actin-5c , respectively. the mrna of follicle cell protein 3c appears in 3-day-old females, their levels increase slightly as basal oocyte matures, peak at mc, and suddenly decrease in lc. cathepsin-l and cg10407-pa-like mrnas are present during the entire gonadotrophic cycle, though with changing levels. cathepsin-l show low mrna levels in pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic ovaries, they peak on day  <dig>  just before the onset of choriogenesis, and then decrease progressively until lc. those of cg10407-pa-like are relatively high at the beginning of the cycle, decrease during vitellogenesis  and increase during post-vitellogenesis, peaking on ec stage.

bg <dig> and bg <dig>  which have no homologues in databases, are expressed transiently during choriogenesis, similarly as yellow-g and cuticular protein-like. bg <dig> expression is ca. 80-fold higher than that of bgactin-5c, and maximal mrna levels occur at mc and lc . the expression pattern of bg <dig> is slightly different; mrna levels increase progressively from ec to lc, where expression is ca. 100-fold higher than that of bgactin-5c .

localisation and function in the ovary
in order to assess whether bg <dig> and bg <dig> are specific from the ovary, we studied its expression by semiquantitative rt-pcr in different tissues of adult females. rna from muscle, midgut, epidermis, fat body, colleterial glands and ovaries from newly emerged females and 7-day-old females were included in the study. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of bg <dig> and bg <dig> is restricted to mature ovaries. furthermore, in situ hybridization studies showed that both genes are specifically expressed in the follicular cells cytoplasm of basal oocytes during choriogenesis . interestingly, neither the sub-basal oocytes nor the germarium were labelled, and optical sections of the basal oocyte showed that the ooplasm and the oocyte nucleus were also free of label. these spatial data and the temporal data afforded by expression studies strongly suggest that bg <dig> and bg <dig> are involved in the process of chorion formation.

finally, we also tried rnai experiments with the aim of assessing the specific functions of the post-vitellogenic genes found. methodology was developed for yellow-g, given that its role in vitelline membrane cross-linking in d. melanogaster  <cit>  suggested to us that rnai phenotypes would be readily recognized and serve as a reference for studies with other genes. we used different doses of yellow-g dsrna  and treated adult females of different ages , but we did not observe any phenotypic effect . we presume that the very transient expression of yellow-g  made impossible the completion of the sequential steps for rnai.

discussion
the suppression subtractive hybridization library
the ssh approach has proven to be efficient for isolating genes specifically expressed after vitellogenesis in the ovaries of b. germanica. we obtained sequences of  <dig> genes, which give us the first cues to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating the final stages of oogenesis in panoistic ovaries, choriogenesis in particular. the expression pattern of seven of these genes in the adult ovary revealed that the highest mrna levels generally occur after vitellogenesis , thus validating the ssh approach.

the ssh technique has been improved to equalize low and high abundant sequences, although a remarkable degree of redundancy has been found in three cases: the undescribed sequence bg <dig> , the cuticular protein-like  and the undescribed sequence bg <dig>  . in the case of bg <dig> and cuticular protein-like, the high number of reads could be correlated with very high mrna levels during choriogenesis . high expression levels during choriogenesis is typical of chorion genes localized in specific genome regions which are overreplicated in order to facilitate high transcription rates in a short time  <cit> .

sequences homologous to known genes
we have isolated  <dig> sequences  which are homologous to known gene sequences present in databases . among these  <dig> sequences, two proteins, namely follicle cell protein 3c and yellow-g, have been described as involved in insect eggshell formation  <cit> . in our expression studies , follicle cell protein 3c is expressed earlier than yellow-g, which suggests a function related to vitelline membrane formation. nevertheless, the sequence of follicle cell protein 3c does not look like a typical eggshell protein, but rather appears more compatible with a protein with intracellular functions  <cit> . yellow-g belongs to a gene family composed by  <dig> genes generally encoding secreted proteins related to royal jelly and restricted to insects  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, yellow-g is needed for proper egg formation, probably for catalyzing the cross-linking of eggshell layers  <cit> , functions that have been postulated also in ants  <cit> . the structural similarity and the expression pattern, suggest that yellow-g may participate in the cross-linking of inner or outer chorion layers in b. germanica.

we have also isolated four ribosomal proteins: l18a, l <dig>  l36e and l44e, which must be involved in translation and are obviously necessary for the synthesis of proteins in large amounts over a short period of time  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, the protein baiser is required for the secretion or removal of misfolded proteins during chorion formation and for the activity of maternal products in early embryogenesis  <cit> . concerning troponin, ono and ono  <cit>  identified it as a component of filaments in the sheath cells of the c. elegans ovary, being an essential regulator of cytoskeletal activity and playing also a role in ovarian contraction during ovulation. similar functions for these proteins could be postulated in late oogenesis of b. germanica.

other genes isolated in b. germanica, like cathepsin-l, ferritin  <dig> and cyclin b, may have significant roles during embryogenesis, as suggested by previous reports on homologous genes in other species. cathepsin-l is a cysteine proteinase belonging to papain family, which is expressed in lysosomes  <cit> . the role of cathepsin-l has been widely studied in mammals, where it is involved in oocyte development, ovulation and follicular atresia  <cit> . in arthropods, fagotto and colleagues  <cit>  reported that cathepsin-l is the major yolk cysteine proteinase, and that it is stored as a latent proenzyme in tick eggs, whereas nordin and colleagues  <cit>  described it as the major vitellin proteolytic enzyme in b. germanica. these reports suggest that cathepsin-l is more related with egg yolk metabolism than with oocyte development, although the expression pattern showing maximal mrna levels on day  <dig>  also suggests a function related with follicular epithelium degradation . another identified gene is that coding for ferritin  <dig>  ferritins are iron storage proteins that protect cells of free iron , but also made this metal readily available. in fishes, high levels of ferritin mrnas have been observed in the ovary  <cit> , but little is known about its specific role. georgieva and colleagues  <cit>  reported that ferritin messages and proteins are synthesized in the ovary, stored in the eggs and used by the developing embryo, although the function during oogenesis remains unclear. cyclin b, along with cyclin a and b <dig>  can form complexes with cyclin-dependent protein kinase  <dig>  they act as mitotic cyclins, which are needed for blocking dna re-replication and for promoting the onset of mitosis  <cit> . dalby and glover, reported that transcripts of cyclin b are expressed at the posterior pole of d. melanogaster oocytes at a late stage of oogenesis, being incorporated into the developing embryo  <cit> . according to these data, the isolation of cyclin b at the end of oogenesis in b. germanica suggest that it is a maternal gene product having a role in embryogenesis, for example in microtubule dynamics as demonstrated in the embryo of d. melanogaster  <cit> .

novel genes
from the ssh, we also isolated  <dig> ests which clustered in  <dig> unique sequences without homology to sequences in databases. the generally short length of cloned cdnas  derives from the construction procedure of the ssh library, in which the double stranded cdnas are digested with the enzyme rsai to ligate an adaptor for pcr amplification. apparently, this restriction site is very frequent in the genome  <cit> , thus promoting the formation of short fragments, which makes comparisons with databases more difficult. this circumstance can account for the relatively high percentage of undescribed sequences encountered. another reason for explaining this high percentage may be that some ests could correspond to 3' or 5' untranslated regions , which makes impossible the finding of homologues in protein databases.

however, it is likely that most of these undescribed sequences correspond to novel or orphan genes, in the sense of albà and castresana  <cit> . for example, bg <dig> and bg <dig>  in spite of having a sequence fragment long enough  to establish safe comparisons, have no homologues in databases. these two characteristic novel genes were taken as examples for studying not only the pattern of expression by qrt-pcr , but also for examining them in different tissues by rt-pcr  and for localizing their expression in the ovary by in situ hybridization . results indicated that both are specifically expressed after vitellogenesis in the cytoplasm of basal oocyte follicular cells, which strongly suggests that they play a role in chorion formation.

functional studies with rnai taking yellow-g as model were unsuccessful, in spite of the different doses and different ages tested . given that other genes have been successfully disrupted by rnai in the ovary of b. germanica  <cit> , we presume that negative results obtained here are due to the very transient expression of yellow-g, which do not permit the completion of the rnai steps that lead to transcript degradation. this might also occur with other genes from our ssh library which have similar transient pattern of expression, although systematic rnai experiments for all  <dig> undescribed sequences are currently being attempted in our laboratory.

in any case, these  <dig> novel sequences seem to be exclusive of panoistic ovaries, which points to the possibility that the molecular basis of choriogenesis in panoistic ovaries might be quite different from that of meroistic ones. indeed, our ssh library did not reveal any of the typical chorion genes belonging to chorion protein families a, b or c of moths; or vitelline membrane proteins , chorion proteins  or smaller chorion proteins of flies  <cit> . the fact that b. germanica package the eggs into an ootheca, could also account for the differences. comparative genomics may be an efficient approach to compare putative chorion genes in meroistic and panoistic ovaries, or to compare panoistic species which protect the eggs in an ootheca with those laying free eggs. this seems to be the fairest way to illuminate the mechanisms underlying the transition from one type to another.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the ssh approach was appropriate to identify ovarian genes specifically expressed at the end of vitellogenesis and involved in choriogenesis in b. germanica. we obtained sequences of  <dig> genes, 44% of which had homologues in other organisms, whereas 56% had no significant similarity to any of the database entries. for most of the 44% labelled genes, functions related to choriogenesis can be predicted. this is the case, for example, of yellow-g and follicle cell protein 3c, which are well described as involved in chorion formation in insect meroistic ovaries. the high percentage of undescribed genes and the clamorous absence of most typical chorion genes of meroistic ovaries available in databases suggest that molecular mechanisms underlying choriogenesis in panoistic ovaries are significantly different from those of meroistic ones.
