BACKGROUND
pax <dig> is a highly conserved transcription factor that contains two dna-binding domains, i.e., a paired domain  and a homeodomain. pax <dig> has been identified as an essential regulator for the development of the central nervous system , eyes, nose, pancreas and pituitary gland, mostly through study of the phenotypes of several mouse and rat lines that possess either a spontaneous or an artificial mutation in their pax <dig> gene. although pax <dig> heterozygous mutant mice/rats with a semi-dominant mutation are known as small eye  mutants and can be bred, their homozygous mutant embryos die soon after birth and exhibit severe phenotypes such as a lack of eyes and nose as well as brain malformation. one of the rat small eye strains, rsey <dig>  has a spontaneous single-base insertion in the coding region of pax <dig> that creates an abnormal stop codon downstream of the pd  <cit> . however, in western blot analysis using an antibody against the pd of pax <dig>  truncated pax <dig> protein was not detected in homozygous  embryos, although we detected truncated pax <dig> protein in e <dig>  sey/sey mice  <cit> . therefore, rsey2/rsey <dig> embryos are suitable models for analyzing the role of the pax <dig> transcription factor.

in the development of the mammalian brain, pax <dig> is expressed in specific spatiotemporal patterns. pax <dig> is expressed in proliferating neuroepithelial cells immediately prior to the onset of neurogenesis on embryonic day  <dig>  in rats  and is localized to the forebrain, hindbrain and spinal cord. pax <dig> regulates a variety of developmental events, including the patterning of the forebrain, hindbrain and spinal cord as well as subsequent neuronal specification, formation of neural circuits and neuronal migration  <cit> . furthermore, pax <dig> is involved in neurogenesis, i.e., the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells and production of neurons  <cit> , and also in the differentiation of astrocytes  <cit> . the multiple functions of pax <dig> are very likely exerted through the activation of its various downstream target genes.

we previously used dna microarray analysis to demonstrate that the brain-type fatty acid binding protein  gene is markedly down-regulated in both the forebrain and the hindbrain of e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> rats  and is required for the maintenance of proliferating neural stem cells in the developing rat cortex  <cit> . three other dna microarray studies comparing the developing telencephalon of the pax <dig> mutant mouse with that of the wild-type  identified other pax <dig> downstream genes such as mevf <dig>  <cit> , ctnnd <dig>   <cit> , starb <dig>  nfia, ap-2γ, neurod <dig>  ngn <dig>  tbr <dig>  bhlhb <dig> and the retinoic acid  signaling molecule rlbp <dig>  <cit> . recently, pax <dig> target genes were identified in the developing mouse neocortex using chip-chip analysis in combination with transcriptome analyses, revealing pax6-regulated transcriptional networks in the e <dig>  mouse cortex  <cit> . compared with these telencephalon data, less information exists on downstream genes of pax <dig> in the hindbrain, although pax <dig> is crucial in the development of hindbrain motor neurons, the cerebellum and the precerebellar nuclei  <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> and wt rats to comprehensively identify downstream genes of pax <dig> in the early stage of hindbrain development. we were able to select genes with significantly different expression using quadruplicate microarray data processed via two comparative analyses; we then confirmed the fold changes using quantitative rt-pcr. gene ontology analyses revealed that a number of the differentially expressed genes encode signaling molecules as well as transcription factors related to development. detailed analyses of the expression patterns of these downstream genes, including dbx <dig>  unc5h <dig> and cyp26b <dig>  as well as several hindbrain-specific markers unexpectedly revealed anteroposterior patterning defects in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain that may be related to altered expression of cyp26b <dig>  a retinoic acid -metabolizing enzyme.

RESULTS
comprehensive transcriptome analyses in e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> and wt rat hindbrains
we performed the microarray experiments using genechip rat expression set  <dig> , which contains about  <dig>  probe sets that are expected to cover almost all genes. the two methods of comprehensive transcriptome analyses are shown in additional file  <dig>  four sets of rsey2/rsey <dig> and wt 'target' samples were prepared from mrna independently extracted from  <dig> hindbrains of e <dig>  embryos and were subjected to comparison analyses using microarray suite . in parallel, raw data derived from eight absolute analyses per sub-chip by mas were exported to genespring, normalized, averaged and compared. ideally, each of the two fold-change values from both procedures should match.

all genes on the arrays were plotted on a logarithmic scale in figure 1a according to their normalized signal intensities in the hindbrain of e <dig>  wt  and rsey2/rsey <dig>  rat embryos using genespring. up- and down-regulated genes are indicated in red and green, respectively. the use of four replicates greatly improved erratic patterns in areas of low signal intensity, in which data were widely spread in each of these analyses . we did not exclude genes with the mas-absent  flag from subsequent analyses because some of the genes judged to be absent  in all samples, such as ncam <dig>  are known to have a low expression level and/or a restricted expression pattern in the e <dig>  hindbrain. for accurate selection of differentially expressed genes, we performed t-tests using the cross-gene error model for all genes instead of using the fold change threshold. the  <dig>  selected genes with p-values less than  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . the up- and down-regulated genes that had relatively smaller  changes  passed the t-test at middle and higher signal intensities , but were discarded at the lower signal intensity . thus, this strategy enabled us to identify up- and down-regulated genes regardless of expression levels and fold changes.

gene ontology analyses of pax <dig> downstream molecules
to categorize the differentially expressed genes, we performed gene ontology  analyses. go annotations were collected for the  <dig>  selected genes, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were assigned one or more go terms: cellular component , molecular function , and biological process , respectively . downstream molecules corresponding to most of the est probe sets were neither annotated nor included in the analyses. because the go terms provided by the go consortium are based on a hierarchical clustering, we chose the most suitable go term for each gene in order to simply sort them into the go categories shown in figure  <dig>  categorization by the go term cc revealed that 75/ <dig>  genes encoded membrane components . regarding the mf term, 41/ <dig>  and 12/ <dig>  genes coded for molecules related to signal transducer  and channel  activities, respectively. genes  sorted into the "signal transduction" category of the bp term  overlapped with the genes categorized as signal transducer and channel activities of the mf term. these results suggest that many downstream molecules of pax <dig> that are located in or near the membrane function as signal transducers  that regulate various signaling cascades. similarly, 23/ <dig>  of the gene products were found to localize in the nucleus , and 21/ <dig>  genes encoded transcription factors or dna binding molecules . as expected, 15/ <dig>  of these transcription factors or dna binding molecules were classified in the "development" category of the bp term . thus, the go analyses demonstrated that pax <dig> is involved in various signaling pathways where it regulates the expression of many receptors, receptor binding molecules, transporters and transcription factors.

confirmation of differential expression of downstream genes
next, we used quantitative rt-pcr  to confirm the expression levels of the differentially expressed genes identified in the microarray comparison analyses; q-pcr was performed using the primers listed in additional file  <dig>  the genes selected for q-pcr analysis are indicated by cyan, black, magenta and blue dots in figure 1b.

among the highly expressed genes , all of the genes with two-fold or greater down-regulation  showed a similar down-regulation in q-pcr . the fabp <dig> gene, which we have previously reported to be down-regulated in the e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> rat embryo  <cit> , showed more than 50-fold down-regulation in the hindbrain at e <dig>  . another probe set for est/fabp <dig>  located in the intronic sequence of the fabp <dig> gene, also indicated a relatively high level of down-regulation in the two comparative microarray analyses  . in addition, using q-pcr we were able to confirm an actual decrease in expression for  <dig> selected genes that exhibited less than 2-fold down-regulation in the microarray analyses . however, one  of three genes that were found to be up-regulated in the microarray exhibited down-regulation in the q-pcr analysis .

with respect to the selected genes that had a lower normalized intensity , the seven genes that were down-regulated in the microarray comparison were confirmed to be down-regulated by q-pcr, while two of four up-regulated genes were not amplified well . other ests for camk2n <dig>  hes <dig> and ctnnd <dig> exhibited similar down-regulation as shown in figure 3b, suggesting that the normalized intensity obtained from the quadruple array samples was reliable in down-regulated genes.

of the selected genes that had an exceptionally low normalized intensity , the three down-regulated genes est/gdf <dig>  est/cxcl <dig> and unc5h <dig>  which showed a similar fold change to that obtained with the probe set for intronic est/fabp <dig>  also exhibited down-regulation in the q-pcr analyses . on the other hand, of the two selected genes that were up-regulated in the microarray, one  was down-regulated on q-pcr and the other  could not be amplified . the comparative q-pcr analyses suggest that down-regulation was more accurately reflected than up-regulation in our microarray analyses.

in further analyses of pax <dig> downstream molecules, we focused on four down-regulated genes, fabp <dig>  dbx <dig>  cyp26b <dig> and unc5h <dig>  that demonstrated higher expression in the wild type, as confirmed by both microarray  and q-pcr .

expression patterns of pax <dig> and its downstream genes in e <dig>  hindbrain
whole mount in situ hybridization  was performed on e <dig>  embryos of three genotypes  to examine the localization of the mrna transcribed from four of the most down-regulated genes  as compared to pax <dig> transcripts and protein . although pax <dig> mrna was detected in the rsey2/rsey <dig> and rsey2/+ embryos in an expression pattern similar to that of wt embryos , the pax <dig> protein was undetectable in the rsey2/rsey <dig> embryo and seemed to be reduced in the rsey2/+ embryo as compared with wt ; this result was consistent with western blot results from a previous study  <cit> . in the wt embryo, expression patterns of fabp <dig> were quite similar to those of pax6; strong signal was observed in the hindbrain and, at week one, in the dorsal telencephalon, a part of the diencephalon, as well as the spinal cord . in the e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> embryo, expression of fabp <dig> disappeared , as previously reported for e <dig>  embryos  <cit> . moreover, the expression of fabp <dig> seemed to be entirely reduced in the rsey2/+ embryo as compared with the wt embryo , suggesting that the amount of pax <dig> protein is critical for the induction of the fabp <dig> gene.

dbx <dig>  which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed in interneuron progenitor cells in the hindbrain and shows reduced expression in the e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain  <cit> . as shown in figure 4d, dbx <dig> expression in the rsey2/+ embryo did not differ from that of the wt embryo at e <dig> . however, dbx <dig> expression in the rsey2/rsey <dig> embryo was greatly reduced, specifically in the diencephalon, hindbrain and spinal cord; these regions lack pax <dig> function, as indicated by the lack of pax <dig> protein in the rsey2/rsey <dig> embryo .

unc5h <dig> is a netrin- <dig> receptor that is initially expressed in neuronal progenitor cells in the ventral hindbrain  <cit> . unc5h <dig> mrna was detected in part of the forebrain as well as in the hindbrain and spinal cord in the e <dig>  wt embryo; the expression domain was dorsally widened in the caudal hindbrain and anterior spinal cord . unc5h <dig> expression was reduced in the rsey2/+ embryo and was entirely absent in the rsey2/rsey <dig> embryo .

cyp26b <dig> is an ra-catabolizing enzyme that regulates ra signaling by promoting its degradation  <cit> . cyp26b <dig> showed a rhombomere-specific expression pattern in the wt hindbrain , corroborating a previous report in mouse embryos  <cit> . cyp26b <dig> expression in the rsey2/+ embryo did not differ from that of the wt embryo, whereas it was decreased specifically in the caudal region of the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain .

the above results indicate that not only fabp <dig> and dbx <dig> but also unc5h <dig> and cyp26b <dig> are good candidates for pax <dig> downstream target molecules in the developing cns. to ascertain the detailed expression of these downstream genes in the e <dig>  hindbrain, we prepared 'open-book' samples of this tissue . double staining for dbx <dig> and pax <dig> demonstrated that expression of dbx <dig> in the interneuron progenitor domain along the anterior-posterior axis overlapped with pax <dig> in both wt and rsey2/+ hindbrains . dbx <dig> expression was dramatically reduced throughout the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain with the exception of r <dig> , in which pax <dig> was not expressed. unc5h <dig> expression disappeared in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain in the ventral neuron progenitor domains and in the dorsal part of r <dig>  where pax <dig> was not detected at e <dig>  . cyp26b <dig> expression was altered specifically in the dorsolateral region of r <dig> and r <dig> in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain . thus, we consider these three genes to be very promising candidates for downstream targets of pax <dig>  we performed further detailed analyses focusing on cyp26b <dig> because this gene product is involved in ra metabolism, which is an important element in the anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain.

abnormal development of posterior rhombomeres in the rsey2/rsey2
to explore the rhombomere-specific alteration of cyp26b <dig> expression, several markers were examined by double-color wish in e <dig>  wt, rsey2/+ and rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrains . hoxb <dig> expression in r <dig> did not show any change in the three genotypes , suggesting that r <dig> was intact. krox <dig> expression was observed in r <dig> at this stage in the rat embryo . in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain, this krox20-positive r <dig> region seemed to expand along the anteroposterior axis . a similar change in r <dig> morphology was also detected in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain using a probe for epha <dig>  which was expressed in r <dig> and r <dig> . r <dig> was found to be intact in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain through the use of an ephrinb <dig> probe .

because the cyp26b <dig> enzyme metabolizes ra, we investigated the expression of retinoic acid receptor β, a gene transcriptionally induced by ra  <cit> . we expected that down-regulation of cyp26b <dig> in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain might induce up-regulation of rarβ in r <dig> and/or an anterior shift of rarβ to r5/ <dig>  although we did not detect a significant increase in rarβ expression in our microarray analyses , our in situ analyses revealed a relatively intense signal for rarβ mrna  with no obvious anterior shift . these results suggest that loss of pax <dig> function might have resulted in slightly abnormal ra signaling, which, in turn, might cause defects in the anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain.

discussion
advantages of our comparative microarray analyses
we performed comprehensive transcriptional profiling analyses to search for downstream genes regulated by the pax <dig> transcription factor in the e <dig>  hindbrain of wt and rsey2/rsey <dig> embryos using commercial high-density oligonucleotide arrays. after collecting four pools of  <dig> hindbrains dissected from e <dig>  rat embryos of each genotype, we prepared four sets of cdna pools for comparative microarray analyses. the advantages of our "pooled method" are:  the minimization of individual differences in embryonic stage, size and gene expression level and  the isolation of a sufficient amount of rna for microarray analyses without unnatural amplification, even from small embryos. we believe that this "pooled method," although laborious, significantly improves the acquisition of reliable microarray data. furthermore, comparison analyses of quadruplicate samples using two computational methods allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes that have relatively small fold changes, such as camk2n <dig>  hes <dig> and ctnnd <dig> , or low expression levels, such as gdf <dig> and cxcl <dig> . confidence, as shown by color strength in figure  <dig>  indicates that the selected genes with a relatively lower fold change were also considered reliably identified in our microarray analyses.

we have succeeded in minimizing false positive/negative candidates for differentially expressed genes, especially with respect to down-regulated genes. all down-regulated genes showed a similar trend in two comparative microarray analyses and q-pcr . only two of  <dig> tested genes exhibited expression levels in q-pcr that were inconsistent with their signal intensities from the microarray analyses. we could not perform q-pcr for the three genes whose signal intensities were less than  <dig> . these five genes were up-regulated in the microarray analyses. one reason for this difference is that we designed primers for q-pcr based on full-length mrna sequences or ensembl/n-scan/genscan prediction and not on the same est sequences used for the probe sets. transcription of est domains and full-length mrna as well as amputation/digestion of mrna after transcription might be differentially regulated. the other reason for this difference might be the developmental stage of our samples. we used e <dig>  rat hindbrains  in order to look for downstream genes that are directly regulated by pax <dig>  this stage occurs only  <dig> h after the onset of pax <dig> expression. therefore, down-regulated expression in rsey2/rsey <dig> is reproducible whereas up-regulated expression, which may be indirect, is not. reflecting on previous results from the microarray analyses of sey/sey mice, duparc et al.  <cit>  analyzed e <dig>  pax6lacz/lacz mouse forebrain and showed far fewer up-regulated genes as compared with down-regulated genes in a scatter plot. other profiling analyses, in which embryos at later stages were used, have reported a larger number of up-regulated genes in sey/sey mouse telencephalon  <cit> . this finding might be attributable to the indirect regulation of an increasing number of genes by signal pathway molecules and/or transcription factors that are downstream of pax <dig> at later stages of development, after the initiation of pax <dig> expression. in our analyses using e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain, we obtained a slightly larger number of up-regulated genes  as compared with down-regulated genes , although the number of up-regulated genes with high signal intensities  was smaller than that of down-regulated genes  . this result also implies the delicacy of the molecular networks that lie downstream of pax <dig> because the onset of pax <dig> expression in the hindbrain occurs slightly earlier than in the forebrain.

during the course of our study, we identified multiple probe sets on the rae <dig> array that recognized different sequences of the same genes and exhibited widely different signal intensities; these included the probe sets for fabp <dig>  unc5h <dig>  cyp26b <dig>  camk2n <dig>  hes <dig> and ctnnd <dig> . the variability in signal intensity among multiple probe sets may be due to  splicing variants,  different gene names and  ests that had not been integrated into the corresponding mrna within the rat unigene database, which was used for designing the probe sets. we used poly+ rna, not total rna, as a template, which might have resulted in a discrepancy in the signal intensities of different probes that were designed to recognize 3' or 5' sites of relatively long genes.

downstream factors of pax <dig> clarified by go analyses
we performed go analyses to elucidate the overall features of the molecules downstream of pax <dig>  the go analyses shown in figure  <dig> revealed that various signaling molecules were located downstream of pax <dig>  the large quantity of information from the go analyses enabled us to search for interesting features of the downstream factors of pax <dig>  for example, we found transcriptional changes in sst, ceacam <dig>  cspg <dig>  ascl <dig>  unc5h <dig>  nrg <dig> and thy <dig>  which are categorized in the "cell migration" group of the go bp term . because pax <dig> was reported to regulate granule cell polarization and migration in the developing cerebellum  <cit> , some of these factors might be involved in the molecular mechanisms of these events.

gohlke et al. reported go analyses of transcriptional profiling using mice deficient in or overexpressing ngn <dig> and mash <dig>  key transcriptional factors that promote neurogenesis  <cit> . genes were selected that were up-regulated in telencephalon tissues transfected with ngn <dig> or mash <dig>  and down-regulated in telencephalon tissues of ngn <dig> and/or mash <dig> knockout mice at e <dig> . among the  <dig> and  <dig> genes that had go annotations and were considered to be regulated by ngn <dig> and mash <dig>  respectively, 32% and 37% of the genes, respectively, were categorized with the go term "signal transduction/receptor", and 14% and 20% of the genes, respectively, were tagged with "regulation of transcription". these results agree with our list of candidate genes that might be regulated by pax <dig> in the e <dig>  rat hindbrain; such agreement is quite reasonable considering that ngn <dig> is reported to be directly induced by pax <dig> and to repress mash <dig>  <cit> .

downstream genes previously reported in pax <dig> mutants
we previously reported that the development of cranial motor neurons in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain is abnormal; two somatic motor nerve types--the abducent  and hypoglossal  motor neurons--are missing when pax <dig> function is lost  <cit>  owing to the abnormal formation of progenitor domains for these ventral motor neurons along the dorsoventral axis  <cit> . we also found that cadherin7/cadherin20-expressing nxii motor nuclei are absent in e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> rats  <cit> . the expression levels of genes that encode progenitor domain-specific homeodomain proteins and the secreted molecule wnt7b are altered in the ventricular zone of the e <dig>  mutant hindbrain  <cit> , although the identity of the other molecules involved in the downstream network of pax <dig> that affects hindbrain development remains unclear.

in this microarray study, the down-regulation of fabp <dig> and dbx <dig>  which has been previously described  <cit> , was confirmed. expression of fabp <dig> in the hindbrain showed a greater reduction at e <dig>  than at e <dig> , suggesting that regulation of fabp <dig> at the earlier stage is more dependent on pax <dig> function. a previous paper reported a loss of expression of ngn <dig> in the somatic motor neuron progenitor domain in the e <dig>  rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain  <cit> . in our analyses using e <dig>  hindbrains, we could not find a significant difference in ngn <dig> expression . we also compared ngn <dig> expression in the e <dig>  hindbrain via wish, but there was no remarkable difference between wt and rsey2/rsey <dig> . these findings suggest a temporally distinct regulation of ngn <dig> by pax <dig> 

hes family members  and bhlhb <dig> are other important bhlh transcription factors related to neurogenesis. in our microarray analyses, probe sets for hes <dig> suggested  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold down-regulation , although hes <dig> and hes <dig> expression levels did not differ between wt and rsey2/rsey <dig>  bhlhb <dig> expression was also significantly down-regulated in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain , similar to previous results of transcriptome analyses of the sey/sey mouse telencephalon  <cit> . bhlhb <dig> was reported to be expressed in the mouse cortical primordium and to control the subtype specificity of projection neurons  <cit> . furthermore, ngn <dig>  a downstream gene of pax <dig>  was shown to be upstream of bhlhb <dig>  <cit> . meanwhile, in humans, bhlhb <dig> is expressed in the cerebellum and can repress pax <dig> expression  <cit> . therefore, it is presumed that pax <dig> regulates the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells through the organization of bhlh transcription factors in a nested manner.

although we could not detect down-regulation of wnt7b in the e <dig>  hindbrain as found at e <dig>   <cit> , another member of the wnt family, wnt7a, showed significant down-regulation  as reported in the mouse forebrain  <cit> . therefore, the regulation of downstream genes by pax <dig> seems to be quite context-dependent; pax <dig> may differentially regulate the expression of target molecules according to stage and tissue.

novel downstream genes of pax <dig> and their relationship to the anteroposterior patterning of the hindbrain
in the present study, we identified novel candidates for pax <dig> downstream molecules. first, unc5h <dig> expression was abolished in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain in the ventral expression domain of pax <dig> within r <dig> to r <dig> . furthermore, unc5h <dig> expression was detected in the dorsal part of r <dig> and in the spinal cord , where pax <dig> was not detected at e <dig>  ; however, pax <dig> was expressed at an earlier stage in wt and rsey2/+ . in the hindbrain of rsey2/rsey <dig>  almost no expression of unc5h <dig> was revealed by wish . from these results, we suspect that expression of unc5h <dig> is regulated by pax <dig> prior to e <dig> . in the cerebellum of the pax <dig> homozygous mutant mouse, unc5h <dig> expression is completely absent in the external granule cell layer  <cit> . these findings may suggest a common regulation of expression of duplicated unc <dig> family genes by pax <dig> 

another pax <dig> downstream candidate is cyp26b <dig>  an ra catabolic enzyme. a lack of cyp26b <dig> results in the dispersion of the ra signal in the developing limb  <cit> . ra is thought to act as a diffusible morphogen that patterns the hindbrain along the anteroposterior axis, and degradation of ra by cyp26s is a major determinant of spatiotemporally specific ra signaling . ra also alters the migration patterns of cranial neural crest cells in the rat embryo  <cit> . we found that cyp26b <dig> expression was specifically abolished in r <dig> and r <dig> in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain . these two rhombomeres express the kreisler gene, which encodes the mafb transcription factor, a protein with a critical role in caudal hindbrain patterning  <cit> . maf partners with pax <dig> for synergistic transcriptional activation of several crystallin and glucagon genes  <cit> . therefore, the expression of cyp26b <dig> in r <dig> and r <dig> is assumed to be regulated by pax <dig> together with mafb.

although knockout mice lacking cyp26b <dig> function show no major defects in the hindbrain  <cit> , two reports describe the contribution of cyp26b <dig> to hindbrain development in zebrafish; hernandez et al. found that injection of a cyp26b <dig> antisense morpholino oligonucleotide  into cyp26a <dig> mutants caused expansion of r <dig> and an anterior shift of the r6/ <dig> boundary  <cit> . additionally, reijntjes et al. showed, by preventing the splicing of the cyp26b <dig> transcript in wt embryos using another cyp26b <dig> mo, a reduced rhombomere size and defects in craniofacial structures at later stages  <cit> . in detailed analyses of rhombomeres using a krox <dig> probe, we observed that the r <dig> region was broadened anteroposteriorly to some extent . this result represents a novel finding that anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain is altered in the pax <dig> mutant. consistent with this result, we found a slight up-regulation of krox <dig> .

recently, the hoxd <dig> gene was reported to be a direct target of pax <dig>  hoxd <dig> expression in r <dig> and the spinal cord is reduced to some extent in the pax <dig> mutant mouse embryo, and double knock-down of pax6a and pax6b with mos resulted in malformed rhombomere boundaries and an anteriorized hoxd4a expression border in the zebrafish embryo  <cit> . in our microarray analyses, hoxd <dig> showed slight down-regulation with statistical significance , although its expression level was quite high, even in the rsey2/rsey <dig> hindbrain . therefore, we consider that a loss of pax <dig> function affects the anteroposterior patterning of r <dig> by cyp26b <dig> down-regulation rather than by regulation of hoxd <dig> gene expression.

the anteroposterior defect that we observed in the pax <dig> mutant hindbrain was very mild as compared with that of phenotypes induced by excess ra . it would be interesting to determine how mildly elevated levels of ra signaling affect rhombomere formation and subsequent neural function.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified unc5h <dig> and cyp26b <dig> as novel downstream genes of pax <dig> in the early development of the hindbrain. in addition, the broadening of the r <dig> region in pax <dig> mutant embryos raises the possibility that pax <dig> regulates the anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain via activation of the ra-metabolizing enzyme cyp26b <dig>
