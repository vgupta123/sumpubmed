BACKGROUND
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , also known as prion diseases, include creutzfeldt-jakob disease and kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. the central event in these diseases is thought to be the conversion of a host-encoded cellular prion protein  into an abnormally folded disease-associated isoform, designated prpsc  <cit> . aggregates of prpsc accumulate around neurons in affected brain areas  <cit> , a process which is thought to lead to neuronal dysfunction and the clinical symptoms of infection. prpsc constitutes the major and perhaps the only component of the infectious particle  <cit> .

the process of prion replication has been studied extensively in prion-infected neuronal cell lines. treatment with some cholesterol synthesis inhibitors reduced the production of prpsc in scrapie-infected neuronal cells  <cit> . the anti-prion effect of such drugs is attributed to cholesterol depletion affecting the formation of specialised membrane micro-domains called lipid rafts  <cit> . these lipid rafts are highly enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids and gangliosides, and contain specific proteins  <cit> . the presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor that mediates the attachment of proteins including prpc and prpsc to membranes, targets these proteins to lipid rafts  <cit> .

since cholesterol levels are a factor determining prpsc formation  <cit> , the effects of compounds reported to affect cellular cholesterol levels were examined. polyunsaturated fatty acids  are fatty acids which contain two or more double bonds within their hydrocarbon chain. they are taken as dietary supplements by large numbers of people for their perceived health benefits against a variety of diseases including coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . the common pufa include docosahexaenoic acid , eicosapentaenoic acid , arachidonic acid , linoleic acid  and linolenic acid  and in most cells pufa are rapidly incorporated into phospholipids  <cit> . the incorporation of pufa into phospholipids alters the composition and physical properties of cell membranes  <cit> . since dietary pufa reduce cellular cholesterol levels  <cit>  the effects of pufa on the composition of neuronal cell membranes and on the production of prpsc were examined. we report that treatment with dha or epa significantly reduced the amounts of free cholesterol in scgt <dig>  scn2a and smb cells. however, in contrast to the effects of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, treatment with dha or epa actually increased prpsc formation. dha or epa treatment also increased the activity of phospholipase a <dig> , an enzyme reported to affect prpsc formation  <cit> . they also increased the amount of prpc, that is essential for the development of prion diseases  <cit> , at the cell surface, a putative site for prpsc formation. in conclusion our data indicate that cholesterol depletion per se does not reduce prpsc formation.

RESULTS
dha and epa increase prpsc in prion-infected neuronal cells
the effect of pufa on the formation of prpsc in scgt <dig> cells was determined by daily treatment with  <dig> μm pufa for  <dig> days. significantly higher amounts of prpsc were found in cells treated with dha  or epa  than in untreated cells, or cells treated with aa, la or lna . treatment with dha or epa did not affect the survival of scgt <dig> cells . immunoblots were used to verify the elisa data; these showed that there were observable differences in the amounts of prpsc between untreated cells and cells treated with  <dig> μm dha or  <dig> μm epa . in contrast, the amounts of β-actin in untreated cells and cells treated with dha or epa were not significantly different. determination of the effects of different pufa on prpsc formation in scgt <dig> cells revealed that whereas treatment with either dha or docosapentaenoic  significantly increased amounts of prpsc present, treatment with docosatetraenoic acid  or la did not. similarly, while treatment with epa increased the amounts of prpsc in scgt <dig> cells, treatment with eicosatetraenoic acid  did not. the effects of dha, dpa and epa on the prpsc content of scgt <dig> cells were dose-dependent .

to confirm that the effects of dha or epa were not specific for scgt <dig> cells the amounts of prpsc in scn2a and smb cells were also examined. the amounts of prpsc in scn2a cells treated for  <dig> days with  <dig> μm dha or  <dig> μm epa, but not in cells treated with lna, la or aa, were significantly higher than in untreated cells . similar results were obtained with smb cells; treatment with dha or epa increased the amounts of cell-associated prpsc. since prpsc can be released from cells as exosomes or as result of cell damage  <cit> , the amounts of prpsc in the supernatants of treated cells were also measured. the amounts of prpsc in the supernatants of scgt <dig>  scn2a or smb cells treated with  <dig> μm dha or  <dig> μm epa were significantly higher than in supernatants from untreated cells .

the amounts of prpsc in cell extracts  and in culture supernatants  from prion-infected neuronal cells treated for  <dig> days with  <dig> μm pufa as shown. amounts of prpsc were measured by prp-specific elisa and are expressed as the mean average prpsc  ± sd of scgt <dig> , scn2a  and smb cells . * = amounts of prpc significantly different from that of untreated cells .

dha and epa reduced free cholesterol in scgt <dig> cells
the effect of 24-hour exposure to pufa on the cholesterol content of scgt <dig> cell extracts was examined. exposure to  <dig> μm dha or epa, but not to lna or la, significantly reduced their free cholesterol content . none of the pufa tested had a significant effect on the amounts of protein in these extracts . the amounts of free cholesterol in cells treated with dha or epa were similar to those in cells treated with  <dig> μm simvastatin, which inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa  reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis  <cit> . however, total cholesterol is a combination of free cholesterol found in cell membranes and cholesterol esters. simvastatin reduced the amounts of free cholesterol in cell extracts without affecting the amounts of cholesterol esters, resulting in a reduction in total cellular cholesterol. in contrast, the total cholesterol content of scgt <dig> cells treated with dha or epa was not significantly altered, as the reduction in free cholesterol was accompanied by significant increases in the amounts of cholesterol esters. the addition of dha or epa to scn2a or smb cells had similar effects; they significantly reduced free cholesterol levels and increased the cholesterol ester content of these cells .

the amounts of total, free and esterified cholesterol in extracts from scgt <dig> cells treated for  <dig> hours with pufa, simvastatin, or with cholesterol esters as shown. amounts of total, free and esterified cholesterol were expressed as the mean average  ± sd, n =  <dig>  amounts of total cholesterol , free cholesterol  or esterified cholesterol  significantly different from that of untreated cells .

such observations raised the possibility that the increased amounts of cholesterol esters in prion-infected cells facilitate prpsc formation. this possibility was examined by treating scgt <dig> cells with  <dig> μm cholesterol esters . we report that although treatment increased the amounts of cholesterol esters in scgt <dig> cells, there were no significant differences in the amounts of free cholesterol in these cells , indicating that the cholesterol esters were not hydrolysed. the addition of cholesterol esters did not affect prpsc formation; there were no significant differences between the prpsc content of vehicle-treated scgt <dig> cells and scgt <dig> cells treated for  <dig> days with  <dig> μm cholesterol myristate  or cholesterol arachidonate . similarly, the addition of cholesterol myristate or cholesterol arachidonate did not significantly affect the amounts of prpsc in scn2a cells or in smb cells .

effects of dha and epa are not reversed by mevalonate
the effects of dha and epa on cellular cholesterol levels and prpsc formation were compared with those of simvastatin. as shown in figure 3a, the exposure of scgt <dig> cells to  <dig> μm dha or epa for  <dig> days significantly decreased the free cholesterol content of cell extracts, as did  <dig> μm simvastatin. however, while the addition of  <dig> μm mevalonate significantly increased the amounts of free cholesterol in simvastatin-treated cells  ±  <dig> compared with  <dig> ng/ml ±  <dig>  n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ), it did not affect the amounts of free cholesterol in cells treated with dha  or epa . rather, the addition of mevalonate to dha-treated cells significantly increased the amounts of cholesterol esters . next we examined the effects of mevalonate on prpsc formation in scgt <dig> cells treated with simvastatin, dha or epa. the addition of  <dig> μm mevalonate significantly increased the amounts of prpsc in simvastatin-treated cells . in contrast, it did not affect the amounts of prpsc in scgt <dig> cells treated with dha  or epa , indicating that the effect of dha and epa on prpsc formation was not due to hmg-coa reductase inhibition .

dha increases pla <dig> activity of prion-infected neuronal cells
since the amounts of activated cytoplasmic pla <dig>  in scgt <dig> cells correlates with the amounts of prpsc  <cit>  and pla <dig> inhibitors reduce prpsc formation  <cit> , the effects of pufa on the activity of pla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells was determined. we report that treatment with  <dig> μm dha for  <dig> hours significantly increased the amounts of phosphorylated  cpla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells . treatment with  <dig> μm epa for  <dig> hours also significantly increased amounts of activated cpla <dig> , but treatment with  <dig> μm aa, la or lna had no significant affect . the addition of  <dig> μm cholesterol myristate did not affect activation of cpla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells . this effect of treatment with  <dig> μm dha or epa was specific for prion-infected cells and did not affect the amounts of activated cpla <dig> in gt <dig> cells or primary cortical neurons. to examine this relationship further we compared the amounts of prpsc and activated cpla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells treated with varying concentrations of dha or epa. there was a positive correlation between the amounts of activated cpla <dig> at  <dig> hours and the prpsc content of cells after  <dig> days  .

the cpla <dig> isoform is largely responsible for the release of aa and increased production of prostaglandins. here we show that the amounts of prostaglandin e <dig>  produced by scgt <dig> cells was significantly increased by 24-hour treatment with  <dig> μm dha  or epa , but not by la or lna . the addition of  <dig> μm dha or epa did not affect pge <dig> production in gt <dig> cells. furthermore, the increased amounts of prpsc in dha or epa-treated scgt <dig> cells showed a positive correlation with the amounts of pge <dig> produced . treatment with  <dig> μm dha also increased the production of pge <dig> in scn2a cells  and in smb cells .

dha increases the surface expression of prpc
since prpc is necessary for prpsc formation  <cit> . the effects of pufa treatment on the expression of prpc were examined. these studies were initially performed on primary cortical neurons that do not contain the infectious prpsc to avoid any possible confusion between prpc and prpsc. treatment with  <dig> μm pufa for  <dig> hours did not affect the total amounts of prpc in whole cell membrane extracts. although prpc is normally found within lipid raft micro-domains  <cit> , treatment with  <dig> μm simvastatin caused the redistribution of prpc into the normal bulk membrane. in contrast, treatment with pufa did not alter the distribution of prpc between lipid rafts and the bulk membrane .

the amounts of prpc in whole cell extracts, detergent insoluble membranes  and the detergent soluble membrane  from primary cortical neurons treated with  <dig> μm pufa or  <dig> μm simvastatin for  <dig> hours. amounts of prpc were measured by elisa and are expressed as the mean average prpc  ± sd, n =  <dig>  * = amounts of prpc significantly different from that of untreated cells .

the amounts of prpc at the cell surface were measured by digesting neurons with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c . pi-plc digestion releases gpi-anchored molecules including prpc from the cell surface  <cit> . the amounts of prpc released by pi-plc from  <dig> cortical neurons treated with  <dig> μm dha or  <dig> μm epa for  <dig> hours were significantly higher than the amounts released from untreated neurons or neurons treated with  <dig> μm cholesterol esters . treatment with dha or epa for  <dig> hours also significantly increased the amounts of surface prpc in gt <dig> and scgt <dig> cells. it is noteworthy that the amounts of prpc released by pi-plc from untreated scgt <dig> cells were significantly higher than from untreated gt <dig> cells . the effect of dha or epa on cell surface prpc expression contrasted to that of simvastatin, which reduced surface prpc expression  <cit> . when the amounts of prpc at the surface of scgt <dig> cells treated with different concentrations of dha or epa were plotted against the amounts of prpsc in scgt <dig> treated for  <dig> days with the same concentrations of dha or epa, a significant correlation was observed  .

the amounts of prpc at the surface of  <dig> cells treated with  <dig> μm pufa or  <dig> μm simvastatin for  <dig> hours were measured following digestion with pi-plc . amounts of prpc were measured by elisa and are expressed as the mean average prpc  ± sd, n =  <dig>  # = amounts of prpc significantly higher than that of untreated cells . * = amounts of prpc significantly lower than that of untreated cells .

in a further set of experiments, treated cortical neurons were pulsed with membrane-impermeable biotin and the amounts of biotinylated-prpc in cell membranes were determined at time points thereafter. the amounts of biotinylated-prpc in neuronal extracts were reduced in a time-dependent manner. significantly, in neurons treated with  <dig> μm dha or epa the amounts of biotinylated prpc remaining in extracts after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours were significantly greater than those in extracts from untreated cells. while the half-life of biotinylated prpc in untreated neurons was approximately  <dig> hours, in dha or epa-treated neurons the half-life was increased to approximately  <dig> hours .

discussion
the main goal of this study was to investigate the effects of pufa on the production of prpsc, a biochemical marker for the infectious agent of prion diseases. we report that treatment with dha or epa, but not with aa, la or lna, consistently increased the amounts of prpsc within three prion-infected neuronal cell lines . this effect of pufa correlated with the number of unsaturated bonds in the acyl chain; increased prpsc content was observed in scgt <dig> cells treated with dha  and epa or dpa , while treatment with pufa containing four or less unsaturated bonds  did not affect prpsc formation. the increased prpsc content of dha or epa-treated cells was accompanied by increased prpsc content of culture supernatants, indicating that this treatment did not prevent the release of prpsc via exosomes or cell damage.

cholesterol synthesis inhibitors disrupt lipid rafts and reduced prpsc formation  <cit> . more recently, observations that cholesterol synthesis inhibitors delay experimental scrapie  <cit>  increased the interest in the concept of cholesterol reduction as a means of treating prion diseases. pufa are reported to reduce cellular cholesterol and here we show that treatment with dha and epa significantly reduced the free cholesterol content of scgt <dig> cells. however, the effects of dha or epa on cellular cholesterol differed from those of the hmg-coa inhibitor simvastatin. for example, treatment with simvastatin, but not with dha or epa, significantly reduced total cholesterol levels. the reduction in free cholesterol levels seen in scgt <dig> cells treated with dha and epa was accompanied by a significant increase in the amounts of cholesterol esters, and the total cholesterol content of dha and epa-treated cells was not significantly different from that of untreated cells. although the increase in the prpsc content of dha and epa-treated cells was accompanied by an increase in cholesterol esters, the addition of cholesterol esters did not increase prpsc formation, suggesting that the relationship between cholesterol esters and prpsc is casual rather than causal. furthermore, the effects of dha and epa on cholesterol ester formation were independent of prion-infection; dha and epa increased cholesterol esters in uninfected n2a or gt <dig> cell lines and in primary cortical neurons .

the amount of free cholesterol in cell membranes is partly determined by their fatty acid composition; the solubility of free cholesterol is dependent on the hydrophobic environment produced by the tight packing of saturated fatty acids  <cit> . the presence of double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids causes the acyl chain to be kinked; as a result, phospholipids containing pufa cannot pack as tightly as phospholipids containing saturated fatty acids and do not sequester as much free cholesterol. thus, the remodelling of membrane phospholipids to include increased amounts of dha or epa is expected to reduce the capacity of membranes to solubilise free cholesterol. the amounts of free cholesterol within cell membranes is tightly controlled  <cit>  and excess free cholesterol trafficking into the endoplasmic reticulum  is esterified by acyl-coenzyme a: cholesterol acyltransferase  and stored in cytoplasmic droplets  <cit> . our results are consistent with the hypothesis that treatment with dha and epa reduces the capacity of cell membranes to solubilise free cholesterol, resulting in increased cholesterol ester formation. this hypothesis also explains the observation that the addition of mevalonate did not reverse the effects of dha and epa. while mevalonate increased the amounts of free cholesterol in simvastatin-treated cells, in dha or epa-treated cells the newly synthesised cholesterol was not held in the membrane and was rapidly esterified. similarly, while the addition of mevalonate reversed the effects of simvastatin on prpsc formation, it did not reverse the effects of dha and epa.

so how could changes in membrane composition affect prpsc formation? the composition of cell membranes affects the aggregation of prpsc and fibril formation  <cit> . therefore, changes in cell membranes induced by dha and epa may enhance the conversion of small prpsc oligomers, that are thought to be sensitive to protease digestion   <cit> , into the larger fibrillar, protease-resistant deposits of prpsc. the amount of free cholesterol in cell membranes is also instrumental in the formation of lipid rafts  <cit> . these contain many signalling molecules, and an emerging paradigm is that of cell activation occurring as a consequence of individual rafts coalescing to form a platform capable of sustained cell activation. therefore, changes in membrane free cholesterol caused by the incorporation of dha or epa into membrane phospholipids may affect lipid-raft formation and associated cellular functions  <cit> . in this study we examined the effects of pufa treatment on pla <dig> activity, as pla <dig> has a critical role in prpsc formation  <cit> . as activation of pla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells is cholesterol-sensitive  <cit> , treatment with dha or epa was expected to reduce pla <dig> activity. however, they significantly increased pla <dig> activity and pge <dig> production in scgt <dig>  scn2a and smb cells. the mechanisms by which dha or epa increased activation of pla <dig> are unclear. since dha triggers the formation of lipid rafts  <cit>  it is possible that treatment with dha or epa strengthens the association between pla <dig> and prpsc within a lipid raft. however, it should be noted that dha may have other physical effects on membrane properties that are independent of cholesterol reduction  <cit> . for example, in some cells dha released from membrane phospholipids by pla <dig> is metabolised into docosanoids  <cit> . the effects of such dha metabolites are only just being elucidated and the possibility that specific docosanoids affect prpsc formation cannot be discounted. similarly, pufa have been reported to affect gene regulation  <cit>  and we do not exclude the possibility that the effects of dha or epa on prpsc formation result from gene activation.

we examined the possibility that the increased prpsc production in dha or epa-treated cells might be a consequence of their effects on the expression of prpc. treatment of neurons with dha or epa did not affect the total amounts of prpc in cell extracts, or the distribution of prpc between lipid rafts and the bulk membrane. however, it significantly increased the amounts of prpc expressed at the cell surface. this effect of dha and epa contrasted with that of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitors simvastatin or lovastatin, which reduced surface prpc expression  <cit> . prior studies indicated that prpc, but not prpsc, is released from cell membranes following pi-plc digestion  <cit> , and in the present studies, the prp released from scgt <dig> cells was protease-sensitive, indicating that the prp released was indeed prpc. these assays were also performed on non-infected gt <dig> cells and cortical neurons with similar results; treatment with either dha or epa significantly increased the amounts of prpc at the cell surface, showing that the effects of dha or epa on prpc expression were not secondary to their effects on prpsc formation.

these observations are relevant as antibody studies suggest that the conversion of prpc to prpsc occurs at the cell surface or after internalisation from the cell surface  <cit> . our hypothesis, that treatment with dha or epa increases the amount of prpc at the cell surface, a site where it could be readily converted to prpsc, is supported by the positive correlation obtained between the amounts of prpc at the cell surface and prpsc in scgt <dig> cells. in addition, the half-life of surface prpc was greatly increased in dha or epa-treated cells. taken together these results suggest that treatment with dha or epa alters endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of prpc, consistent with reports that the intracellular trafficking of prpc is critical for prpsc formation  <cit> . the effect of dha or epa on prpc is relevant not only for prion diseases but may also have implications for alzheimer's disease. the cellular prpc present in lipid rafts inhibits beta-secretase activity, reducing the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid β formation  <cit> . thus the regulation of prpc levels may represent an innovative approach for the modulation of amyloid deposition in the brain of individuals affected by alzheimer's disease.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that treatment of prion-infected cells with dha or epa alters the composition of cell membranes; it decreased amounts of free cholesterol and increased cholesterol esters. in contrast to the effects of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, treatment with dha or epa increased prpsc formation. treatment with dha or epa greatly increased the expression of prpc at the cell surface, a putative site for prpsc formation, and altered cell signalling activity within prion-infected cells, increasing the activation of pla <dig> that is required for prpsc formation  <cit> . cholesterol depletion has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for prion diseases, based on reports that cholesterol synthesis inhibitors reduced prpsc formation. the studies reported here demonstrate that cholesterol depletion per se does not reduce prpsc formation and cautions against such an approach. while these observations provide some insight into the composition of lipid rafts and the activation of signalling pathways that initiate the formation of prpsc, future studies are needed to examine the precise relationship between free cholesterol, prpc expression and prpsc formation.
