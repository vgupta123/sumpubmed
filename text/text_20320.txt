BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of small, non-coding, single-stranded rna molecules of 18- <dig> nucleotides. in various species, they play roles in gene regulation by targeting mrnas at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . in plants, mirnas are involved in organ development and environmental responses  <cit> . although several mirna and target prediction tools are available  <cit> , the number of tools customized for plant mirna and target analysis is limited. among them are microharvester, a web server for identifying plant mirnas  <cit> ; the miru  <cit> , psrnatarget  <cit> , and tapir  <cit>  web servers for identifying plant mirna targets; a web-based toolkit for the analysis of plant small rnas  <cit> ; and the mirtour web server for plant mirna and target prediction  <cit> . most of these public web servers limit the number of input sequences and focus on only mirna or target identification. target-align  <cit>  was recently proposed for plant mirna target identification and developed as both web and command line versions. even though several studies in computational identification of plant mirnas and their targets are available  <cit> , their methods were mainly presented as flow diagrams of connected programs . to follow the same steps, users need to install these programs, understand their usage, comprehend the meaning and format of the results, and have the programming experience for connecting them together.

taking into account all these computational steps and criteria for plant mirna and target identification  <cit> , we developed c-mii, a standalone software package with graphical user interfaces for identifying, manipulating, and analyzing plant mirnas and targets. c-mii is implemented as an all-in-one java package weaving together sequence similarity search, secondary structure folding, automatic stem-loop identification and manipulation, and functional and gene ontology  annotation. in addition, it comes pre-installed with databases of proteins, non-coding rnas, and mature mirnas. c-mii expects a set of nucleotide sequences , genome survey sequences ) in fasta format as input. the identification steps are divided into mirna and target identification pipelines. users can customize parameter settings for each step of the identification, and filter and manipulate the results according to various biological criteria.

materials and methods
workflow overview
the target identification pipeline consists of four consecutive modules: sequence loading and validation, target scanning, mirna-target folding, and target annotation. the sequence loading module is the same as that for mirna identification, but accepts input sequences of longer lengths . the target scanning module determines if input sequences contain the complementary sites to mature mirnas of interest. implementation of this module is similar to the homolog search except for the use of reverse-complement mature mirnas as queries for blast. the mirna-target folding module utilizes unafold to predict the secondary structure and free energy of mirna:target duplexes. this module was introduced to c-mii to help refine the target identification result. the last module, target annotation, supplies function and gene ontology  for the potential target sequences. along the computational steps of both pipelines, users can customize parameters for their execution, select databases of interest, and explore and filter the results.

pre-installed databases
the pre-installed databases of c-mii are divided into three categories. first, the mature mirna database, mirbase release  <dig>  was incorporated for homolog search. second, the non-coding rna database, rfam  <dig> with removed mirnas, was introduced for removing other types of rnas. third, the protein databases, the uniprotkb/swiss-prot release 2010_ <dig> and uniprotkb/trembl release 2011_ <dig>  were incorporated for removing protein-coding sequences in the primary and precursor mirna folding steps and for identifying gene functions during target annotation. these databases were pre-processed using the formatdb program in the blast package. users can update these databases from our web site via a menu in c-mii. furthermore, users can integrate their own protein and non-coding rna databases into the system by following the pre-processing steps documented on the c-mii web site.

pre-installed software packages
to ease its installation and usage, c-mii was designed as a complete package containing all required software, including blast, java development kit , perl, python, unafold, and ghostscript  <cit> , which can be customized during installation. to explore conservation and co-evolution among the predicted and known precursors or mature mirnas of an mirna family, clustal w  <cit> , muscle  <cit>  and jalview  <cit>  were pre-installed for performing and visualizing the multiple sequence alignment of selected identification results. in addition, we have deployed prefuse visualization toolkit  <cit> , icepdf viewer  <cit> , and jfreechart  <cit>  for visualizing go trees, the secondary structure folding of primary and precursor mirnas, and the infographics, respectively.

RESULTS
c-mii is composed of two pipelines for plant mirna and target identifications, which could be used autonomously or consecutively. the functionalities of these pipelines have been described with biological rationales and a running example .

mirna identification pipeline
taking into account the computational steps and criteria for plant mirna identification as described previously  <cit> , the mirna prediction menu consists of four consecutive submenus starting from sequence loading, homolog search, primary mirna folding, and precursor mirna folding. users need to build a new project before uploading nucleotide sequences in a fasta file. sequences longer than  <dig>  nt or containing characters other than a, t, c, g, u, and n will be excluded. as a running example, we built a tair <dig> cdna project of  <dig>  sequences. due to sequence validation,  <dig>  sequences remained as input for the homolog search.

homolog search
the homolog search module helps users identify input sequences that contain mature mirna sequences from mirbase. in this step, users can select mature mirnas of multiple plants from mirbase to be used as source mature mirnas for the identification process. the identification methods include sequence scans with and without blast. the sequence scan with blast is much faster, but with the trade-off of possibly missing matches due to the word size limitation of blastn, which needs to be  <dig> or greater. users can also customize the e-value  of blastn, the number of allowed mismatches  between a source mature mirna and its homolog in an input sequence, and the number of processors automatically detected by c-mii for running the homolog search. figure 2a shows the homolog search results for arabidopsis mature mirnas from mirbase with the  <dig>  tair <dig> cdna sequences with default parameter settings. using the plus strand only,  <dig> arabidopsis cdnas of  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> members were identified. we selected all these sequences as input for the primary mirna folding module.

primary mirna folding
an mirna gene needs to be non-coding and have a stem-loop precursor in its secondary structure  <cit> . the primary mirna folding module helps users remove protein-coding sequences and other types of non-coding rnas from input sequences, and predicts the secondary structure folding of primary mirnas  from the remaining sequences. the removal of unwanted sequence types is based on blastx and blastn against protein and non-coding rna databases, selectable by users. users can also adjust the e-value to limit the number of search results. the lower the e-value, the larger the number of sequences remains for secondary structure folding. c-mii sets the default e-value of blastn against rfam as 1e- <dig> according to our previous benchmark  <cit> . users may also customize the folding temperature, maximum base pair distance, and maximum bulge or interior loop size of unafold.

precursor mirna folding
the precursor mirna folding module helps users  extract the stem-loop structures from the secondary structures of pri-mirnas,  remove stem-loop sequences that hit protein-coding sequences and other types of non-coding rnas,  re-predict the secondary structure folding of the extracted stem-loop sequences, and  verify the predicted structures with previously suggested criteria. with the auto mode setting from the previous step, the precursor mirna folding module will cleave a pri-mirna structure from the start position of the found homologous mirna to the end position of its duplex mirna* with two-nucleotide 3' overhangs. the extracted stem-loop sequences are screened against the protein and non-coding rna databases again. unafold is then reapplied to the remaining sequences to predict the secondary structure folding of precursor mirnas . users can customize the same set of parameters as in the primary mirna folding step.

target identification pipeline
c-mii's target prediction menu consists of four submenus: sequence loading, target scanning, mirna-target folding, and target annotation. users may build a new project for target identification only or continue the project from the mirna identification pipeline. users may also upload a new set of nucleotide sequences in fasta format or reuse the uploaded sequences from the mirna identification process. however, the acceptable length of an input sequence for target identification is extended to  <dig>  nt. besides sequence uploading, users also need to select mature mirnas of interest from mirbase and/or from predicted mature mirnas saved from the mirna identification pipeline. in our running example,  <dig> sequences previously reported as mirna-specific targets in arabidopsis were uploaded to a new project and all mature arabidopsis mirnas from mirbase were selected for target scanning.

target scanning
based on plant-mirna target binding through perfect or nearly-perfect complementarities  <cit> , the target scanning module allows users to scan for complementary sites of selected mature mirnas on input sequences. based on criteria used in rhoades et al.  <cit> , users can customize the binding score as described in  <cit> . the scanning methods are the same as that of the homolog search with the reverse-complement of mature mirnas used as queries for blast. users can filter the results by the number of gu pairs, binding score, and mismatched position of interest. in addition, as the specific positions of mismatches affect mirna targeting  <cit> , c-mii also allows users to filter for target sequences whose mirna binding site has no more than one mismatch at positions 1- <dig>  no more than two consecutive mismatches, and no mismatches at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  figure 3a shows the target scanning results of our running example with default parameter settings. using the plus strand only,  <dig> out of  <dig> sequences were identified as mirna binding sites for  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> members. all of them were selected as input for mirna-target folding.

mirna-target folding
the mirna-target folding module helps users refine their scanning results. it uses unafold to predict the secondary structures of mirna:target duplexes, mfes for hybridization, and binding positions of mirna-target pairs. users can specify the temperature that might affect mirna:target duplex formation. figure 3b shows the mirna-target folding results of our running example using the default  <dig> ºc. from the results, users can determine potential mirna targets based on the binding score from target scanning, the number of mismatches and g:u pairs between mirna and its potential target from mirna-target folding, mismatched positions, mfes, and overlapped binding positions between the two steps. in our example, with the plus strand only, all  <dig> sequences remained for target annotation.

target annotation
the target annotation module supplies function and gene ontology  for potential targets selected from the previous step. users can choose a protein database and customize the e-value and number of hits for blastx. figure 3c shows the target annotation results of  <dig> out of  <dig> sequences using default parameter settings . from the results, users may explore go annotation for a set of targets. by clicking on "graph icon," c-mii calculates and visualizes the distribution of selected targets' go ids, colored by go molecular function , biological process , and cellular component . from this view, users may also explore potential targets annotated with the same go. the "go view" allows users to investigate go annotation of an individual potential target via a go tree . users may also follow web links to public databases of known mirnas and target functions.

summary views
the project summary view provides users with the overall number of identified mirna families and targets, which can be exported as a report and linked back to the detailed identification results. the mirna prediction view  shows the overall number of input sequences, excluded sequences, sequences potentially encoding mirnas, and the identified mirna families and members. the infographics highlight the distribution of the identified mirna families. the "group by sequence" and "group by mirna" options allow users to explore the identified mirnas for the same sequence and the list of sequences identified for the same mirna. the "detail" icon allows users to follow the link back to the results of precursor mirna folding. similarly, the target prediction view  shows the overall number of input sequences, excluded sequences, the identified targets, and source mirna families and members having targets.

system validation and benchmarking
for system benchmarking, we applied c-mii to the four datasets:  tair <dig> cdnas ,  tair <dig> mirnas ,  arabidopsis precursor mirnas from mirbase  <dig> , and  plant rnas that are not mirnas from rfam  <dig>  . the source of mature mirnas was arabidopsis mirnas from mirbase  <dig>  with default parameter settings except the e-value ≤ 1e- <dig> for blastx against the uniprot/swiss-prot protein database, table  <dig> shows the number of remaining input sequences filtered for plus strand from each step of mirna identification on the four datasets.

the previously reported  <dig> sequences of mirna-associated targets of arabidopsis  were used for benchmarking the target identification . the sensitivity was measured with two sets of parameter settings. the default settings included a binding score ≤  <dig> in target scanning, a folding temperature =  <dig> ºc for unafold in mirna-target folding, and an e-value ≤ 1e- <dig> for blastx against the plant-only uniprotkb/swiss-prot database in target annotation. the customized settings used a binding score ≤  <dig> in target scanning and an e-value ≤ 1e- <dig> instead of 1e- <dig> in target annotation. with mature arabidopsis mirnas from mirbase, c-mii identified  <dig> out of  <dig> mirna-associated target sequences using default settings and the plus strand filter. twenty-four sequences were lost due to the overly limited binding score, which was ≤  <dig> in the default settings. the other ten mirna-associated targets of seven distinct tair <dig> gene loci were lost in the annotation step; four out of seven were trans-acting sirnas while the other three had too large hit e-values . table  <dig> shows the number of known target sequences remaining from each step of target identification. with the use of the uniprotkb/swiss-prot protein database, the sensitivity of the identification calculated as tp/ was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the default and customized settings respectively.

* the default and customized binding scores for target scanning were ≤  <dig> and ≤  <dig>  respectively.

** the default and customized blastx e-values for target annotation were 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig>  respectively. both protein databases were prepared with plants only.

we measured the efficiency of multi-thread management on ubuntu  <dig>   machine with four intel core <dig> quad cpu q <dig> at  <dig>  ghz, 8gb ram. the average speed of the mirna and target identifications on tair <dig> cdnas with default parameter settings was improved by  <dig> % and  <dig> % from single to two and four threads .

* the format of time usage is hours:minutes:seconds
