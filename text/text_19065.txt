BACKGROUND
numerous neuropeptide precusors have been implicated in the regulation of energy balance, such as pro-opiomelanocortin , melanin concentrating hormone  and ghrelin. neuropeptide precursors have a propeptide which translocates the neuropeptide precursors from the rough-endoplasmatic reticulum to the trans-golgi network . from the tgn the peptide precursors traffic into immature secretory vesicles where they are cleaved once or multiple times by prohormone convertases  1/ <dig> and/or  <dig> to generate functional neuropeptides  <cit> . through budding and fusion the immature vesicles become mature, dense, vesicles which release their content upon a specific signal  <cit> .

the processing of neuropeptide precursors results in multiple biologically active peptides, sometimes with opposing effects; an example is the pomc gene. pre-pro pomc is processed into several neuropeptides with anorexigenic functions, e.g. α-melanocyte stimulating hormone  and β-msh, but also into an opioid with "orexigenic" function, namely β-endorphin  <cit> . loss of the whole pomc gene results in hyperphagia and obesity  <cit> . although there is strong evidence that the lack of melanocortin signaling in pomc knockout mice explains the phenotype, mice lacking only the β-endorphin part of the pomc gene are also hyperphagic and obese  <cit> . another example of a precursor gene that encodes for peptides with diverse effects is pre-pro-ghrelin which encodes for ghrelin, an appetite stimulating hormone, and obestatin, an appetite suppressing hormone  <cit> . therefore, it is important to determine the role of individual neuropeptides encoded by a precursor gene.

to investigate the role of specific neuropeptides, synthesized neuropeptides can be injected through intracerebroventricular  or local cannulae in the brain. however, there are drawbacks to these techniques. icv administration of neuropeptides can be done long term, but administration is not local. in contrast, neuropeptides remain local with local cannulae, but these experiments are usually short term, because the cannulae can not be maintained over weeks. to overexpress neuropeptides locally and for long periods of time one can use viral vectors, such as adeno-associated viral  vectors  <cit> . there are two problems with the long term overexpression of neuropeptide genes. firstly, the precursor gene encodes for multiple peptides, which may serve different functions . therefore, overexpression of the precursor gene may show the effects multiple peptides. the second problem, with overexpression of neuropeptides via viral vectors, is that the neuropeptide is potentially released in an area to which the transduced neuron projects rather than secretion locally at the site of transduction; with aav mediated overexpression of neuropeptide y  in the paraventricular nucleus   <cit>  the release of npy may thus not be limited to the pvn. in the hypothalamus there are many interneurons and local connections, therefore npy will probably be secreted locally. however, even in the absence of staining in the projection areas one can not exclude that a projection neuron is releasing the neuropeptide elsewhere.

in order to circumvent that overexpression of a neuropeptide gene generates multiple messages and that the peptide may be released at distant sites, we developed an aav vector based method to overcome these problems. in short, we fused a signal peptide with ha tag and furin site to the cdna of a specific minigene, namely agrp83- <dig> or α-msh. to prevent trafficking of the minigene into the regulated secretion pathway we removed the n-terminal part of agrp or only used the msh sequence and made a construct in which a signal peptide from the von willebrand factor  was used to enter the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . a furin cleavage site was inserted between the signal peptide-ha tag and the minigene to release the minigene from the signal peptide. furin is a ubiquitously expressed pc which is located in the tgn, in stead of in secretory vesicles, and cycles back and forth to the plasma membrane  <cit> . we used the cdna of agrp83- <dig> as a minigene, because this is the main secreted form of agrp after processing by pc  <cit> . agrp is an inverse agonist for the mc3r and mc4r and stimulates food intake and reduces energy expenditure, while α-msh is a peptide derived from the pomc gene and is able to activate the mc3r and mc4r to inhibit food intake and increase energy expenditure  <cit> . agrp and α-msh compete to bind to the mc4r and the balance between these peptides determines the activity of the mc4r.

RESULTS
vwf-agrp83- <dig> and vwf-αmsh are secreted and biologically active
to investigate if peptides produced from constructs with a vwf signal peptide followed by a cleavage site and a neuropeptide are secreted and are biologically active, we tested whether the medium of cells transfected with the vwf-agrp83- <dig> constructs was able to antagonize the mc4r. the ability of the vwf-agrp83- <dig> to shift the ndp-msh dose reponse curve to the right was compared to a construct encoding for full length agrp, containing the normal agrp signal peptide. activation of mc4r in vitro results in an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate  <cit> . in our assay upregulation of camp increased lacz expression through a camp responsive element.

addition of ndp-msh to mc4r and cre-lacz transfected cells resulted in a dose response curve with an ec <dig> value of  <dig>  nm . another control was the addition of forskolin to mc4r_cre-lacz transfected cells . forskolin directly activates adenylyl cyclase, thereby increasing camp . when supernatants of gfp transfected cells were added together with different concentrations of npd-msh to mc4r_cre-lacz transfected cells, the dose response curve did not alter. however, addition of supernatants of flagrp or vwf-agrp83- <dig> transfected cells shifted the ndp-msh dose response curve to the right. the ec <dig> decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively when 10% of the volume added was supernatant . when 50% of the volume added to the mc4r_cre-lacz cells was supernatant from flagrp or vwf-agrp83- <dig> the ndp-msh dose response curve shifted even further to the right . in order to determine the amount of secreted agrp protein, supernatants were analyzed on a spot blot . this blot showed that  <dig> -fold less agrp was secreted from the vwf-agrp83- <dig> transfected cells compared to flagrp transfected cells, even though the transfection efficiencies were similar.

to check if monomeric vwf-αmsh <dig> and polymeric vwf-αmsh <dig> were able to activate the mc4r, different dilutions of supernatants from cells transfected with these constructs were added to mc4r_cre-lacz transfected cells. supernatants of both constructs activated the mc4r, with the polymeric vwf-αmsh <dig> being more potent. the polymeric vwf-αmsh <dig> reached 50% of mc4r activation at a dilution of  <dig> times, while vwf-αmsh <dig> already reached 50% activation of mc4-r after  <dig>  times dilution. the supernatant of gfp transfected cells was not able to activate the mc4r .

localization of flagrp and vwf-agrp83- <dig> in primary neurons
we compared the localization of agrp in primary cortical neurons which were infected with aav-flagrp or aav-vwf-agrp83- <dig> to check if aav-vwf-agrp83- <dig> entered the regulated secretion pathway. three days after infection the primary cortical neurons were stained for agrp. in addition, β-tubulin-iii was used to stain the cytoskeleton of neurons and dapi to identify the cell nucleus. neurons transduced with aav-flagrp, which contained the endogenous signal peptide to target agrp into the regulated secretory pathways, showed agrp immunostaining in their cell bodies and their branches. in contrast, aav-vwf-agrp83- <dig> transduced neurons only showed agrp immunostaining in the cell bodies and almost no staining in the branches . we did not observe gfp signal without gfp immunostaining.

behavioral effects of aav-vwf-agrp83- <dig> 
to further prove the functionality of aav-vwf-agrp83- <dig> , this virus was also injected in the pvn of rats. one μl containing  <dig> ×  <dig> genomic copies of aav-vwf-agrp83- <dig> or aav-gfp  was injected in the pvn . in situ hybridization against gfp showed that the pvn was transduced . overexpression of aav-vwf- agrp83- <dig> increased daily food intake when compared to titer matched aav-gfp injected rats  . in addition, the aav-vwf-agrp83- <dig> rats showed a significant increase in body weight gain compared to aav-gfp rats  from day  <dig> until day  <dig> post injection .

discussion
we here successfully demonstrate a novel approach to locally overexpress a individual neuropeptide rather than a whole neuropeptide precursor. this was achieved by fusing a neuropeptide minigene to the vwf signal peptide in a raav vector. we demonstrated that the neuropeptide minigene was released from the cell body and did not enter the regulated secretory pathway in vitro. in addition, we showed that the delivery of the neuropeptide minigene, using aav, to neurons of the pvn resulted in an increased food intake and body weight. this demonstrated that this method to deliver agrp locally in the brain was effective.

previous studies have shown that specific signal peptides could route a protein to the regulated pathway. fusion of gfp to npy or insulin signal sequence was sufficient to route gfp to regulated secretory granules and resulted in gfp secretion at axon terminals  <cit> . in addition, other groups have already showed that a secretory signal peptide can be used to direct constitutive peptide secretion from an aav vector in the rat brain  <cit> . in this study we showed that it is also possible to route peptides into the constitutive secretion pathway resulting in secretion by the cell body, through the use of the vwf signal peptide and an agrp fragment that lacked the n terminal part. we replaced the endogenous signal peptide, n-terminal part and cleavage site for a vwf signal peptide and a canonical proteolytic cleavage site for furin. normally the vwf is processed in endothelial cells, however aav transduces mainly neurons. therefore, after the vwf signal peptide a furin recognition site  was inserted, this to ensure that the vwf signal peptide was cleaved from agrp83- <dig> in neurons. probably the removal of the n-terminal part of the agrp gene has resulted to constitutive secretion, since it is suggested that the n-terminal part of prohormone neuropeptides in involved in the sorting to the secretory or constitutive pathway. to obtain long term expression of the neuropeptide minigenes we embedded these dna constructs in an raav vector. during our study a paper was published which described a method to deliver two gene products, gfp and galanin, from one raav vector  <cit> . they placed a furin sequence between the two genes and the first gene was fused to a fibronectin secretory signal peptide to establish constitutive secretion. this confirmed the feasibility of using furin as a cleavage site.

first we investigated if the vectors with the vwf signal peptide are secreted into the medium and compared this with a vector with its endogenous signal peptide.

the mc4r_cre-lacz assay showed that vwf-agrp83- <dig> and vwf-αmsh <dig> and vwf-αmsh <dig> were secreted by 293t cells into the culture medium. the secreted peptides were also biologically active since the medium could, respectively, inhibit or activate the mc4r. the medium of cells transfected with flagrp vector, containing the endogenous agrp signal peptide, also inhibited the mc4r. however, the inhibition by flagrp was stronger than the inhibition caused by medium from vwf-agrp83- <dig> transfected cells. after the mc4r assay we determined the amount of protein secreted in the medium of the cells. this revealed that there was  <dig>  fold less agrp immunoreactivity in the medium of vwf-agrp83- <dig> transfected cells than in the medium of flagrp. the difference in potency between vwf-agrp83- <dig> and flagrp to antagonize ndp-msh,  <dig>  versus  <dig>  nm respectively, is in the range which we expected, since a study by creemers et. al. showed that agrp83- <dig> was  <dig>  fold more potent than flagrp in inhibiting the mc4r  <cit> . thus, given the amount of peptide release  and potencies  our results are in agreement with the study by creemers et al. that vwf-agrp83- <dig> is  <dig> times more potent than flagrp.

medium from cells transfected with aav-vwf-αmsh <dig> was more potent in activating mc4r_cre-lacz than medium from aav-vwf-αmsh <dig> transfected cells. medium from gfp transfected cells was not able to stimulate mc4r_cre-lacz. these data are in agreement with previous data  <cit> .

in addition, we compared the localization of flagrp and vwf-agrp83- <dig> in primary neuronal cultures. these results showed that flagrp was expressed in the cell body and in the projections and that vwf-agrp83- <dig> was only expressed in the cell body and not in the projections. these results were in agreement with the expectation: peptides coupled to the vwf signal peptide and lacking the n-terminal part of agrp entered the constitutive secretion pathway and the one coupled to the endogenous agrp signal peptide plus n-terminal part entered the regulated secretion pathway in axons.

as a proof of principle we showed that unilateral overexpression with the vwf-agrp83- <dig> aav vector in a target area of agrp neurons, the pvn, increased food intake. this showed that the vwf-agrp83- <dig> is also functional in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that it is possible to overexpress a single neuropeptide derived from a large precursor and establish long term release, local to the transduced area, through the use of a vwf signal peptide.
