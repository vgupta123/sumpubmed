BACKGROUND
plants are constantly challenged by a large number of different pathogens with diverse infection strategies. to avert these attacks, plants use different mechanisms consisting of active and passive defense lines. among the active defense mechanisms of plants, specific resistance genes  are key factors involved in so-called gene-for-gene interactions. plants harboring a resistance gene recognize specific avirulence  gene products that characterize particular genotypes of the pathogen  <cit> .

several r-genes have been isolated from a variety of plant species  <cit> . the majority of r-genes encode nucleotide-binding site  and leucine-rich repeat  proteins  <cit> . on the basis of their n-terminal domains, the nbs-lrr resistance genes can be subdivided into two classes. the first class encodes proteins with an n-terminal tir domain , whereas the second class encodes proteins with coiled-coils , sometimes in the form of a leucine zipper  at the n-terminus of the protein  <cit> . two basic strategies for pathogen recognition are currently thought to exist: direct recognition of avr-gene products by r-proteins and indirect recognition via sensing perturbations of host proteins   <cit> . different domains of the nbs-lrr r-genes have been shown to be involved in pathogen recognition, but most studies indicate that the lrr domain plays the most important role in pathogen recognition  <cit> .

most of the r-genes described to date are organized in clusters reviewed in  <cit> . this clustering may facilitate r-gene diversity in the course of adaptation to counteract newly emerging avr-protein variants in newly evolving virulent races of a pathogen.

extensive studies have been conducted to understand the mechanism of r-gene diversification, mainly in herbaceous annual plants, such as for rp <dig> in maize  <cit> , cf4/cf <dig> and mi- <dig> in tomato  <cit> , xa <dig> in rice  <cit> , dm <dig>  in lettuce  <cit> , rpp <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> , n in flax  <cit>  and r <dig> in potato  <cit> . sequence analyses from these studies indicate that r-genes display significantly higher rates of sequence evolution than other plant genes. furthermore, lrr domains generally evolve more rapidly than the other domains of nbs-lrr genes and often display signs of positive selection. tandem and segmental gene duplications, recombination, unequal crossing over, point mutations and diversifying selection have been shown to contribute to r-gene diversity. recent r-gene sequence analyses in arabidopsis, maize, tomato, barley, lettuce, rice and wheat further indicated illegitimate recombination  as a major source of duplications and deletions  <cit> . illegitimate recombination is a type of recombination between two dna molecules which are not necessarily homologous to each other but share a few identical sequences. these identical sequences are called illegitimate recombination signatures. illegitimate recombination may result in duplications or deletions  <cit> .

unlike herbaceous annuals, woody perennial species are characterized not only by long-lived individual plants but also by longer average generation times than annuals. therefore, the nature of r-gene diversification could vary from that of annual plants. some perennial plant species, such as roses, propagate clonally as well as sexually via seeds. these different forms of reproduction could also contribute to a possible deviation in r-gene diversity in perennials, as differences in evolutionary rates between annuals and perennials have been noted several times  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying such differences are still unknown. more frequent and recent duplications of r-genes have been described in poplar and grapevine compared with rice and arabidopsis <cit> , indicating different evolutionary patterns of r-genes between perennial and annual plants.

roses are attacked by a number of pathogens and pests  <cit> , among which black spot is the most severe disease of field-grown roses. it is caused by the hemibiotrophic ascomycete diplocarpon rosae, for which a number of pathogenic races have been identified  <cit> . resistance to black spot has been found to be caused by both quantitative and qualitative resistance genes  <cit> , with the single dominant r-gene rdr <dig> from r. multiflora being the best studied rose r-gene thus far  <cit> .

recently, rdr <dig> was finely mapped to a telomeric position in rose linkage group  <dig> in a contig of four overlapping bac clones and isolated via map-based cloning  <cit> . the rdr <dig> gene is a tir-nbs-lrr  type resistance gene and a member of a multigene family of nine highly similar genes clustered in a region of  <dig>  kb in r. multiflora.

here, we present sequence information from the rdr <dig> locus of a second rose species, r. rugosa, and analyze the sequence conservation of this locus and the tnl family within roses. furthermore, we analyze synteny with other rosaceae, represented by sequences from strawberry, peach and apple, and with members of other plant families.

RESULTS
comparison of the rdr <dig> contig between r. multiflora and r. rugosa
in addition to the previously published sequence of a  <dig> -kb region spanning the rdr <dig> locus of r. multiflora, a set of four overlapping bac clones spanning the rdr <dig> region in r. rugosa was sequenced with roche  <dig> sequencing. the sequences were assembled to a total length of  <dig>  bp, with individual sizes of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb for the bac clones 31c <dig>  95g <dig>  78f <dig> and 35d <dig>  respectively. the complete sequence has been deposited in genbank . the first  <dig>  bp from the r. rugosa sequence extended beyond the left end of the corresponding r. multiflora homologous bac-clone 29o <dig> 

ab initio gene prediction revealed  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> of which displayed significant similarities to entries in the genbank database . among the  <dig> predicted genes, eleven are tnl genes with a high dna sequence similarity  to the already characterized rdr <dig> tnl family, and nine are transposable elements . we designated the  <dig> tnl genes as rurdr <dig> a through rurdr1k, where ‘ru’ stands for the species name of the source of the sequence , and ‘a’ to ‘k’ indicates the order of the tnl gene in the sequenced contig. a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> tnl sequences exhibit uninterrupted predicted coding sequences. we also observed several truncated tnl genes distributed throughout the cluster. most of these fragments share similarities to lrr domains, and some are attached to retroelements. six of the transposable elements belong to the group of long terminal repeat  retrotransposons; two belong to the non-long terminal repeats  retrotransposons; and one belongs to the mutator-like transposase type of dna transposons.

gene predictions were made using fgenesh and blast.

similar to the previously described r. multiflora tnls  <cit> , the size of the genomic sequences of the r. rugosa tnls varies from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. the rurdr1b tnl carries an additional 1904-bp sequence of unknown function in the third intron . most of the tnl homologs are comprised of four exons and three introns with few homologs having five exons that correspond to the tir, nbs, nll , lrr and post-lrr domains, respectively .

the additional sequence that extends the r. rugosa contig beyond the borders of the r. multiflora contig contains two tnl elements  as well as two transposable elements and sequences with similarity to a neuroblastoma amplified gene, a major facilitator superfamily domain and a rhodanese-like domain-containing protein.

gata alignment and dot plot comparison of the  <dig> -kb region from r. multiflora and the  <dig> -kb region from r. rugosa indicates a high degree of synteny between the two species .

a group of nine sequences  at the right end of the r. multiflora contig and a sequence stretch comprising a predicted gene for a vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein and transcription factor at the left end of the contig are perfectly conserved between the two species. however, the region between these sequences exhibits several copy number changes, inversions and deletions/insertions. of the  <dig> tnl genes located on the r. rugosa contig, nine are in the same and two are in a reverse orientation compared with the r. multiflora contig in which all of the tnl genes are in the same orientation. for some of the non-tnl genes, differences are observed in terms of the relative location and the number of homologs within each cluster. furthermore, some sequences are completely missing in one cluster and present in another. for example, a 23-kb region with similarity to prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha, aminotransferase-like, wuschel protein terminator and inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase is present in the homologous locus in r. multiflora but absent in the r. rugosa locus.

in addition, the transposable elements distributed over the two contigs differ both in their position and sequence. the ten transposable elements in the r. multiflora locus belong to the ty1/copia type retroelements, whereas the r. rugosa locus contains ty1/copia as well as other different retroelements.

conservation of the locus within the rosaceae
among the plant species with sequenced genomes, the strawberry is the closest relative to the genus rosa. we therefore compared the r. multiflora contig to sequences from fragaria vesca. we subjected individual sequences from the rdr <dig> contig to blast searches against the fragaria genome sequence and located a stretch of similar sequences of approximately  <dig> kb from strawberry chromosome  <dig> between positions  <dig> , <dig> bp and  <dig> , <dig> bp. several insertions, deletions and large rearrangements in the form of inversions and translocations were found . the cluster of conserved genes from the right and the left sides of the r. multiflora contig are also found in fragaria. twelve tnl genes with high similarity to the rdr <dig> gene family  are also located in the selected fragaria sequence region. in the following analyses, we designate these genes as fvtnl <dig> through fvtnl <dig>  unlike at the r. multiflora locus, the orientation of the fragaria tnls varies, in that the majority of the genes are inverted relative to the r. multiflora copies. further differing from the r. multiflora locus, the genes within the conserved cluster from the right side of the contig, such as the yellow stripe-like gene and the ubiquitin fusion gene, are in an inverted position, inserted within the tnl genes.

the 354-kb fragaria sequence contains a stretch of  <dig>  kb of ambiguous sequence  resulting from problems in the assembly. this may lead to changes in the fragaria locus structure in the future, although this is unlikely.

in contrast to what is observed in fragaria, the rdr <dig> homologous locus is located on two different chromosomes in p. persica . the closest relatives to the rdr <dig> gene family are found in a cluster of  <dig> genes in linkage group  <dig> , whereas the genes flanking the tnl cluster at the right and left margins in rosa and fragaria are located in linkage group  <dig>  in prunus. the  <dig> prunus tnls are designated pptnl <dig> through pptnl <dig>  the cluster is characterized by large differences in terms of the non-tnl genes and the orientation of the tnls. in contrast, the flanking genes are highly conserved between rosa and prunus.

the similarity between rose and apple is comparable to the above-mentioned situation in peach, in which tnls and flanking genes are located in two different linkage groups . the closest relatives to the rdr <dig> tnls are located in a cluster of  <dig> genes in apple linkage group  <dig> spanning a position from  <dig> , <dig> bp to  <dig> , <dig> bp. hereafter, they are designated mdtnl <dig> through mdtnl <dig>  the flanking genes are located in linkage group  <dig> .

conservation of the locus in taxa outside of the rosaceae
the strong synteny of the rdr <dig> locus between rosa and fragaria and the low synteny with prunus and malus raise the question of whether the group of rdr <dig> tnl genes is present at a similar locus in other plant families. we defined synteny simply as close linkage of a tnl cluster with similarity to the rdr <dig> family to the flanking genes conserved among the rosoideae species.

the first species investigated was medicago truncatula, as the fabaceae are a family closely related to the rosaceae. we found some of the flanking genes of the right side of the contig distributed among more than three chromosomes in m. truncatula, but no tnl genes related to the rdr <dig> family are located close to that locus . we also did not detect the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein or transcription factor from the left side of the r. multiflora locus, indicating a lack of synteny in medicago. related tnl genes are found on several of the medicago chromosomes, but the similarity to the rdr <dig> family is too low to infer orthology relationships. the m. truncatula sequences utilized in these analyses are downloaded from http://www.medicagohapmap.org/.

we performed the same analysis in the arabidopsis thaliana genome, and again, no syntenic block of sequences could be detected . the flanking genes in this case also do not form a cluster at one location but are distributed on more than two chromosomes in more than two copies. the a. thaliana sequences utilized in these analyses are downloaded from http://www.arabidopsis.org/.

evolutionary history of the rdr <dig> tnl family
on the basis of our first analyses of the conservation of the structure of the rdr <dig> locus, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the tnl genes from the r. multiflora, r. rugosa and f. vesca contigs. in addition, we included all  <dig> peach and  <dig> apple genes clustered in linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. overall, the derived amino acid sequences of  <dig> full-length tnl genes were aligned , and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed with  <dig> bootstrap replicates .

the tree shows four major groups that are highly supported by bootstrap values of 99% to 100%. there is a distinct cluster  formed by rosa and fragaria, representing the subfamily rosoideae of the rosaceae, which is separated from a single malus sequence , a cluster  in which sequences from malus and prunus each form distinct subclusters and a cluster  comprised mainly of prunus sequences and two malus sequences in one subcluster . within the largest rosoideae cluster, sequences from rosa and fragaria each form distinct highly supported subclusters, indicating recent evolution of the rdr <dig> tnls after the genera diverged. within the subcluster comprised of the rose sequences, there is no separation of r. multiflora and r. rugosa sequences. instead, highly supported clusters with pairs of sequences from both species  and mixed subclusters with low bootstrap support indicate that some of the sequences evolved before the species separated. as an exception to this, the pair murdr1b/murdr1g shows almost no divergence, indicating a recent gene duplication in rosa multiflora.

in contrast to the divergence of sequences from rosa and fragaria, the rdr <dig> homologues in prunus and malus are mixed in clusters iii and iv. cluster iii is comprised of two subclusters , each including genes only from prunus or malus, in contrast to cluster iv, which consists of genes from both species. the branch lengths of subclusters iiia and iiib are shorter than the branch lengths of cluster iv, indicating that they evolved after prunus and malus diverged.

sequence evolution of the tnl family
to obtain additional information about the processes that led to the diversity of the rdr <dig> tnl genes, we analyzed the sequence variability of the genes in more detail.

analyses of nucleotide diversity  among the tnl genes from rosa ranged from  <dig>  between the closely related paralogs murdr1b and murdr1g  to  <dig>  between murdr1f and rurdr1g . the nucleotide diversity within the cluster of r. multiflora tnl genes is at approximately the same level as the average for the r. multiflora genes compared with the genes from r. rugosa. surprisingly, comparison of all r. multiflora tnl genes with the genes from the f. vesca cluster leads to only slightly higher values  than comparisons among the rose genes. in contrast, a comparison with the other two rosaceous genomes  leads to a sharp increase in the diversity, associated with an average π value of  <dig>  . if tnl and non-tnl genes from the orthologous regions are compared, the value is much higher than the average value for the conserved cluster of flanking genes  or the value for a randomly selected single-copy control gene  from an est collection . this indicates higher evolutionary rates for the tnl genes compared with other genes from the same locus or unlinked loci . the large variation in sequence similarity between the  <dig> rosaceae tnls obscured the obvious difference in diversity and led to a similar level of nucleotide diversity for the tir, nbs and lrr domains . a clear difference is observed between the tir, nbs and lrr domains when the more similar tnl genes from r. multiflora, r. rugosa and /or fragaria are compared , which is in line with previous reports in which the tir domain is the most conserved region, and the nbs and lrr domain regions are more diverse.

as several studies on the evolution of tnl genes in plants have indicated positive selection acting on the lrr region, we computed ka and ks values for the whole coding region of all  <dig> rose tnl genes. the overall mean ks values estimated using the modified nei and gojobori algorithm  <cit>  with jukes-cantor correction  <cit>  are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the tir, nbs and lrr domains, respectively. whereas the overall mean ka estimates are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the tir, nbs and lrr domains, respectively. recalculation over short sequences by dividing each of the domains into two to four parts revealed elevated ka over ks values for a few pairwise comparisons, particularly in the lrr region, which is indicative of positive selection . the number of comparisons with an elevated ka over ks increases from the tir to nbs domains, and the highest numbers occurred in the lrr domain region . this is in agreement with several previous studies, in which different ratios of ka to ks were found for the different subunits of the lrr domains, with the highest ratio of ka to ks observed for the solvent-exposed residues of the lrr subunit, which are speculated to determine resistance specificity  <cit> . the smallest ks and ka values are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, detected between the most similar rdr <dig> paralogs, murdr1b and murdr1g.

comparison of the  <dig> r. multiflora and r. rugosa tnls revealed several duplications and deletions distributed along the entire domain of the gene. similar to previous observations related to r-gene sequences in annual plant species  <cit> , illegitimate recombination  signatures are detected flanking eight duplications and indels . for example, an 'aat' fingerprint flanked the 27-bp repeat in the tir-encoding domain of rurdr1h; a 'cagag' fingerprint flanked the 18-bp repeat in the nbs-encoding domain of murdr1h; and an 'ac' fingerprint flanked the 16-bp repeat in the lrr-encoding domain of murdr1a . in most cases, the ir signatures are 100% identical.

approximately  <dig> polymorphic sites and  <dig> indels varying in length from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp are observed. the longest indel is in the microsatellite repeat region in exon  <dig>  some indels are duplications flanked by ir signatures resulting from unequal crossing over. the majority of indels are in the noncoding region of the tnl sequences.

analyses with geneconv  <cit>  uncovered  <dig> gene conversion tracts among the  <dig> tnls of r. multiflora and r. rugosa . tracts of 100% identical sequences are identified as an indication of sequence conversion. sequence conversion events were visually confirmed in different regions of the tnl genes.

discussion
the rdr <dig> locus is conserved within the rosa genus
we sequenced a genomic region of  <dig>  kb from r. rugosa orthologous to the recently published rdr <dig> gene cluster from r. multiflora. comparison of the two regions reveals a high degree of conservation of genes flanking a cluster of  <dig> tnl genes, but we also found rearrangements within the group of tnls. this corresponds to other studies in which major rearrangements, including deletions, gene duplications and inversions, have been found among groups of nbs-lrr genes  <cit> . the structure of the rdr <dig> locus indicates several mechanisms that have led to the above-mentioned structural differences between the two orthologous regions. the close relationships between the tnl genes, presenting dna similarities with between an 88% and 95% identity, might have led to unequal crossing over, resulting in some of the observed duplications/deletions. another factor promoting recombination at the rdr <dig> locus is the presence of transposable elements belonging to the ty1/copia class as well as non-ltr classes, which are present on both contigs. several authors have hypothesized that both the repetitive nature of various copies of retroposons and their capacity to transpose neighboring genes have likely contributed to the diversity of r-gene clusters  <cit> . the high variability detected among the tnl genes at the locus is also reflected in the large number of alleles for a microsatellite from the lrr region of the rdr <dig> gene family that has been analyzed in rose varieties, species and individuals from natural populations of the diploid species rosa arvensis <cit> .

the rdr <dig> locus is conserved between rosa and fragaria
comparing the rose rdr <dig> locus with a syntenic region of the fragaria genome revealed conservation of the flanking genes as well as the presence of the rdr <dig> tnl gene family. this finding is in agreement with synteny studies conducted with molecular markers showing that the region on rose chromosome  <dig> to which we mapped rdr <dig> is syntenic to fragaria chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . it also indicates that a cluster of tnl genes with similarity to the rdr <dig> tnls existed prior to the separation of the tribe rosa  from the potentilleae . apart from the flanking genes and the presence of tnls with high similarity to the rdr <dig> family, large structural changes occurred, in that many non-tnl genes found in rose do not match similar genes in strawberry and vice versa. as the two species belong to separate tribes, this is not surprising, given the variability that we detected between the two rose species. the mechanisms leading to these differences are likely the same mechanisms that shaped the differences within the genus rosa.

the rdr <dig> locus is not conserved between rosa, prunus and malus
in contrast to the conservation of the rdr <dig> locus in fragaria, no conservation of the tnl cluster is found in malus and prunus. although the flanking genes are conserved as a tightly linked group in both malus and prunus, there are no closely linked tnls, as observed in fragaria. rather, the closest relatives to the rose rdr <dig> family are detected in clusters on separate chromosomes. as conservation is also lacking in medicago and arabidopsis, one possible conclusion is that the tnls were inserted at their present location after the rosoideae and spiraeoideae split. although errors during whole genome sequencing and assembly cannot be excluded  <cit> , the cause of this transposition is difficult to infer. however, the presence of mobile genetic elements is one possible explanation. comparative analysis of an nbs-lrr cluster in phaseolus vulgaris and other fabaceae indicates that subtelomeric positions are prone to transpositions of repeated dna elements  <cit> . this might be the case for the rdr <dig> locus split in spiraeoideae, as the rdr <dig> tnl clusters are located at a telomeric position in the rose chromosome  <dig> map  <cit> . in contrast to the situation in phaseolus, we have no evidence that any sequence closely related to the rdr <dig> family maps outside the cluster on linkage group  <dig>  mapping experiments in two diploid and one tetraploid mapping population reveal that all polymorphic fragments are linked in one region on linkage group  <dig>  although they spread over a distance of up to  <dig> cm .

phylogenetic analyses
phylogenetic analyses  led to a dendrogram that was highly supported by bootstrap values above 80%, in which the rose and fragaria genes form separate clusters, whereas the malus and prunus genes are located in mixed clusters. none of the fragaria genes clustered with any of the rose genes, which form clusters according to the two different rose species.

this indicates that although the tnl genes most likely translocated to their current positions after the separation of the rosoideae and the spiraeoideae, the locus underwent further independent evolution in each of the genera. this is consistent with the observation of high similarity among the dna sequences within each cluster, indicating that individual members of the gene families arose relatively recently. explanations for this situation have been proposed in a number of other studies on r-genes and involve the evolution of r-gene clusters via duplications and deletions of family members and through gene conversion  <cit> . the discrepancy of tnl genes in woody plants forming clusters of highly similar genes while tnl genes are generally phylogenetically old, predating the split between gymnosperms and angiosperms, has been noted previously  <cit> . studies on the sequenced genomes of grapevine and poplar compared with rice and arabidopsis indicate that most clustered tnl genes from woody perennials are of a more recent origin than genes from annual plant species  <cit> . one explanation for this observation is the lower number of generations in woody perennials compared with annuals, which is also held responsible for the generally lower rate of molecular evolution in protein coding genes  <cit> . within cluster i of the dendrogram, the rose subclusters include genes from both species , indicating that these copies existed before the species separated. there are only three exceptions to this pattern, among which the gene pair murdr1b and murdr1g indicates a very recent duplication event, as the two genes are almost identical. subclusters iiia and iiib harboring genes from malus  and prunus  indicate phylogenetic relationships similar to the rosa and fragaria subclusters in that they only include genes from one of the species, which indicates that the genes evolved after prunus and malus diverged. the shorter average branch lengths of these clusters compared with all other subclusters indicates that these two groups of genes are the ones that evolved most recently.

analysis of evolutionary rates
enhanced rates of nucleotide diversity are a major factor in the evolutionary dynamics of nb-lrr resistance genes  <cit> . we therefore analyzed both tnl and non-tnl genes across rose, strawberry, apple and peach. in line with the topology of the phylogenetic tree, low values for nucleotide diversity were observed among the rosoideae  compared with the other rosaceae . however, if we consider the higher rates of evolution among the tnl compared with the non-tnl genes, it is somewhat surprising how closely related the fragaria tnl genes are to the rosa tnl genes . this emphasizes the very close phylogenetic relationship between roses and strawberries, which belong to the same subfamily and the same supertribe of the rosaceae, which is also reflected in the high degree of macrosynteny found in their chromosome structure  <cit> . although the rosaceae tnl genes seem to be of relatively recent origin, their nucleotide diversity is more than two-fold higher when compared with the values for the cluster of flanking genes and an arbitrarily chosen gene . this has been observed in several nbs-lrr gene clusters and most likely reflects selective advantages due to higher rates of sequence evolution, which accelerate the evolution of new resistance specificities  <cit> . for many r-gene clusters, positive selection, indicated by ka/ks ratios of greater than  <dig> , particularly in the lrr regions, has been postulated  <cit> . we also found increased ka/ks ratios in the lrr regions of rose rdr <dig> tnls. however, in contrast to other studies in which a dramatic increase of ka/ks values has been observed in lrr regions, we found only moderate increases in the lrr region. this difference might be due to the overall lower rate of sequence evolution observed in perennial plants because of more recent duplications. alternatively it might be caused by a lower rate of positive selection on the rose rdr <dig> gene family. there is initial evidence that the rdr1-tnl cluster includes several resistance genes against black spot and that the evolution of new pathogenic races in black spot is slow due to mostly asexual reproduction and low gene flow  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses indicate illegitimate recombination, gene conversion, unequal crossing over, indels, point mutations and transposable elements as mechanisms involved in the evolution of the rdr <dig> locus in rose. it is well documented that similar factors play a role in resistance gene diversity in several annual plant species. therefore, the diversifying mechanisms associated with the rdr <dig> locus of the perennial, clonally propagated rose are principally comparable to those of annual plant species, although the rdr <dig> tnls are further characterized by recent duplication.

analyses of other tnl-type resistance genes in rosaceae, for example, the recently cloned ma gene from prunus cerasifera <cit> , may provide additional information if the pattern of rdr1-tnl evolution is universal for all tnl genes of perennials or specific to the rose rdr <dig> alone.

the rdr <dig> locus is highly conserved within the genus rosa and somewhat less conserved between rosa and fragaria; nevertheless, the synteny is disturbed when compared with malus and prunus, possibly due to recombination and chromosome translocation aided by transposable elements.

in the rosoideae, tnl gene diversification occurred before and after the split of rosa and fragaria. a similar phenomenon took place in the spiraeoideae between prunus and malus tnl genes, indicating that most tnl genes in the rosaceae arose relatively recently.
