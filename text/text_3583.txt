BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  are the most important apc that play a crucial role in bridging innate resistance and adaptive immunity  <cit> . immature dcs reside in peripheral tissues, where they release soluble mediators  that participate in innate inflammatory responses during infection  <cit> . upon capturing antigens, dcs migrate to the lymph nodes and present processed antigenic epitopes to t cells, resulting in their activation and further expansion  <cit> . a variety of signals induce dc maturation. mature dcs express high levels of antigen presenting and co-stimulatory molecules and certain cytokines critical for the nature of the t cell response. for instance, th1-type t cell responses need inflammatory il- <dig> produced by dcs. conversely, dcs can also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig>  <cit> , which influences the dc maturation process by down-regulating il- <dig> production and thus interfering with the th1-type t cell responses  <cit> . moreover, il-10-producing dcs also promote immune tolerance by modulating the suppressive effects of regulatory t cells  <cit> . accordingly, there has been considerable interest in influencing the dc maturation process to direct t cell responses to a desired type  for translational purposes.

a useful system for the study of dcs in culture is the use of monocyte-derived dcs obtained in vitro by gm-csf and ril- <dig> treatment of peripheral cd14+ monocytes. these cells can produce high amounts of cytokines such as il- <dig> and il- <dig> when stimulated with lps  <cit> . some evidence suggests an involvement of src-family tyrosine kinases  in the signaling pathway triggered by lps. in monocytes, lps activates the src-family kinase lyn associated with cd <dig>  a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol -anchored molecule that cooperates with toll-like receptor  <dig>  in lps binding on the surface of these cells  <cit> . however, the complexity in the engagement of tlrs by lps leading to interactions with intracellular adaptor proteins and their associated kinases is still under investigation.

shc adaptor proteins are substrates of receptor tyrosine kinases, and signal events initiated by their phosphorylation culminate in erk and jnk activation  <cit> . among the three related shc genes, shca is ubiquitously expressed, whereas shcb and shcc are restricted to cells of neural origin, and we describe shca here as shc based on this tissue restriction. shc is expressed as three isoforms of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda derived from shca via post-transcriptional splicing, which display the ptb-ch1-sh <dig> shc family signature, with an added n-terminal ch <dig> domain in p66shca and a truncated ptb domain in p46shca. the ptb and sh <dig> domains both bind tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides and associate with activated receptor kinases  <cit> . recently, it has been found that the defects of pp66shca in t cells of p66shca-/- mice display enhanced proliferative responses to t-cell antigen receptor  agonists, suggesting a potential role of p66shca in lymphocyte homeostasis  <cit> . the p66shca-/- mice also develop a lupus-like autoimmune disease, which implies a possible key role of p66shca in regulating immunologic tolerance and the development of systemic autoimmunity. however, there has been no definite evidence of a role for shc proteins in dc maturation, cytokine production or the expression of co-stimulatory molecules triggered by lps.

in the present study, we briefly address the role of shc proteins in the maturation process triggered by lps in rat bone marrow-derived dcs, and we evaluate their contribution in the context of lps-induced tlr <dig> signaling.

RESULTS
transient activation and sustained induction of shc proteins
to test whether lps can activate shc, bone marrow-derived dcs were treated with  <dig>  Î¼g/ml lps for  <dig> hrs. when dendritic cells obtained from lew rats were cultured with rgm-csf and ril- <dig>  p46shc and p52shc were expressed in immature dcs, but the inducible form of p66shc was not observed, as shown by western blot analysis . at  <dig> h after the addition of endotoxin, the expression of p66shc was induced, and the accumulation of p52shc was also increased. however, no significant change was observed in p46shc accumulation.

shc phosphorylation mechanisms were also examined in the lps-induced maturation of dcs. figure 1b shows that p52shc protein was transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine residues 239/ <dig> but not  <dig>  we further evaluated whether the addition of anti-shc mab could block the phosphorylation events of shc in dcs exposed to lps. as shown in figure 1b, the lps-induced transient phosphorylation of shc protein in yy239/ <dig> was down-regulated by 24-h preincubation of anti-shc monoclonal antibody. this result suggests that the anti-shc mab we used could act as a blocking antibody for shc neutralization. moreover, we evaluated the role of non-receptor src-family kinases  in shc phosphorylation by using a small molecule src-family kinase inhibitor su <dig> while dcs was exposed to lps. the inhibition of shc phosphorylation by su <dig> indicating the involvement of sfks activity in lps-triggered shc signaling events. therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation on positions 239/ <dig> of shc is src-dependent.

effect of shc silencing on the response of dcs to lps exposure
to evaluate the role of shc proteins in dc cytokine production, a neutralizing anti-shc mab was added to immature dcs, which concomitantly treated with lps for  <dig> h. as shown in figure  <dig>  incubation of dcs with anti-shc mab but not with control mouse igg in the presence of lps for  <dig> h elicited a lower level of il- <dig> secretion . to determine whether the endogenous shc directly involved in lps-induced il- <dig> production, the shc sirna was used. shc sirna dose-dependently inhibited the expression of shc mrna expression . figure 2c also shows that lps-induced il- <dig> production was inhibited by shc sirna. decreased secretion of il- <dig> by  <dig> -fold in dcs stimulated with lps and concomitantly with transfected shc sirna .

in addition to il- <dig>  lps induces dc production of various cytokines, including il- <dig> and il- <dig>  therefore, the homeostasis of inflammation versus immune suppression controlled by dcs via the balance of produced cytokines would be crucial, so we determined the role of shc in il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion. dcs were treated with lps  for  <dig> h in the presence of transfected shc sirna  or neg. sirna , and the secretion of il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> in the supernatant were measured by elisa. the mrna expression of il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> was also determined by quantitative rt-pcr. we found that lps induced substantial secretion of il- <dig> and increased expression of il- <dig> mrna by dcs. notably, the lps-induced production of il- <dig> was significantly enhanced in the presence of shc sirna . in contrast, cultured dcs showed vigorous secretion of il-12p <dig> and mrna expression of il-12p <dig> in response to lps treatment, while the il- <dig> levels were significantly suppressed by shc sirna . therefore, shc-mediated signaling appears to be crucial for regulation of il- <dig> and il- <dig> production by dcs upon lps stimulation.

enhanced expression of t cell co-stimulatory molecule cd <dig> on shc-silenced dcs in response to lps exposure
dcs undergo a maturation process while the host detects a microbial infection, which enhances their ability to process and present exogenous antigen. optimal antigen presentation of dcs requires the expression of specific membrane protein markers. maturation of dcs is associated with profound changes in the surface phenotype of protein markers, including an up-regulated expression of co-stimulatory and mhc class ii molecules  <cit> . during maturation, the co-stimulatory molecules  are required for t cell priming and produce cytokines that direct t cell differentiation, whereas processed antigen fragments are present to the surface using mhc-ii molecules. in order to evaluate the effects of shc blockade on co-stimulatory and mhc class ii molecules during dc maturation, the immature dcs were transfected with shc sirna prior to lps treatment and the surface protein expression was measured by flow cytometry. cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc-ii protein levels were increased significantly in dcs expose to lps for  <dig> h. moreover, we found that dcs treated with lps for  <dig> h with transfected shc sirna display enhanced level of cd <dig> , but not cd <dig> or mhc-ii , indicating that cd <dig> was selectively enhanced during lps-triggered maturation with shc blockade.

lps-induced stat <dig> phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are highly enhanced by shc silencing in dcs
we further investigated stat <dig> phosphorylation in lps-induced dcs with or without shc blockade. as shown in figure  <dig>  stat <dig> was highly phosphorylated at  <dig> h in lps-stimulated dcs, and its phosphorylation was almost down to basal after  <dig> h. the phosphorylation level of stat <dig> was significantly enhanced in dcs transfected with shc sirna but not neg. sirna. moreover, the involvement of lps-induced il- <dig> secretion was also examined by using il- <dig> neutralizing antibody . our data suggests the lps-induced stat <dig> activation and the enhanced stat <dig> activation via shc blockade are il- <dig> dependent. furthermore, su <dig> totally abolished the induced stat <dig> phosphorylation indicating the involvement of sfks activity in stat <dig> activation of lps-stimulated dcs.

the nuclear translocation of phospho-stat <dig> was measured. as shown in figure  <dig>  shc blockade promotes nuclear localization of phospho-stat <dig>  stat <dig> was detected mainly in the cytosolic fraction of dcs with a variety of treatment conditions. the relative phosphorylation levels of stat <dig> in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions were increased by lps treatment for  <dig> h. moreover, the relative phosphorylation level of stat <dig> in the nuclear fraction  but not in the cytosol  was highly enhanced by lps treatment with shc blockade. this result indicates that more stat <dig> phosphorylated on tyr- <dig> is generated into the nucleus in lps-induced dcs with shc blockade. the activation of stat <dig> by lps with or without shc blockade was totally abolished by su <dig> both in n and c fractions.

discussion
we show that expression of shc proteins was induced by lps and that shc blockade inhibited lps-primed phosphorylation of p52shc on tyrosine residues. il- <dig> and il- <dig> production triggered by lps were suppressed by shc blockade. moreover, the expressions of costimulatory molecule cd <dig> and of il- <dig> were enhanced while silencing endogenous shc on lps-induced dcs. however, the lps-induced il- <dig> production would be totally abolished in the presence of su <dig>  implying that the signals transducing via adaptor protein shc negatively regulate the il- <dig> expression and underscoring the complexity of the role of sfks.

adaptive immunity evolved from an ancient innate defense mechanism common to most microorganisms. therefore, it is not surprising that sensing and signal transduction in innate immunity is the starting point of the specific immune response. apcs, such as macrophages/monocytes and dcs, activated by various antigens of bacteria  <cit>  and other microorganisms  <cit>  through toll-like receptors , could be central to this process that integrates innate information and conveys it to lymphocytes  <cit> . adaptor proteins differ from other signaling molecules in their lack of inherent catalytic activity, but they are primarily composed of modular domains that bind and act as scaffolds for the organization of macromolecular complexes, and they recruit other signaling proteins for correct localization. they play important roles in the integration and propagation of signals that lead to lymphocyte development and homeostasis  <cit> . therefore, the mechanisms underlying tlr-mediated activation of apcs have been extensively analyzed, but the downstream signaling pathways governing the release of inflammatory mediators in response to lps are yet to be understood.

the lps-stimulated secretion of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines requires the recruitment of intracellular adaptor molecules. for example, myeloid differentiation primary response gene  <dig>  is recruited to activate the nf-Îºb and mapk pathways via tnf receptor-associated factor  <dig>  and the il- <dig> receptor-associated kinases   <cit> , and a second pair of toll-il-1-resistance  domain-containing adaptors inducing interferon-beta  and trif-related adaptor molecule  induce signaling via traf <dig> and the interferon regulatory factors  to activate the interferon response  <cit> . however, there is growing evidence that other adaptor molecules could also make important contributions to the inflammatory responses. the role of p52shc in transducing signals for proliferative responses to tcr agonists has been reported  <cit>  and the negative regulation in t-cell and b-cell activation via p66shc using p66-/- mice has also been illustrated  <cit> .

the involvement of shc members in signaling pathways have been well characterized  <cit> . the ch <dig> domain has three tyrosine residues, 239/ <dig> and  <dig> in p52shc, which upon phosphorylation interact with grb <dig> and have been proposed to be differentially coupled to fos-dependent proliferation signaling  and to myc-dependent survival pathways  in b-cell  <cit>  and t-cell activation  <cit> . in the present study, we provide new insight into the role of shc in the maturation process triggered by lps in dc, and we evaluate their contribution in the context of lps-induced tlr <dig> signaling. the proximal signaling events occurring through shc in association with lps-induced maturation of dc were first defined. our study was based on the primary observation in accumulation of shc proteins after a 48-h lps treatment. strong suppression of il- <dig> and il- <dig> production by shc sirna as well as anti-shc mab in dc suggests the role of shc signaling in promoting the pro-inflammatory properties of lps-stimulated dc. however, the shc-silenced dc stimulated with lps also exhibited increased levels of costimulatory molecules and mhc ii antigen stimulation. this indicates that the tolerogenic state of lps-primed dc under shc silencing could be determined by unravel factors through il- <dig>  a cytokine which has also been found in contributing to hcg-induced tolerogenic phenotype of dc  <cit> . recently, the role of activated stat <dig> as the transcription factor induced by il- <dig> in tolerogenic dc was investigated  <cit> . dcs expressing activated stat <dig> produce less il-12p <dig> by inhibiting the recruitment but not activation of nf-Îºb subunits  <cit> . in this study, we found that shc blockade significantly enhances stat <dig> phosphorylation on tyrosine residue- <dig> and increases the nuclear localization of phospho-stat <dig> in a src-dependent manner. this finding establishes a novel signaling event for stat <dig> and associates its activation with a negative regulatory role for shc in tolerogenic properties of dc. furthermore, it has been found that the stat <dig> pathway is required for il-10-mediated down-regulation of inflammatory genes in monocytes by lps  <cit> , and stat <dig> phosphorylation is likely due to lps-induced il- <dig> secretion in dc, while no phospho-stat <dig> was observed in lps-stimulated il-10-/- bmdcs  <cit> . our results are consistent with these studies in that lps-induced stat <dig> phosphorylation was blocked by il- <dig> neutralization. lps-induced iÎºb degradation was not affected by shc blockade and src inhibitor su <dig> . in conjunction with a similar activation profile for erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> signaling events, these data suggest that lps-triggered src-shc signaling events are not involved directly in the signaling cascade which has been reported in causing increased il-12p <dig> gene expression via other adaptor proteins through mapk and nf-Îºb pathways  <cit> . the tlr-stimulated signaling cascades via activation of transcription factors nf-Îºb, ap- <dig> and irf <dig>  results in the expression of "innate" genes involved in pro-inflammatory properties of mature dc were not determined by src-family kinase activity. however, the pro-inflammatory properties of mature dc were directed to th <dig> phenotype and determined by src-mediated stat <dig> activation while shc was blocked.

furthermore, shc proteins are key components of the pathways that activate downstream signaling molecules of growth factor receptors, extracellular matrix proteins and mechanical forces  <cit> , and have been revealed a role in inflammatory signaling with increased ecm binding  <cit> . a recent study also showed that lps-induced dc is enriched in mhc-ii antigen and intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig>  in the vesicular compartment called exosomes  <cit> . the enriched mhc-ii and icam- <dig> are required for mature dc to prime naÃ¯ve t cells representing the immunogenic activity of lps-treated dcs. we briefly found that co-immunoprecipitation of p52shc and icam- <dig> in lps-treated dcs  implying the involvement of adhesion molecules via shc in modulating the immunogenic and tolerogenic properties of mature dc. however, the detailed mechanisms for the interplay of extracellular matrix, adaptor proteins as well as specific sfks are critical in the regulation of dc-mediated immune response and require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we propose a model where the lps-primed mature dc produce high level of il- <dig> as well as nuclear transactivation of src-mediated phospho-stat <dig> while shc-mediated signaling is blocked. our findings suggest that the balance of inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines generated by dcs upon tlr stimulation could be critically determined by shc, which may act like a switch in response to subsequently acquired immunity.
