BACKGROUND
to address an increasingly severe energy crisis and its environmental consequences, biofuels and biochemicals generated from renewable resources, as a source of fossil fuels and chemicals, could serve as promising alternatives for petroleum  <cit> . isoprene becomes increasingly important as a vital platform chemical for the production of synthetic rubber  <cit>  and aviation fuel  <cit> .

so far, dimethylallyl diphosphate, the precursor of isoprene can be produced mainly through two different pathways, the methylerythritol 4-phosphate  pathway and mevalonate  pathway  <cit> , which have already been adopted by different research groups for the biosynthesis of isoprene in e. coli . the data show that mva pathway is more effective in the isoprene production than the mep pathway because of the regulatory mechanisms for the mep pathway present in the native host  <cit> .

isoprene biosynthesis using the mva pathway requires eight reactions that are catalyzed by seven or eight enzymes encoded by two operons. one operon consists of the genes erg <dig>  erg <dig> and thmgr from saccharomyces cerevisiae or mvae and mvas from enterococcus faecalis. this operon catalyzes the formation of mva from acetyl-coa and is referred to as the ‘upper’ pathway. the other operon is composed of erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  and idi <dig>  this operon converts mva to dmapp and is called the ‘lower’ pathway. dmapp is further converted to isoprene by isoprene synthase from populus alba . although much success has been achieved regarding isoprene biosynthesis, many problems remain to be solved, such as the intermediate imbalance resulting from heterologous over-expression of so many non-native genes in the host  <cit> . to overcome these hurdles, one approach is to employ a chromosome integration method to reduce the burden of cell growth resulting from the over-expression of heterologous genes  <cit> .

recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have made it possible to construct a new pathway to replace the native pathway by optimizing and assembling different sources of the enzymes. for example, liao used an evolving citramalate synthase  from methanococcus jannaschii to devise an innovative pathway that directly converted pyruvate to 2-ketobutyrate and avoided threonine biosynthesis. this constructed pathway is the simplest keto acid-mediated pathway for the biosynthesis of 1-propanol and 1-butanol generated from glucose  <cit> . atsumi employed a strategy using the host’s highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway to synhthesize 2-keto acid intermediates which were further transformed into higher alcohols by 2-keto-acid decarboxylases  and alcohol dehydrogenases   <cit> . in this strategy, by adjusting the intermediates from amino acid biosynthesis pathways to alcohol production, biofuels were produced through two final unnatural steps.

in this paper, we designed an innovative biosynthetic route for isoprene production by assembling the mva upper pathway from enterococcus faecalis, the fatty acid decarboxylase  from jeotgalicoccus sp. atcc  <dig> and the oleate hydratase  from elizabethkingia meningoseptica into a new pathway in e. coli . this new pathway is of great importance for several reasons. first, fatty acid decarboxylase  was shown for the first time to catalyze the transition of mva to 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol. furthermore, compared with the traditional mva pathway, this novel pathway has been shortened by  <dig> steps. it represents the shortest mva-mediated pathway for the production of isoprene from glucose. in summary, this paper develops a distinctive synthetic route to isoprene production that differs from the well-developed mep pathway and mva pathway by a large degree.fig.  <dig> production of isoprene via the novel mva-mediated pathway used in this study. the dashed box shows the traditional pathway for mva conversion to isoprene  <cit> , while the new pathway constructed in this study is within the solid-lined box. enzyme symbols: mvae  and mvas  from enterococcus faecalis; erg <dig> , erg <dig> , erg <dig>  and idi <dig>  from saccharomyces cerevisiae; isps  from populus alba. oletje from jeotgalicoccus species; ohyaem from elizabethkingia meningoseptica. pathway intermediates: a-coa, acetyl-coa; aa-coa, acetoacetyl-coa; hmg-coa, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa; mev-p, mevalonate 5-phosphate; mev-pp, mevalonate pyrophosphate. ipp, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; dmapp, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate



RESULTS
overexpression and functional analysis of oletje
the function of the fatty acid decarboxylase  from jeotgalicoccus sp. atcc  <dig> to decarboxylate long-chain fatty acids into their corresponding terminal olefins has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . in this study, we determined whether oletje could directly catalyze the mva decarboxylation reaction. the nucleotide sequence of the fatty acid decarboxylase  generated from jeotgalicoccus sp. atcc  <dig> was introduced into the plasmid pcoladuet- <dig>  the recombinant oletje protein carrying a n-terminal six-histidine tag was purified from e. coli, and identified by sds-page . the enzyme activity was measured in a gas chromatography vial and a 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol specific peak was detected by gc-ms . no detectable 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol was formed when the purified enzyme or mva was omitted from the assay. these results indicated that the isolated recombinant protein possessed mva decarboxylase activity and was able to convert mva to 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol. to our knowledge, this reaction has not been previously documented.fig.  <dig> enzymatic assay for 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol production by oletje using gc-ms and sds-page analysis. a gc-ms analysis of a 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol sample produced by the oletje assay mixtures. b sds-page analysis of oletje. ck: cell lysate from bl <dig> containing pcoladuet- <dig>  1: crude cell extracts from yjm <dig>  2: purified oletje




in the native mva pathway, mva is phosphorylated twice and decarboxylated to form ipp. this process requires three enzymes, including mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase  <cit> . then, using the enzyme pyrophosphatase or phosphatase, ipp can be converted into 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol by removing the pyrophosphates  <cit> . to shorten the reaction steps of this pathway, we selected the enzyme fatty acid decarboxylase  from jeotgalicoccus species, which has the ability to directly decarboxylate mva into 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol using only one step. the experimental results showed that the reaction catalyzed by the oletje enzyme shortened the pathway and was able to convert mva to 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol in only one step without phosphorylation. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the above-mentioned reaction.

overexpression and functional analysis of ohyaem
the capacity for cells containing oleate hydratase to transform oleic acid  into 10-hydroxystearic acid  was first characterized by wallen et al. in pseudomonas sp. strain  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> . niehaus then showed that the reaction was reversible  <cit> . however, only in recent years was the gene encoding oleate hydratase in elizabethkingia meningoseptica  cloned and expressed in e. coli  <cit> . marliere demonstrated that oleate hydratase has the ability to catalyze the dehydration of isobutanol to form isobutene  <cit> .

according to the above-referenced studies, the enzyme oleate hydratase can dehydrate 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol into isoprene. in our study, the nucleotide sequence of the ohyaem gene from elizabethkingia meningoseptica was altered based on the preferred codon usage of e. coli and subsequently cloned into the vector pcoladuet- <dig>  the protein was expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  and purified using a nickel-affinity chromatography column. the band of the recombinant protein was observable on coomassie-stained sds-page gel of the crude cell extracts . the enzyme assay was conducted in a gas chromatography vial with gc-ms being used to verify an isoprene-specific peak . no detectable isoprene was produced when the purified enzyme or 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol was omitted from the assay. the results suggested that the enzyme ohyaem from elizabethkingia meningoseptica is capable of catalyzing the dehydroxylation of 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol into isoprene.fig.  <dig> enzymatic assay for isoprene production by ohyaem using gc-ms and sds-page analysis. a gc-ms analysis of a isoprene sample produced by the ohyaem assay mixtures. b sds-page analysis of ohyaem. ck: cell lysate from bl <dig> containing pcoladuet- <dig>  1: crude cell extracts from yjm <dig>  2: purified ohyaem




establishing a novel biosynthetic pathway for isoprene in engineered e. coli
in previous experiments, the engineered strain yjm <dig> containing the efficient mva upper pathway from enterococcus faecalis was constructed, resulting in the accumulation of up to  <dig>  g/l of mva under flask culture conditions  <cit> . to subsequently obtain isoprene from glucose, we transformed the plasmid pyjm <dig> carrying the oletje gene from jeotgalicoccus species and ohyaem gene from elizabethkingia meningoseptica into strain yjm <dig> harboring the mva upper pathway. the resulting engineered strain yjm <dig> was inoculated in 50 ml fermentation medium and cultured at 37 °c which was further cultivated at 30 °c for 36 h with  <dig>  mm iptg addition into the broth when the od <dig> attained about  <dig> . the isoprene production by the strain yjm <dig> reached  <dig>  μg/l. while the control engineered strain yjm <dig> only harboring upper mva pathway and the fatty acid decarboxylase  cannot generate the isoprene. the results proved that a novel biosynthetic pathway for isoprene production containing the mva upper pathway from enterococcus faecalis, the oletje gene from jeotgalicoccus species and ohyaem gene from elizabethkingia meningoseptica had been successfully constructed in e. coli.

in the previous studies, several research groups, including ours, established pathways for the conversion of mva to isoprene. this process typically requires five reactions, including a two-step phosphorylation catalyzed by mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase, a one-step decarboxylation catalyzed by mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase, a one-step isomerization catalyzed by ipp isomerase and a one-step dephosphorylation catalyzed by isoprene synthase  <cit> . this study is the first to use only two-step reactions to construct a new pathway for the conversion of mva to isoprene by combining the oletje gene from jeotgalicoccus species and ohyaem gene from elizabethkingia meningoseptica. accordingly, from the starting acetyl-coa to the final product isoprene, the entire pathway containing eight reactions was shortened to five reactions. the result is a promising step in the novel mva-mediated biosynthetic pathway for isoprene production.

optimization of a biosynthetic pathway for isoprene production
to further enhance isoprene production, the expression levels of the oletje gene from jeotgalicoccus species and the ohyaem gene from elizabethkingia meningoseptica were optimized by using different plasmid vectors containing different copy numbers and promoters. as is shown in fig.  <dig>  there achieved more isoprene production of the oletje gene and ohyaem gene when under the control of the t <dig> promoter  than that of the arabad promoter . the highest isoprene production  was found in the strain yjm <dig> harboring a high copy number plasmid, which was three-fold greater than the production of isoprene by yjm <dig> using lower copy number plasmids.fig.  <dig> optimization of the expression levels of olet

enhance isoprene production through optimizing the culture conditions
in our work, the “one-factor at-a-time” optimization strategy  was applied to augment isoprene productivity by optimizing the organic nitrogen source, induction temperature and iptg concentration respectively. the results showed that the highest isoprene yield  was obtained when the yjm <dig> strain was cultured in fermentation medium containing 20 g/l glucose as a carbon source, 9 g/l beef powder as an organic nitrogen source and induced with  <dig>  mm iptg at 31 °c whose combined optimization effect could contribute to an approximately 42-fold increase in isoprene production.

microbial isoprene production using the novel biosynthetic pathway
to assess the isoprene biosynthesis in a scalable process using the engineered strain yjm <dig> with the novel biosynthetic pathway encoded on the plasmids pyjm <dig>  and pyjm <dig> , the fermentation of yjm <dig> under fed-batch condition was conducted on a 5-l scale. at an od <dig> of ~ <dig>   <dig>  mm iptg was put into the broth to induce the heterologous genes of the pathway for expression. after depleting the glucose initially present in the media, glucose solution  was added to the cultures, and the residual glucose was restrained below  <dig>  g/l to reduce acetate production. the od <dig> at the end of the fermentation was ~ <dig>  as is shown in fig.  <dig>  isoprene gradually accumulated over the course of the fermentation and amounted to 620 mg/l with a productivity of  <dig>  mg/l/h within 32 h . in addition, isoprene production rose dramatically from 4 h to 16 h after being induced, and the productivity of isoprene attained  <dig>  mg/l/h.fig.  <dig> the time course of isoprene production by yjm <dig>  cell growth  and isoprene accumulation  in yjm <dig>  cells were induced when the od <dig> reached approximately  <dig> at 31 °c. other experimental conditions are described in the section entitled “fed-batch fermentation”



although much progress has been made regarding the novel biosynthetic pathway of isoprene in e. coli, the present productivity remains too low and it is economically unfeasible for large scale production. the reason for the low yield could be the low catalytic activity of the enzymes oletje and ohyaem. future studies should focus on enhancing the efficiency of the novel pathway using the following approaches:  the structures of both enzymes should be elucidated. based on the structural data, it may be possible to enhance the catalytic efficiency by mutating key amino acids in the binding sites and catalytic active sites  <cit>  or to increase enzyme expression level by optimizing the shine-dalgarno sequence of enzyme  <cit> .  the pathway might be dynamically regulated using the dynamic sensor-regulator system  developed by keasling to bio-synthesize fatty acid-based products in e. coli  <cit> . the dsrs utilizes a transcription factor which can sense a crucial intermediate and dynamically regulate the expression level of genes related to target product synthesis. consequently, if the natural sensor for crucial intermediate of mva can be found, we can develop a dsrs for isoprene production to equilibrate metabolic pathway, thus enhancing product concentration, conversion efficiency and host’s genetic stability.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, isoprene was synthesized through a distinctive biosynthetic pathway harboring the mva upper pathway from enterococcus faecalis, the oletje gene from jeotgalicoccus species and the ohyaem gene from elizabethkingia meningoseptica in an engineered e. coli strain. the most optimized strain, yjm <dig>  bearing the novel mva-mediated biosynthetic pathway of isoprene, accumulated isoprene up to  <dig>  mg/l and 620 mg/l under conditions of flask fermentation and fed-batch fermentation, respectively. despite the relatively low level of isoprene production by this novel pathway, we have reduced the complexity of the native isoprene pathway by introducing two novel enzymes to catalyze the formation of isoprene from mevalonate in only  <dig> steps instead of  <dig> 

to our knowledge, this is the first report of the conversion of mva into 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol by fatty acid decarboxylase  from jeotgalicoccus species, and it is also the first to describe the catalysis of mva to isoprene with simultaneous heterologous expression of the oletje gene from jeotgalicoccus species and the ohyaem gene from elizabethkingia meningoseptica. therefore, this study supplies an unusual synthetic route for bio-isoprene production that is very different from the well-characterized mep pathway or mva pathway.
