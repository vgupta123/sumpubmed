BACKGROUND
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is the most common inherited renal cystic disease, with a prevalence of approximately  <dig> in  <dig>  individuals  <cit> . adpkd is characterized by the progressive formation of fluid-filled cysts within the kidney which ultimately disrupt renal function, as well as various extrarenal manifestations  <cit> . mutations in two genes, pkd <dig>  and pkd <dig>  account for approximately 85% and 15% of disease cases, respectively  <cit> . the occurrence of disease in patients lacking mutations in either of these genes suggests the involvement of other genetic loci, but this is still uncertain  <cit> . pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> encode the proteins polycystin- <dig>  and polycystin- <dig> , respectively. pc <dig> is a multidomain membrane receptor capable of binding and interacting with proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates and stimulating intracellular signaling pathways. pc <dig> is a membrane protein which acts as a ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel. pc <dig> and pc <dig> can interact, and in the process, modulate each other’s activity  <cit> .

among the animal models of polycystic kidney disease, the pkd/mhm rat recapitulates many of the hallmarks of human adpkd  <cit> . the cy mutation was found to be a missense mutation in the anks <dig> gene, encoding ankyrin repeat and sam-domain containing protein  <dig>   <cit> . human anks <dig> is an  <dig> amino acid protein containing  <dig> ankyrin repeats at its n-terminus and a sam domain near its c-terminus . the cy mutation occurs in the sam domain and generates an arginine to tryptophan mutation at amino acid  <dig>  <cit> . the r823w point mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion, as evidenced by the pkd phenotype of transgenic rats over-expressing mutated anks <dig> <cit> .

recently anks <dig> has also been implicated in human renal disease. in particular, the work hoff and halbritter et al.  <cit>  has placed anks <dig> as a central node in a network of nephronophthisis -associated proteins, including direct binding between the ankyrin-repeat domain of anks <dig> and nek <dig>  a nima -related serine-threonine kinase which is mutated in nephronophthisis. moreover,  <dig> individuals from  <dig> different families bearing homozygous mutations in anks <dig> all presented with nephronophthisis, which is essentially an infantile or juvenile onset of pkd  <cit> . while several of the detected mutations localize to the ankyrin repeats, one generates a truncation within the sam domain at tyr <dig>  thus, the sam domain has been shown in both rats and humans to be essential for normal anks <dig> function.

sam domains consist of approximately  <dig> amino acids and adopt a globular structure generally containing a core of five α-helices  <cit> . most sam domains that have been characterized are protein-protein interaction modules that either self-associate  <cit> , bind to other sam-domain containing proteins  <cit> , or bind other proteins altogether  <cit> . some sam domains have been found to bind rna and lipids, however  <cit> . the protein-protein interactions of sam domains are typically mediated by two distinct surfaces on the domain, termed the mid-loop  and end-helix  surfaces. sams can bind each other via their ml and eh surfaces, to generate open-ended polymers  <cit> , closed oligomers  <cit> , and heterodimers  <cit> . through polymer formation and heterotypic interactions, sam domains confer a diverse array of biological functions including gene regulation  <cit> , enzyme localization  <cit> , and scaffolding  <cit> .

in spite of the important role of the anks6-sam domain in cystic kidney disease, the function of anks <dig> remains unknown. prior work using a proteomics screen of tandem affinity purified -tagged nphp-associated proteins found that anks <dig> and ankyrin repeat and sam-domain containing protein  <dig>  are potential binding partners  <cit> . anks <dig> has a similar domain structure to anks <dig> including a c-terminal sam domain . here we define the anks6/anks <dig> interaction by discovering that the anks <dig> sam domain binds to the sam domain of anks <dig>  we show that anks3-sam forms polymers and that anks <dig> binds to one end of these polymers. the r823w mutation was found to disrupt the structure of the anks <dig> sam domain and negatively affects binding to anks3-sam. our results provide a structural explanation for the defect in pkd/mhm rats and a potential new pathway to cystic disease via the sam domain of anks <dig> 

RESULTS
neggfp native gel screen identifies anks3-sam + anks6-sam interaction
to identify new human sam domain hetero-interactions involving anks <dig>  we employed a rapid screen for binding activity, outlined in figure 2a. sam domains were fused to an engineered green fluorescent protein modified to have a net charge of − <dig>   <cit> . the high charge on the neggfp effectively solubilizes even insoluble proteins, and leads to consistent migration of the fusion proteins towards the cathode on a native gel  <cit> . binding between two neggfp fusion proteins is detected as the appearance of a new band with retarded migration on native gels. because the fusions are fluorescent, assays can be performed using crude extracts. thus, many different combinations of proteins can be rapidly screened using this technique.

extract containing neggfp-anks3-sam fusion protein was mixed with extracts containing neggfp-sam fusions from  <dig> different human sam domain-containing proteins  and binding was tested by native gel electrophoresis. among the human sams assayed, we detected a novel interaction between anks3-sam and anks6-sam . consistent with prior results, neggfp-anks6-sam appears monomeric as it runs as a discrete band with migration similar to other monomeric sam domains  <cit> . in contrast, the neggfp-anks3-sam fusion runs as a more diffuse band with slightly slower migration, behavior that was observed previously and is typical of weakly polymeric sam domains  <cit> . when neggfp-anks3-sam and neggfp-anks6-sam were mixed in a 1: <dig> ratio, the appearance of a new slower migrating species indicates that anks3-sam and anks6-sam bind to each other. we therefore decided to investigate the polymeric character of anks3-sam and the novel anks3-sam + anks6-sam hetero-interaction further.

anks3-sam is polymeric
we first chose to characterize the anks3-sam domain and investigate whether anks3-sam forms a polymer. in a prior screen for sam polymers, neggfp-anks3-sam was observed by negative stain transmission electron microscopy  to form short polymeric structures  <cit> . we re-examined the neggfp-anks3-sam fusion and obtained results consistent with earlier work, showing short polymers  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm wide on average and varying in length from 20–90 nm, with an average length of approximately 36 nm .

since the addition of neggfp in the sam fusion proteins introduces charge repulsion that weakens sam domain interaction and polymerization, we next examined the anks3-sam domain by itself. without the neggfp fusion, anks3-sam was much less soluble and precipitated after purification. we examined the precipitate by tem and saw enormous sheets of polymers, some extending more than 1 μm long and  <dig>  μm wide . individual polymers within the fiber-like sheets were approximately 4–6 nm wide. the ability of sam domains to organize as sheets of polymers has been seen previously with the sam domains of dgkδ and shank <dig>  <cit> , however it is unclear whether sheet formation is physiologically relevant for anks3-sam.

mapping the anks3-sam polymer
to determine the interfaces of anks3-sam responsible for polymer formation, we employed our neggfp binding assay to rapidly screen for point mutants that blocked polymerization. a similar approach was used in our previous study of the caskin <dig> tandem sam domains  <cit> . we targeted putative ml and eh surface residues to find those that yielded faster migration on a native gel. as shown in figure 4a, the mutations d31k, i36e and e47k on the ml-surface and l52e, f53e and k58e on the eh-surface inhibited polymerization. thus, anks3-sam appears to form a polymer using an interface common to other sam polymers  <cit> .

the identification of monomeric anks3-sam mutants allowed us to measure binding affinity between subunits using surface plasmon resonance . to measure affinity of the native interface, we immobilized an anks3-sam eh-surface mutant, f53e, on an spr chip and detected equilibrium binding to an ml-surface mutant, i36e. at  <dig>  m nacl, we observe hyperbolic binding with a kd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . as many of the mutations that reduce polymerization involve charged residues, we also examined the salt dependence of binding. as shown in figure 4f, where the salt sensitivity of a protein-protein interaction is indicated by the slope of a log kd versus log  plot  <cit> , the binding affinity is indeed strongly dependent on salt concentration.

structure of the anks3-sam polymer
to better understand how the anks3-sam domain forms polymers we sought a crystal structure of the polymer. because the wild-type sam domain is relatively insoluble, forming heterogeneous polymers, it cannot be crystallized directly. we therefore used a strategy that has proven successful for a number of other sam domain polymers, where we attempt to crystallize sam domains with mutations in the polymer interface  <cit> . the mutations weaken subunit association so that the protein remains soluble during purification but under the high concentrations required for crystallization, the polymer interface remains a favorable site for crystal contacts, thereby generating the polymer in the crystal.

we were able to obtain a crystal structure of the l52a mutant . anks3-sam l52a crystallized in space group p <dig> with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and the structure was solved to  <dig>  Å resolution. each sam domain has the characteristic five α-helical fold and chains in the asymmetric unit are nearly identical . examination of the crystal packing reveals a triple helix of intertwined sam polymers . individual sam polymers contain  <dig> sams per helical repeat, with each helical repeat measuring 72 Å in diameter and 100 Å in length. as expected from the mutational studies described above, the anks <dig> sam domains associate via sequential interactions of ml and eh surfaces . the ml-surface, formed by residues spanning loop  <dig> through helix  <dig>  is composed of a shallow hydrophobic patch  flanked by negatively charged residues . the eh-surface encompasses the n-terminal portion of helix  <dig> and contains a critical phe  which packs against the hydrophobic patch of a neighboring ml-surface. several positively charged residues  surround f <dig>  creating a ring of positive charge which binds the ring of negative charge on a neighboring ml-surface through the formation of salt bridges . the striking asymmetric charge distribution is consistent with the strong salt dependence of subunit association .

the crystal structure is consistent with the identified polymer-blocking mutants . f53e removes a key hydrophobic contact of the eh-surface and i36e introduces steric overlap and disruption of the ml-surface. the l52a mutation used in the crystal structure is found at the end of helix  <dig> and appears to remove van der waals packing and complementary hydrophobic surface at the interface. the mutations d31k and e47k remove ionic interactions. finally, k <dig> was also found crucial for polymerization and although it does not form a direct salt bridge in the crystal structure, this residue is near the interface and helps to maintain charge complementarity. it is also possible that the interface is altered somewhat in the mutant structure, weakening and/or breaking some salt bridges. the width of the single polymer  is thicker than the polymers seen by tem  but sam domain polymers are known to stretch and compact readily in different crystal forms  <cit> .

individual anks3-sam polymers pack in the crystal structure as a striking triple helix, but we do not know if this is a biologically relevant structure. caskin <dig>  which also contained  <dig> sams per helical polymer repeat, adopted a triple helix in the crystal, but it was shown to likely be an artifact of crystallization  <cit> . the n- and c-termini do splay out from the triple helix, so the remaining domains of the full-length protein could be accommodated. moreover, there is charge complementarity between polymer surfaces. in particular, the polymer surface viewed from the free ml-surface end  has negative patches which complement the positive patches seen from the free eh-surface end . unlike the inter-polymer association seen in the caskin <dig> structure which was largely mediated by an added his6-tag, the triple helix of anks3-sam is held together by residues ala3-gly <dig> of chain a  intercalating between sam polymers of an adjacent triple helix . nevertheless, the polymers are not packed tightly, as there are ample gaps between individual polymers.

the phenomenon of anks3-sam polymer sheet formation observed by tem also remains to be tested in the context of the full-length protein. sheets of triple helices can be constructed from the crystal structure, but the sheets formed in the crystal packing  would be incompatible with triple helix formation. although the n- and c- termini extend away from the triple helix polymer axis, additional domains of the full-length protein cannot be obviously accommodated in the sheets. if sheets do form as seen in the em images, it would require different packing than we see in the crystal structure.

the eh-surface of anks3-sam binds the ml-surface of anks6-sam
to map the binding interface between anks3-sam and anks6-sam, we employed the neggfp binding assay discussed above. as shown in figure 4b, mutations in residues l <dig>  f <dig>  and k <dig> on the eh-surface of anks3-sam and mutations in residues e <dig> and d <dig> on the ml-surface of anks6-sam abolish the anks3-sam + anks6-sam hetero-interaction in this assay.since the eh-surface of anks3-sam is required for both polymerization and binding to anks6-sam, these two events are mutually exclusive. therefore, anks6-sam binding to anks3-sam should block anks3-sam polymerization. to test this possibility, we mixed anks6-sam with the insoluble anks3-sam polymer described above. as shown in figure 4c, the addition of anks6-sam does indeed lead to solubilization of the anks3-sam precipitate.

the ability of anks6-sam to solubilize anks3-sam polymers and the slower migration of the hetero-interaction on the native gel compared to anks3-sam suggests that anks6-sam has a higher affinity for anks3-sam than anks3-sam does for itself. to determine the affinity of the anks3-sam/anks6-sam interface we again used spr by immobilizing anks6-sam and measuring equilibrium binding to an anks3-sam ml-surface mutant, i36e. at  <dig>  m nacl, we observed a high binding affinity  . this affinity is more than an order of magnitude tighter than the binding affinity we measured for the native eh-ml interface formed between anks3-sams , indicating that anks6-sam binding could effectively compete with polymerization. binding is also strongly salt dependent as shown in figure 4f, suggesting that ionic interactions are important features of the interface.

structure of the anks3-sam/anks6-sam complex
to learn how anks3-sam and anks6-sam bind each other, we determined a crystal structure of the complex . to prevent anks3-sam polymerization without destroying anks6-sam binding, we mixed an ml-surface mutant of anks3-sam, i36e, with wild-type anks6-sam. these proteins formed a heterodimer when analyzed by sec-mals  and yielded crystals suitable for structure determination.

the anks3-sam/anks6-sam heterodimer crystallized in space group c <dig> with four molecules  per asymmetric unit. both of the anks3-sam chains and both anks6-sam chains in the asymmetric unit had closely similar structures, with rmsds between backbone atoms of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively. additionally, the overall structure of anks3-sam i36e aligns well with anks6-sam  with the only obvious difference being a  <dig>  Å outward shift of anks6-sam’s helix  <dig> similar to the ml-surface of anks3-sam, the ml-surface of anks6-sam contains a shallow hydrophobic patch  flanked by negatively charged residues  . many of these charged residues form salt bridges with anks3-sam . other residues of anks6-sam  form hydrogen bonds with anks3-sam bridged by water. these results are consistent with our native gel analysis of critical interface residues . similar to the anks3-sam/anks3-sam interface, the f53e mutation in anks3-sam removes a phe required for packing against the hydrophobic patch of the anks6-sam ml-surface and the l52e mutation removes van der waals interactions and hydrophobic contacts that otherwise stabilize the interaction interface. removal of salt bridges by the mutations k58e in anks3-sam, e29k in anks6-sam, and d42k in anks6-sam also break the interface. the anks6-sam mutation r54w  breaks the interaction with anks3-sam as well and will be discussed below.

comparing an anks3-sam/anks6-sam heterodimer with an anks3-sam homodimer by aligning the anks3-sams, we see that anks6-sam is tilted closer towards anks3-sam . this anks3-sam/anks6-sam interface buries on average 454 Å <dig> of surface area, which is approximately 100 Å <dig> more than was buried at the same interface in the anks3-sam polymer. an isoleucine  in anks3-sam is switched for an alanine  in anks6-sam at the ml-surface. the decreased steric bulk of ala compared to ile allows helix  <dig> of anks6-sam’s ml-surface to approach the eh-surface of anks3-sam more closely, resulting in the burial of additional surface area and the formation of more salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which may explain the higher affinity of the anks3-sam/anks6-sam interface. the anks6-sam structure also shows that the eh-surface is lacking a large hydrophobic residue flanked by positively charged residues, thereby showing that anks6-sam cannot polymerize because its eh-surface is incompatible with binding its ml-surface.

the r823w mutation of pkd/mhm rats perturbs the structure of anks6-sam
using our native gel binding assay, we discovered that the cy mutation  in anks6-sam destroys the interaction with anks3-sam . this interaction could not be restored by titrating increasing amounts of anks6-sam r823w with anks3-sam . to understand how the cy mutation might be responsible for disease in pkd/mhm rats, we examined its position in our structure of anks6-sam. r <dig>  forms salt bridges with d <dig> of helix  <dig> and d <dig> of helix  <dig>  and forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of i <dig> and k <dig> which both lie on a loop between helices  <dig> and  <dig> . through these interactions, r <dig> is involved in stapling helices  <dig> and  <dig> and in maintaining the overall fold in this segment of the domain.

since the r823w mutation does not lie on either the ml- or eh-surface of anks6-sam, we reasoned that its ability to abolish binding to anks3-sam must be due to a long range structural alteration. indeed the far-uv cd spectrum of anks6-sam r823w shows an approximately 10% loss of helical structure with a parallel increase in random coil compared to the wild-type protein . moreover, the stability of the protein is dramatically reduced. as shown in figure 7d, wild-type anks6-sam displayed a broad, reversible unfolding curve with a tm of approximately 48°c. in contrast, the anks6-sam r823w mutant strikingly exhibited a complete loss of cooperative unfolding. therefore, the r823w mutation appears to dramatically destabilize the structure. the mutant protein also migrates slightly faster and with a higher molecular weight as assessed by sec-mals , consistent with generalized unfolding. indeed, modeling a tryptophan at position r <dig> in our structure is impossible as this would introduce severe steric clashes. thus, coupling the removal of arg with the insertion of a trp disturbs the overall tertiary structure of the protein and prevents the ml-surface of the anks6-sam domain from adopting a fold complementary to binding the anks3-sam domain.

discussion
the pkd/mhm rat, in which an r823w mutation in the sam domain of anks <dig> is causal of disease, has been used extensively as an animal model for the study of human adpkd. however, the underlying mechanism whereby this single mutation leads to improper kidney development and loss of renal function has been unclear. for the first time, we have identified the sam domain of anks <dig> as a direct binding partner of the anks6-sam domain and shown that this interaction is lost in the anks6-sam r823w mutant. the physiological relevance of this interaction is supported by the independent identification of the potential anks3/anks <dig> interaction in a proteomics screen  <cit> .

by solving the crystal structure of anks3-sam, we have observed that anks3-sam forms polymers via sequential interactions of ml- and eh-surfaces, much like other sam domains. the polymer formation by anks3-sam suggests that anks <dig> may be capable of scaffolding a larger protein complex. we also observed higher order structure of the polymer, including a triple helix in the crystal and sheet structures in tem images, but the biological relevance of these polymer associations is unclear. sam domains have been previously found to organize as sheets of polymers that require divalent metal cation binding to form  <cit> , but we did not observe any obvious metal binding sites in the anks3-sam crystal structure.

by solving a crystal structure of the anks3-sam/anks6-sam heterodimer, we observed that the eh-surface of anks3-sam binds the ml-surface of anks6-sam. we have also provided a molecular explanation for the defect in the r823w mutation: it disrupts the tertiary structure of the anks6-sam domain and prevents the ml-surface of anks6-sam from adopting a conformation capable of binding anks3-sam. because the eh-surface of anks3-sam is mutually exclusive for binding either the ml-surface of anks3-sam or the ml-surface of anks6-sam, we expect that anks <dig> may act as a polymer capper  <cit> . it may shorten the anks3-sam polymers or it may simply recruit anks <dig> polymers to a larger complex of proteins.

anks <dig> has been linked to bicaudal-c <dig> , a protein that when mutated is responsible for disease in the jcpk mouse model of adpkd and the bpk mouse model of arpkd   <cit> . anks <dig> and bicc <dig> have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in inner medullary collecting duct  cells. an unidentified protein complex has been suggested to link anks <dig> to bicc <dig>  by binding both the anks6-sam domain and a strand of rna to which the kh domains of bicc <dig> are bound  <cit> . it is reasonable to suspect that anks <dig> may also be part of a complex with anks <dig> and bicc <dig> 

transgenic overexpression of anks <dig> can generate a disease phenotype, indicating that anks6-sam r823w acts as a dominant negative  <cit> . a dominant negative effect would be expected to arise from a gain of function, yet the mutation clearly destabilizes the structure of the sam domain. a reasonable possibility is that other domains on anks <dig> recruit it to a complex  <cit> , but the defective sam domain fails to appropriately recruit other proteins, such as anks <dig>  leading to defective function. altered rxr-mediated signaling pathways are observed in pkd/mhm rats  <cit>  and anks <dig> has recently been placed as a central node in a distinct nphp-associated signaling network  <cit> .

the recent finding of mutations in anks <dig> in individuals presenting with polycystic kidney disease  <cit>  has catapulted this protein from relevance in an animal model to having direct implications for human renal development and function. furthermore, the fact that one patient with a truncation in anks <dig> at the n-terminal end of the sam domain also presented with aortic stenosis, causing obstructive cardiomyopathy, implicates anks <dig> in cardiac development and function  <cit> . whether anks <dig> may also have a role in cardiac development, via its link with anks <dig>  remains to be investigated. so far, anks <dig> is the only direct binding partner of anks <dig> identified that is affected by the r823w mutation. our work provides a structural and biochemical basis for future work on anks <dig> and its interaction with anks <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and characterized the novel interaction between the sam domain of anks <dig> and the sam domain of anks <dig>  anks3-sam was found to be capable of polymerization, although polymer formation and binding to anks <dig> appear mutually exclusive, suggesting anks <dig> may act as a polymer capper. the r823w mutation associated with cystic kidney disease causes a destabilization of the anks <dig> sam domain which disrupts binding to anks <dig>  by structurally and biochemically characterizing this new interaction we provide a foundation to support continued research into how the anks3/anks <dig> interaction affects kidney function.
