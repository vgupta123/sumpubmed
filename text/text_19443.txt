BACKGROUND
choosing suitable oviposition sites is a fundamental strategy and for most species the only care provided for their offspring  <cit> . therefore, animals should carefully assess cues that signify the quality of the site, the risk of predation, and the likelihood of competition. although experience may refine an animal’s responses  <cit> , these signals often trigger innate responses through hard-wired neural circuitries  <cit> .

plants emit a plethora of volatile organic compounds  that herbivorous insects use as orientation cues  <cit> . herbivore damage induces plants to activate specific biochemical pathways that heighten their defence against herbivores. in addition to toxins and antifeedants, induced defences can also be indirect by recruiting natural enemies of herbivores using herbivore-induced plant volatiles . these are generally composed of green leaf volatiles  and a set of terpenoids . parasitoids and predators cue in to several of these compounds  <cit> , of which the most well studied is the de novo synthesized homoterpene, - <dig> -dimethyl- <dig> ,7-nonatriene   <cit> .

herbivores themselves are also sensitive to hipvs, and prefer plants that do not emit these odours  <cit> . detection and avoidance of induced plants has benefits for ovipositing herbivores.  hipvs indicate intra- or interspecific competitors in the host plant site  <cit> .  they indicate a heightened defence response in attacked plants  <cit>  and frequently in its downwind neighbours  <cit> , which generally affects survival, particularly of early larval instars  <cit> .  finally, offspring in sites containing induced plants will likely suffer a higher level of parasitization and predation  <cit> .

several studies have demonstrated the significance of odours in aversion of induced plants  <cit> . yet, herbivore detection of hipvs has not been dissected out either behaviourally or physiologically, in spite of their fundamental role in push-pull systems and their potential for novel chemical ecology-based methods of insect control  <cit> .

in this study we show that dmnt, a key plant compound used by natural enemies in finding prey, is used by females and males of the egyptian cotton leaf worm , to avoid induced plant sites and calling females, respectively. finally, we found that behavioural disruption is paralleled by suppression of pheromone and plant odour induced-activity in the antennal lobes  and antennae without any dmnt-specific neural channel. olfactory sensory inhibition appears of behavioural and evolutionary ecological significance, and might benefit fitness of herbivores by assessing risks of predation and competition. the importance of the findings is also discussed in the light of sustainable agriculture.

RESULTS
herbivore-damaged plants affect behaviour
according to previous studies, damaged and undamaged cotton plants emit different patterns of volatiles. a series of tests was performed to confirm that these patterns differentially affect the behavioural response of moths . in wind tunnel dual-choice assays, a higher percentage of virgin males was attracted to the sex pheromone extract with odorant background from undamaged than from damaged plants . when virgin females had access to either damaged or undamaged plants in cage assays, calling behaviour was suppressed when females perched on herbivore-induced plants compared to females on undamaged plants . this effect was independent of female age . these results confirmed that herbivore-induced cotton plants suppressed sexual behaviours in both males and females compared to undamaged plants. however, it remained to be tested which volatile compound suppressed these behavioural responses.fig.  <dig> behavioural responses of male and female s. littoralis to odours from plants or synthetic blends. bars represent proportions of attracted moths . a attraction of virgin male moths towards pheromone gland extracts in a wind tunnel assay with herbivore-damaged or undamaged cotton plants as odour background . b proportion of virgin female moths that exhibited calling behaviour in the presence of either damaged or undamaged cotton plants . c attraction of mated females to cotton headspace collection , mix- <dig> and mix-5:dmnt . d attraction of virgin males to cotton headspace , mix- <dig> and mix-5:dmnt were not significantly different . e pheromone-triggered response of males was suppressed by dmnt at different ratios . different letters indicate statistical differences between the odours 



dmnt effects on flight behaviour
we investigated the effect of the hipv dmnt on the behaviour of male and female moths due to its emission in high amounts by damaged cotton plants  and its ecological importance in attracting natural enemies. based on previous analyses of cotton vocs  <cit> , we designed a synthetic plant blend  that optimized attraction of s. littoralis  <cit>  and that could also be used in physiological assays. mix- <dig> contained five volatile compounds found in the cotton headspace: β-myrcene, ocimene, --limonene, -3-hexenyl acetate and nonanal.

in wind tunnel assays using a piezo-electric sprayer to disperse stimuli, cotton headspace collection  triggered weaker behavioural responses of mated female moths than mix- <dig> did . addition of dmnt to mix- <dig> strongly inhibited take-off and upwind flight steps .

attraction of males to cotton headspace collection  and mix- <dig> was relatively weak compared to females, and it was not significantly affected by the addition of dmnt . conversely, attraction to the main pheromone component, z <dig> e11-14:oac, was disrupted in the presence of dmnt at several concentrations .

these findings demonstrate that dmnt is an active compound in the cotton volatile blend that significantly interferes in odorant perception in both sexes, affecting their mating and oviposition choices. next we investigated how dmnt affected odour coding in males and females.

dmnt suppressed odour-evoked ca2+ responses in males
the largest glomerulus of the macroglomerular complex  of s. littoralis, the cumulus, is dedicated to detecting the main pheromone component, z <dig> e11-14:oac  <cit> . as the major pheromone alone induces robust upwind flight in males, we focussed on the responses of the cumulus to z <dig> e11-14:oac alone and in combination with dmnt using ca2+ imaging. z <dig> e11-14:oac  elicited calcium responses in the cumulus, but addition of dmnt suppressed them . suppression was particularly strong at 10 μg of z <dig> e11-14:oac  and more gradual at 1 μg with increasing doses of dmnt . response to dmnt alone was found only in ordinary glomeruli , but not in the cumulus . these results corroborate the inhibition of the olfactory-evoked behaviour of male moths when flying towards a pheromone source, and suggest that the pheromone and dmnt signals interact at the peripheral level, possibly either via competitive antagonism or allosteric inhibition, as was proposed for helitothis virescens  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of dmnt on ca2+ responses in male al to z <dig> e11-14:oac and mix- <dig>  images were collectively scaled to strongest activation, and symbols represent mean values of maximum odour responses of identified glomeruli . a computed map of glomeruli highlighting the area of the cumulus  and representative false colour-coded images of maximum ca2+ responses to pheromone  and dmnt  . b computed map showing the areas of ordinary glomeruli from which responses were calculated  and representative false colour-coded images of maximum ca2+ responses to mix- <dig>  mixed with dmnt  . c ca2+ responses of the cumulus  to 1 μg , 10 μg pheromone  and dmnt alone . d ca2+ responses over all glomeruli  from  <dig> moths to mix- <dig> concentration  <dig> ,  <dig>  and dmnt alone . different letters denote significantly different responses  within treatments 



male ordinary glomeruli responded to mix- <dig> at both concentrations . however, addition of dmnt to mix- <dig> suppressed ca2+ responses at mix- <dig> only at concentration  <dig> but not at concentration  <dig> . because of the weak behavioural responses to mix- <dig> in males , we did not further investigate the activity of individual glomeruli.

suppression of pheromone perception occurs at the peripheral level
as responses from sensory neurons dominate ca2+ responses in the als, we verified if the inhibition of the response in combination with dmnt was due to presynaptic  inhibition, or whether the interaction occurred peripherally. recordings from male-specific long trichoid sensilla housing olfactory sensory neurons  that responded solely to pheromone demonstrated that addition of dmnt to the pheromone stimulus significantly reduced the response to the latter at different concentrations . this result suggests that attenuation of the pheromone osn firing response was independent of input from the dmnt osn.fig.  <dig> responses of osns to the main pheromone component, z <dig> e11-14:oac, and dmnt in male s. littoralis. response to control air was subtracted from stimulus responses. bars represent the mean values  of spike frequency during stimulation. different letters denote significantly different spike responses  within same treatments . n-values are indicated on bars



dmnt suppressed odour-evoked ca2+ responses in females
ca2+ responses to both concentrations of mix- <dig> in the als of females were suppressed by dmnt . dmnt triggered ca2+ responses only at 10 μg, the highest dose . it is likely that the expression of dmnt-responding ors in males and females is quantitatively similar, since the olfactory system of males seems to be as sensitive to dmnt as females are in dose-responses to dmnt. since attraction of s. littoralis females towards mix- <dig> was strongly disrupted by dmnt , we investigated whether the suppression was due to a particular single glomerulus or set of glomeruli, and whether dmnt disrupted the perception of any particular odour in the mixture. all test statistics of responses of individual glomeruli are presented in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> effect of dmnt on ca2+ responses in female als to the synthetic volatile mixtures. a computed map showing the areas of ordinary glomeruli from which responses were calculated  and representative false colour-coded images of ca2+ responses to mix- <dig>  and dmnt  . images were collectively scaled to strongest activation. b ca2+ responses over all glomeruli  from  <dig> moths to mix- <dig> concentration  <dig> ,  <dig> , mixed with dmnt , and dmnt alone . symbols represent the mean values of maximum ca2+ response . c ca2+ responses of individual ordinary glomeruli  to mix- <dig> concentration  <dig> ,  <dig>  mixed with dmnt, and dmnt alone . squares represent the mean values of maximum relative ca2+ response . different letters denote significantly different responses  within treatments 



using a set of reference compounds, we mapped on average  <dig> responding glomeruli per animal. based on activation patterns of reference compounds, eight glomeruli  were consistently identified. glomeruli differed substantially in their response to mix- <dig>  dmnt and their combinations. glomerulus  <dig> was not significantly suppressed by the addition of dmnt when responding to either concentration of mix- <dig>  unlike glomeruli  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . glomeruli  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were intermediate between these two, with dmnt-induced suppression only at the lower dose of mix- <dig> . suppression was not restricted to those glomeruli that responded to dmnt , indicating that besides competitive antagonism and allosteric interactions, other mechanisms may be involved in the suppressive activity of the dmnt-sensitive osn, such as presynaptic inhibition via local interneuron   <cit> .

next, we investigated ca2+ responses to single components in order to identify the response to which odorant of mix- <dig> was affected by dmnt. since significant suppression was already detected at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg dmnt, we focussed on these two doses. each compound from mix- <dig> was tested at 10 μg, which elicited significant calcium responses . ca2+ responses showed that only the response to -3-hexenyl acetate was significantly suppressed by addition of dmnt  compared to the other compounds . among six glomeruli activated by -3-hexenyl acetate, five were significantly suppressed by dmnt . again, this effect was not restricted to dmnt-activated glomeruli. some apparent mixture interactions were also observed. for instance, dmnt-induced suppression of glomerulus  <dig> was only observed when stimulating with -3-hexenyl acetate, but not with mix- <dig>  the opposite was observed for glomerulus  <dig>  it may thus be that the behavioural suppression by dmnt is not solely caused by suppression of responses in specific glomeruli, but is due to intricate ensemble effects.fig.  <dig> ca2+ responses of female ordinary glomeruli to each single plant odorant  mixed with dmnt . a. β-myrcene, b. --limonene, c. ocimene, d. --hexenyl acetate, e. nonanal. dmnt significantly suppressed the ca2+ response to -3-hexenyl acetate responding glomeruli except for glomerulus  <dig>  responses to other odorants were not suppressed by dmnt. bars represent the mean values of maximum relative ca2+ response  of each identified glomeruli. different letters denote significantly different calcium responses within odorants and glomeruli 



effect of --linalool and --linalool on pheromone responses
we compared the activity of dmnt to both linalool isomers, --linalool and --linalool, which were found to suppress pheromone-induced electrophysiological responses and oviposition  <cit> . to compare responses, we compensated for the emission from oil of both linalool enantiomers compared to dmnt by reducing their concentration in solution. --linalool and --linalool suppressed pheromone-induced ca2+ responses in male s. littoralis als. both enantiomers suppressed ca2+ responses from the cumulus to 10 μg pheromone --linalool: χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ; --linalool: χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ), in a similar way to dmnt . however, suppression at 1 μg pheromone was only observed with  <dig>  μg of --linalool  and not with --linalool . unlike dmnt, either isomer alone triggered a ca2+ response in the cumulus --linalool: χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ; --linalool: χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ). since pheromone-sensitive osns are finely tuned to pheromones only, it is possible that this phenomenon was caused by excessive stimulus fluxes.fig.  <dig> effect of --linalool and --linalool on ca2+ responses of male als to the pheromone component, . symbols represent the mean values of maximum relative ca2+ response of identified glomeruli . a maximum ca2+ responses of the cumulus  to pheromone  mixed with --linalool . response to increasing doses of --linalool alone is shown with open circles. b maximum ca2+ responses of the cumulus to pheromone  mixed with --linalool . response to increasing doses of --linalool alone is indicated by circles. c ca2+ responses over all glomeruli  from  <dig> moths to --linalool  and --linalool . different letters denote significantly different calcium responses  within the same treatments 



in ordinary glomeruli, both linalool isomers triggered strong ca2+ responses . significant responses were observed from the lowest concentration up --linalool: χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ; --linalool: χ2 =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ), whereas dmnt triggered a response only at the highest concentration . taken together, these results indicate that the olfactory system of s. littoralis is more sensitive to linalool than dmnt, whereas suppression by dmnt is stronger than by linalool. it is thus likely that dmnt is a more specific suppressive compound than both linalool isomers, and that the suppressive mechanism is highly sensitive to very low concentrations of dmnt.

discussion
olfactory sensory systems constitute the neural interface between organisms and their odour environment. they selectively gate relevant ecological information and accordingly modulate behavioural responses  <cit> . insects possess a multidimensional array of olfactory sensory neurons that registers fluxes and ratios of volatile compounds. the sensitivity of this array is thought to be finely tuned to the detection of ecologically relevant odours through a specific set of olfactory receptors they express  <cit> . this input is subsequently processed in the al, the primary olfactory centre in the insect brain  <cit> . als in male moths are equipped with enlarged glomeruli called the macroglomerular complex , which receives exclusive input from pheromone-specific osns  <cit> . the remaining isomorphic glomeruli  encode general odours such as plant vocs.

hipvs signal unfavourable environments and should, therefore, be detected and avoided. although herbivores indeed appear to avoid hipvs , the specific compounds within the complex hipv blend and the underlying neural mechanisms through which herbivore behaviour is suppressed were hitherto unknown. we demonstrate that dmnt is a key signal in the hipv blend that induced suppression of host and mate orientation in s. littoralis to cotton and that this is mediated through neuronal inhibition of olfactory responses. we are currently investigating whether other cotton hipvs, not included in the current study, may further augment behavioural inhibition towards induced cotton.

cotton hipvs redirect all basic odour-mediated behaviours in s. littoralis, that is, calling behaviour, oviposition, and orientation to cotton and partners  . using our cotton five-component mimic, we then demonstrated that dmnt, at ratios released by induced cotton, paralleled suppression of the above odour-mediated behaviours. cotton systemically releases relatively large amounts of dmnt upon herbivore attack  <cit> , as do other plants  . more interestingly, natural enemies use dmnt to find their hosts  <cit> . the evolutionary convergence of utilizing dmnt by both natural enemies and herbivores underlines its significance as a reliable signal in hipv blends. hipvs are diverse and consist of many compounds, some of which individually may not have a negative valence  <cit> . in contrast, dmnt appears highly characteristic for herbivore damage, released at the site of damage and systemically through induction of undamaged parts  <cit> , and even by neighbouring plants after volatile priming  <cit> .

we addressed how the moth encodes dmnt. the reigning paradigm is that ecologically relevant odours are either coded through an activation pattern across different sensory neuron types  or through narrowly tuned single-odour-single-neuron systems   <cit> . in drosophila, highly relevant negative stimuli are coded via activation of single receptor neuron types, and directly mediate repulsion  <cit> . however, dmnt detection in s. littoralis appears not to be coded via a dedicated repulsion-inducing sensory neuron type. instead, our recordings appear to support that dmnt acts through suppression of the activity of receptor neurons tuned to attractive compounds. this is to our knowledge the first demonstration that suppression of osn activity is of fundamental behavioural, ecological and evolutionary significance. furthermore, it places decades-old records of suppression of pheromone neuron activity by linalool and related compounds in an ecological framework, that is, tritrophic interactions. these earlier studies were conducted from a neurophysiological rather than an ecological perspective . the strong behavioural and ecological effects may in fact well be the evolutionary raison-d’-être of these interactions in the first place. although other insect species may have evolved sensory channels dedicated to dmnt detection, our results demonstrate that detection of ecologically highly relevant odours does not require these channels, but instead can be encoded via combinatorial suppression of odour-evoked responses. in an ecological context, attenuating odour-evoked responses and attraction may prevent full hipv-induced shutdown of host plant and mate orientation. this could be evolutionarily advantageous at high herbivore densities, and prevent herbivores from reproducing at all in the continuous presence of hipvs.

odour interactions can occur at various levels in the olfactory circuitry  <cit> . suppression of pheromone- and plant odour-evoked responses by dmnt appears to be a peripheral event, as evidenced by our single sensillum and ca2+ imaging recordings. suppression of osn input has been a frequently observed phenomenon in arthropods  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . in insects, suppression of pheromone antennal responses has long been documented  <cit> , and ever since several plant and microorganism odorants have been reported as suppressors of osn responses, for example, geraniol, linalool and β-ocimene. however, the majority of studies focussed on either behavioural responses or physiological mechanism of olfactory suppression, and few combined different approaches to finely elucidate the effect of olfactory coding on orientation and ecology  <cit> .

some possible mechanisms for response suppression include competitive antagonism  <cit> , allosteric inhibition  <cit> , presynaptic inhibition  <cit>  or ephaptic interactions  <cit> . the latter mechanism was demonstrated in d. melanogaster, in which the response of osns may inhibit the activity of sensilla co-located independently of synapses  <cit> . in our experiment using binary mixtures of plant odorants, -3-hexenyl acetate was the only component whose activity was significantly suppressed by dmnt. however, no sensillum type in s. littoralis was found responding to both compounds  <cit> . it is thus unlikely that dmnt suppresses odorant perception through ephaptic interaction. therefore, the mechanism behind dmnt-mediated osn suppression is likely competitive antagonism, allosteric inhibition  <cit>  or presynaptic inhibition  <cit> . the mode of interaction between dmnt and pheromone or plant odours is as of yet uncertain, but this interaction may also be peripheral and mediated through similar processes. to answer this question, a large deorphanization project on s. littoralis receptors will shed further light on this in the near future . it is important to note here that plant species differ in the precise ratio of terpenoids released as part of the hipv blend  <cit> . we anticipate that other terpenoids can substitute for the ecological role of dmnt, depending on the plant species.

the use of odours in ‘jamming’ olfactory perception has in recent years been explored in the context of combatting pest insects. a search for an olfactory receptor co-receptor  agonist and antagonist yielded several potential candidates for use in olfactory interference  <cit> . similarly, several agonist and antagonist receptors for carbon dioxide, a host-signifying compound for blood-seeking insects  <cit> , were successfully used in lowering biting incidence of mosquitoes under semi-field conditions  <cit> . here we demonstrate that jamming of olfactory perception also occurs naturally, as a part of olfactory coding of complex natural blends. in fact, it may well be a key component in the associational resistance in the push-pull cropping system in kenya  <cit> . intercropping of maize with melinis minutiflora  <cit> , intercrops that constitutively release dmnt, reduce maize borer chilo partellus infestations  <cit> . this may well be caused by dmnt-induced suppression of host plant attraction and sexual communication in c. partellus. this parallel seems warranted, given the fact that olfactory coding in related moths is highly similar  <cit> . dmnt is also critical in attraction of c. partellus parasitoids  <cit> . this suggests that in the maize intercropping system dmnt fulfils both a push and a pull function.

CONCLUSIONS
a single hipv, dmnt, affects olfactory-triggered orientation of carnivorous and herbivorous insects of both sexes and, therefore, has a central role in shaping tritrophic interactions. to disrupt olfactory coding, a specialized dedicated channel is not necessary to suppress signalling input of ecologically relevant odorants. further experiments should investigate whether this dmnt suppressive mechanism is conserved in other herbivore species. in addition, future studies should explore the potential application of dmnt, and possibly other hipvs that induce odour-based associational resistance, to improve push-pull methodology and support sustainable food production.
