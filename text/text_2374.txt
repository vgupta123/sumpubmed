BACKGROUND
copy number variations  are gains and losses of genetic material in the human genome that are greater than  <dig> base pairs  in size  <cit> . these structural variants are present in both healthy and diseased populations, and may confer susceptibility to certain illnesses through a gene dosage effect  <cit> . the frequency of cnvs varies by ethnicity, which may contribute to phenotypic variations and differences in disease susceptibility across different ethnic groups  <cit> . an array-based comparative genome hybridization  performed on pooled genomic dna from the international hapmap project populations revealed  <dig> european population-specific cnvs,  <dig> african population-specific cnvs, and  <dig> asian population-specific cnvs  <cit> . several technological approaches are used to examine cnvs in the human genome. comparative genomic hybridization techniques utilize thousands of probes to detect cnvs at a low resolution; single nucleotide polymorphism  microarray platforms employ millions of probes to detect smaller cnvs at precise locations in the genome; and the most comprehensive assessment of cnvs can be performed using next-generation sequencing of the human genome  <cit> . numerous algorithms have been developed for array based cnv detection using the probe signal intensity from these array-based assays  <cit> . the underlying assumption is that there are two copies of each autosomal chromosome in the human genome, and the goal of these algorithms is to estimate the size and location of regions which are significantly different from this assumption.

the statistical approaches implemented for the detection of cnvs are often performed on a sample-by-sample basis. a hidden markov model and bayesian analysis are statistical approaches commonly used for single-sample cnv calling  <cit> . we previously developed the genome alteration detection analysis  algorithm to identify cnvs on acgh and snp microarray platforms  <cit> . gada utilizes a sparse bayesian learning  technique to determine the possible cnv locations, and then a backward elimination  procedure is used to rank the cnvs for manual adjustment of the false discovery rate. the high accuracy and computational efficiency of gada has proven its utility in very large data sets used to identify global variation in copy number in the human genome  <cit> .

here we demonstrate a novel and simple method to detect common cnvs, which can then be used to build a common ancestry  signature that is predictive of ancestry. our method uses a simple application of the gada algorithm on a distribution of t-statistics obtained by comparing microarray probe signal intensity data of two different ancestral groups. the t-statistics arranged by the genomic locations of the probes allow detection of common genome-wide cnvs. next the copy number state of each individual is assessed for the cacnvs and used as features in a linear discriminant analysis model to identify a cacnv signature that can predict ancestry. lastly, we validated this cnv signature in an independent dataset of samples with similar ancestry.

methods
study populations
individuals of european, african, and han chinese ancestry were available from the international hapmap project  <cit> . genome-wide human snp array  <dig>   data for the hapmap individuals was obtained from affymetrix . the training set includes  <dig> unrelated hapmap individuals of european descent from utah ,  <dig> unrelated hapmap individuals of the african yoruba from nigeria , and  <dig> unrelated han chinese hapmap individuals from beijing, china .

the test set was obtained through the cancer genetic markers of susceptibility  project  <cit> . the cgems dataset was available from the national institute of general medical sciences  human genetic cell repository through dbgap . this is a population-based affy snp  <dig>  dataset of  <dig> samples  collected by the nigms to use as normal healthy controls . the ethnicities for the african-american and caucasian populations were self-identified as reported in physician records. the inclusion criteria for the han chinese cohort, obtained from subjects living in the los angeles area, were that all four grandparents were born in taiwan, china, or hong kong.

dna microarray
the affy snp  <dig>  consists of  <dig>  polymorphic probes for detection of snps and cnvs, and  <dig>  non-polymorphic probes for identification of cnvs only. the average minor allele frequency of snps on this platform in the hapmap ceu, chb, and yri populations is  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. cnv probes were originally selected for their genomic spacing  and based on known cnvs identified in the database of genomic variants . the median distance between all snp and cnv probes combined is <  <dig> base pairs  <cit> .

statistical analysis
dna microarray normalization and summarization
affy snp  <dig>  data were normalized according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and using genotyping console  <dig>  . quantile normalization, which corrects for fragment-size amplification and gc content, was performed on data from the training and test sets using the  <dig> hapmap samples processed at affymetrix, inc. as the reference group  <cit> . the result is a log2ratio, which is the logarithm of the signal intensity of the probe relative to the reference value. for each polymorphic snp probe, the log2ratio of the two alleles are summarized to produce a single log2ratio value; and one log2ratio value is estimated for each individual non-polymorphic cnv probe. the entire dataset was imported into r version  <dig> . <dig> . all the analyses were carried out in r and using r-gada package  <cit> .

identification of common cnvs using genome-wide t-statistics and gada
the underlying assumption for human dna copy number is that there are two autosomal copies of each chromosome, with an infrequent occurrence of nonrandom copy number gain and copy number loss throughout the genome. therefore, under the null hypothesis that most dna sequences consist of  <dig> copies, the probe signal intensities will follow an approximately normal distribution, with increases in probe signal intensity corresponding with copy number gains; and decreases with a corresponding copy number loss:

  yij=xij+eij 

where yij is the signal intensity of sample i and probe j.

because the normalization step corrects for experimental bias in probe signal intensities, the number of probes spanning a cnv will share a common mean log2ratio xij corresponding to the underlying dna copy number value. the noise eij is assumed to be zero-mean, and gaussian.

the t-test can be used to assess whether the mean measurements of two groups are statistically different from each other. here we use the t-test to determine whether the mean log2ratio in one population  is statistically different from the mean log2ratio in a second population .

  tj=y¯ja−y¯jbsj21na+1nb 

  si2=∑i∈ayij−y¯ia2+∑i∈byij−y¯ib2na+nb− <dig> 

  y¯ja=1na∑i∈ayijy¯jb=1nb∑i∈byij 

pair-wise comparisons of the microarray probe signal intensity data in ceu versus yri, ceu versus chb, and yri versus chb were performed using the t-test. this approach generated tj  for each of the  <dig>  million probes on the affy snp  <dig> . under the null hypothesis that two human populations will have most dna sequences in common, the t-statistics will asymptotically follow a normal distribution. the t-statistic will approximate zero for the two populations who share similar diploid genomes. a region with positive t-statistic scores would then correlate with a region showing evidence of copy number gain for one population, with the second population having either neutral or a loss of copy number for that region. conversely, regions with negative t-statistic scores will identify regions of the genome in which copy number loss is present in one population, and is absent or contains a copy number gain in the second population. to identify regions with positive or negative t-statistics, tj for the  <dig>  million snp and cnv probes are arranged based on the chromosome location and imported into gada.

the ordered t-statistics data were used to identify significant genomic boundaries of positive or negative tj values. these regions correspond to regions with discriminative copy number variations. the number of probes spanning a cnv region common to a population is assumed to share a common t-statistic value. therefore, the objective of gada is to identify the genome-wide cnvs which are most likely to be shared in one population, that also differ in another population. this is a simple modification of the gada method in which t-statistics are used in place of the log2ratios. the gada method consists of two main steps. the first step is a bayesian learning process which generates a set of candidate breakpoints and segment means while trying to achieve an optimal balance between model fit  and model sparseness . the bayesian learning process is driven by a prior parameter, which is determined by the amount of segmentation expected in the sample. following the initial segmentation process, the significance of each segment is estimated as a function of the segment mean and variance. the second step is then a backward elimination procedure which removes segments with a level of significance less than the user-predefined threshold. the prior parameter  was set to a =  <dig>  and the significance threshold  was set to t =  <dig> for identification of breakpoints. these estimates for the alpha and t were selected based on copy number analysis of affymetrix snp  <dig>  array data previously described and provided the most parsimonious model  <cit> . further, only significant segments with greater than  <dig> probes were selected for the analysis to decrease the potential for false positive results.

building the cacnv signature
for each cnvk segment identified by gada using the t-statistic data, the sum of the log2ratio values of the total number of probes spanning the k-th cnv was calculated for each individual in the training set. thus each person was assigned a vector of features, and for the k-th cnv and the i-th individual:

  fik=∑k∈cnvkyij 

we then used a variation of the linear discriminant analysis  approach, named nearest shrunken centroids, to identify which of these cnv features are cacnvs that can accurately be used to predict the ancestry of two defined populations. briefly, the method computes a standardized centroid for each class, and then a weighted discriminant is computed to assess if each sample leans towards one population or the other. the shrunken centroid method has been implemented as an r package  and used for this analysis  <cit> . finally, a ten-fold cross validation was performed on the training set to estimate the performance of the model. the t-statistics were calculated and cnv models were identified during each iteration of the cross-validation routine, without splitting the parent-offspring trios.

validation
validation of the cacnv signature was performed using the independent cgems test set, with the log2ratio sum for each sample calculated using the affy snp  <dig>  probes spanning the cacnv derived from the training set. the self-reported ethnicities of the test set were compared to a principal component analysis  of genome-wide snp data using a panel of  <dig>  snps previously published as ancestry informative markers  for african americans  <cit> . admixture version  <dig>  software was used to estimate ancestry using a model-based approach from the same panel of snps  <cit> . 

RESULTS
identification of cacnvs
in order to identify common cnvs that differ between two populations, a series of t-tests were performed on the mean log2ratio for each affy snp  <dig>  probe comparing ceu, yri, and chb populations . gada analysis of the t-statistic values of each pair-wise analysis, ordered based on the genomic location of its corresponding probe, identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cacnvs, respectively, which differed between training set populations of ceu and yri ancestry, ceu and chb ancestry, and chb and yri ancestry . a pca of the cacnv values for each individual in the pair-wise comparisons verified the separation of these three populations . of the  <dig> total cacnvs identified by the three pair-wise comparisons,  <dig> cacnvs were common in analyses comparing the yri to the ceu or chb populations, and  <dig> cacnvs were common comparing ceu or chb against the other two populations, resulting in  <dig> unique cacnvs in the signature . scatter plots of the top two principal components in the pca of the  <dig> cacnv values generated for each individual in the training set verified the separation of these three populations . the median genomic size of the cacnv signature was  <dig>  kilobases . the cacnvs were located on all autosomal chromosomes except for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the distribution of copy number gains and losses of the  <dig> cacnvs across individuals of the three ancestral groups. among the cacnvs, losses were more commonly observed across the three populations. the individual cnvs detected for each sample are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

cacnv signature-based ancestry classification
nearest shrunken centroid analysis using the  <dig> cacnv signature in the training set separated the ceu, yri, and chb populations with  <dig> % error using the ten-fold cross-validation routine . as few as  <dig> cacnvs could be used to predict ancestry with less than 10% error. the most significant cacnv was located in chromosome 4q <dig> , with 43%, 60%, and 4% of the ceu, yri, and chb populations exhibiting copy number gains; and 10%, 4%, and 73% with copy number losses. this region encompassing the udp-glucuronosyltransferase 2b <dig>  gene has previously been reported to be deleted in east asian populations by dna sequencing  <cit> . the second most significant cacnv was located on chromosome 3q <dig>  and contains only a microrna . the third most significant cacnv is a duplicated region of chromosome 17q <dig>  found only in europeans, which has been validated experimentally by fluorescence in situ hybridization  and next-generation sequencing techniques  <cit> .

independent validation of the cacnv signature
the entire test set of  <dig> han chinese samples,  <dig> out of the  <dig> african-american samples, and  <dig> out of the  <dig> european samples were correctly classified using the  <dig> cacnv signature, with overall misclassification error rate of 2% . pca was performed on a panel of  <dig>  genome-wide snps used as aims to verify the separation of these three populations by self-reported ancestry   <cit> . to further investigate the effects of admixture on classification, admixture version  <dig>  software was used to estimate ancestry using a model-based approach from the same aims panel of  <dig>  snps  <cit> . the estimates of ancestry for each individual using the cacnv signature and genome-wide snps were correlated in the han chinese , europeans , and african-americans , confirming the accuracy of the cacnv signature .

discussion
this study shows a novel methodology for identifying a common cnv signature that could predict ancestry with an extremely high accuracy. our  <dig> cacnv signature distinguishes european, african, and han chinese ancestry with an error rate of only 2%. in our signature, we also report the identification of the first microrna cacnv. importantly, our approach is applicable to a wide range of biomedical research aimed at identifying cnv signatures predictive of population phenotypes.

existing methods for cnv detection are often performed on a sample-by-sample basis, which is not ideal for large datasets where common cnvs must be estimated by comparing the cnvs of the individual samples. our proposed method identifies population-level cnvs using an application of our published gada method. common cnvs are determined directly from the t-statistics estimated by comparing the microarray probe signal intensities of populations of different ancestry. when used in a linear discriminant analysis model, a subset of  <dig> cnvs could accurately predict population structure. the average vst for the cacnvs identified in our study was  <dig>  . vst calculations range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the distribution of cnvs in the human genome has previously been shown to vary by ethnic populations  <cit> . in total, 53/ <dig>  cacnvs discovered using our method has previously been identified as population differentiated. our method identified  <dig> cacnvs which overlapped with a human cnv map previously developed using the same hapmap populations  <cit> . many of the cacnvs we discovered have previously been validated experimentally . for instance,  <dig> of the cacnvs in our signature were previously reported as population differentiated using the hapmap samples using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  <cit> . we have also identified cacnvs on chromosomes 4q <dig> , 16p <dig> , 17p <dig> , 17q <dig> and 17q <dig>  that have been confirmed by dna sequencing  <cit> . in addition to sequencing, the cacnv on chromosome 17q <dig>  has been validated using fish analysis and the cacnv on chromosome 17q <dig> was validated using quantitative pcr  <cit> . the most significant cacnv we identified in our analysis was on chromosome 4q <dig> . this region encompassing the ugt 2b <dig> gene shows exceptionally increased population variation, and is most frequently deleted in east asian populations  <cit> . another significant cacnv in our analysis was in the region of chromosome 3q <dig> . w report a copy number loss in 80% of the han chinese population, which is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . this region contains only a microrna  that has been shown to be expressed in melanocytes and melanoma  <cit> . finally, we demonstrate novel cacnvs located throughout the genome on chromosomes 3p <dig> , 3q <dig> , 3q <dig> , 4p <dig> ,7q <dig> , 8p <dig> , and 14q <dig> .

our approach in building a common cnv signature has several advantages. first, the proposed t-test approach is a quick and simple method to identify regions of dna copy number which are significantly different in two populations. the gada prior parameters provide users the flexibility to control sensitivity and specificity in identifying boundaries of common cnvs on the t-statistic data. these adjustments can be made in real-time as only one dataset  is analyzed in gada. in comparison, the significance testing for aberrant copy number  algorithm creates a binary matrix from the normalized microarray probe signal intensities of individual samples, assigning genomic regions with no copy number change to zero and genomic regions with copy number gains or losses to one. regions of copy number variation are then determined by their length and frequency of occurrence. stac uses non-overlapping windows to search for evidence of cnvs in each chromosome, which can be computationally expensive when using small window sizes. mei et al. ran the stac algorithm longer than  <dig> hours on a  <dig> ghz windows pc with  <dig> gb of ram to analyze > <dig>  non-overlapping windows of chromosomes 1– <dig> of  <dig> hapmap samples  <cit> . while gada provides significant speed and flexibility in controlling for false discovery rate, the breakpoint detection analysis of the t-statistics values could be accomplished using other approaches such as circularly binary segmentation. another advantage of our approach is the elimination of data reduction techniques such as principal component analyses to identify common cnvs or the use of principal component values as features in a classifier algorithm  <cit> . through our simple procedure, common cnv signatures can be identified that can be readily applied to other datasets with similar data types as demonstrated with our use of a test set in this report. these advantages along with our reported and validated cacnv signature gives credence to our novel approach which could also easily be implemented to identify cnvs as susceptibility loci in case–control studies.

admixture in the test set is a possible limitation of our study. admixture was expected in african-american cohort, and the probabilities of identifying african ancestry in the test set was lower than that obtained in our training set. nonetheless, we showed high correlation between the estimated posterior probability of ancestry from the cacnv signature to estimates of admixture from genome-wide snp data using admixture software.

application of common cnvs can complement informative snps in ancestral studies or case–control studies. common cnvs may encompass genes giving rise to the observed phenotype, and do not necessarily rely on linkage disequilibrium with the underlying causal variant. the likelihood of gene dosage effects of cnvs can also provide insight to the biological differences observed between populations. finally, future studies could explore the combination of cnvs and snps to identify population stratification.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we described a new methodology to identify common cnvs and demonstrated its performance by building a cacnv signature to predict human ancestry. our novel approach reveals a  <dig> cacnv signature, which 73% of the cacnvs have been confirmed by other approaches and can be used to infer human population structure with extremely high accuracy. a simple modification of the gada method allowed for direct segmentation of t-statistics to identify the cacnvs. the efficiency of our method in finding cnv signatures will facilitate the use of a new type of structural variation important in human genomic studies. the success of our methodology has implications for improving admixture mapping and the minimization of population stratification in case–control and genome-wide association studies. this methodology can be easily expanded to large studies aimed to identify a genetic susceptibility cnv signature specific to other phenotypes such as disease or drug response.
