BACKGROUND
accurate estimates of object size play an essential role in guiding our daily actions such as picking up a coffee cup and walking through a door. however, the perceived size of objects not only depends on their physical size but also on the surroundings in which they appear. size illusions arise when the surroundings interact with our perception of the objects and lead to misjudgements of the size of the objects. for example, when two identical objects are placed in a context that suggests they are located at different distances from the observer , the contextually more distant object appears to be larger than the closer one, as a result of the assumption incorporated by the visual system about the distance of each object from the observer. a similarly illusory perception of object size occurs in the ebbinghaus illusion , in which the size of items immediately surrounding an object determines whether the object is perceived to be larger or smaller than its physical size. a surround containing small items makes the object appear larger and vice versa. these size illusions not only trick our visual system but also distort our action, such that the grasping aperture will reflect the perceptual size instead of the physical size of an object  <cit> .

although the visual system has been intensively studied and a lot is known about the processing of simple object features such as orientation, luminance, colour, motion, and shape, surprisingly little is known about the neural processes underlying size perception. the spatial extent of neural activity in human primary visual cortex  reflects the perceived size rather than the physical size of an object in a ponzo-like illusion  <cit> , suggesting a possible role for v <dig> in illusory size perception. the geniculostriate visual pathway is segregated into monocular pathways from the left and right eyes. the first stage at which information from the two eyes converges is v <dig>  but it nonetheless contains populations of monocular neurons, which respond, with varying degree of exclusivity, to direct stimulation from only one of the eyes  <cit> . therefore, it is unclear whether binocular or monocular neuronal populations of v <dig> are involved in the perception of the ponzo illusion. moreover, it remains unknown whether other forms of illusory size perception such as the ebbinghaus illusion are mediated by the same or different neuronal mechanisms. the ponzo and the ebbinghaus illusions are induced by spatial contexts suggesting a role for different types of contextual information. while the contexts in the ponzo illusion  contain monocular depth clues that globally affect both objects, the contexts in the ebbinghaus illusion  are simple geometric patterns that locally affect the adjacent object but not the other object. such discrepancy between the two illusions may be associated with the involvement of different neuronal populations.

here we studied the extent to which monocular and binocular neurons in the human visual system were involved in two different size illusions: the ponzo illusion and the ebbinghaus illusion. we took advantage of the well-described functional organization of the visual system to infer the cortical stage at which the illusory size perception occurred. in visual cortices beyond v <dig> almost all neurons are binocular, whereas in subcortical visual areas  and v <dig> a large proportion of neurons are monocular. interocular transfer paradigms can reveal the degree of binocularity in illusory size perception and allow us to make inferences concerning the neuronal populations or neural stages involved  <cit> . if a spatial context in one eye exerts an influence on the perceived size of an object presented to the other eye, this suggests that the illusory size perception is mediated by binocular neurons at v <dig> or higher visual areas. conversely, if the process is substantially reduced under dichoptic presentation , this implicates the involvement of monocular neurons early in the visual system such as at lateral geniculate nucleus  or v <dig> 

we therefore devised stimuli in which an object and its spatial context associated with a size illusion could be presented together to one eye  or separately to the two different eyes . in separate experiments, we quantified the magnitude of illusory size perception induced by the two different  illusions, and examined how the magnitude of the illusion was affected  by these interocular manipulations. we found that the ponzo illusion showed equivalent magnitudes in dichoptic and monocular presentations, but the ebbinghaus illusion in contrast was much weaker in dichoptic compared to monocular presentation.

RESULTS
we studied the two illusions under monocular, dichoptic, and binocular conditions: the spatial contexts were presented to only one eye, and the objects were presented to either the same eye , or the opposite eye , or to both eyes simultaneously . contrasting the monocular and dichoptic conditions allowed us to evaluate the degree of interocular transfer in illusory size perception, whereas contrasting the binocular condition with the monocular and dichoptic conditions allowed us to infer the linearity vs. nonlinearity of the interocular transfer effect. for a better comparison of the ebbinghaus and the ponzo illusions, we matched the spatial configuration of the two illusion stimuli by using a horizontal configuration for the ponzo illusion . we also studied the vertical configuration of the ponzo illusion  to generalize the findings.

the ponzo illusion persisted under all three conditions of stimulus presentation  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; dichoptic, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; binocular, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; vertical ponzo illusion; monocular, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; dichoptic, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; binocular, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; right tailed t-test). however, the magnitude of the illusion changed over different conditions  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; vertical ponzo illusion, f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; one-way repeated measures anova). the illusion magnitude was the same when the objects and the contexts were presented to the same eye or to different eyes  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; vertical ponzo illusion, t = - <dig> , p =  <dig> ; paired t-test), but decreased when the objects were presented to both eyes simultaneously  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; vertical ponzo illusion, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; binocular vs. dichoptic: horizontal ponzo illusion, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; vertical ponzo illusion, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; paired t-test). to infer the linearity of interocular transfer in illusory size perception, a regression model b =β <dig> *  +β <dig> * m * d  was used to fit the data. results suggested that the interaction between the monocular and dichoptic conditions under the ponzo illusion was nonlinear .

similar to the ponzo illusion, the ebbinghaus illusion persisted regardless of the type of interocular manipulation  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; dichoptic, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; binocular, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; right tailed t-test), but changed in magnitude across different manipulations  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , one-way repeated measures anova). interestingly, the change in the magnitude of the ebbinghaus illusion showed a very different pattern from that of the ponzo illusion. presenting the objects and their spatial contexts to different eyes greatly weakened the ebbinghaus illusion  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; paired t-test). further, when the objects were presented to both eyes simultaneously and the contexts to only one eye, the ebbinghaus illusion had an intermediate magnitude  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; binocular vs. dichoptic, t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; paired t-test), and the regression model suggested a linear interaction between the monocular and dichoptic conditions .

the different interocular transfer patterns in the two illusions suggested that they have different underlying mechanisms. further intra-individual comparisons showed that while the magnitudes of the horizontal and the vertical ponzo illusion are strongly correlated , there is no correlation between the magnitudes of the ebbinghaus and the ponzo illusion .

discussion
our study suggests that two well-known size illusions - the ebbinghaus illusion and the ponzo illusion - arise from different neuronal mechanisms. the ponzo illusion showed complete interocular transfer; that is, the strength of the illusion was equivalent regardless of whether the inducing spatial context was presented to the same or different eye as the objects whose perceived size participants were asked to judge. conversely, in a similar configuration there was significantly reduced interocular transfer for the ebbinghaus illusion. the complete interocular transfer observed in the ponzo illusion indicates that it is mediated by binocular neuronal populations where visual inputs from the two eyes are combined and the information about the eye of origin is lost. the induction of the ebbinghaus illusion magnitude from monocular to dichoptic presentation indicates that it is in large part mediated by monocular neuronal populations. thus, the neural mechanism underlying illusory size perception is likely to depend on the type of spatial contexts in which the objects appear.

in the early visual system, inputs from the left and right eye are clearly segregated, up until v <dig> where there exist neuronal populations with varying degrees of binocularity  <cit> . a dichoptically presented stimulus will drive responses in neurons exclusively responsive to the same eye , as well as binocular neurons but with a decreasing degree depending on their ocular dominance. the weak interocular transfer that we observed for the ebbinghaus illusion is therefore an indication that this illusion could be mediated by v <dig> or even earlier in the geniculostriate pathway  where the majority of the neurons are monocular. in contrast, the full interocular transfer that we observed with the ponzo illusion provides strong evidence that this form of illusory size perception reflects activity in visual areas at least as high as v <dig> 

the conclusion that the two illusions have different underlying neural mechanisms is further supported by the intra-individual comparisons that showed a lack of correlation between the magnitudes of each illusion across individuals. moreover, when a regression model was used to fit individual illusion magnitudes under different interocular manipulations, this suggested a linear interocular interaction in the ebbinghaus illusion but a nonlinear interaction in the ponzo illusion. the ebbinghaus illusion magnitude under binocular conditions reflected a linear combination of that under monocular and dichoptic conditions, whereas in the ponzo illusion a nonlinear combination was present. such differences are also indicative of a monocular component in the ebbinghaus illusion and a binocular component in the ponzo illusion. since monocular signals from the two eyes are subjective to nonlinear neural processing in binocular summation  <cit> , the nonlinearity in the ponzo illusion suggests that the illusory size perception here takes place at or after the stage of binocular summation. at this stage, the illusion inducers, as inputs from a single eye, are weaker than the binocular inputs of objects, leading to the induction of illusion magnitude from monocular/dichoptic to binocular condition. in contrast, the linearity in the ebbinghaus illusion indicates that the illusion takes effect separately at different monocular channels before binocular summation.

the discrepancy between the ponzo and the ebbinghaus illusion may be largely due to the difference in the spatial contexts that induce the illusory perception. while the contexts in the ponzo illusion suggest three-dimensional depth/distance information, the contexts in the ebbinghaus illusion are simple geometric forms/contours. although the slant contexts in the ponzo illusion are monocular rather than binocular depth clues, it is plausible that the processing of monocular depth clues also requires the engagement of binocular neurons  <cit>  as does the processing of binocular disparity clues  <cit> . the simple geometric contexts in the ebbinghaus illusion, on the other hand, are likely to be processed already in v <dig> where a large proportion of neurons are monocular  <cit> . notably, the contexts in the ponzo illusion globally affect both objects, whereas the contexts in the ebbinghaus illusion locally affect the adjacent object but not the other object. as the receptive fields of neurons increase significantly in size along the visual pathway  <cit> , the processing of global contexts are likely to be mediated by higher visual areas where the neuronal receptive fields are large, and that of local contexts may be mediated by neurons with small receptive fields in lower visual areas. thus, the different cognitive natures of the two illusions may be the underlying cause of the different neuronal involvements.

interestingly, similarly to our findings in the ebbinghaus illusion, other contextual effects such as collinear facilitation  <cit>  and the tilt illusion  <cit>  also exhibit partial interocular transfer. in collinear facilitation, the threshold for detecting a low contrast gabor patch is enhanced when it is flanked by two higher contrast patches sharing the same orientation  <cit> . in the tilt illusion, the perceived orientation of a central grating is biased by the orientation of the surrounding grating  <cit> . both of these illusions are dependent on the local contexts of stimulus orientation, a feature known to be processed by v <dig> neurons  <cit> . the lateral intrinsic connections in v <dig>  <cit>  which link neurons with similar receptive field properties  <cit>  are hypothesized to modulate such contextual influences on visual perception  <cit> . it is conceivable that the ebbinghaus illusion also depends on these lateral connections.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that monocular and binocular processing is involved in different ways in two phenomenally similar size illusions. while the ponzo illusion was completely binocular and may largely involve higher visual areas, the ebbinghaus illusion was primarily mediated by monocular pathways and therefore probably arises in primary visual cortex or subcortical visual areas. these findings suggest that the extent to which different neuronal populations are involved in illusory size perception is dependent on the spatial contexts in which the objects appear. this raises the possibility that different types of size illusions will affect our visually guided actions and interact with other visual pathways  in different ways. such topics would be of interest for future study.
