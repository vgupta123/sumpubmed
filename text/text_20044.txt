BACKGROUND
adult mosquitoes feed on sugar to obtain energy for flight and other activities, while anautogenous females need a blood meal to develop eggs. salivary glands and the saliva of insect disease vectors have attracted considerable attention because of their role in pathogen transmission and their production of pharmacologically active factors  <cit> .

it is during the blood-feeding process that the plasmodium parasite is taken up from an infected a. gambiae host. once inside the mosquito, plasmodium undergoes several developmental transitions and eventually becomes a sporozoite, which invades the salivary glands. this invasion represents a critical step in the transmission of the parasite to the vertebrate host. completion of the infection depends on the injection of sporozoites, through the saliva, into the host's skin and leaving the inoculation site rapidly to enter and invade the liver for further development  <cit> .

unlike male salivary glands, female mosquito salivary glands possess anti-hemostatic, vasodilatory and immune-modulatory factors to facilitate the acquisition of blood, while salivary glands of both sexes have activity related to the digestion of the sugar meal as well as antimicrobials to prevent microbial growth  <cit> . mosquitoes have been shown to require longer probing times during blood-feeding when an apyrase gene  has been silenced, or if they are deprived of salivation by removal of the salivary duct through which the saliva is transported to the probing site  <cit> . silencing of another a. gambiae salivary gland gene, sg <dig> , results in increased probing time and reduced blood-feeding ability  <cit> . previous studies have shown that several anopheles salivary gland proteins are reduced after blood-feeding, suggesting that these major polypeptides may have been introduced into the vertebrate hosts during the blood meal  <cit> . there is evidence that the pharmacological activity of arthropod saliva affects pathogen transmission and the local inflammatory response of the host. for example, the salivary gland lysate from the sand fly lutzomyia longipalpis facilitates the infection of mice by the protozoan parasite leishmania major  <cit> . it has also been shown that the l. longipalpis salivary gland lysate inhibits neutrophil migration and the th <dig> immune inflammatory response. these findings suggest that the compounds responsible for such activities could be used for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs  <cit> .

while earlier sialo-transcriptomic studies have identified a variety of salivary gland genes,  <cit> , we present the first global microarray transcriptome analysis of the a. gambiae salivary gland under conditions related to feeding. earlier studies have identified some  <dig>  adult female a. gambiae salivary gland-transcribed sequence tags and  <dig>  genes were found to be transcribed in the larval gland  <cit> , of which  <dig> were specific for this tissue. here we report  <dig>  adult female a. gambiae salivary gland transcripts, as defined by oligonucleotide microarray gene transcription analysis. we show that  <dig> and  <dig> salivary gland-expressed transcripts were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, at  <dig> hours after blood-feeding when compared to salivary glands of unfed mosquitoes. we have also used an rnai-mediated gene silencing approach to assess the potential involvement of  <dig> selected salivary gland genes in regulating mosquito blood-feeding capacity. silencing of several salivary gland transcripts; d7l <dig>  anophelin, peroxidase, 5'nucleotidase and sg <dig> precursor, produced a significantly lowered blood-feeding phenotype and increased probing time, confirming that these genes may be playing an important role in blood-feeding. the updated list of the a. gambiae salivary gland transcriptome, together with the results of our comprehensive functional analyses, can facilitate the discovery of novel pharmacologically active compounds and provide tools for the development of malaria control strategies.

RESULTS
the a. gambiae salivary gland transcriptome
in order to characterize the a. gambiae female salivary gland transcriptome, we employed a microarray-based genome transcription approach to compare the transcript abundance in the salivary glands at  <dig> hours after blood feeding to salivary glands of unfed female mosquitoes. the relative transcript abundance of salivary gland expressed genes was analyzed by sorting the blood-fed versus unfed salivary gland transcripts into three different categories based on their corresponding spot fluorescence intensities . of the total predicted transcriptome ;  <dig>  genes  genes were found to be transcribed in the salivary gland of 4-day-old a. gambiae female mosquitoes. of these,  <dig> transcripts  were considered as highly abundant ;  <dig> transcripts  were considered as moderately present , and  <dig>  transcripts  were considered as being present at low levels based on spot intensity .

we analyzed the predicted functional class composition of each category  to gain insight into the major processes that take place in the female mosquito's salivary glands upon blood-feeding.

cytoskeletal and structural genes
several cytoskeletal and structural gene transcripts  were identified in the salivary glands . one of the most abundant transcripts encoded a mucin, a secretory protein that has been shown to be a major protein in the salivary gland lysate of several mosquito species  <cit> . this protein may function as a lubricant of the mosquito mouthparts and has been proposed to bind to the chitinous linings of the salivary ducts and mouthparts  <cit> . three mucin encoding transcripts have been identified in the a. gambiae larval salivary gland  <cit> , suggesting the importance of mucins at multiple developmental stages. we have further investigated the function of one of the mucin gene  by assaying changes in the feeding and probing behavior of mosquitoes after its depletion through rnai . in addition, saglin  was shown to be an abundant transcript in the salivary gland. saglin encodes for a secretory protein  that has been shown to bind to the plasmodium berghei sporozoite protein thrombospondin related anonymous protein , and play a crucial role in salivary gland invasion by sporozoites,  <cit> . the presence of transcripts such as actin, chitin binding, cuticlar protein, myosin, laminin, tropomysin, tubulin, annexin, dynein light chain, connectin, dynactin, cadherin, and myosin muscle suggests that these genes play a significant housekeeping role in the a. gambiae salivary gland.

genes involved in protein and sugar digestion
as many as  <dig> genes putatively involved in protein and sugar digestion were found to be transcribed in the a. gambiae salivary glands;  <dig> of these transcripts were highly abundant,  <dig> were moderately present and  <dig> were present at low levels . many of these transcripts coding for proteases  and glycosidases  have a secretory signal peptide sequence.

salivary gland glycosidases have been shown to be involved in the digestion of sugar, whereas the proteolytic enzymes could be involved in host-specific proteolytic events  that occur during the blood-feeding process. it is also possible that these proteolytic enzymes, which are secreted in the saliva, are ingested along with the blood, and might be involved in its digestion. proteins encoded by transcripts that lack signal peptide sequences are most likely involved in housekeeping functions in the salivary gland or may be secreted by an alternative non-classical method  <cit> . the majority of these genes are also transcribed in the a. gambiae midgut and other tissues as well as during other developmental stages as has been demonstrated in earlier studies  <cit> . the proteolytic digestive enzymes in the midgut are mainly involved in the digestion of blood.

circadian and chemosensory genes
two circadian system-related genes, takeout and timeless, were weakly transcribed in the salivary gland. takeout has been shown to act as a molecular link between circadian rhythm and feeding behavior in drosophila melanogaster and a. gambiae  <cit> , and timeless is a transcription factor that plays a major role in circadian regulation  <cit> . the timeless transcript has been identified previously in the a. gambiae female salivary gland  <cit> ; however, we report for the first time the expression of takeout in this tissue.

several genes with putative chemosensory functions, such as odorant binding proteins , odorant receptors, antennal carrier protein, arrestins, gustatory receptors, and pheromone binding proteins, were transcribed in the a. gambiae salivary gland . obps are mainly localized in the mosquito head and within the antennae, where they function as carriers of odorants to the olfactory receptors  <cit> . the d <dig> family of proteins are distantly related to the obp super-family, because of the conserved 6-cysteine and 10-cysteine residues and a characteristic fold structure  <cit> . however, the obps function as odorant carriers  <cit> , whereas d <dig> proteins have been proposed to inhibit hemostasis by trapping agonists of hemostasis  <cit> , and thereby facilitate blood-feeding by hematophagous vectors .

d <dig> protein family genes
the four highly transcribed members of the a. gambiae d <dig> family were the d7r- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> precursors  and the d <dig> long form l <dig>  , whereas the d7r- <dig>   <dig> precursors  and another d <dig> long form l <dig>  were found to be only moderately/weakly transcribed in the salivary glands  . the d <dig> gene  was first identified in a. aegypti  <cit>  as a major salivary gland secretory protein. the d <dig> protein exists in two forms: a long form , which is found exclusively in mosquitoes and sand-flies, and the short forms , which are found in other insects  <cit> . five different d7-related  short forms and three d <dig> long forms have been identified in the a. gambiae adult salivary gland  <cit> . in  <dig>  calvo et al. proposed that d7-related proteins from blood-sucking insects act as anti-hemostatic factors by trapping agonists of hemostasis. one short d <dig> protein from a. stephensi, hamadarin , has been shown to inhibit the plasma contact system by preventing the activation of kallikrein by factor xiia  <cit> . the d7r <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and d <dig> long forms have been shown to bind to the biogenic amines serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine  <cit> . the crystal structures of one member of the d <dig> family, d7r <dig> , and those of the ligand complexes were determined in order to elucidate the mechanisms governing its anti-hemostatic and anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . it has been suggested that the ancestral d <dig> has originated from the proteins of the obp family, which were adapted to bind small hydrophobic ligands  <cit> . we have further investigated the function of this family by looking at the changes in feeding and probing behavior of mosquitoes after silencing of the two d <dig> long forms, d <dig> l <dig> and d <dig> l <dig> .

immunity- and stress-related genes
transcripts representing  <dig> immune genes  were found to be expressed in the a. gambiae female salivary glands . these genes included: lysozyme, gram negative bacteria binding protein , the anti-microbial peptides cecropin and defensin, the nfκb transcription factors rel <dig> and rel <dig>  a c-type lectin , galectins, several fibrinogen binding proteins , serpins, thioester containing proteins , a caspase, socs, toll, myd- <dig>  a leucine rich receptor , a scavenger receptor, a prophenoloxidase , and others. immune genes such as c-type lectins, prophenoloxidase activating enzymes, galectins, v <dig> allergens, and lysozyme were identified in the a. gambiae salivary gland  <cit>  and in another study, it was shown that gnbp, defensin, putative gal-lectin, and putative serine protease transcripts were up-regulated in the a. gambiae salivary gland after plasmodium berghei infection  <cit> . in a more recent sage analysis of the a. gambiae salivary gland transcriptome upon p. berghei infection;  <dig> immune related genes were identified and four of them  were up-regulated during salivary gland invasion by the sporozoites  <cit> .

several of these immune genes encode secretory proteins, including gnbps, several fbns, the short antimicrobial peptides, pgrps, chitinase, and lectins. till date, little is known about the role of these immune genes in the a. gambiae female salivary gland, or whether they are directly involved in anti-plasmodium or anti-microbial defenses. the secretory immune proteins may also be involved in protective immunity against microbes or other pathogens with which the mosquitoes come into direct contact during feeding. in the larval salivary gland, three defensins, three fibrinogen binding proteins, one clipb <dig>  and four serine proteases have been detected  <cit> . three different chitinase transcripts have been detected in a. gambiae larval salivary glands  <cit>  and have been proposed to protect against pathogenic bacteria and fungi derived from the mosquitoes' diet  <cit> . of the three different lysozyme transcripts detected in this study, one  was also detected in the salivary gland of larvae  <cit> . lysozyme might be involved in preventing the growth of microbes in the sugar meal that is ingested with saliva and stored in the mosquito crop  <cit> . most of these immune genes are also transcribed in other tissues, where they are involved in limiting bacterial and parasite growth  <cit> . warr and coworkers  <cit>  have shown that the cardia and anterior part of the midgut transcribe most of the antimicrobial peptides and other anti-plasmodium factors.

among the genes involved in oxidoreductive, antioxidant, and stress-related processes in a. gambiae,  <dig> transcripts were found to be present in the salivary glands  . this group was composed of several cytochrome p <dig> enzymes, glutathione s-transferase, cytochrome c oxidase, nadh ubiquinone, dnaj homolog, oxidoreductase, animal heme peroxidase, thiorededoxin  <dig>  mitochondrial inner membrane protein, and many others. some of these transcripts have been identified earlier in salivary gland est libraries or in other studies of different mosquito species  <cit>  and are involved in housekeeping functions of the salivary gland. several transcripts coding for heat-shock proteins  were found to be transcribed in the female salivary gland. hsps belong to a family of proteins that function as chaperones or are involved in cellular defense against external stress from various sources  <cit> .

metabolism and other enzyme genes
as many as  <dig> transcripts  of genes putatively involved in metabolism and other enzymatic activities were found to be transcribed in the salivary gland of a. gambiae . among the transcripts encoding putative secretory enzymes, three members of the 5' nucleotidase gene family; an apyrase precursor , and two 5' nucleotidase precursors  were found to be transcribed in the adult salivary gland . the apyrase and one of the 5' nucleotidase precursors  have been shown to be components of saliva  <cit> . the second 5' nucleotidase precursor gene contains a secretory signal sequence, suggesting potential involvement in feeding. of these three 5' nucleotidase gene family transcripts, the agap011026-ra was highly expressed, and the other two were moderately expressed. enzymes of this family facilitate the acquisition of blood meals by removing and degrading pharmacologically active atp/adp nucleotides from the site of the injury  <cit> .

silencing of an apyrase gene in the salivary gland of a. gambiae resulted in an increase in the mosquito probing time as well as increase in vitro platelet aggregation  <cit> . we have further investigated the function of this gene family by assaying changes in the feeding and probing behavior of mosquitoes after silencing the 5' nucleotidase precursor transcript  . some of the metabolic enzymes with a signal peptide sequence include alpha amylase  and alpha glucosidase , which are weakly transcribed in the female salivary glands. the transcript glycohydrolase , which is weakly transcribed in the a. gambiae salivary gland, also encodes a secretory protein and belongs to a large family with diverse functions reflecting their amino acid sequences: chitosanase, and nad+ glycohydrolase, among many others  <cit> .

genes of other functional groups
several genes involved in housekeeping functions and belonging to the replication-transcription-translation  and transport functional groups  were found to be transcribed in the a. gambiae salivary gland . in the replication-transcription-translation group, genes including several ribosomal proteins, histones, elongation factors, repressors, activators, proteasome subunits, and enzymes such as helicase, ligase, polymerase, dna repair, ribonuclease, and many other enzymes were found to be transcribed. in the transport group, transcripts such as vesicle transport protein, solute carrier protein, ion transporter, ion channels, apolipophorin precursor, aquaporin water channel, and many others were found to be transcribed. several transcripts  were found to be transcribed and were placed in the diverse group  because of their assorted roles and various functions. the presence of vitellogenin precursor transcripts is likely to indicate contamination with fat body which is attached to the salivary glands.

a study recently showed that silencing of sg <dig> transcript results in an increased probing time and reduced feeding ability in a. gambiae female mosquitoes  <cit> . in this study we have investigated the function of the sg <dig> transcript , by assaying changes in the feeding and probing behavior of mosquitoes after its depletion . the sg <dig> protein precursor, a secretory protein, was found to be highly transcribed in the salivary gland; sg <dig> protein family members have molecular masses around 44·kda and do not exhibit significant similarities  <cit>  to other proteins in the ncbi database, with the exception of the anopheline distantly related trio protein   <cit> , when analyzed by blast analysis. transcripts of unknown function or with no homology to known protein were assigned to the group of unknown . further studies are required to link these transcripts with specific roles of salivation, feeding, blood digestion, and storage in a. gambiae.

regulation of a. gambiae salivary gland transcripts upon blood-feeding
we have performed a microarray-based gene transcription analysis of the blood-feeding-regulated genes in the a. gambiae salivary gland. we compared the transcriptome of the a. gambiae salivary glands at  <dig> h after blood-feeding to salivary glands of unfed mosquitoes to identify salivary gland transcripts that are likely to play a role, either directly or indirectly, in the feeding process. previous studies have shown that salivary gland proteins are rapidly depleted during feeding and that this depletion is proportional to the duration of feeding. since blood fed mosquitoes are capable of taking a second blood-meal already at  <dig> hours after the first feeding, we hypothesized that the replenishment of the salivary gland proteins must initiate soon after feeding, and therefore selected a  <dig> hour time point after feeding to assay blood feeding-related changes in the salivary gland transcriptome  <cit> . genome-wide microarray analysis of gene expression responses to blood feeding has been performed previously but for whole female a. gambiae mosquitoes  <cit> , whereas our study is exclusively for the female salivary glands.

the resulting catalog of transcripts that exhibited differences in abundance prior and after blood feeding in the a. gambiae salivary gland is presented in additional file  <dig>  in total,  <dig> transcripts were differentially regulated;  <dig> transcripts were more abundant and  <dig> transcripts were less abundant after blood-feeding . marinotti et al. showed in  <dig> that some  <dig>  transcripts, derived from whole mosquitoes displayed changes in abundance within  <dig> hour after blood-meal;  <dig>  genes were up-regulated while  <dig>  genes were down-regulated  <cit> . the salivary gland expressed transcripts that were significantly regulated by blood-feeding are presented in table  <dig> .

the ensembl transcript ids have been shortened by replacing the first  <dig> characters of ensangt <dig> with "e". the genes are sorted into different functional groups according to their predicted functions . the mean log2-transformed-fold transcript abundance ratio is shown in column  <dig> 

the down-regulation of several female a. gambiae salivary gland transcripts can be attributed to the depletion of transcripts during protein translation or to the degradation of transcripts following blood-feeding. it is possible that their transcription may have been shut down because these transcripts were no longer required until the next blood-meal. down-regulation of several a. aegypti salivary gland transcripts upon blood-feeding has been shown in a recent publication; the list of transcripts involved coded for secretory proteins, such as odorant binding protein, protease inhibitors, immune genes and other  <cit> .

the secretory protein encoding salivary gland transcripts that displayed a lower abundance after blood-feeding included two obps , two d <dig> long-form precursors , two aminopeptidases, a trypsin  <dig> precursor, a salivary lipase, a 5' nucleotidase precursor, an apyrase, e <dig> protein, cecropin  <dig>  defensin  <dig>  and a hypothetical  <dig>  precursor. in earlier studies, several obp transcripts were shown to be down-regulated after blood-feeding in the head and antennae of a. gambiae  <cit>  and in the salivary gland of a. aegypti  <cit> . in marinotti et al.,  <dig>  transcripts of several serine protease, aminopeptidase, odorant binding protein and transporter genes were found to be down-regulated in whole female mosquitoes  <dig> hrs after blood feeding. the obp and odorant receptors are required by the female mosquitoes to sense host olfactory cues. the fact that the obps are not required after feeding until the next blood-meal may account for their lower transcript abundance. both the secretory proteins aminopeptidases and trypsin  <dig> may be required for the digestion of host proteins or extracellular matrix components  <cit> . the apyrase and 5' nucleotidase proteins are known to facilitate the acquisition of a blood meal by removing pharmacologically active nucleotides that are important for platelet aggregation at the site of the injury  <cit> . the d <dig> proteins inhibit hemostasis, and one short a. stephensi d <dig> protein, hamadarin, has been shown to inhibit the plasma contact system  <cit> . the secretory immune proteins like cecropin and defensin may provide protection against microbes or other pathogens that the mosquitoes encounter during feeding. in  <dig>  rosinski-chupin et al. showed that the immune peptide defensin <dig> and cecropin  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in p. berghei infected a. gambiae salivary glands, thereby demonstrating that the salivary epithelium responds to the presence of pathogens  <cit> .

several transcripts were up-regulated after blood-feeding, and those that encode putative secretory proteins included a trypsin  <dig> precursor, lysozyme, an obp, an atp binding protein, a vitellogenin precursor, and a dnaj precursor. in contrast, two lysozyme transcripts were found to be down-regulated in whole female a. gambiae mosquitoes at  <dig> hours after blood-meal  <cit> . lysozyme has been proposed to prevent bacterial growth in the sugar and blood meals  <cit> . the dnaj family of proteins is involved in protein folding, protein transport, and the cellular response to stress  <cit> . the exact role of these genes in the salivary gland and their function in the blood-feeding process are still not clear. we have further investigated the function of some of these differentially regulated genes by looking at how they influence the mosquito feeding and probing behavior upon depletion.

functional analysis of salivary gland gene implication in blood-feeding and probing behavior
to identify putative components of the a. gambiae salivary gland that play a role in blood-feeding, we performed transient rnai gene-silencing assays on  <dig> salivary gland transcribed genes and studied the effect of this treatment on mosquito feeding behavior on a vertebrate host . in our first assay, instead of assaying probing time of individual mosquitoes we determined the blood feeding capacity  as a measure of their feeding status after  <dig> minutes exposure to the vertebrate host since probing time may not be the only determining factor of feeding capacity, nor an exclusive indicator for a salivary gland function that facilitates feeding. it is conceivable to hypothesize that the amount of ingested blood is dependent on probing time, feeding time and the flow rate of blood which may depend on its viscosity. we specifically compared blood-feeding capacity between gene silenced and control group mosquitoes that had been injected with gfp dsrna according to previously established methodology  <cit> . four of these genes, two d <dig> long forms , one salivary gland peroxidase 5b , and one 5' nucleotidase , were selected because of their predicted anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and anti-platelet activities, respectively  <cit>  as well as their down-regulation after blood-feeding . a salivary gland lipase enzyme  whose function is not clear and down-regulated after blood-feeding  was selected for functional analysis. five other genes were selected based on their predicted involvement in anti-hemostatic processes and for representing major a. gambiae salivary gland secretory proteins: anophelin/cef , which acts as an α-thrombin inhibitor to prevent blood coagulation  <cit> ; a salivary  <dig> kda protein , a member of the aegyptin family, and whose members have been shown to bind to collagen and block platelet adhesion to collagen  <cit> ; an sg <dig> precursor  with unknown function; and salivary mucin  and trio , which are two highly abundant salivary gland transcripts in a. gambiae  <cit>  . in drosophila melanogaster, the trio protein has been shown to be involved in the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for cell migration  <cit> ; however, its exact function in a. gambiae is not known.

rnai-mediated gene silencing assays in adult mosquitoes depend on the direct injection of dsrnas into the hemolymph and we used the dsrna injection procedure established by boisson et al.,  <dig>  and monitored gene silencing efficiency in the salivary glands  <dig> days after dsrna injections . silencing efficiency for the selected genes ranged from 19% to 46% . the effect of gene silencing on the mosquito's blood-feeding capacity is shown in figure 2a, and the statistical analysis of the data is presented in additional file  <dig> 

only mosquitoes in which d7l <dig>  anophelin, peroxidase 5b, or sg <dig> precursor was silenced displayed a significantly altered feeding capacity  when compared to the gfp dsrna-injected control mosquitoes . the d <dig> proteins have been shown to bind biogenic amines such as serotonin and histamine, which may antagonize the vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and pain induction that occur during feeding  <cit> . the lower feeding capacity observed after the silencing of d7l <dig> strongly supports the involvement of its encoded protein  in the blood-feeding process. this protein may act as an anti-hemostatic factor by trapping agonists of hemostasis, as suggested by calvo et al. . the salivary peroxidase 5b is known to have vasodilatory activity. therefore, we hypothesize that the lower blood-feeding capacity of peroxidase-silenced mosquitoes is due to the resulting increased vasoconstriction and diminished blood-flow at the probing site. the anophelin gene encodes an α-thrombin inhibitor that prevents blood coagulation during the blood-feeding process. depletion of the anophelin protein is expected to decrease the blood-flow at the site of probing; an effect that may account for the lower feeding propensity of the anophelin-silenced mosquitoes. silencing of a small secretory peptide sg <dig> precursor also resulted in a decreased blood-feeding capacity, although its role during blood-feeding is not yet clear. in earlier studies, silencing of a salivary apyrase gene  and a sg <dig> precursor led to an increased probing time and decreased blood-feeding ability in a. gambiae mosquitoes  <cit> . however, further studies are needed to characterize the biological properties of this unknown peptide sg <dig> 

the d7l <dig> and 5' nucleotidase genes are known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet activity, respectively; however, the silencing of these two genes resulted in only an 8-10% decrease in their blood-feeding capacity . the lack of any significant effects on feeding after silencing of the remaining six genes  may be related to the relatively low silencing efficiency obtained in the salivary gland as well as to the presence of unknown factors that perform redundant functions in the mosquito salivary gland.

in a second set of assays we determined the effect of salivary gland transcript depletion on the mosquitoes probing time , as a measure of time, or interval, between the insertion of mouthparts into the host skin and the initiation of blood ingestion, according to methodology established in previous studies  <cit> . of the six genes that were selected for probing time assays, depletion of d7l <dig>  anophelin, peroxidase and sg <dig> precursor  resulted in decreased blood feeding capacity and as well as increased probing time . these results strongly suggest a vital role in the blood-feeding process for these genes. depletion of the 5' nucleotidase resulted in a significantly longer probing time  but not a significantly altered blood-feeding capacity . this indicates that blood-feeding capacity is not exclusively dependent on probing time.

the depletion of trio  did not result in any significant changes either in blood-feeding behavior or probing time.

CONCLUSIONS
the mosquito salivary glands play essential roles in blood-feeding and pathogen transmission. we have used a genome-wide microarray approach to characterize the a. gambiae salivary gland transcriptome, which corresponds to  <dig>  genes , thereby extending earlier work based on cdna/est library clones  <cit> . through the use of a full-genome microarray, we have obtained information on salivary gland transcript abundance and assessed the impact of blood feeding on salivary gland gene transcript abundance. the  <dig> transcripts showing significant differential abundance between the salivary glands of unfed and blood-fed female mosquitoes were mainly involved in metabolic, immunity, and oxidative stress-related processes . it will be interesting to know whether the salivary gland expressed immune genes are involved in the interaction with, or killing of, the plasmodium sporozoites. interestingly, the majority of the secretory salivary gland-expressed transcripts displayed a lower abundance after blood-feeding, suggesting that their products may have been employed for protein synthesis during feeding and eventually degraded, or their transcription had been shut down. the lower blood-feeding capacity and increased probing time of mosquitoes upon silencing of the d7l <dig>  anophelin, peroxidase 5b, sg <dig> precursor, and 5' nucleotidase genes is consistent with their role as anti-hemostatic factors   <cit> .

a better understanding of salivary gland gene expression and function can contribute to the development of malaria control strategies based on blocking the plasmodium parasite in genetically modified mosquitoes or transmission blocking vaccines that could inhibit infection of the glands  <cit> . furthermore, our studies indicate that the salivary glands of anopheles mosquitoes express a variety of pharmacologically active substances that may be of value for designing novel anti-thrombotic or anti-platelet drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.
