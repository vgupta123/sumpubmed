BACKGROUND
progesterone induces the meiotic divisions in the amphibian oocyte by activating a signaling system in the plasma membrane . the progesterone receptor on the rana pipiens oocyte surface appears to be localized within the n-terminal external loop of the α1-subunit of na/k-atpase  <cit> . the α-subunits of na/k-atpase are integral plasma membrane proteins with  <dig> transmembrane domains and high interspecies sequence homology  <cit> . based on site-directed mutagenesis data of the rat α1-isoform  and sequence differences between the two ouabain-binding α <dig> isoforms, we predict that at least seven of the  <dig> amino acids in the external m1-m <dig> loop of the low ouabain affinity α1-isoform are involved in progesterone binding  <cit> .

previous studies in our laboratory indicated that one of the earliest responses to progesterone is a transient increase in phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyl transferase   <cit> , an integral plasma membrane protein with  <dig> transmembrane domains. in the current study, we have examined the kinetics and steroid specificity of pe n-methylation in isolated plasma membranes and find that progesterone  binding to the plasma membrane activates pe-nmt within seconds. the initial product of pe-nmt, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine , can, alone, initiate meiosis, suggesting that pme is the primary signaling molecule. the fact that both the progesterone receptor  and pe-nmt are integral membrane enzymes suggests that helix-helix interaction occurs between the m <dig> and/or m <dig> transmembrane helix bordering the proposed progesterone binding site  <cit>  and one or more of the  <dig> transmembrane helixes of the pe-nmt. each of the  <dig> helices of the na/k-atpase is unique, as well as being highly conserved, both in terms of amino acid sequence, and in 3d structure. thus, specific helical structures may be critical for the interaction with helices of adjacent membrane proteins.

computer modeling predicts that only one of the four helices of pe-nmt  is likely to interact with the m1/m <dig> helices in the α1-subunit of na/k-atpase. structure-function studies indicate that progesterone binding causes the m <dig> helix of the α1-subunit to rotate, thus facilitating interaction between hydrophobic regions of m <dig> of the α1-subunit and similar hydrophobic regions of m <dig> of pe-nmt. the rapid increase in pe n-methylation following progesterone addition indicates that both the α1-subunit of the na/k-atpase and pe-nmt are closely associated within the lipid-protein matrix of the oocyte plasma membrane, and are essential components in the steroid rapid response system.

RESULTS
the emphasis in this study is twofold: 1) an analysis of the kinetics and steroid-specificity of progesterone-induced n-methylation of in-situ phosphatidylethanolamine  in isolated, intact oocyte plasma membranes, and 2) the use of computer modeling to predict specific helix-helix interactions between the helices adjacent to the progesterone binding site on the α1-subunit of the na/k-atpase and one or more of the  <dig> helices present in the pe-nmt imbedded in the plasma membrane.

progesterone stimulation of pe-nmt in the intact isolated plasma membrane
sphingomyelin  synthesis also increased  <dig> -  <dig> seconds after the initial rise in pme. sm continued to rise as pme synthesis fell, typical of a precursor-product relationship . this is consistent with our earlier finding that, in oocytes prelabeled with palmitic acid, a fall in plasma membrane ceramide coincided with a transient increase in sm  <cit> , indicating that the end product of pe n-methylation  undergoes a transfer reaction with ceramide to form sm and  <dig> -diacylglycerol .

we find that pme in micellar form is an effective inducer of oocyte meiotic maturation as indicated in figure  <dig>  in contrast, pde has little effect as a meiotic agonist and pc is completely inactive. as also seen in figure  <dig>  an n-methylation inhibitor, 2-methylethane , inhibits progesterone induction of nuclear membrane breakdown but has no effect on induction of meiosis by pme, indicating that pme acts down-stream in the meiotic events initiated by progesterone.

topology and architecture of enzymes  involved in the progesterone-response system
specific interactions between helices are largely driven and stabilized by side chain packing between two or more helices as well as by hydrogen bonding  <cit> . crystallographic data  <cit>  and computer modeling of individual helices in the α-subunit indicates that each helix of the α-subunit is unique, varying from highly ordered  to largely disordered . the more ordered helices should have a higher degree of interaction with similarly ordered helices. we have used four computer modeling approaches to: 1) contrast the topology of each protein, 2) compare the 3d structure of the transmembrane helices in the α1-subunit and the pe-nmt, 3) analyze heptad repeats in each transmembrane helix, and 4) unroll, in effect, each helix to allow comparisons of the amino acid patterns and hydrophobic regions.

the architecture of the α1-na/k-atpase-β γ complex isolated from porcine kidney  is illustrated in figure  <dig> using published x-ray coordinates . helices are represented by ribbons and β-strands by yellow arrows. the conformation shown is based on electron density maps of na/k-atpase crystals prepared in the presence of rb+ after solubilization of the membrane-bound enzyme with a non-ionic detergent, and replacement of much of the lipid with detergent. the plasma membrane region containing the helical transmembrane domains is delineated by red  and blue  dotted lines. the β  and γ  subunits span the plasma membrane at approximately 45°angles. as seen in figure  <dig>  helices  <dig> and  <dig> are connected by an intracellular loop , as are helices  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> . morth et al.  <cit>  pointed out that, in the crystallized form of the enzyme, there is no contact between the helices of the α1-subunit. the only interactions they noted were between the membrane domain of the α1-subunit and the β and γ subunits that are oppositely oriented relative to the membrane plane.

comparison of the 3d projections of all  <dig> helices of the α1-subunit  using chem 3d ultra v.  <dig> , indicates that m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> of the α1-subunit are highly ordered, whereas m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> are largely disordered. m <dig> has an ordered n-terminal sequence with a hinge-like structure at the lumenal end. the computer-derived 3d projections shown in figure  <dig> are consistent with x-ray crystallographic projections derived from purified porcine na/k-atpase  <cit> ; the m <dig> and m <dig> helices are unwound in the middle and m <dig> shows a characteristic kink near the lumenal surface. similarly, m <dig> is unwound at gly <dig>  resulting in a kink.

analysis of possible helix-helix interactions between pe-nmt and na/k-atpase within the membrane bilayer
it is useful to visualize the helices both by chem 3d projections and by computer graphics approaches such as hydrophobic cluster analysis  <cit>  and heptad repeat analysis . figure  <dig> compares the chem 3d projection of the m <dig> helix of the α1-subunit of the na/k-atpase  with the hydrophobic cluster analysis  of the same transmembrane helix. the top and bottom of the helix represent the lumenal and cytoplasmic surfaces, respectively. a stylized lipid bilayer is illustrated to the right of the m <dig> helix. green represents water oxygens, yellow represents phospholipid phosphorus, and red, the fatty acid oxygens associated with the lipid bilayers. the two head group layers, each of which may be 10- <dig> Å thick, enclose a partially disordered layer of lipid hydrocarbon chains, in which virtually no water molecules are present.

the 3d projection of the m <dig> helix  is shown as a classical α-helix . gaboriaud et al.  <cit>  developed an approach that unrolls the helix and makes it possible to visualize the relative positions of both the hydrophobic regions and positions of the shorter side-chains , known to optimize helix-helix packing. the cylinder is shown cut parallel to its axis and unrolled, so that sets of adjacent hydrophobic residues can be encircled. these are termed hydrophobic clusters . as some adjacent amino acids are widely separated by the unfolding of the cylinder, the representation is duplicated, making the peptide sequence easier to follow and giving a graphic representation of the microenvironment of individual amino acids. i , l , f  and y  are considered to be hydrophobic amino acids, whereas a  and c  are mimetic, i.e. hydrophobic only in a hydrophobic environment. since p  lacks a nh group in the peptide backbone and since one of the backbone rotation angles is locked by the proline ring, both the polarity and geometry of the helix are perturbed. pro often, but not always, induces a helix bend. consistent with the method of gaboriaud et al.  <cit> , filled diamonds represent gly, squares with a point  or without , and c for cys. pro is denoted by a red star, but is absent in the m <dig> helix shown. it is apparent that m <dig> of the α1-subunit has a hydrophobic stripe running parallel to the axis of the helix as well as a horizontal hydrophobic stripe corresponding to the hydrocarbon-rich region of the bilayer.

a third method of visualization of transmembrane domains is by analysis of heptad repeats . table  <dig> compares the amino acid sequences of the highly-ordered helices m <dig> and m <dig> in the α1-subunit closest to the progesterone binding site , with the one highly-ordered transmembrane helix  present in pe-nmt. the lumenal surface is at the top, the cytoplasmic surface is at the bottom. hydrophobic amino acid are in bold, hydrophilic amino acids are italicized. these heptads take the form , where the a and d positions are occupied by hydrophobic residues such as i, l, or v . folding a sequence with this repeating pattern into an α-helical secondary structure causes the hydrophobic a and d 'repeats' to form an amphipathic strand . the hydrophobic 'strand' formed by the m <dig> helix is apparent in the hydrophobic cluster analysis projection in figure  <dig> . hydrophobic cluster analysis also demonstrates a second hydrophobic strand encircling the helix at right angles to the lumenal-cytoplasm coil in the m <dig> helix. this horizontal hydrophobic strand corresponds to the central core of hydrocarbon chains in the lipid bilayer  and may thus be involved in helix-lipid interactions.

the helical wheel is an additional useful device for visualizing amphipatic helices  <cit> . figure  <dig> compares helical wheel representations of the amino acid sequences of helices m <dig> and m <dig> of the α1-subunit of na/k-atpase and pe-nmt, respectively. amino acids in yellow are hydrophobic  whereas those in green are polar, uncharged. the amino acid side chains are projected down the axis of each helix and display periodicity with a repeated unit of length of  <dig> amino acids. as noted in table  <dig> above, the heptad repeat comprises residues a through g, where residue a and d are hydrophobic and define a hydrophobic strand, while electrostatic interactions exist between residues at positions e and g. helices m <dig> and m <dig> are rotated such that residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in each wheel are facing each other, and constitute the hydrophobic strands of the corresponding helices. helix m <dig> of the α1-subunit contains a l, v, v, i and f  strand, whereas m <dig> of the n-methyltransferase contains f, l, a, g, l, and l in the opposing hydrophobic strand. although g at position  <dig> of helix m <dig> is indicated as polar, uncharged, it can fit into either hydrophobic or hydrophilic environments, due to its single hydrogen atom side chain.

the most favorable way for two such helices to arrange themselves in an aqueous environment is to wrap the hydrophobic strands against each other, forming a coiled-coil. as shown for pe-nmt m <dig> , the a and d repeats from lumenal surface to cytoplasm are f, l, g, l, l and f, whereas those for m <dig> of the α1-subunit are l, v, v, i, f and y. residues i, l, f and v have the highest hydropathy indices  <cit>  of the common amino acids and account for  <dig> of the  <dig> residues in the m <dig> and m <dig> helices. in contrast, the a and d repeats in the m <dig> helix of the α1-subunit are a, w, s, g, r, and k, with s, r and k being hydrophilic residues . m <dig> of pe-nmt contains only  <dig> hydrophilic residues, both near the cytoplasmic interface, whereas m <dig> of the α1-subunit contains  <dig> polar residues,  <dig> of which are at the cytoplasmic interface. the a,d-pattern in m2/m <dig> predicts that the f-l, l-v, g-v, l-f, and y-f pairs would interact to form a coiled-coil.

discussion
the progesterone response system in the plasma membrane
the isolated plasma membranes used in these experiments are translucent ghosts, free of other cell organelles  <cit> . membrane capacitance measurements indicate that the oocyte plasma membrane surface area is 10- <dig> times greater than the calculated surface area of a corresponding sphere  <cit> . this is consistent with freeze-fracture studies that demonstrate the presence of numerous microvilli at the oocyte surface  <cit> . based on pulse-labeling and pulse-chase studies, phospholipids in the prophase-arrested oocyte plasma membranes turnover rapidly  <cit>  and are recycled to the cell interior with a t1/ <dig> of about  <dig> min  <cit> . this study examines the potential for cross-talk between two integral membrane proteins, the α1-subunit of the na/k-atpase and pe-nmt, in the rapidly recycling lipid bilayer.

our studies indicate that progesterone binding to an external loop of the α1-subunit of the na/k-atpase  <cit>  upregulates an integral membrane protein  to produce a plasma membrane signaling molecule  . we have previously shown that glycerol-labeled pme rises within 1- <dig> min after exposure to progesterone and is derived from the conversion of about 50% of the plasma membrane pe to pme  <cit> . pe reportedly predominates in the inner lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, indicating that pme is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the oocyte cortex  <cit> . a non-metabolizable progestin  is equally effective in stimulating pme formation, whereas a subsequent progesterone metabolite  is largely inactive, indicating that progesterone, and not a progesterone metabolite, is the active ligand .

the lipid-protein microenvironment of plasma membrane
transmembrane helices are embedded in a lipid bilayer that has distinctive regions, characterized by polar lipid head-groups and a central core of hydrocarbon chains . in nondividing eukaryotic cells, phosphatidylcholine , sphingomyelin  and glycosphingolipids are found primarily in the outer  lipid leaflet, whereas the cytoplasmic leaflet is generally enriched not only in phosphatidylethanolamine , but also in phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositides . the inner and outer regions of transmembrane helices of both the α1-subunit and pe-nmt are therefore exposed to different lipid environments. lipid asymmetry is maintained by the slow translayer movement of lipids  <cit>  as well as by selective lipid transporters . transporters include p-type atpases  which transport lipids inwards from the cytoplasmic bilayer and by atp-dependent abc proteins  which catalyze outward transport. the n-methylation of pe in the inner lipid bilayer, triggered by progesterone, is followed by the rapid and successive conversion of the first product of n-methylation  to pde and pc, with further conversion to sm. the newly formed pc and/or sm may in turn be transferred from the inner to the outer lipid bilayer by one or more of the plasma membrane atp-dependent lipid transporters. thus, progesterone-induced pe n-methylation leads to an extensive and rapid rearrangement within the lipid bilayers of the oocyte plasma membrane.

contributions of transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic domains of the α-subunit of the na/k-atpase to cellular regulation
the α1-subunit of the na/k-atpase contains several large intra- and extracellular domains as well as  <dig> transmembrane helices . most structure-function studies of the na/k-atpase in other laboratories have been primarily concerned with ouabain binding sites at the cell surface  and with the role of specific domains within the large intracellular loops of the α1-subunit . studies of α1-subunit interaction with other peptides have been mainly limited to the β and γ subunits . however, xie and askari  <cit>  found that, in addition to pumping ions, the na/k-atpase of cardiac myocytes interacts with neighboring membrane proteins and with the organized cytosolic cascades of signaling proteins  to send messages to intracellular organelles. tian et al.  <cit>  have recently reported that src and na/k-atpase form a functional signaling complex. this peptide-peptide interaction may involve cytosolic domains, however, since gst pulldown assays indicate that the sh <dig> and the kinase domains of src interact with the cd <dig> and cd <dig> cytoplasmic domains of the na/k-atpase α <dig> subunit, respectively. more recently, shinoda et al.  <cit>  have used x-ray crystalographic structure analysis of transmembrane helix-helix interaction between the α, β and γ subunits to explain k+ binding and transport. the progesterone binding studies  <cit>  and the studies outlined here indicate that both helix-helix interactions and cytosolic domains are important in cellular regulation.

determinants of helix-helix interaction in the oocyte plasma membrane
large variations in shape and in tilt angles of the helices relative to the membrane plane are found in both the α1-subunit  and in pe-nmt . other investigators have shown that transmembrane helices may be tilted and packed within the helical bundle and thus only partially exposed to the membrane lipid bilayer . heptad repeats rich in l, i, f, and y predominate in the highly ordered m <dig> and m <dig> helices of the α1-subunit and pe-nmt, respectively . in addition, hydrophobic residues are the most common in the helical region nearest the cell surface, whereas hydrophylic residues are restricted to the region nearest the cytoplasm. these findings indicate that, going from extracellular to intracellular, the helical residues are exposed to successively different microenvironments . examination of helical wheel projections  predicts that helix m <dig> of the α1-subunit and m <dig> of pe-nmt may form a coiled-coil with the a and d positions l, v, v, i, f and y, interacting with the corresponding residues f, l, g, l, l and f, respectively . as described in results, residues i, l, f and v have the highest hydropathy indexes  <cit>  of the common amino acids and account for  <dig> of the  <dig> residues predicted to interact. the higher concentration of hydrophylic residues near the cytoplasmic interface suggests that these residues may interact with the polar ethanolamine head group of the pe molecules, known to predominate in the inner lipid leaflet, and may thus play a role in pe n-methylation.

progesterone-induced changes in helix-helix interactions in the oocyte plasma membrane
it has been proposed that helix-helix interactions stabilize membrane proteins and, that changes in tight packing as well as interactions between specific residues within and between individual helices are important in signal transduction . our previous studies demonstrated that progesterone binds to a plasma membrane site within the external loop between the m <dig> and m <dig> helices of the α1-subunit of the na/k-atpase  <cit> . as noted above, only m <dig> has a highly ordered helix capable of forming a coiled-coil and it is rich in hydrophobic residues l, i, v, f and y. similarly, analysis of pe-nmt indicates that only one of the four transmembrane helices  is both highly ordered and rich in hydrophobic residues .

since the progesterone-induced reactions alter the lipid composition of the oocyte plasma membrane  <cit> , it is important to consider the consequence of differences in the relative lipophobicity of individual amino acids in helix-helix interactions. based on the calculated values for the lipid propensities of individual amino acid resides  <cit> , g, a, s and t are lipophobic, in other words, show the least tendency to interact with lipids within the hydrocarbon region of the plasma membrane. v is lipophobic relative to the head group region of the lipid bilayer and lipophilic relative to the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer. in contrast, l, i and f  are lipophilic and show the strongest preference for interacting with lipid. thus, helices rich in g, a, s, t and/or v would be lipophobic and would preferentially interact with adjacent transmembrane helices having a similar enrichment of g, a, s, t and v. since l and f are also associated with short interchain helix-helix distances  <cit> , apolar residues such as l and f should stabilize helix-helix structures independent of their lipophobicity. an examination of the sequence data in table  <dig> indicates that both m <dig> of the α1-subunit and m <dig> of pe-nmt contain the residues optimal for helix-helix interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
transmembrane helix-helix interactions may have at least two major functions: 1) intramolecular helix-helix interactions would serve to stabilize the tertiary structure of the protein in the membrane bilayer, and 2) helix-helix interactions between two or more integral membrane proteins appear to regulate ligand-initiated response systems. x-ray crystallography of the α1-subunit of na/k-atpase  indicates that  <dig> of the  <dig> helices  lie largely within the core of the α1-subunit, whereas the remaining  <dig> helices ) are on the periphery. computer-generated projections of each helix  indicate that helices within the core are disordered whereas peripheral helices are largely ordered. this suggests that the disordered helices contribute to and/or maintain the tertiary structure of the α1-subunit, whereas the peripheral ordered helices are available for interaction with ordered helices of neighboring integral membrane proteins.

in our model of progesterone binding to the external m1-m <dig> loop  <cit> , the polar β and the hydrophobic α surfaces of the planar progesterone molecule interact with opposite sides of the  <dig> amino acid external loop between m <dig> and m <dig>  peptide flexibility is maximal near the midway point in the m1-m <dig> loop, suggesting that folding could occur within the loop, further stabilizing progesterone binding  <cit> . this would change the relative positions of m <dig> and m <dig> and facilitate helix-helix interaction between m <dig> of the α1-subunit and m <dig> of pe-nmt, resulting in the observed pme formation within the first few seconds . pe is largely localized to the inner bilayer  <cit> , suggesting that the initial n-methylation step occurs in specific regions of the inner  bilayer of the oocyte plasma membrane. one cannot rule out the possibility that an additional peptide intermediate acts to facilitate interaction between helices. for example, the α1-subunit co-isolates with the highly ordered β and γ subunits , and one or both subunits may have an allosteric effect on the progesterone-induced activation of pe-nmt. subsequent biochemical steps involving other integral membrane proteins  are also essential for completion of the meiotic divisions  <cit> . thus, multiple peptides seem to be associated with the steroid response system. the sequential up-regulation of pe-nmt and sm synthase would produce rapid local changes in n-containing plasma membrane phospholipids , and account for the observed  <dig> -dag transient  <cit>  as well as an increase in sm .

since a translayer movement of newly formed phosphatidylcholine  from the inner to the outer bilayer occurs in the plasma membrane  <cit> , sm would also increase in the outer bilayer after exposure to progesterone . these lipid changes would cause the observed progesterone-induced increase in membrane order   <cit>  and result in decreased protein mobility. studies in several laboratories suggest that helix rotation is part of the mechanism for signal transduction involving histidine kinases, adenylyl kinases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins and phosphatases . helix motion could also arise sequentially as a response to progesterone binding to its receptor, the rapid selective turnover of bilayer phospholipids and from the redistribution of newly synthesized phospholipids between the inner and outer bilayers. as shown in figure  <dig>  pme is rapidly converted to phosphatidylcholine , which is, in turn, converted to sm via sm synthase, an integral membrane protein . these three integral enzymes  thus interact sequentially to alter the microenvironment of the plasma membrane and to initiate resumption of the meiotic divisions.
