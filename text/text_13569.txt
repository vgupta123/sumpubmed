BACKGROUND
the genus spirogyra is a member of the zygnemataceae . it comprises unbranched, filamentous green algae that are characterized by spirally coiled chloroplasts and sexual reproduction by means of conjugation. spirogyra is commonly found in stagnant or slowly flowing freshwater habitats all over the world
 <cit> . it is sometimes referred to as an alga of roadside ditches and is frequently used in introductory biology courses
 <cit>  because it often occurs in huge abundances and is easy to address at the generic level. species definition is mainly based on hypnozygote  morphology because the simple morphology in its vegetative state does not permit species recognition. in the latest monograph of spirogyra published by kadlubowska
 <cit> ,  <dig> species are included. they were described using morphological traits, many of them based on a single finding. ashraf and godward
 <cit>  suggested that the mesospore wall structure analyzed using scanning electron microscopy should be added to the species descriptions because the taxonomy of spirogyra at the light microscopical level remains confusing due to overlapping morphological traits
 <cit> . the morphological species concept, which is also applied in spirogyra, is not proven to represent true biological species, nor does it provide any information on the ecological or genetic diversity in a genus. it also does not elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between taxa
 <cit> . accordingly, the diversity of a genus remains unclear when estimates are based a single species concept. the problems arising for spirogyra from findings without ripe hypnozygotes and the low success rate in inducing conjugation
 <cit>  call for other ways of addressing the issue of species delimitation and identification.

the zygnematophyceae  represent the most species-rich lineage in the streptophyta except for the embryophytic land plants
 <cit> . conjugating green algae including the orders desmidiales  and zygnematales  form a unique and distinct group. its taxonomic and phylogenetic separation from other algae is definitive
 <cit> , but relationships within this group have undergone numerous rearrangements and still remain unclear. the classification schemes within the zygnematophyceae have been based on morphological traits such as cell size, wall structure, cellular organization or chloroplast structure
 <cit> , approaches that have been criticized in the past
 <cit> . the zygnematales are distinguished from the desmidiales by a smooth cell wall consisting of a single piece, lacking pores and ornamentations
 <cit> , whereas desmidiales have cell walls consisting of more than one piece with pores and ornaments
 <cit> . filamentous forms are grouped in the family zygnemataceae; the unicellular taxa form the family mesotaeniaceae
 <cit> . this classification, however, is artificial because polyphyly of both families has been proven by phylogenetic analyses
 <cit> .

it remains unclear which growth form is primary and which derived
 <cit> . west
 <cit>  described the ancestral state as filamentous, evolving towards unicellular forms, but yamagishi
 <cit>  stated the opposite. since the introduction of molecular markers, efforts have been made to solve this question
 <cit> , but the position of the genus spirogyra within the zygnematophyceae is not fully resolved. the evolutionary rate is one possible reason for this problem: it differs considerably among zygnemataceaen genera
 <cit> . the uncertain position of spirogyra in phylogenetic analyses is also attributed to the long-branch attraction  phenomenon
 <cit> . some genera of the zygnematophyceae originally defined based on morphology have been revealed as artificial based on molecular markers . furthermore, small subunit nuclear ribosomal dna  phylogenetic studies have often suffered from limited taxon sampling
 <cit> . when genera are represented by just one taxon, authors are unable to address the monophyly of the phylogenetic groups, either at the generic or at higher taxonomic levels. a low number of species within a genus also hinders proving monophyly
 <cit> . in order to assess the monophyly of the genus spirogyra and to investigate whether the low diversity of its vegetative morphology is also reflected in molecular data, we sampled  <dig> strains of different origin. the position within the zygnematophyceae and its long-branch position were evaluated by calculating phylogenetic trees with complex evolutionary models. minimizing the spirogyra lba problem will also help define phylogenetic relationships among genera. additionally, we searched for spirogyra taxa with slower evolutionary rates by including isolates from a broad spatial and ecological range and different vegetative morphology. sampling locations were chosen to cover different types of water bodies in various areas
 <cit> . morphologically different spirogyra filaments were isolated and cultivated for later use to check if the morphological differences are also reflected in phylogenetic groups. we focused on sampling the morphological diversity of the genus. ssu rrna was chosen over ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit gene  because other studies already demonstrated the poor resolution of this marker in the zygnematales and desmidiales
 <cit> .

RESULTS
molecular phylogenetic analyses
the  <dig> spirogyra sequences formed a monophyletic group. this clade, including sirogonium, was subdivided into eight individual sub-clades a to h. molecular phylogenies were inferred from two data sets, one combining zygnematophyceae and spirogyra alignment and one alignment comprising only spirogyra and sirogonium sequences . in the phylogeny inferred from the combined zygnematophyceae alignment , very high bootstrap support was given for branches within the spirogyra clade. only few branches were without support, one indicating a possible polytomy for clade c and another one indicating the lack of support for phylogenetic resolution between clades b and c, and d to h. only very closely related taxa received high support by bootstrap values, e.g., the zygnema clade, sphaerozosma/cosmocladium, gonatozygon/genicularia and closterium/cosmarium. the remaining branches lacked support of at least one method. the individual clades of spirotaenia and spirogyra showed very high bootstrap support from all algorithms. the desmidiales clade was moderately supported : -/50/100/58); the zygnematales clade received no support at all. sirogonium sticticum was placed within the spirogyra clade c. none of the algal families analyzed here formed exclusive clades.
1a: upper right corner: combined zygnematophyceae and spirogyra ssu rrna phylogeny  using  <dig> taxa as outgroup; numbers in brackets indicate number of taxa included in groups.

when using an outgroup , the spirotaenia clade was relocated basal to the rest of the zygnematophyceae; the spirogyra/sirogonium clade formed a sister clade to the remaining zygnematales and desmidiales. the overall length of the branches and the classification of taxa to phylogenetic groups did not change. within the clades, only few rearrangements could be observed in branches that received moderate or poor bootstrap/bayesian support in figure 
 <dig> .when testing tree topologies for the combined zygnematophyceae – spirogyra alignment, the “best tree“ derived from ml analysis  was not the overall best tree . the original ml tree  and the user defined  tree with spirogyra relocated outside in ancestral position to the clades formed by the desmidiales and the zygnematales  had the same likelihood and same bayesian posterior probability values. these two trees were the only ones not rejected by the approximately unbiased test ; the tree representing spirogyra as a sister to a zygnematales clade  was rejected by all tests except shimodaira-hasegawa test  and weighted sh ; spirogyra within the zygnematales clade  was also rejected by all tests except sh. all other trees were significantly worse than the best tree at p ≤  <dig> .

in the spirogyra phylogenetic tree , three sequences could not be placed within any clade: utex  <dig>  utex  <dig> and  <dig> share only a small portion of the identification patterns in base composition with adjacent clades. the major clades received very high bootstrap support, except for clade e that was not supported by ml. the support for branches within clade b was poor due to high sequence similarity. taxa with a secondary loss of the group i ic <dig> intron  were clearly separated from the taxa containing the intron . the placement of sirogonium in any other clade yielded significantly worse trees in all cases . also, the relocation of the sequences previously not included in the clades into an adjoining clade was rejected with only one exception: tree  <dig>  was not rejected by sh test.

sequence similarities in spirogyra
 <dig> spirogyra nuclear encoded ssu rrna sequences of strains from  <dig> different sites were sequenced for this study and, in total,  <dig> different ssu rdna types  were identified. thirty sequence types were found once; the remaining  <dig> were represented by up to  <dig> accessions. thirty-eight clones were found only at a single site and  <dig> more were obtained from up to  <dig> different sampling sites;  <dig> sites were represented by just one accession,  <dig> with up to  <dig> accessions. sixty-seven sampling sites exhibited just one clone and  <dig> had up to  <dig> different clones.

to describe the genetic variability among the discovered eight lineages , the minimal distance and pair-wise differences were calculated in paup. the minimal distance  between two clades was  <dig> % , the maximum  <dig> % , which is  <dig>  times higher than the highest value found in the remaining algal groups included in this study. this means that the within-genus difference in spirogyra exceeds the differences among the remaining genera. the highest within-clade distance was observed in clade h , followed by clade c , whereas the other clades had comparatively low values from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. clade a had the lowest distance value to the zygnemataceae and mesotaeniaceae used in our analyses , while clade h showed the highest distances . the pair-wise differences followed the same pattern  – the biggest difference within spirogyra was recognized between clade a and h  difference); the biggest difference exhibited was clade h to the remaining zygnemataceae .

evolutionary rates in zygnematophyceae
to test the evolutionary rates among the zygnematophyceae, the evolutionary models of different data sets were tested by modeltest. as shown in table 
 <dig>  the data sets revealed major differences in base composition. compared with other zygnematalean taxa, the g/c content of spirogyra is elevated. additionally, high variability of sequences is indicated by a lower portion of constant nt and a different pattern in base substitution rates . ‘zygnemataceae + selected spirogyra’ and ‘spirogyra’ represent the same data sets used for phylogenetic analyses; other data sets were obtained by modifying the previous by exclusion of certain taxa . the biggest difference in g/c content  occurred between the zygnematophyceae data set excluding spirogyra and the spirogyra data set, pointing out the disparity between the two groups . interestingly, the lowest c to t substitution rate was found in the data set used for phylogenetic analyses comprising zygnematophyceae and selected spirogyra ; the highest value was calculated for the zygnematophyceae without spirogyra and spirotaenia . in the spirogyra data set, this value is less elevated  compared to the other substitution rates. evolutionary rates were inferred by pair-wise comparison of unambiguously aligned positions of an rrna ssu alignment of all sequences used in this study in grate . the comparison was calculated among the genera  and among the individual sequences of the alignment . the genus spirogyra showed significant differences to all other zygnematophyceaen genera ; the separate clades also revealed highly different values compared to the other zygnematophyceae . for the remaining genera, the picture was less clear – the evolutionary rates of some taxa such as mesotaeniaceae, desmidiaceae and peniaceae did not differ from each other, but did differ from closteriaceae. analyses of the individual sequences  revealed that the evolutionary rates of all spirogyra sequences differed significantly from all other zygnematophyceaen sequences. the one exception was kra <dig> from clade a: it differed significantly from all spirogyra sequences, but only from two of the zygnematophyceaen sequences; all other differences could not be distinguished statistically. within genera, insignificant values prevailed. the same holds true for spirogyra clades – with one exception: spirogyra clade g showed significant differences among its sequences. most of the disparities among non-spirogyra sequences were not statistically relevant; differences among the spirogyra sequences of clades b to d were mostly not significant, whereas the differences to the clades e to h  were mostly significant.

secondary structure and nhs
to discover the variable positions , hemi-cbcs , and non-homoplasious synapomorphies ) in the ssu rdna of spirogyra, the secondary structures of all strains were compared. no major changes were found in the overall secondary structure of the ssu rdna . variable parts  are predominantly peripheral regions such as e <dig>  e10_ <dig>   <dig>  e23_ <dig>  e23_ <dig>  e23_ <dig>  e23_ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in an alignment of all zygnematophyceae and spirogyra sequences used,  <dig> nhs were identified for the genus spirogyra and/or the individual clades ; for the genus spirogyra,  <dig> nhs were found . eight of the nhs were involved in cbcs: the first base pair  in helix  <dig> , the first c-g pair in helix  <dig> , the fourth bp in helix  <dig>  and the penultimate bp in helix  <dig> . nhs for the individual clades were located in the variable parts of the ssu secondary structure, especially in e10_ <dig>  e23_ <dig>  e23_ <dig>  e23_ <dig>  e23_ <dig> and  <dig> . twenty-nine nhs were found for clade a,  <dig> for b,  <dig> for c ,  <dig> for d,  <dig> for e,  <dig> for f,  <dig> for g and  <dig> for h. nhs were also found for groups of clades :  <dig> nhs for clades b to h,  <dig> nhs for d to h,  <dig> nhs for the group of taxa with the secondary loss of the group i ic <dig> intron ,  <dig> for clades f to h and  <dig> for clades g and h.

discussion
we compared  <dig> ssu rdna sequences of spirogyra and found a high genetic diversity that was unexpected from the phenotypes. our phylogenetic analyses revealed that spirogyra splits into eight independent lineages within zygnematophyceae . in contrast to low phenotypic and high genetic variability in spirogyra, the genus staurastrum – one the most species-rich genera within the desmidiaceae comprising around  <dig> species – showed great variability of morphological characters such as cell shape, size or cell wall ornamentation. in contrast, it yielded no information on phylogenetic relationships or genetic distance, which was interpreted to reflect recent radiation
 <cit> . nonetheless, even a small number of species and their relatively uniform appearance may not guarantee generic monophyly . morphology apparently does not reflect genetic diversity in this group. morphology is even less trustworthy in spirogyra; the genus seems to be very uniform, but the species exhibit a wide overlap of character ranges
 <cit> . furthermore, changes in ploidy level may occur, also affecting morphology
 <cit> .

the overall phylogenetic relationship of the zygnematophyceae included in our analysis confirms other studies separating desmidiaceae, peniaceae and closteriaceae from zygnemataceae and mesotaeniaceae, although the latter two are not resolved from each other
 <cit> . gontcharov et al.
 <cit>  already stated that zygnematales appear to be a polyphyletic assemblage of independent clades. the families mesotaeniaceae and zygnemataceae are not monophyletic, proving that the cell wall traits  are plesiomorphic
 <cit> .

when linking the results of our analysis to rbcl data presented by mccourt
 <cit> , the desmidiales phylogeny is largely congruent, while the mesotaeniaceae and zygnemataceae  show major differences. in mccourt’s analyses, the branch comprising mougeotia/mesotaenium and cylindrocystis/zygnemopsis is placed as an ancestor to other zygnematophyceae; the branch zygnema/zygogonium and spirogyra/sirogonium/spirotaenia emerges at a position basal to the desmidiales. contrarily, in our phylogenetic tree, the zygnematales clade is a sister to the desmidiales clade, although little bootstrap support is given and the genera spirogyra/sirogonium and spirotaenia form individual clades within the zygnematales. those clades form distinct branches basal to the remaining zygnematales branch due to different evolutionary rates of the ssu rdna.

one reason to choose ssu rdna over rbcl for phylogenetic analyses is that, as in the rbcl analyses of mccourt
 <cit> , phylogenetic relationships among the desmidiales show rather poor resolution and do not always receive bootstrap support. furthermore, in the phylogeny in drummond’s analyses
 <cit> , members of the zygnemataceae exhibit very long branches, whereas members of the genera spirogyra and sirogonium have very short branches indicating only little difference in sequence. this could lead to a misplacement of the genus spirogyra, underestimate diversity in this genus and still yield the lba problem
 <cit> .

the order zygnematales pools taxa with differing evolutionary rates. on one hand, it is important to include these taxa into phylogenetic analyses to obtain an overview of major relationships. on the other hand, taxa with accelerated evolutionary rates often disturb the analyses. this might be the major reason for low bootstrap support in some of the clades we analyzed. in general, the genetic diversity in the zygnematales at the generic level has been underestimated in favor of morphological traits that proved to be uninformative at the phylogenetic level
 <cit> . some genera defined solely by morphological characters are probably artificial and polyphyletic
 <cit> . thus, the species concept in this group needs urgent revision, and the generic concept requires scrutiny. spirogyra is positioned ancestral to the remaining zygnematales  in our phylogenetic tree. by testing the udt against the best tree derived from ml analysis, we conclude that spirogyra has to be placed outside of the zygnematales clade; this position is definitely not caused by lba, because no other position in the phylogenetic tree was accepted by udt testing. such a position is also supported by analyses of combined zygnemataceae and spirogyra  <dig> group i intron alignments
 <cit> .similar to the rbcl results of mccourt
 <cit> , our data do not support the hypothesis of monophyly for groups exhibiting a similar cell shape. in accordance to mccourt’s findings, but in contrast to previous ssu rdna analyses
 <cit> , chloroplast shape seems to be a diagnostic trait: stellate and laminate chloroplast containing taxa form two sister clades
 <cit> , yet without clear indication of the ancestral chloroplast type
 <cit> .

mccourt
 <cit>  stated that derived cell and chloroplast forms of placoderm desmids are better photosynthesizers and have achieved greater evolutionary success. this is difficult to reconcile with the ecological success of some of the so-called “primitive forms” such as spirogyra, which is among the most widespread and species-rich conjugating green algae
 <cit> . high evolutionary rates seem to be more common in “primitive forms” such as spirogyra, zygnema and mougeotia, whose evolutionary rates reportedly differ from other zygnematales
 <cit> . combined, we conclude that the lack of so-called derived cell and chloroplast forms is compensated for by a high evolutionary rate. this yields a large variety of genotypes and helps cover ecological niches more quickly.

c-u ratios are generally elevated compared to the remaining substitution rates . this is because mutations from c to u or u to c in non-coding rna are not detrimental, as the change in base pairs from g-u or g-c does not affect secondary structure. the biggest difference within the gtr + i + g model occurs between spirogyra and the remaining zygnematophyceae without spirotaenia: spirogyra shows a  <dig>  units lower rate, which partly explains the different mutation rate compared to other algae. both spirogyra and spirotaenia show a slightly elevated a-g substitution rate . spirogyra displays not only a higher evolutionary rate, but also a different pattern of base substitution rates compared to the remaining zygnematales. evolutionary rates within spirogyra are more diverse than previously expected; significant differences among clades and sequences outside the same clade prevail. finally, clades b to d, comprising sequences with the  <dig> group i intron, form a group with fewer differences compared to clades e to h, comprising taxa without the intron.

the genus spirogyra is clearly monophyletic. no sequences were found that had slower evolutionary rates or that could resolve the long branch reported in previous studies
 <cit> . the individual spirogyra clades found in both of our data sets are essentially the same and well supported by bootstrap and pp values. moreover, the phylogenetic relationship among those taxa exhibiting the secondary loss of the  <dig> group i intron is identical. the spirogyra clade branches are longer than the branches of most genera of desmidiales. two long branches within the genus spirogyra are present in both trees; one separates clade a from the rest, and the other separates taxa with the secondary loss of the  <dig> group i intron. spirogyra taxa characterized by the absence of the  <dig> group i zygnematalean intron form a distinct clade with no exception in both trees. this clearly indicates a single loss event. this explanation is supported by the accelerated evolutionary rate of the exon region of the ssu rdna
 <cit> . a large number of differentiating nhs exists both within the genus spirogyra  and for each clade. this emphasizes the distinctness and genetic variety within the genus. in contrast, gontcharov and melkonian
 <cit>  found only very few nhs to circumscribe the different clades in cosmarium.

earlier hypotheses suggested the unicellular spirotaenia as the ancestor of the filamentous spirogyra <cit> . although spirotaenia shares many attributes of the genus spirogyra such as chloroplast shape, absence of the  <dig> group i intron
 <cit>  and an elevated evolutionary rate, molecular analyses have not proven or clarified its phylogenetic position. our analyses revealed two well-supported branches at the base of the zygnematalean clade, but the ancestral form remains unclear. spirotaenia’s unusual position among the zygnematales was already investigated by gontcharov and melkonian
 <cit> . their results indicate no affiliation of the two genera
 <cit> . they therefore suggested excluding spirotaenia from the zygnematophyceae sensu stricto. perhaps the same applies to the genus spirogyra, but this remains to be proven by further genetic analyses. sequence differences of the unambiguously aligned positions within spirogyra reached  <dig> nt difference among the strains , whereas the biggest difference found within the remaining taxa was  <dig> nt . also, the average, median and mode of the difference between sequences are higher in spirogyra than in the remaining taxa considered. within the clade, the range of pair-wise differences within the examined desmidiales  ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> nt: this group includes  <dig> families and  <dig> genera. the relative distances within this group do not exceed  <dig> . within the genus spirogyra,  <dig> individual distances between clades exhibit bigger values . the same trend was observed in the remaining zygnematales  – the range of pair-wise differences resulted in  <dig> to  <dig> nt, the respective distance values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the genetic differences within the genus spirogyra, i.e. among the individual clades, exceed the differences of genera in either of the other groups. this calls for discussion and further investigation on whether spirogyra still should be considered a single genus or rather be subdivided based on the clades we differentiated. this once again underlines the different evolutionary rates and reflects the great genetic variability of the genus spirogyra.

drummond et al.
 <cit>  found spirogyra to be monophyletic, but still treated sirogonium as a separate genus based on rbcl data. they were unable to discover morphological characters useful for a generic distinction, simply because the taxa are largely congruent . the diagnostic characters are mainly based on the mode of conjugation: while spirogyra develops conjugation tubes, sirogonium filaments are bent towards each other and form knee-shaped bends, so-called geniculations. drummond et al.
 <cit>  also considered the shape and ornamentation of the chloroplast margin as a diagnostic feature, but our observations showed this character to be variable and highly dependent on filament vitality. other morphological characters such as chloroplast number or cell width are also known to be highly variable and could be explained by polyploidy
 <cit> . other authors also found spirogyra and sirogonium forming a single lineage based on single gene analyses  and combined data sets
 <cit> . gontcharov stated in  <dig> that the genus sirogonium has to be rejected and s. sticticum  has to be considered as a species within spirogyra <cit> . interestingly, czurda
 <cit>  already suggested including sirogonium into spirogyra as one of four subgenera. we also found spirogyra to be monophyletic and inseparable from sirogonium. monophyly of the spirogyra/sirogonium clade was determined in all our phylogenetic analyses, placing sirogonium firmly in clade c. all alternative tree topologies relocating sirogonium outside spirogyra were significantly worse than the best tree uniting spirogyra and sirogonium. sirogonium shares nhs signatures with the genus spirogyra and the clade in which it is located.

CONCLUSIONS
spirogyra is monophyletic, incorporating the former genus sirogonium. genetic diversity and genetic distances within spirogyra exceed the diversity and distances found in other zygnematophyceaen genera. our results suggest pursuing the question whether spirogyra should be split into several genera, one of them incorporating sirogonium.

in the surveyed  <dig> sequences,  <dig> individually different clones were identified – more than was expected from the simple vegetative morphology. the genus forms eight well-supported clades that differ considerably in nhs pattern – ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nhs for a clade. the genus spirogyra itself exhibits  <dig> nhs . characterizing those clades will require additional studies considering phylogenetic studies on its <dig> secondary structure, hypnozygote morphology, vegetative characteristics and ecology.
