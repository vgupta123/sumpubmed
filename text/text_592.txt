BACKGROUND
phenylobacterium zucineum strain hlk1t is a facultative intracellular microbe recently identified by us  <cit> . it is a rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium  <dig> – <dig>  ×  <dig> – <dig> μm in size. it belongs to the genus phenylobacterium  <cit> , which presently comprises  <dig> species, p. lituiforme   <cit> , p. falsum   <cit> , p. immobile   <cit> , p. koreense   <cit> , and p. zucineum   <cit> . they were isolated from subsurface aquifer, alkaline groundwater, soil, activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, and the human leukemia cell line k <dig>  respectively. except for p. zucineum, they are environmental bacteria, and there is no evidence that these microbes are associated with eukaryotic cells. the hlk1t strain, therefore, represents the only species so far in the genus phenylobacterium that can infect and survive in human cells. since most, if not all, of the known microbes that can invade human cells are pathogenic, we proposed that hlk1t may have pathogenic relevance to humans  <cit> . unlike the known intracellular pathogens that undergo a cycle involving invasion, overgrowth, and disruption of the host cells, and repeating the cycle by invading new cells, hlk1t is able to establish a stable parasitic association with its host, i.e., the strain does not overgrow intracellularly to kill the host, and the host cells carry them to their progeny. one cell line  infected with p. zucineum has been stably maintained for nearly three years in our lab .

in this report, we present the complete genome sequence of p. zucineum.

RESULTS
genome anatomy
the genome is composed of a circular chromosome  and a circular plasmid  . the g + c contents of chromosome and plasmid are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. there are  <dig>  putative protein-coding genes , of which  <dig>  have significant matches in the non-redundant protein database. of the matches,  <dig> are conserved hypothetical proteins and  <dig>  are proteins with known or predicted functions. forty-two trna genes and one 16s-23s-5s rrna operon were identified in the chromosome.

there are  <dig> families of protein-coding repetitive sequences and a family of noncoding repeats in the genome . notably, identical copies of repeats 02– <dig> were found in both the chromosome and the plasmid, suggesting their potential involvement in homologous recombination.

5two partial copies are located in the chromosome, of which a "partial" copy with full length is inserted by a copy of repeat <dig> 

6repeats 01– <dig> are is elements

on the basis of cog  classification, the chromosome is enriched in genes for basic metabolism, such as categories e  and i , accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total genes in the chromosome, respectively. on the other hand, the plasmid is enriched for genes in categories o  and t , constituting  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total genes in the plasmid, respectively.

as to genes in the plasmid that cope with environmental stimuli, about half of the genes in category o are molecular chaperones , including  <dig> dnaj-like molecular chaperones,  <dig> clusters of dnak and its co-chaperonin grpe , a cluster of groel and its co-chaperonin groes , and  <dig> heat shock proteins hsp <dig>  of  <dig> genes in category t, there is one cluster , which is essential for the growth of c. crescentus under hypoxic conditions  <cit> .

general metabolism
the enzyme sets of glycolysis and the entner-doudoroff pathway are complete in the genome. all genes comprising the pentose phosphate pathway except gluconate kinase were identified, consistent with our previous experimental result that the strain cannot utilize gluconate  <cit> . the genome lacks two enzymes , making the oxidative and reductive branches of the tricarboxylic acid cycle operate separately. the genome has all the genes for the synthesis of fatty acids,  <dig> amino acids, and corresponding trnas. although full sets of genes for the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine were identified, enzymes for the salvage pathways of purine  and pyrimidine  were absent. the plasmid encodes some metabolic enzymes, such as those participating in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the citric acid cycle. however, it is worth noting that the plasmid has a gene  that is the only copy in the genome .

like most other species in the genus phenylobacterium, the strain is able to use l-phenylalanine as a sole carbon source under aerobic conditions  <cit> . a recent study revealed that phenylalanine can be completely degraded through the homogentisate pathway in pseudomonas putida u  <cit> . p. zucineum may use the same strategy to utilize phenylalanine, because all the enzymes for the conversion of phenylalanine through intermediate homogentisate to the final products fumarate and acetoacetate are present in the chromosome .

functional elements responding to environmental transition
hlk1t is able to survive intracellularly and extracellularly. consistently, the genome contains the fundamental elements to support the life cycle in different environments. the genome contains abundant two-component signal transduction proteins, transcriptional regulators, and heat shock response proteins, enabling the strain to respond to extra- and intra-cellular stimuli at transcriptional and post-translational levels. among the total of  <dig> two-component signal transduction proteins , there are  <dig> histidine kinases,  <dig> response regulators, and  <dig> hybrid proteins fused with histidine kinase and response regulator. sixteen pairs of histidine kinase and response regulator  are adjacently aligned and may act as functional operons. these tightly linked modules make two-component signal transduction systems respond to environmental changes efficiently. the genome encodes  <dig> transcriptional regulators  . notably, we annotated the proteins of  <dig> bacteria  with the same annotation criteria used for p. zucineum and found that the fraction of two-component signal transduction proteins and transcriptional regulators was positively correlated with the capacity for environmental adaptation . the genome contains  <dig> extracytoplasmic function  sigma factors  . ecfs are suggested to play a role in environmental adaptation for pseudomonas putida kt <dig>  whose genome contains  <dig> ecfs  <cit> . p. zucineum has  <dig> heat shock sigma factors rpoh  and  <dig> heat shock molecular chaperons  , which can cope with a variety of stresses, including cellular energy depletion, extreme concentrations of heavy metals, and various toxic substances.  <cit> .

2cog <dig>  predicted rna polymerase sigma factor containing a tpr repeat domain

1rpoh may be responsible for the expression of some or all heat shock proteins

2the function of molecular chaperones is to protect unfolded proteins induced by stress factors through renaturation or degradation in cooperation with protease.

the genes for cell motility include  <dig> chemotaxis operons,  <dig> mcp  genes,  <dig> other genes related to chemotaxis , and  <dig> genes for the biogenesis of the flagellum .

the genome contains sec-dependent, sec-independent, typical type ii  and iv secretion systems , which are known to play important roles in adapting to diverse conditions  <cit> .

1the habitats of s. meliloti, b. suis, and r. conorii were indicated in a recent publication  <cit> .

2according to our recent publication  <cit> , p. zucineum was classified as "facultative". 3given that g. oxydans is often isolated from sugary niches  and associated soil   <cit> , we classified g. oxydans as "multiple".

to better understand the roles of proteins responsible for environmental transition, we computed the distributions of those proteins in  <dig> representative alphaproteobacteria with typical habitats . like other multiple bacteria and facultative bacteria, which can survive in multiple niches, p. zucineum encodes a higher fraction of ecfs, transcriptional regulators and two-component signal transduction proteins than obligate bacteria . notably, p. zucineum has the largest number of heat shock related proteins , in comparison to the  <dig> representative alphaproteobacteria and  <dig> bacteria . among the plasmid-encoded heat shock related proteins are  <dig> rpoh  and  <dig> dnak-grpe clusters . further phylogenetic analysis suggested that the plasmid-encoded dnak-grpe clusters may have undergone a genus-specific gene duplication event .

the genes involved in defense against oxidative stress include superoxide dismutase , catalase , peroxiredoxin , hydroperoxide reductase , and the glutathione redox cycle system .

since intracellular free fe is not sufficient to support the life of bacteria, to survive intracellularly, they must use protein-bound iron, such as heme and transferrin, via transporters and/or the siderophore system. the p. zucineum genome has one abc type siderophore transporter system , one abc type heme transporter system , and  <dig> tonb-dependent receptors which may uptake the iron-siderophore complex .

comparative genomics between p. zucineum and c. crescentus
comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that p. zucineum is phylogenetically the closest to c. crescentus  <cit>  , consistent with the phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rna gene sequences .

though the genome size and protein number of p. zucineum  are similar to those of c. crescentus , no large-scale synteny was found between the genomes. the largest synteny region is only about  <dig> kb that encodes  <dig> proteins. the conservation region with the largest number of proteins is the operon encoding  <dig> ribosomal proteins. in addition, the species share only  <dig> %  of orthologous proteins. categories j , f , and l  are the top  <dig> conservative cog categories between the species, sharing  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the orthologs, respectively.

comparison of cell cycle genes between p. zucineum and c. crescentus
since p. zucineum is phylogenetically closest to c. crescentus, and since the latter is a model organism for studies of the prokaryotic cell cycle  <cit> , we compared the genes regulating the cell cycle between these species.

the cell cycle of c. crescentus is controlled to a large extent by the master regulator ctra, which controls the transcription of  <dig> genes involved in the cycle  <cit> . on the other hand, ctra is regulated at the levels of transcription, phosphorylation, and proteolytic degradation by its target genes, e.g., dna methyltransferase  regulates the transcription of ctra, histidine kinases  regulate its activity, and clpxp degrades it. these regulatory 'loops' enable ctra to precisely control the progression of the cell cycle.

p. zucineum has most of the orthologs mentioned above . among the  <dig> ctra-regulated genes in c. crescentus,  <dig> have orthologs in the p. zucineum genome . the fraction of ctra-regulated genes with orthologs in p. zucineum  is significantly greater than the mean level of the whole genome , indicating that the ctra regulatory system is highly conserved. genes participating in regulating central events of the cell cycle, such as ccrm , clp protease  and  <dig> regulatory proteins, except for one response regulator , are present in the p. zucineum genome. the genes without counterparts in p. zucineum are mostly for functionally unknown proteins.

notably, the sequence of ctra is strikingly similar between p. zucineum and c. crescentus, with  <dig> % identity of amino acid sequence and  <dig> % identity of nucleotide sequence. in addition, they share identical promoters   <cit>  and the motif  recognized by dna methyltransferase    <cit> , suggesting that they probably share a similar regulatory loop of ctra.

consistent with the results from in silico sequence analysis, the ctra of p. zucineum can restore the growth of temperature-sensitive strain lc <dig>  of c. crescentus  <cit>  at 37°c, indicating that the ctra of p. zucineum can functionally compliment that of c. crescentus in our experimental conditions .

taken together, the comparative genomics of p. zucineum and c. crescentus suggests that the cell cycle of the former is likely to be regulated similarly to that of the latter.

presence of ests of the strain in human
since p. zucineum strain hlk1t can invade and persistently live in several human cell lines  <cit> , we were curious about whether this microbe can infect humans. by blasting against the human est database  with the whole genome sequence of p. zucineum, we found  <dig> matched ests , of which  <dig> were from a library constructed from tissue adjacent to a breast cancer, and  <dig> were from a library constructed from a cell line of lymphatic origin. the preliminary data suggest that p. zucineum may invade humans.

1all of three sequences come from the library bn <dig> containing  <dig> ests; the original dataset was produced by a modification of the est sequencing strategy orestes  <cit> 

2all six sequences come from the library nih_mgc_ <dig> containing  <dig>  ests; the original dataset was produced and released by the "mammalian gene collection" project  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work presents the first complete bacterial genome in the genus phenylobacterium. genome analysis reveals the fundamental basis for this strain to invade and persistently survive in human cells. p. zucineum is phylogenetically closest to c. crescentus based on comparative genome analysis.
