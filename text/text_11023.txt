BACKGROUND
epithelial to mesenchymal transition  is an extreme form of cellular plasticity defined by loss of epithelial cell morphology, dissociation of cell-cell contacts, reduction in proteins mediating cell-cell contacts, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, de novo expression of α-smooth muscle actin , and acquisition of mesenchymal cell shape  <cit> . during emt, cells diminish epithelial gene expression and acquire mesenchymal gene expression  <cit> . cortical actins, the actin filament bundles below the plasma membrane, reorganize or are lost, while stress fibers comprising f-actin are gained. in normal development, emt has been associated with processes in gastrulation, heart formation, palate formation, and mullerian tract regression  <cit> . in disease states, emt has been exploited in both cancer and organ fibrosis. the mortality in human cancers is caused by primary tumor cells that have undergone oncogenic emt and metastasized to other organs. other diseases, such as end-state organ failure by fibrosis, are caused by repeated and sustained infliction of emt. thus, understanding the cellular mechanisms to reverse emt is of great importance.

the tgf-β signaling pathway is considered a good target for emt reversal because it is a key mediator of fibrosis and facilitator of metastasis  <cit> . tgf-β induces emt by both smad-dependent and -independent signaling events  <cit> . tgf-β <dig> ligand exerts its signaling effects by activating a heteromeric receptor of two transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, type i and type ii receptors   <cit> . tβrii transphosphorylates tβri, activating its kinase function. activated tβri then phosphorylates the intracellular proteins smad <dig> and smad <dig>  the phosphorylated smad <dig> and smad <dig> associate with smad <dig>  with the activated complex translocating to the nucleus where it interacts with other transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors to regulate expression of numerous genes  <cit> . this smad-dependent signaling up-regulates expression of several transcription factors important for emt induction, including snail, slug, twist, and members of the zfh family, zeb <dig>  and zeb <dig>   <cit> .

of particular importance are zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> because they are crucial regulators of emt during embryonic development and cancer  <cit> . these transcription factors activate emt by binding to e-box elements present in the e-cadherin promoter, suppressing synthesis of this cell-cell adhesion protein  <cit> . zeb <dig> also promotes emt by repressing expression of basement membrane components and cell polarity proteins  <cit> . zeb <dig> has also been implicated in the induction of emt  <cit> . the loss of e-cadherin and other epithelial structural components is a major event during emt. mutations in the tcf <dig> gene  result in a mesenchymal to epithelial transition  in mouse embryos by reprogramming gene expression, leading to developmental defects by diminishing progenitor cell proliferation and cell migration  <cit> . thus, it is crucial to understand the role of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> in the reversal of tgf-β-induced emt.

multiple signaling proteins in addition to smads have been implicated in the induction of emt by tgf-β <dig>  these include ras/mapk  <cit> , integrin β- <dig> <cit> , integrin-linked kinase  <cit> , p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase   <cit> , rhoa kinase   <cit> , phosphatidylinositol 3-oh kinase   <cit> , jagged1/notch  <cit> , sara  <cit> , nuclear factor kappa-b   <cit> , par <dig>  <cit> , and erk  <cit> . however, much less is known about how these signaling pathways and transcription factors maintain the mesenchymal program. studies examining the reversal of emt by perturbing one component of a signaling pathway with inhibitors or shrnas demonstrate partial reversal of the mesenchymal state  <cit> .

here, we report full reversal of emt morphology and patterns of gene expression by concurrently inhibiting tβri kinase and rock. we show that inhibition of tβri kinase blocks mesenchymal gene expression, an effect mediated by down-regulation of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> levels, while the rock inhibitor stabilizes the epithelial structure. these findings demonstrate that combined use of tβri kinase and rock inhibitors is important to decrease tgf-β signaling to enable full reversal of emt.

RESULTS
tgf-β <dig> induces emt in mtec-ko cells
we used primary mouse tubular epithelial cells isolated from the renal cortex of tgf-β <dig> knockout mice  to model emt in culture  <cit> . the mtec-ko cells exhibit greater epithelial features than do wild-type renal epithelial cells. renal tubular epithelial cells were chosen because of the correlation between the extent of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the prognosis for end-stage renal disease  <cit> . in the absence of tgf-β <dig>  mtec-ko cells form an epithelial sheet; incubation with  <dig> pm tgf-β <dig> for  <dig> hours induced the mtec-ko cells to acquire a more fibroblast-like, spindle shaped morphology indicative of mesenchymal cells . incubation with the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> blocked the tgf-β1-induced transition of the mtec-ko epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. the morphological transformation correlated with major changes in the actin cytoskeleton as revealed by phalloidin staining. untreated epithelial cells exhibited a cortical actin staining below the cell membranes, whereas the tgf-β1-treated cells displayed elongated f-actin stress fibers. in the cells treated with the tβri inhibitor sb <dig>  short, non-cortical actin fibers were detected.

the structural integrity and polarization of epithelial cells is maintained by e-cadherins binding to catenins and a network of actin filaments; reduction of e-cadherin expression is a hallmark of mesenchymal acquisition  <cit> . thus, we also examined the expression levels of several genes regulated by tgf-β <dig> as markers for the epithelial and mesenchymal states. in mtec-ko cells, incubation with tgf-β <dig> led to a significant decrease in expression of the epithelial protein e-cadherin and increase in expression of the mesenchymal protein α-smooth muscle actin  by  <dig> hours .

because tgf-β <dig> is known to regulate expression of multiple cadherins, we also examined expression of kidney-specific cadherin . ksp-cadherin has a similar developmental pattern of expression as the tight junction proteins zo- <dig> and claudin- <dig> in kidney epithelial cells; therefore, it is used as a marker of the epithelial state  <cit> . incubation with tgf-β <dig> led to a significant reduction in the level of ksp-cadherin rna , while it led to significant increases in the rna levels of mesenchymal markers matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>   and smooth muscle protein  <dig>   . mmp- <dig> is an important extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme; sm <dig> has been shown to drive smooth muscle-specific gene expression in vivo  <cit> . thus, we conclude that mtec-ko cells completed the emt program by several criterions following incubation with tgf-β <dig> 

a combination of tβri inhibitor with either rock or p <dig> mapk inhibitors is required for complete emt reversal
to examine the reversibility of emt induced by tgf-β <dig> in mtec-ko cells, we looked at the effects of five different kinase inhibitors targeting tβri, p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase , map kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activator kinase , c-jun nh-terminal kinase , and rho kinase  with sb <dig>  sb <dig>  u <dig>  sp <dig>  and y <dig>  respectively. these kinase inhibitors were previously implicated in emt  <cit> , 42- <dig> and their specificities have been well studied  <cit> . the cells were first incubated with  <dig> pm tgf-β <dig> for  <dig> hours to induce emt, the kinase inhibitors were then added, and incubation was continued for an additional  <dig> hours. addition of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> at  <dig> μm for  <dig> hours was sufficient to reduce significantly the rna level of the tgf-β-responsive gene plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>   <cit> , demonstrating that tgf-β <dig> signaling was effectively inhibited .

to assess the effects of the kinase inhibitors on emt, the actin cytoskeleton was examined by phalloidin staining. in contrast to its ability to prevent induction of emt by tgf-β <dig>  and to reverse the elevation of pai- <dig> expression , the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> failed to reverse the mesenchymal actin stress fiber morphology of the tgf-β1-treated mtec-ko cells . inhibition of other kinases previously implicated in inducing emt, such as p <dig> mapk, mek <dig>  jnk, and rock, also did not reverse the actin stress fiber morphology induced in the mtec-ko cells by tgf-β <dig> . these results indicate that individual kinase inhibitors cannot fully reverse tgf-β1-induced emt in mtec-ko cells.

since emt effects are mediated by multiple cellular pathways, we also tested pair wise combinations of inhibitors of tβri , p <dig> mapk , rock , mek <dig> , and jnk  . we chose to use low doses of the inhibitors to reduce the chance of non-specific small molecule binding  <cit> . when the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> was combined with either p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> or rock inhibitor y <dig> for  <dig> hours, the epithelial appearance was restored . the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> plus p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig>  reduced the presence of stress fibers more than either treatment by itself. however, non-cortical actin filaments were still detectable. detectable actin stress fibers were eliminated by the combination of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> and rock inhibitor y <dig> . cortical actin bordering the cell-cell junctions was restored by both combinations. the addition of either mek <dig> inhibitor u <dig> or jnk inhibitor sp <dig> along with tβri inhibitor sb <dig> had no detectable effect on the mesenchymal phenotype of the cells . the combination of p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> and rock inhibitor y <dig> restored cortical actin staining, but stress fiber actin remained in the cells . increasing the concentration of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> to  <dig> μm led to a further decrease in the level of stress fibers; however, the combination of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> with a p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> or rock inhibitor y <dig> was more effective at eliminating them . similar results were observed in wild-type mtec cells, with a combination of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> and rock inhibitor y <dig> reversing emt as indicated by both gene expression  and cell morphology . collectively, these data indicate that treatment of the cells with tβri inhibitor sb <dig> by itself cannot lead to full re-acquisition of cortical actin at the cell junctions.

the effects of individual or combinations of kinase inhibitors on the expression of several genes altered by emt were also examined by quantitative rt-pcr. the mtec-ko cells were treated with  <dig> pm tgf-β <dig> to transition into the mesenchymal state; afterward, the kinase inhibitors were added. incubation with tgf-β <dig> significantly reduced the ksp-cadherin rna level within  <dig> hours . addition of either tβri inhibitor sb <dig> or rock inhibitor y <dig> to the mesenchymal cells did not restore ksp-cadherin rna to pre-tgf-β1-levels . incubation with p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> led to a further decrease in ksp-cadherin expression. the combination of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> plus p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> was not effective in increasing the ksp-cadherin rna level, but addition of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> together with rock inhibitor y <dig> led to a much greater increase in the ksp-cadherin rna level than the level achieved with either inhibitor by itself . tβri inhibitor sb <dig> efficiently reduced sm <dig> and mmp- <dig> expression to pre-emt levels . the p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> did not reduce either the sm <dig> or mmp- <dig> expression level, indicating that presence of this p <dig> mapk inhibitor failed to reverse expression of these genes associated with the mesenchymal state. the rock inhibitor y <dig> partially reduced sm <dig> expression , but increased mmp- <dig> expression . this increase in mmp- <dig> expression was prevented by treatment with tβri inhibitor sb <dig> combined with rock inhibitor y <dig> . thus, we conclude that the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> by itself is sufficient to induce the accumulation of some transcripts specific to epithelial cells; however, the combination of tβri and rock inhibitors can effectively induce the accumulation of certain additional epithelial-specific transcripts such as ksp-cadherin that correlate with the full reversal of emt.

one important criterion for epithelium restoration is re-expression of the cell-cell junction adhesion protein e-cadherin. to test for this factor, we incubated mtec-ko cells with  <dig> pm tgf-β <dig> for  <dig> hours to induce emt, added the indicated kinase inhibitors, and continued incubation for an additional  <dig> -  <dig> hours . addition of the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> , rock inhibitor y <dig> , or p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig>  by itself led to partial reformation of e-cadherin at cell junctions compared to the tgf-β1-treated-mtec-kos . addition of the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> together with either p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig>  or rock inhibitor y <dig>  restored e-cadherin localization to a level indistinguishable from that observed in the non-tgf-β1-treated cells . jnk inhibitor sp <dig> alone  or a combination of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> plus jnk inhibitor sp <dig>  did not restore either the level or localization of e-cadherin. the combination of tβri inhibitor sb <dig> plus rock inhibitor y <dig> was most effective in restoring both localization of e-cadherin and its protein level as determined by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates . thus, we conclude that the tβri, p <dig> mapk, and rock inhibitors increase e-cadherin levels; however, the combination of the tβri inhibitor with p <dig> mapk or rock inhibitor is most effective.

reduction in zeb <dig> levels is necessary for emt reversal by tβri inhibitor
in the next series of experiments, we decided to examine the effects of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> levels because their expression is regulated by tgf-β  <cit>   and they are highly expressed in fetal kidney cells  <cit> . zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> can also play an important role in emt induction by repressing e-cadherin expression  <cit> . our data presented above led us to hypothesize that decreasing expression of transcriptional emt regulators such as zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> is not sufficient for complete emt reversal; rather, the presence of a rock inhibitor is also necessary to decrease mesenchymal structural components such as stress fibers. historically, the effects of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> have been studied in non-proximal tubule kidney cell lines such as maderin darby canine kidney  cells  <cit> . we chose here to use namru murine mammary gland  cells, a traditional emt cell culture model  <cit> , because:  nmumg cells are easier to manipulate than mtec-ko cells;  they contain a readily detectable level of zeb <dig> protein ;  we could only assay expression of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> in mtec-ko cells by quantitative rt-pcr , not immunoblotting ; and  rna levels do not necessarily well reflect the protein levels of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig>  since zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> are highly regulated post-transcriptionally  <cit> .

nmumg cells were incubated with  <dig> pm tgf-β <dig> for  <dig> hours to induce emt, the indicated kinase inhibitors were added, and incubation was continued for an additional  <dig> hours . treatment of nmumg cells with tgf-β <dig> led to a small increase in the level of zeb <dig> protein . following incubation with tβri inhibitor sb <dig>  the level of zeb <dig> protein decreased back down to the level of untreated nmumg cells . incubation with rock inhibitor y <dig> by itself led to a significant increase in the level of zeb <dig> ; however, if cells treated with the rock inhibitor y <dig> were also incubated with tβri inhibitor sb <dig> , the level of zeb <dig> decreased to the level of untreated cells. zeb <dig> protein was difficult to detect with our antibody; nevertheless, we could readily detect zeb <dig> protein in the cells incubated with tβri inhibitor sb <dig> plus jnk inhibitor sp <dig> , indicating this combination of inhibitors led to increased expression of zeb <dig> even if not zeb <dig>  from these results, we conclude that incubation with tβri inhibitor can reverse the increase in zeb <dig> levels.

we next tested whether the decrease in zeb <dig> level by kinase inhibitors restored e-cadherin expression in nmumg cells treated with tgf-β. similar to our findings in the mtec-ko model system, incubation with tgf-β <dig> led to loss of e-cadherin . incubation with either the tβri inhibitor sb <dig>  or the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> in combination with rock inhibitor y <dig>  restored the e-cadherin level. rock inhibitor y <dig> alone was not effective in restoring the e-cadherin level . e-cadherin was also not restored in cells incubated with tβri inhibitor sb <dig> plus jnk inhibitor sp <dig> . although the zeb <dig> level was similar to the cells incubated with the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> and rock inhibitor y <dig> , the cells incubated with tβri inhibitor sb <dig> plus jnk inhibitor sp <dig> also expressed zeb <dig>  which could account for the observed repression of e-cadherin expression. these data indicate that inhibition of the tgf-β-induced increase in zeb <dig> levels can lead to re-expression of e-cadherin. however, the re-expression of e-cadherin can be inhibited if zeb <dig> is expressed.

to test whether zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> levels directly affect e-cadherin expression, we performed rna-mediated interference experiments. nmumg cells infected with lentiviruses expressing a pool of individual zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> shrnas knocked down endogenous expression of zeb <dig> to a nearly undetectable level within  <dig> hours regardless of whether the cells had been treated with tgf-β <dig> . although zeb <dig> protein was not detected by our assay in these cells, we included shrnas targeting zeb <dig> because others reported detection of zeb <dig> rna in tgf-β <dig> treated nmumg cells  <cit> . while incubation with tgf-β <dig> led to loss of e-cadherin , this treatment with zeb <dig> plus zeb <dig> shrnas restored e-cadherin to levels that were higher as compared to the original cells . zeb depletion together with incubation with  <dig> μm y <dig> also led to increased e-cadherin expression . thus, we conclude that depletion of zeb by either shrnas or kinase inhibitors is sufficient to re-introduce e-cadherin expression in tgf-β-induced mesenchymal cells.

zeb <dig> depletion combined with rock inhibitor y <dig> is required to complete the emt reversal program by eliminating stress fibers
loss of e-cadherin is accompanied by rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton to maintain polarized cell structure. nmumg cells treated with tgf-β exhibit stress fibers and lower cell number . thus, we also examined the effect of zeb level on the arrangement of f-actin stress fibers in nmumg cells. treatment of the cells with shrnas against zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> led to attenuation of the stress fibers ; however, the arrangement of f-actin did not completely reverse as compared to the cells incubated with the kinase inhibitors . on the other hand, nmumg cells treated with tgf-β and incubated with rock inhibitor y <dig> together with the zeb shrnas exhibited decreased f-actin fibers and reappearance of cortical actin . this failed to occur when tgf-β-treated cells infected with the viruses expressing the shrnas against the zebs were incubated with jnk inhibitor sp <dig> . taken together, these data indicate that rock inhibitor y <dig> treatment leads to stabilization of cortical actin, while reduction in expression of the zebs leads to increased expression of factors such as e-cadherin necessary for emt reversal.

discussion
the goal of this study was to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining the mesenchymal state induced by tgf-β <dig>  here, we demonstrated that preventing emt requires blocking the tβri kinase , while reversing the emt program is more complex, requiring inhibition of both tβri kinase and rock . a p <dig> mapk inhibitor also plays a role by working in conjunction with the tβri kinase inhibitor to further lessen the mesenchymal structural elements to reverse emt . we defined the success of an agent in reversing emt as the re-expression of key epithelial proteins  and the re-positioning of these proteins to allow for epithelial cell morphology. we also demonstrated that reversal of emt by the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> involves, in part, inhibiting expression of zeb <dig>  a key transcriptional repressor of e-cadherin expression and the epithelial state . taken together, these findings indicate that tgf-β maintains the mesenchymal phenotype through sustained activation of smad-dependent transcriptional responses and elements downstream from rock .

decreasing zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> expression enables partial re-programming of emt by inducing e-cadherin expression
the levels of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> can regulate the epithelial transition to the mesenchymal state,  <cit> . in madin-darby canine kidney  cells, emt is preceded by the loss of mature mir200a-c, inducing up-regulation of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> expression followed by loss of e-cadherin expression and transition to the mesenchymal state  <cit> . in cancers or fibrosis, this feedback loop may be disrupted, leading to unregulated expression of zeb <dig> or zeb <dig>  to regain this feedback loop, a small molecule inhibitor of tβri may be useful to block factors maintaining the mesenchymal state. in this case, blocking the feedback loop during tgf-β1-induced maintenance of zeb <dig> levels might enable re-expression of mirna <dig> family members and proteins involved in epithelial cell morphology .

thuault et al.  <cit>  previously examined the role of snail, another e-box-binding transcriptional repressor of e-cadherin gene expression, in emt reversal. they reported that high mobility group a <dig>  sustains tgf-β-induced emt in nmumg cells, with partial emt reversal occurring as measured by restoration of tight junction proteins and a partial restoration of cortical actin when snail is targeted for depletion by shrna. however, e-cadherin did not re-colocalize or become expressed at cell-cell junctions, indicating that either snail was not sufficiently knocked down in their experiment or there was another factor regulating localization of the cytoskeleton components.

our studies demonstrate that depleting mesenchymal cells of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> with specific shrnas or using a trβi inhibitor in combination with a rock inhibitor is sufficient to restore fully e-cadherin protein levels . however, solely targeting zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> with shrnas did not lead to full restoration of cortical actin at the cell borders; rather, treatment as well with a rock inhibitor was necessary for complete reduction of stress fibers . other factors may also be necessary to maintain the epithelial cytoskeleton.

rock regulates the cytoskeleton during emt reversal to stabilize the epithelial structure
one plausible regulator of the actin cytoskeleton is rho. here, we showed that rock is responsible for only a subset of emt changes, such as actin rearrangement . inhibiting rock was not sufficient to induce e-cadherin or other epithelial characteristics . this finding implies that rock is necessary for epithelial cells to regain cytoskeletal structure. we hypothesize that re-acquisition of the epithelial cytoskeleton might sequester the mesenchymal signaling associated with the unformed cell-cell adhesions  <cit> . in mammary gland epithelial cells, rho location is controlled by the partitioning-defective protein 6c , a regulator of the polarity complex  <cit> . when tβrii is activated, par <dig> is phosphorylated and recruits the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase smurf <dig> to the cell membrane, thereby regulating the localization of rho by ubiquitination. this implies that the location of rho is important for the arrangement of actin in epithelial cells. to determine the mechanism of tgf-β activation of stress fibers, further studies are needed to examine if tgf-β induces f-actin stress fibers as the result of rock activating lim kinase and cofilin  <cit>  or by rock regulating gene expression through jak-stat and nf-b pathways  <cit> .

temporal control of emt reversal varies with the agents and cell type
other reports of mesenchymal phenotypic reversion utilizing inhibitors have claimed various degrees of success. for example, emt induced in eph <dig> mouse mammary epithelial cells by an estradiol-inducible c-fos-estrogen receptor fusion protein was only partially reversed after  <dig> -  <dig> days of incubation with bibu  <dig>  a small molecule inhibitor of tβri kinase  <cit> . however, ectopic expression of e-cadherin combined with addition of bibu  <dig> did lead to full reversal of the eph <dig> mesenchymal cells as assayed by the formation of cobblestone-like epithelial sheets with tight junctions between the cells and localized expression of e-cadherin and β-catenin at cell junctions, but only after  <dig> days. others have reported that incubation with individual inhibitors of tβri kinase is sufficient to increase e-cadherin expression and to induce a more epithelial morphological appearance within  <dig> hours in several cell lines  <cit> . by contrast, our study showed that a combination of a tβri inhibitor and a rock inhibitor can enable complete, rapid reversal of emt within  <dig> hours, including re-expression of ksp-cadherin and e-cadherin . plausible explanations for the differences in our observations include  the agents employed to induce emt, and  the specific cell types used in the experiments.

chemical inhibition of jnk blocks emt reversal by the tβri inhibitor
our studies demonstrate that small molecule inhibition of jnk can block the reversal effects of the tβri inhibitor by maintaining stress fibers and decreasing e-cadherin levels . suppression of jnk leads to increased expression of the transcription factor slug in trophoblast stem cells, leading to induction of an emt state  <cit> . like zeb <dig> and zeb <dig>  slug induces emt by repressing expression of e-cadherin via binding to e-box elements in the e-cadherin promoter  <cit> . another plausible explanation for maintenance of non-tgf-β-dependent emt is that the jnk inhibitor may activate other pathways such as nf-b  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated nf-b both suppresses apoptosis and induces emt in breast cancer cells  <cit> . nf-b has been shown to induce emt by upregulating e-cadherin transcriptional repressors such as snail, slug, zeb <dig>  and zeb <dig>  <cit> . this indicates that a jnk inhibitor should not be used in conjunction with a tβri inhibitor as doing so may compromise emt reversal.

inhibitors in combination may be a feasible therapeutic approach for treating patients with emt-associated diseases
in chronic fibrotic diseases, reversal of the mesenchymal state generated by emt may be critical for restoring function to organs. for example, it might provide a potential therapy for treating chronic kidney damage caused by constitutively high levels of tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . blocking emt is useful for preventative medicine. however, reversing emt holds more promise for treating existing diseases. our use of small molecule inhibitors of individual protein kinases not only demonstrates their potential for dissecting mechanisms of signal transduction for specific ligands and for delineating their roles in biologic responses, but also their potential as therapeutic agents. yingling et al. have described a group of competitive atp-binding site inhibitors of alk- <dig> as possible agents for treating some cancers and fibrosis  <cit> . in certain cancers, treatment with a tβri inhibitor shows promise in halting metastasis  <cit> . therapeutics in the form of growth factors such as bmp- <dig> can also act as tgf-β antagonists to treat fibrotic disease  <cit> . other approaches to block tgf-β activity, such as anti-sense dna targeting tgf-β, are in clinical trials as a vaccine against tumor cells or as therapeutics for treating patients with high-grade gliomas  <cit> . in addition, rock and p <dig> mapk inhibitors are in clinical trials as potential therapeutics targeting a variety of cancers  <cit> . these recent developments suggest multiple therapeutic strategies may be possible for treating patients with diseases in which tgf-β-induced emt contributes to the pathology.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed here that reversing emt in mtec-ko cells requires inhibition of both tβri kinase and rock. the tβri kinase inhibitor decreased expression of zeb <dig> and zeb <dig>  thereby increasing expression of the epithelial protein e-cadherin, and the rock inhibitor was necessary to fully eliminate mesenchymal actin stress fibers .
