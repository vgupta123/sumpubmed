BACKGROUND
in recent years, there has been increased interest in using genetically engineered plants as an alternative expression system for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins  <cit> . plant systems offer advantages over conventional expression platforms in a number of areas, including low production cost, easy and quick scale-up, low risk of product contamination by mammalian viruses or blood-borne pathogens, and an overall higher quality of products. to date, nuclear transformed plants have been shown to be able to produce numerous recombinant proteins of therapeutic value, including human diagnostic and therapeutic full-length and single-chain antibodies, antigens, cytokines and autoantigens. moreover, crop plants can be used for the production and delivery of safe and effective edible vaccines against various infectious and immune-related diseases  envelop surface protein in transgenic tobacco plants was reported as  <dig> % of total soluble protein   <cit> , whereas the accumulation level of cholera toxin b subunit , a vaccine antigen against cholera, in nuclear transgenic tobacco was between  <dig>  to  <dig> % of tsp  <cit> . therefore, new strategies need to be developed to overcome limited recombinant protein accumulation before the potential of transgenic plants for therapeutic protein production can be fully realized.

an alternative strategy for improving foreign protein production yield is through chloroplast transformation of higher plants or closely related eukaryotic green algae. evidence suggests that use of transgenic chloroplasts as bioreactors offers significant advantages over nuclear transformed plants. these include high-level protein accumulation due to increased foreign gene content in chloroplasts , expression of multiple genes through a single transformation event, increased transgene containment because of maternal plastid inheritance, as well as a lack of position effects on foreign genes  <cit> . additionally, the endogenous presence of chloroplast chaperones and enzymes aids in complex multi-subunit protein assembly and can correctly fold proteins containing disulfide bonds, thereby drastically reducing the costs of in vitro processing. high levels of foreign proteins have been obtained via expression through the chloroplast genome. for example, the expression level of ctb in chloroplast transgenic plants reached up to  <dig> % of tsp  <cit> , while its expression level in nuclear transgenic plants accounted for  <dig>  to  <dig> % of tsp  <cit> . similarly, while the expression level of human serum albumin, an important therapeutic protein with many applications, in nuclear transgenic plants was around  <dig> % of tsp  <cit> , expression levels of up to  <dig> % of tsp were observed in chloroplast transgenic plants  <cit> . there are many other vaccine antigens or biopharmaceutical proteins that have been produced in chloroplast transgenic plants. they include, for example, bacillus anthracis protective antigen  against anthrax  <cit> , fragment c of tetanus toxin  for tetanus  <cit> , the outer surface protein a  of borrelia burgdorferi against lyme disease  <cit>  and cytokines such as interferonα2b  and ifn-γ  <cit>  as well as a diabetes-associated autoantigen human proinsulin  <cit> . furthermore, many of them have been shown to be fully functional in animal studies. the reader is referred to the recent reviews by daniell and colleagues for further information  <cit> .

compared to chloroplast transgenic plants, the use of chloroplast transgenic algae as a bioreactor offers several additional advantages. microalgae, such as c. reinhardtii, grow and reproduce faster than any other terrestrial or aquatic plant, doubling its biomass in approximately  <dig> hour, and microalgae are non-toxic and non-polluting, thus environmentally friendly for mass cultivation and commercial exploitation. also, there will be a significant reduction in the time required to generate transgenic algae as compared to higher plants. in general, stable transplastomic lines can be obtained in as little as  <dig> weeks, with the potential to scale up to mass production in an additional 4– <dig> weeks  <cit> . all of these have made microalgal chloroplasts to be another valuable platform for the molecular farming of pharmaceutical proteins. indeed, the c. reinhardtii chloroplast expression of a large single-chain antibody has shown accumulation levels of  <dig>  to 1% of algal tsp  <cit> . recently, manuell et al.  <cit>  demonstrated robust expression of a bioactive mammalian peptide, bovine mammary-associated serum amyloid , in c. reinhardtii chloroplasts with levels up to 5% of tsp. there are several other antigenic proteins that have been produced using this system, including foot-and-mouth disease virus vp <dig> protein  <cit> , tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand   <cit>  and the protein e <dig> of classical swine fever virus  <cit> . the reader is referred to recent reviews on this area for further information  <cit> .

glutamic acid decarboxylase- <dig>  catalyzes the formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid  from glutamine. it is one of the major autoantigens in type  <dig>  diabetes, an autoimmune disease resulting from the destruction of insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that many new-onset type  <dig> diabetic patients have autoantibodies against gad <dig>  with the presence of anti-gad <dig> antibodies now serving as an important marker for the prediction and diagnosis of type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . the identification of gad as a major autoantigen in type  <dig> diabetes may also present unique opportunities for the development of novel preventative therapies against the disease. indeed, immunization of young non-obese diabetic  mice, an animal model for human type  <dig> diabetes, with gad <dig> or gad peptides prevents or delays the onset of diabetes  <cit> . furthermore, the suppression of gad in nod mouse islets was shown to protect the mice from developing diabetes  <cit> . all of these results suggest the potential importance of gad <dig> in diagnosing and treating type  <dig> diabetes in humans. however, recombinant production of hgad <dig> using conventional bacterial or mammalian cell culture-based expression systems is limited by high cost, low efficiency and low yield. to overcome these limitations, we have recently explored transgenic plants as an alternative expression platform for the production of hgad <dig>  <cit> . although transgenic plants offer several production advantages, including the possibility of allowing direct oral delivery of plant-derived gad <dig> to induce oral immune tolerance, plant expression of hgad <dig> is still limited by low accumulation levels .

the goal of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of using c. reinhardtii chloroplasts as a novel expression platform for the production of hgad <dig>  to this end, a chloroplast transformation vector containing the full-length hgad <dig> gene, under the control of the c. reinhardtii chloroplast rbcl promoter as well as rbcl 5'- and 3'-utrs, was generated and introduced into the chloroplast genome of c. reinhardtii. here, we show that chloroplast transformed c. reinhardtii cells express and accumulate recombinant hgad <dig> at levels of  <dig> – <dig>  % of algal tsp. immunological analysis shows algal-derived recombinant hgad <dig> reacts with type  <dig> diabetic sera from nod mice, and stimulates the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes from nod mice. these results demonstrate that agal-derived gad <dig> contains its authentic antigenicity, further suggesting the potential use for microalgae as a novel production system for human therapeutic proteins.

methods
strains, growth media and culture conditions
c. reinhardtii wild-type strain 137c was used as a host for chloroplast transformation. cells of the strain 137c were maintained on tris acetate phosphate  agar or grown in liquid tap medium at 23°c under constant illumination of ~ <dig> μe/m2·sec- <dig>  when grown in tap liquid medium, algal cells were cultured in flasks rotating at  <dig> rpm.

construction of the chloroplast expression vector pxw-gad-his
to construct chloroplast expression vector pxw-gad65- <dig> × his, hgad <dig> cdna was amplified by pcr from plasmid vector ptrl-gad <dig>  <cit>  using the primer pairs: 5'- ttccatggcatctccgggctctggc-3'  and 5'-ataatctagattaatgatgatgatgatgatgtaaatcttgtccaaggcg ttc-3' . the forward primer contains an engineered ncoi site , whereas the reverse primer contains an xbai site  immediately downstream of sequence encoding the  <dig> × his-tag  and stop codon . pcr was performed on a perkin-elmer model  <dig> thermocycler under the following conditions: initial denaturation for  <dig> min at 94°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 50°c for  <dig> s, and extension at 72°c for  <dig> s, followed by a final extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr product was isolated and blunt-end ligated into the smai site of puc <dig>  after verification by sequence analysis, the hgad <dig> gene was released by digestion with ncoi and xbai, blunt-ended with klenow fragment, and cloned into chlamydomonas chloroplast transformation vector puc7- <dig>  composed of the rbcl gene promoter and its 5' untranslated region  and 3' utr. the resulting hgad <dig> expression cassette was then isolated as a single bamhi fragment and ligated into the c. reinhardtii chloroplast transformation vector p <dig>  containing the  <dig>  kb ecori/xhoi restriction fragment from the c. reinhardtii inverted repeat region , forming plasmid pxw-gad-his.

chloroplast tranformation
c. reinhardtii wild type strain 137c was grown in tap liquid medium to late log phase , with subsequent cell harvesting by centrifugation . the cell pellet was resuspended in tap to a density of approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml. of this cell suspension,  <dig> μl was spotted onto the central area  of a tap agar plate and incubated in the dark at room temperature for  <dig> hours. after incubation, plates were bombarded with  <dig> μg of pxw-gad-his dna mixed with equal amounts of plasmid p <dig> dna and coated onto tungsten particles for delivery using a biolistic pds-1000/he particle delivery system  as described by boynton et al.  <cit> . plasmid p <dig>  containing the 16s rrna gene conferring spectinomycin resistance, was used to screen and/or identify transformed algal cells. bombarded cells were incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature, re-plated onto tap agar plates containing spectinomycin  and incubated under dim light. colonies appearing after 2– <dig> weeks were re-streaked onto tap agar plates containing spectinomycin and grown for approximately one more week. colony cells were subcultured into tap liquid medium containing  <dig> μg/ml spectinomycin and grown for one day under shaking conditions. cells were then diluted and plated onto tap agar plates containing spectinomycin to obtain single colonies. several rounds of replating on selective medium were required to obtain homoplasmic cell lines.

dna isolation and pcr analysis
total dna was isolated from wild-type c. reinhardtii and transformants using the method described by newman et al.  <cit>  with minor modifications. briefly, cells were grown in liquid tap medium, harvested by centrifugation  and resuspended in ten buffer . the cell suspension was centrifuged, and the pellet resuspended in  <dig> μl h2o on ice and to it,  <dig> μl of sds-eb buffer  was added. the suspension was extracted once with  <dig> μl of phenol/cia  and the aqueous phase was collected and added with  <dig> μl of cia. after a final centrifugation, the aqueous phase was collected, mixed with two volumes of 100% ethanol and incubated on ice for  <dig> minutes. the solution was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes to pellet the dna. the dna was then subjected to pcr analysis. to confirm the presence of the hgad <dig> gene, pcr was performed using the following pair of hgad <dig> specific primers: forward 5'- aagaattctggcatctccgggctctg-3' , and reverse 5'- aattctcgagttataaatcttgtccaaggcg-3' . pcr reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min, annealing at 50°c for  <dig> s, and extension at 72°c for  <dig> s, followed by a final extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. to determine the specific integration site of gad <dig> in the chloroplast genome, long range pcr was performed using the long pcr enzyme mix  with primer sets cp <dig>  gad- <dig> and cp <dig>  gad- <dig>  the primer cp <dig>  represents a location at one end of the inverted region of the chloroplast genome in c. reinhardtii, whereas the primer cp <dig>  represents a location at the other end of this inverted region . pcr reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s each at 94°c,  <dig> s at 59°c and  <dig> min at 68°c followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s each at 94°c,  <dig> s at 59°c and  <dig> min and  <dig> s at 68°c. to identify homoplasmic cell lines, pcr was performed with chloroplast specific primers cp <dig> and cp <dig> using the following reaction conditions: initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s each at 94°c,  <dig> s at 57°c and  <dig> min at 68°c, and followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s each at 94°c,  <dig> s at 57°c and  <dig> min and  <dig> s at 68°c. pcr products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

rna isolation and rt-pcr analysis
total rna was extracted from wild-type c. reinhardtii and transformants using the trizol rna extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. rna was reverse transcribed to cdna by superscript ii reverse transcriptase  according to the manufacturer's protocol. briefly,  <dig> μg of total rna,  <dig> μl oligo12– <dig> ,  <dig> μl dntp mix  and  <dig> μl sterile distilled water were mixed and incubated at 65°c for  <dig> min. following addition of  <dig> μl first-strand buffer and  <dig> μl  <dig>  m dtt, the reaction mixture was further incubated for  <dig> min at 42°c. after incubation,  <dig> μl of superscript™ ii reverse transcriptase was added and incubated at 42°c for  <dig> min. the resulting cdna was used as template for pcr, using hgad <dig> specific primers. pcr reactions contained  <dig> μl of cdna,  <dig>  mm dntps,  <dig> μm of each primer, 1× reaction buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  and  <dig>  u of taq polymerase in a total volume of  <dig> μl. these reactions were incubated at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> min, 50°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig> min with a final extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr products were ran on a  <dig> % agarose gel and compared against a dna ladder .

western blot analysis
total crude protein was extracted from transformants and wild-type c. reinhardtii using the method as described by goldschmidt-clermont  <cit> . for immunoblot analysis, protein extract was boiled, separated on a 15% sds polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto pvdf  membrane . membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk-tbst, washed with tbst, and then incubated for  <dig> h with a 1: <dig> dilution of a rabbit anti-gad65/ <dig> primary antibody  followed by incubation with 1: <dig> diluted horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. immunodetection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence  detection system  according to the manufacturer's instructions. quantification of the expression level of hgad <dig> in algal cells was performed by a sandwich elisa. in brief, a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with mouse anti-gad <dig>  antibody at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/well, and incubated at 4°c overnight. the wells were washed three times with pbst , and blocked with 3% bsa in pbs for  <dig> hours at room temperature. after washing three times with pbst,  <dig> μg of extracted total algal protein was added per well, and plates incubated overnight at 4°c. after washing with pbst,  <dig>  μg of rabbit anti-gad <dig>  was added per well and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> hours. after washing,  <dig> μl of 1: <dig> diluted hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit igg antibody  was added per well and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hour. after incubation,  <dig> μl/well of tmb substrate  was added and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> minutes for color development. the color reaction was stopped by addition of  <dig> μl/well stop solution . the plate was read in a microplate reader  at  <dig> nm. the hgad <dig> concentration in samples was determined by comparison to a standard curve created with purified hgad <dig> standard .

purification of algal-derived hgad <dig> protein
algal-derived recombinant hgad <dig> was purified by histidine affinity chromatography using hitrap chelating hp columns  according to the manufacturer's instructions. in brief, a total of  <dig> ml of c. reinhardtii cells were homogenized in  <dig> ml extraction buffer . the homogenate was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the supernatant was filtered through a  <dig>  μm membrane filter, and loaded onto a hitrap chelating hp column and washed with wash buffer  to remove nonspecifically bound endogenous algal proteins. the bound algal-derived hgad <dig> was eluted with elution buffer . fractions were collected and analysed by sds-page and elisa. the hgad <dig> fraction was then dialyzed extensively against pbs to remove high salt and imidazolel, and concentrated using a speed vacuum.

determination of immunoreactivity of algal-derived hgad <dig> with diabetic sera by elisa
the antigenicity of algal-derived hgad <dig> was determined by its immunoreactivity with diabetic sera from nod mice using elisa. in brief, purified algal-derived recombinant hgad <dig> was added to a 96-well microtiter plate in a volume of  <dig> μl/well  and incubated overnight at 4°c. after incubation, the plate was washed, blocked with 3% bsa in pbs solution, and incubated overnight at 4°c with diabetic and control serum samples . diabetic serum samples were obtained from newly-onset diabetic nod mice, whereas control serum samples were collected from balb/c mice. after washing,  <dig> μl of 1: <dig> diluted hrp-conjugated anti-mouse igg antibody was added per well and the plate incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hours. the color development was performed as described above for sandwich elisa.

spleen cell proliferation assay
for the spleen cell proliferation assay, spleen cell suspensions were prepared from 8-week-old nod mice. in brief, individual spleens were pressed through a sterile falcon cell strainer , and lysed with ammonium chloride potassium  lysis buffer  to remove erythrocytes. the resulting cell suspension was washed with dpbs , and resuspended in complete rpmi  <dig> media at a viable cell concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> ml- <dig>  spleen cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well flat-bottom microtitre plates , with insect cell-derived hgad <dig> standard , algal-derived hgad <dig> or the unrelated protein antigen ovalbumin   added. the cell cultures were incubated at 37°c in a 5% co2-humidified incubator for  <dig> hours and pulsed with  <dig> μci/well tritiated thymidine. after a  <dig> hour post growth, cells were harvested, and the tritiated thymidine incorporated was determined by using a beckman ls  <dig> liquid scintillation counter . results were shown as the mean counts per minute  of triplicate spleen-cell cultures.

RESULTS
construction of a chloroplast expression vector and algal transformation
the plasmid pxw-gad-his  was constructed and used for c. reinhardtii chloroplast transformation. the expression of hgad <dig> was under the control of the c. reinhardtii chloroplast rbcl promoter and 5' utr and 3' utr. a c-terminal  <dig> × his tag was added to facilitate purification of the recombinant protein using metal-affinity chromatography. the chimeric gene was flanked by sequence from an inverted repeat region of the c. reinhardtii chloroplast genome to provide sites for in vivo homologous recombination. the plasmid pxw-gad-his was transformed into wild-type c. reinhardtii chloroplasts by particle bombardment along with the plasmid p <dig> conferring spectinomycin resistance as a means of selection.

pcr analysis of c. reinhardtii transformants
c. reinhardtii transformants were selected on tap agar plates supplemented with spectinomycin . primary putative transformants were initially screened by pcr for the presence of the hgad <dig> gene using gad specific primers. as shown in figure 2a, pcr amplification of the genomic dna obtained from primary transformants resulted in the synthesis of a product with expected  <dig>  kb size. no pcr products were produced from dna isolated from wild-type c. reinhardtii. positive transformants were administered additional rounds of selection in order to obtain homoplasmic cell lines in which all copies of the chloroplast genome contained the introduced chimeric hgad <dig> gene. to demonstrate that the hgad <dig> expression cassette was site-specifically integrated into the algal chloroplast genome, long pcr amplification of genomic dna from selected transformants was performed using a combination of primer sets. as indicated in figure  <dig>  primers cp <dig> and cp <dig> were designed to be complementary to sequences lying just outside the inverted repeat region of the c. reinhardtii chloroplast, and therefore pcr amplification of genomic dna from transformants with a cp <dig> and cp <dig> primer pair would give an expected  <dig>  kb dna product if the hgad <dig> cassette was correctly inserted into the inverted region of the algal chloroplast genome. as shown in figure 2b, a dna fragment of expected size was produced after pcr amplification. in contrast, pcr amplification of genomic dna from wild-type c. reinhardtii using the same cp3/cp <dig> primer pair produced a band of smaller molecular weight , equivalent in size to the inverted repeat region of the algal chloroplast dna lacking inserted foreign dna. the apparent lack of amplification of any  <dig>  kb product from the inverted repeat region of chloroplast dna with transformants further implies that transformants are all homoplasmic. additional long pcr was performed using a combination of gad and chloroplast specific primers to show foreign dna inserted to the chloroplast inverted region was indeed that of hgad <dig>  the primer gad- <dig> was designed according to the n-terminal coding sequence of hgad <dig>  when cp <dig> and gad- <dig> were used as a primer pair, a 4-kb pcr product spanning the full hgad <dig> coding sequence , 3' rbcl utr  and the xhoi-bamhi fragment  of the flanking inverted repeat region would be expected. as shown in figure 2c, a 4-kb dna fragment was obtained with the use of this primer pair. similarly, when gad- <dig>  and cp <dig> were used as a primer pair, an expected  <dig> -kb pcr product , chloroplast rbcl promoter and 5' utr  and a  <dig> -kb bamhi-ecori fragment of the flanking inverted repeat region) was amplified from the same transformant . as expected, no pcr products were generated from c. reinhardtii wild-type strain 137c dna when the same cp <dig> and gad- <dig> or cp <dig> and gad- <dig> primer pair was used . taken together, these results suggest all transformants analysed were homoplasmic for the hgad <dig> cassette site-specifically inserted into the host chloroplast genome.

transcriptional analysis of hgad <dig> in c. reinhardtii transformants by rt-pcr
the transcriptional expression of hgad <dig> in c. reinhardtii transformants was evaluated by rt-pcr from total rna isolated from wild-type c. reinhardtii and transformants. when hgad <dig> specific primers were used, a product of expected size  was detected in cdna reverse-transcribed from rna isolated from selected transformants . no rt-pcr products were detected in cdna from wild-type c. reinhardtii. to rule out possible amplification of contaminant dna in the samples, direct pcr amplification without reverse transcription was performed on the rna preparations. no amplified pcr products were seen under the same conditions, confirming the specificity of the rt-pcr reaction . in summary, these data indicate that hgad <dig> is actively transcribed in chloroplast transformed algal cells.

accumulation of hgad <dig> protein in c. reinhardtii transformants
to demonstrate the accumulation of hgad <dig> protein, total soluble protein  was prepared from wild-type c. reinhardtii and transformants, and analyzed by western blotting.

anti-human gad <dig> polyclonal antibody detected a single 65-kda band, corresponding in size to the hgad <dig> protein . no protein band was detected in extracts from c. reinhardtii wild-type strain 137c. accumulation levels of hgad <dig> in algal cells were measured using elisa. as shown in figure  <dig>  algal derived hgad <dig> accounts for up to  <dig>  to  <dig> % of tsp.

immunoreactivity of algal-derived hgad <dig> with sera from diabetic nod mice
since prediabetic patients with type  <dig> diabetes and nod mice contain anti-gad antibodies in their sera  <cit> , the antigenicity of algal-derived hgad <dig> was determined by its immunoreactivity with diabetic sera. thus, purified algal-derived hgad <dig> was coated onto a microtiter plate and tested against three diabetic serum samples collected from nod mice. three serum samples obtained from balb/c mice were used as non-diabetic controls. as shown in figure  <dig>  all three diabetic serum samples had higher binding capacity to algal-derived hgad <dig> than did reference serum samples, with samples number  <dig> and  <dig> showing a significant difference . these results suggest that algal-derived recombinant hgad <dig> is antigenic.

effect of algal-derived hgad <dig> on spleen cell proliferation
to further assess the antigenicity of algal-derived hgad <dig>  the effect of algal-derived hgad <dig> on spleen cell proliferation was analyzed. splenocytes were isolated from individual 8-week-old nod mice and cultured with medium alone or stimulated with insect cell-derived hgad <dig> standard, algal-derived hgad <dig>  or the irrelevant protein antigen ovalbumin . as shown in figure  <dig>  nod mouse-derived spleen cells proliferated significantly in response to in vitro stimulation with algal-derived hgad <dig>  with a magnitude of response comparable to the insect cell-derived hgad <dig> standard. in contrast, nod mouse-derived spleen cells cultured with medium alone or stimulated with ova showed no significant proliferative activity. the difference in cell response to algal-derived hgad <dig> and ova is significant . these results provide additional evidence that algal-derived hgad <dig> is indeed immunogenic.

discussion
the production of recombinant hgad <dig> has been achieved in a number of expression systems including insect cells and e. coli, but all have been limited by their efficiency. only low levels of hgad <dig> accumulation was obtained in baculovirus-infected sf <dig> insect cells  <cit> . moreover, this expression platform is technically and economically demanding, and hence is expensive and difficult to scale-up for mass production. the expression of hgad <dig> as a fusion protein has been demonstrated in e. coli  <cit> , but results in accumulation of recombinant product in insoluble inclusion bodies, needing solubilization, renaturation as well as chemical or enzymatic procedures to separate the target protein from its fusion partners. these additional processes can be expensive and time consuming. our recent demonstration that hgad <dig> can be expressed in transgenic tobacco may alleviate some of the problems associated with conventional expression platforms for hgad <dig> production  <cit> . however, plant genomic expression of hgad <dig> is still limited by low accumulation levels . here we report the use of algal chloroplasts as a new type of bioreactor for the production of hgad <dig>  c. reinhardtii transformed with the hgad <dig> gene under control of the chloroplast rbcl promoter and 5'-utr was produced. the site-specific integration of the transgene into the chloroplast genome of c. reinhardtii was demonstrated by pcr . rt-pcr analysis revealed viable expression of hgad <dig> mrna in c. reinhardtii transformants . the accumulation of recombinant hgad <dig> protein was further confirmed by western blotting using anti-gad antibody . as measured by elisa, c. reinhardtii derived hgad <dig> protein accounted for up to  <dig>  to  <dig> % of total algal soluble protein  . this value is much higher when compared to hgad <dig> expression in nuclear transgenic plants   <cit> . with a significant increase in immunologically active hgad <dig> accumulation, taken together with c. reinhardtii's rapid growth rate, it is obvious that microalgae represent a superior platform for hgad <dig> production. in addition, algae are one of the easiest living organisms to propagate, requiring only sunlight, carbon dioxyde and water to thrive. it can be easily grown to industrial levels at very low cost. there are several common methods that can be used to grow algae at large scale, including the use of ponds, cheap flexible plastic bags or a solar photoreactor. as only the unmodified native form of hgad <dig> gene under control of the chloroplast rbcl gene promoter and its 5'-utr was investigated in this pilot study, it is expected accumulation levels of hgad <dig> in algal cells could be improved further if a c. reinhardtii chloroplast codon-optimized version of hgad <dig> gene is used. the native hgad <dig> dna contains relatively low at content  and its expression may not be favored by an at-rich c. reinhardtii chloroplast genome in which the overall at content is  <dig> %  <cit> . franklin et al.  <cit>  showed an 80-fold increase in expression levels of gfp  in c. reinhardtii chloroplasts when a synthetic gfp gene with increased at content  was used. furthermore, as the 5'-utr region of chloroplast mrnas has a profound effect on the translational efficiency of c. reinhardtii chloroplast genes  <cit> , the use of different 5'-utrs of chloroplast genes such as the 5'-utr of the plastid psba gene , combined with a strong promoter, could serve as another approach to enhance hgad <dig> expression in c. reinhardtii cells. one additional strategy to improve hgad <dig> expression may be the use of different host strains of c. reinhardtii. mayfield and schultz  <cit>  reported a much higher expression  of the luciferase reporter gene in c. reinhardtii chloroplasts when it was expressed in a c. reinhardtii mutant strain that lacked the corresponding endogenous gene .

the antigenicity of algal-derived hgad <dig> was demonstrated based on its immunoreactivity with diabetic sera as well as its ability to stimulate the in vitro proliferation of splenic t cells derived from nod mice. anti-gad antibodies are present in >70% of newly diagnosed type  <dig> diabetic patients and have been detected up to  <dig> years before clinical onset of the disease  <cit> . measurement of anti-gad antibodies has been proposed as a better predictor for the future development of type  <dig> diabetes in people at high risk  <cit> . anti-gad antibodies are also present in the sera of a majority of nod mice and can be detected at an early stage of the disease  <cit> . our results indicate that algal-derived hgad <dig> reacts specifically with diabetic sera , suggesting its authentic gad antigenicity. the in vitro spleen cell proliferation assay provides further evidence that algal-derived hgad <dig> is immunogenic . in this assay, spleens derived from 8-week-old nod mice were used as a source of spleen cells. in nod mice, spontaneous proliferative t cell responses to gad <dig> is seen as early as  <dig> weeks of age, parallel to the onset of insulitis. also, the proliferative response is initially confined to limited regions on the gad <dig> molecule and subsequently spreads intramolecularly to different regions of gad <dig> and intermolecularly to other β cell antigens such as insulin  <cit> . kaufman et al.  <cit>  showed that spleen cells from 8-week-old nod mice proliferate in response to gad peptides. this study shows that nod mouse-derived spleen cells proliferate when stimulated with algal-derived hgad <dig>  and that the stimulatory activity of algal-derived hgad <dig> is comparable to insect cell-derived hgad <dig> standard. as expected, addition of an unrelated protein antigen  had little effect on the proliferation of nod mouse-derived spleen cells. the proliferation of spleen cells from one mouse  was not significantly altered by the stimulation with either algal-derived hgad <dig> or insect cell-derived hgad <dig> standard. this is most likely due to a lower frequency of gad reactive t cells within the spleen of this mouse as compared to other nod mice. this observation is supported by kaufman et al.  <cit>  who examined the in vitro proliferative responses of spleen cells from individual nod mice to gad stimulation and showed variations in their proliferative responses to gad.

the previous work by ruhlman et al.  <cit>  has showed the expression of diabetes-associated autoantigen human proinsulin in plant chloroplasts. in the present work, we have demonstrated the usefulness of c. reinhardtii chloroplasts as another platform for the production of diabetes-associated autoantigen hgad <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of algal chloroplasts for the production of a human autoantigenic protein. this demonstration opens the way for future use of c. reinhardtii chloroplasts as bioreactors for the production of other therapeutic proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
currently there are no efficient expression systems available for recombinant production of hgad <dig>  in the present study, we have demonstrated that transplastomic c. reinhardtii is a superior expression platform for the production of hgad <dig>  this is the first report on the use of c. reinhardtii chloroplasts for the production of a full-length autoantigenic protein. the ability to produce low-cost hgad <dig> in large quantities will facilitate the development of immunoassays useful for screening and monitoring large numbers of individuals for susceptibility to type  <dig> diabetes, and also for the treatment of patients with type  <dig> diabetes.
