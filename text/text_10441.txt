BACKGROUND
saccharina japonica is one of the most important commercial brown seaweeds with an aquaculture production of about  <dig> million tons  annually . besides serving as food, s. japonica is also used for alginate production  <cit> . presently nearly  <dig>  tons of algin are produced annually  <cit> .

alginate n is a β- <dig>  4-linked linear heteropolymer consisting of variable amounts of β-d-mannuronic acid  and its c5-epimer α-l-guluronic acid   <cit> . in the presence of divalent/trivalent cations, such as calcium, alginate can form algin, and its chemical properties vary with molecular weight and g/m ratio. algin abundance and properties are different for different species  <cit> , seasons  <cit> , and environment conditions  <cit> . algin possesses special gelling, viscosifying and stabilizing properties which gives it diverse applications in the food, textile, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.

alginate synthetic pathways exist in bacteria  and most marine brown seaweeds  <cit> . the synthetic pathway of bacterial alginate has been characterized in a. vinelandii and p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the enzymes involved, alga  <cit> , algc  <cit>  and algd  <cit> , are responsible for the synthesis of the precursor gdp-mannuronic acid, alg <dig> and alg <dig> are involved in the polymerization of gdp-mannuronic acid  <cit> , and algg epimerizes the d-mannuronate residues into l-guluronate  <cit> . the alginate synthetic mechanism is poorly understood in brown seaweeds. lin et al.  <cit>  initially proposed an alginate synthesis pathway for fucus gardner, which was further verified in ectocarpus siliculosus and s. japonica  <cit> . mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, phosphomannomutase, gdp-mannose 6-dehydrogenase , mannuronan synthase and mannuronate c5-epimerases  have been identified in both e. siliculosus and s. japonica  <cit> . but so far, in brown algae, only mc5e genes from l. digitata and the gmd gene from e. siliculosus have been characterised biochemically  <cit> . there is a need to carry out a functional analysis of the alginate synthetic genes in s. japonica.

generally, gmd has been regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme in the alginate synthesis pathway  <cit> . it catalyzes the synthesis of gdp-mannuronic acid with the reaction: gdp-mannose + 2nad+ + h2o → gdp-mannuronic + 2nadh. in bacterial genomes, gmd is a single copy gene  <cit> , while in the model brown alga e. siliculosus, it exists as a multi-copy gene, and only one gmd has been analyzed biochemically  <cit> .

based on our previous generated s. japonica transcriptome data  <cit> , two gmd genes from s. japonica  were isolated and a functional analysis was conducted. it is expected to shed light on the structures of sjgmds and their possible roles in algal adaptation to environmental stresses, to further enrich our understanding on the alginate synthesis in brown algae.

alignment and structure analysis of sjgmds
sjgmd <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids  while sjgmd <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids . a homology analysis showed that the sjgmd proteins shared high similarity with members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily. sjgmd <dig> shared  <dig>  % identity with a gmd gene from e. siliculosus , and sjgmd <dig> shared  <dig>  % identity with another gmd gene from e. siliculosus . however, the identity between sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> was only  <dig>  % with most of the variance occurring outside the conserved catalytic region. a multiple sequence alignment of gmds showed that both sjgmds contained the conserved nad+-binding motif gxgxvg  in the n-terminal region and the active motif ggxclpkdv  in the c-terminal domain . however, some key binding and catalytic residues differed between bacterial gmds and sjgmds, such as val , ala , val  and pro  . furthermore, as with the e. siliculosus gmds  <cit>  , sjgmds contained incomplete n-terminal rossmann folds. predictions of secondary structure indicated that sjgmd <dig> contained  <dig>  % random coil and  <dig>  % α-helix, while sjgmd <dig> contained  <dig>  % random coil and  <dig>  % α-helix.fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of sjgmds with gmds from other species. pseudomonas aeruginosa, wp_034074438; azotobacter vinelandii, aab01487; esi gmd_ <dig>  cbj27002; esi gmd_ <dig>  cbj <dig>  the conserved nad+-binding motif gxgxvg and the active motif ggxclpkdv are represented with red and green frames, respectively; the candidate nad+ and gdp-mannose binding sites of the sjgmds are represented with red and green dots, respectively



to understand the evolutionary history of gmd, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. all the brown algal gmds formed a single clade, while the bacterial gmds clustered into a separate clade . in addition, the brown algal clade tended to form two separate branches, each of which included one of the sjgmds. sjgmd <dig> was closer to e. siliculosus  <dig>  and e. siliculosus  <dig> , while sjgmd <dig> was closer to e. siliculosus  <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree constructed based on gmd sequences. the tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm with  <dig>  bootstrap replicates. ectocarpus siliculosus  <dig>  cbj26993; ectocarpus siliculosus  <dig>  cbj27002; ectocarpus siliculosus  <dig>  cbj29903; sargassum binderi, ests dv668856 + dv669914; sargassum thunbergii, sra073158; clostridium akagii, wp_026882540; clostridium litorale, wp_038266433; arsukibacterium ikkense, wp_046556127; streptomyces scabiei, wp_013000147; pseudomonas aeruginosa, wp_034074438; pseudomonas fluorescens, wp_042729895; azotobacter vinelandii, aab01487



expression of recombinant sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd2
mbp-sjgmd <dig> was successfully expressed after induction with  <dig>  mm iptg for 16 h at 25 °c, and its mw was consistent with the predicted mw of  <dig>  kda; while mbp-sjgmd <dig> was induced with  <dig>  mm iptg for 24 h at 15 °c, and its mw was consistent with the predicted mw of  <dig>  kda . after being cleaved with factor xa protease, the recombinant proteins were separated on sds-page , and had a mw of  <dig>  kda  and  <dig>  kda , respectively . as no difference was detected between the activities of the fusion proteins and of the cleaved proteins, the recombinant sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> proteins were analysed directly in the enzymatic activity assay. the purified fusion proteins were concentrated to a final concentration of 3 ~ 4 mg ml- <dig> for the enzymatic activity assays.

enzymatic assay of sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> activities
the optimal temperatures were 30 °c   and 20 °c  , and the optimal ph values were  <dig>    and  <dig>   , respectively. since these enzymes followed the typical michaelis-menten kinetics model, kinetic parameters were determined. the km values of sjgmd <dig> were 289 μm for gdp-mannose  and 139 μm for nad+ , while the km values of sjgmd <dig> were 177 μm for gdp-mannose  and 195 μm for nad+ . all the applied metal ions influenced the activity of sjgmds, among which, zncl <dig> and mncl <dig> were inhibitors of sjgmds, while mgcl <dig> increased the activity of sjgmds . what’s more, cacl <dig> acted as an activator of sjgmd <dig> but an inhibitor of sjgmd <dig> .fig.  <dig> influence of temperature and ph on the activity of sjgmds. a influence of temperature  on the activity of sjgmd <dig>  b influence of temperature  on the activity of sjgmd <dig>  c influence of ph values  on the activity of sjgmd <dig>  d influence of ph values  on the activity of sjgmd2

hplc and ms analysis of gdp-mannuronic acid
to confirm the catalytic activities of sjgmds, hplc analysis of the reaction solutions were conducted . figure 5a shows the peak of the substrate gdp-mannose ⑤. figure 5b shows that in the absence of gmd, only nad+ ① and gdp-mannose ⑤ can be detected. in the following chromatograms which monitored products at reaction times of 5 min  and 30 min , the peak areas of nadh ③ and gdp-mannuronic acid ⑥ increased with the reaction time, while that of nad+ ① and gdp-mannose ⑤ decreased significantly. this result demonstrated that gdp-mannuronic acid was oxidized from gdp-mannose, and both sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> were functional.fig.  <dig> hplc chromatography of sjgmd enzyme assays. a the separation of substrate gdp-mannose; b ~ d, the separation of enzyme assay after  <dig>   <dig> and 30 min, respectively. ①, nad+; ② and ④, unknown impurities from nad+; ③, nadh; ⑤, gdp-mannose; ⑥, gdp-mannuronic acid



ms analysis showed that gdp-mannuronic acid and nadh could be easily identified from the high abundance trace, consistent with the predicted mass at  <dig> and  <dig> . in addition, collision induced dissociation  fragmentation of the supposed gdp-mannuronic acid peak resulted in the loss of mannuronic acid or mannuronic acid without the phosphoric acid . these results further verified the production of gdp-mannuronic acid.fig.  <dig> ms spectrum. a negative-ion mode esi-ms spectrum of assay mixture in a range of 500 ~  <dig>  b negative-ion mode esi-cid-ms/ms spectra of gdp-mannuronic acid  in a mass range of 250 ~ 650



transcriptional analysis of the sjgmds
under heat and desiccation stresses, sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> exhibited the same transcriptional profiles . after heat treatment, the level of sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> transcripts increased significantly  and reached a peak after 1 h , followed by an remarkable decrease to the original level at  <dig>  h. a similar trend was detected under desiccation stress, the level of sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> transcripts reached a maximum after 1 h .fig.  <dig> influence of heat and desiccation treatments on sjgmd genes transcription level. a expression level of sjgmds under duration of heat stress. b expression level of sjgmds under duration of desiccation stress. the treatment groups which had significant difference  with the controls were noted. all the data are the mean values of three independent experiments



discussion
two novel gmd genes from s. japonica were isolated and characterized in this study. the alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the variance between the two gmds in s. japonica is higher than that between s. japonica and e. siliculosus. this indicated that the two sjgmd genes might have envolved from different gmds rather than being derived from a duplication event that happened in s. japonica. previous research indicated that gmds in brown algae had been gained by horizontal transfer of a single gmd from a bacterium  <cit> . thus we proposed the gmd duplication event happened before the divergence of brown algae.

the crystal structure of gmd from p. aeruginosa has been reported and it showed that the enzyme contained two distinct domains connected by an r-helix and that both the n- and the c-terminal domains have a typical dinucleotide-binding rossmann fold  <cit> . although the characterized sjgmds contained conserved motifs and residues, incomplete n-terminal rossmann folds and residue substitutions were identified in sjgmds, similar to the situation observed in e. siliculosus. these results suggested that brown algal gmds may have a novel binding mechanism, suggesting distinct biochemical properties between gmds in brown algae and in bacteria.

though catalyzing the same reaction, the biochemical properties of sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> are quite different. the lower induction temperature indicated that sjgmd <dig> forms inclusion bodies more easily. the optimum temperature of sjgmd <dig>  was the same as that of e. siliculosus gmd  <cit> , while that of sjgmd <dig>  was quite different from the gmds of both p. aeruginosa   <cit>  and e. siliculosus . the optimal phs  of sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> were similar to those of p. aeruginosa  and arthrobacter sp.   <cit> . this implied that the two sjgmds exhibited different enzymatic activities. the km of sjgmds were much higher than those of bacterial gmds  <cit> , as which was found for e. siliculosus gmd. this may be explained by the fact that gdp-mannose is the common substrate of alginate and fucan synthesis, in that a lower km might be beneficial for fucan formation  <cit> . moreover, the activities of sigmds can be greatly affected by metal ions. zn2+ was a strong inhibitor of both sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig>  this can be explained by its higher oxidability which might lead an oxidation of the catalytic residue cys , while mg2+ can activate sjgmds by improving the binding of substrate. more importantly, ca2+ had contrasting effects on sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig>  which may be due to the structures of sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> undergoing different changes in configuration when bound to ca2+. this suggested that, ca2+ may act as a regulatory factor for sjgmd activities when the inside and outside environment of the cell change.

s. japonica is cold-temperate algal specie, distributed in the subtropical region of the northwest coast of the pacific ocean. temperature and light are major factors that influence its growth. desiccation can also threaten its survival. under abiotic stresses, s. japonica can adjust its physiological and metabolic processes to acclimate and survive adverse conditions  <cit> . as the first line of defense, the cell wall of brown algae can thicken to increase algal tolerance to stresses  <cit> . alginate is the one of the major components of the brown algal cell wall, accounting for 45 % of the cell dry weight  <cit> . thus, the increased alginate production might contribute to cell wall thickening. under heat and desiccation stresses, the transcriptional level of sjgmds increased rapidly in a short time. this result indicated that s. japonica increases alginate synthesis by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in the synthetic pathway. sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> expression may contribute significantly to the adaptability of s. japonica in coastal environments, to assure normal growth of alga.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, two novel genes encoding gmd in s. japonica were cloned and verified. the sjgmds exhibited sequence and structure differences and quite different biochemical properties and enzyme kinetics. the abundance of both sjgmds transcripts increased under abiotic stresses, and this may contribute to a better adaptability of s. japonica. the knowledge obtained here enriched our understanding of alginate synthesis in brown algae, and provided a hint to study the functional differences between gmd genes.
