BACKGROUND
in a living eukaryotic cell, the nuclear envelope is a critical barrier between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which prevents macromolecules from freely exchanging between the two compartments. the eukaryotic cells have developed multiple pathways designed to transport various types of macromolecules through specialized channels that are incorporated within the nuclear envelope. there are four major components involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, including cargos, receptors, nuclear pore complex , and ran  <cit> . cargos are proteins, rnas or ribonucleoprotein  particles that contain either nuclear localization signals destined for import into the nucleus from the cytoplasm or nuclear export signals destined for export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  <cit> .

nxf  family members  play essential roles in rna exporting out of the nucleus  <cit>  through npc. the structure of the founding member, nxf <dig> , has modular organization consisting of four major domains: a noncanonical rnp-type rna-binding domain , four leucine-rich repeats , an internal domain sharing significant sequence homology with the nuclear transport factor  <dig>  and a c-terminal ubiquitin associated -like domain. the rbd domain and lrrs are responsible for recognition and binding of rnas through rnp and cte . the uba-like domain interacts with multiple nuleoporins of npc. the ntf2-like domain heterodimerizes with another protein, nxt <dig>  <cit> .

nxt <dig> was initially identified from human based on its sequence homology to ntf <dig>   <cit>  and association with the rna exporting factor nxf1/tap  <cit> . earlier studies suggested that nxt <dig> was necessary for crm1-mediated nuclear export of proteins  <cit> , in which nxt <dig> directly binds to export receptor crm <dig> and rangtp , and efficiently stimulates the release of cargos in the cytoplasm after translocation through npc  <cit> . however, recent experiments demonstrated that nxt <dig> appears to exclusively participate, independently of ran and crm <dig>  in tap-mediated nuclear export of rnas. this finding has been widely confirmed in yeasts, drosophila, c. elegans and vertebrates  <cit> . it was shown that formation of a nxf1/nxt heterodimer via ntf2-like domain is required for the nuclear export of rnas in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . recently, another member, nxt <dig> , was identified to be able to substitute nxt <dig> in forming nxf1/nxt heterodimers  <cit> . nxt <dig> has two alternative splicing variants of transcripts encoding p15-2a and p15-2b proteins that differ in the first exon  <cit> . to date, the function of nxt <dig> variants has not been elucidated.

we previously generated cloned zebrafish from long-term cultured fibroblast cells infected with a retrovirus expressing gfp reporter gene  <cit> . we bred the gfp transgene to homozygosity and found that one of the cloned fish lines bore a recessive embryonic lethal mutation, suggesting that viral insertion is the cause of the cardiac defect. more interestingly, the mutant embryos have reduced circulation, cardiac edema and aberrant heart valve formation after three days of development. sectioning of homozygous mutant embryos revealed that the ventricular wall is thinner and the space between the myocardium and endocardium is enlarged. molecular analysis of these mutants revealed that nxt <dig> was disrupted by the viral insertion. whole-mount rna in situ hybridization detected nxt <dig> expression in the heart as well as other tissues. rt-pcr analysis suggested that nxt <dig> has multiple alternative mrna splicing forms and intriguingly, one of them is significantly reduced in mutant embryos. morpholino knockdown of this specific splicing form reproduced the mutant phenotypes. taken together, our data demonstrate that nxt <dig> has a critical role in the morphogenetic integrity of the embryonic heart in zebrafish, and provide the first functional study of nxt <dig> in a vertebrate animal species.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of a cloned zebrafish exhibiting heart defects
cloned zebrafish were obtained by nuclear transfer  <cit>  from long-term cultured cells that were infected with retrovirus  <cit>  containing a gfp reporter gene driven by the xenopus ef <dig> alpha promoter. it has been shown that retroviral integration can cause mutations in zebrafish  <cit> . we therefore bred all of the cloned fish lines to homozygous for gfp to screen for abnormality. one of these lines exhibited specific heart defects. the mutant phenotype co-segregated with proviral gfp expression , suggesting that the heart defects were caused by disruption of a functional gene by retroviral insertion. the mutant embryos were first distinguishable from their wild-type siblings by slightly dilated heart, slow heart rate, circulation reduction and mild pericardial edema after  <dig> days of development . at this stage, cardiac function assays showed that the atrium and ventricle both contracted rhythmically in a normal atrio-venticular sequence. but, the heartbeat rates of mutants  were statistically significantly  slower than that of their wild-type siblings  and the significant difference remained at  <dig> days post fertilization  . furthermore, while the wild-type embryos  develop a narrow heart with forward blood flow through the embryo, both cardiac chambers are dilated in the enlarged pericardial sac  and blood cells regurgitated between ventricle and atrium, resulting in either pooling the blood cells in two heart chambers or peripheral veins of mutant embryos at 4– <dig> dpf . by  <dig> dpf, the mutant hearts are stretched to a long tubular structure . pericardial edema became prominent, circulation was completely terminated and severe edema appeared in the whole abdominal cavity, leading to necrosis in fin, muscle, skin and other tissues .

the reduced circulation and regurgitation defects may be the results of abnormalities in cardiac contractibility, differentiation of cardiomyocytes or the formation of cardiac valve. to further investigate these possibilities, we analyzed histological sections of wild type and mutant embryos. normally, by  <dig> dpf, the ventricular myocardial cells thicken and become the primary pumping force of the heart. we found that in  <dig> dpf mutant embryos, the ventricular wall remains thin and the space between myocardium and endocardium was diminished in the ventricle but enlarged in the atrium compared to that of wild type embryos . in addition, we frequently observed mutant samples lacking cardiac valve structure. in  <dig> dpf mutant embryos, the ventricular wall remained thinner and cardiac chambers were severely dilated . these data suggested that myocardial structures were disturbed in mutant embryos during early development.

various heart chamber-specific gene expressions demarcate vertebrate heart compartments and play an important role in regulating critical steps of chamber formation. to understand whether the identified mutation affects formation of specific chambers and morphogenetic movements of dynamic cardiomyocycte, expression of chamber-specific genes including vmhc, amhc and cmlc <dig> was examined. as shown in fig 1l–q, no difference was detected in expressions of amhc , vmhc  and cmlc <dig>  between wild-type  and mutant  embryos at  <dig> dpf , suggesting that the mutated gene is not required for the initial chamber-specific differentiation of cardiomyocytes, in which amhc, cmlc <dig> and vmhc play important roles  <cit> .

epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  plays a critical role in atrio-ventricular valve formation. in the zebrafish, this process begins at  <dig> hpf, when the myocardial cells at the atrio-ventricular boundary induce the adjacent endocardial cells to undergo emt <cit> . bmp <dig> and versican  are genes involved in cardiac valve formation. coincidently, their cardiac expressions become restricted to the myocardial cells at the valve forming region at the same time as the formation of the prevalvular cushions, suggesting that they are thereby markers for the differentiation of the myocardial cells in the valve forming region and misexpression of these genes may indicate defects in valve formation <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> , expression of versican and bmp <dig> in mutant embryos  was broadly up-regulated and expanded throughout the two heart chambers at  <dig> dpf at which stage their expression should be restricted to the atrioventricular boundary as in wild-type embryos . meanwhile, no difference of versican expression  was detected in the otoliths of developing ears in wild-type and mutant embryos  <cit> , suggesting that the abnormal versican expression pattern is due to heart defects observed in these mutant embryos other than general developmental delay.

nxt <dig> is responsible for heart defects
of the  <dig> analyzed mutated embryos, the heart defect always co-segregate with the proviral gfp expression, suggesting that the viral insertion causes the observed heart phenotypes. by analyzing the genomic dna by southern blot, we found that there is a single viral insertion in this fish line . a  <dig> bp genomic sequence flanking the viral insertion was isolated by inverse pcr and used to search est databases, leading to the identification of a candidate gene encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein that shares high homology with that of nxt <dig> and/or nxt <dig> from human, mouse, rat, drosophila and c. elegans. by comparing genomic structures of nxt <dig> and nxt <dig> genes from these species, we noticed that nxt <dig> was encoded by a single exon whereas nxt <dig> gene contains multiple exons, which is similar to our candidate gene . based on similarities in protein sequences  and genomic organizations, we concluded that our candidate gene represents a homolog of nxt <dig> rather than nxt1and named it znxt <dig> 

to determine the expression pattern of znxt <dig>  we carried out rna whole mount in situ hybridization with its sense and antisense rna probes. it was found that znxt <dig> was ubiquitously expressed during early embryogenesis but clearly detectable in heart at  <dig> dpf .

znxt2a is the alternatively spliced transcript required for heart function
search for znxt <dig> homologues revealed that one copy of nxt gene exists in drosophila, c. elegans and mouse whereas two copies are present in rat  and human  genomes, respectively . in humans, two alternative splicing variants of nxt <dig>  were identified in est database, which were further confirmed by cloning and sequencing the corresponding cdnas  <cit> . in order to determine if znxt <dig> also has multiple alternative rna transcripts, 5' race analysis was performed  <cit>  and the pcr products were sequenced. from  <dig> sequences obtained,  <dig> represented the original znxt <dig> encoding  <dig> amino acid protein as mentioned above ,  <dig> lacked the third exon, and  <dig> did not have the first two exons and part of third exon. the last variant, now named znxt2b, appeared to be transcribed from the third exon and started at the putative codon gtg . the same observation has also been made in humans in that the second splicing variant nxt2b starts from the putative initiation codon gtg  <cit> . the putative znxt2b protein contains most of the functional domains of znxt2a, since they share the last two identical exons.

to determine which transcript is responsible for the mutant phenotype we compared znxt2a and znxt2b mrna expression level in mutant and wild type embryos. two sets of primers, ntf/ntr for the first and the fourth exon to detect znxt2a and nxtf/nxtmr for the fourth and the fifth exon to detect both znxt2a and znxt2b, were designed for rt-pcr analysis . as shown in fig 3b, znxt2a expression level was dramatically reduced in homozygous mutant embryos  compared to their wild-type or heterozygous siblings whereas no difference of mrna levels was observed when both znxt2a and znxt2b were detected using nxtf/nxtmr primers. taken together, these data suggested that loss of znxt2a transcripts might be responsible for this mutant phenotype.

blocking znxt2a activity by morphlino phenocopies the mutant heart defects
morpholino technology is a powerful tool for blocking translation of specific mrna transcripts and has been extensively used in zebrafish  <cit> . to further verify that znxt2a was responsible for the observed heart defects, an antisense morpholino oligo specific to this transcript was injected in wild type embryos at one to four-cell stage. analysis of more than  <dig> embryos from multiple injected clutches showed that approximately 80% of injected embryos developed the same heart defects as that in the virus-induced mutant embryos , including pericardial edema, slightly dilated heart, slow heart rate and reduced circulation. mock-injections have no effect on heart development in control embryos .

the ability to use morpholinos to reproduce znxt2a mutant phenotypes allowed us to confirm cardiac defects observed in living mutant embryos  through using live transgenic zebrafish embryos expressing gfp in specific cell lineages. first, cardiac myosin light chain  <dig>  promoter driving gfp transgenic zebrafish  <cit>  embryos were used to determine development of two heart chambers. as shown in fig  <dig>  heart chambers of morpholino injected embryos at  <dig> dpf exhibited pericardial edema and dilated heart compared with that of wild-type embryos . in 4– <dig> dpf morpholino injected embryos, cardiac chambers became abnormally stretched and relative positions of two chambers were abnormal  whereas wild-type embryos had heart chambers in a narrowed pericardial sac . this finding is consistent with the previous results described based on viral insertional mutated embryos .

we further examined endocardial morphology at the atrioventricular valve region using receptor tyrosine kinase flk- <dig> promoter driving rfp transgenic zebrafish embryos. previously, tie- <dig> gfp transgenic zebrafish has been used to address this issue. similar to tie- <dig>  flk- <dig> also plays a crucial and unique role in endothelial cell differentiation and vascular morphogenesis, including vessels and heart endocardium  <cit> . in uninjected wild-type embryos, endocardial cells cluster at the atrioventrivular boundary and form a ring shape structure at the valve forming region . however, more than 70% of the znxt2a morpholino injected flk-1-rfp transgenic embryos  failed to form this cluster , suggesting that znxt <dig> is required for this early endocardial morphogenetic event. together with rna whole mount in situ data of bmp <dig> and versican, these results indicate that cardiomyocyte differentiation and thickening of the endocardium at the atrioventricular boundary in the mutant embryos were significantly impaired, resulting in abnormal valve formation.

discussion
ventricular myocardial thickening and atrioventricular valve are impaired by disruption of znxt2a
in zebrafish, between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, the linear heart tube gradually bends at the boundary of two chambers to create an s-shaped loop. meanwhile, clustering of endocardial cells as a ring structure at the atrioventrocular boundary by 33– <dig> hpf initiates the first step of the formation of cardiac valve  <cit> . while the heart is pumping, differentiation and morphogenesis continue, which includes remodeling of the cardiac valve to completion, finally building on a linear heart tube to produce an adult heart.

sectioning of znxt2a homozygous mutant embryos revealed that the ventricular wall is thinner as early as  <dig> dpf . decreased cell proliferation and/or increased apoptosis may cause such a defect. since the thinner myocardial wall appears very early during development we prefer a model that the under-developed ventricular wall is due to a deficiency in myocardial cell proliferation. alternatively, this could result from abnormally tight intercalation of ventricular cells with the same numbers of cells in the mutant embryos as previously described  <cit> . in regard to the atrioventricular valve defect, it has been reported that endothelial shear stress  plays a critical role in endocardial cushion by using special surgical experiments in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . in contrast, other researchers  <cit>  argued that reduction in myocardial function is primarily responsible for the defect in atrioventricular cushion development, which was observed in sih  and cfk  mutant embryos. in znxt <dig> mutant embryos, the earliest observable defects are reduced heart rate, dilated cardiac chambers and a thin ventricular myocardial wall. heart morphology and chamber specification ascertained by expression of amhc, vmhc and cmlc <dig> are all normal at this stage in mutant embryos . later on from 3– <dig> dpf, the atrioventricular valve was aberrant and the relative position of atrium and ventricle was perturbed, as revealed by sectioning analysis, expression of versican and bmp <dig>  and morpholino knockdown in cmlc2-gfp and flk-gfp transgenic embryos , respectively. additionally, injection of a higher dose  of znxt2a morpholino into embryos causes defective endocardial cushion formation as early as  <dig> dpf, as illustrated by a failure of endocardial clustering at atrioventricular boundary . this indicates that valve malformation resulted by interruption of znxt2a might be either a primary defect or a defect due to disturbed function of chambers at later stage. in addition, our data implies that the mutant cardiac valve malformation is either an independent event or caused by lacking of myocardial cell proliferation or differentiation. the later situation will be consistent with the observation by bartman et al . nonetheless, our findings establish that znxt <dig> has a critical role in driving cardiac valve formation to final completion.

znxt2a is the mrna transcript variant responsible for heart defects
as in humans, znxt <dig> has multiple alternative splicing mrna transcripts with two distinct start sites  . it is possible that different znxt <dig> splicing variants are differentially expressed in different tissues. moreover, znxt2b starting from gtg may represent a major transcript because of its higher copy numbers in the amplified cdna pools  whereas znxt2a starting from atg might be enriched in heart. the biological significance of such a variation in nxt <dig> transcription has not been addressed. our studies demonstrated that the alternatively spliced transcripts might have specific functions in different tissues during embryonic development and organogenesis. specifically, znxt2a appears to be required for heart development in zebrafish. viral insertion in the intron immediately upstream of the exon containing atg caused specific knockdown of znxt2a transcription in mutant embryos whereas other transcripts such as znxt2b appear normal. injection of a morpholino against znxt2a can phenocopy heart defects, confirming that znxt2a protein is the main factor required for zebrafish heart development. furthermore, when the morpholino dose was increased, more injected embryos developed pericardial edema one day earlier than the insertional mutants of znxt <dig> . this suggests that our znxt2a insertional mutant may be a hypomorphic allele due to insertion of the viral vector into a non-coding region of the locus. with morpholino data it is clear that znxt2a is directly implicated in heart development that requires its sufficient expression activity.

nuclear transport factors are implicated in tissue-specific biological functions
nuclear protein or rna transporting has previously been regarded as a general house keeping function for all biological systems. however, increasing evidence suggest that this can be a highly regulated process for specific biological functions with specific rna targets. in drosophila, studies demonstrated that homolog of ntf <dig>  is required for nuclear translocation of the rel proteins dorsal, dif and relish into the nucleus. these three rel proteins are activated in response to immune challenges and imported into the nucleus upon microbial challenges, which further induce and regulate transcriptions of anti-microbial peptides attacin, cecropin, defensin, metchnikowin, diptericin and drosomycin. disruption of dntf <dig> leads to impairment of nuclear import of the rel proteins and thus immune response is impaired in ntf mutants compared with wild type  <cit> . nxf <dig>  a member of the nuclear export factor nxf family, binds to rnas as well as to nxt members for rna nuclear export. in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation, a nonfunctional nxf <dig> was identified, which is split by the breakpoint situated in the 5' utr between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of nxf <dig>  this suggests that interruption of the gene nxf <dig> might result in the disease phenotypes associated with syndromic mental retardation including short stature, general muscle wasting, and facial dysmorphism by deranging the export or transport of specific mrnas  <cit> .

formation of an nxt <dig>  and tap  heterodimer is critically required for mrna export from the nucleus via tap/nxt <dig> pathway  <cit> . earlier experiments demonstrated that nxt <dig> is essential in crm1-mediated nuclear export of proteins, in which nxt <dig> directly binds to export receptor crm <dig> and rangtp, and improves the release of cargos into the cytoplasm after translocation through the npc  <cit> . very recently, it has been reported that crm <dig> is involved in export of specific subsets of cellular rnas, which include tra- <dig> mrna participating in sex cell fate determination in c. elegans and ifn-a <dig> mrna generated upon viral infection to human cells  <cit> . however, little is known about how their cofactor nxt <dig>  plays a role in a biological pathway. our finding provides the first evidence that an alternative splicing form of nuclear transport factor nxt <dig> is specifically implicated in heart development of zebrafish. for future studies, identification of specific rna targets and elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying nxt2-mediated exporting of these targets, either mrna or micro rna, in heart should be the focus. in addition, this study might provide the basis for some inheritable cardiac valve diseases in human. it should be a reasonable step to determine genetic linkage relationship between a nxt <dig> locus and defined cardiac diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that disruption of nxt <dig> gene, a member of nxt  family, is responsible for heart-specific defects in a mutant zebrafish generated by a retroviral insertion introduced into the genome by animal cloning technology. our study suggests that nxt <dig> has critical roles required for myocardial cell differentiation and formation of cardiac valve at the atrioventricular boundary. since nxt <dig> is highly conserved between fish and man it is conceivable that it may also play a role in mammalian heart development and might be involved in cardiac diseases.
