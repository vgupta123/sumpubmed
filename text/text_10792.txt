BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  is an important cause of gastroenteritis in humans  <cit> . the epec pathotype is subdivided into typical epec  and atypical epec , where the main difference between the two subgroups is the presence of the large virulence eaf  plasmid  in tepec and its absence in aepec  <cit> . peaf encodes bundle-forming pilus , a type iv fimbria, which mediates a localized adherence  pattern in vitro, and is characterized by the formation of compact microcolonies on the surface of hela/hep- <dig> cells  <cit> .

the hallmark of epec pathogenesis is a histopathologic lesion termed attaching and effacing  lesion, which is characterized by intimate bacterial adherence to enterocytes and effacement of microvilli  <cit> . the ae lesion is a consequence of the interaction between the outer membrane protein intimin and its receptor tir , which is translocated through a type  <dig> secretion system  into eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the genes involved in the ae lesion phenotype are localized in the pathogenicity island termed locus of enterocyte effacement or lee region  <cit> .

attachment comprises a critical stage to avoid displacement of bacteria from its preferential site in the gut by the continuous flow of intestinal contents. the initial step in attachment of different diarrheagenic e. coli  pathotypes to the host intestinal epithelium is usually mediated by fimbrial and afimbrial adhesins  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that environmental conditions may regulate the expression of dec virulence-encoding genes including adhesins and t3ss-dependent effectors . in a tepec strain, serotype o111:h−, puente and coworkers found that bfp expression was increased at higher glucose concentrations, suggesting that tepec preferentially colonizes the proximal small intestine, where the glucose concentration is greater than 25 mm  <cit> . this hypothesis was further confirmed in experiments employing an in vitro organ culture  adhesion assay with intestinal tissues obtained from children  <cit> .

several studies in the literature have focused on identifying new putative adhesive structures, and the adherence pattern resulting from the interaction between these bacterial structures and host cells. however, particularly in aepec, very few studies have tried to understand how the intestinal environment may favor or prevent this interaction.

we previously identified an aepec strain, 1551– <dig> , which displays the la pattern in hela cells in the absence of bfp  <cit> . in the present study we evaluated the adherence pattern and colonization efficiency of aepec 1551– <dig> in hela cells cultivated at different co <dig> and glucose concentrations and in the presence of bile salts.

RESULTS
aepec 1551– <dig> strain adheres more efficiently to hela cells in an atmosphere supplemented with co2
quantitative assays demonstrated that the different glucose concentrations tested  did not promote substantial alterations in the adhesiveness of aepec 1551– <dig> , as observed in figure 1a. however, air atmosphere with 5% co <dig> favored bacterial-cell interaction, since the number of associated bacteria increased  <dig> -fold at 5 mm glucose and  <dig> -fold at 25 mm glucose, when compared with results obtained in assays performed in a normal air atmosphere  .figure  <dig>

to exclude the possibility of differences in bacterial growth rate in the different environmental conditions tested, a growth curve  was determined. bacterial growth rates were not affected by the different conditions tested , indicating that the difference observed in the quantitative adherence assays was due to the modification of the air atmosphere by the elevation of co <dig> concentration to 5%.

high glucose concentration modifies the adherence pattern of 1551– <dig> strain to hela cells
regarding the aepec 1551– <dig> adherence pattern, the la originally identified by vieira and coworkers  <cit>  was only detected in the presence of low glucose, independently of the co <dig> concentration used . on the other hand, at high glucose concentration, we identified a hybrid adherence pattern, in which la was observed concurrently with an aggregative adherence-like  pattern on the hela cell and on the glass slide surface  .

the aa-like pattern of 1551– <dig> strain is dependent on type  <dig> pilus  production at high glucose concentration
since t1p is so far the only adhesin, besides intimin, identified in the 1551– <dig> strain , we hypothesized that the aa-like pattern would depend on t1p production. to investigate the contribution of t1p in the establishment of the aa-like pattern, we first evaluated the relative expression of the fima gene  at two glucose concentrations . by comparing the experiments performed in medium supplemented with different glucose concentrations, it was possible to observe an increase in fima gene expression  in experiments performed in medium with high glucose .figure  <dig>

, 1551-2Δfima   and 1551-2Δfima  . the 1551-2Δfima mutant maintained the la pattern on hela cells, but the aa-like pattern was no longer observed, pointing to the involvement of t1p in the establishment of this phenotype. * and ** indicate statistical differences observed between experiments performed at  <dig> and 25 mm glucose after 3 h  and 6 h  of incubation, respectively.



furthermore, we employed an isogenic fima mutant  to test the adherence pattern of this strain at high glucose. these experiments demonstrated that in contrast with the wild type aepec 1551– <dig> , the 1551-2Δfima strain displayed only the la pattern, while the aa-like pattern was completely abolished . these findings clearly point to an association between glucose concentration and t1p production, since the isogenic mutant no longer produced the aa-like pattern, even in the presence of high glucose concentration . complementation of the fima mutant with the pfima recombinant plasmid restored its ability to produce the la/aa-like pattern in the presence of high glucose . the 1551-2Δfima strain carrying empty pbadmyc-his a vector  produced la on hela cells but was unable to produce the aa-like pattern , confirming that l-arabinose did not affect the adherence phenotype of the complemented strain.table  <dig>

presence of bile salts does not interfere with the adhesion properties of 1551– <dig> strain with hela cells
the presence of bile salts caused no significant alterations in the adhesive properties of aepec 1551– <dig> to epithelial cells . under all conditions tested, the adherence pattern and the amount of bacteria associated with hela cells were not significantly different, indicating that bile salts did not influence bacterial colonization.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed some environmental factors that could influence the colonization process of aepec 1551– <dig> strain in the intestinal environment, by mimicking characteristics  commonly found in different parts of the intestines.

we observed that the efficiency of bacterial association rose approximately two fold in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere, independently of the glucose concentration employed . according to described by babb , hydrogen, nitrogen and co <dig> are the three prevailing gases present in the intestine, with co <dig> concentrations varying between  <dig>  and 29%  <cit> . due to experimental limitations, only  <dig> % and 5% co <dig> were tested.

haigh and co-workers showed improved protein secretion by the tepec e2348/ <dig> strain in the presence of 5% co <dig>  independently of the presence of eukaryotic cells  <cit> . however, kenny and coworkers questioned the actual influence of high co <dig> concentrations in improving bacterial protein secretion, since, in the adherence assays performed in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere, sodium bicarbonate is added to the culture medium to buffer the acidic ph induced by the higher co <dig> concentration  <cit> . therefore, the higher protein concentrations observed in such situations could be due to the presence of sodium bicarbonate instead of co <dig>  since co <dig>  stimulate epec protein secretion, we believe that the increased adhesiveness of aepec 1551– <dig> in the atmosphere supplemented with 5% co <dig> could be related to increased secretion of the epec secreted proteins that form the t3ss-translocon , in view of the fact that this structure interacts with epithelial cells  <cit> . in addition, in our previous studies, the t3ss-translocon was shown to mediate aepec 1551– <dig> adherence to hela cells in the absence of intimin  <cit> . of note, intimin mediates the intimate bacterial attachment observed in the formation of ae lesions  <cit> .

during the flow through the small intestine, glucose is rapidly absorbed, reaching a concentration higher than 25 mm in the duodenum, dropping to less than 5 mm in the ileum, until it is undetectable in the jejunum, depending on the host’s diet  <cit> . quantitative experiments to evaluate the efficiency of bacterial interaction with hela cells showed no statistical difference between the numbers of associated bacteria when assays were performed in the presence of  <dig> or 25 mm glucose at the same co <dig> concentration .

however, regardless of the co <dig> concentration used, two distinct adherence patterns were detected depending on the glucose concentration present in the culture medium. at 5 mm glucose, bacteria adhered in the la pattern, originally reported by vieira and coworkers  <cit> , whereas at 25 mm glucose, a hybrid pattern consisting of la and aa-like patterns was seen. previous studies by our laboratory found that in contact with hela cells the 1551– <dig> strain produces t1p  <cit> . in addition, this strain lacks adhesin-encoding genes that are commonly found in other diarrheagenic e. coli pathotypes and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli , as shown in previous studies .

in the present study, we showed that fima expression increased  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, in the period between  <dig> and 6 h, when 25 mm glucose was used as compared to 5 mm glucose. various studies in the literature have shown that glucose influences the expression of fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins. our results are in accordance with previous studies showing that adhesins such as the bundle-forming pilus , colonization factor antigens  and toxin-coregulated pilus  are positively regulated by high glucose concentrations  <cit> . müller and coworkers reported that two uropathogenic e. coli strains responded in opposite ways regarding fimbriation in the presence of camp receptor protein  and 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate  complex by phase variation of fima promoter  <cit> . crp-camp is a signaling protein complex formed when there is a reduction in glucose concentration in the environment  <cit> . therefore, the crp-camp complex can induce the fima promoter in the absence of glucose. however, in the presence of glucose and absence of crp-camp, a complex of lrp , dna gyrase and fimb  raise the amount of fimbriated bacteria in the population by maintaining the phase variation of fima promoter in the on position, reflecting a glucose–dependent event  <cit> . in our study, we found that the aa-like pattern of the 1551– <dig> strain depended on the presence of a high glucose concentration, leading us to hypothesize that the increased fima expression in the later incubation periods corresponded to a glucose-dependent phenotype.

in contrast to the wild-type strain, the isogenic fima mutant lost the ability to produce the aa-like pattern, even when the assay was performed in medium supplemented with high glucose concentration, confirming the influence of this sugar in the establishment of the aa-like pattern. the involvement of t1p in the aa pattern was first described in enteroaggregative e. coli  prototype strain  <dig>  by mutating the fimd gene . the fimd mutant strain was approximately 80% less adherent to hep- <dig> cells than the wild-type strain  <cit> . additionally, t1p has been implicated in biofilm formation in both eaec  and aepec  strains, reinforcing the involvement of this adhesin in the pathogenesis of diarrheagenic e. coli strains  <cit> .

as suggested by edwards and puente, a combination of environmental signals may provide an intestinal map to identify an appropriate niche for bacterial colonization  <cit> . the differences in the adherence patterns on hela cells under some diverse environmental conditions could reflect the differential expression of adhesin-encoding genes in the distinct parts of the intestine. in view of the evidence that under high glucose concentration the modification in the adherence pattern from la to la/aa-like was not associated with an increase of the number of associated bacteria, we can hypothesize that t1p production can negatively interfere with microcolony formation in experiments performed in this circumstance. therefore, the higher level of t1p production in 25 mm glucose could suggest that these fimbriae are involved in the first steps of the association of aepec1551- <dig> with the proximal small intestine, where the highest glucose concentration is detected  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our data suggest that a co2-enriched atmosphere could favor aepec adhesion to the host cells, whereas enhanced t1p production under high glucose concentration could allow bacteria to access more extensive intestinal colonization sites in the host at the beginning of the infectious process.
