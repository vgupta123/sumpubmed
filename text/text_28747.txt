BACKGROUND
enu mutagenesis is a popular method to introduce single nucleotide mutations in the mouse genome  <cit> . owing to availability or experimental preferences, different inbred mouse strains are submitted to this procedure. before massive sequencing technologies became available, phenotype-related enu-induced mutations were short-listed in a lengthy procedure of out-crossing and meiotic mapping that identified linkage chromosomes, or finer linkage regions of approximately 20 mb. since the bulk of phenotype-causing mutations identified to date after enu mutagenesis are exonic, exome sequencing would be a welcome method to speed up this process, provided that it allows to narrow down sufficiently the list of variants that will be then submitted to experimental validation.

for the large-scale munich enu mutagenesis project  <cit>  the c3heb/fej  strain was chosen due to the observed high mutation loads and fertility rates following enu treatment in early pilot studies. the strain showed a good tolerance of the mutagen with low mortality and high fertility rates  <cit> . moreover, once archived by cryo-preservation good results for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer were observed  <cit> .

whole genome sequencing can be performed without existing reference sequence nor functional annotations, and exome sequencing for almost any mouse strain used in the lab could be performed using standard mouse exome capture kits based on the biological similarity of the captured sequences and a moderate mismatch tolerance of the capture probes  <cit> . however, high quality alignments and variant calling depend on a quality reference sequence. if the genome of the sample is very different from the reference sequence, not only a much higher number of variants will be detected, but many reads will not be mapped altogether due to a limited number of mismatches allowed by the mapping algorithm. furthermore, phenotypes are most commonly related to altered or dysfunctional proteins; therefore, functional genome annotations such as gene and exon boundaries are required to classify variants and to select possible causative mutations. the standard mouse reference genome, ucsc mm <dig> , has been thoroughly annotated in this respect, and there is an effort to generate genome assemblies for several alternative mouse strains  <cit> . however, strain-specific reference assemblies feature different chromosomal coordinates and only a limited extent of annotation. considering these restrictions and requirements, it is advisable to align the data to the reference closest to the strain used in the experiment, and lift over exon coordinates from the well-annotated mm <dig> assembly to the alternative reference, thus achieving a strain-specific, roughly annotated genotyping result. we performed this procedure for sequences of  <dig> enu-mutated lines of c3heb/fej mice aligned to the alternative reference assembly for c3h/hej and annotated by exon lift-over from mm <dig> 

RESULTS
for a direct comparison, we mapped the raw reads from the exome sequencing experiment to both the mm <dig> and the c3h/hej reference sequences. the mapping statistics showed a slight, but consistent improvement of alignment against the c3h/hej reference as compared to the mm <dig> reference: as an example, for the sequencing units for the  <dig> samples of line  <dig>   <dig> % of reads were uniquely mapped to mm9; the error rate was  <dig> % on average for read  <dig> and  <dig> % on average for read  <dig> 

meanwhile,  <dig> % of the reads were uniquely mapped to c3h/hej; the error rate was  <dig> % on average for read  <dig> and  <dig> % on average for read  <dig> 

the hits obtained from exon lift-over using megablast showed an average sequence identity of  <dig> %, the exons on chr <dig> showing the lowest identity  and the exons on chr <dig> and chr <dig> showing the highest identity , as shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> density plot of % sequence identity of the mm <dig> exons on chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  when megablast-ed against the c3h/hej reference sequence.



variant call files annotated with the information obtained from exon lift-over were used for selecting candidate variant positions .figure  <dig> example variant position as annotated in vcf format: the only private, exonic position in line  <dig>  where all  <dig> individuals show an homozygous alternative genotype. annotations from the exon lift-over appear in the info section of the vcf file: eid ensemble exon id, gid ensemble gene id for the exons in eid, gir ensembl gene id for all genes overlapping the position, gnm associated gene names for the exons in eid, gnr associated gene names for all genes overlapping the position.



applying the filtering strategy described under materials and methods, we were able to isolate between  <dig> and  <dig> variant positions per line, including both single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions . these numbers were reduced to between  <dig> and  <dig> positions per line after selecting only positions in exons that did not have any other variant and only positions with enu-type base changes.table  <dig>

in  <dig> of the  <dig> lines, one of these positions could be confirmed by sanger sequencing in at least ten mutant offspring as the underlying mutation responsible for the phenotype. these mutations were not found in wild-type littermates. in  <dig> further lines, at least one of these positions may be related to the phenotype of the line via the described gene function, and validation of the genotype-phenotype relationship is ongoing in these lines. for the remaining  <dig> lines, the detected variants did not affect genes obviously related to the phenotype.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
enu mutagenesis applied to mice aims at generating mutant lines to obtain mouse models for interited human diseases. subsequently, genomic variants are used in database searches to pinpoint candidate genes whose function may be related to the observed phenotype. after unraveling the genomic impact of mutagenesis on the murine phenotype, these mice may serve as model system for comparable human phenotypes.

analysis of these genomic variants starts with the comparison of the sequence of the mutated mouse with a murine reference sequence. this reference sequence, in the case of mouse the assembly by ncbi and the mouse genome sequencing consortium, mm <dig>  <cit> , represents a theoretical consensus sequence of an inbred wild type mouse, integrating sequence information from individuals and different strains. as a consequence, the bulk of the genomic variants observed in the course of such a comparison originates from natural differences between individual mice and mouse strains and the reference rather than from the mutagenesis itself. these variants have to be excluded since they are most likely irrelevant for the phenotype caused by the mutagenesis. in the present study, we were able to successfully filter out most of the strain-specific variation by using a closely related reference genome sequence such as c3h/hej instead of the common mm <dig> one. as a consequence, we obtained more specific mappings and reduced the number of sequence variants due to the evolutionary distance between c3h/hej and mm <dig> 

an important contribution towards the selection of mutated candidate genes was the prior information we had for each of the mutant lines, in particular the mode of inheritance.

linkage information, where available, was an additional factor to restrict the results of the variant analysis to a certain genomic region in  <dig> lines.

since multiple unrelated mutant lines of the same strain background were included in the analysis, the set of the remaining lines served as filter for private variants in each one of the lines. the present set of  <dig> mutant lines shows that increasing the number of individuals from a given line helps to reduce the number of candidate positions complying with the expected genotype.

looking only at a single line, e.g. line  <dig>  and selecting only exonic variants with homozygous variant genotype, we would have found  <dig> positions instead of  <dig> position when using at least one of the other lines with  <dig> individuals  as filter.

similarly, when using at least one of the other lines with  <dig> individuals  as filter, we reduce to a maximum of  <dig> positions for line  <dig> 

only positions with the required genotype in all individuals of the line were kept; thus the number of individuals per line also has an impact on the efficiency of filtering: in lines where  <dig> individuals were available, only  <dig> to  <dig> exonic variants remained after filtering, whereas in lines with only  <dig> individuals, the numbers range from  <dig> to  <dig>  although it might be possible to further improve the filtering by using other sources of annotations, it might not always be practical or necessary. for example, mm <dig> dbsnp positions could be lifted over to c3h/hej by aligning the surrounding sequence, but our tests showed a lower sensitivity and precision than with the exon lift-over.

since enu mutagenesis is typically executed at large scale, yielding tens of phenotypically selected lines, variant analysis of many lines in one batch is expected to yield very selective results, combining the benefits of both setting apart the causative random mutation in a single line from a background population and of having a good number of individuals per line  available for genotyping.

concluding, we have demonstrated that to align the sequencing reads to the available genome reference that is closest to the mouse strain used, in combination with exon lift-over for exon and gene annotation is the most specific direct path to discovering causative variants and novel gene-phenotype associations. we believe the approach described in this paper could be applied by most researchers dealing with mutagenised mice or other organisms with very close non-annotated genome references.
