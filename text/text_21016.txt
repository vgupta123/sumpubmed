BACKGROUND
the epidermal growth factor receptor  is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor  family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that is linked to growth control, cell adhesion, mobility, and apoptosis  <cit> . egfr is an important regulator of epithelial cell biology, but its function in breast tumors is complicated by the observation that its function may vary according to important clinical features like estrogen receptor  and her <dig> status. microarray studies have identified several subtypes of breast cancer arising from at least two different epithelial cell types  <cit> . two of the molecular subtypes of breast cancer are partly defined by the high expression of er, while a third is partly defined by the genomic dna amplification and high expression of her <dig> . the basal-like subtype has low expression of both er and her <dig>  however, most basal-like tumors highly express egfr as assessed by both gene and protein expression  <cit> .

high expression of egfr has been reported in a variety of epithelial tumors  <cit> , leading to the development of drugs directed against this receptor  <cit> . one of these targeting strategies employs monoclonal antibodies  that bind the extracellular ligand-binding domain, while other strategies include small molecule inhibitors  that compete with atp for binding to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain  <cit> . in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines, it has been shown that some small molecule egfr inhibitors increase cell killing when used in combination with chemotherapeutics  <cit> ; therefore, the interactions between egfr inhibitors and cytotoxic agents represent a promising combination for the future treatment of epithelial tumors that are dependent upon egfr-signaling.

the lack of clinical response in breast cancers treated with gefitinib in vivo has been partially attributed to activation of this pathway downstream of egfr, or ineffective methods of identifying those tumors that show an egfr-dependent signature. egf independent activation of the egfr-pathway via the pi3k/akt pathway may occur through either loss of pten or mutation/activation of pi3k, both of which have been linked to gefitinib resistance  <cit> . others have suggested that the mek/erk pathway may play a more important role in resistance to egfr inhibitors  <cit> . recently, moyano et al. identified αb-crystallin  as a protein that can constitutively activate the mek/erk pathway in breast epithelial cells and caused a cell line to become egf independent  <cit> .

in this study, we hypothesized that the breast tumor "intrinsic" subtypes might vary in dependence upon egfr-signaling, which could be reflective of differences in gene expression patterns. therefore, we used breast cell lines to identify an egfr-pathway associated profile and examined interactions between egfr inhibitors and cytotoxic chemotherapeutics in vitro. these analyses identified multiple egfr-associated profiles in vivo that were of prognostic significance, showed important links with tumor subtype, and highlight potential downstream activators of the egfr-ras-mek pathway.

RESULTS
cell line models of breast cancer
breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease arising from at least two distinct epithelial cell populations, therefore, we selected cell lines models of basal-like and luminal cells to begin our investigations of the egfr-pathway. the mcf- <dig> and zr-75- <dig> cell lines were derived from breast tumors of luminal origin and have expression of ck8/ <dig> and er. our previous studies examining cell lines of basal-like origin used immortalized human mammary epithelial cell lines   <cit> ; however, these lines are derived from normal rather than tumor tissue. two er-negative and her2-non-amplified tumor-derived cell lines, sum <dig> and sum <dig>  have been previously shown to express egfr  <cit>  and show basal-like expression profiles  <cit> . the sum <dig> and sum <dig> lines share many characteristics with the basal-like tumors including expression of ck5/ <dig>  therefore, we included these two tumor-derived lines as in vitro models of basal-like breast cancers. by microarray analysis, egfr gene expression was low in the luminal cell lines and higher in the basal-like lines. egfr protein expression by western blot analysis was detectable in the basal-like lines, but not in the luminal lines .

drug sensitivity assays
to assess egfr inhibitor sensitivity, the six cell lines described above were treated for  <dig> h with a range of doses of gefitinib or cetuximab and a mtt assay was used to determine ic <dig> doses . in response to gefitinib, the basal-like tumor-derived cell lines  were two- to 100-fold more sensitive than the luminal lines. the two immortalized hmec lines were 33- and 50-fold more sensitive to gefitinib than the luminal lines, suggesting that the basal-like cell lines as a whole were more sensitive to gefitinib versus the luminal cell lines. cetuximab sensitivity was observed in only a single cell line , with ic <dig> doses for mcf- <dig>  zr-75- <dig>  sum <dig>  me16c <dig>  and hme-cc not achievable even with cetuximab doses as high as  <dig> ug/ml. these cell lines were also treated with inhibitors that affect targets downstream of egfr in the pathway including u <dig>  and ly <dig> . most of the cell lines had a similar level of sensitivity to u <dig> with the exception that sum <dig> was approximately 5-fold more sensitive. ic <dig> doses for ly <dig> were similar for most lines with the exception of me16c and sum <dig> cells, which were approximately 5-fold more resistant than the other lines. the sum <dig> line was the only cell line that was sensitive to all four inhibitors and has previously been shown to be egfr-dependent  <cit> , and thus, was chosen for further analyses of the egfr pathway.

drug combination analyses
given the observation that most biologically targeted drugs like cetuximab typically show low response rates when tested in vivo alone, we examined the effects of chemotherapeutics  as single agents across all cell lines and the combination of cetuximab plus chemotherapeutics in sum <dig> cells. note, we only used the sum <dig> cells for the combination studies because they were the only cell line tested for which an ic <dig> dose for single agent cetuximab could be obtained. we also tested the combined effects of gefitinib, u <dig>  and ly <dig> with chemotherapeutic agents in sum <dig> cells. first, individual drug sensitivity  for each chemotherapeutic was determined for all six cell lines . the relative sensitivities varied across the cell lines and did not appear to correlate with cell type , with the exception that the two basal-like tumor-derived cell lines  were at least three-fold more sensitive to carboplatin, and at least two-fold more resistant to 5-fluorouracil when compared to their immortalized hmec counterparts or the luminal cell lines.

note that the standard errors are presented within ().

as a starting point for combination experiments, we treated sum <dig> cells for  <dig> h with cetuximab and a chemotherapeutic simultaneously. synergistic interactions were not evident in any combination and all combinations were antagonistic as assessed by the method of chou and talalay in calcusyn  <cit>  . we next analyzed the effect of sequential treatment: cells were treated for   <dig> h with cetuximab followed by  <dig> h with chemotherapy,   <dig> h with chemotherapy followed by  <dig> h with cetuximab, or  with cetuximab and chemotherapy simultaneously for  <dig> h. chemotherapy followed by cetuximab was generally more growth inhibitory than cetuximab followed by chemotherapy . the one exception was cetuximab with paclitaxel, where all sequence combinations were antagonistic . however, this antagonism may result from the high sensitivity to paclitaxel already observed in the sum <dig> line . carboplatin followed by cetuximab and the  <dig> h concurrent treatments were synergistic even at low doses of both drugs. 5-fluorouracil followed a similar trend to that of carboplatin, while in the doxorubicin combinations synergy was only evident at doses higher than the ic <dig> dose for doxorubicin first, or the  <dig> h concurrent . similar results were observed for combinations with gefitinib and ly <dig>  where chemotherapy followed by each inhibitor, and the  <dig> h concurrent treatments, were more effective than the biological inhibitor first . synergy was also observed in sum <dig> in addition to sum <dig> for combinations of gefitinib and carboplatin . u <dig>  combinations exhibited different results and chemotherapeutics given first followed by u <dig> were slightly less synergistic than the u <dig> first or concurrent treatment; however, for u <dig>  all combinations except doxorubicin first, or paclitaxel first, were synergistic .

egfr-associated gene expression patterns in vitro
to identify an egfr-pathway associated profile, we analyzed the gene expression data of the sum <dig> cell line treated with egfr inhibitors  and then released from this inhibition to identify those genes that were induced upon removal of the inhibitor. using an unsupervised analysis, we hierarchically clustered all time points from the cetuximab and gefitinib treatment experiments and identified over  <dig> genes that changed in expression at least 4-fold . even though the two egfr inhibitors have different mechanisms of inhibition, sum <dig> cells treated for  <dig> h with gefitinib or cetuximab showed very similar gene expression patterns. intra-class correlation  values between the gefitinib and cetuximab treated samples ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and this level of similarity is evident in the short dendrogram branches from the cluster analysis . the post treatment samples  that represent the reactivation of the egfr-pathway were even more similar . a two-class sam analysis to look for differences between gefitinib-post treatment samples versus cetuximab-post treatment samples identified only  <dig> significantly different genes with a false discovery rate  of 5%; thus, from a transcription standpoint, gefitinib and cetuximab elicited very similar results in sum <dig> cells.

in response to gefitinib and cetuximab, the sum <dig> cell line exhibited decreased expression of many proliferation genes . there was also a large cluster of genes that were induced by the inhibitors, consisting predominately of hypothetical genes with unknown functions. we were more interested in the genes induced after the removal of the inhibitor as this reflects the gene expression patterns associated with the reactivation of the egfr pathway. as early as  <dig> h and  <dig> h after inhibitor removal there was a substantial increase in expression for two ligands of egfr, namely amphiregulin and epiregulin. cyclin a <dig> was also substantially increased . starting at  <dig> h and continuing through  <dig> h and  <dig> h, genes with known roles in g1/s phase such as cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  timeless, and orcl <dig> were increased . by  <dig> h and  <dig> h, dna synthesis and dna damage checkpoint genes were induced . classical gene expression-defined proliferation genes including stk <dig> and cyclin b <dig> were highly induced by  <dig> h . there was also a repression of negative regulators of growth such as growth arrest-specific  <dig> and cyclin g <dig> .

role of mek and pi3k in the in vitro egfr-profile
activation of egfr leads to the downstream activation of other signaling components including the mek/erk and pik3/akt pathways  <cit> . to examine the role of these effectors, we treated the sum <dig> cell line with the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig> and the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> alone, and in combination. microarray time course experiments using inhibitor treated cells followed by inhibitor removal were conducted for u <dig> and ly <dig> similar what was done for the cetuximab and gefitinib experiments. the observed gene expression profiles for the u <dig> and the ly <dig> experiments were similar in both gene identity and direction when compared to the cetuximab/gefitinib profile, but gene expression changes were typically reduced in magnitude. the u <dig> and ly <dig> signatures when compared to each other were very similar at the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points , but diverged at  <dig> h post treatment . the gene expression signatures of ly <dig> and u <dig> samples were also correlated with the gefitinib/cetuximab gene expression patterns at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post treatment . the ly <dig> and u <dig>  <dig> h post treatment samples were less correlated with gefitinib/cetuximab  <dig> h post samples . we also treated cells with ly <dig> and u <dig> simultaneously to determine if the combined treatment would more completely recapitulate the egfr-associated profile; the  <dig> h post combined treatment samples showed a higher correlation value to the gefitinib/cetuximab samples , but still did not account for the entire gene expression pattern of the  <dig> h post cetuximab/gefitinib treatments. these results suggest that the cetuximab/gefitinib profile could not be simply attributed to either the mek or pik <dig> pathway, but that the combination of these two pathways was more representative of the egfr-signature than either pathway alone.

egfr-associated gene expression patterns in vivo
to identify an egfr-associated in vivo signature, a one-class sam analysis was performed using the sum <dig> cells to identify the genes that were statistically induced in the post treatment samples relative to the inhibitor treated samples. adjusting the sam delta value to obtain the largest gene set with less than 5% fdr resulted in a gene list that was extremely large , therefore, the top  <dig> induced genes were selected for further analysis . this gene list was next used to cluster  <dig> unc breast tumor and normal samples representing all five breast tumor subtypes . the list of induced genes from the in vitro sum <dig> experiments were not homogenously expressed across the tumor samples; therefore, to study these multiple expression patterns in the tumors, we defined "clusters" as any gene set that contained a minimum of  <dig> genes and a pearson node correlation greater than  <dig> . using this criteria, we identified three clusters: cluster # <dig> was highly expressed in a mix of breast tumors that contained all five breast cancer subtypes: luminal a, luminal b, basal-like, her2+/er- and normal-like samples ; cluster # <dig> identified a set of tumors that contained 58% of all basal-like tumors, 48% of all her2+/er- tumors and  <dig> luminal b tumors ; cluster # <dig> was highly enriched for luminal a and b tumors, and was also highly expressed in most of the her2+/er- and basal-like tumors that were also high for cluster # <dig> . thus each gene cluster could represent a distinct egfr-associated signature that is enriched in different subsets of tumors . gene ontology  analysis using ease was performed on each gene cluster but only cluster # <dig> had any significant go terms, which were rna processing, metabolism, binding, splicing, and modification . cyclin e <dig> was present within cluster # <dig> and is a known prognostic marker for breast cancer patients  <cit> ; cyclin e <dig> is also associated with basal-like breast cancers  <cit> , which was recapitulated here. lastly, cyclin e <dig> is known to be regulated by egfr-signaling  <cit> , where both akt and erk can inhibit p27kip <dig>  which is a negative regulator of cdk2/cyclin e <dig> complex  <cit> .

to further examine the biological importance of these three egfr-associated gene sets, we individually applied them to a test set of breast tumors  and determine whether they predicted patient outcomes. first, we determined a mean expression value of all genes within each cluster for each patient. next, the patients were rank-ordered according to their mean expression values for each cluster and divided into halves or thirds. kaplan-meier survival analyses for relapse-free survival  and overall survival  were performed and all three clusters were statistically significant predictors of outcomes where high expression always predicted a poor outcome . high expression of clusters # <dig> and # <dig> were also significant predictors of rfs and os in the unc training data set . using a cox regression analysis, we tested each cluster with the standard clinical parameters and determined that the high expression  of cluster # <dig> compared to the lowest expression  significantly predicted a worse outcome for both rfs and os  after controlling for age, er status, size, grade, and node status. since the nki <dig> data set was enriched for node-negative tumors less than  <dig> cm in diameter, tumor size and node status were not significant in the multivariate analysis  <cit> . chi-squared analyses were performed to identify relations between tumor subtypes and clusters #1– <dig>  consistent with observations from figure  <dig>  the basal-like, luminal b, and her2+/er- tumors were associated with the high expression of all three clusters while the luminal a and normal-like samples rarely showed high expression ; in particular, the majority of basal-like tumors were almost all high for cluster # <dig> .

age was a continuous variable grouped in decade years, size was a binary variable , tumor grade  <dig> and  <dig> are relative to grade  <dig>  and node status  was relative to  <dig> positive nodes. expression of the three clusters was averaged, rank ordered, divided into equal thirds; medium and high expression is relative to low expression. significant variables are displayed in bold.

samples were rank ordered into three equal groups and the percentage of each subtype in the highest expression group is reported for the nki patient data set.

analysis of egfr-pathway components relative to expression patterns in vivo
since most of the genes from the in vivo focused egfr-associated signatures were not established members of the her-signaling pathway, we examined the gene expression patterns of many of the known pathway components for their ability to predict patient outcomes, and determined if they showed correlations to any of the egfr-associated profiles. gene expression data for three-fourths of the her family of receptors , some of their ligands , as well as other pathway components including mek <dig>  mek <dig>  pik3ca, pik3r <dig>  cryab, akt1- <dig>  the ras proteins , erk <dig>  erk <dig>  and a kras-amplicon signature , were individually tested for the ability to predict patient outcomes, for correlations with tumor subtype , and for correlations with the egfr-associated expression clusters #1– <dig> . gene expression for individual genes was rank-order and divided into thirds as was done for clusters #1– <dig> previously, and each gene was tested for its ability to predict outcomes in the unc  <dig> and nki  <dig> tumor data sets. no individual gene's expression pattern listed above significantly predicted rfs and os in both the unc and nki data sets.

chi-squared analyses were used to identify associations between the high expression of the individual egfr-activation profiles for each cluster  and the expression of individual genes categorized as high . the % of tumors with the high expression of each cluster and that show the high expression of the individual gene is shown.

bonferroni corrected level of significance α =  <dig> 

associations of genes or clusters with intrinsic subtype were examined using chi-square analysis and many significant associations were identified . for example, high her <dig> expression, as expected, was significantly correlated with the her2+/er- subtype and high er expression was associated with both luminal subtypes . egfr expression was correlated with the basal-like subtype, while high her <dig>  areg, and pik3r <dig> expression was associated with the luminal a subtype. many other associations with the basal-like subtype were also evident that included the high expression of clusters #1– <dig>  tgfa, akt <dig>  cryab, mek <dig>  nras, kras gene and the kras-amplicon signature . other potentially biologically relevant associations included the high expression of clusters # <dig> and # <dig>  hras, mek <dig>  and akt <dig> with the her2+/er- subtype, and high expression of clusters #1– <dig> and hras with the luminal b subtype. even though clusters #1– <dig> were identified using a basal-like tumor derived cell line, associations with luminal and her2+/er- tumors were identified.

we also tested for associations between the high expression of clusters #1– <dig> with the high expression  of each of the above-mentioned genes in both the unc and nki datasets . in both datasets, the high expression of mek <dig> and hras was associated with cluster # <dig>  while the high expression of many other genes correlated with clusters  <dig> and 3; of note was the high expression of the kras-amplicon, hras, nras, and mek <dig> with both clusters # <dig> and # <dig>  and the high expression of egfr with only cluster # <dig>  the association of different genes with the three egfr-associated signatures is likely reflective of the complexity of signaling in this pathway across breast cancers and suggests possible driving molecular mechanisms for each egfr-associated profile.

lastly, a previously described mechanism for activation of the egfr-ras-mek pathway is the somatic mutation of a ras gene, braf, or egfr, which can be relatively frequent events in non-small cell lung carcinomas. we performed sequencing analyses on a subset of the unc breast tumors analyzed by microarray for egfr mutations in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  and for the common mutations in hras, kras and braf. no somatic sequence variants were detected in the  <dig> tumors that were analyzed, which were over sampled for basal-like and her2+/er- tumors.

discussion
the epidermal growth factor receptor family is of tremendous biological and clinical importance for many solid epithelial tumors. in breast cancer patients, the response rate to single agent egfr inhibitors has been low, however, these trials were performed on unselected patient populations  <cit>  and response rates might be improved within biologically selected tumor subsets. the egfr-pathway has become a potential target in the basal-like subtype because at least 50% of basal-like tumors express egfr as assessed by ihc  <cit> . our in vitro analyses show that all basal-like cell lines tested were more sensitive to gefitinib compared to luminal cell lines. only a single cell line  was sensitive to cetuximab when egf was present in the media, which is the condition that best mimics the in vivo environment  <cit> .

given the importance of combination therapies, we evaluated the combination of cetuximab and various chemotherapeutics in sum <dig> cells and observed that the combination of cetuximab and carboplatin was highly synergistic at low doses of each drug. even though the short-term co-treatment of cetuximab and carboplatin was antagonistic, synergism was observed in the long-term co-treatment. carboplatin, as well as other platinum derivatives, may also be good chemotherapeutic agents for basal-like breast cancers due to the implicated function of the brca1-pathway in this subtype because brca <dig> mutation carriers are likely to develop tumors of the basal-like phenotype  <cit> . in our basal-like tumor-derived cell lines, it has been reported that the sum <dig> line has a brca <dig> mutation and sum <dig> line has barely detectable transcript levels of brca <dig>  <cit> . from a mechanistic standpoint, brca <dig> is required for repair of cisplatin induced dna damage by recruiting rad <dig> to the site of damage  <cit>  and brca1-deficient cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin compared to wild type cells  <cit> . the combination of an egfr inhibitor and a platinum drug has also been found to be synergistic in several other cell types  <cit> . in our experiments, we showed that not only are the basal-like tumor derived cell lines the most sensitive to carboplatin and the egfr inhibitors when applied individually, but also that the combination was synergistic. these results provide supportive preclinical evidence for an ongoing clinical trial for "triple-negative/basal-like"  metastatic breast cancer patients who are receiving either cetuximab alone versus cetuximab plus carboplatin  <cit> .

given the biological importance of the egfr pathway in epithelial tumors, we identified an egfr-associated profile in vitro and examined its interplay with other biological features in vivo. in primary breast tumors, the sum102-defined set of egfr-associated genes was broken into three distinct expression patterns , of which the high expression of two predicted poor patient outcomes in both the training and test data sets . the prognostic ability of these clusters was further analyzed in the test set and cluster # <dig> could predict poor outcomes even after controlling for the standard clinical parameters in a cox multivariate analysis. of the three signatures, cluster # <dig> was the only cluster significantly associated with high egfr gene expression.

since most of the egfr-associated in vivo profile genes did not have obvious functions in the her family pathway , we searched for correlations with the expression levels of well known genes in the pathway. many relationships were identified that could have important mechanistic implications . to assist in the interpretation of these complex patterns, we used the program cytoscape  <cit>  to display the gene expression data in a pathway styled format and highlighted the statistically significant associations observed within each subtype . each subtype had a distinct egfr-pathway cartoon relative to both the egfr-associated profiles, as well as the expression of key genes from the egfr-ras-mek pathway. the luminal a subtype showed low expression of most of the genes we examined in the her family pathway, and on average, was low for all three egfr-associated profiles. one of the few genes whose high expression was significantly correlated with this subtype was the her <dig> receptor ; high expression of her <dig> and average expression of two of its ligands  was observed in this tumor subtype that typically shows low grade, slow growth, and an er-rich expression signature.

the luminal b tumors showed moderate to high expression of the egfr-associated profiles, high hras expression, and potentially high mek <dig> expression . the egfr-her <dig> pathway has often been implicated as a potential mechanism for tamoxifen resistance in er+ patients  <cit> . we determined that the high expression of the egfr-associated profiles was able to predict outcome differences in er+ and tamoxifen-treated patients in both the unc and nki data sets ; however, it should be noted that the expression of these clusters in er+ patients closely parallels the distinction of luminal a versus luminal b. these results suggest that part of the luminal a versus luminal b distinction is due to the activation of the egfr/her <dig> pathway in luminal b tumors. in support of this hypothesis, ninety-six percent of the luminal b tumors showed high expression of at least one of the three egfr-associated clusters, whereas only 24% of luminal a tumors had high expression of at least one. our results are also consistent with the hypothesis of the "non-genomic" effects of er to activate the her pathway, where membrane bound er complexes with egfr and/or her <dig> to cause activation of the ras-mek and p <dig> pathways  <cit> , and suggests that these er "non-genomic" effects are occurring in luminal b tumors. response to egfr inhibitors in er-positive tumors have been mixed with some indicating a benefit  <cit> , while others found no benefit  <cit> . a hypothesis that could be tested is that the high expression of one or more of the egfr-associated gene sets in er+ tumors might correlate with response/benefit to egfr inhibitors.

the her2+/er- tumors, as expected, showed statistically high expression of her <dig> and were also associated with high hras and mek1/mek <dig> . high akt <dig> levels were also associated with this tumor subtype, which has been previously identified  <cit> .

the basal-like subtype showed the high expression of each of the three egfr-associated profiles; ninety-one percent of the basal-like tumors had high expression of at least one of the signatures with 58% of the tumors having high expression of all three. high expression of many of the genes in the egfr-ras-mek pathway were also significantly correlated with the basal-like subtype including egfr, tgfα, mek <dig>  mek <dig>  akt <dig>  cryab, nras and the kras-amplicon signature . for many of the genes or clusters examined here, as many as 70% of the basal tumors were in the highest 1/ <dig> expression group when compared to all other tumors. these data, when coupled to the egfr inhibitor studies on breast cells lines, strongly suggest that the egfr-ras-mek pathway plays an important role in the basal-like subtype's biology, and may be a requisite activating event for tumor formation.

the pathway analysis of the basal-like subtype has also potentially provided important mechanistic clues about how the egfr-ras-mek pathway is activated in basal-like tumors. one example concerns cryab, which has previously been shown to be highly expressed in many basal-like tumors and to portend a poor outcome. moyano et al. showed that the ectopic expression of cryab in breast epithelial cells caused them to become transformed and egf-independent through activation of mek  <cit> . this transformed phenotype was reverted by the addition of the mek inhibitors pd <dig> and u <dig>  while the pik <dig> inhibitor ly <dig> had little effect. cryab could also potentially confer resistance to egfr inhibitors as well as chemotherapy by its anti-apoptotic mechanism, which is via the inhibition of caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . other potential activation events include the high expression of hras and kras; in particular, the kras-amplicon signature , was highly expressed in 70% of the basal-like tumors and was shown to correlate with high expression of cluster # <dig>  given that most basal-like tumors showed either high expression of cryab or the kras-amplicon signature , drug targeting of the egfr-ras-mek pathway downstream of egfr  might offer a more effective therapy than targeting of egfr directly.

while these experiments only address gene expression patterns and not the protein levels or phosphorylation status of egfr or ras or mek, we believe it is likely that these signatures are bona fide egfr-pathway activation signatures. the supportive data for this hypothesis includes the in vitro observations that these are genes induced when an egfr-dependent cell line is freed from growth inhibition via egfr inhibitors and the in vivo associations between the high expression of these signatures and genes including hras, kras and egfr itself. regardless of the classical markers of activation of the egfr-ras-mek pathway, the strong associations between these expression profiles and patient outcomes in two different data sets suggest that they are important profiles. currently, we have chosen only to validate our profiles using additional microarray data sets, as opposed to using western blots or quantitative pcr of the training set, since each of these signatures represents a large number of genes/proteins. many of these genes have no current link to the egfr-signaling pathway and we cannot be sure of which genes are driving the prognostic significance of the clusters. if these signatures show additional promise for clinical application, detailed follow up will dissect which genes are important for prognosis, and then they will be confirmed using other platforms. perhaps another utility of these profiles might be the ability to predict response to egfr inhibitors, however, we could not test this hypothesis, as there are currently no large epithelial tumor egfr inhibitor treated microarray data sets available. however, we believe that these signatures could represent a dynamic descriptor of pathway activity compared to egfr protein status alone, which does not predict responsiveness to egfr inhibitors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the egfr pathway is a complex signaling network and differences in gene expression levels of its various components can be observed across the breast cancer subtypes. egfr-associated gene expression profiles derived in vitro were prognostic in two independent breast tumor data sets. using these egfr-associated gene expression profiles, and gene expression levels of known genes within the egfr pathway, we have identified key differences in this pathway across the subtypes. a better understanding of each subtype's egfr signaling pathway will have an impact on identifying and determining treatment as the gene expression signature may more readily be associated with activation of the pathway than egfr status alone.
