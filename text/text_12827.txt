BACKGROUND
plant micrornas  and small interfering rnas  are two major classes of non-coding small rnas with 21– <dig> nucleotides in length that mediate rna silencing pathways to regulate gene expression and innate immune response . however, mirna and sirna are distinct from modes of biogenesis and defense. specifically, mirna is primarily generated from a single-stranded precursor that forms a self-complementary stem and loop structure, whereas sirna is derived from double-stranded rnas or exogenous viruses. in plants, most mirnas are processed specifically by the dicer-like  <dig>  protein, and in contarst, sirnas are cleaved by dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and dcl <dig>  after excision, mature mirnas or sirnas are loaded onto the argonaute  proteins, with other factors to assemble the rna-induced silencing complex , guiding mirna/sirna to pair with specific rna targets to implement the translational repression or silencing . sirna function is primarily to detect and eliminate invading viruses by targeting the virus-derived single strand rna . however, mirnas species usually negatively regulate their target genes via translational inhibition or cleavage of target mrnas and thus play a pivotal role in a wide variety of biological processes such as plant development, signal transduction, resistance pathways, as well as abiotic and biotic stresses . upon viral infection, mirnas often exhibit differential expression profiles . for instance, mirnas in cotton plants are differentially regulated by infection with cotton leafroll dwarf virus  and some clrdv-induced symptoms may be correlated with the deregulation of mirna and/or epigenetic networks  <cit> . in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis, the expression of mir <dig> and ago <dig> mrna is up-regulated in response to infection by several plant viruses . the same also holds true for soybean mosaic virus -infected soybean plants carrying the resistance gene rsv <dig>  <cit> . as ago <dig> protein is a central component of the risc in the mirnas/sirnas-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing  pathways  <cit> , these findings suggest the possible role of mirna in regulating the innate antiviral silencing pathways in plants.

pear is an important fruit tree crop cultivated worldwide. china, the world’s major producer of pears, has distinctive local pear varieties; however, many pear cultivars are commonly infected with apple stem grooving virus  and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus , and viral infection dramatically reduces fruit quality . obtaining virus-free seedlings by heat treatment combined with shoot meristem tip culture is an effective way to control virus diseases in fruit trees  <cit> . in a previous study, we found that viruses were distributed unevenly in in vitro-grown pear shoots, and that the viral titer apparently decreased in the pear shoot apical meristem in response to high temperature treatment  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism underlying the thermotherapy elimination of viruses is not known. to understand the relationship between the high temperature-dependent decrease in viral titer and the mirna pathways in pear shoots, we used in vitro-grown pear shoots infected with asgv, a member of the genus capillovirus  <cit> , as a research material. we sequenced and compared small rnas prepared from p. pyrifolia shoot meristem tip tissue cultured in vitro at 24 °c and at 37 °c, a high temperature treatment. the expression levels of viral genomic rna, mirnas and mrnas of their predicted target genes in the shoot meristem tip and base tissues were analyzed to explore the possible roles of mirna regulation in the high temperature-dependent decrease in virus titer.

RESULTS
analysis of small rnas from in vitro-cultured pear shoots infected with asgv in response to high temperature
to identity mirnas associated with high temperature treatment, small rna differential expression libraries were constructed from 24 °c- and 37 °c-treated in vitro-grown pear shoots infected with asgv and sequenced using high-throughput solexa sequencing. after removing the low quality reads, 5′ primer contaminants, reads without the 3′ primer, reads with no insert tags, reads containing poly a tags, and reads shorter than 18 nt and longer than 30 nt reads, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from the meristem tips of in vitro pear shoots cultured at 24 °c and 37 °c, respectively . the sequenced clean small rnas included different categories of exon antisense and sense, intron antisense and sense, rrna, repeats, trna, snrna, snorna, mirna and other unannotated reads, of which mirna tags accounted for  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  for the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively , indicating that the proportion of mirnas in the 37 °c library was higher than in the 24 °c library.table  <dig> distribution of small rna sequences among the different categories in the 24 °c and 37 °c treatment libraries constructed from in vitro-grown pear shoots



analysis of the length distribution of the small rnas showed that the 21 nt molecules were the most abundant, with  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads  in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively. the next most abundant class was the 24 nt molecules, with  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads  from the the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries . interestingly, among the unique sequences, the 24 nt srna sequences were most abundant, followed by the 23 nt srna sequences, while the 21 nt and 22 nt sequences were present in similar amounts . based on the sizes of mirnas, the most abundant were 21 nt in length, with a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively ; this relative abundance of 21-nt mirnas is similar to results reported previously in p. mume  <cit> . the majority of unique mirna sequences fell in the range of 21–24 nt in length in both libraries , and among them, the 21-nt unique mirnas were most abundant with  <dig> and  <dig> reads, followed by the 24-nt mirnas with  <dig> and  <dig> reads, while 22-nt and 23-nt sequences were present in similar amounts in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively .fig.  <dig> length distribution of small rna reads in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries constructed from in vitro-grown shoots of p. pyrifolia. length distribution of srna reads  and unique sequences  in the two libraries

of the clean reads, the common and specific reads in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries from the in vitro-grown pear plants, including the unique reads and total reads, were calculated . the results showed that  <dig>  % total srnas  with an average sequence mean frequency of  <dig>  were specifically present in the 24 °c library,  <dig>  %  with an average frequency of  <dig>  were found only in the 37 °c library, and  <dig>  %  with an average common sequence frequency of  <dig>  were co-present in both libraries . taken together the above results suggested that there is a huge difference in the number of reads between the 24 °c and 37 °c samples.

characterization of known mirnas in p. pyrifolia
known mirnas in p. pyrifolia were identified by alignment to a designated part of mirbase <dig> . one hundred forty-nine known mirnas in the two p. pyrifolia libraries were obtained and identified after removing mirnas in which the expression levels were too low to be analyzed for differential expression . forty-seven members, belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families, were found in the two p. pyrifolia libraries. the numbers and the read counts for the conserved mirna families were analyzed . a majority of the  <dig> mirna families contained  <dig> members, families mir <dig> and mir <dig> each contained  <dig> members, and the remaining ones including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir399e, mir <dig>  and mir <dig> had only one member each. the most abundant mirna was mir <dig> with  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries from p. pyrifolia, respectively, while mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were moderately abundant. these results showed that the mirna members exhibited significant differential expression levels, in agreenment with findings from other fruit species such as apple and grape  <cit> . in addition to the conserved mirnas,  <dig> non-conserved mirnas were identified, of which mir <dig> was the most abundant with  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively .fig.  <dig> number of mirna members identified in each conserved mirna family in the small rna libraries

identification of novel candidate mirnas in p. pyrifolia
the characteristic hairpin structure of mirna precursors or detection of the corresponding mirnas can be used to identify novel mirnas. beijing genomics institute  company  has developed a prediction software, mireap to predict novel mirnas by exploring the secondary structure using the mfold web server, the dicer cleavage sites, and the minimum free energy of the annotated small rna tags which could be mapped to the pear genome sequence  . a total of  <dig> new mirnas were identified, of which  <dig> and  <dig> mirna candidates were from the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively. after removing those mirnas with expression levels that were too low to be analyzed for differential expression,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified, of which  <dig> were differentially expressed; novel <dig> had the highest abundance with  <dig> transcripts per million , followed by novel <dig> with  <dig> tpm in the 24 °c library. in the 37 °c library, novel <dig> had the highest abundance at  <dig> tpm, followed by novel <dig> and novel <dig> with  <dig> and  <dig> tpm, respectively . the results from this analysis revealed that most of the novel mirnas were present in relatively low abundance, as indicated by their frequencies, in comparison with the conserved mirnas. in addition, among the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig> had complementary mirna*s, with precursor lengths ranging from  <dig> to 349 nt and predicted minimal folding energy  ranging from − <dig>  to − <dig>  kal/mol . this is in agreement with published criteria for novel mirna , and indicates that these candidate mirnas are most likely to be new mirna family members in p. pyrifolia. twenty out of  <dig> new mirna/new family members were 21 nt in length, while four, seven, and one mirna had lengths of  <dig>   <dig>  and 20 nt, respectively . also,  <dig> mirnas without mirna*s detected were identified as candidate mirnas ; these loci, pre-mirna sequences and structures, and reads from deep sequencing were also shown in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the base bias in the first position among the predicted novel mirna candidates showed that the majority of these novel mirna candidates started with a 5′ uridine  as shown in additional file  <dig>  in addition, novel mirna candidate nucleotide bias at each position were also analyzed .table  <dig> mirnas expressed differentially between the 24 °c and 37 °c treatments from in vitro-grown shoots of p. pyrifolia

changes in differential abundance levels of mirnas in response to high temperature in p. pyrifolia
to identify high temperature-responsive mirnas, the normalized expression of mirnas in the two libraries constructed from the 24 °c and 37 °c treatments was compared. the mirnas that showed changes in expression levels > <dig> -fold with p-values less than  <dig>  in response to high temperature treatment in p. pyrifolia infected with asgv were presented in table  <dig>  the results showed that seven known mirna candidates were differentially expressed, while  <dig> potentially new mirna candidates were differentially expressed between the two libraries. three known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were up-regulated, while four known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were down-regulated in response to 37 °c treatment. among the  <dig> differentially expressed potentially novel mirnas/new members,  <dig> novel mirna were expressed specifically in response to 37 °c, while  <dig> novel mirnas were specifically expressed in the 24 °c library .

to validate the existence of the predicted differential expression of mirnas in the pear shoot meristem tip tissue, four known and eight novel mirnas that were differentially expressed in the two libraries were analyzed by poly  real-time quantitative pcr. the pcr primers were listed in additional file  <dig>  gene expression levels were presented as fold-changes in the 37 °c treatment shoots relative to expression in the 24 °c shoots. the results showed that the expression patterns of four known mirnas and eight novel mirnas determined by qrt-pcr were similar to those from the deep sequencing data except for mirna <dig>  novel <dig>  and novel <dig> . results from deep sequencing and real-time pcr demonstrated that 37 °c high temperature-responsive mir397a and mir3627-5p were up-regulated in the shoot meristem tip tissue, while mir477b, novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  and novel <dig> were down-regulated in response to 37 °c treatment .fig.  <dig> relative mirna expression profiles determined in in vitro pear shoot tips in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries by deep sequencing  and quantitative real-time pcr , and in base tissue by qrt-pcr 



to investigate the effect of high temperature on viral titer with respect to mirna pathways in different tissues, the expression levels of mir397a, mir477b, mir3627-5p, mir <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  and novel <dig> were also quantified in the shoot basal tissues treated at 24 °c and 37 °c using qrt-pcr. the results showed that the 37 °c treatment induced 2- <dig> fold increases in mir397a, mir477b, novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  and novel <dig> expression levels in shoot basal tissue. treatment at 37 °c also resulted in a  <dig> -fold decrease in mir <dig> and a  <dig> -fold decrease in novel <dig> expression levels, with no apparent fold-change in novel <dig> . the relative expression levels of four mirnas  changed significantly in both tissues but in opposite directions. two mirnas  changed significantly in the base as compared to the tip . thus, our results show that mirnas in pear shoots cultured in vitro have different expression profiles in the shoot meristem tip as compared to base tissues, indicating that mirnas differentially regulated at high temperature exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns.table  <dig> expression patterns of differentially expressed mirnas and targeted mrna genes analyzed in meristem tip and base tissue of in vitro-grown pear shoots by qrt-pcr and deep sequencing

prediction of potential targets of differentially expressed mirnas in p. pyrifolia
hundreds of putative target genes of differentially expressed mirnas that responded to high temperature treatment in pear were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. our results showed that p. pyrifolia mirna targets encoded not only indispensible transcription factors, but also non-transcription factor proteins involved in diverse physiological processes. to investigate the regulatory function of mirnas in p. pyrifolia infected with asgv, hundreds of potential target genes for four conserved and  <dig> novel differentially-expressed mirnas were predicted by gene ontology  analysis. there are three structured ontologies in go as followings: biological processes, cellular component, and molecular function . in biological processes, the genes were classified into  <dig> categories. the top five over-represented go terms were metabolic process, cellular process, single-organism process, response to stimulus, and signaling. nine cellular components were identified, with the top four being cell, cell part, organelle, and membrane. nine molecular functions were identified, with the most frequent being catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity, and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity. these results indicated that the mirnas have broad functions in gene regulatory networks. in addition, many mirnas may regulate target genes that are involved in disease resistance and defense. for example, the expression of the putative disease resistance protein targeted by novel <dig>  was up-regulated in response to 37 °c treatment by rna-seq analysis . high temperature treatment  specifically induced expression of novel <dig> and novel <dig> mirnas that target a disease resistance rpp13-like protein and disease resistance protein rga2-like, respectively. this indicates that the predicted mirna target genes have important functions in the response to high temperature; however the mechanism behind the mirna-mediated high temperature reduction in viral titer is presently unknown.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  analysis of the predicted targets for the differentially expressed mirnas



the effect of high temperature on asgv in the shoot meristem tip tissue of in vitro-grown p. pyrifolia
to investigate the effects of high temperature on asgv accumulaiton in in vitro-grown p. pyrifolia shoot meristem tip tissues, the asgv genomic rna in the samples treated at 24 °c  and 37 °c  was quantified by real-time pcr to detect the cp gene. it was found that in comparison with the control, asgv was reduced to  <dig> -fold and to  <dig> -fold after 37 °c treatment for  <dig> and 5days, respectively . apparantly, the asgv titer in the meristem tip tissue decreased along with increasing treatment times at high temperature.fig.  <dig> asgv virus titer in tip meristem tissues of in vitro pear shoots determined by qrt-pcr analysis of the asgv cp gene in the 24 °c and 37 °c small rna libraries



spatial expression patterns of potential mirna-mediated target genes in response to high temperature in p. pyrifolia shoots
to examine if high temperature-responsive mirnas can regulate the expression of their target genes, the expression levels of selected mirnas and their target mrnas were analyzed from tip and base tissues of pear shoots. the changes in spatial expression patterns of laccase-4-like, della protein rgl1-like, proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig>  an abc transporter a family member, nac domain-containing protein 72-like, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenate, mitochondrial-like, disease resistance protein rga2-like, e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase upl1-like, and squamosa promoter-binding-like protein13a, as predicted targets of mir397a, mir477b, mir <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  and novel <dig>  respectively, were quantified using qrt-pcr . the correlations between the expression levels of these mirnas and their target mrnas in pear shoot tip and base tissues in response to high temperature were shown in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> mirna target gene expression profiles in the shoot tip  and base tissues  of in vitro-grown pear shoots determined by qrt-pcr



in shoot apices, negative correlations were observed for mir397a, mir477b, mir <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  novel <dig>  and novel <dig> and their corresponding putative target genes, except for novel <dig>  putative target gene della protein rgl1-like , proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig> , abc transporter a family member , nac domain-containing protein 72-like , 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenate, mitochondrial-like , disease resistance protein rga2-like , and squamosa promoter-binding-like protein13a  were all up-regulated with relative quantitive  values of  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the 37 °c treatment, respectively. we also analyzed expression patterns of several mirna-mediated target genes in shoot base tissue. the results showed that the expression levels of target gene laccase-4-like increased at 37 °c, with rq  <dig> . expression of abc transporter a family member and nac domain-containing protein 72-like also increased at 37 °c, with rq values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. mrna levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and squamosa promoter-binding-like protein13a at 37 °c also increased  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively. this shows that the changes in mrna levels in stem base tissue and in shoot tip tissue are different. in addition, the other target genes showed the opposite expression patterns in base tissue compared with tip tissues .

discussion
high-throughput sequencing of p. pyrifolia small rnas
in this study, millions of small rna reads from libraries prepared from asgv-infected p. pyrifolia shoots grown at 24 °c and 37 °c were obtained by high-throughput sequencing. the pear genome sequence, released in  <dig>  was used for annotating the specific mirnas of p. pyrifolia  <cit> . the most abundant small rna reads in the two libraries prepared from the p. pyrifolia samples were 21 nt in length, followed by 24 nt, while 24 nt reads were predominant in the unique small rna reads . this is different from reports in other plant species in which 24 nt srnas are more abundant, such as in the wheat response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress  <cit> . the ratio of srna total reads/unique sequences in the 24-nt class was  <dig>  and  <dig> in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively, while the ratios in the 21-nt class were  <dig> and  <dig> in the 24 °c and 37 °c libraries, respectively. the length distribution patterns of the srna read may refelct the compositions of the small rna sample. for example, mirnas are normally  <dig> or 22 nt long, sirnas are 24 nt, and pirnas are between  <dig> and 30 nt in length. we observed that the 21-nt small rnas increased and the 24-nt small rnas decreased in abundance in response to 37 °c treatment, and the 21 nt mirnas were more abundant in the 37 °c library than in the 24 °c library. these observations demonstrate that the expression of mirnas and sirnas is significantly altered by the high temperature treatment, and such dynamic small rna profiles may have important functions in suppressing viral infection under high temperature treatment.

possible functional roles of mirnas in suppressing viral infection in high temperature-treated p. pyrifolia
in the p. pyrifolia shoot meristem tip, seven known and  <dig> potentially novel mirnas were shown to be differentially expressed in response to high temperature  treatment and the predicted target genes of these differentially expressed mirnas were also identified . these datas provide valuable insight information about the complex mirna-mediated regulatory networks in pear shoot meristem tips infected with asgv in response to high temperature treatment. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of high temperature-altered mirnas that are involved in viral infection.

mirnas may play important roles in host resistance against abiotic stress and biotic pathogens. for example, down-regulation of mir <dig> in a. thaliana up-regulates its target gene csd encoding cu/zn superoxide dismutase, a known enzyme that is related to defense response against pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . in addition, it has also been reported that infections by tobacco mosaic virus and potato virus y lead to changes in mirna expression levels that affect the ability of plants to resist disease. these previous studies have demonstrated that mirnas can regulate key genes in disease resistance pathways to affect viral infections  <cit> . in this study, we identified a number of predicted mirna-target genes from p. pyrifolia that are possibly involved in disease resistance and defense in the high temperature-induced reduction in asgv titers . for instance, laccase targeted by mir397a is involved in the formation of the plant cell wall, and plays an important role in the defense response  <cit> . della protein rgl1-like, tir-nbs-lrr, and rga2-like predicted to be targeted by mirna477b, novel <dig> and novel <dig>  respectively are also known as disease resistance proteins. interestingly, we found that the targets of novel <dig> severely down-regulated in high temperature include nac transcription factor, heat shock factor protein hsf8-like, and e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase cop1-like, which suggests that novel <dig> is involved in a complicated mirna regulatory network. the computational analysis combined with the qrt-pcr results showed that nac is negatively regulated by novel <dig> . numerous members of the nac gene family have been shown to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses which may activate the plant defense response . in this study, we found that significantly repressed expression of novel <dig> significantly up-regulated nac expression in the shoot meristem tip of p. pyrifolia with low asgv titer at 37 °c as compared to 24 °c . in arabidopsis, nac <dig>  regulated by mirna <dig>  is crucial for the formation of boundaries between meristems and emerging organ primordia, and affects auxin metabolism in the auxin signaling pathway . it is possible that up-regulated nac accelerates the growth and developmental process of the shoot meristem tip tissue, and inhibits the moevment of asgv into the newly divided tip cells in an as-yet unknown manner during high temperature, leading to the reduced viral titer in the shoot meristem tip  <cit> . based on above disucssion, it is very likely that the mixed action of these mirna-mediated target genes contributes to the thermo-elimination of asgv in pear. indeed, high temperature can activate many highly conserved biological and adaptive responses that are regulated by mirnas, which exhibit protective functions for the induction of the disease resistance response in plants . future work is aimed at elucidation of the mechanistic details of these mirna-regulated defense genes in inibiting viral infection at high temperature.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of mirnas differentially expressed at 24 °c and 37 °c in the meristem tip of in vitro-grown pear shoots infected with asgv. using illumina high-throughput sequencing, the numbers and types of mirnas were systematically identified from in vitro-grown p. pyrifolia shoot meristem tip tissue at 24 °c and 37 °c. this was done in combination with qrt-pcr to explore the interaction between mirna-regulated pear genes and asgv in response to high temperature treatment. a total of seven known and  <dig> novel mirnas were found to be expressed differentially in response to high temperature. putative target genes were predicted and then annotated by go databases to explore predicted gene functions. comparative analysis of expression levels in relation to virus titer, mirna and mirna-mediated target gene expression patterns were performed to reveal the role of mirna regulation on the decrease in virus titer from the shoot meristem tip observed under conditions of high temperature. our research provided valuable information for further exploration of the function of these mirnas/mrna in associaiton with the reduced viral titer in meristem tip of p. pyrifolia shoots inducible to high temperature treatment.
