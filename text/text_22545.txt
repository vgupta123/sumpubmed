BACKGROUND
5-ht, as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous system, plays a critical role in the control of blood pressure, body temperature, sleep, depression, anxiety, epilepsy  <cit> . additionally, the modulation of the serotonergic system affects long-term potentiation  and long-term depression , the likely neurophysiologic derivates of learning and memory formation, which has been involved in the treatment of alzheimer's disease  <cit> . some studies demonstrate that 5-ht1ar-knockout animals show a deficit in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, such as the hidden platform  version of the morris water maze and the delayed version of the y maze  <cit> , while the stimulation of 5-ht1ar mediates enhancement of ltp  <cit>  and prevents the impairment of learning and memory  <cit> . therefore, the stimulation of 5-ht1ar may be useful in the symptomatic treatment of human memory disturbances. however, accumulated clinical reports support that the injection of 5-ht3r antagonists facilitates the induction of ltp, and enhances the retention and consolidation of memory in hippocampal dependent tasks  <cit> . these clinical application of 5-ht3r antagonists have been found to improve memory in schizophrenic or alzheimer demented patients  <cit> . therefore, 5-ht3r also plays a critical role in cognitive function.

in addition to increasing neuronal excitability  <cit> , inhibition of na+/k+ pump activity can induce ltd whereas depotentiate ltp  <cit> , and then cause impairment of learning and memory and amnesia  <cit> . herein, in the present study, we investigate if a relationship occurs between 5-ht and na+/k+ pump in hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons, which may provide new insights in the mechanisms responsible for the 5-ht-mediated modulation of learning and memory.

RESULTS
5-ht-mediated inhibition of ip in rat hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons
 <dig>  mm str often did not recover completely in hippocampal ca <dig> slices even after prolonged washout in the present study, consistent with the previous study that na+/k+ pump inhibition by str was effectively irreversible  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> μm str did not recover completely in rat ventral midbrain slices  <cit> . therefore, str perfusion was applied one time in one brain slice.

in the present study, ip densities affected by 5-ht  were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf contrast to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf of the control of  <dig>  mm str , demonstrating 5-ht inhibits na+/k+ pump activity in hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons. some studies have reported that 5-ht inhibits na+/k+ pump in t sensory neurons of the leech  <cit>  and kidney  <cit> , then depresses the after-hyperpolarization. however, other studies have showed that 5-ht activates glial na+/k+ pump activity in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus  <cit> . 5-ht stimulated synaptic membrane na+/k+ pump from the rabbit cerebrum, but did not influence the activity of this enzyme in the other brain regions  <cit> . these studies suggested that the regulation of 5-ht-induced na+/k+ pump activity may be attributable to tissue and cell specificity.

furthermore, some studies reported that the application of  <dig> μm 5-ht prevented depotentiation but not ltp induced by high-frequency stimulation, whereas bath application of  <dig> μm 5-ht blocked the induction of tetanus-induced ltp  <cit> , consistent with the previous study that 5-ht  prevented ltp induced by a primed burst in rat hippocampal ca <dig> region  <cit> . accordingly, different concentrations of 5-ht may have different modulation of learning and memory. moreover, the inhibition of na+/k+ pump activity can induce ltd whereas depotentiate ltp  <cit> , and then cause impairment of learning and memory and amnesia  <cit> . herein, in the present study, 5-ht-mediated inhibition of na+/k+ pump activity may disclose novel mechanisms in learning and memory. further studies should be done to explore the mechanism.

5-ht mediated inhibiton of ip via 5-ht3r not 5-ht1ar
to identify the specific 5-htr involved in the regulation of ip, we focused on the 5-ht1ar and 5-ht3r that are abundant in all hippocampal layers and subregions  <cit> . in the present study, "way <dig>  + 5-ht + str" treatment yielded the similar result as "5-ht + str" treatment , i.e., the application of the antagonist for 5-ht1ar had no effect on 5-ht-mediated inhibition of ip, suggesting that 5-ht1ar was not involved in 5-ht-mediated inhibition of ip. some studies have reported that 5-ht1ar mediates enhancement of ltp in hippocampal dentate gyrus  <cit>  and prevents the impairment of learning and memory  <cit> , whereas inhibits ltp in the hippocampal ca <dig> field and visual cortex  <cit> , demonstrating the different effects of 5-ht1ar on synaptic transmission in different tissues. therefore, there still are some arguments about 5-ht1ar-induced-modulation of ltp. in the present study, 5-ht1ar did not antagonize 5-ht-mediated inhibition of ip, demonstrating that na+/k+ pump may be not involved in 5-ht1ar-mediated modulation of memory.

in the presence of ondasetron, a 5-ht3r antagonist, 5-ht-mediated inhibition of ip was blocked from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf , while m-cpbg, a 5-ht3r specific agonist, mimicked the effect of 5-ht on ip . these results show, for the first time, that the inhibition of 5-ht-mediated ip is primarily mediated by 5-ht3r in hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons. on the subcellular level, both presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-ht3r can be found. presynaptic 5-ht3r is involved in mediating or modulating neurotransmitter release. postsynaptic 5-ht3r is preferentially expressed on interneurons  <cit> , and there is also 5-ht3r in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons  <cit> . for example, electrophysiological studies in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal cal region or hippocampal primary cultures showed the activation of 5-ht3r  <cit> . furthermore, 5-ht3r is a unique serotonin receptor as it acts as a ligand-gated ion channel, whereas all the other types of serotonin receptors belong to the g protein-coupled receptor superfamily, which may be the reason of 5-ht3r, rather than 5-ht1ar, is the relevant 5-htr for 5-ht-mediated inhibition of ip in the present study. this still deserves further investigations.

some studies indicate that overexpression of the 5-ht3r in mouse forebrain results in enhanced hippocampal-dependent learning and attention involved in fear conditioning  <cit> , whereas most reports show that 5-ht3r antagonists can facilitate ltp and enhance the retention and consolidation of memory in hippocampal dependent tasks  <cit> . furthermore, the complete abolishment of 5-ht innervation in the hippocampus increases ltp in vivo  <cit> -which would suggest that, on balance, 5-ht may exert a negative influence on ltp via 5-ht3r and then impair learning and memory  <cit> . clinically application of 5-ht3r antagonists have been found to improve memory in schizophrenic or alzheimer demented patients  <cit> . it is, however, not clear whether this effect is specific to ltp, or secondary to other changes.

some studies reported that inhibition of na+/k+ pump activity can induce ltd whereas depotentiate ltp  <cit> , and then cause impairment of learning and memory and amnesia  <cit> . moreover, the initial stationary phase of the ltp was followed by a decrease in na+/k+ pump activity of neurons and an augmentation of na+/k+ pump activity in the glial cells  <cit> . these studies supported that there may be some relationship between na+/k+ pump and ltp. the present results show that 5-ht can suppress ip in hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons via 5-ht3r, consistent with the previous study that 5-ht3r partly mediated the decrease of na+/k+ pump activity induced by cocaine in neuronal-like cells  <cit> , suggesting that inhibition of na+/k+ pump activity may be involved in 5-ht3r-induced modulation of learning and memory. this provides new insights for the possible synaptic role of 5-ht via 5-ht3r in cognitive function and neuronal development through na+/k+ pump, which may be a useful target to benefit these patients with cognitive disorder.

CONCLUSIONS
5-ht inhibits neuronal na+/k+ pump activity via 5-ht3r in hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons, which may disclose novel mechanisms for the function of 5-ht in learning and memory.
