BACKGROUND
astrocytes, once thought to be relatively inert cells, have been shown to play a multitude of roles in the developing, mature, and injured or diseased central nervous system
 <cit> . for instance, astrocytes play key roles in synaptogenesis, maintenance of ion and transmitter levels, metabolic homeostasis, and support of neurons following injury
 <cit> . despite their importance, there still is not complete understanding of the factors necessary for the differentiation of these cells.

within the mature optic nerve, there are  <dig> macroglial cell types: type i and type ii astrocytes and oligodendrocytes
 <cit> . type i astrocytes arise from the pax2-expressing neuroepithelial cells of embryonic optic stalk and a subpopulation of these cells migrate from the optic stalk onto the retinal surface where they associate with the surface vasculature to form the blood/retinal barrier
 <cit> . additional type i astrocytes from this lineage remain in the optic nerve adjacent to the globe within the glial lamina, a network of collagenous beams invested with astrocytes that is analogous to the lamina cribrosa in humans
 <cit> . oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the cns, arise from oligodendrocyte precursor cells that migrate from the ventral diencephalon into the optic nerve via the optic chiasm. oligodendrocyte precursor cells also give rise to type ii astrocytes, at least in vitro, but there are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether this also occurs in vivo <cit> . there is increasing understanding of the secreted external and internal signals necessary for glial cells to develop, including leukemia inhibitory factor , bone morphogenetic proteins , sonic hedgehog  and their intracellular signaling pathways
 <cit> . there is also evidence that epigenetic factors cooperate with signaling in these three pathways
 <cit> . however, little is known about the role that specific epigenetic factors play in the development of optic nerve glia.

epigenetics is the study of factors that change transcriptional activity without changing the sequence of the dna itself. these factors include dna methylation and histone modifications
 <cit> . histones can be modified through post-translational modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation
 <cit> . acetylation of histone tails is regulated by two large families of enzymes: histone acetyl transferases  and histone deacetylases . addition of acetyl groups to the histones offsets the positive charge on histone tails, resulting in relaxation of the chromatin structure, which, in turn, leads to greater accessibility of general and cell-type specific transcription factors to binding elements within the dna
 <cit> . hdacs are typically associated with transcriptional repression, although there are also reports that associate hdac activity with transcriptional activation
 <cit> . further, both hats and hdacs can respectively acetylate and deacetylate non-histone proteins in the cytoplasm, thereby affecting protein expression or function
 <cit> .

whereas hdacs are known to play important roles in glial cell development and in disease states within other regions of the central nervous system, there is no information about hdac expression patterns in developing optic nerve. here, the spatio-temporal expression patterns of methylated histone  <dig> , acetylated histone  <dig> , and the hdacs 1– <dig> and 8– <dig> in the developing murine optic nerve have been determined, focusing on the peripapillary and glial laminar regions. using rt-qpcr and western blot analysis, we established that hdacs 1– <dig> are expressed in optic nerve. double-label immunohistochemistry indicated three patterns among optic nerve glia: 1) primarily nuclear localization , 2) cytoplasmic and nuclear at one or more stages of development  and 3) cytoplasmic at all stages analyzed . this study is a critical first step in identifying hdacs that may be involved in chromatin conformation during optic nerve astrocyte differentiation and will also establish a baseline for normal expression patterns of hdacs to enable comparison with disease states in the optic nerve.

RESULTS
acetylation and methylation in the murine optic nerve
the presence of acetylated  and methylated  histone  <dig>  representing active and repressed chromatin within the genome respectively, was determined using triple-label immunofluorescence on sections through developing mouse optic nerve. three different stages of development were chosen for these studies; embryonic day  <dig> , which is a period when astrocyte precursors are found in the nascent optic nerve, postnatal day  <dig>  when immature astrocytes are found throughout the optic nerve, including the optic nerve head and developing lamina and p <dig> when the glia within the lamina, as well as the optic nerve astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are mature
 <cit> .

sections through the optic nerve head and adjacent optic nerve were triple-labeled with antibodies against sox <dig>  which labels glia in the peripapillary, laminar and optic nerve regions, and antibodies against methylated histone h <dig>  and acetylated histone h <dig>  as markers of closed and open chromatin structure respectively. within the optic nerve in the low magnification image of a triple-stained p <dig> section , sox2-immuno positive  glial cells located within  <dig> microns of the optic globe showed the characteristic elongation across the optic nerve that typifies the laminar region; glial nuclei located beyond the lamina were typically rounded or elongated in parallel to the optic nerve
 <cit> .

within the optic nerve, the majority of sox2+ nuclei were immunopositive for both meh3k <dig> and ach3k <dig>  along the external surface of the optic nerve, the majority of cells were sox <dig>  and meh3k <dig> . within the population of extraocular sox <dig>  cells, ach3k <dig> staining was co-localized with meh3k <dig> in a subset of cells. the sox <dig>  meh3k9+ cells located furthest from the optic nerve head were most likely non-glial cells associated with the outer surface of the optic nerve that were revealed by the oblique angle of the section through the optic nerve.

at higher magnification, the majority of sox2+ nuclei within the developing optic nerve at e <dig>  and within the laminar area at p <dig>  and p <dig>  were co-labeled by antibodies for ach3k <dig> and meh3k <dig>  the nuclei of many of the immature astrocytes at e <dig> were elongated in parallel to the optic nerve, consistent with the migration of astrocyte precursors towards the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer where they will differentiate into retinal astrocytes . as development proceeded, nuclei of sox2+ glial cells located in the optic nerve immediately posterior to the globe manifested the cross-wise elongation characteristic of the developing glial lamina .

mrna expression levels in the murine optic nerve glia
the presence of acetylated and methylated histones in optic nerve nuclei, coupled with published reports that glial cell fate decisions require deacetylation, led us to ask which hdacs might be involved in this process
 <cit> . to determine which members of the large family of hdacs were expressed in the optic nerve, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  was performed on murine optic nerve rna. rt-qpcr clearly indicated that mrnas encoding hdacs 1– <dig> were present at e <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> in the murine optic nerve . each of the hdac expression levels from e <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> were normalized to the geometric mean of β- <dig> microglobulin , signal recognition particle 14kda  and succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit a  and subsequently standardized to e <dig> levels for comparison . four expression level patterns emerged following analysis; 1) very little change in levels from e <dig> to p <dig> , 2) p <dig> and p <dig> levels that decreased relative to e <dig> , p <dig> and p <dig> levels that increased relative to e <dig> , and levels that decreased at p <dig> but increased at p <dig> .

sox <dig> positive cells in the developing murine optic nerve are astrocytes
in order to investigate the nature of sox2+ glial cells within the developing murine optic nerve, sections were double labeled using known markers for astrocytes   and oligodendrocytes  
 <cit> . the majority of sox2+ nuclei in the developing optic nerve at e <dig> , p <dig> , and p <dig>  showed co-localization of sox <dig> and the type i astrocyte marker, pax <dig>  quantification of the cells at all three stages confirmed that a large majority of sox2+ cells co-expressed pax2; at e <dig> 95%  were co-labeled, while 96%  and 88%  were co-labeled at p <dig> and p <dig> respectively . counts of the number of co-expressing cells in the proximal nerve  at e <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> confirm the qualitative analysis of the sections  and are consistent with observations that optic nerve astrocytes primarily populate the nerve at locations comparable to the lamina cribrosa in humans.

to examine the presence of oligodendrocyte precursors within the developing murine optic nerve, double-label immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies that recognize sox <dig> and oligodendrocyte precursor marker nkx <dig> 
 <cit> . for these experiments, we examined two regions for co-expression of sox <dig> and nkx <dig>  at p30: proximal optic nerve  and distal optic nerve . at e <dig>  and p <dig>  no expression of nkx <dig>  was detectable in the proximal or distal optic nerve. at p <dig>  nkx <dig> + cells were not observed in the proximal optic nerve  but were present in the distal optic nerve . quantification of the sox2+ and pax2+ cells revealed that  <dig> % of the cells within the distal end of the optic nerve at p <dig> were nkx <dig> + and all of those cells showed co-localization with sox <dig> . these results are consistent with previous publications showing that oligodendrocyte precursors migrate into the rodent optic nerve postnatally
 <cit> .

patterns of protein localization in the developing optic nerve
to examine the temporal expression patterns and cellular localization of each hdac in the proximal optic nerve, western blot and double-label immunohistochemistry were performed. the specificity of each antibody was tested initially by western blot analysis of proteins isolated from mouse optic nerve . each antibody recognized a single band of the predicted molecular weight. the bands were then quantified by densitometry using β-tubulin as a loading control, and the levels of hdacs at each stage were graphed relative to e <dig> levels. densitometric analysis indicated that the levels of a majority of hdacs were higher at e <dig>  with falling levels at p <dig> and p <dig> . protein levels showed temporal changes in expression corresponding to mrna levels for most of the hdacs. two exceptions to this observation were hdac <dig> and  <dig>  in the case of hdac <dig>  the mrna decreased with developmental stage, whereas the protein levels increased. hdac <dig> rna increased substantially at p <dig>  whereas the protein levels decreased. in addition, because rt-qpcr detected hdac <dig> mrna in the optic nerve, we attempted to analyze hdac <dig> protein expression in these studies. unfortunately, none of the  <dig> antibodies tested were specific by western blot, precluding meaningful analysis of hdac <dig> protein expression.

to determine the cellular distribution of each hdac in the developing optic nerve glia, sections of murine optic nerve and nerve head were double-labeled with sox <dig> and antibodies specific for each hdac. the analysis of hdac immunoreactivity in the optic nerve revealed  <dig> basic patterns: 1) predominantly nuclear, 2) nuclear and cytoplasmic, or 3) cytoplasmic . examples of each of the localization patterns are shown in figures 
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig>  whereas the rest of the localization patterns are included as supplemental figures .

hdacs  <dig> and  <dig> were predominantly nuclear in localization at all timepoints examined . in both cases, there was a high degree of overlap between sox2+ nuclei and hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> immunoreactivity. however, at e <dig>  there were also clearly sox2+ cells at the periphery of the nerve that had little or no hdac <dig> labeling . there were also hdac <dig> and hdac2 + cells present within the optic nerve that were sox2-negative. since sox <dig> is a marker of glial cells, hdac+/sox2-negative cells within the optic nerve itself were presumably endothelial cells or pericytes that are associated with blood vessels within the optic nerve.

hdacs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were predominantly cytoplasmic, but showed nuclear co-labeling with sox <dig> at one or more stages of development . hdac <dig> was co-localized with sox <dig> in nearly all nuclei within the laminar region at e <dig>  but only a few sox2+ nuclei were also hdac3+ at p <dig> and none of the sox2+ nuclei were hdac3+ at p <dig> . hdac <dig>  and hdac  <dig>  were rarely detected sox2+ nuclei at p <dig> and those that were detected were located primarily near the outermost edge of the optic nerve. hdac <dig> was co-localized with sox <dig> in the laminar glia at p <dig> , but was not detected in glia at other timepoints. hdac <dig>  was detected in a few sox2+ nuclei located near the junction between the lamina and the more proximal regions of the optic nerve at p <dig> and p <dig>  there was hdac immunoreactivity in the optic nerve that was not localized to the nuclei and was therefore presumed to be cytoplasmic. given the extensive non-nuclear staining for hdacs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it is possible that some of the apparent co-localization was a result of overlap between their cytoplasmic staining and the nuclear sox <dig> immunoreactivity. however, confocal imaging showed co-localization of sox <dig> and the hdacs in both the x/z and y/z planes supporting at least some nuclear localization.

hdacs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were predominantly cytoplasmic, with little to no nuclear label evident at any stage of development . for hdac <dig>  the apparent double labeling observed in low magnification image  was an artifact that was not supported when examined at higher magnification using confocal imaging.

discussion
summary
to summarize the findings of these studies: 1) hdacs 1– <dig> were expressed in the optic nerve glial cells at all three stages of optic nerve development in the mouse, 2) hdacs  <dig> and  <dig> were predominantly nuclear throughout optic nerve development and glial cell maturation, 3) hdacs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  were predominantly cytoplasmic but showed nuclear localization in at least one stage of optic nerve development, 4) hdacs  <dig>   <dig> and <dig> were predominantly cytoplasmic, with little to no nuclear expression at any time during the developmental stages examined, and 5) nuclei co-labeled for ach3k <dig> and meh3k <dig> were present at similar levels throughout optic nerve development. in interpreting these data, we propose that both acetylation and deacetylation are required for astrocyte development within the optic nerve head and glial lamina. in light of the observation that hdacs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were all co-localized to sox2+ nuclei at some stages of development, these hdacs would be good candidates for further study to determine which interact with nuclear histones to regulate chromatin organization.

our finding that hdac <dig> is predominately nuclear in cells within the optic nerve differs from a recent report showing immunoreactivity for hdac <dig> throughout the optic nerve in the nuclei of resident cells and the cytoplasm of the axons
 <cit> . a major difference between the two studies is the ages of animals analyzed: in our developmental analysis, p <dig> was the latest age analyzed, whereas the other study analyzed expression in  <dig> month old mice. there were also regional differences in the portions of the optic nerve analyzed. in the present study, the area of the optic nerve head and glial lamina was analyzed, whereas in the previous report, the morphology of the nuclei would be more consistent with the non-laminar regions of the optic nerve closer to the optic chiasm. the non-laminar portions of the optic nerve contain the progeny of the oligodendrocyte precursors, whereas the laminar astrocytes are thought to derive from the intrinsic pax <dig> expressing astrocyte precursors
 <cit> . therefore, the differences in hdac <dig> expression could reflect the different lineages of the glial cells present in these distinct regions of the optic nerve. in addition, different antibodies were used, which could contribute to different patterns of immunoreactivity. it remains to be determined if these differences represent age-related or lineage-related changes in distribution of hdac <dig>  interestingly, the patterns of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> in the aging optic nerve appeared similar to that observed at p <dig> in our study, despite the differences in age, location within the optic nerve and in the primary antibodies used.

many of the hdacs also appear to be localized to the cytoplasm in addition to or instead of the nucleus. the nuclear import of hdacs is blocked by post-translational modification or cleavage
 <cit> , therefore, the cytoplasmic localization of some hdacs reflects regulated protein trafficking between cellular compartments. in addition, hdacs have also been shown to deacetylate non-histone proteins resulting in changes in their structural and functional characteristics. for instance, hdac <dig> interacts with cytoplasmic proteins such as tubulin and chaperones such as heat shock proteins , causing changes in the contractile functions of the muscles. similarly, hdac <dig> can deacetylate heat shock protein  <dig>  in the myometrium
 <cit> . hence the cytoplasmic localization of some hdacs may reflect an additional role for hdacs in deacetylation of cytoplasmic proteins during glial differentiation and maturation.

protein levels showed temporal changes in expression that corresponded to mrna levels for most of the hdacs consistent with general regulation at the transcriptional level. two exceptions to this observation were hdacs  <dig> and  <dig>  which showed increased mrna levels at timepoints where protein levels were substantially decreased. many factors can influence the conversion of mrna into proteins including mrna and/or protein half-life, post transcriptional regulation by micro rnas
 <cit> . hdacs are well-known targets of post-translational modifications that can affect their stability and activity, such as proteasome degradation via ubiquitinases or caspase mediated cleavage
 <cit> . the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase siah <dig> interacts directly with hdac <dig> and targets it for ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation
 <cit> . although mechanisms regulating hdac <dig> expression have not been characterized, there are reports of non-congruent changes in mrna and protein levels in the murine brainstem and diencephalon at later stages of postnatal development
 <cit> . interestingly, in at least one study, hdac <dig> mrna was shown to have a much shorter half-life in comparison to the protein, leading differential increases in protein expression relative to mrna levels
 <cit> . together, these findings are consistent with regulation of at least some hdacs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

cells in the developing optic nerve do not appear to be globally acetylated or deacetylated
several studies have concluded that the genome of differentiating neurons is globally acetylated
 <cit> , whereas other studies have proposed that acetylation is the key to the differentiation of oligodendrocytes
 <cit> . in non-neuronal cells including glia, recruitment of hdacs by the re- <dig> silencing transcription factor  to the promoter of neuronal genes is critical to repress these genes and is thought to be essential for the development of glial cells
 <cit> . some of our data is consistent with the idea that deacetylation contributes to differentiation of astrocytes within the optic nerve head and laminar regions of the optic nerve; we found seven of the classic hdacs  are present in the nuclei of sox <dig> positive glia in at least one or more stages during the astrocyte differentiation, consistent with a potential role in chromatin regulation. we did not examine the localization of hdac <dig> due to lack of a sufficiently specific antibody, or expression of the sirtunins, the class iii hdacs. therefore additional hdacs may be expressed in the glial precursors and differentiated cells that are not described in this study.

many of the previous studies have focused on hdacs  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> during differentiation of oligodendrocytes
 <cit> . in contrast, very few studies have studied the role of epigenetics in astrocyte differentiation, but those that have been done appear to have conflicting results. several studies using sirna and morpholino antisense have shown that knocking down hdacs, in particular hdac <dig> and  <dig>  alters differentiation of both oligodendrocytes and neurons, without changing the number of astrocytes
 <cit> . a region-specific role for hdacs has been identified in the telencephalon, inhibition of hdac activity resulted in a bmp mediated decrease in neurogenesis and increase in astrogliogenesis by progenitors arising from the ganglionic eminences of the telencephalon in vivo and in vitro <cit> . further supporting a role in gliogenesis is the discovery that acetylation of histones associated with the stat <dig> binding element in the gfap promoter, a gene expressed typically in mature astrocytes, allows the lif/stat <dig> pathway to upregulate expression of gfap
 <cit> . likewise, microarray analysis of neurosphere culture of forebrain cells treated with trichostatin a  and bmp-  in vitro showed that stat <dig> and phospho-stat <dig>  downstream members of the lif and bmp pathways, were upregulated
 <cit> . however, in the developing cortex in rats, neurogenesis was enhanced by hdac inhibition in vivo, showing that there are regional and possibly lineage-specific differences in the functional contributions of hdac activity to the neuronal/glial switch
 <cit> . some of the disparities in the studies of hdacs and astrocytes may be attributable to the fact that both in vitro and in vivo experiments are being compared. epigenetic factors are regulated by cellular microenvironment and placing the cells in vitro has traditionally been a means of testing the effects of changing microenvironment on the cells. therefore it should not come as surprise that epigenetic factors change when the cells are removed from the “normal” in vivo microenvironment.

the study presented here provides an excellent starting point for investigating the role of histone acetylation and deacetylation in optic nerve development and disease. our data are consistent with contributions by not only hdac <dig> and  <dig>  but other hdacs that have not yet been actively studied. in addition to deacetylation, we also infer that acetylation is an intrinsic component to the differentiation of the laminar astrocytes. this is based on our finding that at all the three stages examined, antibodies specific for acetylated histone  <dig> immunolabeled increasing numbers of cells with increasing intensity across development. whereas the studies herein are consistent with hdacs and hats acting in combination to bring about macroglial differentiation, future studies will examine the roles of various hdacs and hats at the genome level to ascertain their function at specific loci.

interestingly, several studies have reported that systemic inhibition of hdac activity can reduce rgc loss following injuries such as optic nerve crush
 <cit> , ischemia
 <cit>  and in the dba/2j mouse model of pigment dispersion glaucoma
 <cit> . however, an as yet unanswered question is how much of the rescue reflects direct effects on histone acetylation in retinal ganglion cells and how much is attributable to effects on the glial populations in the retina and/or optic nerve. future studies will focus on testing the role of specific hdacs in glial cell development within the optic nerve and retina, as well as investigating potential changes in expression or activity levels in retinal diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study show that all the classical hdacs are present in the astrocytes during different stages of murine optic nerve development. based on the localization pattern, the classical hdacs were placed into one of three different categories; predominantly nuclear, nuclear and cytoplasmic, and predominantly cytoplasmic. seven of the classical hdacs, namely  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were localized to the nuclei of sox <dig> positive glial cells in at least one or more stages of astrocyte differentiation in the murine optic nerve. hdacs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were predominantly cytoplasmic throughout the development of the optic nerve astrocytes. finally, hdac <dig> was found in the optic nerve by rt-qpcr, but an antibody specific for hdac <dig> was not available, hence the expression pattern of hdac <dig> could not be determined. understanding the localization pattern of hdacs during different stages of development of murine optic nerve provides a valuable resource to study the role of epigenetic regulation in the differentiation of the glial cell types, an area that has not been yet fully explored. further, our data also provides an important avenue of future research, for understanding the potential role of epigenetic changes associated with disease processes such as glaucoma and diabetes.
