BACKGROUND
tanacetum l. is a genus of the family asteraceae bercht. & j. presl and includes approximately  <dig> species  <cit> . it is one of the largest genera within the tribe anthemideae cass., together with genera such as artemisia l., achillea l. and anthemis l. commonly known as tansies, tanacetum species are native to many areas of the northern hemisphere, occupying the temperate zones of europe, asia, north africa and north america, but particularly abundant in the mediterranean and irano-turanian regions. although the presence of tanacetum in the southern hemisphere is much less common  <cit> , some species are grown worldwide such as t. parthenium  sch. bip., which can behave as a weed outside its native range.

tanacetum species are mostly perennial herbs, although the genus has some annuals and some subshrubs. they usually form rhizomes and are aromatic plants. their capitula, solitary or arranged in more or less dense or loose compound inflorescences, always contain disc flowers , sometimes with ray flowers . tanacetum is considered to hold a crucial position for understanding the phylogenetic relationships within its tribe, but available phylogenetic reconstructions show that these species form an imbroglio whose generic relationships and infrageneric arrangement are still unsettled  <cit> . many species of tanacetum are widely distributed and are used as sources of medicines, food or forage. in particular, several studies have shown that essential oils from t. parthenium  and t. balsamita l.  have strong antibacterial, cytotoxic, neuroprotective and antioxidant activity. t. balsamita has also shown anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . west and central asia are two important speciation centres of the genus  <cit> , and iran is one of the main areas of speciation and diversification, promoted by a unique combination of ecosystems. in iran the genus is represented by  <dig> species according to the most recent revisions, including  <dig> endemic taxa .

the karyology of tanacetum has been extensively studied, with chromosome counts known for a considerable number of its species . its basic chromosome number is x =  <dig>  as in most anthemideae and asteraceae; indeed x =  <dig> is likely the ancestral basic number for the family as a whole  <cit> . ploidy levels are found up to 10×  <cit> . recent work has added more karyological information for this genus; it seems that polyploidy is an important evolutionary force and the existence of odd ploidy, aneuploidy and presence of b-chromosomes is not uncommon  <cit> .

methods such as fluorochrome banding and fluorescent in situ hybridisation  of 5s and 18s- <dig> s-26s  ribosomal rna genes  provide chromosome markers, excellent tools to improve karyotype description  <cit> . these methods have proven useful for comparing taxa at different levels, particularly in plants . however broader cytogenetic information is largely missing for tanacetum, as happens for many wild species, unlike crops or other economically interesting plants whose chromosomes have been more deeply investigated. genome size estimation, easily obtained by flow cytometry, has been used in a similar way . the combination of these methods can improve our understanding of chromosome evolution and genome organisation processes in plants  <cit> . moreover, molecular cytogenetic studies, together with genome size evaluation, are also useful in a wide range of biological fields, from taxonomy, evaluation and conservation of genetic resources, to plant breading .

despite being a large and well-known genus, molecular cytogenetic studies of tanacetum are limited to a single work reporting data on two species: t. achilleifolium  sch. bip. and t. parthenium  <cit> . that study described co-localisation of both 5s and 35s ribosomal rna genes in tanacetum, the so-called linked type  arrangement of rdna, confirming preliminary findings for this genus  <cit> . this rdna organisation is typical of several asteraceae members, particularly those belonging to tribes anthemideae and the heliantheae cass. alliance . however, the most common rdna organisation in plants, and also in family asteraceae, is that in which both rrna genes are separated . remarkably,  <cit>  found that one 35s rdna locus was separated in t. achilleifolium, while the other one remained co-localised with the 5s. this dual organisation of rdna in the same species  is exceptional.

likewise, genome sizes for tanacetum are only known for few species, reduced to three research works to our knowledge . in this study, we establish a deeper knowledge of tanacetum genomes through molecular cytogenetic and genome size analysis. we focus on several species native to iran, since this area constitutes a centre of speciation and diversification of the genus. all ploidy levels previously reported for the genus  exist in iran  <cit> , many of the studied tansies grow there in polyploid series, and odd stable ploidy, aneuploidy and presence of b-chromosomes have been found  <cit> . our specific goals were  to characterise the genomes of tanacetum species by flow cytometry, fluorochrome banding and fish of rrna genes, and particularly, to observe the rdna organisation in these species,  to detect the karyotype and genome size patterns of the genus and describe their typical models, if any,  to address the presence of polymorphisms at the cytogenetic level,  to assess the impact of polyploidy in tanacetum genomes, and  to reconstruct ancestral character states of genome size and karyotype features such as number of rdna loci and cma+ bands to infer genome evolution in the context of a phylogenetic framework of the genus.

RESULTS
the chromosome counts here represent most ploidy levels found in tanacetum to present, all x = 9-based. we found b-chromosomes in one of the populations of t. pinnatum and in t. fisherae, and some of the populations investigated, such as those of t. archibaldii and t. aureum  greuter, m.v.agab. & wagenitz, presented mixed ploidy. in addition, several of the studied taxa are odd polyploids, such as the case of triploid t. joharchii sonboli & kaz. osaloo and t. kotschyi  grierson, and the pentaploid t. fisherae aitch. & hemsl. which is also a hypoaneuploid since it has lost one chromosome out of the  <dig> expected. more detailed karyological information is in table  <dig> table  <dig> provenance and voucher number from the medicinal plants and drug research institute herbarium , shahid beheshti university  of the populations of tanacetum studied, together with genome size, number of cma+ bands and number of rdna sites

we found intraspecific genome size differences in most cases in which several populations were assessed, reaching  <dig>  % in the triploid t. kotschyi,  <dig>  % in the diploid t. parthenium,  <dig>  % in the tetraploid populations of t. aureum,  <dig>  % in the tetraploid t. polycephalum sch. bip.,  <dig>  % in the hexaploid t. tabrisianum  sons. & takht., and negligible variability  among diploid t. pinnatum populations.

genome size  and total karyotype length  were significantly  and positively correlated with ploidy, but monoploid genome size  did not decrease with ploidy. nevertheless, when data of the same species at different ploidy levels was compared, there was a trend to genome downsizing i.e. reduction of monoploid genome size in t. polycephalum and t. pinnatum, whose 4× and 6× polyploids present, respectively,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % less genome size than expected from the genome size in their diploid populations. in addition, genome size is positively correlated with tkl , with the number of rdna signals  and with pollen morphometric characters such as polar axis  and equatorial diameter . species with different compound inflorescences have significantly different genome sizes ; species with solitary capitula have the smallest genome compared to species presenting corymbs of capitula, which have the greatest amounts of dna .

several taxa of different ploidy  farsa, t. parthenium, t. polycephalum sch. bip. subsp. argyrophyllum  podlech, t. pinnatum, t. sonbolii mozaff. and t. tabrisianum) show odd numbers of bands in different individuals . intensity and size differences of chromomycin signals are clearly visible in several species, such as t. kotschyi , t. oligocephalum  sch. bip. , t. balsamita  and t. joharchii .

there is no significant relationship between ploidy and the most commonly found number of signals for a given species, nor with genome size. in addition, the number of gc-rich bands is positively correlated with the altitude at which species occur, considering all taxa  and only diploids .

rdna loci
the fish assays of a large sample representing genus tanacetum show a totally homogeneous l-type organisation of ribosomal rna genes. the number of signals within a species  and between species at the same ploidy is usually heterogeneous although not as heterogeneous as the number of cma+ bands. the minimum number of signals found was two  for one population of t. parthenium and the maximum was  <dig>  for some individuals of one population of t. tabrisianum . in all cases, rdna signals occupied terminal or subterminal positions, always coincidental with cma+ signals, and sometimes appearing as decondensed . species such as t. fisherae and t. tabrisianum , presented locus size differences, but in general, this was homogeneous. the number of rdna signals was positively and significantly correlated with ploidy and genome size , but there was no reduction in number of loci, as the number of signals per haploid genome did not diminish significantly with increasing ploidy. however, a reduction in the number of signals was detected in individual polyploid series for t. pinnatum and three out of four of t. polycephalum. in all other cases there was additivity; that is, the tetraploid had exactly twice as many signals as the diploid, except in the case of one tetraploid t. polycephalum population, in which there was upsizing by one locus.

the heterogeneity in the number of signals for a given species  was positively correlated with ploidy  which means that with increasing ploidy there was a tendency to instability in the number of rdna signals. in particular, the hypoaneuploid t. fisherae  and t. polycephalum var. argyrophyllum  were the most unstable with respect to the number of rdna signals.

phylogenetic relationships among species and ancestral characters
statistical analyses at the genus level should consider phylogenetic relationships among taxa to be as unbiased as possible. however, due to lack of enough data, these comparisons could not be done in most cases. still, we detected significant and positive correlations using the phylogenetic generalised least squares method  between genome size , ploidy, and number of rdna signals , i.e. all parameters increase/decrease in concert. the reconstruction of character evolution into the phylogeny , based on diploid taxa, provides ancestral 2c values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  pg, from  <dig> to  <dig> for cma+ bands, and from  <dig> to  <dig> rdna signals for tanacetum species.fig.  <dig> ancestral state reconstruction of number of rdna signals  and genome size  for diploid tanacetum taxa. the model of reconstruction was parsimony as implemented in mesquite , and ancestral state reconstruction was estimated using the  <dig> % majority-rule consensus topology obtained by bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer  <dig> , its <dig> and trnh-psba data sequence. the bayesian clade-credibility values  are given above branches. schematic representation of chromosomes with the most commonly found numbers of rdna signals and bars that depict genome sizes  with a red line indicating the mean 2c value at the diploid level.  tanacetum polycephalum ssp. argyrophyllum




discussion
all species investigated present x =  <dig> as the basic chromosome number confirming previous research  <cit> . in contrast to other anthemideae, in which other basic chromosome numbers have been found  x =  <dig> it is the only found in tanacetum until present  <cit> .

to our knowledge, genome size was available for only four species of the genus, the diploid t. vulgare , a tetraploid population of t. cinerariifolium  sch. bip.  and some hexaploid populations of t. balsamita and t. corymbosum  sch. bip. . therefore this research contributes new genome sizes for all species and subspecies studied here , representing approximately  <dig> % of the recognised species of the genus. the amount of nuclear dna is mostly intermediate in tanacetum. according to the genome size categories in plants established by  <cit> , three of the  <dig> species we studied  have small genome sizes , whereas the remaining have intermediate genome sizes , including all ploidy levels. mean genome size of the diploid taxa studied  was coincidental with the mean of the tribe anthemideae  and of the family asteraceae , according to data from the genome size in asteraceae database . closely related diploid genera, such as artemisia, have similar mean genome sizes  whereas the majority of diploid tanacetum allies present remarkably lower mean 2c values . the comparatively larger mean genome size of tanacetum could be because our sample lacks annual representatives  which, quite often — though not always — tend to present lower genome sizes than their counterparts  <cit> .

genome downsizing and polyploidy in tanacetum
polyploidy and hybridisation are important evolutionary forces shaping plant genomes and underlying the huge angiosperm diversity. both can confer evolutionary advantages  attributed to the plasticity of plant genomes and to increased genetic variability, generating individuals capable of exploiting new niches  <cit> . polyploidy is linked to numerous epigenetic/genomic changes such as chromosome rearrangements, transposable element mobilisation, gene silencing or genome downsizing . certainly, genome downsizing would be a widespread biological response to polyploidisation  <cit> . this may lead to diploidisation of the polyploid genome . there is no evidence of genome downsizing across tanacetum ploidy levels. however, there are genome size trends within separately polyploid series of particular species. tetraploid t. pinnatum presents up to  <dig>  % lower 1cx than expected from the 1cx of the diploid populations, and hexaploid and tetraploid t. polycephalum present, respectively,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % lower 1cx than expected from the 1cx of the diploid population. this is consistent with previous observations of more pronounced genome downsizing with higher ploidy . recent work  <cit>  has demonstrated erosion of low copy-number repetitive dna in allopolyploids, sometimes counteracted by expansion of a few repeat types. age and genomic similarity of the parental genome donors of the polyploids play a role in the extent of genome size change with polyploidy  <cit>  and a deeper understanding of the likely hybridogenic origin of some of the tanacetum polyploids studied would allow more robust hypotheses on the balancing genomic processes these taxa may have undergone.

small genome size and invasiveness
tanacetum parthenium appears listed in several countries as an invasive weed  <cit> . its genome size was the smallest obtained in our study . this is consistent with previous findings  <cit> , which detected that many weeds  had smaller amounts of dna than closely related  species. this relationship is supported by recent work  <cit> . the other species with small genome sizes in our sample  have not, however, been recorded as weeds. therefore a small genome size  is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a plant to become a weed. a recent review  <cit>  concluded that invasive species were characterised by small and very small genomes, yet this conclusion may be biased by the general trend of land plants to small genome sizes as a whole  <cit> .

intraspecific instability and massive amplification of gc-rich dna occur in several tanacetum species
we found that ribosomal dna is always cma+ in tanacetum , common to other studies  <cit>  although exceptions are found  <cit> . for most of the studied populations, the number of cma+ bands significantly exceeded that of rdna signals and there was no apparent relationship with ploidy or with genome size . the number of cma+ bands is neither stable within a species nor within a population. the presence of odd and of non-homologous signals was occasionally observed, for example in t. aureum and in t. oligocephalum , where a single chromosome with two cma+ bands at each end was observed instead of the two identical chromosomes expected. odd ploidy species, such as t. fisherae  and t. kotschyi , were particularly labile with respect to the number of cma+ bands. however, the greatest variability in number of cma+ bands corresponded to the diploid t. balsamita, in which sevendifferent numbers of signals were found . such instability in the number of gc-rich bands was unexpected and has seldom been reported. only the highly variable cma+ banding pattern previously found in citrus l. and close genera  <cit>  is similar to the variability found in tanacetum, probably as a consequence of amplification or reduction in satellite sequences known to be particularly gc-rich  <cit> . it is possible that some as yet undescribed satellite dna type, specific to tanacetum, is in part responsible for these karyotype features.

another characteristic of the cma+ banding pattern in tanacetum was the striking number of signals found in certain species, particularly in diploid taxa . this contrasts with previous work on genus artemisia  <cit> , in which a large number of cma+ bands was only detected in some polyploids, while the only cma+ bands in diploids were those exactly corresponding to rdna loci. in other asteraceae genera, such as cheirolophus cass., a large number of cma+ bands was also reported, mostly coincidental with 35s rdna signals  <cit> ; this was also the case for filifolium  <cit> . in centaurea l.  <cit>  the number of cma+ bands was the same as or smaller than the number of 35s rdna signals, while in some xeranthemum l.  <cit> , galinsoga ruiz & pav. and chaptalia vent.  <cit> , few additional gc-rich bands were observed.

while most bands are in terminal position, pericentromeric gc-rich heterochromatin was detected in several species, some of them closely related, such as t. polycephalum, t. aureum and t. canescens dc. on one hand , and t. fisherae , t. kotschyi , t. tenuisectum sch.bip. and t. joharchii  on the other. in fact, in arabidopsis thaliana  heynh., centromeres are one of the most gc-rich genomic regions  <cit> . differences in total gc% among eukaryotes are largely driven by the composition of non-coding dna of which retrotransposons are the most abundant . possibly, some centromere-specific ltr could have undergone amplification in these closely related tanacetum genomes.

what can this fluctuating distribution of cma+ bands mean, and what are the implications? it is feasible that a specific satellite and/or retroelement family may be expanded or contracted in tanacetum genomes. although the number and the distribution of cma+ bands are thought to be relatively constant features of plant karyotypes  <cit> , our results strongly argue against this view, since variability was found even within a population. in addition, there were few evident ecological or geographic patterns in tanacetum, that is, few significant relationships were found between the number or variability of gc-rich signals and geographical distribution, weedy behaviour, or soil features. the only significant association is with altitude: tanacetum species living at higher altitudes tend to present more gc-rich dna. in line with this hypothesis,  <cit>  found a large number of heterochromatic bands  in species from the asteraceae genus myopordon boiss. inhabiting high mountain areas. these authors related the development of such heterochromatic bands in terminal regions with an adaptation to protect telomere function from uv radiation, a major genome-damaging agent, particularly in high mountains. heterochromatin expansion in terminal regions  has also been suggested to enhance chromosomal pairing during cell division  <cit> .

genomic organisation of rdna and typical distribution pattern of tanacetum
our cytogenetic study confirmed that both the 5s and the 35s rrna genes are co-localised  in all chromosomes. such organisation was found in artemisia for the first time in higher plants  <cit> , and subsequently inferred for at least  <dig> % of asteraceae species  <cit> . in the latter study, southern blot hybridisation was performed on a sample of t. parthenium, and the profile obtained also suggested l-type organisation for its rdna. prior to our study, the only evidence of this particular rdna organisation directly in chromosomes was from t. achilleifolium and t. parthenium  <cit> . curiously, these authors found one unlinked 5s locus additional to two regular l-type loci in t. achilleifolium, while t. parthenium showed l-type arrangement in all loci. within the sample studied we could not find a single species with unhomogenised rdna , since both rdna probes invariably overlapped in all loci. nevertheless, possible incomplete homogenisation of rrna genes may also be present in other close genera such as achillea and chrysanthemum l.  <cit> . besides, in some metaphases decondensed rdna signals are detected. these probably correspond to active nucleolar organizer regions , i.e. rdna that is being actively transcribed, visible in t. balsamita  and in t. joharchi . decondensed rdna, however, is not always detected during metaphase.

unexpected variation in number of rdna loci
the number of rdna signals was always smaller and less variable than that of cma+ bands, as found previously in other closely related species  and even in other families . in particular, the most common number of rdna loci at the diploid  and tetraploid  levels was relatively constant and consistent with previous data for tanacetum  <cit>  or for the closely related genera matricaria and tripleurospermum  <cit> . however, taxa with odd, higher ploidy or aneuploid levels often displayed higher intraspecific polymorphism in the number of signals. of these, the hypoaneuploid population of t. polycephalum var. argyrophyllum was particularly striking, since metaphases with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rdna signals were observed; the hypoaneuploid t. fisherae  showed a similar condition . thus, processes of hypoaneuploidy could affect genomic stability producing this variation in number of loci.

although it would be expected that the number of signals remain relatively constant for a given species, cases of intraspecific polymorphism in the number of signals are increasingly reported. as for tanacetum, diversity in the number of rdna signals for a given species has been found in fragaria vesca l.  <cit>  and in phaseolus vulgaris l.  <cit> , for example. however, what is exceptional in tanacetum is that these polymorphisms happen even at the population level and, albeit very rarely, sometimes within the same individual. all this, together with the unexceptional situation of odd numbers of signals in many taxa  illustrates how dynamic tanacetum genomes are.

given these fluctuations, the constantly terminal position of rdna signals in all the species studied could be considered surprising. however, this is so in most plants:  <cit>  argued that there seems to be a strong positive selection favouring the location of 35s rdna at chromosome ends, probably as a result of homologous recombination constraints.

as with the number of cma+ bands, there was no global reduction in the number of signals per haploid genome with increasing ploidy. similarly, the number of rdna loci did not show any apparent relationship with genome size.

our analyses have allowed us to distinguish some interesting relationships between several of the traits studied. as others have found  <cit>  morphological data regarding pollen size are tightly linked with genome size in tanacetum, i.e. pollen size reflects genome size in this genus. in addition, species of tanacetum with solitary capitula have smaller genome sizes than those with capitula organised in complex inflorescences. it is known that sometimes polyploids tend to present larger reproductive organs and more flowers per inflorescence than their diploid relatives  <cit> , but few studies have approached the relationship of genome size or polyploidy with natural patterns, such as inflorescence architecture  <cit> . suggested that the shift in inflorescence phyllotaxis from spiral to distichous would have occurred at the same time as the expansion of genome size characterising several groups of grasses  <cit> , though admitting no clear reason why genome size as such should affect inflorescence architecture.

in addition, the reconstruction of ancestral cytogenetic traits brings evidence that these characters have followed increases and decreases during evolution in tanacetum . in general, it seems that genome size and the number of rdna loci have increased, while the number of cma+ bands has decreased in most present taxa. few studies have specifically approached the evolution of cytogenetic traits within a temporal and phylogenetic perspective and, while events favouring increase in genome size and number of rdna signals during evolution have been detected  <cit> , there is no discernible pattern in the direction of these changes. for example,  <cit>  found a decrease in number of rdna loci during the evolution of hypochaeris l. the overall decrease of gc-rich dna could also respond to depletion of certain repeated dna sequences during evolution in tanacetum.

CONCLUSIONS
this work is the first extensive cytogenetic report on tanacetum species. we have confirmed linkage of both rdnas in all chromosomal loci. tanacetum stands out as variable, particularly in the number of rdna sites and cma+ bands. these vary widely even within a given population. in particular, aneuploid and odd ploidy taxa appear more unstable. the observed intrapopulation differences are likely a reflection of genomic differentiation which could complement further population biology studies. besides, the number of gc-rich dna bands found in certain species is striking and deserves more study. a possible cause is the amplification of repeat families or tes in these species compared to others showing utterly different profiles. polyploidy and aneuploidy are important evolutionary forces in this genus. several of the studied populations present spontaneous mixed ploidy, another sign of its current genomic dynamism.

it is difficult to set general patterns in the evolution of genome size, number of rdna loci or heterochromatin in plants. yet, studies such as ours contribute to the knowledge of these cytogenetic features at a larger scale. finally, the particularly labile cytogenetic scenario observed in tanacetum is uncommon and has been seldom reported. both chromosomal markers  tend to be relatively constant at the species level, a feature that has allowed their use in biosystematics. still, even at the population level, these traits can be variable in tanacetum and this variation is better understood considering evolutionary relationships between species.
