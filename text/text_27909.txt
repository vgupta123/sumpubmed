BACKGROUND
grapevine is the most economically important fruit crop in the world, with its berries both eaten fresh and used for making wine, jam, juice, jelly, raisins and vinegar. viticultural production is famously sensitive to climate  <cit> , and temperature and moisture regimes are among the primary elements of grape terroir  <cit> . in many production regions, the maximum midday air temperature may exceed 40°c, with some regions exceeding 45°c  <cit> . high temperatures influence the development of plants and inhibit leaf photosynthesis. exposure to high temperatures during flowering significantly inhibits berry set  <cit> . after fruit set, high temperatures are generally not favourable to the development secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds  <cit>  and aromatic volatiles  <cit> . high temperatures stimulate sugar accumulation  <cit> , resulting in the production of wines with higher alcohol concentrations. to cope with heat stress, it is necessary to breed new cultivars with strong heat tolerance and to design effective physiological defenses against heat stress. consequently, developing an effective and convenient method for evaluating the heat stress is a key goal.

at high temperatures, cell injury and even death may occur, which may be attributed to a catastrophic collapse of cellular organization  <cit> . several physiological traits have been investigated as indicators of heat injury: gas exchange parameters of photosynthesis, including net photosynthesis rate, photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates and stomatal conductance  <cit> ; membrane thermostability, including electrolyte leakage and the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive-substances   <cit> ; chlorophyll content  <cit> . however, these methods all have disadvantages, including insensitivity, inconvenience in field studies and the delay of information between the initial damage and the measurable effect. at present, a rapid, sensitive and convenient method of investigating heat injury for evaluating heat tolerance in grapevine must be developed.

the cell membrane is thought to be a site of primary physiological injury by heat stress  <cit> . the injury inflicted on leaf tissues under high stress weakens the cell membrane, which leads to a leakage of electrolyte out of the cell. thus, measuring electrolyte leakage is a common evaluation method for heat injury. photosynthesis, which is the basis of yield and quality and has long been recognized as one of the most heat-sensitive processes in plants  <cit> , depends on the thylakoid membrane. however, it is difficult to evaluate the heat injury for a large number of plants by measuring the net photosynthesis rate with a photosynthesis system  or the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates with an oxygen electrode system due to the time required per plant. three major heat-sensitive sites occur in the photosynthetic apparatus or process: the photosystems, mainly photosystem ii , and the atp-generating and carbon assimilation processes  <cit> . inactivation of psii by heat stress is related to damage of the donor side, the reaction center and the acceptor side of the photosystem’s electronic transport chain  <cit> . the inhibition of psii leads to a change in variable chlorophyll a fluorescence, and in vivo chlorophyll may be used to detect changes in the photosynthetic apparatus  <cit> . strasser et al.  <cit>  developed a method  for the analysis of the kinetics of fast fluorescence increases, using nondestructive measurements that can be taken with a high resolution of 10 μs. all oxygenic photosynthetic materials investigated to date have shown a polyphasic increase in fluorescence consisting of a sequence of phases, denoted as o, j, i and p. therefore, the measurement of this chlorophyll a fluorescence transient is also called the ojip test. the ojip test has become a powerful tool for the in vivo investigation of psii functioning, including its energy absorption, trapping and electron transport  <cit> . in crops such as wheat, cabbage and raspberry, the ojip test has been applied in the investigation of heat injury  <cit> . however, no complete comparison study has yet been conducted between the ojip test and traditional methods such as the measurement of electrolyte leakage and photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates, and no information exists on the use of ojip parameters for identifying heat tolerance in grapevine germplasm.

the aims of this study were as follow:  to establish a heat stress protocol for grapevine;  to determine which method among the ojip test, the measurement of photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates and electrolyte leakage was superior for assessing the heat injury of grapevines; and  to evaluate the heat tolerance of  <dig> grapevine species or cultivars through determining heat injury by the best method.

RESULTS
the critical temperature  for the investigation of heat injury of grapevines
for investigating the heat injury of grapevines, a critical temperature  was first established. according to weng and lai  <cit> , tc may be determined from the intersection of the two regression lines extrapolated from the slow- and fast-rising portions of the temperature-dependent fo and fv/fm responses obtained from the ojip test . as shown in figure  <dig>  fo and fv/fm responded differently to a gradual increase of temperature in the leaves of ‘jingxiu’, ‘riesling’ and spine grape. these values remained relatively stable below a critical temperature, then started to increase  or decrease  sharply. little difference was observed in the critical values of ‘jingxiu’, ‘riesling’ and spine grape: all were approximately 47°c based on the fv/fm  and fo  values. therefore, 47°c was selected as the tc for evaluating the heat injury of grapevines.

the comparison of investigation methods for heat injury of grapevines under tc
the electrolyte leakage, photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate and ojip test have all been used to evaluate the heat tolerance of plants  <cit> . we further compared the characteristics of the above methods using the responses of leaf discs from ‘jinxiu’, ‘riesling’ and spine grape to heat stress at tc over 50 min. in the ojip test, we chose parameter fv/fm to investigate heat injury. in the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate and electrolyte leakage methods, the o <dig> evolution rate and relative injury index   were used as investigation parameters, respectively. following heat stress at tc, the fv/fm and o <dig> evolution rate values of the three grapevines gradually declined, while their rii values increased . however, the sensitivity to heat stress varied among the three cultivars. significant differences in fv/fm were observed among the three cultivars until after 20 min of heat stress, and significant differences in o <dig> evolution rates and rii were seen until after 30 min of stress. significantly lower fv/fm and o <dig> evolution rates, as well as a higher rii, were observed in ‘jinxiu’ than in spine grape. the values of the three parameters in ‘riesling’ fell between those of ‘jinxiu’ and spine grape. at 40 min after the application of heat stress, the three cultivars differed significantly for fv/fm, o <dig> evolution rate and rii. moreover, at this point, the difference among the three cultivars for fv/fm was significantly larger than for o <dig> evolution rate or rii. at the end of the experiment, i.e., 50 min after the leaf discs were subjected to heat stress, there was a significant difference only in fv/fm among the three cultivars. for both o <dig> evolution rate and rii, the significant differences disappeared between ‘jingxiu’ and ‘riesling’. in general, the heat injury of spine grape was the least, followed by the tolerances of ‘riesling’ and ‘jinxiu’ . the data indicated that 40 min is an appropriate duration of heat stress at tc  for investigating the heat injury of grapevines and that the ojip test was the most suitable among the three methods due to the sensitivity of its parameters.

electron transport chain of psii in grapevines under tc
the ojip test may also reveal information regarding the electron transport chain of psii  <cit> . the response of the electron transport chain of psii to heat stress under tc  was investigated using the ojip test in ‘jingxiu’, ‘riesling’ and spine grape. the value of wk expresses the changes of the amplitude in the k step in the ojip test, which is used as a specific indicator of damage to the psii donor side. in general, the wk values of the three cultivars increased sharply by 10 min after the initiation of heat stress, then increased more slowly in ‘jingxiu’ and ‘riesling’ from  <dig> to 50 min over the experiment . however, the wk of spine grape changed little after 10 min and was significantly lower than that of the other two cultivars throughout the heat stress period. rcqa indicates the density of the psii reaction centers  <cit> . the rcqa in all genotypes declined rapidly within 10 min of heat stress and continued to decrease slowly over the experiment at tc. the density of rcqa in spine grape was significantly higher than in the other two cultivars after 10 min . the changes in the quantum yield of electron transport  in the grape leaves during heat stress are shown in figure 3c. φeo was used as an indicator of the acceptor side of the electron transport chain of psii  <cit> . heat stress at 47°c altered the φeo values in the grape leaves of all three cultivars. these values were stable after 10 min of heat stress but rapidly decreased thereafter. the spine grape and ‘riesling’ had higher φeo values than did ‘jingxiu’.

evaluation of heat tolerance in  <dig> cultivars  of grapevine under tc
generally, heat injury under heat temperature may indirectly reflect heat tolerance in plants. the more serious heat injury, the weaker heat tolerance. in this study, for evaluating heat tolerance of  <dig> grape cultivars , the parameter fv/fm of the ojip test was chosen to investigate their heat injury under tc. we measured the fv/fm of these genotypes in may, june and july of  <dig> and june and july of  <dig>  positive correlations for the fv/fm values in these grape leaves were observed among the different sampling times . our experiment was conducted in beijing , where the average daily temperature  and lower rainfall in may are more suitable for grapevine growth than are conditions in june and july. therefore, only the data from may  <dig> are reported in this paper, as shown in table  <dig>  the fv/fm values varied greatly with the genetic backgrounds in each genotype group, especially in v. vinifera. most wild grapevines had higher fv/fm values than did domesticated cultivars. the highest fv/fm value was found in v. davidii  at  <dig> , followed by a value of  <dig>  in v. ripara . v. rubra  had the lowest fv/fm value at only  <dig> . interspecific hybrids among wild grapevines had moderate fv/fm values, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig> . however, interspecific hybrids between v. vinifera and v. labrusca had relatively high fv/fm values. the highest fv/fm values were found in ‘kangtai’  at  <dig> , followed by ‘mitsushiru’  at  <dig> . ‘jingyou’  had the lowest fv/fm value at  <dig> . the fv/fm values of the cultivars of v. vinifera ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and most cultivars had lower fv/fm values. the highest fv/fm values were found in ‘riesling’  and ‘cabernet sauvignon’  at  <dig>  each, followed by ‘black balad’ at  <dig> . ‘jingyu’ , ‘muscat hamburg’ , ‘cabernet franc’  and ‘yan73’  all had very low fv/fm values of only  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

discussion
methods of investigating heat injury in grapevines
as determined by weng and lai  <cit> , tc was easily calculated as 47°c using the ojip test parameters of fo and fv/fm.. based on this result, the heat injury of ‘jingxiu’, ‘reisling’ and spine grape was investigated using three methods . these methods led to the same conclusion: the heat injury of spine grape was the least, followed by ‘riesling’ and ‘jinxiu’. although the three methods obtained the same results, they exhibited different characteristics. first, the processes of measuring electrolyte leakage and photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates were more complex and required more time than the ojip test . second, the measurement of electrolyte leakage and photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates must be conducted in the lab and requires small leaf discs. the former method requires a conductivity meter and a water bath, while the later requires an oxygen electrode system, a computer and a water bath. the ojip test can be conducted in the lab or the field, and either leaf discs or whole leaves may be measured using the handy plant efficiency analyzer . third, measuring electrolyte leakage or photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates yields only a single parameter, but the ojip test can produce several parameters, including information regarding the electron transport chain of the photosynthetic apparatus. fourth, the sensitivity of the three methods differed. as shown in figure  <dig>  significant differences in the fv/fm and o <dig> evolution rate values among ‘jinxiu’, ‘riesling’ and spine grape appeared after 30 min of heat stress at tc, but differences in the rii values appeared only after 40 min. after 50 min of heat stress at tc, the differences in o <dig> evolution rate and rii values between ‘jinxiu’ and ‘riesling’ disappeared, but the differences of fv/fm among the three cultivars remained. in general, the ojip test was a rapid, sensitive and convenient method for measuring heat injury in grapevine. moreover, the reproducibility of the method is very high, as shown in the correlation analysis between different years and different months . additionally, the handy plant efficiency analyzer may be used directly in the field. however, this evaluation relies primarily on photosynthesis and does not consider other physiological processes. the results of this study may be further applied in molecular breeding and quantitative trait analysis  by providing stable, sensitive phenotypic data for heat injury.

heat injury in grape leaves is related to the photosynthetic electron transport chain of psii
photosynthesis, especially the electron transport chain of psii, is highly sensitive to high-temperature stress  <cit> . however, it is difficult to pinpoint the specific limiting steps that control the temperature response of the electron transport chain  <cit> . in our study, the decrease of the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate under heat stress was associated with electron transport capacity, which showed that the psii of the photosynthetic apparatus was damaged. the different sensitivities of the parameters derived from the ojip test may reflect the heterogeneous behavior of psii under heat stress conditions. wk expresses the k-step in the ojip test, which is used as a specific indicator of damage to the psii donor side related to the oxygen evolving complex  during heat stress. in this study, the wk value increased significantly by 10 min in all grape genotypes during the heat treatment, demonstrating that the oec is one of the most vulnerable complexes of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. the results also showed that the stability of the oec differs among genotypes, as the oecs of ‘jingxiu’ and ‘riesling’ were more vulnerable than those of the other genotypes.

the density of rcqa may reflect the density of qa-reducing psii reaction centers  <cit> , and the psii reaction center is also one of the sites damaged by heat stress  <cit> . in our study, during heat stress at 47°c, the density of rcqa decreased rapidly by 10 min for all genotypes, which indicated that the psii reaction center was sensitive to heat and that the thermostability of the psii reaction center differed among cultivars. the parameter φeo represents the quantum yield or the energy distribution ratio of the acceptor side of psii. the decrease in φeo showed that the activity of electron transport beyond qa was inhibited in grape leaves after 50 min of heat stress, but after only 10 min, the φeo values showed almost no change. these results indicated that while heat stress damaged the acceptor side of psii, this structure was relatively stable in the initial stages of heat stress. the correlation analysis of the evaluation of different cultivars  further corroborated these results . therefore, the ojip test can also reveal the relationship between heat injury in grape leaves and the photosynthetic electron transport chain of psii.

CONCLUSIONS
the ojip test was quicker, more sensitive and more convenient for investigating the heat injury of grape leaves than were measurements of photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rates or electrolyte leakage. moreover, psii functional analysis using the ojip test indicated that the acceptor side of the photosystem ii was less damaged by heat than were the donor side or the reaction center in grape leaves. the heat tolerance of  <dig> cultivars  was evaluated by determining heat injury using this method. in general, the heat tolerance among cultivars or species varied largely in each genotype group. most wild species and some hybrids of v. labrusca and v. vinifera had relatively strong heat tolerance, while most cultivars of v. vinifera had relatively weak heat tolerance.
