BACKGROUND
sheep are the most important fiber producing animals worldwide. fiber diameter, length and color are key traits contributing to the economic value of sheep and are determined by both genetics  <cit>  and environment  <cit> . factors that determine coat color in sheep are becoming of increasing interest. white fleece holds greatest economic value due to its ability to be dyed to virtually any color, whereas interest in natural colors is increasing due to the green revolution and consumer preference for natural products.

coat color genes are good candidates for facilitation of traceability of animal breeds  <cit> . coat color is determined by amounts and types of melanin produced and released by melanocytes resident in the skin  <cit> . the genetic basis for coat color is well understood in rodents  <cit> , with many common genes also implicated in regulation of coat color in other species, including sheep. for example, mc1r and asip are known to be major regulators of coat color in mice and mc1r <cit>  and asip <cit>  loci are functionally linked to undesirable coat color phenotypes in sheep. in addition, tyrosinase-related protein  <dig>  is a strong positional candidate gene for color variation in soay sheep  <cit> . recent studies have combined snp analysis and gene expression profiling to dissect the basis for the piebald pigmentation phenotype in merino sheep  <cit> . despite considerable knowledge of the genetic regulation of coat color in mice and identification of loci involved in coat color regulation in fiber producing species, the molecular mechanisms, at the level of gene expression, associated with differences in coat color phenotype are not well understood. this information is critical not only to enhanced basic understanding of regulation of melanogenesis, but also to the identification of novel pharmacological and molecular genetics approaches to regulate or select for coat color in fiber producing species.

transcriptional profiling is a powerful approach for identification of genes globally and functionally expressed in various tissues including skin  <cit> . limited information is currently available regarding differences in transcriptome profiles of skin associated with coat color in fiber producing species. to investigate genes that may play important roles in coat color regulation in sheep skin and gain insight into molecular mechanisms responsible for biochemistry of skin and fibers  in animals producing hair such as sheep and alpaca, we investigated the transcriptome profiles in skin of sheep with black versus white coat color using high throughput rna deep sequencing. results provided novel insight into differences in gene expression associated with coat color, including key genes implicated in the melanogenesis pathway.

RESULTS
assembly of unigenes
after the raw reads were filtered,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads with  <dig> % gc percentage and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads with  <dig> % gc percentage were obtained from white and black sheep skin, respectively. these clean reads were assembled into unigenes, yielding  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes from white and black sheep skin, respectively. there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes with sequence size greater than  <dig>  nucleotides in white and black sheep skin, respectively. the longest unigene sequenced was more than  <dig>  nt in length and the average size of the majority of coding sequence  identified was  <dig> nt. there were  <dig>  unigenes with more than  <dig>  nt of cds .

functional classification of the unigenes
blast analysis  of the sheep skin unigenes against the protein and nucleotide databases revealed  <dig>  known genes, of which,  <dig>  were annotated through cog classification analysis. these genes were grouped into  <dig> classes based on their putative functions and the largest group of genes was classified into general function only . the known genes were also annotated through go classification analysis and grouped into  <dig> categories  based on their putative functions .

genes highly expressed in sheep skin
the top  <dig> genes most highly expressed in sheep skin included genes of the keratin family and ribosomal proteins . the most highly expressed gene in sheep skin was 40s ribosomal protein s <dig>  the other highly expressed genes in sheep skin included, nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> , cytochrome c oxidase subunit i , nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain  <dig> , keratin associated protein  <dig>  , keratin  <dig> , high-sulfur keratin biiib <dig> protein, hair keratin cysteine rich protein , keratin-associated protein  <dig>   and keratin-associated protein 3– <dig> . the list of most highly expressed genes also included  <dig> unknown genes.

genes encoding transcription factors expressed in sheep skin
in the transcriptome of sheep skin, there was at least  <dig> genes identified encoding for transcription factors . the highly expressed transcription factor genes in both white and black sheep skin include transcription factor jun-b-like, nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha isoform b, endothelial differentiation-related factor  <dig> isoform alpha, homeobox protein dlx- <dig> , transcription factor ap- <dig> , cyclic amp-dependent transcription factor atf- <dig> , and transcription factor gata <dig>  . most of these transcription factors do not show differential expression between white and black skin. however, some less abundantly expressed transcription factors such as pbx, tcf <dig>  nr2f <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig>  were differentially expressed in white and black sheep skin. transcription factors that are known to regulate mrna expression of coat color genes, such as mitf and creb/atf bzip transcription factor were also found to be expressed in sheep skin. interestingly, both genes were expressed approximately  <dig> times higher in white sheep skin than black sheep skin.

differentially expressed genes in white versus black sheep skin
using an algorithm based on a previously described method  <cit> , genes differentially expressed between white and black sheep skin were identified. there were a total of  <dig>  known genes identified as differentially expressed in white versus black sheep skin, of which  <dig>  were down-regulated  and  <dig> were up-regulated  in skin from black sheep compared with skin from white sheep . for the go analysis,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were grouped in cellular component, molecular function and biological process categories, respectively. most of the differentially expressed genes were classified into two go categories . the majority of the go terms including pigmentation do not appear to be significantly enriched in the differentially expressed genes.

a total of  <dig> novel genes were identified as differentially expressed, of which  <dig> were down-regulated  and  <dig> were up-regulated  in skin from black sheep compared with skin from white sheep. of the  <dig> up-regulated genes,  <dig> genes were exclusively expressed in black sheep skin , and  <dig> genes were expressed  <dig> to  <dig> times higher in black versus white sheep skin .

in order to validate the transcriptome sequencing results, we selected  <dig> genes at random for real time pcr to determine their relative expression in black and white sheep skin. these genes, identified as differentially expressed in black versus white sheep skin based on transcriptome sequencing analysis, included known genes related to coat color in mammals. the results of real time pcr showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> selected genes had significantly higher expression in black sheep skin compared with white sheep skin, which was consistent with the transcriptome sequencing data. among the differentially expressed genes, tyr showed the greatest differential expression between black and white sheep skin .

kegg pathway analysis
of the  <dig>  known genes differentially expressed in white versus black sheep skin,  <dig>  had a specific kegg pathway annotation. of these kegg pathway annotated genes,  <dig> were down-regulated in black sheep skin. these down-regulated genes are mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis and/or gluconeogenesis. remaining kegg pathway annotated genes were associated with  <dig> pathways including those functionally related to coat color in skin such as melanogenesis, tyrosine metabolism and wnt signaling. for example, there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in tyrosine metabolism, wnt signaling and melanogenesis pathways, respectively. the enriched go terms for genes identified in sheep skin transcriptome related to pigmentation and melanogenesis and their relative expression in black versus white skin are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig> 

differential expression of known coat color genes
approximately  <dig> genes involved in different pathways controlling coat color formation have been identified in the mouse  <cit> . those known coat color genes are routinely classified into six general functions including: melanocyte development, components of melanosomes and their precursors, melanosome construction/protein routing, melanosome transport, eumelanin and pheomelanin and systemic effects  <cit> . expression of a total of  <dig> of aforementioned coat color genes was detected in sheep skin in present studies, and  <dig> genes showed higher expression in black sheep skin and  <dig> genes showed higher expression in white sheep skin. interestingly, all genes encoding for the components of melanosomes and their precursors had higher expression in black sheep skin . the coat color genes in the ‘eumelanin and pheomelanin’ functional category showed higher expression in black sheep skin, while genes in the ‘melanosome construction/protein routing ’ category displayed lower expression in black sheep skin. among the coat color genes showing higher expression in black sheep skin, tyrp <dig> showed the highest expression in black sheep skin versus white sheep skin, followed by tyr, mlph, matp and si . the genes associated with oculocutaneous albinism  such as hps <dig>  hps <dig>  hps <dig>  hps <dig> and hps <dig> were expressed in sheep skin but most of them did not show differential expression associated with coat color.

discussion
mammalian coat color exhibits a wide range of shades and is dictated by melanin production in melanocytes . melanogenesis involves a complex molecular regulation  <cit> . in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of coat color formation, previous studies have reported the generation of ests from both sheep and alpaca skin through traditional sanger sequencing  <cit> . a previous study examined differences in gene expression associated with black spots in fleece of corriedale sheep using microarray technology  <cit> . to further investigate genes that may play important roles in sheep skin, particularly in fiber/coat pigmentation, over  <dig> million transcriptome sequence reads were generated from white and black sheep skin using the illumina technology. from these reads there were  <dig>  known unigenes identified as expressed in sheep skin, among which  <dig>  were differentially expressed in black versus white sheep skin. it is acknowledged that study design was not optimal due to limited biological replication because single pooled samples  were used in transcriptome sequencing analysis and the same three samples from white sheep skin and from black sheep skin were used individually for quantitative real time pcr validation of the sequencing results. despite such limitations, results have significantly enhanced understanding of sheep skin transcriptome composition and potential differences in gene expression associated with coat color that are foundational to further study in the future.

genes encoding for ribosomal proteins, keratin family members and keratin associated proteins were among the most highly expressed genes detected in sheep skin. the ribosome is a central player in the translation system and its function is to decode the nucleotide sequence carried by the mrna and convert it into an amino acid primary structure  <cit> . abundant presence of ribosomal proteins in sheep skin suggests the importance of high rates of protein translation in sheep skin. in channel catfish skin, the expression of ribosomal proteins was high presumably due to higher levels of translational activities  <cit> . of the top  <dig> highly expressed genes in sheep skin, all  <dig> keratin family members and keratin associated proteins displayed down regulation in black sheep skin, which was the same as observed in piebald merino sheep skin  <cit> . collectively, results support garcia’s view that no single keratin gene alone appears to be responsible for the coat color trait  <cit> . hair keratins contain a much higher content of cysteine residues in their non-helical domains and thus form tougher and more durable structures via intermolecular disulfide bond formation  <cit> . therefore, high expression of keratins is likely crucial for fleece strength. genes encoding for important oxidative and dehydrolytic enzymes such as nadh <dig> and cox <dig> were also highly expressed in sheep skin. the coenzyme nad  is a key electron-carrier which mediates hundreds of reactions. the redox state of the nad–nadh couple plays a central role in energy metabolism  <cit> , signal transduction  <cit> , and transcriptional regulation  <cit> , which is consistent with the need for mitochondrial biogenesis, energy and other proteins during the strong metabolism characteristic of adult sheep skin development  <cit> .

the human hair follicle  has a variable response to potent androgens, such as testosterone  and dihydrotestosterone . the pilosebaceous unit  enzymatically converts weak androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone  and androstenedione , to more potent androgens, such as t and dht. in hf of scalp, androgens shorten the anagen growth phase of the hair cycle, causing the hf to regress and recede. the conversion of androgens is dependent on oxidized-reduced pyridine cofactors, nad, nadh, and nadph  <cit> . so, the high level of expression of nadh likely improves the conversion of androgens in certain body regions, influencing terminal hair growth.

transcription factors  perform important regulatory functions by controlling a variety of cellular processes  <cit> . in the mouse genome,  <dig>  genes were identified to encode for tfs and  <dig> were expressed in the brain  <cit> . in the current studies expression of  <dig> tf genes was detected in sheep skin, including general tfs such as endothelial differentiation-related factor  <dig> isoform alpha, dlx <dig>  jun, atf <dig> and gata <dig>  the high level of expression of these genes detected in skin reflects their importance in regulation of general transcriptional pathways in sheep skin.

several novel genes were also identified in sheep skin, and a portion of such genes were differentially expressed. two of the novel genes detected lacked orf in sequence reads detected, and were highly abundant and exclusively expressed in black sheep skin. blast analysis of these  <dig> novel genes did not find any similar sequences in ncbi database , suggesting that they could be specific to sheep skin. the differentiated phenotype of melanocytes must be due, at least in part, to differential transcription of melanocyte-specific genes  <cit> . thus, these two novel genes may play an important role in promoting pigmentation and dark coat colors.

the go and kegg pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed that most were associated with the function of cell and cell part ontology categories. of particular interest in our dataset were pathways related to pigmentation and melanogenesis. of the differentially expressed genes, the genes in the category related to ‘the components of melanosomes and their precursor’ and ‘eumelanin and pheomelanin’ were up-regulated in skin from sheep with black coat color. the function of genes in “the components of melanosomes and their precursor” and ‘eumelanin and pheomelanin’ are melanin synthesis and the switch between eumelanin and pheomelanin  <cit> . the darker pigmentation of skin, and possibly of hair, is associated with a higher numbers of melanosomes, although the number of melanocytes remains constant  <cit> . melanocytes in black hair follicles contain the greatest number of melanosomes , while the melanosomes in brown hair bulbs are smaller and those in blonde hair are very poorly melanised. the relationship of less melanin with lighter skin/hair phenotype has been reported in several species, including humans  <cit> , alpaca  <cit> , llama  <cit>  and horse  <cit> . in both domestic sheep and soay sheep, light coat color is known to be due to a decrease in the ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin, relative to black coat color  <cit> .

genes in the ‘melanosome construction/protein routing ’ ontology category, such as hps <dig>  lysosomal trafficking regulator  and pallidin, were all down-regulated in skin of sheep with black coat color. the functions of genes in the ‘melanosome construction/protein routing ’ categories are related to organelle biogenesis  <cit> . the key to melanin production is the organelle that is the site of melanogenesis, the melanosome, whose architecture, intracellular distribution and enzyme catalog are critical  <cit> . hps <dig> protein is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex- <dig>  and its deficiency can result in hermansky–pudlak syndrome   <cit> . hps is a disorder of lysosome-related organelle  biogenesis, resulting in oculocutaneous albinism  <cit> . it has been reported that hps <dig> melanocytes have an approximately normal contingent of the melanogenic protein, tyr <cit> . elucidation of the relationship between lower level of expression of hps <dig> and other genes in this ontology category with black coat color phenotype will require further investigation.

among the differentially expressed coat color genes, tyrp <dig> showed the greatest level of differential expression in black versus white sheep skin. tyrp <dig>  one of the members of the tyrosinase family, is a i type membrane bound protein that is expressed in both melanocytes and the retinal epithelium. tyrp <dig> is involved in the distal eumelanic pathway and plays a role in stabilizing tyr, which is the critical and rate-determining enzyme in melanogenesis  <cit> . there existed a significant association between coat color and tyrp <dig> in soay sheep  <cit> . in the free-living soay sheep, coat color is either dark brown or light tawny color. the light phenotype is determined by homozygosity of a single recessive amino acid change  at coding position  <dig> in the tyrp <dig> gene  <cit> . this is consistent with studies in domestic sheep, where light coat color is known to be due to a decrease in the ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin, relative to black coat color  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, to our knowledge this is the first report of transcriptome analysis of sheep skin from animals with white and black coat color. the present studies have described and revealed a set differentially expressed known and novel genes in sheep skin potentially related to coat color and other physiological functions. the  <dig> novel genes exclusively expressed in skin of sheep with black coat color are of particular interest for further studies to elucidate their functional roles in coat color regulation. results are foundational for future studies to potentially manipulate coat color via pharmacological and genetic approaches.
