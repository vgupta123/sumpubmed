BACKGROUND
comamonas testosteroni is a bacterial species belonging to β-proteobacteria which was originally named as pseudomonas testosteroni using a soil bacterium atcc  <dig> as the type strain  <cit> . in  <dig>  tamaoka et al. reclassified this species into comamonas testosteroni based on phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . c. testosteroni strains are capable of utilizing testosterone, 4-hydroxybenzoate , acetate and lactate as their sole carbon sources, but not glucose and most of the carbohydrates  <cit> . they are strictly aerobic, highly motile and gram-negative rods and can perform nitrate reduction but cannot denitrify  <cit> .

c. testosteroni strains have been paid a great attention duo to their characteristics of degradation for pollutants and resistance to heavy metals. for example, most strains of c. testosteroni were isolated from such environments as active sludge  <cit>  and heavy metal-contaminated mining soil  <cit> ; c. testosteroni t- <dig> could utilize 4-toluenesulphonic acid and 4-sulphobenzoic acid  <cit> ; c. testosteroni spb- <dig>  could utilize 4-sulfophenylcarboxylates  <cit> . c. testosteroni cnb- <dig> have successfully been applied in environment bioremediation to degrade 4-chloronitrobenzene  in the soil  <cit> .

the genetic determinants for the organic compound degradation and heavy metal resistance have been analyzed in several c. testosteroni strains. horinouchi et al. discovered five gene clusters for steroid degradation in the genome of c. testosteroni ta <dig>  <cit> . gene operons responsible for degrading isophthalate and terephthalate to protocatechuate were determined in c. testosteroni yzw-d by wang et al.  <cit> . the operon aph  that encodes phenol hydroxylase and catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase, and the operon aph  that encodes the enzymes for degrading 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde to tca cycle intermediates were found in c. testosteroni ta <dig>  <cit> . a gene cluster for protocatechuate   <dig> -cleavage pathway, which is an important pathway for aromatic compounds, such as 4hba degradation  <cit> , were found in the genome of c. testosteroni cnb- <dig>  <cit> . c. testosteroni cnb- <dig> showed resistance to arsenate and an ars  operon was found on the pcnb <dig> plasmid  <cit> . xiong et al.  <cit>  have reported znta genes responsible for zn resistance in c. testosteroni s <dig> 

so far, the genomic sequences of four c. testosteroni strains have been published. ma et al.  <cit>  sequenced the whole genome of c. testosteroni cnb- <dig>  analyzed its general genome features, and found genes for many functions such as aromatic compound metabolism, transportation system and drug and heavy metal resistance. gong et al.  <cit>  sequenced the genome of the type strain of c. testosteroni atcc  <dig>  weiss et al.  <cit>  sequenced the genome of strain kf- <dig>  and found genes for degradation of aromatic compounds such as a gene cluster for pca  <dig> -cleavage and a gene cluster for isophthalate degradation. in our previous study, a multiple heavy-metal resistant strain named c. testosteroni s <dig> was isolated and its genome was sequenced  <cit> . a series of metal-resistant genes and gene clusters for aromatic compound degradation were found in its genome  <cit> . regarding carbohydrates utilization, studies on both genomes of c. testosteroni strains cnb- <dig> and atcc  <dig> showed that the genes encoding hexokinase and glucokinase were missing  <cit> . however, a comprehensive genomic analysis among the c. testosteroni strains is lacked.

the objective of this study was to analyze the genetic basis responsible for important biological characters in multiple c. testosteroni strains. recently, we have identified ten c. testosteroni strains from different mining soils  <cit>  according to the 16s rrna gene and physiological and biochemical analysis. in order to gain a comprehensive genotypic and phonotypic understanding, we sequenced the ten c. testosteroni strains and analyzed them together with the four published c. testosteroni genomes  <cit> . this study is a first comparative genomic analysis for c. testosteroni strains. the results have revealed information to better understand this bacterial species at genomic level, and importantly, have pointed out potential genetic determinants for the typical characters and high correlation between the phenotypes and their corresponding genotypes .

ortholog clustering analysis
the orthomcl package  <cit>  was used to determine the core-genome and unique genes of each genome. all predicted protein sequences were grouped together and compared with each other using blastp of ncbi-blast  <dig> + program  <cit> . the homologous protein pairs with e-value cutoff 1e- <dig> and percent of match ≥ 50% were parsed, and the normalized homologous scores were calculated. we screened the homologous protein pairs by a custom perl script with percent of identity greater than 50%. then the proteins were grouped into orthologous families by cluster tool mcl , with the inflation value of  <dig> . the unique genes of each genome were identified based on the resultant orthologous families by a custom perl script. the core-genome sizes were estimated by summing the orthologous families that contained genes from all the selected genomes. the pan-genome sizes were estimated by summing all the orthologous families and the single genes together. heap’s law  <cit>  was used to calculate the constant α in power law regression analysis n = κn‐ a which could determine whether pan-genome is open  or closed  .

phylogenetic analysis
consulting the method of li et al.  <cit>  and collins et al.  <cit> , the single copy orthologous gene families , which were extracted from the genomes of  <dig> c. testosteroni strains and from the genomes of  <dig> strains of family comamonadaceae, were used to build phylogenomic trees to present the phylogenetic relationship. the predicted amino acid sequences of each gene family were aligned using clustal w  <cit> . the independent alignments were concatenated to form a pseudo amino acid sequence alignment. the result was submitted to mega <dig>  <cit>  to build neighbor-joining  trees with p-distance. the bootstrap method of  <dig>  bootstrap repetitions was used to assess tree reliability. average nucleotide identity  analysis was performed among the  <dig> genomes from different sampling areas using jspecies <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of important physiological and biochemical characteristics of  <dig> c. testosteroni strains
most of physiological and biochemical characteristics were determined using the api 20ne system , except for the utilization of citrate that was detected using simmons’ citrate assimilation test  <cit> . for utilization of acetate, testosterone and 4hba, the strains were cultured in basal medium containing standard minerals based on stanier et al.  <cit>  and with  <dig> %  sodium acetate trihydrate,  <dig> %  testosterone and  <dig> %  sodium 4hba, respectively, and incubated at 28°c for 10 days. the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of hg, cu and zn were detected in cdm solid medium  <cit>  containing increasing concentrations of hgcl <dig>  cuso4•5h2o, and zncl <dig>  respectively  <cit> . antibiotic susceptibility tests for penicillins , kanamycin, and tetracycline were detected using disk diffusion test on mueller-hinton agar with 10 μg penicillin, 1 μg prostaphlin, 10 μg ampicillin, 30 μg kanamycin and 30 μg tetracycline disks, respectively .

construction of putative metabolic pathways based on the genomic sequences
the predicted proteins of each genome were submitted to kegg automatic annotation server   <cit>  to perform kegg orthology  functional annotation. the results were then submitted to mapper of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  to reconstruct metabolic pathways.

identification of heavy metal- and drug-resistant genes and virulence factors
genes involved in heavy metal- and drug-resistance were identified base on the seed gene functional classification of the “resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds” subsystem on rast server  <cit> . the identified genes were grouped into gene clusters. orthologous genes from each genome were aligned by clustal w  <cit> , concatenated, and then submitted to mega <dig>  <cit>  to build nj trees with p-distance and bootstrap method of  <dig> bootstrap repetitions.

the virulence factors were identified by aligning the predicted protein sequences from the genomes of  <dig> c. testosteroni strains against the virulence factors data bases   <cit>  using blastp of ncbi-blast  <dig> + with the standard of e-value ≤1e- <dig>  identity ≥ 50%, match ≥ 70%.

identification of putative genes responsible for the physiological and biochemical characteristics
genes for nitrate/nitrite reduction were identified base on the seed gene functional classification of the “nitrate and nitrite ammonification” subsystem on rast server  <cit> . five gene clusters for steroid degradation that were found in c. testosteroni strain ta <dig>   <cit>  were searched against each genome sequence using blastn of ncbi-blast <dig> + program  <cit> . protein sequences from these  <dig> gene clusters were also searched against all the predicted proteins in the  <dig> genomes using blastp. gene cluster of pca  <dig> -cleavage  <cit>  that is potentially involved in 4hba degradation was searched against the predicted proteins of genomes of c. testosteroni using blastp. the orthologous genes for steroid degradation, pca  <dig> -cleavage and nitrate/nitrite reduction were used to build evolutionary trees. amino acid sequences of orthologous genes were aligned by clustal w  <cit> , concatenated, and submitted to mega <dig>  <cit>  to build nj trees with p-distance and bootstrap method of  <dig> bootstrap repetitions. the correlation value between genotypes and phenotypes is calculated based on the phenotypic results compared with the presence or absence of the putative corresponding genes.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and features of  <dig> c. testosteroni strains
ten genomes of c. testosteroni  were sequenced in this study using illumina hiseq <dig>  after trimming the raw data, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> paired reads and  <dig>  to  <dig>  single reads with the average read lengths from 94 bp to 96 bp for each genome. the sequencing depths were from  <dig> x to  <dig> x. the reads of each genome were assembled into  <dig> to  <dig> contigs, and the total length of each draft genome was from  <dig> ,365 bp to  <dig> ,604 bp. the contig n <dig> was from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp, and the contig n <dig> was from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp. the details about the sequencing and assembly of each genome are showed in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

features of the ten newly sequenced and four published genomes of c. testosteroni were showed in table  <dig>  the sizes of c. testosteroni genomes are from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, and the g + c contents are from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the predicted numbers of open reading frames  are from  <dig> to  <dig> with the average lengths from 897 bp to 938 bp. these coding sequences cover 85% to 86% of their genome sequences.

the core- and pan-genomes of c. testosteroni
to determine whether the pan-genome of c. testosteroni is closed or open, the heap’s law  <cit>  was used in our study. as showed in figure 1a, the medians of new genes  and the numbers of genomes  are least squares fit of the power law n = κn‐ a, and the constant α is  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this indicated that c. testosteroni may have an open pan-genome. for the  <dig> genomes, the core-genome has  <dig> gene families, and the pan-genome has  <dig>  gene families. the pan-genome size is two times of the average genome size and  <dig>  times of the core-genome size. the core-genome accounts for 35% of the pan-genome and  <dig> % to  <dig> % of each individual genome. in each genome, the unique genes  are from  <dig> to  <dig>  accounting for  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of its total gene numbers .figure  <dig>

phylogenetic relationships between c. testosteroni and other species in family comamonadacea and among c. testosteroni strains
to understand the phylogenetic relationship among the c. testosteroni strains, a neighbor-joining  tree based on the core-genome of the  <dig> c. testosteroni strains was built . the core-genome of the  <dig> c. testosteroni strains contains  <dig>  single copy orthologues. as the tree showed, the strains from the same original area are clustered together except for those from lengshuijiang antimony mine soil. strains from lengshuijiang antimony mine  are distributed in different branches. the strain kf- <dig> is located on a standalone branch.figure  <dig>

family . the different colors indicate different sampling areas of the c. testosteroni strains as in figure 1b. the bootstrap-support value before each node represents the confidence degree of each branch. the accession numbers are listed after each strain in figure b.



to understand the phylogenetic relationship between c. testosteroni and other species in family comamonadacea, we performed phylogenetic analysis among the  <dig> c. testosteroni strains together with eight more sequenced strains from different species of family comamonadacea . a nj tree based on a total of  <dig>  single copy orthologous gene families of  <dig> strains was built . all the  <dig> c. testosteroni strains are grouped together. strain delftia acidovorans sph- <dig>  which was classified to genus comamonas before  <dig>  <cit> , showed a closer relationship with strains of c. testosteroni than with the other seven species of family comamonadacea.

the relationship between the genome similarity and the geographic distance
to understand if there is a distance decay relationship to the genome similarity of this species, we compared the anis with the geographic distances among different isolation areas of the c. testosteroni strains. as showed in figure  <dig>  the anis for strains from different continents are obviously smaller than for strains from the same continents . however, there is no clear ani-distance relationship among the isolation areas inside china  and from different continents .figure  <dig> 
distance decay analysis using anis among
c. testosteroni
strains from different areas. the x axis is the distance between different areas calculated by latitude and longitude . the y axis is the ani between the pairs of strains isolated from different areas. linear regressions were taken between the anis and distances, and the r squares were given. the dotted line separates the ani-distance relations among areas inside china  and those among areas from different continents.



high correlation between phenotypes and genotypes in c. testosteroni
in order to establish the relationship between phenotypes and genotypes among the strains of c. testosteroni and to provide detailed insights into the genomes of this species,  <dig> important phenotypes and their related genome features of  <dig> strains of c. testosteroni isolated in our laboratory  were tested and studied. our results showed a high correlation between the phenotypes and genotypes . first, all the trains showed the ability of nitrate reduction and urea hydrolysis; they can utilize testosterone, adipate, malate, gluconate, acetate, lactate and 4hba as their sole carbon source; they could resist penicillin, prostaphlin, ampicillin, cu and zn. in the genomes of these strains, we found genes or complete metabolic pathways for these features. second, none of the strains showed the ability of tryptophan hydrolysis, glucoside hydrolysis, gelatin hydrolysis, galactoside hydrolysis and glucose acidification; they cannot utilize most carbohydrates such as glucose, arabinose, mannose, mannitol, n-acetyl-d-glucose and maltose; they could not resist tetracycline. in the genomes of these strains, no corresponding genes of these features could be found. third, the strains df <dig>  df <dig>  ds <dig>  s <dig>  jl <dig>  jl <dig> are resistant and d <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig> are sensitive to mercury. in the genomes of df <dig>  df <dig>  ds <dig>  s <dig>  jl <dig>  jl <dig>  the mercury resistance genes could be found, but in the genomes of d <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig> and jc <dig>  the mercury resistance genes could not be found.figure  <dig>

c. testosteroni
strains. a) the heat map that presents  <dig> phenotypes of  <dig> c. testosteroni strains. b) the heat map that presents  <dig> genotypes of  <dig> c. testosteroni strains. the green/red boxes in the heat map represent positive/negative features of strains. the intermediate color in the row for urea hydrolysis in figure a means weak positive response, and the intermediate color in the last three rows in figure a means numerical values.



in all, we found that  <dig> % of a total of  <dig> ×  <dig> biophysical and biochemical characters were concordant between phenotypes and genotypes. the only two exclusions were that arginine double hydrolysis test showed positive on strain jc <dig> and kanamycin resistance test showed positive on strain ds <dig>  but the genes for these metabolisms were not found in their genomes.

important genotypes of c. testosteroni
the conservative gene clusters of nitrate/nitrite reduction founded in all the c. testosteroni genomes and other genomes of comamonadacea
the physiological and biochemical tests showed that all the strains of c. testosteroni have the ability of nitrate reduction. this phenotype has been found in strains of other species of genus comamonas  <cit> . based on rast annotation result, we found  <dig> gene orthologues in the seed subsystem “nitrate and nitrite ammonification”. these genes are distributed in three gene clusters and some dispersal regions in the genomes of c. testosteroni . importantly, a gene cluster responsible for nitrate and nitrite reduction could be found in all of the  <dig> c. testosteroni genomes . similar gene clusters could also be found in all the eight other genomes of comamonadacea. however, some genes were missed in the cluster, or the gene arrangement was quite different .figure  <dig>

c. testosteroni
genomes and the eight other genomes of
comamonadacea
. the gene orthologues for different functions are showed in different colors. white arrows indicate genes for other functions that were not correlated with nitrate/nitrite reduction. the breaks in the clusters from a. avenae subsp. avenae rs- <dig> and v. aporrectodeae subsp. tuberculatae at <dig> mean that the genes are distributed in different contigs. the dotted line in the cluster from a. denitrificans k <dig> means that the interval between the genes is very long.



the key genes for hexose phosphorylation missed in the c. testosteroni genomes
previous studies  <cit>  and our phenotype test both indicated that strains of c. testosteroni cannot use most types of six carbon sugars as their sole carbon sources. to understand the genome bases of this phenotype, we reconstructed the metabolic pathway map of these strains through encyclopedia of genes and genome . the metabolic procedures of the carbon sources in our test  were drawn in figure  <dig>  complete metabolic pathways of adipate, d-gluconate, citrate, malate, acetate and lactate, which can be utilized by these strains, can be found, whereas the phosphorylation steps in the utilization procedure of d-glucose, n-acetyl-d-glucose, d-mannose and d-mannitol, which cannot be utilized by these strains, cannot be found. these results are consistent with previous reports that the glucokinase and hexokinase were missed  <cit>  in the genomes of c. testosteroni.figure  <dig>

. labels in blue indicate different pathways of kegg pathway map. the red points represent the substrates we tested in physiological and biochemical test. arrows and points in black mean that the pathway could be found whereas those in grey mean that the pathway cannot be found in the genomes of the c. testosteroni strains. the red crosses indicate the lacked phosphorylation steps in the utilization procedure of d-glucose, n-acetyl-d-glucose, d-mannose and d-mannitol. this pathway map is common for all the strains of c. testosteroni.



genomic bases of utilization of steroids and aromatic compounds in c. testosteroni
testosterone  degradation is the main feature of c. testosteroni, based on which this species was identified and named  <cit> . we searched the five gene clusters relating to steroid degradation, which were found in c. testosteroni strain ta <dig>  <cit> , in the  <dig> genomes of c. testosteroni. as showed in figure  <dig>  these clusters were distributed in a  <dig> kb region on the genome sequence of the strain cnb- <dig>  based on the genomic dna sequences, all the five gene clusters  could be found in each of the c. testosteroni genomes, while based on the predicted protein sequences, the orf <dig> was missed in kf- <dig> and jl <dig> genomes . however, the orf <dig> is similar to the orf <dig> , and they both showed to have a ggct-like domain by searching the conserved domain database  <cit> . therefore, lacking the orf <dig> may not affect the steroid degradation function. we also searched these five gene clusters in other genomes of the family comamonadacea and could not find any complete one. only the homologous genes of tesg and tesf could be found .figure  <dig>

c. testosteroni
strains. the distribution of these clusters on the genome of strain cnb- <dig> is showed in the middle. the genes in each cluster are showed above and below and marked with genbank accession number of homologous cluster from c. testosteroni ta <dig>  the black arrows indicate that the genes could be found in all of the strains. the white arrow indicates that the orf <dig> is missed in the strain kf- <dig> and jl <dig>  the genes of these gene clusters from each genome could be viewed in additional file 6: table s <dig> 



a previous report indicated that strains of c. testosteroni could utilize 4hba  <cit> . our phenotype tests showed that all strains of c. testosteroni could use 4hba as their sole carbon source. we searched the genes for 4hba degradation using blastp and kegg annotation tools. the gene cluster which is potentially involved in pca   <dig> -cleavage  <cit> , and the gene for transforming 4hba into pca were found in the genomes of this species . this gene cluster was separated into two contigs and part of the orf that codes for pca  <dig> -dioxygense beta chain was missed in genome sequences of d <dig>  df <dig>  df <dig>  ds <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig>  jc <dig>  jl <dig> and jl <dig> , probably due to the inability of the illumina sequencing method in this region.figure  <dig>

c. testosteroni
genomes that is potentially involved in pca  <dig> -cleavage pathway. the genes’ functions were annotated according to ni’s report  <cit>  and rast annotation result. the orthologues for different functions are showed in different colors. the breaks in the cluster mean that the genes are separated in different contigs. the genes of this cluster from each genome could be viewed in additional file 7: table s <dig> 



the genes for antibiotics and heavy metal resistance
our previous study showed that the strain s <dig> of c. testosteroni has multiple heavy metal resistances  <cit> . in this study, we found that all strains of c. testosteroni can resist cu, zn, penicillin, prostaphlin and ampicillin. six of them can resist hg. based on rast annotation result, gene clusters and scattered genes relating to heavy metal and medico resistances were found in the genomes of c. testosteroni. of these gene clusters,  <dig> were shared in all of the  <dig> genomes . they included homologous genes for rnd transporter families such as czc family of cobalt-zinc-cadmium rnd efflux transporter, cme family of multidrug resistance rnd efflux system and multidrug efflux rnd membrane fusion protein mexc, and homologous genes for copper homeostasis such as copper homeostasis protein cute, copper chaperone and copper-translocation p-type atpase. besides, there were many types of gene clusters that were not shared in all of these genomes . genes in these clusters included those resistant to mercury, arsenic and chromium. rnd efflux systems of cobalt-zinc-cadmium  and multidrug were also found. in addition, many scattered genes such as those for penicillins and fosfomycin resistances were found.

antibiotics and metal resistances are usually co-selected. the main mechanisms of this phenomenon are co-resistance and cross-resistance  <cit> . co-resistance means that the genes for antibiotics and metal resistances are located in the same genetic element. cross-resistance means that the different resistant phenotypes are controlled by the same gene or the same group of genes. in the genomes of c. testosteroni, we found that the genes for different resistance functions were usually clustered in accord with co-resistance. for example, a gene for copper binding protein and a gene for cu responsive transcriptional regulator are located near some rnd efflux czc family genes . also, the genes for the cross-resistance can be found in these genomes, such as the cobalt-zinc-cadmium efflux system czc family  <cit>  and multidrug resistance system  <cit> . notably, most of these efflux systems belong to the resistance-nodulation-cell division  family.

the phylogenetic relationships of the genotypes consistent among the strains of c. testosteroni
to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of the genes for nitrate reduction, steroids degradation, pca  <dig> -cleavage and antibiotics and heavy metal resistance that are consistent among the strains of c. testosteroni, we built nj trees of these genes from shared gene clusters . we found that the p-distance between genes of these genotypes are no greater than  <dig> . in comparison, the p-distance between homologous proteins from different genus are at least greater than  <dig>  . this indicated that the genes of these clusters are highly conserved. comparing these trees with the nj tree of core-genome of the  <dig> c. testosteroni strains , common features on topology were found. all the strains from jixi are grouped together and all the strains from daye are grouped together in each tree. strains from china  except those from lengshuijiang are located closely in all of the trees except that of pca  <dig> -cleavage. the strains from lengshuijiang are distributed in different branches .figure  <dig>

virulence factors in c. testosteroni
in order to identify potential virulence factors  in the genomes of c. testosteroni, we aligned proteins from the  <dig> genomes against virulence factors data base   <cit>  using blastp with the standard e-value ≤1e- <dig>  identity ≥ 50%, and match ≥ 70%. as result, we identified  <dig> types of vfs that were involved in  <dig> functions such as adherence, anti-phagocytosis, invasion, and secretion system. of them,  <dig> vfs are owned by all of the strains. these vfs include  <dig> types of secretion system , urease, flagella of invasion, alginate used for anti-phagocytosis, type iv pili for adherence. comparing the shared vfs between every two strains, we found that the average identity of the orthologous vfs from different combinations is 99%. the gene numbers of all the found vfs are showed in additional file 9: table s <dig> 

discussion
the concept of pan-genome was first introduced in  <dig>  <cit> . it is the collection of the total genes that could be found in a species. the pan-genome could reflect the gene pool size of a bacterium  <cit> . in this study, heap’s law  <cit>  analysis showed that the pan-genome of c. testosteroni is open. however, there are limitations in this analysis. first, the strains were not randomly sampled. some genomes are very similar , and some genomes are significantly different from the others . therefore, we could notice a “break” in figure 1a. second, because most of the genomic sequences are draft, some genes may be lost in the sequences . this may result in an underestimated core-genome and an overestimated pan-genome.

according to the natural selection theory, environment could affect organisms’ genetic characters. in our study, we found: a) the strains isolated from the same areas  are always clustered together , and b) anis among strains from different continents are lower than those from the same continents. these results revealed that the genome similarity of most c. testosteroni strains followed a certain degree of distance-similarity decay relationship.

in previous studies, strains of c. testosteroni showed abilities for nitrate reduction, and utilization of testosterone, 4hba, acetate and lactate, but they cannot utilize glucose and most of the carbohydrates  <cit> . in this study, we found that most of the above phenotypes of c. testosteroni are consistent with previous studies and consistent among all the tested strains of c. testosteroni, indicating that these important phenotypes are very stable and common in c. testosteroni, and could be used in the polyphasic taxonomy in identification of this species.

the key step of aromatic compounds degradation is the benzene ring cleavage and the main pathway for this reaction in strains of genus comamonas is pca  <dig> -cleavage  <cit> . in previous study, genes or potential genes for pca  <dig> -cleavage were found in many strains of c. testosteroni such as c. testosteroni br <dig>  <cit>  and c. testosteroni cnb- <dig>  <cit> . in this study, potential genes for this function could be found in all of the genomes of c. testosteroni  and the gene cluster for pca  <dig> -cleavage is very conserved among the c. testosteroni strains . this indicated that the strains of c. testosteroni would have potential abilities to degrade various aromatic compounds.

ma et al.  <cit>  built a main metabolic pathway map of c. testosteroni cnb- <dig>  they found that the glycolysis is incomplete due to lack of the hexokinase and glucokinase genes so that the strain cannot utilize most types of sugars. studies on the genomes of c. testosteroni strains atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and kf- <dig>  <cit>  showed the same results. we built metabolic pathway maps of  <dig> strains of c. testosteroni  and showed that all genes for hexose phosphorylation were missed in all genomes of this species . this result effectively supports the previous studies and indicates that lack of these genes should be a common genome feature of c. testosteroni.

comparison between the phylogenomic tree of c. testosteroni  and the phylogenetic trees of the genes from the gene clusters for nitrate/nitrite reduction, steroids degradation, antibiotics and heavy metal resistance  revealed that the gene clusters for these functions are conserved and their evolutions are consistent with the evolution of the core-genome. this indicated that the shared gene clusters for these functions are inherent in the genomes of c. testosteroni, and they may have suffered little natural selection pressure during the evolutionary process of c. testosteroni.

as an environmental bacterium, c. testosteroni is often considered to be nonpathogenic. however, according to the survey by farshad et al.  <cit> , up to  <dig>  there were  <dig> reported cases of human infection by this bacterium. c. testosteroni infected central nervous system  <cit> , blood  <cit> , mitral valve  <cit> , subcutaneous tissue  <cit> , eye  <cit> , abdominal cavity  <cit>  and urinary tract  <cit> , that caused purulent meningitis, bacteremia, cellulitis, infectious endocarditis, post-operative endophthalmitis and other diseases. nevertheless, few molecular biological investigations were taken on the pathogenicity of c. testosteroni. in this study,  <dig> types of vfs were found in the genomes of c. testosteroni with high protein-to-protein identify  and match . further, we found that the shared vfs among the c. testosteroni are highly conserved. this result proposed the molecular biological basis of the potential pathogenicity of this bacterium.

genotype determines phenotype. jung et al.  <cit>  found many genotypes relating to antibiotic resistance, oxidative stress, motility, and pectin metabolism in alishewanella species, and confirmed the phenotypes of them. ma et al.  <cit>  examined the ability of the utilization of many sugars of c. testosteroni cnb- <dig> and confirmed the genome features that support these phenotypes. however, such a study that focuses on all the main recognition properties and their genome bases on an environmental bacterium is rare. in this study, we found a high correlation between phenotypes and genotypes of this species. the related genes may be useful to study the molecular mechanisms of c. testosteroni.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we generated the sequences of  <dig> genomes of c. testosteroni and performed comparative genomics analysis among the available genomes of this bacterium. we found that the pan-genome of c. testosteroni may be open. physiological and biochemical investigation showed that c. testosteroni has the main properties of nitrate reduction, ability of utilizing testosterone, 4hba, acetate and lactate, and disability of utilizing glucose and most carbohydrates. genomic analysis revealed the molecular biological bases of these phenotypes. the phenotypes and genotypes of these features could be used in polyphasic taxonomy and molecular identification of this species. this study is the first comprehensive genomic analysis for c. testosteroni and provides information for better understanding this bacterial species at genomic level. importantly, this study focused on the analysis of potential genetic determinants for the typical characters, and found the high correlation between the phenotypes and their corresponding genotypes .
