BACKGROUND
recent findings have shed light on the integration of adult-born hippocampal dentate gyrus  neurons into mature synaptic networks  <cit> . how and why these new neurons are formed has become an intriguing question  <cit> . because the circadian clock machinery can control intrinsic regulation of cell proliferation in peripheral tissues  <cit>  we hypothesized that clock genes might influence neural stem/progenitor cell  division in the central nervous system.

adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mammals is a plastic process placed under the control of environmental stimuli, which is comparable to the regulation of circadian rhythms  <cit> . hormonal cycles and psychosocial stress  <cit> , serotonin metabolism  <cit> , depression  <cit> , aging  <cit> , physical activity  <cit> , sleep deprivation  <cit>  and enriched living conditions  <cit>  influence the rate of neuronal renewal and survival in various adult organisms. this suggests that mechanisms controlling life-long neurogenesis in the postnatal cns are adapted to complex extrinsic inputs. neurogenesis appears to be regulated by such physiological and behavioural parameters that are somehow connected to the circadian clock that synchronizes itself to changing environmental conditions to optimize an organism's performance. recent work has consistently shown a diurnal rhythm of neurogenesis among the olfactory projection neurons in the crustacean brain, with peak of neuroblasts proliferation during the hours surrounding dusk, the most active period for lobsters  <cit> . these data suggest the possibility that light-controlled rhythms may be primary regulators of neuronal proliferation, and that previously demonstrated hormonal and activity-driven influences over adult neurogenesis may be secondary events in a complex circadian control pathway.

intriguingly, the expression of circadian genes that belong to the intracellular clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus  have also been described in other brain areas, in peripheral organs and even in immortalized cell lines in culture  <cit> . the mper <dig> gene is one of the three mammalian orthologs  of the drosophila circadian clock gene period  <cit> . in situ hybridization experiments have established that mper <dig> and mper <dig> genes are expressed in the hippocampus and particularly in the dg where their function remains elusive  <cit> . the rate of cell cycle kinetics and neurogenesis are tightly coupled in the adult mammalian dg. the overall duration of the cell cycle in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells is about  <dig> hours  <cit>  and very close if not identical to the circadian period. there is already substantial in vivo evidence that outside the mammalian brain, circadian rhythms control the timing of cell division  <cit> . accordingly, light/dark variations of the mitotic index and dna synthesis occur in many tissues, i.e. oral mucosa  <cit> , tongue keratinocytes  <cit> , liver  <cit> , skin  <cit>  and bone marrow  <cit> .

in the present work, we wanted to decipher whether mper <dig>  one of the central component of the circadian clock machinery, regulates the proliferation and the maturation of npcs into granule neurons in the hippocampal dg of adult mice. we used the per2brdm <dig> mutant mice line to assess the specific requirement of mper <dig> in adult neurogenesis. here, we showed that mper <dig> was non-rhythmically expressed in the granule neuronal lineage in the adult dg. in adult per2brdm <dig> mice, we found an increase in both the proliferation of npcs and the number of immature granule neurons expressing dcx and neurod. strikingly, the pool of adult generated mature granule cells was not enlarged, as one would expect. the accumulation of supernumerary mature granule cells was prevented by apoptosis in the dg of per2brdm <dig> mice. our results suggest that mper <dig> belongs to the molecular machinery that underlies the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating the early cellular events leading to the production of post-mitotic granule cells in the dg.

RESULTS
constitutive expression of mper <dig> in the adult dentate gyrus
the expression profile of mper <dig> in the dg region of the hippocampus was established by immunohistochemistry using two different polyclonal antibodies on  <dig> μm-thick coronal sections from p <dig> adult male mice. both anti-mper <dig> antibodies lead to similar expression patterns . mper <dig> was highly expressed throughout the adult hippocampus and particularly in the granule cell layer , subgranular layer  and the hilus  of the dg . in order to determine whether mper <dig> expression levels could undergo rhythmic oscillations in the dg, immunostainings and western blots were performed at several circadian time points including zt <dig>  zt <dig>  zt <dig> and zt <dig>  surprisingly, immunolabellings revealed that the level of mper <dig> was comparable throughout circadian zts . in contrast, mper <dig> expression displayed circadian oscillations in the scn with a peak of expression at zt <dig>  as previously shown  <cit> . western blots analysis performed on micro-dissected dg confirmed that mper <dig> levels were constitutively stable with time, as previously described for its transcript  <cit> , as compared to the scn, where the maximum of mper <dig> expression occurs at zt <dig> .

mper <dig> is expressed by npcs and throughout the granule cell lineage in the adult dentate gyrus
in order to define the phenotypic identity of mper2+ cells in the adult dg, we performed immunohistochemical stainings with cell type-specific markers. the adult dg contains several cell types including glia-like stem cells , transiently amplifying proliferating precursor cells , proliferating neuroblasts , immature neurons , mature neurons  astrocytes  and oligodendrocytes   <cit> . we never found any sox2+/ki67-/mper2+ cells , indicating that glial-like stem cells are mper <dig> negative. we observed that some transit amplifying progenitors sox2+/ki67+ expressed mper <dig> . in situ hybridization with antisense mper <dig> probe, followed by immunohistochemistry, confirmed the expression of mper <dig> mrna dividing ki67+ and brdu+ cells of the sgl . labelling was absent in control sections hybridized with sense probe . we quantified dividing cells expressing mper <dig> in the adult dg and found that  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of ki67+ cells expressed mper <dig> . neurod and dcx are indeed expressed early in the lineage-determined neuronal cells in the adult hippocampus, i.e. in precursor cells to immature neurons. we observed that some mper2+ cells expressed dcx and are neun negative , suggesting that mper <dig> is expressed in proliferating dcx+ precursor cells. using double immunostainings to detect mper <dig> in immature and mature neurons, we found  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of neurod+-,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of dcx+ neuroblasts and 100% of neun+ neurons  expressed mper <dig>  altogether, our findings indicate that in the neuronal lineage, mper <dig> expression starts in immature proliferating cells and persists in mature neurons .

while mper <dig> was not expressed by astrocytes  nor oligodendroglial lineage  <cit>  , some gabaergic interneurons of the sgl and the hilus were mper2+ .

the pool of adult hippocampal npcs is increased in per2brdm <dig> mice
to define whether mper <dig> controlled the proliferation of hippocampal npcs, we analyzed the dg of p <dig> wt and per2brdm <dig> male littermates  <cit>  and observed a significant increase in the total number of ki67+ cells in the dg of per2brdm <dig> mice as compared to wt  . moreover, short-pulsed brdu incorporation assays  revealed an increase in s-phase cells in the dg of per2brdm <dig> mice  . altogether, these results support a role for mper <dig> in the regulation of the proliferation of npcs in the adult dg.

mper <dig> mutation results in an excess of newly formed neurons in the subgranular layer of the adult dentate gyrus
in comparison to wt animals, the number of immature neurons expressing neurod  and dcx  was significantly increased in the sgl of mper <dig> mutant mice . we designed a "short-term" birthdating brdu incorporation experimental protocol to assess neurogenesis during a short time window of  <dig> days. in agreement with the expansion of the pool of immature dcx+ and neurod+ cells, we observed a 3-fold increase of brdu+/neurod+ immature newborn neurons in the dg of per2brdm <dig> mice as compared to wt .

mper <dig> regulates the proliferation and differentiation of npcs in vitro
to correlate the selective increase of adult npcs proliferation and neuroblasts differentiation in the dg of per2brdm <dig> mutant mice with a functional in vitro assessment of their proliferative potential ant their multi-lineage differentiation capacity, we compared the potential of wt and per2brdm <dig> npcs from the dg to form neurospheres and to differentiate into neurons. we showed that per2brdm <dig> npcs generated significantly larger neurospheres compared with corresponding cells from wt mice . a careful analysis of the size of secondary neurospheres showed that per2brdm <dig> npcs generated a reduce number of spheres within the range of 50– <dig> μm diameter and a significant increase in the number or spheres within > <dig> μm range  .

to investigate whether the lack of mper <dig> regulates the differentiation of neurosphere composing cells, we plated neurospheres  <dig> days in differentiating condition. these cells generate astrocytes, oligodendrocytes  and neurons  in both genotypes. among the progeny of per2brdm <dig> neurospheres, we observed a significant increase of differentiated neurons   . conversely, similar percentages of differentiated astrocytes  and oligodendrocytes  were found in both genotypes . altogether, these in vitrodata confirmed our in vivo results and strongly support mper <dig> as a key player regulating both the proliferation and the neuronal differentiation of npcs derived from the dg of adult mice.

increased apoptotic cell death eliminates supernumerary newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of adult per2brdm <dig> mice
we performed "long-term" birthdating brdu incorporation assays to analyze the final fate and survival of newly formed neurons. animals were sacrificed  <dig> days after the end of brdu injection period. in contrast with the results obtained using a "short-term" brdu incorporation protocol, we found no difference in the number of mature granule neurons brdu+/neun+ in the dg of both wt and per2brdm <dig> mice  .

it is established that during the first  <dig> to  <dig> weeks following cell cycle exit, only a fraction of adult-born neurons are functionally integrated into the neuronal network of the dg while most newly formed neurons are naturally dying through apoptosis  <cit> . we thus performed tunel stainings to analyze the apoptotic cell death occurring in the dg of per2brdm <dig> and wt male littermates . the number of tunel+ cells was significantly increased in the dg of the per2brdm <dig> mutant mice as compare to wt  . some tunel+ cells were also co-labelled with brdu  indicating that dying cells were newborn neurons . these results suggest that the newborn neurod+/dcx+ cells in per2brdm <dig> mice are cleared from the dg through apoptosis .

discussion
the importance of the scn to generate a multitude of circadian rhythms  <cit>  suggests that most peripheral tissues, including other areas of the brain, are also likely to be under the "circadian" control of the scn. our data show that mper <dig> clock protein expression is not oscillating in the murine adult dg. this is the first demonstration suggesting that a mammalian clock protein is constitutively expressed in a specific region of the adult brain. previous findings in agreement with this observation showed a non-circadian expression of mper <dig> mrna in the adult dg  <cit> , thymus  <cit>  and testes  <cit> .

it is commonly established that the adult dg is composed of several cell types that include quiescent or slowly dividing and highly proliferating npcs, immature and mature neurons  <cit> . our results indicated that mper <dig> expression starts in proliferating npcs and remains sustained in newborn neurons from the early post-mitotic stage up to mature granule neuronal stage. similar to the adult dg, murine testes and thymus also retain, to a certain extent, self-renewal capacities during adulthood  <cit> . in these organs, the constant expression of circadian clock gene, including mper <dig>  strongly suggest that this constitutive expression is a general feature of adult differentiating tissues and that these genes may have new clock-unrelated functions  <cit> .

we wanted here to characterize the putative functions of mper <dig> in the dg of the hippocampus during adult neurogenesis. our results indicate that a functional impairment of mper <dig>  increased both the number of proliferating npcs and the production of immature newborn neurons in the dg of adult mice. hence, the increased number of early newborn post-mitotic neurons that we observed in the dg of per2brdm <dig> mice provided evidence that the expansion in the npcs pool is not attributable to a delayed cell cycle exit. in line with our in vivo findings, in vitro analyze revealed that cultured npcs isolated from the dg of mper2brdm <dig> mice generated larger neurospheres as compared to wt. this result argues in favour of mper <dig> control of npcs proliferation in neurospheres. in addition, the number of neurons generated from mper2brm <dig> neurospheres significantly increased, suggesting that mper <dig> regulates the differentiation npcs into postmitotic neurons. altogether, these observations obtained from complementary models strongly support a dual function for mper <dig> during adult neurogenesis. our data support the circadian gene mper <dig> as a new intrinsic regulator of both the proliferation and differentiation in npcs of the adult murine dg. interestingly, mper <dig> could belong to a global machinery that coordinates the proliferation with the differentiation of npcs as other molecules  controlling both events have recently been identified  <cit> . in line with our observations, the inhibition of mper <dig> synthesis in ganglionic eminence cultures results in an increased proliferation  <cit> .

although the molecular events triggered by mper <dig> to regulate these events are not well characterized, the transcription of the proto-oncogene c-myc is deregulated in per2brdm <dig> mice, which consequently are prone to hyperplasia and tumours  <cit> . furthermore, the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as cyclin d <dig>  cyclin a, and p <dig>  is deregulated in many tissues of per2brdm <dig> mice  <cit> . in addition, reduced levels of mper <dig> expression were observed in different tumours including lymphoma, breast or endometrial cancer  <cit>  and the overexpression of mper <dig> in tumour cells led to dramatic growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest  <cit> . these data are consistent with the observation that mper <dig> may prevent cell cycle progression and promote the exit of the cell cycle of npcs in the adult dg. however, the molecular pathways underlying mper <dig> activity in these cells and which role cell cycle-related genes may play to mediate these effects still need to be elucidated.

by associating with specific cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases  and hence blocking their catalytic activities during cell cycle progression, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors promote cell cycle exit at g <dig> restriction point in various tissues during development  <cit> . among them, p21cip <dig> and p27kip <dig> are expressed in neuroblasts and newly developing neurons in the adult dg  <cit> . our preliminary data suggests that p27kip <dig> expression broadly overlaps with mper <dig> in early post-mitotic hippocampal immature neurons . in addition, the proliferation and the number of dcx+ cells in the adult dg, are increased in p21cip1-/- mice  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown recently that the circadian clock component bmal <dig>  regulates the expression of p21cip <dig> in hepatocytes  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest p21cip <dig> and p27kip <dig> as strong candidates that could act downstream mper <dig> to inhibit npcs proliferation in the adult dg.

unexpectedly, the number of newly formed mature granule neurons was similar in wt and per2brdm <dig> mice. during the first weeks following cell cycle exit, only a part of the newly generated cells find their definitive place in the hippocampal circuitry while around 50% of them are naturally eliminated through apoptosis  <cit> . previous works have shown that programmed cell death is a physiological process that occurs during neurogenesis in the adult dg  <cit> . in per2brdm <dig> mice, despite an increased proliferation of npcs and an increased number of early newborn neurons, we did not find any significant enlargement of the dg. however, we observed more tunel+ cells in the dg of per2brdm <dig>  we can suggest two possible explanations for this increased cell death phenomenon. first, mper <dig> may regulate the expression of pro-survival genes that would be underexpressed in per2brdm <dig> and lead to the death of newly born granule cells in the dg. such selective or combined effects on distinct phases of neurogenesis have already been reported. for instance, an enriched environment is known to affect only cell survival  <cit>  whereas physical exercise  <cit> , seizures  <cit>  or absence of tlr <dig>  <cit>  increase both cell proliferation and cell survival. alternatively, the excessive cell death observed in per2brdm <dig> mouse dg could be an indirect consequence, i.e. a secondary and compensatory response to increased cell proliferation in per2brmd <dig> mice. in this case, the production of new neurons in the hippocampus would be regulated by a physiological and homeostatic parapet. similar homeostatic regulations of the formation of new neurons have been described for mcd24-deficient mice  <cit>  or after a treatment with antidepressant drugs  <cit> . reciprocally, enhanced survival of new granule cells was reported after hampering cell proliferation with methylazoxymethanol or in synapsin iii knock-out mice  <cit> . excess number of immature, dcx+ and neurod+ neuroblasts as reported in the dg of per2brdm <dig> mice may increase competition for trophic signals required for the maintenance of a mature dg neuronal phenotype as suggested previously  <cit> .

altogether, these data implied that precursor cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell differentiation are all essential events that regulate the final number of new granule neurons in the adult hippocampus. importantly, our results show that an increased neuronal cell death prevents the accumulation of supernumerary newborn neurons in per2brdm <dig> mutant mice.

CONCLUSIONS
the present work has unravelled an original functional link between the constitutive expression of the circadian gene mper <dig> and the intrinsic control of npcs proliferation, cell death and neurogenesis in the adult dg. these findings now raise new questions that include the identification of the presumably complex molecular network activated by mper <dig> and required to tune the fine balance existing between cell proliferation, cell death and differentiation during adult hippocampal neurogenesis. to what extent the expression of circadian genes in the dg of the hippocampus is related or synchronized by central scn induced rhythms remains to be elucidated. this work also emphasizes that a better understanding of the molecular cues that control circadian gene expression in the hippocampus may open new avenues to regulate neurogenesis and its yet unknown physiological function in the adult hippocampus.
