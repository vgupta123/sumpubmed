BACKGROUND
avian influenza virus  infection is a world-wide threat to both human and avian species. aiv causes an infection of the respiratory tract of the host, triggering a cascade of innate and adaptive immune responses. great efforts have been made to develop new intervention strategies to control aiv infections in chickens
 <cit> . however, more effective measures against aiv infection in the chicken are still needed. ai outbreaks in chickens could not only cause dramatic economic losses to the poultry industry, but also threaten human health. therefore, understanding host response to aiv infection and chicken-virus interaction is not only essential to the poultry industry, but also provides key insights into the prophylactic and therapeutic protection for other influenza hosts including humans.

mirnas are short, 17– <dig> nt rnas, which comprise a large family of regulatory molecules found in almost all multi-cellular organisms
 <cit> . these small rnas have been demonstrated to have important functions in a variety of biological processes and have been implicated in many diseases including influenza, hepatitis and cancer
 <cit> . mirnas are capable of regulating mammalian immune cell differentiation, the outcome of immune responses to infection, and the development of diseases of immunological origins
 <cit> . there are multiple mechanisms of mirna-mediated regulation of gene expression including translational repression, disruption of mrna stability, mirna-mediated deadenylation and inhibition of polypeptide elongation
 <cit> . determining how and when mirna suppress target mrna gene expression remains one of the greatest challenges in the field.

through recognition of sequence-complementary target elements, mirnas can either translationally suppress or catalytically degrade both cellular and viral rnas
 <cit> . host mirnas are able to impinge on viral life cycles, viral tropism, and the pathogenesis of viral diseases
 <cit> . mirnas can potentially regulate different steps of a virus life cycle and abrogate toxicities of replication-competent viruses
 <cit> . for example, human mir- <dig> represses the replication of the retrovirus primate foamy virus type  <dig>  through the down-regulation of replication-essential viral proteins encoded by open reading frame  <dig> 
 <cit> . based on computational prediction, human mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have potential binding sites at the polymerase basic  <dig>  and hemmagglutinin  proteins of h5n <dig> aiv, and those two mirnas may modulate aiv infection in humans
 <cit> .

next generation sequencing  has provided a powerful tool to identify differentially expressed mirnas especially low abundance ones under conditions of physiological perturbation. we previously used a solexa sequencer to identify differentially expressed chicken mirnas in aiv infected lungs and trachea of layer type birds
 <cit> . genetics play a significant role in host response to viral infection. we hypothesize that gene expression of host cellular mirnas following virus infection could be different between different chicken genetic lines. there are two major types of chickens: broilers  and layers . in the current study, a deep sequencing approach was employed to identify differentially expressed mirnas with aiv infection in broilers.

identification of differentially expressed host mirnas is just the first step towards understanding mirna regulation of host-virus interactions, and then underlying mechanisms that how genes targeted by differentially expressed mirnas mediate host-virus interaction would be desired. dissection of mirna modulation of both host and viral mrna expression will provide insights in the cellular mechanisms of host-virus interaction. a powerful symbiosis between microarrays and ngs technologies has been witnessed
 <cit> . therefore, global gene expression  profiling of host response to aiv infection was conducted to identify potential genes associated with aiv infection using a chicken  <dig> k agilent microarray. we integrated predicted target genes information  with differentially regulated mrna affected by aiv infection to understand how mirnas regulate mrna gene expression with aiv infection in the chicken.

RESULTS
virus titers in lungs
virus replication in lungs was examined using real-time rt-pcr by measuring influenza virus matrix gene from total rnas at  <dig> days post inoculation . virus titers in the four infected chicken, determined by extrapolation of real-time rt-pcr data, were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  log <dig> eid50/ml. lung samples from all  <dig> non-infected chickens were negative.

mirna sequences from small rna libraries
a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> filtered high quality reads were obtained from infected and non-infected chicken, respectively . in the library from infected chicken lungs,  <dig> , <dig> of these reads were exact matches and another  <dig>  reads were loose matches to known chicken mirnas. in the library of non-infected chicken lungs,  <dig> , <dig> of these reads were exact matches and another  <dig>  reads were loose matches to known chicken mirnas. all reads with a perfect match to mature mirna sequences from chicken deposited in mirbase version  <dig>  
 <cit>  with insertions or deletions of 1– <dig> nucleotides at the 5’ and 3’ ends of mirnas were considered to represent dicer-processing products from each of the chicken mirna precursors
 <cit> . the loose match reads were defined as no more than  <dig> nt differences comparing to the known chicken mirna sequences determined as we did previously
 <cit> . the sum of exact and loose match reads was used as the total number of reads for each mirna.

of the  <dig> distinct gallus gallus  mirna entries in mirbase
 <cit> ,  <dig> mirnas were identified in the current chicken lung small rna library. also, one potential novel mirna was identified . differential expression of this novel mirna “n1” and chicken mirna mir- <dig> were confirmed by northern blot analysis .

mirna expression profiling analysis
mirna expression profiles of infected and non-infected chicken lungs were compared. differentially expressed mirnas were identified  by fisher’s exact test. between infected and non-infected lungs,  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed. of those,  <dig> mirnas were unique to infected lung and  <dig> mirnas were unique to uninfected lung. sixty-five mirnas were more highly expressed in infected lungs, while  <dig> mirnas were more highly expressed in non-infected lungs . with limited biological replicates for the nature of next generation sequencing technology, there is no standard method available for this type of analysis. two newly developed methods : deseq and edger, were implemented in this study. the differentially expressed mirnas are presented in tables
 <dig> and
 <dig>  there were  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas differentially expressed  by deseq and edger, respectively, and all these mirnas were identified by the fisher’s exact test . three out of eight mirnas by deseq analysis were also identified by edger. all mirnas identified by deseq were up-regulated with aiv infection. for the  <dig> mirnas identified by the edger program, nine mirnas specifically expressed in the infected chickens and one mirna in non-infected birds; two mirnas were up-regulated with aiv infection.

taqman mirna assays were used to confirm two differentially expressed mirnas identified by deep sequencing. there was general consistency between the taqman assays and deep sequence analysis of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in terms of direction of regulation and statistical significance . specifically, there was a  <dig>  fold up-regulation  in mir- <dig>  and  <dig>  fold down regulation  in mir- <dig> with aiv infection in lungs .

mirna target identification and validation
potential targets of differentially expressed mirnas were predicted by the mirna target prediction algorithm miranda  <dig> 
 <cit> . the entire list of immune target genes related to aiv infection is listed in additional file
2: table s <dig>  one hundred and seventy-one immune related genes were predicted to be targets of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas. each mirna can target hundreds of genes. we are especially interested in the targeted immune-related genes; some immune related genes each had several predicted mirna binding sites. for example, il- <dig> receptor d , has predicted binding sites for seven differentially expressed mirnas: gga-mir-30b, 34a, 142-5p,  <dig>  460b-5p, 449b, and 460a. interestingly, first five mirnas were up-regulated, while last two mirnas were down-regulated following aiv infection. this might explain why il- <dig> receptor d was not differentially expressed if these differentially expressed mirna regulate in different direction.

of particular note, gga-mir-146a is one of differentially expressed mirnas that was associated with virus infection in both broiler  and layer chickens
 <cit> . seven potential target genes  of gga-mir-146a were picked for the validation by a dual luciferase reporter assay. the results are shown in figure
 <dig>  the 3’ utr of five  out of the seven genes targeted by mir-146a showed significant suppression of renilla luciferase activity in rcas-mir-146a infected cells relative to those infected with rcas-sc . inhibition of the luciferase activity of significant targets varied between 65–85% amongst target sites.

note: * the 3’utr predicted target genes containing gga-mir-146a binding sites were cloned into the 3’utr of the psicheck- <dig> vector .

recent evidence indicates that cellular mirnas can also target viral genes
 <cit> . potential viral genes targeted by differentially expressed mirnas were predicted using vita program
 <cit> . all of the aiv genes were predicted to be targeted by at least one of up or down regulated mirnas . for example, the gga-mir-34a, which was only expressed in infected chicken lungs, not only had  <dig> immune related target genes , but also targeted the aiv ha, na, pa, pb <dig> and pb <dig> genes. in general, more aiv genes were targeted by induced host mirnas than repressed mirnas . some mirnas had only two viral targets, such as gga-mir- <dig>  and gga-mir-30b . some differentially expressed mirnas had multiple predicted viral targets, such as gga-mir- <dig> which is predicted to target all nine aiv genes.

host mrna profile analysis
the genome-wide expression profiling of host response to aiv infection was carried out using chicken  <dig> k agilent microarray. there were  <dig> genes differentially expressed  between aiv infected vs. non-infected chickens . the fold-change of gene expression between infected and non-infected group ranged from  <dig>  to − <dig> .

the integrative differentially expressed mirnas and mrna expression of its potential targeted immune-related genes are presented in table
 <dig>  eight immune related host genes were significantly up or down regulated with aiv infection. four genes were significantly up-regulated, while the rest were significantly down-regulated. chicken mx <dig> gene, which was reported to be associated with influenza virus resistance
 <cit> , had the highest fold-change  followed by interleukin 8
 <cit>   and interferon regulatory factory 7
 <cit>  . tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member  <dig> was down-regulated
 <cit>  . in general, positive correlations between mirnas and mrna expression were observed.

gene ontology  analysis
the significantly enriched functional terms in biological processes from differentially expressed host genes and predicted target genes of differentially expressed mirnas with aiv infection, respectively, are presented in additional file
3: table s <dig>  the immune related go terms are presented in figure
 <dig>  developmental process  was enriched by both target genes of repressed mirnas and induced mrnas. two immune related go terms, immune system process and immune response, were only enriched by induced host genes.

go terms significantly enriched in repressed genes included four clusters: cytoskeleton-dependent intracellular transport, dna unwinding during replication microtubule-based movement and response to dna damage stimulus. for go terms significantly enriched in targets of induced mirnas, five go terms were enriched. these included calcium ion transport; homophilic cell adhesion; t cell activation; gamma-aminobutyric acid signalling pathway; and wnt receptor signalling pathway.

discussion
integration of global profiling of mirnas and mrna expression may provide a unique opportunity in enhancing our understanding of regulatory mechanisms in many biological processes including virus infection. identification of differentially expressed mirnas associated with aiv infection is the first critical step of this comprehensive analysis. with limited number of biological replicates, and the nature of distribution of discrete measurement data other than continuous variable in microarray data, no single statistical method currently available can meet all conditions of this type of data
 <cit> . as the main purpose of this step was to narrow down a small set of differentially expressed mirnas that are potentially associated with aiv infection, our strategy was to include any potential important mirnas  for global enrichment analysis, but more conservative for further analysis for individual mirna. therefore, we chose three methods that have been intensively used for next generation sequencing data analysis
 <cit> , including fisher’s exact test, deseq and edger. based on the results, fisher’s exact test is less stringent than both deseq and edger. on the other hand, both deseq and edger might be too conservative. for example, gga-mir- <dig> was not identified by deseq, neither by edger, but it was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr. this did suggest that the criteria used in the deseq and edger analyses might miss some true positive, although this may exclude potential false positives. thus, for the following global functional term enrichment analysis, our analysis was primarily based on the results from fisher’s exact test. however, we are more interested in the  <dig> mirnas  that were identified as significant in at least two of the three methods of analysis, and especially the three mirnas  identified across all three analysis. of particular note, these three mirnas are chicken specific mirnas. to our knowledge, this is the first report of potential function study of these three mirnas in animals. further investigation of underlying mechanisms of these mirnas in regulating aiv replication will expand our knowledge in host-pathogen interaction in animals.

genetics play an important role in the regulation of mirnas expression in animals
 <cit> . we hypothesize that genetics affect the regulation of mirna expression during aiv infection in the chicken. in the present study with broiler chickens, there were more mirnas up-regulated than down-regulated with virus infection, which was the opposite with our previous mirna profiling in layer chickens with aiv infection 
 <cit> . table
 <dig> lists differentially expressed mirnas in both current broiler and previous layer studies. only two  of eighteen mirnas had consistent directions of regulation following aiv infection, which suggests that these two mirnas were conserved responses to aiv infection across diverse genetic lines. the major discrepancies between two studies might be due to: broilers and layers being genetically distinct chicken breeds with long-term diverse selection targeting on growth and egg production, respectively. specifically, broilers are specialized in the production of a short term humoral response, while layers have a long-term humoral response in combination with a strong cellular mediated response
 <cit> . the differential expression of mirnas between them may reflect different mirna-mediated host responses to virus infection. for example, differential expression of mir-142-3p in conventional cd4+ t cells and cd25+ treg cells in mice control the functions of both effector and suppressor cells. in the current study, gga-mir-142-3p was down-regulated in layers and up-regulated in broilers, which indicate that host immune response to aiv infection mediated by gga-mir-142-3p in broiler chickens may be different from layer. in summary, although other factors such as time of challenge may contribute to great mirna difference between broilers and layers, these results strongly suggest that genetic backgrounds play a vital role in the regulation of mirnas during aiv infection in chickens.

note: + specifically expressed in non-infected lungs.

the mir- <dig> has been reported to play important roles in both innate and adaptive immunity in mammals
 <cit> . mir- <dig> knock-out mice are not capable of generating defensive immune responses, developing lymphocytes, or antigen-presenting cell functions
 <cit> . the up-regulation of mir- <dig> with poly  and ifnβ stimulation in mouse macrophages suggest an important role of mir- <dig> in the regulation of viral infection
 <cit> . in the current study, gga-mir- <dig> was significantly induced by aiv infection, which was consistent with other studies
 <cit> . based on target prediction, mir- <dig> could target the chicken anti-influenza gene mx <dig>  therefore playing a role in host and aiv interactions in chickens. the activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinases  pathway can eliminate virus-infected cells by apoptosis. the inhibition of jnk pathway blocked the expression of mir- <dig> in murine macrophages
 <cit> . down-regulation of tnfrsf <dig> , one of key genes in jnk pathway, indicate that antiviral activities through jnk pathway might be inhibited. therefore, up-regulated mir- <dig> might also activate jnk pathway, and subsequently induce apoptosis to eliminate virus infected cells
 <cit> .

most of the up-regulated mirnas were predicted to target the hemaglutinin  and neuraminidase  mrnas such as mir-34a and mir- <dig>  both ha and na are major surface glycoproteins. ha is responsible for receptor binding and virus fusion
 <cit> , while na is responsible for receptor destruction and virion release
 <cit> . therefore, induction of these mirnas might affect virus attachment and release and therefore the formation of new infectious viral particles. in addition, three down-regulated mirnas  also were predicated to target on aiv genome. the first line of evidence from this integrative analysis strongly indicates that the importance of several candidate mirnas including mir-34a, 146a,  <dig> and  <dig> warrant further investigation to understand the mechanisms of mirna regulation of aiv infection in chickens.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this comprehensive analysis has provided several lines of new evidence on how host mirna might regulate host response to aiv replication in broilers. specifically, this study generated a list of strong candidate mirnas including mir-34a, 122– <dig>  122– <dig>  146a,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that potentially regulate aiv infection in chickens. in addition, several candidate genes including mx <dig>  il- <dig>  irf- <dig>  tnfrs <dig> have been identified to be associated with aiv infection in broilers. finally, comparison with our previous layer mirna profiling, this study strongly indicates that genetic background is a critical factor in determining mirna abundance and regulation during aiv infection. as main focus of this global profiling analysis was to generate new hypothesis by screening whole genome mirnas and mrnas, our on-going effort using experimental approach such as knock-down or over-express candidate mirnas and mrnas in vitro is expected to provide new evidence in understanding these regulatory mechanisms of aiv infection in chickens.
