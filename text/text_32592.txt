BACKGROUND
flowering plants have extensively and often recursively experienced polyploidization  <cit> . the resulting duplicated regions, especially those produced recently, offer the means to further study the contributions of segmental and/or whole-genome duplication/triplication to the evolution of a lineage, but add to genome complexity. the high abundance of repetitive dna sequences in some flowering plants adds further to genome complexity. at present, many plant genomes have been or are being sequenced. draft genome sequences can lack sufficient contiguity in many genomic regions to support cross-species comparison of genome organization and structure, which is crucial to understanding plant evolution and speciation. in concert with sequence assemblies, independent physical maps often facilitate the correct ordering of dna segments on chromosomes and thus clarify the genome organization changes revealed by multiple species comparisons  <cit> .

brassica is in the tribe brassiceae, a well-defined clade in the family brassicaceae that also includes arabidopsis thaliana, the source of the first flowering plant genome to be sequenced. brassica and arabidopsis are thought to have shared common ancestry ~14- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the genus brassica has great scientific and economic importance  <cit> . crops of the genus brassica are widely used in the cuisine of many cultures and provide much of world-wide edible vegetable oil supplies. six brassica species are widely cultivated, including three diploids: b. rapa , b. nigra  and b. oleracea , and three amphidiploids : b. juncea , b. napus  and b. carinata .

study of b. oleracea offers particularly great promise of new insights into morphological evolution that complement and extend upon what is available in arabidopsis  <cit> . in b. oleracea, morphological divergence has been unusually rapid relative to reproductive isolation, i.e., this single species has a stunning range of morphologies among genotypes that are readily intercrossed. while domestication of most crops resulted in enhancement of a single plant part for use by humans, such as the seeds/grains of cereal crops, the fruits of some trees, or the roots of some vegetable crops, the b. oleracea crops are a striking exception. they include forms that have been selected for enlarged vegetative meristems at the apex  or in the leaf axils , forms with proliferation of floral meristems  or even aborted floral meristems , and forms with swollen bulbous stems , or orate leaf patterns . these morphologically divergent genotypes  are freely intercrossing.

the plasticity of b. oleracea makes it a potential model for the study of plant morphological evolution in much the same manner that the dog  is an attractive model for mammalian evolution. while a few genes like the homologs of arabidopsis mutants such as "cauliflower" are thought to play roles in some brassica morphologies  <cit> , these morphologies are under complex genetic control  <cit> . some brassica qtls map to locations that correspond to relevant arabidopsis mutants, suggesting positional candidates -- but many do not, suggesting the opportunity to identify functions recalcitrant to mutation in arabidopsis  <cit>  or that escaped detection due to small phenotypic effects  <cit> .

due to their close phylogenetic relationship, brassica-arabidopsis comparative genomics promises to identify genetic determinants of a much broader spectrum of variation than might be accessible using arabidopsis alone  <cit> . the close relationship of brassica to arabidopsis motivated nsf-funded low-coverage  sequencing of b. oleracea  genotype to  <dig>  <cit> . however, while the physiology and developmental biology of arabidopsis and brassica are similar, the genomes of brassica species are much more complex than that of a. thaliana  <cit> . the 'diploid' brassica genomes are 3- <dig> times larger than that of arabidopsis, ranging from  <dig>  pg/2c  for b. nigra to  <dig>  pg/2c  for b. oleracea, partially as a result of multiple rounds of polyploidy during their ancestry  <cit> . one round of ancient whole-genome triplication  in an early eudicot ancestor and two whole-genome duplications  occurred before the arabidopsis-brassica split  <cit> . additional polyploidization occurred in the brassica lineage after its divergence from arabidopsis, reflected by large duplicated segments in the genetic maps of each of three diploids   <cit> . the corresponding duplicated structure of the b. rapa and b. oleracea maps indicates that species divergence was after polyploidization, resulting whole-genome triplication  <cit> . it was estimated that the genome triplication event and the initial diversification of the brassiceae must have occurred between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya  <cit> , which might be the hypothesized single and major evolutionary event that have gave rise to the early lineages  <cit> . according to the analysis of the flowering locus c region, it was further estimated that the brassica triplication occurred  <dig> to  <dig> mya, very soon after the arabidopsis and brassica divergence at 17- <dig> mya  <cit> .

significant progress has been made in developing genomic resources to expedite brassica research  <cit> . a detailed genetic linkage map of b. rapa has been constructed containing  <dig> sequence-tagged loci distributed on  <dig> linkage groups covering  <dig> cm, with an average interval of  <dig>  cm between markers  <cit> . genetic linkage maps were constructed for four b. oleracea populations, with an average length of  <dig>  cm and a total of  <dig> loci were detected in the constructed composite map with an average interval between loci of  <dig>  cm  <cit> , which revealed at least  <dig> chromosomal rearrangements differentiating b. oleracea and arabidopsis. linkage maps of immortal mapping populations of rapid cycling, self-compatible lines from b. rapa and b. oleracea were recently developed, which included  <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively  <cit> . a genome-wide physical map of the b. rapa genome was constructed by high-information-content fingerprinting   <cit> , which facilitates improved physical map construction in both throughput and quality by exploiting the fluorescence-labeled finger-printing approach. the map provided  <dig> anchored contigs on  <dig> linkage groups to serve as seed points from which to continue bidirectional chromosome extension for genome sequencing. there are also efforts to refine genetic linkage maps. genome sequencing projects involving "a" and "c" genomes are on-going or planned  <cit> . the multinational brassica genome project  and brassica rapa genome sequencing project  are aiming to completely sequence the genome of brassica rapa inbred line 'chiifu" .

here we report a physical map of a rapid-cycling strain of b. oleracea , integrating high-information-content fingerprinting  of bacterial artificial chromosome  clones with overgo hybridization data from  <dig> probes, including about  <dig> that have been genetically mapped. by integrating the b. rapa physical map, we explored genome-wide microsynteny between arabidopsis and brassica, and found probable centromere-related contigs. comparison of the b. oleracea map with arabidopsis and other available eudicot genomes showed appreciable 'shadowing' produced by more ancient polyploidies, resulting in a web of relatedness among contigs which increased genomic complexity, and interchromosomal breakpoints during their diversification. this physical map is of immediate value for gene isolation, and will serve as a valuable genomic resource for brassica "c" genome sequencing, assembly of bac sequences and further comparative genomics between brassica genomes.

RESULTS
bac fingerprinting and physical map assembly
we fingerprinted a total of  <dig> clones from  <dig> 384-well plates. fingerprints containing less than  <dig> and more than  <dig> bands were excluded from fpc analysis, which used a dataset of  <dig> clones.

fpc   <cit>  was used to construct bac contigs. to produce an fpc-accessible dataset , the size of each fragment was multiplied by  <dig>  after which the decimal part was dropped. this resulted in fragments with sizes ranging from  <dig> to <  <dig> units. secondly, the color labels were converted to non-overlapping numeric ranges by adding offset values  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> to three of the four colors, which eventually resulted in fragments ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> units.

we designed and used overgo hybridization probes to support contig construction. a total of  <dig> probes were designed by using arabidopsis and brassica sequences, and they are often from conservative domains . after removing the probes that hit >  <dig> bac clones, a subset of  <dig> probes were involved in the physical map assembly process.

well-to-well contamination produces many problems during assembly of hicf data. therefore, before running fpc to construct the contigs, we removed the likely contaminated bacs in the dataset by implementing a de-contamination function in fpc. after an initial round of contig construction , a fpc program named dqer was run to eliminate possible questionable clones  for contigs > 15% q-clones. multiple iterations of end-to-end and singleton-to-contig merges were then adopted with successively less and less stringent settings .

during the optimization of our processes, and later to improve quality of some below-average batches of bacs, we repeated fingerprinting of some 96-well 'subplates', with  <dig> subplates  duplicated, and  <dig> subplates  triplicated. for each bac repeated, the fingerprint having numbers of bands nearest the global average  was used in assembly.

a total of  <dig>  bacs were used in contig assembly, yielding  <dig> contigs each containing  <dig> or more bacs, and  <dig> singletons. an average contig contained  <dig>  bacs and  <dig>  overgo probes. two contigs  contain more than  <dig> bacs, ~60% of whose end sequences could be linked to brassica repetitive sequences determined by running blast. five contigs contained more than  <dig> bacs. sixteen contigs  are rna-related, and may help to decipher the rrna and trna genes in brassica. six contigs  are likely chloroplast-related, and five contigs  are likely mitochondrion-related, including two contigs that are both chloroplast- and mitochondrion-related. these contigs may be chimeric, involving both nuclear and organelle dna, or just nuclear dna produced by lateral gene transfer from organelle to nucleus as previously discussed in arabidopsis  <cit> , and sorghum  <cit> . dna similarity between bess and organelle dna can provide some clue about the identity of potentially chimeric contigs: bess from chimeric contigs may have high identity with organelle dna, e.g., dna similarity > 98% over a long stretch, while laterally transferred dna may not. we infer that ctg <dig>  may be a chimeric contig of chloroplast dna  and nuclear dna . the dna similarity of most involved bess against chloroplast dna are often > 99% in up to  <dig> bp, but some bess have dna similarity < 95%, perhaps reflecting a mix of extant chloroplast dna and laterally transferred ones. we also suggest that ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> are chimeric mitochondrion-nuclear contigs inferred based on similar criteria. the latter contains most mitochrondrial bacs . bess of other organelle-related contigs have low similarity with extant organelle dna, suggesting their origins by lateral gene transfer.

comparative genomic analysis
with the help of bac end sequences and probe sequences, both b. oleracea and b. rapa contigs were mapped onto the arabidopsis genome sequence . neighboring hits < =  <dig> kb from one another were used to infer dna synteny between b. oleracea and arabidopsis, and the longest syntenic region inferred is more than  <dig> kb, with most regions less than  <dig> kb . for anchoring b. rapa contigs to arabidopsis, the extension parameter was reduced to  <dig> kb because a higher density of bess made it easier to find cross-species synteny. a subset of  <dig> b. oleracea and  <dig> b. rapa contigs  hit one or more arabidopsis regions. dna sequence similarity revealed by the anchor sequences peaked at 92% , which supports a  <dig> - <dig>  million year divergence time between arabidopsis and brassica  <cit> . interestingly, the blast e-value showed a bi-modal distribution , which may imply at least two different sets of anchored regions in arabidopsis, possibly reflecting the ancient duplication events.

we found clear evidence of ancient duplication events in the extant brassica genomes. about 88% and 93% of arabidopsis genome sequences have been covered by the anchored b. oleracea and b. rapa contigs, respectively . at least 70% of regions have been covered to a depth > =  <dig>  surely a result of multiple homologous regions in brassica . the peak is around  <dig>  covering nearly 20-25% of arabidopsis genome sequences. there is a sharp decrease from coverage  <dig> to  <dig>  supporting previous propositions of triplication of at least portions of the brassica ancestral genome after its divergence from arabidopsis. the 13% of the arabidopsis genome covered in depth  <dig>  and total of 20% covered in depths > =  <dig>  are shown below to be partly explained by the 'shadows' of more ancient genome duplications.

by checking arabidopsis genomic regions known to correspond to one another due to ancient duplication, we revealed that  <dig> b. oleracea contigs  were anchored to both members of α-duplicated segment pairs and another  <dig>  to β- or γ-duplicated regions. however, it is often possible to distinguish the orthologous regions from the outparalogous regions . the inferred arabidopsis-brassica orthologous regions always share blastn e-values < 1e- <dig>  while the outparalogous regions share e-values ~ 1e- <dig>  excluding the identified outparalogous regions from evaluation made the peak around coverage depth  <dig> and  <dig> even more prominent , and the higher coverage-depth portion of arabidopsis became smaller.

dna breakages distinguishing brassica and arabidopsis
to locate dna breakages distinguishing the two species, we divided arabidopsis chromosomes into 'bins', which were further linked to brassica bess to find multiple associations of bins with different bess. in total, we found  <dig> synteny discontinuities between the two lineages , with  <dig> that imply interchromosomal rearrangements, and  <dig> that imply intra-chromosomal rearrangements. we identified tens of cases in which paired bac ends fell in different duplicated regions. this added to the credibility of the analysis by showing that the approach finds actual associations in that the duplicated regions possibly share appreciable sequence similarity.

heterochromatin vs. euchromatin
the chromosomal distribution of conserved arabidopsis-brassica synteny was striking, preserved almost universally in gene rich and repeat poor regions presumably representing the arabidopsis euchromatin, and almost absent from the heterochromatin or pericentromeric regions . about 14% of arabidopsis sequences were not covered by b. oleracea contigs, occurring mainly in the pericentromeric regions . among  <dig> anchored b. oleracea contigs , 97%  could be aligned to the  <dig> mb euchromatic regions in arabidopsis, involving 80%  of anchored probes, which may correspond to low-copy-number genes in brassica, and 91%  of anchored bacs. in contrast, only  <dig> % of contigs, 20% of anchored probes and 9% of anchored bacs aligned to the  <dig> mb heterochromatic regions. about 3% of b. oleracea contigs can be anchored to both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions.

a total of  <dig> b. oleracea contigs that could not be aligned to arabidopsis were hypothesized to be pericentromere-related, based on four lines of evidence. first, these contigs were gene-scarce, accounting for 33% of total contigs but less than 1%  of gene-derived probes. second, these 33% of contigs account for only 16% of bacs, indicating that the underlying bacs are relatively recalcitrant to assembly, consistent with low dna sequence complexity resulting from high repetitive dna content. third, 46% of the bacs were repeat-related based on their end-sequences , the same as those aligned to the arabidopsis heterochromatin and much higher than the 34% of bacs aligned to the euchromatin . fourth, we searched the bes against two brassica-centromere-specific repeats , and found that non-anchored contigs had a similar abundance of centromeric elements  as known heterochromatin-aligned contigs , and much more than euchromatin-aligned contigs . accordingly, many of the non-anchored contigs may be centromeric.

ribosomal-rna-related contigs correspond mainly to two pericentromeric regions on arabidopsis chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  showing possible expansion of their related orthologous copies in brassica. the regions covered to the greatest depths are not rna-related but possibly related to other repeats like transposons.

evolution of centromeric repeats
identified first in b. rapa  <cit> , we found thousands of centbr <dig> and centbr <dig> repeat sequences in the bess from both b. oleracea and b. rapa, which permitted us to perform a comparative analysis of their evolution. we hereafter refer to them as centb <dig> and centb <dig>  since they are not confined to b. rapa. a subset of  <dig> and  <dig> b. oleracea bess, or 2% of the total, are centb1- and centb2-related, respectively. many b. rapa bess  were also related to these elements, and showed unbalanced relatedness to the two repeat classes, with  <dig> and  <dig> bess related to two classes, respectively. about 50% of the bacs in both species were related to the same repeat class at both ends, while only a small fraction  were related to different elements at each end, suggesting a relatively separate distribution and expansion of the two element families in the brassica genomes.

from the bess we retrieved  <dig> and  <dig> sequences of the two centromeric repeat classes and randomly selected  <dig> b. oleracea sequences and  <dig> b. rapa sequences for phylogenetic analysis . as expected, the centb <dig> repeats grouped together, forming a subtree in which repeats from each species form two subgroups, each clustered with repeats from the other species. this illustrates the separate divergence and expansion of family members in each species. the centb <dig> repeats from the two species are much more interleaved with one another, though forming many clusters and showing separate expansion. this phylogenetic distribution suggests a clear origination and initial divergence of these repeat families in a rapa-oleracea common ancestor. possible cross-species gene transfer cannot be ruled out due to the existence of many subgroups containing genes from both species.

discussion
recursive polyploidizations and subsequent changes
brassica provides an attractive system in which to study polyploidy and its consequences, having been affected by recursive polyploidizations including γ triplication in a common ancestor of most if not all rosids, β  and α  duplications in the brassicales after divergence from papaya, triplication  in the brassica oleracea and b. rapa common ancestor, and very recent duplications to form b. juncea , b. napus , and b. carinata . these provide good opportunities to study the relationship between speciation and genome doubling/tripling.

genome macro-structural changes during lineage evolution can be enormous, but the types and rates of change differ widely among lineages. for example, the chromosome numbers of tetraploid brassica species are the sum of the chromosome numbers of their parental diploids, showing no significant chromosomal changes after genome doubling. in contrast, there have been about  <dig> chromosomal fissions, fusions and merges in the a. thaliana lineage since its divergence from a. lyrata, the latter still showing near-perfect collinearity with a member of a different genus, capsella rubella  <cit> . genomic resources in preparation for an outgroup, sisymbrium irio, may soon make it possible to deduce the levels and patterns of change in the diploid brassicas since their divergence.

gene losses after the brassica triplication event have been very extensive. one chromosome segment from the rosid common ancestor would be represented in  <dig> copies through sequential episodes of two whole-genome triplications and two whole-genome duplications  in the b. oleracea  genomes if all doubled/tripled copies had been preserved, with such a genome containing more than  <dig> genes. the angiosperm genomes sequenced to date are estimated to have about  <dig> to  <dig> protein-coding genes, with the largest set of predicted gene models from soybean   <cit> . all these genomes have been affected by  <dig> to  <dig> whole-genome duplications like brassica. therefore, the brassica genomes must have preserved only a small fraction of duplicated genes, as reported previously  <cit> . the physical map reveals a clear impact of these recursive duplications on genome complexity, with a web of syntenic patterns among paleo-duplicated regions upon which the relatively recent triplication is superimposed, making the genome complicated to decipher.

comparative analysis of b. napus and a. thaliana, has been proposed to define  <dig> genomic blocks in the ancestral brassica karyotype   <cit> . these blocks were used to delineate the genome of b. rapa with each block in 1- <dig> copies, revealing ~ <dig> major rearrangements during the evolution of b. rapa from the ancestral karyotype. our present analysis likewise suggests  <dig> synteny discontinuities between b. oleracea and a. thaliana genome sequences. since the genomic structure of arabidopsis has been affected only by several major rearrangements  <cit> , we predict that many of these synteny discontinuities occurred during the evolution of b. oleracea and its close ancestors, perhaps mostly during a period of genomic instability shortly after the lineage-specific whole-genome triplication. a similar analysis was performed by mapping b. rapa bac clones onto the a. thaliana genome, inferring  <dig> inter-chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> .

synteny preservation and recombination
most b. oleracea and b. rapa contigs and bacs, including the majority of low-copy dna hybridization probes, could be anchored to the arabidopsis euchromatin. despite this synteny preserved between brassica and arabidopsis euchromatin after 15- <dig> mya of divergent evolution, pericentromeric regions tacitly assumed to be heterochromatic appear substantially rearranged, as few contigs can be anchored. repetitive and centromeric probes are enriched in the few contigs anchored here as well as many non-anchored contigs, suggesting that the latter belong here too. not only is cross-species synteny better preserved in euchromatin, but paralogous dna synteny produced by whole-genome duplications also remains more evident . indeed, the depth of coverage of the arabidopsis genome by brassica bac contigs increases with distance from the arabidopsis pericentromeric space. an attractive future study would be to compare on a nucleotide-for-nucleotide basis the entire centromeric regions of arabidopsis and brassica chromosomes, perhaps revealing small islands that are preserved by selection acting on key functions

the arabidopsis-brassica comparison provides further support for a model of genome evolution that has arisen from comparison of the monocots rice and sorghum  <cit>  and is also supported by analysis of the soybean sequence  <cit> . specifically, synteny preservation is high and repetitive dna abundance is low in genomic regions where recombination is relatively frequent. in sorghum, very recent ltr retroelement insertions are approximately evenly distributed across the entire genome, while older insertions are largely in the heterochromatin  <cit> . considering these data in view of muller's ratchet  <cit> , one would predict most rearrangements to be slightly deleterious, in that gene arrangement appears to be much more strongly preserved in recombinogenic than non-recombinogenic regions such as pericentromeric space  <cit> .

the extensive duplicated regions in brassica genomes provide much opportunity for illegitimate recombination, which could lead to reciprocal  or nonreciprocal  dna information transfer, or homeologous nonreciprocal transposition  <cit> . illegitimate recombination is often deleterious, incurring dna mutations, deletions, and inversions. gene conversion can be explained as a "copy and paste" process, which removes the information of one dna segment but doubles the effect of its homologous segment, leading to changes in expression dosage. illegitimate recombination has a much greater chance to occur between relatively young duplicated blocks  <cit> , or to recur between ancient blocks that are kept very similar by its recurrence  <cit> . different lines of cytological evidence show that exchanges can occur between homeologous chromosomes of both resynthesized and natural b. napus  <cit> . though the brassica triplication event may have occurred as much as  <dig> mya  <cit> , evidence from rice-sorghum comparison supports illegitimate recombination between  <dig> million-year-old duplicated regions. indeed, intragenomic study of rice shows that 70-my old duplicated regions have interacted as recently as the past  <dig>  years  <cit> . therefore, another important future study, when the required data are available, will be to investigate the impact of illegitimate recombination on the evolution of brassica genes, genomes, and species.

toward sequencing brassica oleracea
recursive polyploidizations may complicate assembly of brassica genome sequences, especially if they are accompanied by frequent illegitimate recombination events that render 'islands' of paralogous dna sequence  homogeneous. based on our findings herein and those in previous publications, there are many duplicated blocks, making brassica genomes very complex to decipher. though the frequency of homeologous recombination per generation is very low  <cit> , its cumulative effect over many generations may be high. gene conversion or homeologous dna translocation could keep two homeologous dna segments very similar, misleading efforts to reconstruct the evolutionary history of genes or genomic structures.

the physical map described herein, genetically anchored and rich in landmarks such as bac end sequences and hybridization data to genetically-mapped markers, provides a valuable adjunct to efforts in progress to sequence the rapid-cycling genotype from which the bacs were made. moreover, efforts are also in progress to investigate the genomic basis of the remarkable morphological diversity among cultivated forms that distinguishes b. oleracea from any other plant species we are aware of. the bacs provide an excellent bridge between the resolution that might be accomplished by qtl fine mapping  <cit> , and the identification of determinant genes.

based on the physical map of b. oleracea, we have done a very preliminary comparative genomics analysis with several eudicot plants. the future availability of whole-genome sequences from brassica species will further expand scope for comparative analysis and shed light on both genome-level and single-gene-level changes that have contributed to the evolutionary trajectory of brassica.

CONCLUSIONS
a genetically-anchored, sequence-rich physical map for b. oleracea sheds light on genome evolution of brassicaceae species, and provides a valuable resource toward the assembly of genome sequences, especially using recent short-read technologies.
