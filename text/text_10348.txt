BACKGROUND
the four serotypes of dengue virus  belong to the genus flavivirus within the family flaviviridae <cit> . the clinical manifestations of denv infections cover a wide range of symptoms, from mild dengue fever  to severe life threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever  and dengue shock syndrome   <cit> . commonly, dhf/dss is associated with sequential denv infection by different serotypes  <cit> . annually,  <dig> to  <dig> million people in over  <dig> countries are infected with denv and dhf/dss can be fatal in up to 5% of affected individuals. no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs is currently available.

denv is a typical positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus. the genome is about 11 kb in length and encodes three structural proteins  and seven non-structural proteins . neutralizing antibody is predominantly induced against e protein, and laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that protection of animals or individuals from denv infection is best correlated to titer of neutralizing antibody . however, pre-existing sub-neutralizing concentration of antibody or non-neutralizing antibody was also evidenced to enhance denv infection in fc gamma receptor  - positive cells and appears to be a risk factor for severe diseases. this phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement  infection  <cit> . thus, human antibodies are believed to play distinct roles in controlling denv infection. it is important to characterize antibody with neutralizing or enhancing activities against denv for both basic and applied research.

currently, plaque-based analysis is the most widely accepted method measuring neutralizing or enhancing antibodies  <cit>  and has been recommended by the world health organization. however, this traditional method is time-consuming and labor intensive, and not suitable for large-scale samples analysis. further, plaque-based assay can only be performed in cells that permit plaque forming and quantified by an operator-error prone manual readout based on the number of plaques. there is a great need of novel technology for characterizing dnev neutralizing and enhancing antibodies in a simple, rapid, and high-throughput manner  <cit> .

recently, we have developed a stable luciferase reporter denv  for antiviral high-throughput screening  <cit> . in this study, we aim to adapt the luc-denv for anti-dnev neutralizing and enhancing antibodies evaluation. this newly developed reporter virus-based assay is validated using various known monoclonal antibodies  and clinical samples from infected animal and patients, demonstrating well correlation with the traditional plaque-based assays.

RESULTS
development of luc-based neutralizing assay
the luc-denv was developed by engineering the renilla luciferase gene into the capsid-coding region by reverse genetic technology  <cit> . we have shown that luc-denv replicates efficiently in both mammalian and mosquito cells with high stability. as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig>  increasing amounts of luciferase signal were observed from  <dig> to 96 h post-infection in luc-denv infected bhk- <dig> and k <dig> cells.

to adapt luc-denv for neutralizing assay, we firstly assayed three identified neutralizing mabs 4g <dig>  <cit> , 2b <dig>  <cit>  and 2a10g <dig>  <cit>  by using plaque-based and luc-based assay, respectively. standard prnt was performed in 12-well plates using 10-fold dilution of each mab. the results showed that all three mabs significantly reduced the numbers of plaques in a dose-dependent manner . the prnt <dig> of 4g <dig>  2b <dig> and 2a10g <dig> was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. the rlu based assay was performed in the 12-well plate using the same dilutions of each mab. the results demonstrated that all three mabs significantly decreased rlu in a dose-dependent manner . lrnt <dig> of three mabs calculated from a fitting curve were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively, which was of the same order of magnitude with prnt <dig>  an unrelated mab against ev <dig> showed no neutralization for both plaque and luc-based assay . data fitting was made between values above. as expected, a linear correlation  was demonstrated between pfu and rlu assay, and the linear equation between rlu and pfu is calculated as rlu =  <dig>  pfu +  <dig> . our results supported the application of luc-based assay for neutralization antibodies against denv.

development of luc-based ade assay
to develop the luc-denv for ade assay, k <dig> cells were infected with luc-denv in the presence of serial 10-fold dilutions of 2a10g <dig>  the viral titers in the supernatants were measured by standard plaque-based assay and rlu-based assay, respectively. the results showed that the viral yield was markedly enhanced in the presence of 2a10g <dig> at dilutions ranging from 100 μg/ml to  <dig>  μg/ml, and the peak enhancing was  <dig> -fold at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml . the rlu assay showed similar pattern of enhancing, and the peak enhancing was  <dig> -fold at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml , of the similar magnitude with plaque based assay. to get a linear equation between rlu and pfu, the results obtained with 2a10g <dig> were plotted on a scatter graph . as expected, the enhancing antibody titer determined by rlu was linear correlated to pfu , and the linear equation between rlu and pfu obtained was rlu =  <dig> pfu +  <dig>  similar to the neutralizing equation. together, these results indicated that this novel reporter system using luc-denv is readily for antibody neutralizing and enhancing assay with equivalent reliability to the conventional pfu-based assays.

validate the use of the assay with clinical samples
finally, this rlu based assay was validated with clinical samples from immunized monkeys and patients. neutralization assays were performed using 2-fold serial dilution sera in bhk- <dig> cells. for enhancing assay, sera were 10-fold serial dilution and assay was performed in k <dig> cells. sera from rhesus monkeys  immunized with a live attenuated denv- <dig> showed strong neutralizing activity, and lrnt <dig> was calculated to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . negative control  from healthy monkey showed no neutralizing activity as expected. luc-based enhancement assay showed that both sera from immunized monkeys could significantly enhanced luc-denv replication at dilutions from 2 × 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> , and 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> , respectively. the enhancing activity of # <dig> is higher than that of # <dig>  no enhancement was observed for #ns as expected .

three convalescent sera from df patients  were validated with the newly developed assay in k <dig> cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  all three samples were able to enhance denv infection at dilutions from 2 × 10- <dig> to10- <dig> , 10- <dig> to10- <dig> , and 10- <dig> to10- <dig> , respectively. negative control  from healthy adult in varying dilutions showed no impact on rlu as expected. meanwhile, serum #19- <dig> and #37- <dig> showed strong neutralizing activities at a dilution of 10- <dig> or even lower, and lrnt <dig> was calculated to  <dig> and 10-fold dilution separately, whereas no neutralizing activity can be observed in serum #37- <dig> at detected dilutions. together, these results indicate that the luc-based assay is suitable for detecting both neutralization and ade activity of immune sera from vaccinated or infected individuals.

discussion
a reliable, rapid, and high-throughput assay for denv neutralization antibodies is critical for laboratory and clinical studies of denv infection and vaccine. considering the limitations of plaque based assay, some novel methods for neutralizing assays have been described  <cit> . che and coworkers recently developed a novel elispot based neutralization test, demonstrating a well correlation with the conventional prnt assay  <cit> . pseudo infectious denv reporter virus particles  carrying green fluorescent protein  reporter were also used to measure neutralization antibodies with rapidity, stability and reproducibility  <cit> . infection with rvp could be monitored by the gfp signals using flow cytometry. however, gfp is not suitable for real-time quantification, and production of rvp requires special cell lines and replicon based plasmids. live reporter virus carrying luciferase reporter replicates almost the same as wild type virus, representing a more advanced tool. many reporter viruses, including sars-related corona virus, human hepatitis c virus, parainfluenza virus, hiv, adenovirus, have been described and well applied for antiviral screening, live imaging, or function studies  <cit> . live reporter denv engineering a reporter gene at the capsid gene has been developed  <cit> . recently, we described the stable luciferase denv reporter virus luc-denv and used it for high-throughput screening for antiviral drugs  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated the utility of luc-denv for measuring neutralization and enhancing antibodies. using three identified neutralizing mabs, luc-based assay showed well correlation with the prnt-based assay. 4g <dig> and 2b <dig> are both igg <dig> isotype mabs, and 2a10g <dig> belongs to igg2a isotype. 2b <dig> recognizes the domain iii of denv e protein and inhibit viral binding, while 2a10g <dig> and 4g <dig> inhibit fusion. all three mabs were active in inhibiting plaque forming and luc expression in luc-dnev infected vero cells. the value of prnt <dig> and lrnt <dig> are well correlated . the luc-based assay was readily applied in evaluation of clinical samples from vaccinated animals and infected patients.

ade infection of denv has been well demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and represents one of the major impediments against vaccine development. previously, different methods based on infection rate  <cit> , progeny viral yield  <cit> , and number of infectious centers  <cit>  have been reported to measure the ade activity in fcr expressing cells including k <dig>  u <dig> or thp- <dig> cells. the facs analysis has been commonly used to quantify the infection rate in c6/ <dig> cells, raji b, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit> . progeny viral yield can be detected either by conventional plaque assay or ns1-based elisa  <cit> , elispot  <cit> , and real-time rt-pcr  <cit> . recently, moi et al. <cit>  successfully established stable bhk- <dig> cell lines that express fcriia, which facilitate both neutralization and ade assay.

the plaque based assay determined the infectious particles released from virus-infected cells, whereas the rlu based assay described in this study offered a simple method which detected viral protein expression in cells. linear correlation was established between the two assays for both neutralization and ade assays . the newly developed assay method is comparable to the traditional plaque assay, with some unique advantages. first, this luc-based assay is more substantial and time saving. the conventional plaque test used 12-well plates and 5–7 days observation for the plaque forming, the new test is compared performing the same protocol involved 24-well plates and cost no more than 2 days. second, this new assay method has a more wide-range scope of application with high repetitiveness and reliability. luc-denv replicates well in multiple cells including bhk- <dig>  k <dig>  vero and thp- <dig> and a <dig> cells, and luciferase activity can also be detected stably in various cells. neutralization and ade assays can be performed in the same cells  <cit> . third, this new assay method is easy to adapt for a high-throughput manner  <cit> , which is of critical importance for large-scale clinical samples assays during clinical trials of dengue vaccine.

CONCLUSIONS
together, we establish a novel reporter system for neutralizing and enhancing antibody assay against denv by using an engineered denv stably expressing renilla luciferase. the newly developed assay described here is rapid, low-cost, and time-saving, providing a useful tool for both basic research and epidemiological investigation.
