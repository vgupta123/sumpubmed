BACKGROUND
success of early f <dig> hybrid maize varieties exemplifies the advantages of heterosis  <cit> . the use of doubled haploids as parents for f <dig> variety production fully exploits this phenomenon and has enabled substantial yield improvements in several crops  <cit> . this strategy was outlined with the first dh crop variety  <cit>  and has led to h/dh production systems being described for >  <dig> species  <cit> . however, few of these protocols generate the large numbers of hs/dhs needed for commercial breeding, with just three methods  routinely adopted for h/dh production in only  <dig> species  <cit> . the most important of these methods in widespread use in commercial breeding is the generation of haploids in maize via pollination with a haploid inducing line such as a 'stock 6' derivative. desire for a more generic h/dh production system to improve agricultural yields is increasing as population growth, climate change, biofuel demand and other land-use pressures intensify. clearly, in any species the production of f <dig> varieties depends not only on the production of homozygous lines to act as parents, but also it requires an efficient method to intercross the parents. this latter procedure is relatively simple in species with an outcrossing breeding system, like maize or oil palm, compared with those with an inbreeding system like rice or wheat. production of f <dig> hybrids has been achieved successfully in this category of crops  but often requires a male sterility system.

annually, oil palm  yields eight to ten times more oil per hectare than rapeseed or soybean  <cit>  and in  <dig> generated  <dig>  million tonnes of oil worldwide  <cit> . the area assigned to the crop expanded ~ <dig>  fold between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit>  with further increases forecast. over this same period global production of palm oil increased ~ <dig>  fold from  <dig> to  <dig>  mt y- <dig>  thus, yield increases have been achieved predominantly by expansion of cultivated area and not through yield enhancement. this trend raises concerns over the ecological impact of felling rainforest to accommodate oil palm cultivation  <cit>  and has stimulated debate over strategies to limit further agricultural expansion  <cit> . one option explored here is to use market forces to help address the problem. if f <dig> varieties could increase yields sufficiently to exceed demand, commodity prices would fall. this would discourage clear felling and simultaneously incentivise early replacement of existing plantations with high-yielding varieties. feasibility of the approach clearly relies on the ability to gain marked improvements in yield. current yields of oil palm   <cit>  are much lower than the most conservative estimates of the crop's potential . indeed, yields per hectare in the two largest producer countries  have remained static for  <dig> years  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that in both these countries there are examples of selected varieties with much higher yields, with the highest yields from commercial breeding trials already exceeding  <dig> t ha- <dig> 

to date, a h/dh-derived f <dig> breeding approach has been precluded by the repeated failure to secure h/dhs via anther or microspore culture  <cit>  and successful generation of h/dhs in oil palm is unreported in the literature. the report of a spontaneous h in the related coconut palm  <cit>  and in other species  <cit>  nevertheless gave hope that spontaneous hs may also occur in oil palm. however, the characteristically rare occurrence of spontaneous h/dhs necessitates development of an effective high-throughput screening system. phenotypic characteristics of h/dh  could be used for diagnosis but are difficult to score qualitatively on a large scale and require plants of a reasonable size. an alternative strategy is to seek undefined atypical phenotypic features that may arise from reduced cell size and/or the hemizygous state of haploid individuals  and that are manifest at the seedling stage when high-throughput visual assessment is more plausible. a more directed approach is also possible. spontaneous h/dh seedlings are often associated with aberrant germination features, such as twin embryos from the same carpel  <cit> , providing a defined feature for phenotypic selection. here, we combined a large-scale visual survey for undefined atypical palm seedling phenotypes coupled with active selection for seeds with twin embryos to assemble a sub-population of seedlings enriched for h/dhs.

RESULTS
over two years, we performed two large-scale screens for morphological 'off-types' among oil palm seedlings generated by the bah lias research station, indonesia. the first screen utilised  <dig> , <dig> seedlings from a wide range of crosses and identified  <dig>  morphological 'off-types' , of which  <dig> had twin embryos and  <dig>  were phenotypically abnormal . the second screen of approximately  <dig> , <dig> seedlings from commercial seed production activities and approximately  <dig> , <dig> seedlings from breeding experiments generated  <dig>  h/dh candidates, of which  <dig>  were phenotypically abnormal and  <dig> had twin embryos. more than  <dig>  of these seedlings  were transferred to the nursery prior to further screening. although hs could be identified relatively easily on the basis of their reduced genome size, we initially wished to target the more difficult, but more valuable dhs to circumvent the need for chromosome doubling. for the second level screen, we exploited the fact that hs and dhs would be either hemi- or homozygous across all loci; thus individuals exhibiting heterozygosity at any locus could be discarded. applying this logic, we performed a sequential screen using 9- <dig> microsatellite markers  on all individuals and found  <dig> seedlings that exhibited a single allele across all loci . these individuals were retained as candidate h/dh, and subsequent flow cytometry of leaf samples identified  <dig> as h, and  <dig> as diploid . the haploid status of six palms was further confirmed by cytological examination of intact cells from root squashes. each contained the expected  <dig> chromosomes .

markers 10- <dig> obtained from billotte et al.  <cit> .

note: in this initial round, no dh was found. the dh  was detected in a subsequent batch.

a larger-scale survey for heterozygosity was then performed using  <dig> additional microsatellites  to confirm absolute hemizygosity of hs and identify 'false' candidate dhs showing any heterozygosity. all hs produced single-allele peak profiles across all microsatellites, thereby discounting fixed heterozygosity via locus duplication for all markers used. all diploids were heterozygous at several loci and so discarded. however, one diploid  identified from a later screen  was homozygous across all  <dig> mapped loci found to be heterozygous in the maternal parent . taking account of linkage between mapped markers, the probability of such an individual occurring by chance following selfing was  <dig>  Ã— 10- <dig> . this palm was therefore deemed a spontaneous dh.

these initial screens collectively revealed  <dig> spontaneous hs but no dhs , with the undirected phenotypic 'off-type' selection proving substantially more effective than screening for twin embryos. this result suggests that our method could be used to secure large numbers of hs but is less able to isolate dhs at useful frequencies. this finding, when coupled with the routine nature of h chromosome doubling in other crops  <cit> , suggested the most promising route for commercial dh production lay in the isolation of hs followed by somatic doubling. in subsequent screening of abnormal seedlings, high-throughput flow cytometry therefore replaced molecular analysis for candidate h identification. haploid identity was then supported using at least  <dig> microsatellite markers. plants identified as diploid by flow cytometry continued to be screened for dhs as above. using this amended screening procedure, we have identified over  <dig>  h palms from approximately  <dig> million seedlings .

to have maximum utility this h/dh material should encompass as much genetic diversity from within the breeding germplasm as possible. a principal coordinates analysis performed on h profiles using  <dig> microsatellite loci showed the first two axes accounted for 58% of the detected variation. while most hs had a strong affinity to commercial duras, hs have also been generated from pisifera types and overall variability amongst hs encompassed that seen for the entire commercial palm material .

effort then focussed on the creation of dhs from this rich germplasm of h genotypes . the most direct route to obtain dhs is to use chemical application to induce chromosome doubling. we applied a range of treatments to  <dig> h seedlings and screened leaves of the recovered material for evidence of chromosome doubling. flow cytometry revealed that  <dig> seedlings contained substantial diploid sectors in their leaves; one palm was 100% doubled after exposure to <dig> mm colchicine  and  <dig> ppm ga <dig>  to date,  <dig> h genotypes have produced pollen. this finding demonstrates scope for securing fertile gametes from diploid inflorescences or inflorescence sectors for dh or f <dig> production. indeed, seed set using pollen from dh material has now been achieved . whilst further optimization work is required, our results when combined with experience in other crops  <cit>  suggest routine production of fertile dh oil palm lines will be a relatively simple task.

CONCLUSIONS
the simple high-throughput phenotypic-genotypic seedling selection system used here provides a fourth practical approach to supplement androgenesis, wide crossing and gynogenesis  <cit>  and has potential for many crops where h/dh production remains elusive. the prospect of adopting a similar untargeted approach more widely seems both plausible and attractive, and may be possible without experienced operators, especially as sophisticated phenomic screening systems  <cit>  become more accessible.

in the case of oil palm, the efficacy of our h screening combined with the demonstrated ability to create dh palms, opens the way for the development of 100% true-breeding parental clones for f <dig> variety breeding. thereafter, it is hoped that the potential genetic gain available from oil palm f <dig> hybrids will match that in other crops. if such a gain is achieved it could be beneficial in several ways. first, high-yielding f <dig> palms are likely to accelerate replacement of palms in existing plantations and cause a step-increase in production. secondly, this breeding strategy provides greater flexibility for breeders to respond rapidly to emergent threats . thirdly, using palm oil and its associated wastes for energy generation  <cit>  could substantially reduce carbon-based emissions currently associated with the palm oil lifecycle  <cit> . fourthly, dh oil palms could be exploited in combination with transgenic techniques that are now available for this crop  <cit> . looking forward, the clear challenge is to maintain and improve oil palm productivity in the face of a changing climate sufficient to keep pace with growing demand  <cit> . however, it is important to point out that breeding is simply one stage in a long process from plantation to the eventual processed product and the economic realities of this international industry will finally determine the impact of any novel technology on the global agricultural system for this crop.

the provision here of a system for haploid-based f <dig> hybrid breeding in oil palm represents the first technological breakthrough likely to lead to step improvements in yield for this crop, and can also be applied to other crops recalcitrant to in vitro based h/dh systems. this methodology, in particular the application of high-throughput flow cytometry, has recently been applied successfully to two other tropical crops, namely rubber  and cocoa  .
