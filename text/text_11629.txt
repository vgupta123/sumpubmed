BACKGROUND
elucidating the process of adaptation and understanding its genetic basis is a major mission of modern evolutionary biology
 <cit> . although there are a few genome-level studies of model organisms
 <cit> , most previous studies have focused on a single or a few candidate genes, which limited our understanding of the molecular basis of adaptation in many non-model systems. recent advances in dna sequencing technology and bioinformatic tools enable us to access and analyse massive sequence data in a short time at an affordable cost, which allows large-scale comparisons at genome, exome, or transcriptome levels
 <cit> . these advances present new opportunities for examining the genetic basis of many adaptive processes.

understanding how organisms adapt to high-elevation environments can provide important insights into the process of adaptive evolution, particularly interactions and trade-offs between genes and pathways involved in simultaneous adaptive responses to multiple environmental challenges
 <cit> . high-elevation environments impose severe physiological challenges to organisms, particularly those related to declined levels of oxygen, low temperature, and elevated levels of ultraviolet  radiation
 <cit> . physiological variation and adaptation to high-elevation habitats are well documented in many vertebrates
 <cit> ; however, study of their genetic basis is still in its infancy. much of the previous work has focused on a few candidate loci, such as hemoglobin related genes and mitochondrial genes
 <cit> . only recently, analyses of genome-wide variations among species and populations living in different altitudinal environments have begun to shed light into the genetic basis of many adaptive processes. for example, genes related to hypoxia response and energy metabolism were shown to be responsible for physiological adaptations in several high-elevation species
 <cit> . all these genome-wide studies investigated endothermic species. ectothermic species have large physiological differences and may have evolved different mechanisms for adaption to high-elevation environments
 <cit> . for example, instead of maintaining high levels of metabolism for temperature stability, poikilothermic species may lower their metabolic rate to cope with low external temperatures
 <cit> . understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to high elevations in poikilothermic species will not only complement our knowledge about endothermic species, but may also reveal novel mechanisms that are applicable to species that represent a much larger portion of the tree of life.

a pair of anuran species, rana chensinensis and r. kukunoris, provide an excellent model system to study how poikilothermic species adapt to high-altitude habitats. rana chensinensis is a widespread species and primarily occurs at low elevations of 600– <dig> m above sea level . rana kukunoris is a high-elevation species that is only found at 2800– <dig> m a.s.l.
 <cit> . previous studies suggest that the two species descended from a r. chensinensis-like common ancestor that inhabited low elevations, and speciation of r. kukunoris coincided with the recent uplift of the tibetan plateau approximately  <dig>  million years ago
 <cit> . both species are diploid with  <dig> pairs of chromosomes
 <cit>  and r. chensiensis has a diploid genome size of  <dig>  picograms 
 <cit> .

the objective of this study is to make a genome wide search for genes that may be involved in adaptation to high-elevation environments in these amphibians, and identify their associated functions. we sampled multiple tissues of r. chensinensis and r. kukunoris and sequenced their transcriptomes using an illumina sequencing platform. by comparing their transcriptomes, we describe genes showing strong signals of positive selection. the functional and phenotypic outcomes of these candidate genes are further inferred by annotating to genomic resources of a variety of model vertebrate species. we report a list of candidate genes that are highly likely to be involved in high-elevation adaptation processes.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing, de novo assembly, and gene annotation
a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads of r. chensinensis, and  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads of r. kukunoris, were generated by illumina sequencing. we first filtered these reads, and removed  <dig>  and  <dig>  defective reads for each species, respectively.

de novo assembly of cleaned reads was performed using various combinations of k-mer lengths and coverage cut-off values
 <cit> . in total,  <dig> raw assemblies were obtained for each species and were further merged by integrating sequence overlaps and eliminating redundancies for each species. the total length of the final set of assemblies was  <dig>  mega base pairs  for r. chensinensis and  <dig>  mb for r. kukunoris. for r. chensinensis,  <dig>  transcripts were obtained with an n <dig> of  <dig>  base pairs  and a mean length of  <dig> bp, and for r. kukunoris,  <dig>  transcripts were obtained with an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp and a mean length of  <dig> bp. all information of data production is summarized in table
 <dig>  and the length distribution of all transcripts is shown in figure
 <dig>  

bp=base pair; mb=mega base pairs.

we constructed a reference dataset using combined protein data from seven species that represented all major lineages of vertebrates for gene annotation. transcripts that did not match the reference dataset were blasted against a non-redundant  protein database of the genbank. in total,  <dig>  transcripts of r. chensinensis were annotated to  <dig>  unique genes, accounting for  <dig>  % of the total transcripts. some transcripts were likely products of alternative splicing. the e-value distribution showed that  <dig> % of the annotated transcripts had an e-value below 1e- <dig>  and the similarity distribution showed that  <dig> % of the annotated transcripts had a similarity greater than 60%. similarly,  <dig>  transcripts of r. kukunoris were annotated to  <dig>  unique genes, accounting for  <dig> % of the total transcripts. furthermore,  <dig> % of the annotated transcripts had an e-value below 1e- <dig>  and  <dig> % of the annotated transcripts had a similarity greater than 60% .

in agreement with previous studies, we found that the quality of sequence reads and appropriate assembly methods are essential in obtaining a reliable de novo assembly, which is the foundation of all other analyses
 <cit> . in particular, de novo assembly by exploring a wide range of k-mer and cut-off values is a powerful approach. due to the differential gene expression, sequence coverage among transcripts tends to be uneven, which poses various challenges for de novo assembly
 <cit> . the use of high k-mer lengths can generate more contiguous assemblies of highly expressed transcripts. on the other hand, the use of low k-mer lengths likely helps to obtain better assemblies for under expressed genes
 <cit> . adjusting coverage cut-off value can also help to increase the assembly quality when there are similar regions among homologous transcripts
 <cit> . we used five different k-mer lengths and six different coverage cut-off values. in both species, the final assembly had larger n <dig> and mean lengths than any of the raw assemblies generated by using a single value of both parameters . the final assembly also had a higher proportion of annotated transcripts  than all raw assemblies. moreover, a final step that maps all reads back to the assembled transcripts can also help to improve the quality of assembly. this process allows for a revision of any potential assembly errors and ascertains the consensus sequences representing the majority base calls at heterozygous sites.

gene ontology  classification
gene ontology category was widely used to classify gene functions
 <cit> . we first removed  <dig>  transcripts for r. chensinensis and  <dig>  transcripts for r. kukunoris that were likely generated from alternative splicing. among the remaining  <dig>  transcripts of r. chensinensis, which likely represented the same number of unique genes, a total of  <dig>  transcripts had the go annotation under three main divisions. likewise, among the  <dig>  annotated transcripts of r. kukunoris,  <dig>  transcripts had the go annotation. the go category distributions of the transcripts for both species were highly similar . within the function of “cellular component”,  <dig> level- <dig> categories were identified, and the terms “cell”, “cell part”, and “organelle” were the dominant components . within the function of “molecular functions”,  <dig> level- <dig> categories were identified, and the term “binding” was dominant . within the third function of “biological process”,  <dig> level- <dig> categories were identified, and the terms “cellular process”, “metabolic process”, “biological regulation”, and “pigmentation” were the main functional categories .

identification of putative orthologs
reciprocal best hit method was used to identify putative orthologs between the two species
 <cit> . a total of  <dig>  pairs of putative orthologs were identified by comparing all annotated transcripts. we then compared each pair of putative orthologs to the reference to determine their open reading frames  and eliminated the sequences with unexpected stop-codons and ambiguous alignments. after filtering the redundant orthologs that may result from alternative splicing,  <dig>  pairs of unique orthologs were finally identified and used in the downstream analyses.

we also identified  <dig>  pairs of possible orthologs from transcripts that could not be annotated. we were able to use eboss-getorf
 <cit>  to predict the orfs of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts in r. chensinensis and r. kukunoris, respectively. among these transcripts,  <dig>  pairs were properly aligned, which were also used in the test for positive selection.

test for positive selection
the ka/ks ratio was used to test for positive selection
 <cit> . among the  <dig>  pairs of annotated orthologs,  <dig> pairs were identical,  <dig>  pairs had only synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions, and  <dig>  pairs had both types of substitutions, for which the ka/ks ratio were calculated. the mean values of ka, ks, and ka/ks ratio of all orthologous pairs were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.

a total of  <dig>  pairs of orthologs had a ka/ks ratio greater than  <dig>  indicating these genes may have experienced strong positive selection . in addition, a ka/ks ratio of  <dig>  was also suggested as a useful cut-off value to identify genes under positive selection
 <cit> , and in our study,  <dig>  pairs of orthologs had a ka/ks ratio between  <dig>  and  <dig> . therefore, all these  <dig> orthologs  were considered as candidate genes that have likely experienced positive selection. 

among the  <dig>  pairs of predicted coding sequences from un-annotated transcripts,  <dig>  pairs had a ka/ks ratio greater than  <dig> and  <dig>  pairs had a ka/ks ratio between  <dig>  and  <dig>  they were supplementary to the annotated candidate gene list for future studies.

we clustered all the unique orthologous transcripts to go categories. among the  <dig>  annotated unique orthologs,  <dig>  were assigned to  <dig>  go terms, among which  <dig>  terms had at least  <dig> orthologs. the mean ka/ks ratio for each of the  <dig>  terms was calculated , and  <dig>  terms had a mean ka/ks ratio higher than the mean ratio of all orthologs . the terms with the highest ka/ks ratio included “adult heart development”, “sarcomere organization” and “condensed nuclear chromosome”. likewise, the terms with the smallest ka/ks ratio included “protein k63-linked ubiquitination”, “protein k48-linked ubiquitination” and “ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process”. the terms with low ka/ks ratio probably represent the most conservative functions, and the terms with high ka/ks ratio likely represent the rapidly evolving functions between the two species
 <cit> .

functional analysis for candidate genes
among the  <dig> candidate genes ,  <dig> were annotated to go categories . using the program wego
 <cit> , we compared the go category distribution  of the candidate genes with that of the non-candidate genes  . seven go terms had a higher percentage among the candidate genes than among the non-candidate genes. several of these terms were associated with immunity and host defense, such as “immune response” , “leukocyte activation” , and “lymphocyte costimulation” . immune related genes were commonly found under positive selection during speciation processes and in species that do not live at high elevations
 <cit> . therefore, although under positive selection, these genes may not be related to adaptation to a high-elevation environment. 

to identify genes that may closely associate to the adaptation to high elevations, we performed a two-step approach to screen all the candidate genes according to their functions. first, we compared our candidate genes to a list proposed by simonson et al.
 <cit> , which encompasses the functions and their associated go categories for adaptation to high-elevation hypoxia. two genes associated with “response to hypoxia” and two genes associated with “oxygen binding” were identified from our candidate gene list . second, based on our current understanding on phenotypic adaptation to high elevations of poikilothermic species, we selected three other candidate functions, which are associated with response to ultraviolet rays
 <cit> , reactive oxygen species metabolism, and metabolic regulation
 <cit> . ten additional genes were identified with these candidate functions, which were in the go categories “response to uv”, “glutathione metabolic process”, and “atp catabolic process” . 

these fourteen genes have ka/ks ratio greater than  <dig>  and are most likely involved in the adaptation to high-elevation environments.

the two candidate genes associated with “oxygen binding”, cyp2f <dig> and cyp4b <dig>  belong to the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily . the function of cyp is to catalyze the oxidation of organic substances
 <cit> . the mean ka/ks ratio of the term “oxygen binding” is  <dig> , much higher than the mean ka/ks ratio of all orthologs , suggesting a strong overall positive selection on genes in this category. previous studies of tibetan people also found that several other cyp genes showed signatures of positive selection related to “oxygen binding”
 <cit> . our finding suggests a functional  convergent evolution between humans and rana kukunoris, although the genes behind the functional adaptation are different .

the gene ubiquitin-specific protease  <dig>  is also under strong positive selection , and we found a non-synonymous substitution in its his domain of n-terminal, which is likely crucial for its function
 <cit> . usp- <dig> is a conserved gene that encode an enzyme playing an important role in dna repair against uv damage
 <cit> . thus, usp- <dig> may be especially important for amphibians to adapt to the high uv radiation environment, since their skin is completely exposed without any protection from fur or scales.

four genes, gpx <dig>  gsto <dig>  prdx <dig>  scp <dig>  which are associated with response to reactive oxygen species , have also experienced positive selection . the first two genes encode crucial enzymes in glutathione metabolic pathway, which prevent damage to important cellular components by ros-like peroxides and free radicals
 <cit> . the functions of the latter two genes are related to the functions of peroxisome that are also associated with response to oxidative stress
 <cit> . bickler and buck
 <cit>  proposed that the ability of poikilothermic animals to survive under low temperature and oxygen conditions depends on the ability of avoiding free-radical injury. the four genes identified here are potentially related to the adaptive process in this aspect.

we also identified five metabolism related genes that may be associated with adaptation to high elevations. the mto- <dig> and v-atpase g <dig> genes are related to atp synthesis and energy metabolism in the mitochondrion
 <cit> ; both functions are important in the process of high-elevation adaptation
 <cit> . the acy <dig>  noxo <dig> and rsl1d1genes are related to primary, nadph and protein metabolism, respectively
 <cit> . functional changes associated with metabolic processes are likely essential for the adaptation to high-elevation environments.

a surprising absence from our candidate gene list is the hemoglobin related genes. responses to hypoxia in endothermic animal species involve mostly hemoglobin genes and hif- <dig> pathways, and we did not observe any of those genes bearing signature of positive selection. the mean ka/ks ratio  of the entire term “response to hypoxia” was lower than average level , although two genes  had ka/ks ratio greater than  <dig>  but less than  <dig> . some other genes involved in adaptation to high elevations in endothermic species also had a low ka/ks ratio in our comparison, for example, epas1
 <cit>  , arg2
 <cit>  , and ep300
 <cit>  . the gene egln1
 <cit>  is an exception in this sense; it has a relatively high ka/ks ratio of  <dig> , which may deserve further examination. this observation is consistent with our prediction that poikilothermic species may develop different adaptive mechanisms from endotherms.

future directions
our study demonstrated that comparing sequences of orthologous genes between species by de novo transcriptome sequencing offers a fast and cost-effective approach to detect positive selection and to understand adaptive evolution at the genomic level. further tests are needed to validate these candidate genes that we have identified. population-level analysis can be applied to these candidate genes to examine if signals of positive selection on these genes are also evident at the population level. detailed functional research is also needed to illustrate how the positively selected genes promote the fitness of poikilothermic species under the high-elevation environment. finally, to understand the general genetic mechanisms of adaptation to high elevations of poikilothermic animals, it is necessary to examine other poikilothermic species from various groups. for example, hemoglobin genes, which were thought to play an important role in adaptation to high elevations in endothermic species, were absent from our candidate gene list and the importance of their role remained largely unknown in other poikilothermic species
 <cit> . studies on a wide range of species are necessary to understand parallel and convergent adaptive evolution to high elevations between poikilotherms and endotherms.

better and more elaborative tests for positive selection should be explored in order to improve their sensitivity. ka/ks ratio can only serve as a preliminary approximate estimator. functional analysis with pre-defined “potential functions for adaptation”, or candidate genes, largely limits the scope of discovery. only with tests that are solely based on genetic data at a genome-wide scope, it is possible to establish a new ‘genotype to phenotype’ approach to the study of adaptation, which will complement the traditional ‘phenotype to genotype’ approach. with this new approach, we can take the great advantage of rapidly accumulating genomic data to reveal novel phenotypes of adaptation.

CONCLUSIONS
by comparing the transcriptomes of two ranid species, one from high and one from low altitudes, we identified  <dig> protein-coding genes that have experienced strong positive selection , and  <dig> genes that may also bear signatures of positive selection . among them,  <dig> genes are most likely involved in the adaptive process to high-elevation environments, particularly genes associated with oxygen binding , response to uv , and repair of free radical injuries . furthermore, we found evidence for convergent evolution between poikilothermic and endothermic species; genes from the cyp superfamily are under positive selection in both humans and amphibians. yet, we also observed differences between them; hemoglobin related genes are commonly involved in high-elevation adaptation in endotherms, but are absent from our candidate gene list. the genes that display signatures of positive selection will serve as a baseline for further investigations that aim to understand high-elevation adaptation at both molecular and phenotypic levels.
