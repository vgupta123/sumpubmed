BACKGROUND
solvents such as acetone, butanol and ethanol  produced through microbial fermentation represent important potential renewable fuels and chemicals  <cit> . clostridium acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii are among the prominent solvent-producing species. c. beijerinckii exhibits a broader substrate range and optimum ph for growth and solvent production  <cit> ; thus it may have greater potential for biosolvent production than c. acetobutylicum.

the genome of c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> was sequenced by the doe joint genome institute in  <dig>  the genome size is  <dig>  mb, which is 50% larger than that of c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  the c. beijerinckii  <dig> solvent-producing genes are all located on the chromosome, as opposed to the location of these genes on a mega-plasmid in c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  transcriptional analysis is essential to understand gene functions and regulation and thus elucidate proper strategies for further strain improvement. while global gene expression patterns for c. acetobutylicum have been studied extensively  <cit> , limited information is available on the genome-wide transcriptional analysis for c. beijerinckii  <cit> . rna-seq is based on the high-throughput dna sequencing technology and provides an approach to profile and quantify gene expression to an unprecedented resolution and depth  <cit> . rna-seq technology has several advantages over dna microarray methods for transcriptional analysis. first, microarray and other hybridization techniques exhibit a relatively low dynamic range for the detection of transcriptional levels due to background, saturation and poor sensitivity for gene expression at very low or high levels  <cit> , while rna-seq does not have an upper limit for quantification and has a larger dynamic range of expression levels. in addition, when compared to microarray-based approaches, rna-seq has very low background noise because dna sequence reads can be unambiguously mapped to unique regions along the genome  <cit> . several recent studies have proven that rna-seq is a powerful tool for transcriptional analysis  <cit> . in this study, a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of c. beijerinckii  <dig> over the course of a batch fermentation was described from an unbiased perspective using rna-seq technology. the findings from this work provided insights for further c. beijerinckii strain improvement employing system biology-based strategies and metabolic engineering. furthermore, this work is also an essential methodology reference for conducting transcriptional analysis employing next-generation sequencing technology.

RESULTS
growth kinetics and abe fermentation
the c. beijerinckii  <dig> growth response in the batch fermentation is illustrated in figure 1a . the fermentation shifted from acidogenesis to solventogenesis at approximately  <dig> - <dig> h. production of solvents was detected at between  <dig> - <dig>  h after the start of fermentation, which corresponded to the late exponential growth phase. butanol continued to increase throughout the stationary phase . samples for rna isolation were collected at various time points during acidogenesis  and solventogenesis  . these samples were sequenced for dynamic transcriptional profiling for c. beijerinckii  <dig> 

overall gene transcription dynamics
the 75-nt sequence reads were mapped to the c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome. only those reads that mapped unambiguously to the genome were used for further analyses . based on rna-seq sequence data,  <dig> out of  <dig>  protein-coding genes had detectable expression in all six sampling time points, while  <dig> demonstrated no transcripts over all six time points, and are likely silent  <cit> .

*sample f was sequenced with  <dig> sample/lane, while samples a-e with  <dig> samples/lane. see methods section for more details; ** pseudogenes included

on the other hand, there were some genes that demonstrated little variation in expression levels throughout the entire fermentation process, and they are regarded as putative housekeeping genes . in this study,  <dig> protein-coding genes were identified as putative hkgs with the lowest coefficient of variation  in rpkm  values among all the sampling points  <cit> . for accurate gene expression analysis, normalization of gene expression against hkgs is generally required. in the qrt-pcr test in this work, a putative hkg  with highly constant expression levels across all six sampling points was selected as the endogenous control gene.

detrended correspondence analysis  was conducted on the rna-seq data to generate overall dynamic transcription profiles throughout the batch fermentation process. dca is an ordination technique that uses detrending to remove the 'arch effect' usually existing in correspondence analysis  <cit> . as shown in figure 2a, an obvious temporal variation trend was observed for the overall gene transcription. while the first three samples which were from the exponential and transition phases presented both significant first detrended correspondence  and second detrended correspondence , the last three samples which were from stationary phase demonstrated only significant dc <dig> but little dc <dig>  the temporal variation trend of the overall gene expression is consistent with different cell physiological states during transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis.

a z-score analysis was conducted to investigate the overall gene expression pattern at each time point. z-score measures the number of standard deviations that a gene expression in a specific sample is from the mean expression of this gene over all samples. it is a dimensionless quantity derived by subtracting the mean expression of a specific gene over all samples from the individual expression level in a specific sample and then dividing the difference by the standard deviation  <cit> . the results demonstrated temporally dynamic patterns over the course of cell growth and batch fermentation . generally, during exponential and early stationary phases , more genes shifted towards higher expression values , while during late stationary phases, more genes shifted to lower expression levels . a list of genes whose z-score was >  <dig>  in each sample is summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the highly expressed gene categories were different at different time points during the course of the fermentation. for example, translation related genes  were predominant  in sample a , indicating fast protein synthesis during this growth stage; while signal transduction mechanism involved genes  were overrepresented at  <dig> h, indicating the cellular reaction to the environmental changes.

the expression of different genes in a specific sample can be compared by plotting log2-transformed rpkm values of all genes against their loci along the genome .

sample b represented the beginning of the transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. in this sample, among the highest expressed genes, besides the genes encoding hypothetical proteins ,  <dig> are ribosomal protein genes, indicating active protein synthesis machinery in the cell at this time point. in addition, genes involved in acid and solvent formation were detected as highly expressed, including adc , thl , hbd , ald , adh , ctfb , ctfa  and buk . highly expressed genes also included those encoding proteins that mediate electron transfer, such as cbei_ <dig> , cbei_ <dig>  cbei_ <dig> , cbei_ <dig>  cbei_ <dig> , and those genes related to cell motility , phosphotransferase system  for sugar uptake  and glycolytic activity  . the time frame of sample d was consistent with the transition to non-active growth and clostridial spore formation. while the solventogenesis genes  and several ferredoxin activity protein encoding genes  were still actively expressed at this stage , genes encoding sporulation-related proteins demonstrated the highest transcriptional activities. these genes included those encoding spore coat proteins , small acid-soluble spore proteins , abrb family transcriptional regulator  and sporulation sigma factor sigk .

it is interesting that the hypothetical genes account for a large fraction of the highly expressed genes . as we mentioned previously  <cit> , the genome annotation for c. beijerinckii  <dig> is far from completed. many of the hypothetical genes predicted by computational analysis algorithms may have important functions for the cell activities. the rna-seq results herein provided useful references for future studies in defining the specific functions of these genes.

expression of primary metabolic genes
glycolysis genes
generally, the glycolysis genes encoding the pathway for conversion of glucose to pyruvate were expressed at high levels throughout the entire fermentation process . comparatively, the expression of most of these genes decreased slightly after entering the stationary phase, down-regulated by 2- to 4-fold. in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  three genes  are annotated as encoding 6-phosphofructokinase . while cbei_ <dig> and _ <dig> were down-regulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold respectively after entering stationary phase, cbei_ <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold at time point c and expressed at higher levels throughout stationary phase. cbei_ <dig>  cbei_ <dig> and cbei_ <dig> are all annotated as encoding pyruvate kinase . while cbei_ <dig> and _ <dig> decreased by  <dig> -fold after entering stationary phase, cbei_ <dig> was expressed at a higher level throughout stationary phase when compared to the exponential phase. these observations imply that different allelic genes may be induced at different specific stages and play different roles during the fermentation process. the expression patterns of glycolysis genes in this study are similar to those found for c. beijerinckii  <dig> in shi and blaschek   <cit> . while in a time course transcriptional analysis of c. acetobutylicum  <dig> during a batch fermentation, most of the glycolysis genes showed higher expression during stationary-phase  <cit> .

acidogenesis and solventogenesis genes
the acetate formation genes encoding phosphotransacetylase  and acetate kinase  and the butyrate formation genes encoding phosphate butyryltransferase  and butyrate kinase  were up-regulated during the acidogenesis phase and peaked at time point b, and declined 2- to 4-fold at the onset of solvent formation . based on the sequencing data, the pta-ack and ptb-buk gene operon structures were identified  <cit> . the coordinated expression patterns of these two gene clusters further confirmed this transcriptional organization. expression of genes encoding proteins involved in butyryl coenzyme a  formation was induced early during the acidogenesis phase, and remained at high levels after cells entered stationary phase , and afterwards decreased 3-to 7-fold at late stationary phase, although the absolute transcription level was still high .

the product of the thla  in c. beijerinckii has 77% amino acid sequence identity to the product of thla  in c. acetobutylicum, and the product of a second thiolase gene  shows 90% amino acid sequence identity to that of thlb  in c. acetobutylicum . a transcriptional analysis with qrt-pcr for continuous cultures of c. acetobutylicum indicated that the level of thlb transcripts was much lower compared to the level of thla transcript, and the expression of thlb was maximal at about  <dig> to  <dig> h after induction of solvent formation  <cit> . whereas another transcriptional analysis for continuous cultures of c. acetobutylicum showed that thlb was highly induced only during the transition state from acidogenesis to solventogenesis  <cit> . in this study, the expression level of thlb, although much lower than that of thla, was found to be maximal in late stationary phase , which is around  <dig> to  <dig> h after onset of solventogenesis . while thla is involved in the primary metabolism of acid and solvent formation, the physiological function of thlb warrants further study. in the c. beijerinckii  <dig> genome, there are different genes encoding for isoenzymes active in specific stages and playing different roles. transcriptomic analysis leads to insights for further biochemical characterization of the isoenzymes properties and functions.

in c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  the genes adhe , ctfa  and ctfb  are located in the sol  operon on the mega-plasmid psol <dig>  while adc  is organized in a monocistronic operon in the opposite direction  <cit> . the regulation of adc was believed to differ from that of the sol operon, and the expression of adc was reported to be initiated earlier than the sol operon in both batch and continuous cultures of c. acetobutylicum  <cit> . based on our sequencing data, a sol operon organized in the order of ald -ctfa -ctfb -adc  was revealed in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  <cit> . consistent with this transcriptomic organization, coordinated expression was observed for the sol operon genes. their expression was up-regulated at the onset of solventogenesis phase and maintained at high levels during the stationary phase .

two iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase genes adha  and adhb  were previously characterized in the solvent-producing strain c. beijerinckii nrrl b <dig>  <cit> . the enzymes encoded by both genes were classified as primary alcohol dehydrogenases, which catalyze the reaction for primary alcohol  production  <cit> . the product of cbei_ <dig> in c. beijerinckii  <dig> exists 99% and 97% amino acid sequence identity to that of adha and adhb, and the product of cbei_ <dig> has 97% and 94% amino acid sequence identity to that of adhb and adha, respectively. cbei_ <dig> and _ <dig> may play key roles during primary alcohol production in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  both genes were induced to high levels  when the fermentation transitioned from the acid production phase to the solvent production phase , and then decreased. similar transient up-regulation of adh genes and enzymes associated with active solvent production was previously reported for c. beijerinckii nrrl b <dig> and c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  <cit> .

there are  <dig> annotated alcohol dehydrogenase genes in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  suggesting the great potential for solvent production of this microorganism. most of these genes were induced early during the acidogenesis phase and expressed at high levels throughout the solvent production process, although some of them did not have detectable expression at some specific time points . the specific functions of different alcohol dehydrogenase genes associated with c. beijerinckii require further investigation.

sporulation genes
production of solvents was first detected between  <dig> - <dig>  h after the start of fermentation, which corresponded to the late exponential growth phase. the initiation of sporulation in c. beijerinckii  <dig> was concurrent with the onset of solventogenesis.

in b. subtilis, the gene spo0h encodes the earliest acting sigma factor associated with sporulation, σh, which regulates the early sporulation genes, including spo0a and sigf operon  <cit> . the phosphorylated spo0a  by phosphorelay system indirectly induces spo0h transcription by repressing abrb transcription  <cit> . in clostridia, no similar phosphorelay components and regulation system have been observed. it have been reported that in c. acetobutylicum, spo0h and spo0a were both constitutively expressed at constant levels throughout the growth cycle, and the amount of spo0h transcript was much lower than that of spo0a  <cit> . while a recent time-course transcriptional analysis of c. acetobutylicum indicated that spo0a was induced at the onset of sporulation and kept at high levels throughout the stationary phase  <cit> . in this study, the expression of spo0h  was constant from time points a-c, but was down-regulated  <dig> -fold later during the fermentation . the expression of spo0a  was induced early during the acidogenesis phase, and elevated by  <dig> -fold during the transition phase and the onset of solventogenesis , after which the expression was slightly down-regulated . comparatively, the transcription level of spo0a was much higher than that of spo0h . putative σh-dependent promoter and spo0a-binding motif  have been identified upstream of the spo0a gene in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  <cit> .

it is well established that spo0a is the master regulator for sporulation events in both bacilli and clostridia  <cit> . phosphorylated spo0a has been reported to induce various targets, including the solventogenic operon and multiple sporulation sigma factor genes in c. acetobutylicum  <cit> . 0a boxes were also identified upstream of the operons related to chemotaxis/motility, suggesting the possible negative regulation of spo0a on the expression of chemotaxis/motility genes  <cit> . a previous study involving insertional inactivation of spo0a indicated that spo0a does also control the formation of solvents, spores and granulose in c. beijerinckii  <cit> . a recently developed spo0a mutant of c. beijerinckii  <dig> exhibited an asporogenous and non-septating phenotype  <cit> 

the sigf operon  encodes the anti-anti-sigma factor , the anti-sigma factor  and the sigma factor σf. in the "crisscross regulation" system of b. subtilis, both σh and spo0a ~ p are required for the expression of the genes in this operon  <cit> . in this study, the sigf operon genes were induced before the onset of sporulation , and kept coordinated and high-regulated throughout the fermentation .

spoiie is a phosphatase required for regulating the dephosphorylation of spoiiaa, which helps to release the σf from spoiiab by forming an adp-spoiiab-spoiiaa complex  <cit> . in b. subtilis, expression of spoiie starts about  <dig> h after the onset of sporulation, and peaks approximately  <dig> h later  <cit> . in the present study, high expression of spoiie  in c. beijerinckii  <dig> was induced at time point c  following the onset of solvent production, and then quickly decreased to a lower level  .

σe is the first mother cell-specific sigma factor in b. subtilis, and the expression of sige begins about  <dig> h after the onset of sporulation  <cit> . in c. acetobutylicum, the expression of sige operon  does not exceed  <dig> -fold higher than that at the initiation of fermentation  <cit> . in the case of c. beijerinckii, the expression of sige operon  was up-regulated around 20-fold at time point c, and then decreased by 3- to 6-fold during late stationary phase .

σg is a forespore-specific sigma factor and it is active after complete engulfment of the forespore by the mother cell  <cit> . in b. subtilis, significant expression of sigg begins  <dig> to  <dig> min after the onset of sporulation  <cit> . in the experiment presented here, the expression of sigg was up-regulated by  <dig> -fold at time point c, and kept at high levels throughout the stationary process. more than  <dig> genes in b. subtilis which are related to spore protection and maturation were identified to be regulated by σg  <cit> . among them, spoivb is the gene encoding a signal protein for activating the later-acting sigma factor σk in the mother cell  <cit> ; spova operon  is a cluster of sporulation genes downstream of the sigf operon associated with dipicolinic acid transport into the developing spores  <cit> . in many clostridium species, spovac, ad, ae were found at the same locus, but spovaa and ab are absent  <cit> . this is also the case for c. beijerinckii  <dig>  and spovac, ad, ae  were found to be organized in a single operon based on rna-seq data  <cit> . the expression of spoivb and the spova operon was induced after the onset of high expression of sigg, and peaked at time points d and e . the expression profiles of sigg and the putative σg-regulated genes well confirmed their regulation manner in c. beijerinckii .

sporulation regulation factors genes sige and sigg in c. beijerinckii in the present study were induced and up-regulated > 20-fold right after the onset of sporulation. while in c. acetobutylicum, no active expression of sige and sigg was detected up to  <dig>  h after the onset of sporulation  <cit> . this dissimilarity coincides with the fact that forespores and endspores develop more rapidly in c. beijerinckii  <dig> than in c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  <cit> .

in b. subtilis, sigk gene is expressed from a σe-dependent promoter, and regulated by another transcription factor spoiiid  <cit> . the sigk gene is first expressed as an inactive pro-σk factor, and then cleaved to activate by a membrane-localized protease, spoivfb, whose activity is induced by spoivb, the signaling protein produced in the forespore  <cit> . the sigk gene in most clostridial species was also found to encode a pro-σk factor, and spoivfb and spoivb were identified in most clostridial species  <cit> . the product of cbei_ <dig>  in c. beijerinckii exhibits 36% amino acid identity  and 62% positive  to spoivfb in c. acetobutylicum by blastp. the expression of spoiiid  and sigk  was induced unexpectedly early at time point b, and increased up to  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold respectively at time point d . afterwards, both genes maintained at high expression levels. nevertheless, significant expression of cbei_ <dig>  was only observed at time point c, and then the expression decreased to a lower level .

in b. subtilis, abrb encodes a transition state regulator, whose transcription depression by spo0a leads to a burst of σh synthesis at the initiation of sporulation  <cit> . maximal expression of abrb in b. subtilis was observed  <dig> h before the onset of sporulation  <cit> . in c. acetobutylicum, three abrb homologs  were identified  <cit> , among which cac <dig> was suggested as the putative true transitional-state regulator  <cit> . however, the decrease of expression of cac <dig> was not observed at initiation of sporulation but the highest expression was observed after the onset of sporulation during a time course transcriptional analysis for the wild type c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  <cit> . in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  six loci were annotated as genes encoding abrb family transcriptional regulator. among them, expression of three  are not detectable most of the time. expression of cbei_ <dig> decreased temporally by  <dig> -fold at time point b, but up-regulated back to even higher levels afterwards. the expression of cbei_ <dig> was significantly depressed at time point c , and kept at low levels during the stationary phase. although cbei_ <dig> was down-regulated by  <dig> -fold at time point c, following expression was kept at relatively high levels and increased to a peak level at time point f . in summary, none of the abrb genes in c. beijerinckii  <dig> displayed exact antagonistic expression pattern to that of spo0h. whether there are abrb genes that play the similar role as abrb in b. subtilis warrants further study in respect that spo0h in this study had a very different transcriptional profile from that in b. subtilis.

as observed in other clostridium species, there was no orthologous phosphorelay system or sensory kinases in c. beijerinckii similar to those found in b. subtilis  for phosphorylating spo0a  <cit> . in c. acetobutylicum, it was suggested that the gene cac <dig> might act in a similar fashion to that of the sensory kinase genes in b. subtilis  <cit> . a recent study revealed evidence for two possible pathways for spo0a activation in c. acetobutylicum, one dependent on cac <dig>  and the other dependent on cac <dig> and cac <dig>  <cit> . in this study, with the time course transcriptional data, putative candidate proteins can be identified in c. beijerinckii that may play roles similar to sensory kinases for sporulation. out of all the genes annotated as encoding sensory histidine kinases, ten were observed to be momentarily upregulated during the onset of sporulation . further molecular biology work focusing on specific genes needs to be carried out to define the genes that play the key roles in fermentation regulation.

cell motility genes
the cell motility-related genes encode products responsible for chemotactic responses and flagellar assembly  <cit> . from the sequencing data, it was confirmed that a similar flagellar/chemotaxis multi-gene cluster exists in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  as that in c. acetobutylicum   <cit> . motility-related genes in clostridia and bacilli are usually down-regulated in sporulation cells  <cit> . in this study, most genes in the flagellar/chemotaxis cluster were down-regulated by 2- to 4-fold at the onset of sporulation and were kept at lower expression levels thereafter. however, the last three genes at the end of the cluster  were initially down-regulated by 2- to 3-fold at the onset of sporulation, and then unexpectedly increased during late stationary phase .

there are several other genes in c. beijerinckii  <dig> annotated as motility-related. among them, cbei_ <dig>  and cbei_ <dig>  were active during exponential phase, and were down-regulated by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold respectively after cells entered the stationary phase . another chew gene , on the other hand, exhibited an unexpected antagonistic pattern, which was strongly expressed throughout the entire stationary phase and peaked at time point f . the other chemotaxis genes were not active over the course of the fermentation process. the flagellar motility related genes flgb  and flgc  were strongly expressed during exponential phase , and down-regulated by  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold during the stationary phase. it has been reported that the expression of the flagellar/motility operon is negatively regulated by spo0a in b subtilis  <cit> .

quorum sensing gene
the gene luxs  encodes s-ribosylhomocysteinase, which produces autoinducers to function in the luxs/ai- <dig> quorum sensing mechanism  <cit> . maximal autoinducer activity was observed during mid-exponential phase in c. perfringens with autoluminesence assays  <cit> , and the expression of luxs in c. acetobutylicum was found to be roughly proportional to cell density in a time-course transcriptional analysis of c. acetobutylicum  <dig>  <cit> . sequence alignment of the protein encoded by the putative luxs gene in c. beijerinckii  and that in c. acetobutylicum  with blastp indicated that, out of  <dig> amino acids, there exists 74% identity  and 84% positive  matches. the expression of cbei_ <dig> started at a high level during the acidogenesis phase, and then increased by  <dig> -fold and peaked during the transition to solventogenesis , after which the expression decreased gradually to lower levels .

sugar transport genes
the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system  is the predominant sugar uptake pathway in c. beijerinckii  <cit> . the first two pts domains , referred as ei  and hpr , phosphorylate the sugar in the cytoplasm, which has been transported across the cell membrane from the extracellular side by substrate-specific enzyme ii  domains. phosphorylated sugar is then able to enter the glycolytic pathway  <cit> . in c. beijerinckii, ei and hpr are encoded by cbei_ <dig>  and cbei_ <dig>  respectively. the expression of both genes was high throughout the fermentation process with a 2- to 3-fold decrease after onset of solventogenesis . this agrees well with the previous finding that atp-dependent glucose phosphorylation was predominant and phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose phosphorylation was repressed during solventogenic stage for both c. beijerinckii  <dig> and its mutant c. beijerinckii ba <dig> strains, although the latter exhibited a nearly 2-fold-greater atp-dependent phosphorylation rate during solventogenic stage  <cit> .

previous competition studies indicated that glucose and mannose were assimilated by the same pts in c. beijerinckii  <cit> . the mannose family pts transporters are commonly found in gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes, including c. acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii, and exhibit broad substrate specificity for glucose, mannose, sorbose, fructose, and a variety of other sugars  <cit> . in the gene cluster encoding for the mannose family pts transporters, maniiab encodes a membrane fusion protein of the iia and iib subunits involved in sugar phosphorylation, maniic encodes a substrate-specific permease, and maniid encodes a mannose family-specific auxiliary protein   <cit> . the rna-seq data revealed that these three genes were organized in the same operon  in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  <cit> , and the expression of maniiab , maniic  and maniid  was highly coordinated and unexpectedly up-regulated by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold respectively after onset of solventogenesis .

there are  <dig> pts domains identified in c. acetobutylicum, out of which six belongs to the glucose-glucoside  family  <cit> . homologs were identified in c. beijerinckii for all the gene clusters encoding the glc family pts transporters in c. acetobutylicum. among them, only cbei_ <dig>  cbei_ <dig>  cbei_ <dig>  cbei_ <dig> and cbei_ <dig> were actively expressed during the fermentation process, and cbei_ <dig>  and cbei_ <dig>  were especially strongly expressed throughout the batch fermentation process . by comparing the expression dynamics of gene clusters encoding for the glc family pts transporters and those for the mannose family pts transporters, it could be inferred that the glc family pts transporters  play important roles during exponential and early stationary phases, while the mannose family pts transporters may be more closely related to stationary and sporulation events.

self-organizing maps  analysis of functional groups
som analysis was employed to investigate the global expression patterns, especially for genes belonging to specific cog categories across the genome   <cit> . the expression of genes in clusters c <dig> and c <dig> was up-regulated during early exponential-growth phase and decreased to lower levels afterwards. while these two clusters jointly contain  <dig> genes , they are enriched with  <dig> % of the genes related to translation , and  <dig> % of genes related to cell motility . cell motility genes were also over-represented by  <dig> % in cluster c <dig>  where the expression levels of genes were lower in the stationary phase than that in the exponential phase.

carbohydrate transport and metabolism 
nine of the glycolysis genes discussed above  falls into clusters c <dig> and c <dig>  indicating more active glycolytic activities during the exponential-growth phase. on the other hand, solventogenic clostridia initiate granulose production at the early stationary phase; granulose is a glycogen-like polymer used by bacteria for energy storage under severe environments  <cit> . operon prediction for c. acetobutylicum indicated that glgc , glgd , glga  and cac <dig>  express as a single transcript  <cit> . in addition, glgp encodes a granulose phosphorylase , and csra  encodes a putative carbon storage regulator, which was reported to repress the expression of both glga and glgp in escherichia coli  <cit> . in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  it was observed that glgc  and glgd  were organized in a operon, while the gene encoding  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme , glga , glgp  and the gene encoding the catalytic region of alpha amylase  were organized in another adjacent operon  <cit> . cbei_ <dig> was annotated as the csra gene. the five putative granulose formation genes  in c. beijerinckii  <dig> were grouped into cluster c <dig> based on their expression profiles . expression of most granulose formation genes were up-regulated by 2- to 4-fold at transition phase from acidogenesis to solventogenesis  and maintained at high expression levels over the stationary phase  . notwithstanding, the expression of csra  was only detectable at a, c and f, which was much lower than those of the other granulose formation genes . it is not yet clear whether the csra gene in c. beijerinckii functions similarly to that in e. coli.

translation genes 
there are  <dig> translation-related genes included in the som analysis. the majority were grouped in the clusters where the gene expression is active during exponential phase . there are  <dig> genes in c. beijerinckii genome encoding ribosomal proteins. out of the  <dig> genes encoding ribosomal proteins included in the som analysis,  <dig> were clustered in c <dig>  indicating that the protein synthesis machinery in the cell is mostly active during the early exponential phase . similar results were reported for c. acetobutylicum, where most of the ribosomal protein genes were down-regulated at least 3-fold in stationary phase  <cit> .

signal transduction mechanisms genes 
there are  <dig> genes  annotated as signal transduction related genes in c. beijerinckii. som analysis did not reveal any specific enriched clusters for these genes. however, they are slightly over-represented in cluster c <dig> and c <dig> , where the expression levels are higher during the exponential phase . among them, there are important cell chemotaxis and motility associated sensory transduction genes . the expression of genes in clusters c8-c <dig> was momentarily up-regulated at onset of stationary phase and decreased quickly afterwards . the signal transduction genes in clusters c8-c <dig> may represent important signal transducers for solventogenesis and sporulation events. among them, there are genes encoding response regulator receiver proteins, integral membrane sensor signal transduction histidine kinase and two-component transcriptional regulators   <cit> .

correlations of rna-seq and qrt-pcr
the expression measurement with rna-seq approach was validated using qrt-pcr for selected genes. for all the selected genes, the dynamic gene expression profiles over time measured with rna-seq have very similar patterns as those measured with qrt-pcr . we previously showed that good correlation exists between the overall gene expression quantification with rna-seq and that obtained with microarray or qrt-pcr  <cit> . these results demonstrate that rna-seq is an effective approach for quantification of gene expression.

previously, shi and blaschek reported the transcriptional analysis of c. beijerinckii using a ca. 500-gene set dna microarray where only the expression of genes orthologous to those previously found to be important to the physiology of c. acetobutylicum  <dig> was examined  <cit> . in this study, employing rna-seq technology, for the first time the genome-wide dynamic transcriptional profiling of c. beijerinckii correlated with the physiological activities over the course of fermentation process has been revealed with a much larger dynamic range. in addition, single-nucleotide resolution rna-seq data also revealed the transcriptome structural organization of c. beijerinckii  <dig> in depth  <cit> . the transcriptome structural information together with the genome-wide dynamic transcriptional profiling can provide essential references for further improvement of c. beijerinckii strains by employing system biology-based strategies and metabolic engineering approaches. furthermore, the genome-wide rna-seq analysis also disclosed the different expression dynamics of many allelic genes in the genome of c. beijerinckii  <dig>  which provided important insight for future studies on the properties of potential isoenzymes and their associated functions during specific fermentation stages.

CONCLUSIONS
by employing single-base resolution rna-seq technology, the genome-wide transcriptional dynamics of c. beijerinckii  <dig> throughout the course of a batch fermentation was revealed in great depth. rna-seq technology can not only quantify the differential transcription of specific genes over time, but is also able to compare transcription levels of different genes in the same sample. overall dynamic transcription profiles demonstrated obvious temporal variation trend throughout the fermentation, corresponding to the physiological state change of the cells. glycolysis genes demonstrated higher expression during acidogenesis phase. the expression of acid formation genes declined at the onset of solvent formation, in accordance with the metabolic pathway shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. the sol operon, including adc as a part, was up-regulated at the onset of solventogenesis and maintained at high levels through the stationary phase. most sporulation genes in c. beijerinckii  <dig> demonstrated similar temporal expression patterns to those observed in b. subtilis and c. acetobutylicum, while sporulation sigma factor genes sige and sigg exhibited accelerated and stronger expression in c. beijerinckii  <dig>  consistent with the more rapid forespore and endspore development in this strain. the pts transport system encoding genes were highly expressed during acidogenesis and declined 2- to 3-fold after entering solventogenesis phase, agreeing well with the report that atp-dependent glucose phosphorylation was predominant and phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent pts was repressed during solventogenic stage for c. beijerinckii. finally, som and clustering analysis revealed that genes of specific cog functional classes demonstrated global gene expression patterns corresponding to the cell physiological change and fermentation pathway switch.
