BACKGROUND
plants employ both cell surface and cytoplasmic receptors to respond to a wide array of signals from pathogens  <cit> . the receptor protein kinases  represent one of the two large gene families implicated to underlie the recognition events that lead to pathogen resistance  <cit> . two of the most destructive pathogens in soybean  are the soybean cyst nematode  and sudden death syndrome  agent fusarium virguliforme   <cit> . the complex genetics of the cyst nematode populations, the partial nature of plant resistance and temperature sensitivity makes controlling the nematode a difficult task  <cit> . elicitation of plant defenses in response to the pathogens were shown to involve the activity of rlk proteins  <cit>  introgressed from peking. two loci, rhg <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  a2) and rhg1/rfs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> , contain genes that encode receptor like kinase  proteins within the rpk gene family implicated in resistance. gmrlk08- <dig>  is near rhg <dig> and gmrlk18- <dig>  is within rhg1/rfs <dig> <cit> . the translated proteins are both rlks with extra-cellular leucine rich repeats . many other genes can alter scn responses. however, only gmrlk18- <dig> has been shown to underlie resistance to both pathogens in transgenic plants  <cit> 

numerous studies have implicated the lrr domain of rlks in effector recognition and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the intracellular kinase domains of rlks are often involved in phosphorylation mediated signal transduction. the gmrlk18- <dig> protein shows separated domains of different function that are a characteristic feature of both plant and animal rlks. the extracellular domains are predicted to be involved in dimerization/recognition and the intracellular domain is involved in signal transduction. the gmrlk18- <dig> protein was predicted to be an  <dig> amino acid polypeptide that encoded an n-terminal signal peptide ,  <dig> extracellular leucine rich repeats , a single pass trans-membrane domain , and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain .

at rhg1/rfs <dig>  the resistance phenotypes were perfectly associated with the gmrlk18- <dig> allotype  <dig>  <cit>  and that allele in transgenic plants provided partial resistance  <cit> . combined, the amino acid changes  were sufficient to differentiate between plant introductions possessing type i resistance  and four other allotypes. no studies to date have attempted to analyze the role of these amino acid changes on overall protein structure, hence the molecular basis of resistance to scn and sds pathogenesis remains unexplored.

a recent study  <cit>  shed light on secondary structural components of the gmrlk18- <dig> lrr domain. helix and sheet content coincided with an alpha beta structural fold. some unstructured elements within the lrr domain were inferred through circular dichroism  spectrometry. allotype comparisons were not yet made due to inherent refolding problems associated with some lrr proteins. in many instances, protein structure can be predicted by comparison to homologs of known structure  <cit> . for the gmrlk18- <dig> lrr-domain residues 141– <dig> expressed in e. coli <cit>  the nearest orthologs, judged by primary sequence similarity and length, with known structures included; 1ogq_a   <cit> , 3rgx   <cit> , 1xcd_a   <cit> , 1o6s   <cit> ; 1ozn_a   <cit> ; and 2bnh   <cit> .

disregarding the length of the lrr domain, the polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein from phaseolus vulgaris   <cit>  was the closest ortholog of gmrlk18- <dig> with a known structure, sharing  <dig> percent identity and  <dig> percent similarity . next was the bri <dig> receptor  <cit>  that was 27% identical and 42% similar in the lrr region . the pri protein  <cit>  shared 20% identity and 36% similarity with the gmrlk18-1-lrr, was of similar length and was known to form homo-dimers in vivo. among well studied plant rlk-r proteins the lrr of gmrlk18- <dig> was most similar  to the rice xa <dig> receptor kinase lrr  <cit> . xa <dig> is a rlk, the extra-cellular domain of which controls race specific pathogen recognition in response to a known elicitor. the binding of the pathogen ligand to the xa <dig> lrr-domain may result in dimerization and activation of intracellular kinase. among genes involved in the control of development the gmrlk18- <dig> lrr domain was 43% similar to arabidopsis clavata <dig> and clavata <dig> that heterodimerize  <cit> . the gmrlk18- <dig> lrr domain was 45% similar to soybean nark <dig>  <cit> . these latter  <dig> proteins have been shown to bind cle peptides as part of their activity. there is a cle peptide in nematode secretions that was shown to be perceived by rlks in the clavata <dig> and coryne families  <cit>  raising the possibility that gmrlk18- <dig> might bind cle peptides. binding constants  for cle peptides were reported in the range of  <dig> - <dig>  nm.

previously a three dimensional model for an rpk protein  <cit>  was predicted but the modeled rpk protein was not an rlk. equally, a model for and rlk was predicted, but the protein acted in symbiosis not defense  <cit> . here a model of the lrr domain from a rlk protein involved in resistance is reported based on homology modeling of the extracellular lrr domain  of the gmrlk18- <dig> protein. modeling for gmrlk18-1-lrr was based on pri   <cit> . the effect of the amino acid substitutions on protein stability was inferred; structure for fold and class analysis was made; and secondary structure was analyzed in vitro and in silico to predict whether gmrlk18- <dig> may homo-dimerize in vivo. the models were tested with proteins cross linked in vitro. ligand binding was measured with short cle-like peptides.

RESULTS
analyses of protein sequences
the gmrlk18-1-lrr domain showed diverged motifs but in a regularly repeating pattern   <cit> . conversely, the kinase domain contained the expected conserved motifs and therefore appeared to have experienced purifying selection. the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates in both these domains differed as well . eight of the nine known alleles of the rlk at the rhg <dig> locus  <cit>  were aligned using clustal-w and rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions determined. the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions in the lrr-domain was observed to be about 1: <dig> whereas in the kinase domain, most nucleotide substitutions did not translate into amino acid changes and the ratio exceeded 3: <dig>  the ratios suggest purifying selection eliminated mutants in the kinase domain but not the lrr domain. the relative lack of amino acid sequence variance per nucleotide change may be associated with the role of the kinase domain in the signaling function. appropriate message transduction imposes severe constraints on amino acid substitutions. in contrast, the lrr-domains may be expected to accumulate mutations that are neutral, improve the current function or lead to new adaptive recognition capabilities.

detection of homo-dimers for gmrlk18- <dig> but not gmrlk08-1
the lrr domains of gmrlk18- <dig> and gmrlk08- <dig> were expressed in e. coli by the same methods. native page gels consistently showed  <dig> bands of  <dig>  kd and  <dig> kd for gmrlk18- <dig>  but only a single bands at  <dig>  kd for gmrlk08- <dig> . the  <dig>  kd bands could be eluted and electrophoresed on sds-page where the apparent size was halved to  <dig>  kd by denaturation. proteins extracted from plant roots and subject to non-denaturing page and western transfer also appeared capable of maintaining homo-dimers and/or forming a hetero-dimers with another protein of similar mass and charge . the predicted monomer band at  <dig>  kd electrophoresed more slowly than expected relative to the globular marker proteins as did the predicted homo-dimer  <dig>  kd band. non-denaturing electrophoresis of proteins provides inaccurate estimates of size based on size and charge density. in this case the very low abundance rlk was a refolded protein following solubilization from the membrane bound fraction. possibly the exposed trans-membrane domain or other unstructured elements reduced the rate of the proteins migration.

cross-linking between homodimers in gmrlk18- <dig> but not gmrlk08-1
from cross-linking with mtbs it was found that within  <dig> ao from c <dig> to adjacent amino acids two sets of ion signals were observed which may both be assigned to the same region of a homodimer. the two biotinylated, trypsin digest derived, peptides that resulted from cross-linking started from residue  <dig> and ended with residue  <dig>  and started with residue  <dig> and ended with residue  <dig> . this means that c <dig> in the lrr or c <dig> in the whole protein are adjacent  to the region containing the h274n polymorphism . therefore, the monomers are predicted to overlay one another but be offset by 79– <dig> residues. it should be noted that c <dig> would be close to one of the two intrinsically unstructured regions predicted. also note in this structure the  <dig> of the  <dig> negatively charged residues  are predicted to be paired with  <dig> of the  <dig> positively charged residues  which causes the pi of the homodimer formed from the lrr domain expressed in e. coli to be nearly neutral  rather than the pi  <dig> measured for the monomer  <cit> . in contrast there was no cross-linking with gm08-rlk <dig> or the protein free controls

gmrlk18- <dig> contained intrinsically unstructured elements
circular dichroism spectroscopy of the refolded protein from the lrr domain was used to ensure the expressed proteins had refolded adequately. in fact the spectra showed most of the proteins were well folded but with spectra characteristic of interrupting and unstructured regions within the lrr domain   <cit> . cd showed a mixed secondary structure content . interestingly,  <dig> percent of the lrr protein was predicted unordered or unstructured  <cit> . the unstructured regions intervene splitting the lrr domain in two. the intervening regions may underlie the difficulty in maintaining lrr solubility in vitro and alter the migration pattern during electrophoresis in non-denaturing gels.

cle peptide ligand binding by the lrr domain
the affinity of binding for two lrr domain proteins, gmrlk18- <dig> and gmrlk08- <dig> was measured with a set of  <dig> consensus motif peptides  found among the cle gene family expressed in soybean roots  <cit> . in addition, one cle domain found in nematode secretions was tested. as a control the peptide used to raise the anti-rlk <dig> antibody was tested in the same assay. it contained an lrr repeat unique to the gmrlk18- <dig> class of proteins. there were  <dig> separate motifs among the eight gmcle peptides as  <dig> of the motifs were present in short  or long peptides  in the plant secretome. the gmrlk18-1-lrr had highest affinity for short peptides in general  and longer peptides were 2– <dig> fold less strongly bound. peptides gmcle <dig>  and t  were bound most strongly followed by clv <dig> and its nematode ortholog n . these binding constants were within physiological ranges and suggest the lrr domain can bind multiple peptide ligands. each of the ligands was found in vivo as part of a signal cascade that alters plant development  <cit> . in contrast, to the set of peptides associated with developmental controls, the peptides involved in the control of nodule symbiosis gmric <dig> and gmnic <dig>  were bound weakly by the gmrlk18- <dig> derived lrr peptide.

consensus sequences within the peptides were underlined. dashed underline was the lrr peptide fragment used to estimate the kd of dimerization and to raise the anti-gm18rlk- <dig> antibody. complete annotations can be found in  <cit> . binding constants were calculated from titration experiments.

the gmrlk08- <dig> lrr domain  showed a lower affinity for most of the cle peptides tested . however, the long and short versions of gmcle <dig> and short version of gmclv <dig> bound with the highest affinity  suggesting these were among the ligand signals integrated by gmrlk08- <dig>  the nematode peptide hgclv <dig> was bound weakly . this result would agree with the conclusion that gmrlk08- <dig> protein was not the sole element underlying the resistance reaction encoded at the rhg <dig> locus  <cit> . the gmrlk08- <dig> lrr domain protein bound very weakly to the symbiosis associated gmric and gmnic, as did gmrlk18- <dig>  unlike gmrlk18- <dig> the gmrlk08- <dig> protein bound weakly to gmtdif. therefore, the lrrs showed distinct peptide ligand specificities reflecting their different sequence and structures.

estimates of the kd for lrr domain dimerization could be made from the peptide l which contained one lrr motif. the apparent kd for dimerization of  <dig> nm for this region would suggest the whole domain homo-dimerization constant be less than that. in vitro both proteins extracted from roots and lrr domain peptides solubilized from e. coli showed evidence that about half the proteins existed as monomers and about half as homo-dimers . this equilibrium is maintained across a wide range of concentrations of protein and salt. it will be of interest in future to see if ligand binding can alter this equilibrium.

whole protein ligand binding by the lrr in far western analyses
far western analyses of total root proteins separated on  <dig> d gels showed a single interacting partner was detected that was different at  <dig> and  <dig> dai with scn . at  <dig> dai  the feeding site has just developed and the resistance reaction has begun. the only protein avidly bound to the lrr at this stage was a cyclophilin, with 24% identical peptide matches to  <dig> regions of gi  <dig> , with score of  <dig> and expect value of 1e- <dig>  the cyclophilin protein was  <dig> amino acids long and was found on the gel as expected from dna derived amino-acid sequence prediction at  <dig>  d and pi  <dig>  . the abundance of the protein spot did not change either in response to scn inoculation, f. virguliforme inoculation or plant genotype here or in earlier studies  <cit> .

by  <dig> dai  cysts were mature  or mostly dead . the protein binding most strongly to the lrr domain was a secreted methionine synthase from soybean. the methionine synthase protein  at  <dig>  kda and pi  <dig>  was the strongest interacting partner . the abundance of the protein spot did not change either in response to scn inoculation, f. virguliforme inoculation or plant genotype here or at  <dig> dai  <cit> .

proteins that contained cle motifs were not detected at either time point . the clv <dig> like proteins in soybean range in size from  <dig> - <dig>  d and pi  <dig> - <dig>  but the active peptide ligands are much smaller , not abundant and so would not be present on the 2d gels.

discussion
shown here were the structures and abundances of proteins that interact with the lrr of gmrlk18- <dig> <cit> . in addition distances between homodimer subunits were mapped and measured with established techniques  <cit> . these experimental data will be compared with models  <cit>  based on homologies in this discussion.

structure and function
the lrr domain of gmrlk18- <dig> was shown to tend towards homo-dimerization or ligand binding with equal avidity. unstructured regions were detected within it. more than  <dig> percent of human proteins have unstructured regions within them  <cit> . unstructured proteins offer advantages over globular/fixed proteins by potentiating low affinity transient interactions with a number of targets   <cit> . it is likely that the binding of interacting partners or pathogen effectors dictate rhg lrr domain structure. many examples in cell cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation and cell signaling involve unstructured proteins. these include bri <dig>  <cit>  zinc-fingers, the actr cofactor in tumor development and the p <dig> involved in cell-cycle control  <cit> . unlike structured proteins, most unstructured proteins have low affinities for their partners  <cit> . this may provide plasticity in cells needing a swift response to external or internal stimuli.

peptide ligand binding and phenotypic effects
cle-like protein derived consensus peptides are defined set of peptides found in plant genomes and involved in both short and long distance signaling  <cit> . five of the  <dig> consensus motifs found among cle peptides are expressed in roots , as was the gmrlk18- <dig>  the gmrlk18- <dig> lrr domain had a strong binding constant for gmclv <dig> and n that are thought to be involved in meristem differentiation  <cit> . during scn pathogenesis a new meristem is initiated to bring a tracheary element close to the feeding site, n might mediate that and be detected by the resistance protein gmrlk18- <dig>  t is the tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor  that might provide inhibition of feeding site induced developmental processes during defence. gmcle <dig> peptides were produced in pro-vascular tissues  <cit> . cle domains thought to be involved in symbiosis  <cit>  were not strongly bound suggesting they were not ligands of physiological relevance, although nematode parasitism does decrease nodulation  <cit> .

in order to determine whether cle peptide binding would have an effect in planta twelve plants were used for a root dip assay. scn susceptible plants that had been infested with hgtype  <dig>  were depotted at  <dig> dai and a  <dig> g root sample taken. roots were then dipped in cle peptide tgif or hgcle in water at  <dig> pm concentration and returned to the infested soil. immediate wilt was observed among the plants dipped in cle peptides but not the water controls . wilting and stem bending was more severe in x <dig>  plants that westag  <dig>  plants. within one hour of dipping in cle peptide stem bending was observed  and maintained, though compensated for with an s bend in x <dig> plants, until roots were harvested at  <dig> dai . the roots were harvested  <dig> days after cle peptide treatments and the number of cyst counted . the plants dipped in cle peptides showed significantly lower numbers of scn females suggesting a resistance reaction had been induced.

scn female index in greenhouse grown seedlings at  <dig> days after scn infestations. pots were watered daily with  <dig> ml. female index  was the mean percentage of cysts of hg type  <dig> found on five plants per repetition compared to a susceptible genotype essex. plant treated with cle peptides received  <dig> pm dip treatments with hgcle or gmtdif.

protein ligand binding
the cyclophilin detected  was one of thirty encoded in the soybean genome suggesting it was a specific rhg1/rfs <dig> interacting partner. a role in pathogenesis for cyclophilins would be in agreement with  <cit> . the roles of cyclophilins include small molecule binding and receptor interactions  <cit> . the cyclophilin may induce a structural change in the lrr-domain probably by peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity .

in a second far western analysis using older roots  later in the infection process  an s-adenosyl-l-methionine synthase was detected . methionine synthase is increased in abundance and found in the secretome during fungal pathogenesis of plants  <cit> . methionine synthase has a well-defined role in defense as a provider of a supply of methyl units. recent experiments have shown that during infection of diploid wheat  by the fungus blumaria graminis f. sp. tritici there was a rapid synthesis of  <dig> proteins that are involved in the pathways of biosynthesis and supply of methyl units to lignol biosynthesis  <cit> . methionine synthase was one of the genes shown to be highly induced at an early phase of infection in the epidermis. the expression was linked to host cell wall apposition formation and suggested that the pathways for synthesis of methyl units are transcriptionally activated and that this activation was for the host defense response. cell wall appositions form during the late stages of the scn resistance reaction in g. max <cit> . another possible role for methylation is that arginines in the lrr may be methylated during pathogen responses. alternately it may be indirectly linked to developmental control during pathogenesis by altering the site and amount of ethylene production  <cit> .

gmrlk18- <dig> models
to understand structure-function details for gmrlk18- <dig>  a three dimensional structural model was constructed. the generated model employed homology as well as ab initio predictions. the model endeavors were difficult as the most suitable tertiary structure homolog had low homology to gmrlk18- <dig>  consequently ab initio modeling was used in the final structural prediction. pri  <cit>  was used as the template structure  from among the top hits generated by the 3d jury server. pri was a  <dig> residue leucine rich repeat protein with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. the protein interacts and forms tight complexes with certain ribonucleases. structure prediction was based on algorithms which select near-native conformations on the basis of discriminatory scoring functions. the models were first generated at 4– <dig> Å rmsd using the amino terminus domain of gmrlk18- <dig> , which encompassed the lrr structural motif. in scop database the lrr domain  was divided into  <dig> super families;  pri-like ;  l-domain like ; and  both outer-arm dynein light chain-like and pgip-like . gmrlk18- <dig> was predicted to be both pri-like and pgip-like. several knowledge-based scoring functions have been developed with varying degrees of success  <cit> . these functions usually compile statistics from databases that contain experimentally determined structures, and use such statistics to test the probability of a given conformation to be native-like. proteins of intermediate structure between two super-families often confound the programs.

model validation
prochecktm analysis of the lrr domain of gmrlk18- <dig> showed that most stereochemical parameters fell within accepted values for structures with resolution of  <dig>  Å . as a resolution value cannot be assigned to the predicted structure of gmrlk18- <dig>  the values are for comparison purposes only. ramachandran plots for the model showed approximately  <dig> percent of residues in most favored regions and  <dig> percent of residues in allowed regions. less than  <dig> percent  of the residues were in disallowed regions on the ramachandran plot .

the procheck analyses of the crystal structure of pri  showed approximately  <dig> percent of the residues were in the most favorable regions and  <dig> percent in additionally favorable regions. therefore, about 10% of most favored residues present in the template were lost during gmrlk18- <dig> model generation.

the model suggested that the lrr domain of gmrlk18- <dig>  adopts a horse-shoe type architecture similar to the crystal structure of pri and unlike the solenoid structure of monomeric bri <dig>  <cit> . in both the template and modeled protein, the long ß sheets are parallel to the helices present on the inner circumference of the proteins. in gmrlk18- <dig>  the helices and sheets were joined by loops. further, the n and c terminal helices were longer and the shorter helices were evenly spaced in the repeats .

the lack of motif conservation in known lrr domains  <cit>  suggested that lrrs involved in pathogen recognition have a greater need to adapt to the constantly changing pathogen population. some structural elements mainly helices, present in the template pri structure  <cit>  were missing in the gmrlk18-1-lrr protein . surprisingly the loss of helical contact seems to be at odd numbered helical turns in the solenoid protein .

gmrlk18- <dig> lrr modeled as a crystal homo-dimer
native page of gmrlk18- <dig> showed a monomer as well as a homo-dimer band . therefore, the gmrlk18-1-lrr protein was modeled as a crystal homo-dimer . this modeling was based on either the crystal dimer from decorin template  <cit>  or an amino-peptidase or the ri dimer complexed with angiogenin   <cit> . the model developed based on the ri dimer agreed with the experimental evidence from mtbs cross-linking and was shown in figure  <dig>  the models based on decorin and the amino-peptidase did not agree with experimental data and was rejected. briefly, from cross-linking from c <dig> two biotinylated, trypsin digest derived, two peptides from one region of a homo-dimer resulted from cross-linking. this means that c <dig> in the lrr or c <dig> in the whole protein were adjacent  to the region containing the h274n polymorphism . therefore, the monomers are predicted to overlay one another but be offset by 79– <dig> residues. it should be noted that c <dig> would be close to one of the two intrinsically unstructured regions predicted. also note in this structure the  <dig> of the  <dig> negatively charged residues  are predicted to be paired with  <dig> of the  <dig> positively charged residues . that would cause the pi of the homodimer formed from the lrr domain expressed in e. coli to be nearly neutral. neutral proteins have been detected in non-denaturing pi measurements using the diabla assay systems   <cit>  rather than the pi  <dig> measured for the monomer   <cit> .

xa <dig>  one of the closest homologs of the gmrlk18-1-lrr was believed to function via homo-dimer formation  <cit> . other lrrs implicated in development have also been reported to homo-dimerize. for instance, an in vivo study of the arabidopsis somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  showed evidence of a serk homo-dimer whilst clv <dig> lrr domain heterodimerizes with clv <dig> lrr domain , though  <dig> these  <dig> residues were absent from the lrr fragment expressed in e. coli.

halplotype and allotype analysis of gmrlk18-1
previously a perfect association between allele  <dig>  and resistance to the scn  was shown in three segregating populations and an association study of unrelated pis  <cit> . recently, previously susceptible plants transgenic with the forrest allele of gmrlk18- <dig> were found to be resistant to both scn and sds  <cit> . based on multiple sequence alignment of predicted gmrlk18- <dig> haplotypes, a quantitative trait nucleotide in the lrr of rhg <dig> was inferred, that alters a <dig> to v <dig> in the context of q <dig> and h <dig> rather than k <dig> and n <dig> . there is a closely linked copy number variation that may also contribute to resistance  <cit> .

effects of the non synonymous point mutations on the rlk extracellular domain protein monomer stability was analyzed using the fold x algorithm   <cit> . of the  <dig> mutations that could discriminate between resistant and susceptible rhg <dig> alleles, the a to v substitution at amino acid  <dig> was predicted to make the most significant change to the free energy of folding . the changes q to k at position  <dig> and h to n at position  <dig> have an opposite effect on protein stability. however, the predicted absolute folding free energy values are not usually accurate compared to proteins with determined structures. hence the absolute values were of little significance and only the values obtained from free energy differences between the  <dig> mutants and the wild type structure were used for relative comparisons. functionally important residues in the gmrlk18-1-lrr were also distinguished from structural residues using a recently developed algorithm  <cit> . each residue in the gmrlk18- <dig> lrr protein was analyzed on the basis of  a sequence conservation score based on multiple sequence protein alignment and  the free energy difference between the naturally occurring residue and the potentially optimal residue at that position. the analysis showed that the alanine residue at position  <dig> was the optimal residue in addition to the naturally occurring residue in the peking cultivar. both these results suggest that alanine  <dig> may be involved in providing stability to the protein. the remaining  <dig> amino acid substitutions may have an effect on the stability of the protein dimer.

CONCLUSIONS
this report describes a functional analysis and structural prediction of the lrr domain from a rlk protein involved in plant pest and disease resistance. structural predictions were made and validated. the results showed that the isolated lrr of gmrlk18- <dig> binds peptides found in both nematode and plant secretions with high affinity. a question might arise over whether isolated lrrs behave in the same way as in whole rlks and rpks. however, the lrr was previously shown to form an active structure by cd  <cit> . homo-dimerization was detected in  <dig> different assays  and the avidity estimated by a peptide binding assay. larger proteins were also shown to bind the lrr domain including cyclophilin, methionine synthase and a protein of the same mass and charge as the rlk monomer. therefore, the isolate lrr behaved in ways similar to the rlk. the lrr domain was large and appeared to be binding different ligands. the rlk might integrate those signals into a single appropriate response.

the predicted structure of the rlk contrasted with the template pri or monomeric bri <dig> in a number of ways. first, the predicted model lacks some of the successive alpha helical regions present in pri and bri <dig>  this may account for the unstructured content that was determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. secondly, it was predicted that the n terminal helical repeats were longer whereas the internal helical regions were evenly placed throughout the protein. in most other aspects, the model was very similar to the pri template. future predictions may be based on plant rlk homo-dimers of similar lengths if any structures become available or if the gmrlk18- <dig> homo-dimer can be crystallized. in the absence of that the prediction employed here can be used for extensive structure refinement by further cross-linking experiments.

some important features of the candidate gmrlk18- <dig> protein were predicted and validated. the three polymorphisms to the c-terminal side, a87v, q115k, and h274n may affect protein stability. the quantitative trait nucleotide underlying h274n that differentiates the peking allotype  from all others may have structural or functional significance. that amino acid polymorphism, h274n, may play an important role in the stability of the monomer as well as the homo-dimer. future experiments will involve mutation of this amino acid and correlating it with gmrlk18- <dig> stability and/or function in binding the cle like peptide motifs found in all plants and their many of their pathogens  <cit> .
