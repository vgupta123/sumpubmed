BACKGROUND
higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria absorb light energy to drive oxygenic photosynthesis. light harvesting is the first step in the photosynthetic process and is mediated by pigment-binding proteins forming light-harvesting antenna systems. however, excess light can be harmful and can lead to protein damage due to the formation of reactive oxygen species , establishing a strong evolutionary pressure on photosynthetic organisms to develop potent photoprotective mechanisms  <cit> . both functions, light harvesting and photoacclimation/photoprotection are mediated by members of the extended light-harvesting complex  protein superfamily in photosynthetic eukaryotes  <cit> . the eukaryotic members of the extended lhc protein superfamily have a common origin and evolved from a cyanobacterial one-helix ancestor with a characteristic chlorophyll-binding motif that is strongly conserved across the entire extended lhc protein super family  <cit> . apart from lhc superfamily proteins also other proteins are known to bind chlorophyll, examples are the prochlorophyte chl a/b binding proteins  <cit>  or the isia chlorophyll-binding protein in cyanobacteria  <cit> . the chlorophyll binding motifs of these proteins are non-homologous to motifs found in the lhc protein super family  <cit> .

eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms evolved by the uptake of an ancient cyanobacterium and the subsequent reduction of the endosymbiont to an organelle. soon after the evolution of primary plastids, photosynthetic eukaryotes split into three lineages, chlorophytes , rhodophytes  and glaucophytes  <cit> . during this process, structure and composition of the light-harvesting systems changed: phycobilisomes, the main light harvesting systems in cyanobacteria, were lost in chlorophytes and their function was taken over by members of the extended lhc protein superfamily. rhodophytes and glaucophytes, however, retained phycobilisomes as a part of their light-harvesting machineries  <cit> .

diatoms and cryptophytes  evolved via secondary endocytobiosis, the uptake of a eukaryotic alga into a eukaryotic host cell  <cit> , with the secondary endosymbiont being phylogenetically related to recent red algae  <cit> . red algae and algae with secondary plastids of red algal origin are therefore often collectively referred to as the “red lineage” of photosynthetic eukaryotes, opposed to the “green lineage” .

interestingly, also secondary endocytobiosis led to drastic changes in structure and function of the light-harvesting systems in the red lineage. in cryptophytes, phycobilins are present, however they are not organised in phycobilisomes, while diatoms exclusively use lhc superfamily proteins for light harvesting  <cit> .

across all recent bacterial and eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms, the extended lhc protein superfamily consists of the lhc, lhc-like and psbs protein families. the lhc protein family in the red lineage is represented by lhcr proteins present in red algae , chlorophyll  a/c-binding  proteins present in algal groups with secondary plastids of red algal origin, also called fucoxanthin cac proteins  or lhcf  in diatoms and brown algae, li <dig>  called also lhcx in diatoms, and a less known clade, lhcz, described for some algae with complex plastids  <cit> . in the green lineage, the lhc protein family is represented by chl a/b-binding  proteins and li <dig>  also called lhcsr in green algae  <cit> .

the lhc-like protein family is divided into early light-induced proteins , stress-enhanced proteins  proteins), one-helix proteins , and high light  intensity-inducible lhc-like  <dig>  proteins  <cit> . while elips and lhl <dig> are found exclusively in the green lineage, seps and ohps are shared between red and green algae  <cit> . two types of ohps can be distinguished: the ohp1/hlip-type present in cyanophages, cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes and the ohp2-type restricted to eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . members of the psbs protein family are present only in the green lineage  <cit> .

proteins from the cac, lhcr and cab protein families mainly fulfill a light harvesting function, while members of the lhc-like, li818/lhcx/lhcsr, psbs and lhl <dig> families are mainly involved in photoprotection and photoacclimation. it was proposed that these proteins play a role in the regulation of chl and tocopherol biosynthesis, participate in the transient binding of released free chlorophylls, thus preventing the formation of ros, and act as a sink for excessive excitation energy in a process called non-photochemical quenching   <cit> .

four novel sequences belonging to the extended lhc protein superfamily were recently reported from the red algae galdieria sulphuraria and griffithsia japonica and from the two diatoms phaeodactylum tricornutum and thalassiosira pseudonana <cit> . based on sequence similarity  and predicted secondary structure  these sequences did not fall into any of the previously described extended lhc protein superfamily groups but formed a new group instead, termed red lineage cab-like proteins   <cit> . here, we elucidate the taxonomic distribution, phylogeny, localisation, expression and potential function of these not yet characterised redcaps.

RESULTS
taxonomic distribution of redcaps
to investigate the taxonomic distribution of redcap sequences, we searched publicly available expressed sequence tag  and genomic databases and found orthologs in cryptophyta, haptophyta, heterokontophyta  and rhodophyta. no redcap sequences were found in organisms of the green lineage of photosynthetic eukaryotes, while genomes from organisms of the red lineage of photosynthetic eukaryotes were generally found to encode redcaps . thus, the presence of redcaps is restricted to red algae and photosynthetic chromista with secondary plastids of red algal origin .

interestingly, in contrast to members of the lhc and lhc-like families, but similar to the psbs family, almost all identified redcaps are encoded by single-copy genes. the only possible exceptions are the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi which possesses an additional, possibly degenerated redcap sequence  and the red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae, which apparently does not possess a redcap gene, possibly due to its overall highly reduced genome  <cit> .

unique phylogenetic position of redcaps within the extended lhc protein superfamily
first we analysed redcap sequences in order to resolve their phylogenetic position among the three- and four-helix protein families of the extended lhc protein superfamily. we used the conserved chl-binding motif present in helices i and iii and obtained a sequence alignment that consists of  <dig> amino acid positions ),  <dig> out of the  <dig> amino acid positions are not fixed and polymorph in more than one taxon and hereby contribute to the phylogenetic information in the analysis.

alignments of redcap amino acid sequences with three-helix members from the extended lhc protein superfamily present in the red  and green  algal lineages confirmed their distinct primary and secondary structure  and , see additional file 3). in all three-helix members of the lhc protein superfamily investigated so far only helices i and iii are conserved while helix ii shows much lower sequence conservation; in contrast to this, sequence conservation also occurred in the second helix of redcaps from different organisms , see additional file 3). this conserved region also included residues that might be involved in pigment binding . pigment binding depends on the three dimensional folding of the actual protein  and the protein/lipid surrounding of the folded protein; so it is difficult to predict. overall, there were fewer potential pigment binding sites in redcaps than in lhcs, which might indicate that redcaps are possibly less chlorophyll loaded than lhcs and possibly fulfill a different function.

the alignment was also used to build a phylogenetic tree , the redcap sequences clearly clustered together and formed a well-defined, monophyletic clade within the extended lhc protein superfamily. this pattern was also observed in an analysis of the extended lhc protein superfamily based on the first chl-binding helix including one- and two-helix lhc-like proteins . therefore, not only the differences in the second transmembrane helix, but also the ones in helices i and iii placed redcaps into a clade distinct to that of lhcs.

in a phylogenetic analysis of all currently available redcap sequences , the expected species tree with red algae and algae with complex plastids as sister groups was recovered to some detail . this implies that the evolution of redcaps apparently did not involve the emergence of paralogous gene copies  and that no horizontal gene transfer events could be detected within algae with secondary plastids of the red lineage.

based on primary sequence similarities, conservation patterns  and phylogenetic analyses , redcaps formed a distinct family within the extended lhc protein superfamily that was neither more closely related to other three-helix families, like lhc, lhc-like or lhl <dig>  nor to the four-helix psbs family.

complex evolutionary history of redcap genes
evolutionary studies indicate that all lhc superfamily members have a common origin and arose from an cyanobacterial one-helix hlip-like protein ancestor  <cit> . the hlip/ohp1-like sequences were likely at the origin of the nuclear-encoded ohp <dig>  ohp <dig> and sep in the green or ohp <dig> and sep in the red algal lineage   <cit> . in the green lineage, the ancestral hlip/ohp1-like sequences were lost, whereas in the red lineage hlip/ohp1-like sequences can be found, encoded either on the plastid or the nuclear genomes .

remarkably, all lhc protein superfamily members with more than one transmembrane helix containing chlorophyll binding motifs were exclusively found in eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms and are encoded on the nuclear genomes, which implies that they evolved after the endosymbiotic gene transfer from the cyanobacterial genome to the nuclear genomes of the ancestors of chlorophytes, rhodophytes and glaucophytes . the ancestor of lhcr/cab or elips and redcaps in green or red algae, respectively, evolved by independent, internal gene duplication, likely from different sep groups after the initial gene transfer  <cit> .

after secondary endocytobiosis, lhcr genes were transferred to the nucleus of the secondary host cell and gave rise to lhcf and cac genes in heterokontophyta and cryptophyta, respectively  <cit> . similarly, redcap and sep genes were transferred to the host nucleus in heterokontophyta and cryptophyta . comparing the location of hlip/ohp1-like and ohp <dig> genes a striking difference between heterokontophyta and cryptophyta became apparent; while in heterokontophyta, hlip/ohp1-like and ohp <dig> genes have been transferred to the nuclear genomes and subsequently got lost from the secondary endosymbiont genome , hlip/ohp1-like and ohp <dig> sequences were not transferred to the nucleus in cryptophytes, instead they can still be found on the plastid or nucleomorph genomes, respectively  .

redcaps are targeted to the complex plastids of diatoms
all identified redcaps in algae with secondary plastids were nuclear-encoded and include an n-terminal bipartite pre-sequence, consisting of a signal and a transit peptide domain and a conserved “asafap”-motif located at the interface between both domains, which is required for import through the four membranes surrounding such plastids  <cit> . this suggests a plastid location of redcaps . to verify the predicted location experimentally, we fused the full-length redcap sequence to the green fluorescent protein  gene  and expressed it in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum. analysis of the gfp signal by confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that this signal co-localised with the red chl autofluorescence , thus confirming a plastid localisation of redcap in diatoms.

similarly, also the nucleus encoded ohp <dig> of p. tricornutum was reported to be targeted to the plastid  <cit>  .

this shows that gene transfers from the nucleus of the secondary endosymbiont to the nucleus of the secondary host cell were accompanied by acquisition of targeting pre-sequences that are suitable to re-target the gene product to its original location. this process is not trivial, since plastid targeting pre-sequences of red algae show completely different features than plastid targeting pre-sequences of diatoms  <cit> , and pre-sequence acquisition is considered to be a crucial step in the evolutionary reduction of organellar genomes  <cit> .

redcaps show a unique expression pattern under light stress conditions
we investigated the expression of the p. tricornutum redcap gene and compared it to the expression of selected members of the lhc and lhc-like families. cells were pre-adapted to low light  at  <dig> h of daily illumination. with the onset of the dark period, cells were either kept in the same condition  or transferred to continuous darkness  or moderate hight light  for one regular  <dig> h illumination period. transcript levels of selected genes were assayed in  <dig> h intervals throughout the following  <dig> h . in the ll condition , lhcf <dig> transcript levels were significantly down-regulated in the dark period and significantly up-regulated in the light period compared to the transcript level at the onset of darkness. this is consistent with previous reports of light dependent diurnal transcript regulation for this gene  <cit> . following a similar pattern, also transcript levels of redcap and ohp1-like  <dig> were significantly up-regulated during the light period and down-regulated  during darkness. a similar expression pattern of redcap upon a shift from d to ll was recently reported  <cit> . in the d condition  the amounts of lhcf <dig> and redcap transcripts were significantly down-regulated, although a transient up-regulation of the transcript level was measured at the time when the light was previously switched on, this effect was also observed  for lhcf <dig> . in the ml condition , redcap and lhcf <dig> transcripts were down-regulated compared to the transcript level at the onset of darkness, independent of the light or dark phase . thus, we can conclude that redcap and lhcf <dig> show a diurnal regulation of the gene expression at ll, which is not maintained in d or under ml illumination. this is in agreement with previous studies showing diurnal regulation of lhcf <dig> genes  <cit>  and with the clustering of the p. tricornutum redcap gene with lhcf and lhcf-like genes in a hierarchical clustering analysis of diatom ests obtained from a range of different environmental conditions  <cit> .

lhcfs were reported to be transcriptionally repressed in response to high light  in the diatom p. tricornutum <cit> , while lhcx are induced by hl in p. tricornutum <cit>  and other diatoms  <cit>  confirming their role in photoprotection  <cit> . the ohps and seps were shown to accumulate in response to hl in arabidopsis thaliana <cit>  but nothing is known about their expression and function in diatoms. to investigate whether redcap is induced in response to hl, we exposed ll-pre-adapted p. tricornutum cells to hl for  <dig> h and transferred them back to ll for recovery for additional  <dig> h. the control cultures were kept at ll for the same amount of time. the transcript levels of redcap, lhcf <dig>  ohp1-like  <dig>  ohp <dig> and sepx were significantly down-regulated after the onset of hl illumination . the observed expression patterns of lhcf <dig> and redcap during a ll to hl shift were similar to the ones reported by nymark et al.  <cit> . the transcript level change of lhcf <dig> during a shift from ll to hl also seems to be reflected by a change of its protein amount  <cit> . for redcap and lhcf <dig>  after  <dig> h of recovery the transcript level remained low, while for ohp1-like  <dig> and ohp <dig>  the transcript level after  <dig> h of recovery was closer to the initial transcript level. in contrast, the transcript level for ohp1-like  <dig> was transiently up-regulated during the first  <dig> min of hl exposure and decreased below the level present in ll-kept culture during recovery . the different expression patterns of ohp1-like  <dig>  ohp <dig> and sepx genes as compared to a. thaliana orthologs  <cit>  suggest that in diatoms, these proteins might perform other functions than photoprotection. a similar down-regulation of hlip/ohp <dig> and ohp <dig> transcripts in response to hl was also reported for the cryptophyte guillardia theta <cit> .

it was recently demonstrated that redcap is associated to photosystem i , together with lhcr and some lhcf, both in centric and in pennate diatoms  <cit> . other studies using different isolation procedures  <cit>  have reported redcaps in the “whole pool” of lhcf complexes which is shared between ps i and photosystem ii   <cit> . these findings might be explained by either 1) loose binding of redcap at the periphery of ps i, although no exact location has been proposed by the recent mapping of the diatom ps i  <cit> , or by 2) loose binding of redcap to the periphery of lhcf complexes that are associated to both photosystems. considering the diurnal and light dependent regulation of the redcap transcript levels , redcap appears not to be light stress-induced and therefore is obviously not involved in hl photoprotection. instead, redcap is a fast responding gene during a shift from prolonged d to ll  <cit>  but not during a shift from hl to ll . redcap was also found under low blue and red light conditions in amounts similar to other lhc related proteins   <cit> . interestingly, lhcf <dig>  which shows a similar light-dependent expression as redcap, was recently proposed to be more closely associated with ps i than with ps ii and to bind fucoxanthin pigments that change the light absorption properties of the lhcf antenna   <cit> . we therefore hypothesise that redcaps might be involved in the light-dependent structural and/or functional reorganisation of the light-harvesting antenna of ps i and/or ps ii in response to d/ll shifts  as diatoms regularly experience in their natural habitats, i.e. the water column, mudflats or sea-ice packs  <cit> . the recent report by nymark et al.  <cit>  shows a deep light-dependent reorganisation of the diatom photosynthetic apparatus during dark-light shift conditions. this also includes components of the carbon metabolism  <cit>  and requires a fine tuning between light , the photosynthetic activity and gene regulations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on the expression pattern of redcap transcripts that resembles that of lhcf <dig> and differs from lhc-like family members as well as based on their localisation in the thylakoid membrane with an association at the periphery of lhcf complexes associated to ps i and ps ii  <cit> , we propose that redcaps act as antenna-associated proteins in diatoms and related algae. there are striking differences in the regulation of photosynthesis between plants and diatoms  <cit> , especially in the structural organisation of the light harvesting antenna systems  <cit> . the orphan phylogenetic position of redcaps together with an expression pattern similar to lhcf <dig> transcripts promote this group as an interesting candidate to explain these differences.

major shifts in the functional organisation of the different light harvesting systems occured in early algal evolution  <cit> . remarkably, in plants as well as in diatoms, phycobilisomes as antenna proteins have been convergently evolutionary replaced by members of the extended lhc protein superfamily. accompanying this process, in green algae and plants, the psbs and lhc-like protein families increased the diversity of subfamilies within the extended lhc protein superfamily  <cit> . our study shows, that also in red algae and algae with secondary plastids of red algal origin the extended lhc protein superfamily diversified, among others, by the evolution of the redcap family.

considering the global significance of diatoms and other algae with secondary plastids of the red lineage in the contemporary oceans  <cit>  and the extraordinary photosynthetic efficiency and the high productivity of these organisms  <cit> , elucidating the exact functional role of redcaps constitutes an important task for future studies.
