BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis mir <dig> family has eight members and is highly conserved in the plant kingdom. it has been identified in  <dig> plant species
 <cit> . mir <dig> is known to repress spl  genes
 <cit> , which are plant-specific transcription factors containing the sbp  box
 <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig> spl genes are targeted by mir156
 <cit> , and in silico full genome analysis showed that no other genes in arabidopsis have the segment complimentary to mir156
 <cit> . some details of the relationship between the mir <dig> regulatory network downstream of spl genes and flowering enhancement and flavonoid metabolism have been revealed
 <cit> . but this is clearly an area of research that still needs strong attention.

diverse and redundant roles of some individual spl genes in plant morphology and development have been reported. the spl genes targeted by mir <dig> can be grouped into four major clades: spl3/spl4/spl <dig>  spl2/spl10/spl <dig>  spl9/spl <dig>  and spl6/spl <dig> <cit> . spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> exhibit partially redundant effects on plant juvenile-to-adult transition
 <cit> . spl <dig> and spl <dig> directly activate mads box genes that promote flowering
 <cit> . in addition, spl <dig> and spl <dig> interchangeably control shoot maturation and leaf initiation
 <cit> . spl <dig> and spl <dig> expression in leaf primordia modulated by mir <dig> affects initiation of new leaves at the shoot apical meristem
 <cit> . spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> were each able to control leaf lamina shape in association with shoot maturation in the reproductive phase
 <cit> . moreover, spl genes  regulate trichome development via direct interaction with mir172
 <cit>  and the myb transcription factor genes trichomeless <dig>  and triptychon 
 <cit> .

increased axillary branching occurs in transgenic arabidopsis lines expressing mir156b under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter 
 <cit> , similar to that observed in loss-of-function max <dig> and max <dig> mutants with lesions in carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, ccd <dig> and ccd <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . these max mutations cause defective biosynthesis of strigolactones; a group of carotenoid-derived hormones that inhibit shoot branching
 <cit> . the morphological similarities between these transgenic and mutant lines suggest a link between mir156b expression and carotenoid metabolism. this was partially confirmed when arabidopsis mir156b was found to enhance carotenoid levels and reproductive shoot branching when expressed in brassica napus <cit> .

in this study, we report on a new arabidopsis activation tagged mutant, sk <dig>  with strongly enhanced expression of mir156b. mir156b-induced spl <dig> suppression was partially responsible for the increased seed carotenoid abundance and altered plant morphology observed in sk <dig>  in addition, we highlight a new spl <dig> feedback loop which controls expression of mir156b, likely via a physical interaction between the spl <dig> sbp domain and the promoter of mir156b.

RESULTS
phenotypes of the sk <dig> mutant
the sk <dig> mutant was selected from an arabidopsis activation-tagged mutant population that was developed using a t-dna construct containing four camv35s enhancers
 <cit> . compared to the parental wild type  col- <dig>  sk <dig> exhibited the following morphological changes: increased numbers of rosette leaves which were slightly pale, smaller and rounder, increased reproductive branching, ectopic expression of trichomes on flower sepals and shoot tips, delayed bolting, severely stunted cauline stems, and decreased flower and silique sizes .

for comparison, we examined the phenotypes of max3- <dig> <cit>  and max4- <dig> <cit>  mutants, which had been confirmed previously to contain defective ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> genes, respectively . in our hands, these max mutants showed increased secondary and tertiary branches , which was consistent with an earlier report that max mutants showed increased inflorescence number compared to wt plants
 <cit> . however the cauline stems of these two max mutants were not significantly stunted as in sk <dig>  the branching pattern of sk <dig> was also somewhat distinct compared with max mutants; sk <dig> had more quaternary and quinary branches and the max mutants mainly had increased secondary and tertiary branches.

the abundance of five major carotenoid compounds was examined in the mature seeds and leaves of sk <dig> and wt plants. levels of lutein, β-carotene, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin were  <dig> -,  <dig> ,  <dig> -, and  <dig> - fold higher in sk <dig> seeds than in wt seeds . slight decreases  in the levels of major carotenoids in leaves were found in sk <dig> compared to wt . cryptoxanthin was undetectable in either tissue of the mutant, but present at  <dig>  μg g- <dig> fw  in wt seeds and 4-fold higher in wt leaves.

molecular analysis of sk156
segregation analysis of heterozygous sk <dig> mutant offspring revealed that the ratio of resistant-to-sensitive seedlings  was well within the expected 3: <dig> ratio , indicating that there was a single t-dna insertion site. this was confirmed by southern blot analysis . sequencing of the t-dna-flanking regions indicated that the t-dna was located in at4g <dig> , which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix  family protein bhlh069
 <cit> . camv 35s enhancers in the t-dna were within close proximity to five other gene loci: at4g <dig> , at4g <dig> , at4g <dig>  and at4g <dig> .

the sk <dig> phenotypes were dominant when crossed with wt, suggesting that the altered phenotypes in sk <dig> were tightly linked to enhanced expression of gene adjacent to the t-dna, rather than gene disruption. thus, transcript levels of genes close to the t-dna insertion site were compared in the mutant and wt plants using quantitative rt-pcr. transcript levels of at4g <dig>  and the unknown rna gene at4g <dig> were increased  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold , respectively, in sk <dig> , while the t-dna-disrupted at4g <dig>  was repressed  <dig> -fold . no significant changes in transcript levels were detected for the other adjacent genes . this indicated that the four cavm 35s enhancers inserted into bhlh <dig> caused the activation of mir156b and the unknown rna gene.

to determine which of the three t-dna affected genes was responsible for the altered phenotypes in sk <dig>  including enhanced seed carotenoid levels, four types of plants were obtained and examined . these included a bhlh <dig> knockout mutant s <dig>  , transgenic sk <dig> over-expressing a 35s:bhlh <dig> cdna  transgenic wt carrying 35s:at4g <dig> cassette  , and transgenic arabidopsis wt carrying a 35s:mir156b cassette  
 <cit> . transcript analysis showed that expression of bhlh <dig> was defective in both s <dig> and sk <dig> but enhanced in sk <dig> over-expressing bhlh <dig> . morphology was indistinguishable between sk <dig> and sk <dig> over-expressing bhlh <dig>  and between the salk mutant and wt . additionally, over-expression of the unknown rna cdna in wt   did not produce the sk <dig> mutant phenotype . however, the 35s promoter-driven mir156b overexpression resulted in morphological characteristics in line t156b similar to those of sk <dig> .

carotenoid analysis further confirmed the role of enhanced mir156b expression in generating the sk <dig> phenotypes . no significant differences in seed carotenoid abundance were found between the defective bhlh <dig> mutant s <dig> and wt . complementation of sk <dig> with bhlh <dig> did not restore sk <dig> seed carotenoid levels back to wt levels, nor did over-expression of the unknown rna in wt result in enhanced seed carotenoid levels. only in line t156b overexpressing mir156b were seed carotenoid levels raised to levels found in sk <dig> seeds . these data clearly indicate a role for mir156b in the phenotypes of sk <dig> 

due to similar enhanced transcript levels of mir156b and at4g <dig> in the sk <dig> mutant, yet unchanged morphology and seed carotenoid accumulation in the at4g <dig> over-expression lines , we examined the relationship between mir156b transcripts and at4g <dig> cdna. these two transcripts are separated by a  <dig> bp intergenic fragment . sequencing of cdna obtained from the leaves of 4-week-old wt plants revealed a mir156b transcript which included both the  <dig> bp fragment and the full segment of the at4g <dig> transcript . these data show that enhanced expression of mir <dig> is the reason for the phenotypic changes in the sk <dig> mutant line, regardless of at4g <dig> co-transcription.

suppression of spl <dig> is involved in the sk <dig> phenotype
arabidopsis columbia has  <dig> spl genes  that are regulated by mir156
 <cit> . to determine which spl geneswere most likely involved in altered carotenoid profiles of sk <dig> seeds, mutant lines with confirmed t-dna insertion knockouts for all mir156-target spl genes  were obtained . the mutant lines were compared for morphology and carotenoid differences with their corresponding ecotype columbia and wassilevskija controls. while levels of carotenoids were modestly increased in three spl <dig> mutant lines , they were less affected in the remaining spl mutants . even in the spl <dig> mutant lines, the enhanced total carotenoid levels   were not as high as the sum of each individual carotenoid compound observed in sk <dig>  .

the three different spl <dig> “knockout” mutants, cs <dig>  cs <dig> and salk_ <dig>  all exhibited reduced spl <dig> transcript levels similar to levels found in the sk <dig> mutant and the mir156b over-expression line t156b . however, other spl mutants had normal cauline stem lengths , while spl <dig> mutants had slightly stunted stems  as reported previously
 <cit> . assays using rapid amplification of 5' complementary dna ends  indicated that three cleavage sites exist within the region of the native spl <dig> transcript that is complementary to the mir <dig> mature sequence, with one site being used more frequently than the other two . collectively, these results suggest that spl <dig> is a direct target of mir <dig> and that it plays a role in the morphology and seed carotenoid phenotypes found in sk <dig> mutant line.

expression of mir156-insensitive spl15m affects the phenotype of sk156
since spl <dig> mutants had several phenotypes similar to those of sk <dig>  two different spl15-complemented sk <dig> lines were developed to determine whether the wt phenotype could be restored in a mir156b-enhanced sk <dig> background . the first transgenic sk <dig> carried a 35s:spl15n  cassette to avoid any endogenous transcriptional regulation which might be present if using a native spl <dig> promoter . the second carried 35s: , which contains  <dig> mutated sites within the spl <dig> segment complementary to mature mir <dig> so that spl15m becomes insensitive to mir <dig> regulation . pcr analysis using gene-specific primers confirmed both pski <dig> t-dna and either spl15n or spl15m within these transgenic lines . sequencing of these pcr products confirmed that all spl15m-expressing lines had a spl15-mutated segment  as expected. spl <dig> transcript levels  within the 35s:spl15m+ lines were increased by  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold compared to wt . no significant differences were found in the amount of lutein, vialoxanthin, zeaxanthin and β-carotene in seeds between these 35s:spl15m-transformed plants and wild type control plants . the transgenic plants showed a largely restored wt morphology in leaf and branch numbers, bolting time, cauline stem length, flower and silique size, and trichome number in reproductive shoots and tissues . only leaf morphology was different between transgenic and non-transgenic lines . this contrasted with mir156-controlled 35s:spl15n+ lines , which displayed sk <dig> phenotypes.

since constitutive expression of spl15m predominantly restored sk <dig> phenotypes, native spl15n and mutated spl15m under the control of the young leaf primordia promoter from the asymmetric leaves  <dig>  gene
 <cit>  were used to generate two additional complemented sets of sk <dig> lines. this was to find out whether spl <dig> functions at the leaf primordia within the shoot apex as occurs with certain spl genes controlling plastochron length
 <cit> . pcr analyses using promoter-specific and gene-specific primers  confirmed the presence of the transgene in these transgenic plants . spl15m transcript levels were increased in as <dig> promoter-driven spl15m transgenic sk <dig> lines, but not in as <dig> promoter-spl15n lines, compared to wt and sk <dig> mutants . as with spl15m expression directed by the 35s promoter, expression of spl15m under the control of the as <dig> promoter in the sk <dig> background restored wt morphology at different growth stages, whereas as1:spl15n did not . moreover, the levels of seed carotenoids in these asi:spl15m plants were not significantly different from those in wt , while seed carotenoid abundance was significantly higher in plants carrying the as1:spl15n cassette  . these changes in the phenotype of transgenic sk <dig> plants expressing the mir156-insensitive as1:spl15m suggested that spl15m could function independently of mir156b and that expression of spl <dig> is effective at the leaf primordia within the shoot apex.

since the native spl15n appeared to be ineffective at restoring the wt phenotype in the enhanced mir156b environment of sk <dig>  another set of complemented sk <dig> lines was generated to express the mir156-insensitive spl15m under the control of the native spl <dig> promoter . morphological traits and carotenoid levels remained unchanged for these transgenic spl15:spl15m plants compared to uncomplemented sk <dig>  except that the leaf shape was similarly elongated as were 35s:spl15m plants compared to wt plants . these data suggested that overwhelming mir156b levels within the sk <dig> mutant negatively regulated the expression of the spl15n under its native promoter and prevented restoration of wt seed carotenoid abundance and plant morphology. moreover, the inability of spl15:spl15m plants to restore most of the wt phenotype as did 35s:spl15m+ lines suggested that the enhanced seed carotenoid level and morphological traits observed in the sk <dig> mutant were the collective result of mir <dig> suppression of at least some other spl genes rather than spl <dig> alone and that spl <dig> functions redundantly with some other spl gene products.

transcription of mir156b is affected by over-expression of spl15m
wu and poethig
 <cit>  reported earlier that expression of mir156-insensitive spl <dig> under the control of the camv35s promoter causes reduced levels of mir <dig> transcripts in arabidopsis. to investigate the ability of spl15m to affect expression of its regulatory mir <dig> genes, we examined mir156b transcript levels in the sk <dig> mutant and in complemented sk <dig> carrying the 35s:spl15m cassette . primers for premature mir156b rather than mature mir <dig> sequence were used so that measurement of transcripts originating from other mir <dig> genes would be excluded. in 30-day-old plants, mir156b premature transcript levels were reduced from  <dig> -fold above wt levels in sk <dig> leaves down to a mean of 7 ±  <dig>  fold above wt in the leaves of these complemented lines, with a minimum of  <dig> -fold in line  <dig> and a maximum of  <dig> -fold in line  <dig> . thus, mir156b transcription was depressed substantially such that ~50% of the complemented lines had wt levels. a reduction of mir156b transcript level concurrent with an increase in spl15m transcripts suggests that spl <dig> may have two regulatory functions; one controlling feedback regulation of its cognate regulator mir <dig> and one controlling downstream genes, such as mir <dig>  apetala2-like  transcription factors toe <dig>  and toe <dig>  in the mir <dig> controlled gene network
 <cit> .

physical interaction between the spl <dig> dna binding domain and gcat motifs in the mir156b promoter
to investigate whether spl <dig> interacts directly with the mir156b promoter to affect transcription, we identified putative spl <dig> binding sites in the mir156b promoter based on the consensus sequence for sbp binding domain . to define the consensus sequence, we compared cis elements previously identified as sbp box interacting sequences in chlamydomonas reinhardtii <cit> , antirrhinum majus <cit>  and a. thaliana <cit>  using weblogo
 <cit> . the consensus sbp domain binding sequence was determined to be 5’-nngtacr-3’, where frequently n = c and r = a . this consensus sequence was used to search for putative spl binding sites in the promoters of mir <dig> genes. putative spl binding sites with a gtac core sequence were repeatedly present in the mir156b promoter , according to the gene transcript start site revealed by schwab
 <cit> . of these, a region containing three repeats of the core sequence appeared between - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp  suggesting that mir156b expression could be directly controlled by spl <dig>  this was tested using a his-tagged spl <dig> recombinant sbp dna-binding domain  in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a labeled dna fragment  containing a motif from - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp from the mir156b promoter. the recombinant sbp domain of spl15n specifically bound to this region of the mir156b promoter to yield a less mobile promoter fragment , and competition with 100-fold unlabeled mir156b promoter dna was required to displace the sbp domain. this result suggested that a direct physical interaction can occur between the spl <dig> dna binding domain and the mir156b promoter through the gtac motif.

discussion
enhanced expression of mir156b in sk156
in this study, we highlight a new arabidopsis mutant, sk <dig>  with enhanced expression of mir156b due to the insertion of a t-dna activation tag. the elevated mir156b transcript levels in sk <dig> are responsible for the full spectrum of morphological phenotypes observed for this mutant. increased seed carotenoid levels and enhanced branching are consistent with phenotypes observed in b. napus expressing atmir156b under the control of the camv35s promoter
 <cit> . these results confirm the role for mir156b in seed carotenoid accumulation, and are in agreement with morphological changes reported in earlier studies
 <cit> .

differences in transcriptional regulation for the native mir <dig> promoter, the camv35s promoter, and the enhanced mir156b native promoter, in addition to different t-dna insertion sites, can lead to substantial differences in transcript levels between individual transgenic lines and, consequently, to variation in phenotype. for example, mir156b transcription driven by the cavm 35s promoter was more than 2000-fold higher than native mir156b transcription in wt plants, whereas mir156b transcription in the sk <dig> mutant was ~80-fold higher than in wt plants. such differences in mir156b expression levels may result in distinct phenotypes between the sk <dig> mutant and 35s:mir156b lines. for example, numerous small rosettes and tiny leaves were produced in sk <dig> , and comparatively much smaller and many more rosette leaves were noted in the 35s:mir156b lines in this and previous studies
 <cit> .

strigolactone-independent seed carotenoid increase in sk156
our data indicated that morphological traits and seed carotenoid profiles are affected in sk <dig>  a link between altered carotenoid profiles and branching was previously observed in max mutants
 <cit>  and in an arabidopsis histone methyltransferase -defective mutant
 <cit> . this was largely due to the effect on the biosynthesis of carotenoid-derived strigolactone branching inhibitors
 <cit> . in the current study, we also demonstrated that the elevated levels of seed carotenoids in arabidopsis mutant sk <dig> were due to the enhancer-driven expression of mir156b. however, morphological phenotypes of the t <dig> progeny of sk <dig> crossed with wt  and of transgenic wt overexpressing ccd <dig> or ccd <dig>  remained almost the same as in sk <dig>  exogenous application of the artificial strigolactone gr <dig>  to sk <dig> seedlings for six weeks by supplementing the chemical to the in vitro plant growing in ms media did not affect sk <dig> phenotypes . these data suggest that ectopic expression of the mir156b-induced branching phenotype in sk <dig> might not be directly related to the strigolactone pathway. in silico analysis revealed that no known carotenoid biosynthesis or catabolism genes in arabidopsis possess sequences complimentary to the mature sequence of mir156b <cit> . as well, transcript levels of β-ring carotenoid hydroxylase, ε-ring carotene hydroxylase, lycopene β-cyclase, lycopene ε-cyclase, phytoene desaturase, phytoene synthase or ζ-carotene desaturase were not significantly different in leaves and siliques of sk <dig> and wt . thus, mir156b likely affects the seed carotenoid pathway indirectly through the regulation of spl networks as demonstrated in the mir156-regulated accumulation of anthocyanin via several spl genes
 <cit> . however, we cannot exclude the possibility of changes to seed carotenoid enzyme activities in the absence of transcription changes, such as occured with phytoene synthase in etiolated arabidopsis <cit> . also, the impact on seed carotenoid accumulation may not necessarily be due to biosynthesis, but rather to improved carotenoid sequestration and storage as demonstrated in the or mutant of brassica oleracea <cit> . these possibilities point to the need for additional investigation to unravel the biological basis for increased carotenoid accumulation in sk <dig> seeds.

in sk <dig>  a substantial increase in seed carotenoid levels was detected in all except cryptoxanthin. this minor carotenoid, however, was reduced in sk <dig> seeds. cryptoxanthin may be more efficiently converted to zeaxanthin in sk <dig> than in wt arabidopsis. this possibility could arise potentially due to differences in transcription of the related genes between wt and sk <dig> and should be tested in the future. for example, in zea mays, a β-carotene hydroxylase variant, zmbch <dig>  converts β-carotene to β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, whereas zmbch <dig> can only convert β-carotene to β-cryptoxanthin
 <cit> . also, in arabidopsis two variants of β-carotene hydroxylase were found to function differently
 <cit> .

a slight decrease in carotenoid abundance was observed in leaves of the sk <dig> line even though carotenoid levels were increased in sk <dig> seeds. transgenic b. napus in which the gene encoding lycopene ε-cyclase was constitutively down-regulated also showed increased carotenoids in seeds, but not in leaves
 <cit> . different mechanisms control carotenoid metabolism in green and non-green tissues, including seeds
 <cit> . in developing chloroplasts, the synthesis of carotenoids, such as lutein, β-carotene, zeaxanthin and violaxanthin, is regulated in concert with the light-regulated assembly of light-receiving antennae and photosystem centers into which the carotenoids are integrated
 <cit> . in contrast, carotenoid compounds in non-green tissue plastids vary widely in quantity and composition and their synthesis is not necessarily regulated similarly to chloroplasts. in seeds, carotenoids are stored in elaioplasts  or amyloplasts 
 <cit> . evaluating the impact of mir156b on the transcription of genes specifying differentiation into these carotenoid-rich plastid types could lead us to understand why mir156b regulates carotenoid accumulation differently in seeds and leaves of sk <dig> 

spl <dig> regulation of the morphology and carotenoid alterations in sk156
our 5’ race assays showed that spl <dig> mrna was cleaved at three cleavage sites in the segment located near the middle of the coding sequence and is complementary to mature mir <dig>  suggesting a role for mir156-directed cleavage in spl <dig> transcript processing. however, distinct morphologies were often difficult to find between many of the arabidopsis mutants defective in individual spl genes both in our study and in others
 <cit> . in the present study, spl <dig> mutants exhibited slightly stunted shoot growth and a modest increase in carotenoid levels, which were some  of the phenotypes of sk <dig>  while the other spl mutants examined in this study did not exhibit any discernible phenotypes. consistently, phenotypes specified by the sk <dig> mutant were largely restored to wt phenotypes in sk <dig> complemented with spl15m expressed under the control of the cavm35s promoter or the as <dig> promoter. these pieces of evidence clearly suggest that mir <dig> suppresses spl <dig> in the sk <dig> mutant and causes much of its phenotypic iteration.

other spl genes must contribute somewhat to the sk <dig> mutant phenotype development, since spl <dig> mutants did not show the entire spectrum of sk <dig> phenotypes and sk <dig> was not fully restored to a wt phenotype by spl15m expressed from a native spl <dig> promoter. these data not only indicate that spl <dig> is functionally redundant with other mir156-targeted spl genes, but that this redundancy probably is limited by the endogenous regulation of temporal and spatial gene expression. our data derived from as <dig> promoter-driven spl15m experiments show that the leaf primordium within the shoot apex is a crucial site for spl15m expression to restore sk <dig> phenotypes. this is consistent with previous findings that the shoot apex is a predominant expression site for some spl genes
 <cit>  and that as <dig> promoter-driven mir <dig> promotes leaf initiation by suppressing spl genes at the shoot apical meristem
 <cit> . as <dig> is expressed only in emerging lateral organ primordia, and in seeds its expression is detectable only in limited subepidermal cells corresponding to cotyledon initials at the heart stage
 <cit> . in our hands, as1:gus + plants did not show visible gus staining in seeds but did show staining in shoot tips, suggesting that spl15m transcript level might not be significantly elevated in as1:spl15m+ seeds compared to sk <dig>  the morphological changes in transgenic sk <dig> expressing 35s/as1:spl15m point to functional redundancy of spl <dig> with at least spl <dig> and spl <dig> on plastochron length
 <cit> , spl <dig> on shoot development
 <cit> , and spl <dig>  spl <dig>  and spl <dig> on flowering stage transition
 <cit> .

expression of mir156b-insensitive spl15m modifies leaf shape in the sk <dig> lines carrying 35s:spl15m or spl15p:spl15m constructs. a role for spl <dig> in leaf morphological traits was also revealed by usami et al
 <cit> . the enhancement of mir156b expression in sk <dig> possibly prevents the plants from maintaining sufficient spl transcript levels required for normal control of leaf architecture, including those from spl <dig>  these findings are consistent with reduced expression of  <dig> spl genes in the inflorescences of arabidopsis lines over-expressing mir156b <cit> . expression of spl <dig> gene in leaf primodia was also important for rescuing wt-like seed carotenoid and morphology traits in sk <dig>  this was supported partially by the finding that leaf primodia are a site where spl factors control the rate of leaf initiation
 <cit> .

spl <dig> feedback regulation of mir156b
feedback loops, in which a mirna-targeted transcription factor either increases or decreases the expression of its cognate mirna, have been reported in animals
 <cit> . however, the mechanism underlying this feedback regulation is unclear, particularly in plants. in our hands, complementation of sk <dig> with spl15m leads to increased levels of spl <dig> transcripts and decreased levels of mir156b transcripts. the reduction in mir156b expression due to increased spl <dig> was consistent with the inverse correlation of spl <dig> and mature mir <dig> transcripts in wt arabidopsis at the early vegetative stages 
 <cit> . these data suggest that negative feedback regulation by spl <dig> may exist for mir156b. a recent study on the regulation of mir156a and mir172b in early vegetative stages proposed feedback regulation between the mirnas and their targets but did not further investigate the underlying mechanism
 <cit> .

all spl family members contain a conserved sbp dna binding domain
 <cit>  with variations outside the domain. moreover, dna sequences in promoters of spl-regulated genes contain a gtac core
 <cit> , which is a key element for transcription regulation
 <cit> . our gel shift assay demonstrated a direct physical interaction between the spl <dig> sbp domain and the promoter region of mir156b containing three repeats of the gtac core sequence. this suggests a mechanism for the underlying feedback regulation of mir156b by its target spl <dig>  support for this finding comes from reports by birkenbihl et al
 <cit>  and yamasaki et al
 <cit>  which indicated that such an interaction also exists between the sbp domain for spl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> and the gtac element.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we showcase a new mutant, sk <dig>  in which a t-dna insert containing four camv35s enhancers hyper-induced mir156b. we documented phenotypes for several sk <dig> lines complemented with different expression cassettes for mir156b-sensitive and mir156b-insensitive spl <dig>  and showed for the first time a direct interaction between spl <dig> and mir156b. these data and the inverse pattern of mir156b and spl <dig> expression in mutant sk <dig> lead us to conclude that negative feedback regulation of mir156b by spl <dig> exists. a second finding is that mir156b regulates seed carotenoid abundance in arabidopsis differently than in leaves although the underlying molecular basis remains a subject for further investigation.
