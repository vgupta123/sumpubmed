BACKGROUND
exposure to ethanol during brain development might provoke neurodevelopmental defects that are referred to as fetal alcohol effects  or fetal alcohol syndrome   <cit> . ethanol potentially damages the developing brain by affecting neurogenesis, cell migration, or cell survival via different intracellular signaling pathways in prenatal rat cortical and hippocampal neurons  <cit> . neurodegeneration presents with reduced brain mass and neurobehavioral disturbances in many neurological disorders, and cell death processes are associated with the activation of caspase- <dig>  an executioner protease that is active during apoptotic cell death  <cit> . apoptosis is a normal process in the developing brain; for optimal development, more than 50% of the original neurons must undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis  <cit> . apoptosis is an indispensable mechanism for cellular migration and differentiation during the formation of the developing central nervous system. in particular, bax and bcl- <dig> are major apoptotic proteins and act as an apoptotic inducer and inhibitor, respectively  <cit> .

mitochondria play an important role in apoptosis under a variety of pro-apoptotic conditions, such as oxidative stress and cytochrome-c release. the latter is a key event in the activation of caspase- <dig>  a pivotal downstream step in apoptosis initiation  <cit> . research has demonstrated protective roles for vitamin e and brain derived-neurotrophic factor  against ethanol-induced apoptosis, which causes the generation of reactive oxygen species  and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential   <cit> . cellular or sustained ca2+ overload is also an important mechanism that contributes to ethanol-induced programmed cell death through the activation of post-mitochondrial events involving caspase activation  <cit> .

different therapeutic approaches have been investigated to overcome neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . some approaches consist of drugs that act directly on mitochondrial function, such as cyclosporine a, which is a permeability transition pore  reference blocker  <cit> . it was reported that the antidiabetic drug metformin  prevents ptp opening and subsequent cell death in various endothelial cell types exposed to high glucose levels  <cit> . recently, it was also reported that met can interrupt the apoptotic cascade in a model of etoposide-induced cell death by inhibiting ptp opening, blocking the release of cytochrome-c and preventing subsequent cell death  <cit> . this finding is of great clinical interest because met, beyond its anti-hyperglycemic function, can also act as a pharmacological agent in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. in this study, we showed that met is substantially neuroprotective at a therapeutic dose against ethanol-induced cell death in rat primary cortical neurons.

thymoqinone , the active component of nigella sativa  seeds, has broad and versatile pharmacological effects. these effects include strong antioxidant activity against free radical-generating agents, such as doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity  <cit> . recently, it was reported that ns extract and tq protect against cell death induced by serum/glucose deprivation in pc <dig> cells via a direct reduction in intracellular ros  <cit>  and in chronic toluene-induced neurodegeneration in the hippocampus  <cit> . recent studies reported that tq prevented brain damage in a model of transient forebrain ischemia in the rat hippocampus. tq stimulated resistance to oxidative stress by decreasing the elevated levels of malondialdehyde, glutathione  contents, catalase and superoxide dismutase   <cit> . a protective role of tq was reported in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium -treated primary dopaminergic cultures and a primary parkinson's disease model involving rotenone and neuroinflammatory mechanisms  <cit> .

previously, we reported that antioxidant vitamin c was neuroprotective against ethanol and nicotine via the modulation of gabab receptor and protein kinase a  expression in prenatal and postnatal rat brain  <cit> . thus, this study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in tq and met neuroprotection against ethanol-induced apoptosis. we investigated how met and tq regulate ca2+ dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome-c release, caspase activation and the bcl- <dig> family of proteins during ethanol-induced neuronal apoptosis.

RESULTS
effect of tq and met on ethanol-induced cell death in primary rat cortical neurons
cortical neurons were treated with ethanol , tq  and met  in different combinations for  <dig> h, and cell viability was measured by 3-- <dig>  diphenyltetrazolium bromide  assay. tq and met were co-incubated with ethanol in all experimental groups for  <dig> h. cortical neurons exposed to ethanol exhibited a decrease in cell viability after  <dig> h incubation, but cotreatment with tq at different concentrations reversed cell loss. all of the tq concentrations tested were effective, but  <dig> μm was the most efficacious . in the context of ethanol treatment, cells supplemented with tq- or met-only showed increased cell viability, while tq coadministrated with met had an even stronger effect on cell viability, which indicated a synergistic effect .

tq and met prevent ethanol-induced dysregulation of intracellular free  homeostasis
one potential mechanism of ethanol-induced neurotoxicity is through the dysregulation of cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration. cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration governs neurotransmitter release and neural development, while its dysregulation results in neuronal cell death  <cit> . abnormalities in ca2+ homeostasis, particularly overload, was linked to neural apoptosis in the present study. cytosolic free ca2+ was measured with a fluorescent ca2+ indicator, fura- <dig>  after a  <dig> h drug treatment. ethanol treatment increased cytosolic free ca2+ with peak levels at  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm compared with control having peak level  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm. tq and met cotreatment with ethanol restored normal ca2+ levels with a peak levels  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm respectively. tq and met in combination also prevented ethanol-induced ca2+ elevation with a peak level  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm . we observed that the intracellular ca2+ concentration was significantly elevated in cells exposed to ethanol  for  <dig> h compared to control, which led to neuronal cell death. tq and met reversed this effect that ethanol had on intracellular ca2+, which suggested that they have a protective role in maintaining ca2+ homeostasis.

tq and met maintain mitochondrial transmembrane potential  and prevent neuronal cell death
we examined mitochondrial membrane potential  using flow cytometry that measured the intensity of green and red fluorescence. we used a computer-based program that calculated the ratio of green to red fluorescence after  <dig> h of drug treatment. ethanol  treatment resulted in a higher ratio of green/red fl <dig> fluorescence  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  relative to control  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. lower fl <dig> fluorescence, relative to ethanol-alone group, for tq+etoh  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , met+ etoh  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  or tq+met+etoh  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  indicated that met and tq block apoptosis by preventing Δψm disruption . tq and met resulted in the appearance of a remarkable subpopulation of cells with normal Δψm, which further supported the protective effect of tq and met against ethanol. fluoro-jade-b  and propidium iodide  staining was performed to assess morphological cell death induced by ethanol. after  <dig> h, the ethanol treatment group had a greater number of dead cells; fjb and pi staining was markedly condensed with higher intensity compared to control. cotreatment with tq and met reversed the effects of ethanol .

effect of tq and met on ethanol-induced changes in bcl- <dig> and bax expression in cortical neurons
bcl- <dig> and bax are members of a family of cytoplasmic proteins that regulate apoptosis. to observe the protective effect of tq and met against ethanol-induced apoptosis, we assayed bcl- <dig> and bax expression levels by western blot analysis. western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> was enhanced by tq and met treatment but reduced by ethanol . in contrast, the pro-apoptotic bax was upregulated by ethanol but downregulated when cotreated with tq, met or tq plus met . our results showed that tq and met prevented neuronal apoptosis by decreasing the expression of pro-apoptotic bax protein while increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> protein in primary cortical neurons.

tq and met reduced the release of cytochrome-c into the cytosol and inhibited caspase- <dig> activation induced by ethanol
the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade requires the release of cytochrome-c, an intermitochondrial membrane protein, into the cytosol. this release activates caspases- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  which causes neuronal cell death  <cit> . our results revealed that ethanol exposure increased the expression cytosolic cytochrome-c levels relative to control. interestingly, tq and met supplementation reversed this trend. cells treated with ethanol along with tq or met had significantly reduced cytochrome-c expression levels relative to the ethanol treatment group . caspases are critical mediators of apoptosis in mammalian cells  <cit> . we analyzed the expression of cleaved caspase- <dig> after ethanol exposure. our results showed that ethanol significantly increased cleaved caspase- <dig> in primary cortical neurons relative to the control group, while cotreatment of ethanol with tq or met resulted in significantly lower cleaved caspase- <dig> levels compared to the ethanol treatment group .

effect of tq and met on ethanol-induced expression of caspase- <dig> and cleavage of parp- <dig> in primary rat cortical neurons
caspase- <dig> is one of the key executioners of apoptosis and is responsible, either partially or completely, for the proteolytic cleavage of many key proteins  <cit> . furthermore, the involvement of caspase- <dig> in cell death was analyzed by western blotting. ethanol induced the activation of caspase- <dig>  while tq and met effectively decreased ethanol-induced expression of caspase- <dig> in primary cortical neurons . furthermore, we determined whether the elevated levels of activated caspase- <dig> that were observed in the cortical neurons treated with ethanol led to the cleavage of parp- <dig>  which occurs during apoptosis. despite its function in dna repair, overactivation of parp- <dig> during neuronal excitotoxicity induces cell death  <cit> . the level of cleaved parp- <dig> in ethanol-treated cortical neurons was significantly enhanced compared to control neurons. in the setting of ethanol, tq and met treatment resulted in a remarkable decrease in the level of parp- <dig> and decreased its  <dig> kda cleaved products in the cortical neurons . our results collectively demonstrated that an overall increase in parp- <dig> cleavage occurred in the cortical neurons after exposure to ethanol. tq and met significantly reduced the levels of ethanol-induced cleaved parp- <dig> relative to the control groups .

effect of tq and met treatment on ethanol-induced neurodegeneration in the primary cultured cortical neurons after  <dig> h
dna damage is one of the main features of apoptosis. visualization of dna damage is accomplished with tunel staining, which is an assay for dna breaks based on enzymatic labeling of free 3' dna ends. the nuclear morphology of apoptotic neuronal cells was evaluated with tunel counterstained with dapi . ethanol exposure increased the number of tunel-positive neurons by  compared with control. tq with ethanol showed significantly reduced the tunel positive cells by  compared to the ethanol treatment group. further met with ethanol reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells by  and tq plus met with ethanol  compared to the cells treated with ethanol. although there are dapi-positive cells in control and ethanol-treated group, the pattern of staining differs between the groups. ethanol-treated cells exhibited shrunken nuclei and abnormal cell morphology .

discussion
ethanol exposure during prenatal development causes a wide range of structural and functional brain abnormalities  <cit> . it has already been established that ethanol depletes many cell populations during development, but not all populations of neurons in the brain are susceptible; furthermore, ethanol increases neuronal apoptosis, which causes malformations, including the loss of brain mass  <cit> . ethanol increases ros generation, which can trigger apoptotic cell death pathways through the activation of caspases  <cit> . the present study provides strong evidence for a direct neuroprotective role of met and tq. the current investigation indicated that cotreatment of ethanol with met, tq or met plus tq protects cortical neurons from the apoptosis triggered by ethanol during early development.

the evidence regarding neuroprotection with the antidiabetic drug met is supported by studies that state its beneficial effects in various models of toxicity. it was reported that met can protect against neurotoxicity, in addition to its antidiabetic effect, and it has a number of important, diverse functions, including in polycystic ovarian syndrome, induction of osteoblasts via amp-activated protein kinase  signaling pathway along with subsequent enhancement of nitric oxide synthase  and bone morphogenetic- <dig> protein  production  <cit> . met modulates ampk and mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathways to induce bone formation, which mimics the intracellular metabolic changes associated with nutritional deprivation  <cit> . an additional target of met is the respiratory chain complex i of the mitochondria, which activates ampk via changes in mitochondrial reactive nitrogen species  <cit> . however, we provide here a new and potential mechanism that supports a protective role of met on apoptosis that is likely due to it maintaining mitochondria integrity and reducing c overload as well as subsequent cell death  <cit> .

furthermore, we studied tq, which is a natural compound with different beneficial pharmacologic effects against various cytotoxic insults. these beneficial effects have been observed in vitro and in vivo with degeneration caused by l-dopa in sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells, serum/glucose deprivation induced cell death  and chronic toluene exposure  <cit> . in general, previously published reports showed that tq mainly functions through its antioxidant mechanism, and it has been used as a protective agent in multiple toxicity models, such as doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and ischemic neuronal cell death  <cit> .

we found that administration of met and tq in selected doses has the capability to maintain normal cell viability against ethanol. tq, met or a combination of both reduced the cell death induced by ethanol . calcium homeostasis is an important for normal cellular physiological function, and even a minute variation in normal levels can provoke abnormal cellular function and cell death  <cit> . this c overload further disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential , which leads to neuronal apoptosis. in this study, we observed a two-fold increase in c levels upon ethanol treatment compared to control cells. this cellular accumulation of calcium possibly induced cell death. previously, a similar increase in intracellular c was observed after a short  exposure to ethanol in prenatal primary neuronal cells  <cit> , fetal hypothalamic cells and cervical ganglion neurons  <cit> . tq and met reduced elevated c levels . tq and met modulate and stabilize Δψm. our findings that showed ethanol-induced alterations in mitochondrial function were also in agreement with a recent study that demonstrated that vitamin e and bdnf have neuroprotective and modulating roles during ethanol toxicity in cerebellar granule cells. the mechanism of neuroprotection was similar to met and tq involved the stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibition of apoptotic cascade  <cit> .

the bcl- <dig> protein family plays an important role in apoptotic signal transduction by regulating mitochondrial function  <cit> . it was reported that mitochondrial cytochrome-c is released into the cytosol through the permeability transition pore, which is regulated by bcl- <dig> family proteins  <cit> . the pro-apoptotic protein bax destabilizes Δψm and facilitates cytochrome-c release  <cit> , while the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig> functions to restore membrane potential and block cytochrome-c release. in our findings, we found that tq and met increased bcl- <dig> levels in primary cortical neurons exposed to ethanol. tunel and western blot analysis demonstrated that tq and met cotreatment protects neurons by lowering the expression of caspase- <dig>  cytochrome-c, cleaved caspase- <dig> while also increasing the expression of bcl- <dig> compared to cells treated with ethanol alone. this finding implied that tq and met potentially prevents apoptosis by regulating the mitochondrial path way.

parp- <dig> functions in apoptosis by acting as a survival factor and a death promoter, depending on the duration and severity of dna damage  <cit> . we observed cleavage of parp- <dig> to its respective  <dig> kda fragment after a  <dig> h exposure to ethanol. in met and tq treatment groups, fragmentation of parp- <dig> was significantly reduced. in support of our results, other investigators noted caspase-dependent cleavage of parp- <dig> that was induced by an ethanol concentration , similar to the one used in this study, for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h time periods  <cit> . the potential benefit of met and tq on primary neuronal cell viability was evaluated by tunel assay. met and tq decreased dna damage and reduced the number of tunel-positive cells produced by ethanol treatment. a study using an analogous experimental approach demonstrated similar dna damage induced by ethanol in cultured cortical neurons  <cit> .

the present findings supported a conclusion that ethanol disrupts Δψm, sustains ca2+ overload and triggers an apoptotic cascade. met and tq inhibition of ethanol-induced cell death in primary rat cortical neurons might occur via an antioxidant mechanism that maintains mitochondrial integrity. since met and tq are safe and nontoxic, more studies should be conducted to explain their synergistic actions with other drugs.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study demonstrated that tq and met exert a neuroprotective effect by decreasing ethanol-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. although additional studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying tq and met actions, tq and met are readily available and safe agents, so they could eventually be used as neuroprotectants against ethanol-induced neurodegeneration during early development.
