BACKGROUND
genetic materials of eukaryotic organisms are packaged into chromatin inside cell nucleus. this compact structure has the form like a bead-on-string fiber containing fundamental repeating units, the nucleosomes. each nucleosome is composed of  <dig> bp of dna wrapped  <dig>  turns around an octamer of histone proteins consisting of a central  <dig> tetramer flanked on both side by two h2a - h2b dimers  <cit> . since it was first recognized  <cit> , there have been increasing evidences showing that chromatin plays a much more important role far beyond dna compaction. by burying cis-regulatory elements under histone proteins and/or modifying related epigenetic information, chromatin imposes ubiquitous and profound effects on many dna-based processes, including transcription, dna repair and replication. to ensure faithfully copy both genetic and epigenetic information during replication or to facilitate the binding of transcription factors  to regulatory elements during transcription in the context of chromatin, cells have developed complicated biological pathways  <cit> . in these pathways, by regulating nucleosome stability cells can control the accessibility of underlying dna sequences to biological machineries. for example, in replication, during the process known as parental histone segregation, pre-existing nucleosomes located ahead of replication forks are transiently disrupted from parental dna strands and later transferred onto nascent dna  <cit> . in transcription, moving nucleosomes to different translational positions is known as one way to change the accessibility of nucleosomal dna to tfs  <cit> . also, promoter regions of actively transcribed genes are usually free of nucleosomes  <cit> . so, understanding how cells regulate nucleosome stability will bring us additional insights into mechanisms of many important biological processes.

nucleosome stability can be regulated by many factors, such as dna sequences, histone modifications and histone variants, and chromatin remodelling complexes  <cit> . for example, dna sequence is known as a reliable determinant for nucleosome preference, which can be used to predict nearly 50% of nucleosome positions  <cit> , so it is likely to be an important factor in favouring or disfavouring nucleosome eviction. histone variant h2a.z  is found to be preferentially enriched at promoters where some nucleosomes have to be quickly removed upon transcriptional activation  <cit> . also, acetylated histones are shown to be easily dissociated from dna  <cit> . chromatin remodelling complexes, such as swi/snf, act in concert with histone chaperones  to displace histones from their original positions  <cit> . although the complete list of factors has been fairly known, the mechanisms of how they act to mobilize nucleosome are still unclear.

owing to recent advanced profiling techniques, such as chip-on-chip and chip-seq, we now have increasing amount of information about how nucleosomes and various kinds of histone modifications are distributed over the genomes of many organisms, including yeast, drosophila, and human  <cit> . this opens up a chance for thorough investigation of nucleosome organization, its regulatory mechanisms and functions. until now, there have been many works, both experimental and computational, concentrating on revealing the effects of factors stated above on nuclesome distribution  <cit>  but most of them have some common drawbacks. first, they mainly considered the effect of each factor separately while bypassing their combinatorial effects on nucleosome distribution. second, although the distribution of destabilized nucleosomes is usually inhomogeneous throughout the genome and is known to have strong relation with transcriptional activities  <cit> , it is still not well-characterized compared with that of stable nucleosomes.

there are several efforts trying to overcome these limitations. for example, rippe et al.  <cit>  and schnitzler  <cit>  investigated co-effects of dna sequences and chromatin remodelling complexes; widlund et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit>  investigated co-effects of histone tails and dna sequences on nucleosome distribution. most of them, however, were based on experimental methods. more recently, dai et al.  <cit>  used both transcriptional interaction and genomic sequence information to computationally identify dynamic nucleosome distribution, but the number of works like this is still limit.

enthused by these facts, in this paper, we propose a novel method for computationally characterizing nucleosome dynamics from both genomic sequences and histone modification profiles. our method is based on induction rule learning adapted for subgroup discovery, which can discover sufficiently large and statistically meaningful subsets of population as shown in  <cit> , so it is well suited for characterizing inhomogeneous distribution of destabilized nucleosomes. moreover, by combining both genetic sequence and histone modification information, our method can discover the combinatorial nature of these two factors in regulating nucleosome stability. our results on s. cerevisiae show that, some dna motifs, which are reliable determinants for nucleosome forming/inhibiting potential, and post-translational modifications of histone proteins, which have strong relation with transcriptional activities, are likely to be more significant to nucleosome dynamics. we also found some patterns of cooperation between these dna motifs and histone modifications in regulating nucleosome stability. our results give additional insights into mechanisms of how cells regulate important biological processes, such as transcription, dna repair and replication.

RESULTS
potentially significant motifs to nucleosome dynamics
dna sequence has long been known to be a strong determinant for nucleosome formation potential, which can be used to identify nearly 50% of positioned nucleosomes in vivo, so it is likey to be an important factor affecting nuclesome stability. to determine dna motifs which may be importantly related to nucleosome stability, two different approaches were applied . in the first one, we used wordspy  <cit>  with the word length set to  <dig> to identify statistically significant motifs related to nucleosome states. the length of  <dig> was chosen because, as shown in some previous research  <cit> , nucleosome forming ability of dna sequences may be decided mostly by short motifs, with length from  <dig> to  <dig>  wordspy uses dictionary-based approach so it is suitable to find short motifs among a group of dna sequences  <cit> . tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the  <dig> most significant motifs related to  <dig> states of nucleosomes found by wordspy when run on chromosome iii and promoter region data, respectively . the results show no big difference between important motifs of genetic regions and those of promoter regions. for example, both of them are enriched of dinucleotides tg/ca and this coincides with previous research  <cit> , showing that tg/ca are highly flexible dinucleotides so they have large impact in imparting nucleosome forming ability. from the results given by wordspy, it is difficult to identify motifs that may be important in discriminating nucleosome states. so, we used the second approach based on feature selection with fisher criterion  to overcome this limitation. table  <dig> shows  <dig> strongest discriminative motifs corresponding to chromosome iii and promoter regions ranked by their f-score values . among them, dinucleotides are likely the most important motifs compared with the others in deciding nucleosome stability:  <dig> and  <dig> over  <dig> in chromosome iii and promoter sequences, respectively. moreover, among  <dig> strongest discriminative signals are aa/tt/at/ta/ca/tg  and at/tt/ca/tg , which are related with nucleosome forming  and inhibiting  potential of dna sequences.

significant histone modifications to nucleosome dynamics
histone modification is one of the most important non-sequence regulatory factors of many chromatin-based processes and has also been known to affect nucleosome stability. to identify histone modifications potentially significant to nucleosome stability, we applied feature selection procedure, the same as what was done with dna sequences, on the data of  <dig> different histone modifications corresponding to chromosome iii and promoter regions . the result was ranked by f-score and given in table  <dig>  this result shows that, the first  <dig> modifications of chromosome iii, including h3k14ac/h4k5ac/h3k4me3/h4k12ac/h3k4me1/h3k9ac/h2ak7ac/h4k16ac/h2bk16ac, and the first  <dig> ones of promoter regions, including h3k4me3/h3k9ac/h3k18ac/h4k16ac/h4k12ac/h4k8ac, seem to be more important to nucleosome stability. notably, all significant modifications in promoter regions are strongly related to transcriptional activation  and repression   <cit> . that is also true with some significant modifications in chromosome iii, where h3k4me3/h3k9ac and h4k12ac/h4k16ac/h2bk16ac are known to have strong relation with transcriptional activation and repression, correspondingly.

effects of dna sequences and histone modifications on nucleosome dynamics
in order to see how dna sequences and histone modifications affect nucleosome stability, we applied our method to the data containing significant dna motifs and histone modifications identified above . after filtering out uninteresting rules , we received two sets of  <dig> rules  and  <dig> rules  characterizing nucleosome dynamics on chromosome iii and promoter regions, correspondingly. table  <dig> shows some selected rules from these rule sets. analyzing these rules, we discovered that the enrichness of some specific dna motifs has special impact on nucleosome stability. for example, nucleosomes bound by sequences enriched with at/att/ctt are more stable . this agrees with the result from  <cit> , which said that sequences enriched with dinucleotides at/tt have potential to inhibit nucleosome forming and deforming them on nucleosomes is more costly, so nucleosomes bound by these sequences may be more stable. also, h3k9ac/h3k18ac/h3k4me <dig> are known to have positive relation with transcriptional activation  <cit> , so nucleosomes which are hyper-acetylated at h3k9/h3k <dig> and hyper-trimethylated at h3k <dig> seem to be more dynamic . in contrast, h4k12ac is known to have positive relation with transcriptional repression  <cit> , so h4k <dig> hyper-acetylated nucleosomes are more stable  while h4k <dig> hypo-acetylated nucleosomes are more dynamic . however, there is no dna pattern or post-translational modification showing dominant effect on nucleosome stability. instead, there exist combinatorial effects, by dna motifs themselves  or by both dna motifs and histone modifications , on nucleosome stability. for example, if h3k4me <dig> or h3k9ac nucleosomes are located in regions enriched with att tri-nucleotide, they will become more stable ; and even being located in regions enriched with at dinucleotide, h4k <dig> hypo-acetylated nucleosomes still have potential of becoming unstable . this agrees with the results from previous and recent works showing that the effects of histone acetylations depend on which lysines are acetylated and the locations of modified nuclesomes  <cit> ; and nucleosome positioning effect of dna sequences is decided by the combination of nucleosome favouring and disfavouring motifs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
nucleosome dynamics plays important roles in many dna-based processes and is regulated by many factors, such as dna sequences, post-translational modifications of histone proteins, and chromatin remodelling complexes. however, most of the previous works only investigated the effect of individual factor while bypassing their combinatorial effects on the distribution of stable nucleosomes. in this paper, we proposed a novel method based on induction rule learning to computationally characterize nucleosome dynamics from both genomic and histone modification information. our method is shown to be suitable for characterizing inhomogeneous distributions like that of destabilized nucleosomes; and by combining both genomic and histone modification information, it can discover potential co-effects of these two factors on nucleosome dynamics.

our results on s. cerevisiae show that, some dna motifs and histone modifications are more important in stabilizing and destabilizing nucleosomes. these dna motifs and histone modifications are known to have strong relations with nucleosome forming/inhibiting potential and transcriptional activities, correspondingly. they not only act individually but also cooperate with each other by some specific patterns to combinatorially affect nucleosome stability.

although our method is efficient in characterizing nucleosome dynamics, it produces a larger number of rules, of which many may be irrelevant. in the future, we need to develop a better method for filtering these uninteresting rules.
