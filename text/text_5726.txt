BACKGROUND
during the past decades, meat poultry breeding has been predominantly focused on accelerating growth rate and yields of breast and thigh meat. the impressive progress made in these traits, however, has been accompanied by deterioration of taste quality of the broiler meat and, in some markets, decreased acceptability of the meat by consumers  <cit> .

intramuscular fat , located in most species in the epimysium, perimysium and endomysium, is an important determinant of meat quality. a certain amount of imf can enhance meat quality traits such as the flavor, juiciness, water holding capacity and tenderness  <cit> . additionally, imf can improve meat quality by reducing the drip loss and cooking loss  <cit> .

compared to beef, chicken meat does not present a marbled aspect and intramuscular fat is not visible and not anatomically separable; a higher proportion of imf is represented by polar lipids, presumably within membranes. previous studies found that the imf content of chicken meat increased with age from d  <dig> to d  <dig>  <cit>  and may increase further after that , along with flavor and taste of the meat  <cit> .

for livestock imf, studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying imf deposition have revealed large numbers of degs and signaling pathways including adamst4-signaling and insulin-signaling pathways  <cit> . compared to mammals, where most de novo synthesis of fatty acids occurs in adipose tissue  <cit> , chicken differs in lipid metabolism because little fatty acid synthesis occurs in adipose tissues in this species  <cit> . until now, no systematic studies have been reported on the imf development in chicken at the molecular level, although expression profiles in abdominal fat tissue  <cit> , liver  <cit>  or muscle cells  <cit>  have been performed. this study provides a comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles of chicken breast using both fast- and slow-growing breeds.

RESULTS
differentially expressed gene profiles in breasts of slow- and fast-growing chickens
to identify potential candidate genes affecting chicken imf deposition, gene expression profiles in breast muscle of both beijing-you  and arbor acres  chickens at different developmental stages were examined using agilent cdna microarray technology. divergence of breast growth rates in bjy and aa chickens are shown in table  <dig>  of the target traits measured, imf contents and muscle weights at later ages  were all higher than the content and weight at d  <dig> . thus, for each breed, the gene expression profile at d  <dig> was used as the control and the degs analyses were carried out as comparisons with d  <dig> . for aa chickens,  <dig> genes  were detected as degs with consistent fold changes ≥ <dig> , in all comparisons. in bjy chickens,  <dig> genes  were detected as degs . there were  <dig> de genes  shared by the two breeds, .

based on the known de genes, go analysis was performed in each breed, and the enriched go-terms  in the ontology classification “biological process” were selected and are presented in additional file  <dig>  the results showed the consistency of enriched go-terms between the two breeds, mainly including the following processes: muscle system, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, protein metabolism, hormone metabolism, trans-membrane transport, oxidation-reduction, regulation of cell differentiation, regulation of immune system, blood circulation, regulation of apoptosis and atp biosynthesis.

to validate the microarrays, normal distribution analysis was performed with the results of the nine microarrays, and all of their coefficients were < <dig> . based on the  <dig> known genes that were shared as degs in both breeds, cluster analysis of all microarrays was performed  using the cluster  <dig>  software. the results demonstrated that expression profiles of samples at different ages of the same breed were polymerized together; the expression patterns of genes at d  <dig> differed more than those at other ages.

to further validate the results of microarray testing, q-pcr was used to examine the relative expression of  <dig> de key genes selected in each breed at different ages. the results showed acceptable consistency between the results of q-pcr and the fold-change of de genes in the microarrays .

key genes related to lipid metabolism and muscle development
as imf is located throughout skeletal muscle, and not as discrete adipose deposits in chicken, it is reasonable to assume that degs related to muscle development or lipid metabolism in current study would contribute to its process of deposition. the go-term analysis showed that known de genes related to muscle development  and genes related to lipid metabolism  were found . the  <dig> de genes related to muscle development that were shared by the two breeds included fgf <dig>  myh <dig>  mybpc <dig>  myh7b, myl <dig>  myl <dig>  myl <dig>  myo15a, tgfa and wnt <dig> ; these might be key genes. the  <dig> degs affecting lipid metabolism that were shared by bjy and aa breeds included acsl <dig>  acss <dig>  apoh, fabp <dig>  fabp <dig>  cetp, rxra, ppargc1a, snx <dig> and snx <dig> .

genes for which the expression was significantly correlated with changes in muscle development and lipid deposition were analyzed as these genes might be directly involved in imf regulation. the changes in muscle weight, the content of imf, triglyceride  and phospholipids  in breast tissue of the two breeds at different ages are provided in table  <dig>  the striking difference between the breeds in the rate of growth of the breast muscle is apparent but growth continues across all ages sampled.

based on the trait measurements, relationships between expression of degs and muscle development and lipid deposition  were examined. the expression of gdf <dig> and capns <dig> in aa, and ankrd <dig> and plg in bjy were positively correlated  with muscle development. the expression of bmp2k and mybpc <dig> in aa, and cenpf, eln, fgf <dig>  fgfr <dig>  mybl <dig>  mycn and mybpc <dig> in bjy were negatively correlated  with that of muscle development . for lipid deposition, ch25h, rcjmb04_10b <dig>  rcjmb04_13o <dig>  snx <dig>  and cetp in aa, and ywhah, nr3c <dig> and cetp in bjy were positively correlated  with plip contents while naca, rbp <dig> and gltpd <dig> in aa chickens, and loc <dig>  etfdh and gltpd <dig> in bjy chickens were negatively correlated  with plip contents. in the case of tg deposition, hmgcll <dig>  thbs <dig>  ucp <dig> and snx <dig> in aa, and ehhadh and snx <dig> in bjy were positively correlated  with tg contents and sgpl <dig>  sh3pxd2b and thrsp in just the aa chickens were negatively correlated  with contents of tg or imf . the expression of  <dig> deg , common to both breeds, was positively correlated with breast tissue weight across ages while  <dig> degs , common to the two breeds, were positively or negatively correlated with imf, tg or plip contents .

all correlations were significant . 1key gene were defined as its expression determined by microarray was significantly correlated  with changes in breast muscle weight or in content of imf, tg or pltp across the sampled ages. 2common to both bjy and aa breeds, the expression of genes was significantly correlated with target traits across ages. “+” represents up-regulated effect; “-” represents down-regulated effect. d = day. imf, intramuscular fat; tg, triglyceride; plip, phospholipids; bjy, beijing-you; aa, arbor acres.

the relative abundances of mybpc <dig>  gltpd <dig>  cetp, snx <dig> transcripts in bjy chickens and in aa chickens were further measured by q-pcr. consistent correlation between mrna expression of these genes and muscle development and lipid deposition  were found and are shown in figure  <dig> 

pathways and a regulatory network for imf content in chickens
the regulation of imf is possibly a function of complex pathway interactions involving muscle, fat and connective tissue  <cit> , so examining regulatory networks is the preferred method of analysis. after kegg pathway analysis of the known degs related to muscle development and lipid metabolism,  <dig> metabolic pathways were identified in each breed, with  <dig> being shared by bjy and aa chickens . well known pathways affecting lipid metabolism  were enriched in both breeds; the erbb signaling pathway probably plays a role upstream of mapk signaling. these analyses also demonstrate that pathways related to cell junctions  were also enriched and might form a network with pathways related to lipid metabolism to influence the deposition of imf .

discussion
cdna array analysis
fat deposition in chickens takes place mainly in visceral adipose tissue and in muscle. the latter, imf, is very important for sensory aspects of meat quality and there is increasing interest in improving quality, perhaps using marker-assisted selection for imf. although global gene expression surveys have been performed on visceral tissues  <cit> , this study is the first to systematically explore gene expression profiles in breast tissue using two distinct breeds across their development. the present objective was to identify global genes and pathways affecting chicken imf deposition.

chicken microarrays were employed, each using pooled rna samples . such a pooling strategy can dramatically improve accuracy when only one array is available in each biological condition  <cit> . potential candidate degs related to imf deposition were rigorously defined, requiring their expression to differ across all comparisons conducted . to confirm results from the microarrays, more than  <dig> tests were done with q-pcr, involving 12– <dig> genes in breast tissue at  <dig> or  <dig> sampled ages in each breed. as shown in figure  <dig>  fold-changes in gene expression between the two methods were correlated in both bjy  and aa  chickens.

function of key degs affecting imf and muscle development
the data obtained here indicate that three key genes related to lipid metabolism were shared by the two breeds  and showed consistent trends with the changes in imf, tg or plip contents across the ages examined . cholesteryl ester transfer protein  functions in the reversible transport/exchange of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins  and triglycerides from very-low-density  or low-density  lipoproteins. the snx <dig> gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family which associates with a variety of receptors, including those for insulin, egf and leptin  <cit> . glycolipid transfer protein d <dig>  is a cytosolic protein that transfers glycolipids between different intracellular membranes  <cit> ; its precise biological function is not known.

for key candidate genes affecting muscle development, one gene common to the two breeds  changed consistently with the changing patterns of breast tissue weight . the mybpc <dig> gene encodes a slow form of mybp c found in skeletal muscle and functions in the assembly and stabilization of sarcomeric m- and a-bands and regulates the contractile properties of actomyosin filaments. in chickens, increased levels of mybp-c slow are found in dystrophic skeletal muscles  <cit> . further research is required to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to the anticipated effects of this candidate gene on lipid metabolism and muscle development in chickens.

function of novel pathways related to imf
go-term analysis was used to explore the function of degs and kegg pathway analysis was used to explore the regulatory network underlying chicken imf deposition. as expected, several well-known pathways related to lipid metabolism were found, including the mapk and ppar signaling pathways  <cit> . large numbers of degs involved in ppar signaling pathways here have been proven to be functional in lipid metabolism, such as fabp family genes , acsl <dig>  cd <dig>  pltp <cit> . this is partially consistent with our previous studies where mrna expression of adipocyte fabp and heart-type fabp genes and snp markers from these genes were found to be associated with imf content in chinese chickens  <cit> . several degs  belonging to the fgf family and receptors were reflected in the mapk signaling pathway.

of special interest, these go and kegg analyses provide the first demonstration that a series of pathways related to cell junctions might contribute to the deposition of imf. degs related to muscle development included well-known genes  related to the biosynthesis of myosin, of which myl <dig> and myl <dig> encode proteins involved in the formation of tight junctions, focal adhesions and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. additionally, the ctnnb <dig> gene encodes β-catenin, one of the proteins constituting adherens junctions, and anchoring the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> ; actb encodes beta-actin, one of the non-muscle cytoskeletal actins playing a central role in shape determination, cytokinesis, and cell motility, along with cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions  <cit> . in addition, degs of the fgf family and their receptors  were reflected in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and may modulate morphogenetic processes involving cellular rearrangements and tissue remodeling  <cit> . the genes thbs <dig> and cd <dig> are involved in extracellular matrix -receptor interaction  <cit>  and influence, directly or indirectly, cellular activities such as adhesion and migration. in support of this, previous studies have shown that changes in cytoskeletal organization and its contacts with the ecm are essential in the morphogenesis of fibroblastic preadipocytes to rounded, mature adipocytes  <cit> , while the expression of actin, integrins and several cytoskeletal proteins is down-regulated during adipogenesis  <cit> . taken together, cell junctions including the interaction of the ecm and cytoskeleton might participate in accumulation of imf during chicken development.

the kegg analysis implicated the mapk signaling pathway in processes involving tight junctions, focal adhesion and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. this is also consistent with studies showing that activation of mapk activity resulted in the disruption of tight junctions, and that inhibition of mapk activation prevented this process  <cit> . we suggest that processes related to cell junctions might interact with pathways related to lipid metabolism, mainly through mapk activity, to influence the deposition of imf. the proposed molecular regulatory network affecting imf deposition during chicken development is presented in figure  <dig>  this novel suggestion of imf regulation and its detailed mechanism through pathways related to cell junctions in addition to lipid metabolism needs further examination.

the present approach has used gene expression profiling to elucidate molecular mechanisms of post-hatch imf deposition in chickens. possible regulation by translational mechanisms and posttranslational modifications may also contribute. a more complete understanding of imf development in chickens should include further examination of the expression and function of the proteins encoded by the genes identified here in both embryonic and post-hatch stages of development.

CONCLUSIONS
with aim of identifing global candidate genes and new pathways related to imf deposition in chicken breast, agilent cdna microarray analyses were performed with both fast- and slow- growing breeds. gene expression profiles of breast muscle sampled at different developmental stages of bjy and aa chickens were determined. relative to d  <dig>  breast muscle at d  <dig>  d  <dig>  d  <dig> and d  <dig>  contained  <dig> degs in bjy and  <dig> degs in aa. several degs  may play key roles in imf developmental processes because their expressions were correlated with the changing patterns of lipid content or breast weight across the ages sampled in both two breeds. in addition, the results of kegg pathway analysis imply that imf deposition in chickens is regulated and mediated not only by genes and pathways related to lipid metabolism and muscle development, but also by others involved in cell junctions with the function in maintaining the integrity of tissues and signal transduction. these findings establish the groundwork and provide new clues for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying imf deposition in poultry. additional studies of translational and posttranslational effects will be required to complement these mrna expression analyses.
