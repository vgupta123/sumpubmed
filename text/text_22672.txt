BACKGROUND
in the majority of industrial fermentation applications of bakers' yeast , a high initial and sustained capacity to ferment the available sugar is a highly important characteristic, especially when the biomass is introduced in an application environment with high sugar concentrations and/or absence of oxygen. despite several attempts  <cit> , quantitative data concerning the dynamics of the adaptation to such industrially relevant fermentative conditions have not been obtained. the majority of studies published to date on fermentative capacity under defined conditions rely on the use of batch or chemostat cultures  <cit> . the high specific growth rate in batch cultures does not reflect typical industrial conditions for aerobic cultivation of yeast biomass and has a drastic impact on fermentative capacity  <cit> . in chemostat cultures, which can be used in physiological studies to specifically investigate the effect of individual culture parameters, several physiological and transcriptional responses to the availability of oxygen and/or glucose have been identified  <cit> . however, in steady state chemostats dynamic responses to change in culture parameters can not be observed. a perturbation of one parameter in a chemostat cultivation results in a reproducible dynamic response from a defined constant culture  <cit> . by means of such experimental set-up, short and long term dynamics have been studied to pulses of low glucose concentrations  <cit> .

the goal of the present study was to investigate the dynamic adaptation of s. cerevisiae to the industrially relevant transition from aerobic, sugar-limited and respiratory growth to fully fermentative  conditions and to dissect responses to the glucose up-shift and onset of anaerobicity. to this end, aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a moderate specific growth rate  were exposed to two simultaneous perturbations: a rapid depletion of oxygen and an increase of glucose concentration to a high value . physiological analysis confirmed that the chemostat culture was fully respiratory before, and fully fermentative after the shift. global dynamic responses to this combined perturbation were analyzed through genome-wide transcription analysis.

RESULTS
physiological characterization
to invoke rapid and full induction of fermentative capacity, respiratory, aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures  were shifted to fully fermentative conditions by sudden depletion of oxygen and addition of glucose. the glucose was added two min after sparging the continuous culture with pure nitrogen, when the dissolved oxygen concentration had decreased from 75–80% to 10–15% of air saturation . this raised the glucose concentration to  <dig> mm and ensured that the residual glucose concentration after  <dig> h of cultivation would still be above  <dig> mm, thus maintaining strong glucose catabolite repression throughout the experiment.   <cit> . indeed, the sudden shift to fermentative conditions resulted in fully fermentative metabolism within the first  <dig> min with co <dig>  ethanol and glycerol as the major metabolic products . this metabolic shift coincided with an increasing specific glucose consumption rate, up to 12-fold, over  <dig> h following the perturbation . the specific ethanol production rate, which under these anaerobic glucose-excess conditions reflects the culture's fermentative capacity, steadily increased to  <dig>  mmol ethanol·g-1·h- <dig> . while the overall metabolic response was rapid and strong, the biomass concentration, the cell count and the cellular protein content did not change significantly throughout the experiment . during the two hours of the experiment, the growth rate did not exceed the starting growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  the biomass therefore only contributed to 5% of the total carbon flux, while the main metabolic products  accounted for ca. 90% of the total carbon produced.

microarray data processing and general transcriptional response
to identify genome-wide transcriptional changes connected to the induced metabolic adaptation, micro-array analysis was performed on samples from two independent replicate steady-state chemostat cultures and on samples taken  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min after glucose addition. the coefficient of variation between replicates was below 20%, which is comparable with previous chemostat-based transcriptome analyses  <cit> .

a first main concern was with normalization of these microarray data from non-steady-state culture samples. in previous transcriptome studies on steady-state chemostat cultures using affymetrix microarrays, setting the average signal intensity of all probe-sets to a fixed value  provided a good normalization method  <cit> . as this normalization method might not be appropriate for dynamic cultivation conditions, we considered transcript levels of a few so-called 'house-keeping' genes commonly used as loading standards for northern analysis and quantitative rt-pcr. after global scaling, the expression of act <dig>  hht <dig> and shr <dig>  remained constant throughout the experiment with a variation coefficient around or below 20%. the stable transcript levels of house-keeping gene expression obtained with a global scaling approach indicated that no major changes in the total mrna pools occurred during the experiment, which would require another type of normalization.

after global scaling, the significance of the changes in transcript levels during the dynamic experiment was estimated using the edge software . a set of  <dig> genes was thus identified as being transcriptionally regulated in response to combined oxygen depletion and glucose addition . this large group of genes was divided in several subgroups according to their expression profiles.  <dig> genes whose transcript levels increased after the perturbation were separated into four clusters according to their initial and later response .  <dig> genes with reduced transcripts responded rapidly to the perturbations  and were clustered according to their secondary response . all clusters were subsequently searched for overrepresentation of specific functional categories , and of promoter elements corresponding to specific transcriptional regulation networks . upon a first inspection, some of clusters, despite subtle differences in their time-dependent transcript profiles, showed an overrepresentation of genes from the same functional categories. these were pooled to further improve the enrichment analysis. thus cluster a and b, as well as  <dig> and  <dig>  and also  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were pooled , resulting in a final set of six different clusters.

a: amount of genes in the genome belonging to the specified functional category

b: amount of genes in the respective clusters or group of clusters belonging to the specified functional category

a: presence of the transcription factor in one of the clusters; nc = transcription factor not significant changed over time

b: amount of genes in the genome belonging to the specified transcription factor

c: amount of genes in the respective clusters or group of clusters belonging to the specified transcription factor

d: enrichment represented by a p-value for the in-house analysis or a coverage coefficient  for the analysis with rsat tool

initial response
sudden relief from glucose limitation enables yeast cells to accelerate to a higher specific growth rate. although faster growth was not observed in the  <dig> h after the relief of glucose limitation, over one third of the initially up-regulated genes were related to protein synthesis . this included a massive and fast up-regulation of genes within clusters a and b that encode components of the translational machinery, including  <dig> genes involved in rrna synthesis, processing and modification and  <dig> genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis . taking into account that the total rna pool mainly consists of rrna  <cit> , an up-regulation of rrna synthesis was confirmed by an increase of the rna content of the biomass after the relief from glucose limitation .

genes in cluster c displayed a sustained, slower increase of their transcript levels than those in clusters a and b. 37% of the genes in cluster c encoded ribosomal proteins. the delay between the expression of ribosomal biogenesis/rrna genes and ribosomal protein genes is in line with previous observations indicating the existence of different regulatory mechanisms for these two groups of genes  <cit> . accordingly, pac and rrpe regulatory elements were enriched in the promoter regions of genes in clusters a & b, whereas rap1p/sfp1p and fhl1p motifs were overrepresented in the promoter regions of cluster c genes . in addition to the translational machinery,  <dig> genes involved in amino acid metabolism and  <dig> genes involved in nucleotide metabolism were up-regulated. this was consistent with the overrepresentation of met32p  <cit> , gcn4p  <cit>  and bas1p  <cit>  binding sites in the promoter regions of these genes, and indicated the need for synthesis of building blocks for transcription and translation.

among the  <dig> genes with reduced expression, one cluster comprising  <dig> genes showed rapid and strong repression . although this cluster appeared relatively heterogeneous, one functional category was clearly enriched. it consists of seven transcription factor genes  involved in various cellular functions, like fatty acid oxidation, stress response and cell cycle progression  <cit> . a large number of known targets of these transcription factors were also present in the down-regulated clusters . most of the remaining  <dig> down-regulated genes were associated to metabolism and energy generation. in addition, a large number of genes involved in protein degradation  were down-regulated, indicating a decreased requirement for proteolytic activity. interestingly,  <dig> genes involved in stress response were down-regulated, including  <dig> related to oxidative stress response. this observation suggests that anaerobicity per se does not evoke an immediate stress for yeast.

secondary response
as expected, the initial response to fully fermentative conditions showed quite some overlap with published datasets for glucose pulses to aerobic cultures  <cit> , including induction of the translational machinery and repression of the respiratory chain  <cit> . with this study, we aimed to go beyond the primary response to see how yeast adjusted to its altered growth environment.

we did not identify genes whose transcript levels continuously increased or decreased in the  <dig> h following the perturbation. at  <dig> min after the shift, a pivotal point appeared to be reached at which the transcript profiles either indicated a reverse regulation mode  or a stable mrna level . in this respect, a striking difference was observed between the transcript profiles of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and those encoding ribosomal biogenesis components . a steady transcript level after  <dig> min of ribosomal proteins was indicative for a constitutive requirement for translational building blocks to support faster growth. in contrast, transcriptional up-regulated genes involved in the synthesis, processing and modification of the translational machinery appeared only to be temporarily required for a rapid adaptation to the new environmental conditions. in addition to the ribosomal protein genes, genes involved in de novo purine biosynthesis, methionine metabolism, and tetrahydrofolate-dependent c <dig> metabolism were continuously transcribed at an elevated level after  <dig> min. all three functional categories have previously been correlated with each other, and with a response to the decrease in the adenine nucleotide pool  <cit> .

also the initially down-regulated genes with a turning point after  <dig> min could be divided in two groups: steady pattern after  <dig> min  or again up-regulated after  <dig> min . during the course of the experiment, the glucose concentration remained high and hence, functional categories known to be repressed by glucose were enriched among the clusters in which the transcript level remained low after  <dig> min. regulatory factors involved in regulation of the respiratory chain  were down-regulated together with their targets  <cit> . stress-response genes also maintained low transcript level during the experiment. in contrast, transcripts of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, reserve carbohydrate metabolism and protein degradation tended to increase again after  <dig> min. the large and coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of the translational machinery, specifically ribosomal proteins, complemented an opposite transcriptional regulation pattern of genes related to proteolytic activity. the down-regulation of target genes of the mbp1/swi <dig> complex, involved in g <dig> to s transition  <cit> , correlated with a delay in cell cycle progression and correspondingly, a constant cell number over the two h monitored.

many genes involved in the metabolism of storage carbohydrates  showed a decreased transcript level after the perturbation. to further investigate the observed changes in trehalose and glycogen metabolism, intracellular levels of trehalose and glycogen were measured. both reserve carbohydrates were completely degraded within  <dig> min , consistent with a post-transcriptional activation of trehalose and glycogen phosphorylases  <cit> . physiological interpretation of the trehalose and glycogen degradation however, is less straightforward, since trehalose and glycogen are known to be involved in flux regulation, stress response and cell cycle  <cit> .

delayed responses related to anaerobiosis
eighty-seven of the  <dig> genes that showed a significantly altered transcript level after the combined glucose pulse and oxygen depletion only showed an increased transcript level after  <dig> min . one of the few functional categories enriched within this group involved modification by glycosylation . pmt <dig>  pmt <dig> and pmt <dig> are specifically involved in o-linked mannosyl glycosylation, which is indispensable for cell wall integrity  <cit> . in addition, this 'delayed response' cluster contained five of the nine genes encoding anaerobically induced mannoproteins   <cit> . two other anaerobically induced mannoproteins  were initially down-regulated, whereas transcript levels of the gene encoding the major cell wall mannoprotein  did not significantly change at all.

a strongly anaerobiosis-related character of the genes in cluster d was not only suggested by the presence of the abovementioned genes involved in cell wall maintenance, but additionally by the presence of several genes involved in lipid transport , heme biosynthesis , sterol metabolism and regulation , and cell wall biosynthesis . accordingly, a high number of genes contained ar <dig> elements in their promoter , indicating a role of upc2p  <cit> . the delayed up-regulation of these 'anaerobic genes' indicated that the response to anaerobiosis is slow compared to the fast response to the relief from glucose limitation .

dissecting the response to anaerobiosis
the response to the anaerobic shift described in this study was compared with a dataset from a previously published study  <cit> , in which the transcriptional response of batch cultures was monitored for several generations after a shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. surprisingly, only  <dig> genes were overlapping with the significant up-regulated genes of our study. half of these resided in our delayed response cluster d, which contains many anaerobiosis-related genes. the absence of a glucose pulse in the study of lai et al.  <cit>  explains the absence of genes encoding components of the translational machinery among the up-regulated genes in their dataset. similarly, the large group of genes related to protein degradation found in the present study was not observed among the down-regulated genes identified by lai et al.  <cit> . a strong overlap  was found between the down-regulated genes identified in the two studies. most of this overlap resided in the constitutively low expressed clusters  <dig> &  <dig> of our study , which include many genes related to oxidative stress response. the majority of genes within the functional category stress response responded slower in the anaerobic shift study of lai et al.  <cit>  than in our study which included a step-up of the glucose concentration. hence, we conclude that the observed regulation of stress response correlated with the relief from growth limitation rather than with a mere depletion of oxygen.

anaerobic "signature" transcripts
in an attempt to identify robust 'signature transcripts' that show a consistent response to anaerobiosis, the set of significantly responding genes in this dynamic study was compared with several datasets from glucose pulses and aerobic-to-anaerobic shift experiments  <cit> .  <dig> genes of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in this study were previously identified in two other glucose-induced studies. sixty-seven of the  <dig> non-overlapping genes resided within the delayed response of cluster d, indicating that more than 70% of the genes within cluster d were not responding to glucose. twenty of these  <dig> genes are also up-regulated in the aerobic-to-anaerobic shift study of lai et al. and can therefore been seen as specifically anaerobiosis-responsive . these  <dig> anaerobic genes are involved in cell wall maintenance , in membrane composition  and metabolism . interestingly,  <dig> of those  <dig> genes resided in cluster d, and  <dig> genes contained the upc2-binding promoter element , which earlier was associated with about 1/ <dig> of anaerobic genes  <cit> . transcription factor upc <dig> has been reported to be strictly regulated by heme and sterol levels  <cit> . the delayed response of the anaerobic genes was likely due to the almost complete absence of growth during the experiment, thus sterol levels may not have been depleted rapidly through dilution over newly formed cells. a similar comparison with the down-regulated genes in our study resulted in  <dig> commonly responding genes . the majority of the anaerobic down-regulated genes had functions related to mitochondrial function or oxidative stress response, of which  <dig> genes contained a hap <dig> or hap2/3/4/ <dig> binding element  <cit> . heme levels are likely to respond rapidly to the depletion of oxygen from the culture, consistent with the fast response of the anaerobically down-regulated genes.

the use of transcripts as a diagnostic tool for biotechnological applications has been proposed previously  <cit> . based on steady-state cultivation experiments, a consistent response to anaerobiosis had been determined by analyzing aerobic and anaerobic chemostat cultures grown under different nutrient limitations , resulting in  <dig> anaerobically up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes  <cit> . surprisingly, only  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were also found in both our dynamic study and the dynamic study of lai et al.. therefore, these can be seen as true "signature" transcripts for anaerobicity both within dynamic and steady state conditions .

CONCLUSIONS
we have studied the induction of yeast fermentative capacity by switching a fully respiratory culture to fully fermentative conditions. the aerobic glucose-limited chemostat culture with a low specific growth rate became, as seen in the physiology measures, fully fermentative for the entire experiment due to a rapid depletion of oxygen and addition of a high glucose concentration . the shift caused a massive transcriptional reprogramming, where one third of all genes within the genome were transcribed differentially. our study demonstrates that, despite the complexity of this multiple-input perturbation, the transcriptional responses could be categorized and biologically interpreted. this required clustering of genes that shared discernable time-dependent responses to the perturbation, followed by a systematic analysis of overrepresented gene categories and upstream regulatory elements. this approach revealed that this reprogramming of the transcriptome was mostly driven by relief from the glucose-limitation, exemplified by preparation for faster growth  and glucose repression of various metabolic pathways. contrary to previous observations  <cit> , but as argued by lai et al  <cit> , the apparent relief from stress clearly indicates that anaerobicity per se does not evoke a stress in yeast.

a recent study by our group  <cit>  studied transcriptional responses in the first five min after a glucose pulse to aerobic, glucose limited chemostat cultures. while that study revealed important and virtually instantaneous transcriptional events after imposition of a relief from glucose limitation, the present study shows that transcriptional reprogramming continues well beyond this  <dig> min period. interestingly, most responses changed character after the  <dig> minutes point. this is clearly illustrated by the difference between the expression pattern of genes encoding ribosomal proteins versus genes encoding components for ribosomal biogenesis. therefore, we have used this experimental set-up for further studying molecular details governing the observed differences in the regulatory mechanisms of the various groups of genes .

one exception to the binary response mechanism observed around  <dig> minutes is presented by the anaerobic induction response, which appears only after the initial response to the glucose pulse. most of the genes specifically induced by anaerobiosis are related to cell wall and plasma membrane remodeling. this is in contrast with lai et al. where this response was only apparent after one generation  <cit> . the time span of anaerobic remodeling is therefore significantly shorter during a shift to complete fermentative metabolism on high glucose. by comparing this study with public datasets representing dynamic and steady conditions, the determined group of anaerobic "signature transcripts" will be better suited for use as a diagnostic tool in biotechnological applications.

most of the transcriptional changes were due to sensitivity to the carbon supply. still, the observed minor changes in transcripts for glycolytic enzymes cannot explain the 12-fold increase in flux through glycolysis under these conditions. therefore we are presently studying the central carbon metabolism under such dynamic conditions by a multilevel approach, where transcripts, enzyme activities, metabolites and fluxes will be integrated. hence, we will try to understand in more detail the regulatory mechanisms controlling fermentative capacity in yeast.
