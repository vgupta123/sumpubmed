BACKGROUND
cimex lectularius , a hematophagous ectoparasite of humans, is now spreading at alarming rates across the globe  <cit> . the bites of these nocturnal blood feeders result in cutaneous manifestations, urticarial reactions, and occasionally anaphylaxis  <cit> . further, scratching of bite sites promotes secondary bacterial infections  <cit> . though the role of c. lectularius in disease transmission remains unclear, bed bugs are known to carry methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium   <cit> . c. lectularius associated with mrsa and vre strains possibly amplify infections in impoverished urban communities  <cit> .

it has been more than half a century since c. lectularius first showed resistance to ddt  <cit> . the sudden resurgence of c. lectularius is purportedly due to increased resistance to broad-spectrum insecticides, changes in pest management practices, frequent international travel and passive dispersal   <cit> . in the recent past, c. lectularius severely affected the hospitality industry, wherein some hotels were closed due to heavy infestations  <cit> . the lack of effective pest management tools for this blood-feeding insect has led to its successful establishment around the globe  <cit> .

insects develop resistance to insecticides through four modes: penetration resistance , behavioral resistance , target site resistance , and metabolic resistance   <cit> . among these four modes, target site resistance  has been well characterized in c. lectularius  <cit> , but little to no knowledge exists regarding the other modes of resistance. recent transcriptomic studies of c. lectularius have set the foundation for understanding the potential contribution of cytochrome p450s  in pesticide resistance  <cit> . however, a more comprehensive and/or global understanding of the genes involved in pesticide resistance and their "modus operandi" in c. lectularius are necessary for understanding the genetic factors establishing resistance in c. lectularius and for improving existing control strategies or devising new ones. the next-generation sequencing  methods via different platforms  have revolutionized functional genomics research in non-model organisms  <cit> . illumina deep sequencing  has emerged as a powerful tool for simultaneous transcriptome characterization and differential gene expression  analysis to better understand eco-physiological adaptations of insects  <cit> .

in this study, we used rna-seq to compare and contrast pesticide-resistant  and pesticide-susceptible  strains of c. lectularius. as a result, we have significantly enriched the existing transcriptomic database of c. lectularius  <cit>  and subsequently identified candidate genes putatively involved in insecticide resistance. lastly, molecular docking was performed for a candidate cyp <dig> clan member  to further determine the likely contribution of p <dig> mediated insecticide resistance in c. lectularius.

RESULTS
de novo assembly
we generated  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads for two pr strains and  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads for two ps strains . an overview of the de novo assembly is shown in figure  <dig>  de novo assembly of the transcriptomes using an automated transcriptome assembly pipeline  with 'pr' sample  <dig> and ''ps' sample  <dig> resulted in  <dig>   and  <dig>   contigs, respectively . combining these contigs with previously assembled contigs   <cit>  resulted in a total of  <dig>  ests  and these were used as reference sequences . the estcalc http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/ng_sims/ngsim.pl estimated that the combined illumina reads and  <dig> datasets would cover 90% of the bed bug transcriptome .

aq <  <dig> and length <  <dig> nt were discarded; bpr, pesticide-resistant; ps, pesticide-susceptible; csequences were obtained from bai et al.  <cit> ; dfinal assembly  was obtained by combining  <dig> sequences and assemblies from pr <dig> and ps <dig> samples.

the read variation number observed in the current study has been commonly associated with the illumina platform as different lanes can produce different number of counts  <cit> . other possible reasons for read variation include different percentages of poly a+ in different samples, differential efficiency of conversion of rna to cdna, size or gc composition variation among libraries . all these factors may contribute to slight variations in the estimation of the library concentration that is applied onto the flow-cell, finally resulting in differences in cluster densities. the coverage and number of reads  obtained in this study far exceeds that of another recently published article on the c. lectularius transcriptome involving differential expression between susceptible and resistant populations  <cit> .

to determine the completeness of our final assembly, each of the derived assembled sequences was compared with its putative ortholog from acyrthosiphon pisum, anopheles gambiae, drosophila melanogaster, and pediculus humanus corporis. nearly, 33-35% of the assembled sequences exceeded a  <dig>  ortholog hit ratio and 48-50% had more than a  <dig>  ortholog hit ratio . an ortholog ratio of one indicates a fully assembled transcriptome, while a value close to zero indicates a poor assembly  <cit> . the current transcriptome characterization resulted in a 23-fold enrichment of the existing est database of c. lectularius  which allowed fine characterization of the c. lectularius transcriptome as has been observed in many non-model insect species  <cit> .

comparative genomics
about 43%  of the c. lectularius ests had one or more hits to protein sequences in the non-redundant  protein database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with the remaining sequences  being transcripts of unknown function . this is in agreement with our previous  <dig> est datasets of c. lectularius, wherein we reported a similar percentage  of est hits with the nr protein database  <cit> . the majority of tuf sequences might be due to novel transcripts or genes whose biological functions are not assigned as has been observed in other transcriptomic studies  <cit> . the top blast hits of the c. lectularius ests showed majority hits to insects  and non-insect eukaryotes ; there were a few hits  to members of bacteria . this trend in top blast hits is consistent with other ngs datasets reported for insects  <cit> . similarity searches between c. lectularius ests and protein sequences of ac. pisum, a. gambiae, d. melanogaster and p. humanus corporis revealed an overall 41% similarity , with the highest number of hits to ac. pisum  and p. humanus corporis  . this similarity of c. lectularius with ac. pisum and p. humanus corporis might be due to their phylogenetic relatedness.

functional annotation
a total of  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  ests  were annotated and gene ontology  terms were found to be distributed in a wide variety of functional categories . annotation with the d. melanogaster genome revealed a similar distribution of go categories with c. lectularius showing no notable bias towards any category. the majority of the ests annotated with biological processes were involved in development and biological regulation, while the ests annotated with molecular function revealed high catalytic and binding activity . a number of putative viral sequences were represented in the go terms for biological processes  and cellular component  . though viral transmission by c. lectularius is still not clear, the hepatitis b virus  has frequently been detected in wild c. lectularius  <cit> . future studies are required to both validate these viral sequences and determine their biological relevance within the c. lectularius genome. the assigned metabolic pathways revealed a high number of sequences  to be involved in synthesis of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleotides . these predicted pathways together with gene annotation will better help in revealing gene function in c. lectularius  <cit> .

differential gene expression
rna-seq libraries in the current study were constructed from paired biological replicates of resistant and susceptible rna samples of c. lectularius. the four rna samples were processed in two batches: batch- <dig>  and batch- <dig> . hence, we applied glmseq  analysis to the four un-normalized rna-seq counts at each est. to find differentially expressed ests, illumina counts of all four populations  were aligned to the assembled reference database which resulted in ~ <dig>  highly significant differentially expressed ests . all differentially expressed ests, along with their absolute log <dig> fold change adjusted  and their description based on blast hits, are presented in additional file  <dig> 

the primary objective of glmseq analysis was to determine the amount and significance of the main resistance effects, setting aside any secondary batch effects due to transcript-specific interactions between batch effects and resistance effects. currently available methods for rna-seq data analysis, such as deseq, are limited to one-way analysis of replicate groups and consequently cannot correctly handle two-way interactions. therefore, a custom r-script  was used to fit a two-way generalized linear model consisting of a main resistance effect and a secondary interaction effect.

go analysis of differentially expressed ests
go enrichment analysis was performed for the top  <dig>  differentially expressed ests obtained in glmseq and all of the molecular function, biological process and cellular components are shown in additional file  <dig>  we focused on molecular function in order to identify potential categories of genes that are associated with pesticide resistance, such as have been revealed in other insect studies  <cit> . of the top  <dig>  genes about  <dig> %  were up-regulated and  <dig> %  were down-regulated in the pr strains. among these,  <dig> %  of the ests had no known function  . for the up-regulated cluster of differentially expressed ests, some of the enriched go terms for molecular function included atp binding, actin binding, serine/threonine kinase activity, structural constituent of cuticle, etc. . the enriched go terms for actin binding in pr strains of c. lectularius might suggest their potential involvement in cytoskeletal networks and cellular mechanical integrity as observed in other pyrethroid-resistant insect strains  <cit> .

detoxification enrichment
we found enriched atp binding and glutathione peroxidase-associated go terms in the up-regulated cluster of differentially expressed ests suggesting the involvement of other detoxification genes such as atp binding cassette  transporters and quenchers of reactive oxygen species  , which is in agreement with other insect studies  <cit> . high occurrences of p450s  in the top  <dig>  differentially expressed ests of the c. lectularius pr strain suggest their putative role in metabolic resistance . insect p450s are one of the key players in detoxification and metabolism of a broad range of toxins including plant-synthesized and synthetic compounds  <cit> . the top differentially expressed ests were found in all the major clades of p450s  . among these, the up-regulated differentials in pr strains  were exclusively cyp <dig> clan members, which are thought to be the primary p450s involved in detoxification of xeno- and endobiotics in insects  <cit> . besides the cyp <dig> clan of p450s, cyp <dig> and mitochondrial cyp clan members are also thought to participate in insecticide resistance  <cit> . however, in the top  <dig>  differentials, the cyp <dig> and mitochondrial p <dig> members were found to be down-regulated .

cuticular enrichment
the enriched go terms for actin binding, structural constitution of cuticle, and structural constituent of muscle in pr strains of c. lectularius could imply the strengthening of structural components such as the cuticle and midgut-associated structures. indeed among the up-regulated cluster of ests, we found a high number  of transcripts encoding for cuticular proteins . cuticular proteins are major components of insect cuticle. the constitutive or induced expression of such proteins potentially establishes penetration resistance in c. lectularius, as observed in other insect systems  <cit> . it is interesting to observe that only  <dig> transcripts encoding cuticular proteins were found in the down-regulated differential cluster in pr strains of c. lectularius .

for the down-regulated cluster of differentially expressed ests, the most enriched go terms included metalloexopeptidase, aminopeptidase activities, manganese ion binding, lipid transporter activity, etc. . these trends could imply the transcriptomic adjustments within c. lectularius upon encountering insecticides. while adelman et al.  <cit>  attribute multi-level insecticide resistance of bed bugs primarily toward the activity of metabolic genes  plus kdr mutations, their analysis failed to identify major players involved in penetration resistance . further, in addition to the metabolic genes identified in their study, our unbiased/global approach identified other key players of metabolic resistance such as abc transporters and antioxidant genes .

we also screened the ests that were uniquely expressed in susceptible and resistant populations of c. lectularius, wherein a high number of ests  were found in ps strains and a few  in pr strains . in both cases, a majority of the ests were tufs . at the current time, it is too speculative to explain the uniquely expressed ests encoding for cathepsin in pr strains and rp <dig> and keratin-associated proteins among ps strains .

rna-seq validation of candidate genes
to validate the expression profiles obtained through glmseq analysis, quantitative real time rt-pcr  was performed on  <dig> selected candidate genes  belonging to the top differential cluster . except for one of the candidate genes profiled , the qrt-pcr results correlated with the glmseq profiles . the expression patterns of cyp301a <dig> of c. lectularius are in corroboration with ddt-resistant and ddt-susceptible fruit flies , wherein no appreciable differences of cyp301a <dig> transcript levels were reported between the susceptible and resistant flies. further, ddt treatment did not induce the expression levels of cyp301a <dig>  <cit> . the mitochondrial p <dig> clan members are exclusively found in animals with conserved and diversified groups potentially involved in physiological and detoxification processes in insects  <cit> . though these clan members have been well documented to detoxify insecticides and plant allelochemicals  <cit> , the cyp301a <dig> of c. lectularius might plausibly also participate in the synthesis of 20-hydroxyecdysone  as observed in other insect studies  <cit> .

the pr strains of c. lectularius displayed higher transcript levels for all of the assayed cuticular proteins  and are consistent with the rna-seq profiles . the higher expression of lcp and pcp in pr strains could contribute to increased pyrethroid resistance  <cit> . in addition to their role in other physiological processes, insects commonly up-regulate transcript levels of cuticular proteins to reduce the penetration rate of insecticides  <cit> . higher transcript levels for cda and chs could contribute altered chitin and chitosan ratios in cuticle, which influences insect survival  <cit> . co-expression of the chs and cda transcripts might potentially reduce the entry of xenobiotic compounds into the insect body. the higher expression of cpap in pr strains  indicates a possible role of the peritrophic membrane  in sequestering, detoxifying ingested xenobiotics in addition to its role in peritrophic membrane formation and protection from invasive parasites  <cit> .

all three cytochrome p450s of cyp <dig> clan members  revealed higher mrna levels in the pr strains . this is in agreement with other insect systems showing resistance to ddt or pyrethroids  <cit> . the transcript levels of a superoxide dismutase and an abc transporter were also found to be higher in the pr strains , which suggests that these proteins are potentially involved in the elimination and efflux of intracellular toxins thereby reducing their interaction with intracellular targets  <cit> . the transcripts encoding acetylcholinesterase  showed significantly higher expression in the pr strains  possibly resulting in increased production of acetylcholinesterase to minimize the toxic effects of insecticides  <cit> . the current qrt-pcr profiles of three p450s and an abc transporter together with our previous findings of a phase ii protein   <cit>  suggest a phase-wise detoxification of xenobiotic compounds in c. lectularius. further, the qrt-pcr profiles also validate our glmseq analysis employed for generating the differentially expressed ests.

tissue and development-specific expression of cyp397a1v <dig> and cyp6a13
given our interest in the role of p450s in metabolic resistance, we further profiled the transcript levels of cyp397a1v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> in different tissues  of adults and different developmental stages  of the pr and ps strains. both genes showed lesser transcript levels in ps strains, therefore the ps strains were used as a calibrator to determine fold change in tissues and developmental stages of the pr samples.

an interesting finding of this study was the peak mrna levels of cyp397a1v <dig> in the cuticle  and relatively high mrna levels in the malpighian tubules and midgut. this suggests the possible function of p450-mediated detoxification of pesticides in the cuticle of c. lectularius and/or its participation in other physiological functions. however, these findings need further functional validation. high transcript levels of both the p450s  in the malpighian tubules could also correlate with detoxification given their role in metabolism and excretion of endogenous solutes and xenobiotics  <cit> . the role of p450s in the insect midgut has been well established in detoxification as well as possible pheromone synthesis  <cit> .

the qrt-pcr analysis of cyp397a1v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> showed higher mrna levels in all developmental stages of pr compared to ps strains, specifically peak levels in early instar nymphs for cyp397a1v <dig> and late instar nymphs for cyp6a <dig> . our findings correlate with those in other insect systems and therefore suggest the up-regulation of p450s in c. lectularius to efficiently detoxify a broad range of toxic substrates at different tissue interfaces and during development  <cit> .

the expression of cyp397a1v <dig> transcripts in adults are in agreement with recent transcriptomic studies of c. lectularius  <cit> . however, our results clearly demonstrate the broader appearance of key metabolic players of both penetration resistance as well as metabolic resistance compared to adelman et al.  <cit> .

homology modeling
given the unique tissue-specific expression profiles of cyp397a1v <dig> in pr strains, the full-length sequence of cyp397a1v <dig> was obtained, which revealed all the characteristic features of a cyp <dig> clan member . a three-dimensional model for cyp397a1v <dig> was generated using human cytochrome p <dig> cyp3a <dig>  as the template . during the homology modeling process, an iron-heme molecule was included and connected by creating a covalent bond between the heme's iron atom and the sulfur atom of conserved cysteine  with the propionates of the heme interacting with the side chains of trp <dig>  arg <dig>  and arg <dig>  the cyp397a1v <dig> model displayed phenylalanine-cluster  above the active site region, with the aromatic side chains stacking against each other to form a prominent hydrophobic core. the ramachandran plot for cyp397a1v <dig> showed that approximately 94% of all residues were within the generously allowed region and  <dig> % of residues were in the disallowed region . thus, the cyp397a1v <dig> model confirms to the conserved structural folding of p450s, with some unique features including: i) the hydrophobic region was located around the loop , ii) the region following helix f appeared shorter compared to other p450s and includes a ordered stretch of polypeptide chain that does not confirm to any secondary structural motif , and iii) the catalytic pocket of the cyp397a1v <dig> displayed a smaller volume compared to other insect p <dig> proteins .

molecular docking
we used the program autodock to examine the binding mode of cyp397a1v <dig> with various insecticides , any of which c. lectularius may encounter worldwide. the binding constants and free energy change  revealed ddt, permethrin, deltamethrin and imidacloprid as potential substrates due to their tight-fit into the active site  of cyp397a1v <dig> . the moiety of ddt and permethrin molecules was located within the binding pocket, and they were adjacent to hydrophobic residues of the phenylalanine cluster, val <dig>  ala <dig>  lys <dig>  val <dig> and leu <dig> of the derived model cyp397a1v <dig> . thus, the interaction of ddt and permethrin with cyp397a1v <dig> appears to be dominated by mainly hydrophobic interactions. the insecticide substrates deltamethrin and imidacloprid were also fully enclosed by receptor residues in the cavity of cyp397a1v <dig> and were positioned well within the network of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic residues. in the case of deltamethrin and imidacloprid, the common receptor residues tyr <dig>  ala <dig> and thr <dig> contributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the cyp397a1v2-deltamethrin and cyp397a1v2-imidacloprid complex .

ddt and pyrethroids  are preferential sodium channel modulators in insects  <cit> . the frequent exposures to ddt, an early generation insecticide during the last century may have altered the development of resistance in c. lectularius to the next generation insecticides through a phenomenon called cross resistance or multi-level resistance  <cit> . the latter scenario might be the likely phenomenon associated with modern c. lectularius. our docking effort on cyp397a1v <dig> supports this hypothesis. similar observations were found in papilio glaucus, wherein pccyp6b <dig> had the ability to metabolize a broad range of substrates  <cit> . the unlikely binding of diazinon with cyp397a1v <dig> suggests potential involvement of other p450s or metabolic proteins that interact with polar compounds.

validation for kdr mutation
we also examined the pr and ps strains for mutations in the voltage-gated sodium ion channels, as this is a well-characterized kdr mechanism found in c. lectularius  <cit> . all three pr strains showed both mutations  . although the ps <dig> and ps <dig> strains did not carry any of these mutations, the ps <dig> strain showed a single mutation at v419l . these results further suggest that resistance in the pr strains could be attributed to multiple mechanisms of resistance including mutations as well as penetration and metabolic resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have developed significant molecular resources for c. lectularius and have identified several candidate genes potentially involved in different phases of insecticide metabolism as well as those participating in other modes of insecticide resistance in this species. our glmseq approach further revealed significant differentially expressed ests across biologically variant samples. specifically, the high occurrence of up-regulated cuticular proteins and the expression patterns of p450s in cuticular tissue might represent unique sites for penetration resistance as well as metabolic resistance in c. lectularius. molecular modeling and docking studies revealed the potential of p450s to metabolize multiple insecticides in c. lectularius. future functional studies  on cuticular and p <dig> proteins could lay the foundation for identifying hot-spots for insecticide resistance in c. lectularius, which could provide the basis for developing effective management strategies.
