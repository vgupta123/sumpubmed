BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a gram negative capsulated rod bacterium, is the etiologic agent of a severe, highly infectious and often fatal pleuropneumonia in swine, which is distributed world wide and results in severe losses in the swine industry. based on capsular antigens,  <dig> serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae to date have been documented, and all serotypes are capable of causing disease though differences in virulence have been described  <cit> . among these serotypes, serotype  <dig> is one of the predominant serotypes in china  <cit> .

so far, satisfactory protection has not been achieved in the a. pleuropneumoniae vaccination field in spite of intensive attempts made on inactivated whole-cell vaccines, live avirulent vaccines, which showed partial protection against challenges with homologous or heterologous serotypes <cit> . although currently available subunit vaccines contain important antigens, such as apxi, apxii and apxiii, produced in various combinations by the different serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> , they could not provide complete protection against a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> . thus identifying more conserved antigens is necessary for the development of novel vaccines, and in this study the immunogenic proteins of jl <dig> serotype  <dig> will be investigated to provide data for novel vaccine development. extracellular proteins  and omps in pathogens are involved in colonization, adhesion to and invasion of host cells. they interact directly with the host immune systems while playing crucial roles in the course of infections. thus it is feasible to identify the important vaccine candidates from these sub-fractions. currently, the immunoproteomic approach is a powerful tool to systematically identify immunogenic proteins from pathogens, and novel antigens have been successfully discovered from s. streptococcus  <cit> , b. anthrax  <cit>  and s. flexneri  <cit>  by this approach from bacterial subfractions, such as outer membrane proteins.

recently, chung et al. performed systematically proteomic analysis on omps of a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5b, and  <dig> omps were identified <cit> , and there have been attempts â€“ but they are not recent and, therefore, could not use a proteomics approach. and no attempt has been reported so far in analysis of the ecps of a. pleuropneumonae. the complete genome sequence of a. pleuropneumonia jl <dig> provided an essential database for applying immunoproteomic approach to jl <dig>  in the present study, we report this approach to jl <dig> for the first time which involved the identification of immunogenic proteins from its omps and ecps.

RESULTS
2-de profile of the ecps and omps, immunoblotting analysis and identification of immunogenic proteins
in the present study, linear immobilized ph gradient strips  and 10% sds-page gels were used for the prepared samples separation. figure 1a and 1b show the 2-de profile of omps and ecps of a. pleuropneumoniae jl <dig>  the 2-de and immunoblotting were repeated three times and the results were reproducible. a total of  <dig> spots and  <dig> spots were detected on the silver-stained gels of omps and ecps respectively by the software imagemaster v  <dig> . after immunoblotting analysis with convalescent sera,  <dig> immunoreactive spots from omps  were identified, and they represented  <dig> proteins. chung et al. recently identified  <dig> om proteins from a. pleuropneumoniae 5b with an optimized extraction protocol based on the sucrose-density gradient which yielded preparations highly enriched for om proteins and lipoproteins <cit> , and  <dig> of the  <dig> om proteins were identified as immunogenic proteins in this study. in addition, rhonda et al. recently demonstrated the sucrose-density gradient extraction of outer membranes in campylobacter jejuni produced purer sample than carbonate extraction  <cit>  that was applied in this study. so further study needs to be tried on immunoproteomic analysis of other serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae with the optimized omp extraction protocol of chung et al. for search of more immunogenic omps. all the  <dig> immunoreactive spots from ecps  that represented  <dig> proteins were identified whereas no specific immunoreactive protein spot was observed from omps and ecps using control sera. the detailed peptide mass fingerprinting  results of the immunoreactive proteins are listed in supplemental table s <dig> . overall, values of gel estimated pi and mw are matched well with their theoretical ones but some discrepancies still exist. similar migration for several proteins has been observed in proteomic analysis of other pathogens previously <cit> . this might be due to the presence of natural isoforms, posttranslational processing, and/or modification, or an artifact caused by sample preparation.

all identified proteins were predicted by psortb  <dig> ,  <dig> proteins are annotated as periplasmic proteins,  <dig> are omps,  <dig> are extracellular proteins,  <dig> are cytoplasmic proteins,  <dig> is cytoplasmic membrane protein, and  <dig> are unknown. the detailed functions of the identified immunoreactive proteins are shown in supplemental table s <dig>  according to the results predicted by cognitor.

interestingly,  <dig> immunogenic proteins, momp <dig>  momp <dig> and elongation factor tu were identified from omps and ecps simultaneously, which might be due to outer membrane vesicles released in the milieu  <cit> , from which outer membrane proteins have been identified successfully from e. coli and a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> , and to dual localization of elongation factor tu  <cit> .

characterization of identified immunogenic proteins
our immunogenic approach led to the identification of  <dig> known antigens of a. pleuropneumoniae, namely momp <dig>  momp <dig>  apxiia, apxiiia, na+-translocating nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit a  and outer membrane ferric hydroxamate receptor  <cit> . and other well-known antigens, like apxi, apxiv, outer membrane lipoprotein a , outer membrane protein precursor  and transferrin binding proteins  proteins could not be detected in the present study. apxiv is only induced in vivo and jl <dig>  serotype  <dig> strain, can not produce apxi, and therefore we could not detect apxi and apxiv. tbp proteins are expressed under iron limited conditions and the cells we collected were not prepared under such conditions. so tbp proteins did not appear in our results. the highly hydrophobic nature of omla and pala might cause their loss during extraction procedure. pala has been proved to be detrimental when used in vaccines <cit> , and thus we should be cautious about similar immunogenic proteins while applying them to vaccine development.

in addition, we found  <dig> immunogenic proteins that had an significant sequence similarity to known proteins, and they have already been shown immunogenic in certain pathogenic bacteria, but not in a. pleuropneumoniae before, namely d15/ompd, lppb, frda, mdh, fepa, frpb, tufb, potd, gapa, znua, tig, degp, tufb, psaa, fkpa and pta. the homolog d15/omp <dig> is an essential component for outer membrane biogenesis and omp assembly  <cit> . the immunogenicity of d <dig> and its homolog omp <dig> has been demonstrated in haemophilus ducreyi  <cit>  and pasteurella multocida  <cit>  respectively. furthermore, antibodies against the cooh-terminal "surface antigen" domain of d <dig> are protective against haemophilus influenzae infection in animal models  <cit> . the immunoreactive spot o <dig> was homologous to lppb and shared 49% sequence identity with lppb of h. somni that has been shown as an immunodominant protein  <cit> , and the gene lppb of a. pleuropneumoniae is important for survival during infection <cit> . fumarate reductase  was found to be involved in biosynthesis of flagella and cell motility, which might contribute to an significantly attenuated a. pleuropneumoniae  <cit>  and loss of the ability in colonizing in the gastric mucosa in helicobacter pylori <cit>  after frda genes were inactivated. furthermore, joseph et al. described frda as an antigen in brucella abortus  <cit> . fepa, frpb and hbpa are important components in several abc transport pathways for obtaining iron or regulating iron utilization in vivo or vitro. the immunogenic activity of fepa and frpb was shown in klebsiella pneumoniae  <cit>  and neisseria meningitides  <cit>  respectively, and hbpa was widely conserved and served as an antigen in leptospira interrogans <cit> . moreover, homologous analysis of these proteins at ncbi revealed a high level identity  with the sequenced serotype  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains respectively. these suggest that they might be new common antigens for a. pleuropneumoniae. high-affinity zinc uptake system protein znua precursor, was essential of b. abortus for intracellular survival and virulence in mice <cit>  and shown immunogenic in streptococcus suis <cit> . psaa is needed for the adherence of pneumococcal cells and antibodies to psaa contributed to reduce the nasopharyngeal colonization of challenged pneumococcal cells  <cit> . degps, a member of the widely conserved htra family of serine proteases, were frequently identified as antigens in other pathogens, such as b. abortus  <cit>  and chlamydia trachomatis  <cit> . besides, trigger factor  has been demonstrated to be an excellent candidate for vaccination against brucella melitensis  <cit>  and a virulence-related protein in listeria monocytogenes  <cit> , and similar findings were described about malate dehydrogenase  of candida albicans  <cit>  and spermidine/putrescine-binding periplasmic protein  of streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  has been proven to be antigenically conserved proteins, suggesting potential for vaccines in several microorganisms  <cit> . homologous protein of translation elongation factor ef-tu , a very abundant protein, had been detected in immunological researches of other bacteria, such as c. trachomatis <cit>  and shigella flexneri <cit> . the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria is well equipped with atp-independent chaperones and folding catalysts, including peptidyl-prolyl isomerases . it is reported recently that fkpa was found to be immunogenic in bordetella pertussis <cit> . phosphate acetyltransferase , an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl phosphate to coenzyme a plays a major role in the energy-yielding metabolism <cit>  and recently has been reported to be immunogenic in s. suis <cit> .

it is notable that cbik, ilvg, fepb, afuc, fatb, ggbp, cysg and ttg2d, are reported to be immunogenic proteins for the first time in this study whose functions have been biologically demonstrated in some bacteria. putative periplasmic binding protein cbik is involved in the uptake of ni2+, a cofactor required for urease activity that is important in pathogenesis of pleuropneumonia  <cit> . the ilv gene of brucella suis has been identified as a virulence gene <cit> , and its product, acetohydroxyacid synthase, catalyzes the first common step in the biosynthetic pathway of the branched-amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. iron is essential for bacterial growth, especially for a. pleuropneumoniae in invading and reproducing in porcine respiratory tract where iron is limited. iron-restriction is an important signal that regulates expression of many genes including some coding for virulence factors <cit> . fepb, afuc and fatb are components of known iron transport pathways, and the immunogenic reactivity of these proteins in this study indicates that these iron-uptake proteins might be potential candidates for development of subunit vaccines. d-galactose/d-glucose binding protein  is a bacterial periplasmic protein, an initial component for both chemotaxis towards galactose and glucose and active transport of the two sugars in escherichia coli <cit> . the crystal structure of uroporphyrinogen-iii methylase  from thermus thermophilus has been reported <cit>  and the cysg gene of salmonella typhimurium is involved in synthesis of both cobalamin  and siroheme <cit> . the ttg2d gene encodes a periplasmic component of an abc-type transport system related to resistance to organic solvents, and ttg proteins of pseudomonas putida and n. meningitidis were verified to participate in the uptake of l-glutamate <cit> .

novel vaccine candidates need to be highly conserved between strains and so that they induce cross-protection against a. pleuropneumoniae. recently goure et al. have identified a. pleuropneumoniae genes that are conserved among all  <dig> serotypes by comparative genomic hybridization <cit> . of these conserved genes, the genes encoding proteins momp <dig> , momp <dig> , d <dig> , lppb, potd, fkbp and frpb were observed in our results. besides, nqra has been demonstrated to be common to all serotypes <cit> . thus these conserved proteins could potentially induce protection against a wide variety of strains and are attractive vaccine candidates.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the 2de in combination with western blot is a specific and powerful method to discover novel antigens from bacterial pathogens. in this study, the identified immunogenic proteins from ecps and omps may be significant for the development of new efficient vaccine against a. pleuropneumoniae. the protective efficacy of the identified immunogenic proteins either by alone or in different combinations remains to be evaluated in further studies. the data of this study are expected to aid in development of novel vaccines against a. pleuropneumoniae. the present study has focused on 2de analysis coupled with western blotting.
