BACKGROUND
fluorescent nucleotides have become widely utilized tools in basic research  <cit> , and the number of corresponding reports on their use in cellular systems is vast. however studies involving the second messenger camp have not kept pace, and studies using fluorescently tagged camp analogs are still limited.

early reports mainly used nucleobase-modified analogs where the purine ring system was part of the fluorophore, such as  <dig>  n6- etheno-camp  <cit> , 2- aza-  <dig>  n6- etheno-camp  <cit>  or the cyclic phosphate of 2- aminopurine riboside  <cit> . however, these compounds are far from being optimal with regard to membrane permeability, camp-dependent protein kinase  binding affinity and stability towards phosphodiesterases . further more, the fluorophores lack brilliance and possess unfavorable spectral properties, e.g., excitation is to be performed in the uv range, which can be harmful to intact cells and monitoring of the relatively short emission wavelengths is often disturbed by intrinsic fluorescent components of the cell.

for studies involving pdes, anthraniloyl  <cit> - and methylanthraniloyl- modified  <cit>  camp  have been introduced, where the ribose 2- position carries a fluorescent reporter group. since the 2'- modification render these structures unable to activate pka, the mant group has been linked to the positions  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  of the adenine nucleobase as well . according to corresponding lipophilicity data , cyclic nucleotides with mant modification have improved membrane permeability and better pde-resistance , but are still suboptimal with respect to their spectral properties. the same holds true for camp modified with the nbd fluorophore amino]ethyl]thio]adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate; 8-nbd-camp)  <cit> .

fluorescein and rhodamine have been attached to the 8- position of camp as well  <cit> , however, in spite of the improved spectral properties of these dyes, both conjugates are not membrane permeable due to an additional charge within the dye moiety. unfortunately, nearly all modern fluorescent dye structures contain positive or negative charges which support the electronic push/pull mechanism of the respective chromophore but render the corresponding conjugates rather polar, especially when attached to nucleotides with their polar phosphate groups. even camp conjugates with state-of-the-art dyes such as cy <dig>  <cit> , evoblue, and bodipy®  <cit> , which have excellent spectral properties, fail to pass cellular membranes, and require invasive application techniques like patch clamp or microinjection or the osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles  <cit>  and are mainly utilized in vitro assays. importantly, if these dyes are connected to the 2'- ribose moiety, the resulting conjugates will not bind to and activate pka anymore. finally, phosphate-modified caged camp analogs have been described, which – upon photo-activation – release camp together with fluorescent coumarines  <cit> .

thus, in spite of quite a number of different fluorescent variants of camp, these structures have only limited application scopes, and presently no analog is available that offers improved properties in all important aspects mentioned, and which could be used with intact cells for tracking or intracellular imaging experiments.

the main effector enzyme of camp is the camp-dependent protein kinase , which reversibly phosphorylates substrate proteins. protein kinases and their counter players, phosphatases and camp-degrading pdes, are key regulatory enzymes in eukaryotic cells. pka is a multi-substrate enzyme mediating the majority of the known effects of camp by regulating the activity of proteins involved in signal transduction, energy metabolism, cell proliferation, and differentiation  <cit> . in the absence of camp, all pka isoforms consist of two regulatory  and two catalytic subunits  that form an inactive tetramer. binding of at total of four camp molecules to the two tandem camp binding sites of each r subunit promotes the dissociation of the holoenzyme complex and leads to the release of the now active c subunits phosphorylating target proteins in the cytosol or in the nucleus  <cit> . main isoforms of the c subunit are cα, cβ, cγ and prkx, and several minor isoforms have been identified at least at cdna level. in human, four different isoforms of the r subunit  have been identified  <cit> .

besides pka and its corresponding signaling pathway, camp addresses additional cellular targets such as cyclic nucleotide-dependent ion channels  as well as the exchange protein directly activated by camp , which are worthwhile objects for evaluation with fluorescent analogs  <cit> .

in view of the importance of the camp messenger system, improved tools for a more detailed investigation of functions and receptor distribution would be quite helpful. thus, in this study, the properties of a novel commercially available conjugate of camp with the pharos dye, 8-- adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate  and the corresponding free dye were investigated and analyzed physico-chemically , with respect to pka-ri and -rii subunit binding as well as holoenzyme activation in vitro and in living cells, pde-resistance, and cellular uptake.

RESULTS
photochemical characterization of the pharos dye
first we determined the photo-chemical properties of the free pharos dye. the stokes shift at ph  <dig> , ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  was  <dig> nm resulting from an absorption maximum at  <dig> nm and an emission maximum at  <dig> nm . 8--camp behaved similarly with an excitation maximum at  <dig> nm and emission maximum at  <dig> nm at ph  <dig>  .

to calculate the relative quantum yield ϕ of the pharos dye the absorption  and fluorescence  spectra of several pharos dye concentrations  were recorded using quinine sulfate as a standard  <cit> . the determination of the relative quantum yield is generally accomplished by plotting the integrated fluorescence intensity versus the absorbance at the excitation wavelength . by comparing the slope of the linear regression  with that of a standard substance , the relative quantum yield of the pharos dye was determined to be 30%.

spectral properties of 8--camp upon binding to pka r-subunits
8--camp was incubated with or without a fourfold molar excess of riα, riiα and riiβ subunits . the excitation spectra  were detected at em  <dig> nm and ex  <dig> nm- <dig> nm; the emission spectra  were detected at ex  <dig> nm and em  <dig> nm –  <dig> nm. upon addition of riiα and riiβ subunits we observed an increase of the amplitude of excitation and emission maxima, whereas the interaction of the analog with riα protein had no significant effect. furthermore, a slight shift of the excitation and emission spectra to shorter wavelengths  was found with all three r subunits.

8--camp binding to pka r subunits and activation of pka
it has been shown that camp analogs, modified in position  <dig> of the adenine nucleobase, are powerful activators of protein kinase a, and even rather bulky substituents are accepted here. in addition, all analogs modified with fluorophores of high molecular weight and steric demands were reported to be potent pka agonists <cit> .

to investigate the binding of 8--camp to ri and rii subunits, we employed a fluorescent polarization displacement assay using  <dig>  nm r subunit. displacement of 8-fluo-camp bound to the r subunits was followed by allowing either camp or 8--camp to compete with 8-fluo-camp binding. in the case of riα, we found 8--camp and camp bound equally well to the r subunit . in case of riiα and riiβ, camp was about  <dig> times and  <dig> times more efficient in displacing 8-fluo-camp compared to 8--camp, respectively . with respect to both, isoform and site selectivity, and considering the bulky substituent in position  <dig> of the adenine nucleobase, it could have been expected that 8--camp prefers the b- site of pka type ii. however, our data show that binding to riα is comparable to camp, whereas a lower affinity of 8--camp for rii isoforms was detected. in this respect, 8--camp acts similar to 8-fluo-camp, which shows rather high affinity for the site bii along with rather lower affinity to aii, but a quite equal binding capacity to both sites a and b of ri, thus resulting in an overall higher binding to riα  <cit> , analogous to other 8-substituted analogs  <cit> .

we next investigated the ability of 8--camp to activate pka-i and -ii holoenzymes side by side. riα, riiα and riiβ each were allowed to form a holoenzyme complex with the cα subunit, before adding increasing amounts of either camp or 8--camp to re-activate the cα-subunit. kinase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically  <cit> , using the synthetic heptapeptide kemptide as a substrate. the binding properties of 8--camp to the riα subunit is reflected in a nearly identical activation titration curve and corresponding activation constant comparing analog  with camp . however, activation of riiα and riiβ holoenzymes was less cooperative using 8--camp, indicated by a more shallow hill slope of the activation titration curves . the corresponding apparent activation constants  were about two-fold increased for 8--camp compared to camp .

uptake of 8--camp in living cells and activation of pka
insights into the intracellular distribution within eukaryotic cells were obtained by intracellular imaging of the cyclic nucleotide analog. 8--camp clearly enters the cultivated hek <dig> and cho cells. in most cases it displays a spotty distribution inside the cells and seems to accumulate in bright aggregates over a diffusely labeled background. the nuclear compartment was unlabeled in most cells . in some experiments, employing cos- <dig> cells less than 5% of the cells showed an accumulation of the compound in the nucleus, which might be attributable to apoptotic degeneration of the cells . variations in the incubation procedure  did not significantly change the distribution pattern or the accumulation in bright spots. however, an incubation temperature of 4°c led to a markedly reduced uptake and accumulation of the compound . this could indicate that membrane trafficking, which is inhibited at 4°c, is part of the accumulation process. whether pinocytotic uptake of the compound or exocytotic processes involving camp are inhibited  <cit> , deserves further study. the free pharos dye efficiently diffuses within the cells and does not accumulate in spots like 8--camp does .

it has previously been shown that fluorescent camp analogs were able to label riα aggregates, respectively  <cit> . we therefore investigated whether the compound co-localizes with gfp-tagged riα and riiα proteins expressed in cos- <dig> cells, and indeed we found co-localization of 8--camp, but not the free dye, with r subunits , indicating that the accumulation of the fluorescent camp might be in part due to association to  camp binding proteins. however, we can not entirely exclude unspecific aggregation of 8--camp.

in contrast to many other modern fluorophores, the pharos chromophore has considerably reduced bulkiness along with high lipophilicity. thus, 8--camp has a lower molecular weight compared to e.g. fluorescein-modified-camp  amino]ethyl]thio]adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate; 8-fluo-camp). due to its merely hydrophobic character, the dye has a big impact on the analog overall lipophilicity, which in turn should compensate the negative charge of the cyclic phosphate and finally lead to good membrane permeability of 8--camp. in lipophilicity measurements using reversed phase hplc  <cit> , its logkw was determined to be  <dig>  resulting in a more than  <dig> times increased lipophilicity compared to camp . in this respect the analog resembles highly membrane-permeant pka agonists such as sp- <dig> -dcl-cbimps  <cit>  or the epac activator 8-pcpt-2'-o-me-camp  <cit> , and surpasses all fluorescent camp analogs described so far. we therefore investigated the kinetics of 8--camp uptake in living cells using a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator  formed by a camp binding domain from epac and two spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein   <cit> . its functioning is based on the phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer . fret relies on a non-radiative, distance-dependent transfer of energy between the two fluorescent domains: by exciting the first, the emission from the second one can be detected. since fret depends on the distance between the two fluorophores which in turn is ligand-dependent, this probe is used to estimate the intracellular level of camp or -analogs.

the cells were treated with  <dig> μm 8--camp for one hour and, during this period, fret ratio increased linearly . on the basis of the camp dose-fret response curve  <cit> , we estimate that about  <dig> μm 8--camp is available to the intracellular fluorescent indicator. the same experiments were performed using sp- <dig> -dcl-cbimps, a highly membrane permeable camp analog  <cit> . in this case, after  <dig> minutes of treatment, the fluorescent probe was almost completely saturated , indicating that sp- <dig> -dcl-cbimps crosses the plasma membrane more efficiently compared to 8--camp, in contrast to the retention based lipophilicity measurements on hplc, where the analogs behaved more similarly. we can not exclude, however, that the epac- based fret sensor used for the measurements preferentially binds sp- <dig> -dcl-cbimps.

as the reduced intracellular availability of 8--camp could also be due to intracellular pde-mediated degradation, we tested stability of the compound towards a camp-specific pde isoform  in vitro using a coupled spectrophotometric activity assay  <cit> . no degradation of 8--camp was detected during the  <dig> minutes of assay duration . the specific activity of the enzyme was  <dig>  u/mg for camp. it has been demonstrated before, that 8-modified camp analogs possess considerably high resistance towards pde degradation  <cit> . absolutely stable analogs would arise from conjugating the pharos fluorophore to phosphorothioate- modified structures such as rp- or sp-camps .

we next tested if 8--camp can activate the pka holoenzyme in living cos- <dig> cells using a recently established bioluminescence resonance energy transfer  based reporter for pka-iiα, based on transient co-expressed luciferase-tagged riiα and  as the bret donor and a gfp-tagged cα subunit  as the bret acceptor. in this assay, a decrease in bret signal indicates intracellular dissociation of the pka holoenzyme  <cit> . as depicted in figure 8a, the camp analog efficiently allows the pka subunits to dissociate. half-maximal holoenzyme dissociation was achieved at a concentration of about  <dig> μm analog added to the cells. this value in the same range as the value for e.g. 8-br-camp  but is surpassed by acetoxymethyl esters of cyclic nucleotides, that activate pka in the low μm range determined by bret  <cit>  as well as in physiological assays  <cit> . finally, we performed a bystander bret test  <cit> , where cos- <dig> cells were transfected with a constant amount of donor-expression plasmid  and with increasing amounts of acceptor-expression plasmid . the cells were incubated with  <dig> μm 8--camp for  <dig> minutes prior to the bret ratio determination, or mock treated. figure 8b depicts the normalized bret-values of two experiments each performed with n =  <dig> wells per incubation. when no bret acceptor is expressed in the cells, we observed the background bret value, and the incubation with 8--camp has no effect. with increasing amounts of acceptor dna, the bret values rises and reaches an asymptote at the 1: <dig> molar ratio at  <dig>  μg donor and acceptor coding dna each, as expected from a 1: <dig> interaction of pka subunits in the holoenzyme. thereafter the bret value does not increase further, indicating a specific interaction, which can be prohibited to about 50% by incubation with  <dig> μm 8--camp, as determined previously .

CONCLUSIONS
we can conclude that 8--camp with its modern, red-shifted fluorophore is a useful, stable tool for in vitro and in vivo investigation of camp binding proteins. it spontaneously enters eukaryotic cells and can be sequestered to pka regulatory subunits. however, undesired partial accumulation in the cell could not be entirely excluded in this study. it efficiently binds to and activates pka-i and -ii, and should have great potential for many cell biological and in vitro applications.
