BACKGROUND
tropheryma whipplei is a gram positive bacterium responsible for whipple's disease  <cit> . this chronic, multisystemic infection is mainly characterized by intestinal malabsorption, but also involves other organs such as the heart and central nervous system and is ultimately fatal without appropriate treatment  <cit> . t. whipplei infection in human beings is particularly interesting due to the wide range of disease outcomes  <cit> . while it is known to be associated with the environment  <cit> , the natural reservoir of t. whipplei is still unknown.

in  <dig>  the first human isolate of this bacterium was successfully cultured in a fibroblast cell line  <cit> . this allowed investigators to examine the phenotypic characteristics of the bacterium, about which little had been known  <cit> , and made possible the sequencing of the  <dig>  mb genome  <cit> . this major achievement has provided new perspectives on both the diagnosis and treatment of whipple's disease  <cit> . among the first post-genomic applications was the successful design of a comprehensive culture medium, based on computer modeling of metabolic networks, which allowed the axenic growth of the microorganism  <cit> . the use of the axenic culture medium for diagnostic purposes has enabled isolation of several t. whipplei strains from cerebrospinal fluid, blood, synovial fluid, lymph node, cardiac valve, skeletal muscle, and stool  <cit> . t. whipplei replication in the absence of eukaryotic cells has also facilitated the immunoproteomic analysis of this pathogen, which was conducted using sera from patients  <cit> . finally, the absence of eukaryotic nucleic acids favored optimization of rna extraction  <cit> , thus making microarray-based transcriptional studies possible  <cit> .

the dna microarrays allow for the identification of changes in gene expression in response to specific stimuli from the environment on a global scale. this technology also provides a powerful tool to study genome variability among strains. thus, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  was described as a good alternative to whole genome sequencing  <cit> , and has been applied for several human pathogens  <cit> . such an approach was shown to be useful to assess genome plasticity and evolutionary trends including analysis of potential gene transfer events  <cit> . moreover, cgh analysis was found to be helpful in revealing gene polymorphisms associated with distinct tissue tropisms or niche adaptation  <cit> , in characterizing virulence factors  <cit>  and in providing putative vaccine candidate antigens  <cit> .

to date, two t. whipplei strains have been sequenced, tw08/ <dig>  <cit>  and twist  <cit> . these strains were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid collected in germany  <cit>  and the cardiac valve of a canadian patient  <cit> , respectively. a comparative analysis of the two strains revealed a large chromosomal inversion. this observation, associated with a high nucleotide identity between both strains , was considered to be an indication of a very active genome rearrangement process  <cit> . such genomic recombination was hypothesized to be mediated by the wnd protein-coding repeats within genes encoding the wisp membrane proteins and to be associated with changes in the set of proteins exposed at the surface of the bacteria. according to this perspective, recombination would constitute an adaptive response to the host defense or to environmental conditions.

due to the variable pathological profiles which can result from t. whipplei infection, we hypothesized that it could be of interest to further define the genetic diversity of various strains. to obtain information on t. whipplei gene content, we performed a comparative analysis of sixteen clinical isolates by cgh using the whole t. whipplei twist strain cdna microarray. results were subsequently validated by pcr and sequencing.

RESULTS
accuracy of genomic dna hybridization on t. whipplei microarray
screening for divergent or absent regions in t. whipplei strains isolated in our laboratory was carried out using a microarray chip containing pcr products from  <dig> genes corresponding to  <dig> % of the t. whipplei twist genome  <cit> . in the first step, the accuracy of the t. whipplei genomic dna hybridization assays was determined through control experiments self-hybridizing cy5-labeled twist with cy3-labeled twist. as expected, the corresponding gack analysis, which allows coding sequence  classification as either conserved or absent/divergent using a trinary output under stringent conditions  <cit> , showed that 100% of the cdss were present. no hybridization was observed against negative control dnas present on the microarrays. accordingly, we concluded that both experimental and computational processing were appropriate for analyzing our data.

global analysis of conserved and divergent cdss in the t. whipplei genome
given the estimated probability of cds presence deduced from the gack analysis of the  <dig> hybridization profiles obtained, it appeared that t. whipplei genomic sequences were highly conserved across the  <dig> isolates tested . these  <dig> hybridizations consisted of three repeats of the hybridization of  <dig> distinct t. whipplei isolates vs. the twist strain. comparative analysis showed that relative to the twist isolate, the percentage of conserved cdss ranges from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . the heat map visualization of genomic variations showed that there were differences spread across the entire genomes . only  <dig> genes from the twist isolate were predicted to be absent or highly divergent in at least one tested strain. reduced hybridization can result either from whole gene deletion or from nucleotide sequence variation. in order to clarify the nature of the observed deletion/divergence, pcr were performed using specific primers located upstream and downstream of the targeted cdss. the electrophoresis migration profile obtained for twt <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  analysis of the  <dig> deletions/divergences showed a reduced pcr amplicon size consistent with the gene deletion observed in the  <dig> cases . sequencing of the pcr products with the same migration profile as those obtained from the t. whipplei twist strain indicated that the lower hybridization resulted from a sequence variation in 43/ <dig> genes. further analysis of nucleotide changes resulted in the identification of one silent mutation . the genes were interrupted by stop codons in  <dig> cases, and  <dig> of these were related to twt <dig>  which encodes a protein of unknown function. the observed sequence divergences mainly induce amino acid changes. interestingly, when a gene exhibited variations in several strains, the amino acid changes they trigger were found to be partly conserved . in two cases of genes encoding proteins of unknown function, twt <dig> and twt <dig>  the predicted deletion/divergence was not associated with nucleotide changes. these false-positive values were not included in the dendrogram established from the overall cgh assay including sequencing data. as shown in figure  <dig>  dig <dig>  dig <dig>  slow <dig>  endo <dig>  endo <dig>  art <dig> and digmus <dig> formed a group distinct from neuro <dig>  digadp <dig>  neuro <dig>  digneuro <dig>  dig <dig>  digneuro <dig>  slow1b; and twist. dig <dig> appeared to be phylogenically distinct from all other isolates.

major genomic changes are related to genes encoding for wisp family proteins
the distribution of the  <dig> absent/divergent cdss was analyzed according to their functional classification. of these,  <dig> genes encoded hypothetical proteins. this corresponds to 10% of unknown genes annotated in the t. whipplei twist genome. the functional category exhibiting the most number of genes altered, including both deletions and mutations, corresponds to membrane proteins. thus, 4/ <dig> proteins  in the wisp family were found to be absent or divergent. while most of the genes  exhibited divergence in only  <dig> of the  <dig> examined strains, more frequent changes were observed in the wisp family proteins . twt <dig> and twt <dig> sequence variations were observed in  <dig> and  <dig> t. whipplei strains, respectively, while twt <dig> was found to be absent in  <dig> strains and divergent in another one. with the exception of slow1b, digneuro <dig> and neuro <dig> strains, the wisp proteins differed from twist in all t. whipplei strains. other cds variations shared by several t. whipplei strains encode either hypothetical proteins , membrane proteins , or ftse, a cell division atp-binding protein .

cgh analysis reveals a major deletion in t. whipplei dig15
a more detailed analysis was then performed on the genomic region of t. whipplei dig <dig> strain ranging from twt <dig> to twt <dig>  several genes consecutively located in this region were predicted to be absent/divergent in this strain, and other genes were characterized as uncertain . pcr assays were thus designed to bridge each of the putatively deleted regions. a  <dig>  bp amplicon was amplified using forward and reverse primers located on twt <dig> and twt <dig>  and further sequenced to determine the exact location of the deletion event . these data demonstrated that all  <dig> cdss located between twt <dig> and twt <dig> were absent in t. whipplei dig <dig>  half of these corresponded to proteins with unknown functions . genes encoding previously characterized proteins such as reca and ftsk were also absent. the gc% value of this deleted region was  <dig> %, compared to  <dig> % for the whole genome  <cit> . interestingly, the boundaries of this deleted genomic region are two genes that belong to the wisp membrane protein family, namely twt <dig> and twt <dig>  the sizes of these genes in the t. whipplei twist strain are  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides, respectively. both genes share an n-terminal wnd domain that could trigger a recombination event. from blast analysis, both genes were found to be 99% identical over a  <dig> bp nucleotide fragment. in the dig <dig> sequenced amplicon, the region without blast similarities to twt <dig>  twt <dig> or their adjacent intergenic spacer is only  <dig> nucleotides. this indicates that the recombination event induced a deletion around  <dig> kb within the wnd domain-containing wisp proteins. this deletion was also observed by pcr in the primary isolate stored after the first passage in the fibrosblast cell line . this putative recombination event is shown in figure  <dig>

discussion
one of the major results from the cgh analysis performed with a microarray composed of pcr products amplified from the  <dig>  mb t. whipplei twist genome  <cit> , is the remarkable preservation of the genomic content of the  <dig> t. whipplei isolates. as previously claimed  <cit> , one of the limitations of this technique is the failure to detect genes that were not spotted on the microarrays. however, the high genomic conservation rate observed in this study is consistent with the fact that t. whipplei gene family size is an ancestral feature. this suggests an evolutionary scenario where the isolates originating from diverse sources have all evolved from a common ancestor.

the percentage of t. whipplei twist probes exhibiting differential hybridization in other strains is in the same range as those described for the francisella tularensis  <cit> , chlamydia trachomatis  <cit> , coxiella burnetii  <cit> , and rickettsia prowazekii species  <cit> . a common trait among these pathogens and t. whipplei is a small genome size between  <dig> – <dig>  mb, a marked at nucleotide bias, and the loss of several metabolic pathways, which explains their complex nutritional requirements  <cit> . while f. tularensis can replicate under axenic conditions in vitro, it is thought that obligate host-dependent survival is required in its natural life cycle  <cit> . the strictly intracellular niche of t. whipplei is still under debate. however, the high level of similarity between t. whipplei strains strongly suggests that these microorganisms are mainly associated with host cells in vivo. while free-living and facultative intracellular bacteria might be constantly bombarded with foreign genes, genetic exchange opportunities are limited for obligate intracellular bacteria, which may result in few evolutionary events of gene transfer  <cit> . in contrast to what was observed for t. whipplei and other host-associated pathogens, the cgh analysis performed on enteric bacteria including salmonella enterica  <cit> , campylobacter jejuni  <cit> , helicobacter pylori  <cit> , shigella  <cit>  or enterococcus faecalis  <cit>  evidenced  <dig> to 23% genetic variations.

among the  <dig> lacking or divergent cdss found in at least one of the tested strains,  <dig> encode for proteins of unknown function, which can be considered non-essential for bacterial survival and replication. this is mainly the case for twt <dig> and twt099-encoded proteins, which are deleted and interrupted, respectively, in several t. whipplei strains. while strain-specific divergences were shown for deod , ksga , and trpe , nucleotide changes in ftse were observed in  <dig> % of isolates. these modifications lead to amino acid changes in  <dig> isolates, the gene being interrupted in the fifth one. alignment of the whole ftse twist gene  <cit>  with the tw08/ <dig> gene  <cit>  showed 70% similarity, which is in disagreement with the 99% identity of both genomes at the nucleotide sequence level  <cit> . recent evidence showed that ftse was absolutely required for the process of bacterial division in low osmotic strength conditions, because this protein ensures the stability of the septal ring assembly  <cit> . in contrast, this abc transporter-type protein was described as non-essential for bacteria grown under high-osmolarity conditions, as shown by viable ftse null mutants  <cit> . relationships between mutations within the aeromonas hydrophila ftse gene and the filamentous phenotype of the bacteria, which likely interferes with opsonophagocytosis, were also observed  <cit> . these authors hypothesized that the formation of large bacterial aggregates that could not be ingested by phagocytic cells could be used to evade the immune system. the relevance of ftse changes for each t. whipplei strains is questionable, but it can be hypothesized that the protein plays a role in adaptating to environmental change.

this cgh analysis showed that the wisp proteins, heterogeneous surface proteins grouped into a family based on several identifying features including wnd repeats  <cit> , are highly divergent across the t. whipplei strains compared in this study. a high divergence rate of genes related to surface structure proteins has been described for several pathogens including yersinia pestis  <cit> , campylobacter jejuni  <cit> , and shigella  <cit> . the heterogeneity of the t. whipplei wisp proteins is consistent with observations made in previous studies using a shotgun sequence assembly of the t. whipplei strain tw08/ <dig>  <cit> . indeed, these authors provided evidence for the existence of  <dig> loci located within the wisp coding sequence tw <dig>  where variations that mainly resulted in single amino acid changes were observed. pcr amplification and sequencing of the n-terminal region of this gene further revealed variations when the same culture was collected at different passages  <cit> . comparing different isolates showed that twt <dig> and twt <dig>  which are partly homologous to the tw <dig> gene of t. whipplei tw08/ <dig> strain, either exhibited several amino acid mutations or were lacking. amino acid changes were observed in the wisp protein encoded by twt <dig> in  <dig> isolates, and a frame-shift mutation was found in another strain. deletion of the gene encoding the twt <dig> wisp protein was observed in 43% of the strains analyzed. while  <dig> % of the t. whipplei cdss appeared to have diverged in the twist strain relative to the other  <dig> strains tested, this value increased to  <dig>  % when genes that belong to the wisp protein family were considered. these data emphasize the diversity of such membrane proteins across various strains. altogether, these findings suggest that divergent evolution of this select set of genes could be associated with development of bacteria which have similar genomic contents, in different environments. wisp proteins exhibit amino acid hypervariation that could be responsible for various pathological features and immune system evasion.

there was a notable deletion of  <dig> cdss corresponding to  <dig>  kb in the t. whipplei dig <dig> strain, ranging from twt <dig> to twt <dig>  pcr amplification carried out on the primary isolate of dig <dig> concluded that this evolutionary event did not occur in vitro. as previously reported for the chromosomal inversion seen in the t. whipplei twist and tw08/ <dig> strains  <cit> , this deletion event is associated with flanking wisp membrane protein family coding genes. this fits well with the proposed role of the conserved n-terminal wnd domain in these proteins, with respect to promoting genome recombination  <cit> . the observed deletion probably results from homologous recombination events across such conserved domains. a correlation between the hypermutable regions of the f. tularensis genome and the presence of repeated sequences has been previously reported  <cit> . the majority of deleted genes in the t. whipplei dig <dig> strain encode proteins with unknown function that can be considered as non-essential. dna rearrangements are believed to contribute to the fitness of a pathogen in specific environments. thus, the adaptation of bacterial pathogens from the bartonella and rickettsia genera, to host-restricted vectors such as lice, was associated with accelerated rates of genome degradation  <cit> . interestingly, both major genomic rearrangements, such as the chromosomal inversion among twist and tw08/ <dig> and the  <dig> kb deletion in dig <dig>  are located in the same region which can be considered as the major hot-spot for intra-strain differentiation in t. whipplei.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this work provides the first comprehensive genomic comparison of several isolates of t. whipplei. it reveals that clinical isolates originating from various geographic and biological sources exhibit a high conservation rate, suggesting that t. whipplei rarely interacts with exogenous dna. the frequent variations among members of the wisp membrane protein family is a remarkable trait. the significance of these changes remains to be investigated.
