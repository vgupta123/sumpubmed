BACKGROUND
cysteine proteinases  represent a large group of proteins in plants, with over  <dig> annotated gene sequences identified to date in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . as expected for such a large family, the functions of these proteins are diverse, ranging from involvement in programmed cell death   <cit>  to influencing tissue development  <cit>  and pathogen response signalling  <cit> . during seed development, cysteine proteinases have been found to participate in pcd events associated with embryogenesis  <cit>  and seed coat formation  <cit> , as well as playing a role in the processing of proteins, particularly the seed storage proteins found in protein storage vacuoles  <cit> . different cysteine proteinases are also thought to make a major contribution to the mobilization of the stored seed protein reserves as germination progresses  <cit> . in germinating mung bean seeds, it has been shown that at least two cysteine proteinases are induced soon after germination has started  <cit> , and these authors proposed that vacuolar receptors  transport these newly made proteinases to the protein storage vesicles  thereby enabling them to participate in the mobilization of the seed protein reserves.

in plants, protein hydrolysis via cysteine proteinases is thought to be modulated, at least in part, by a group of proteins called the cysteine proteinase inhibitors. these polypeptides, also called phytocystatins, are a group of plant polypeptides that inhibit c1a and c <dig> type plant cysteine proteinases by acting as pseudosubstrates  <cit> . while it is believed that the key biological function of the plant cysteine proteinase inhibitors  is to modulate the function of target proteinases in-vivo, to date, only a limited number of cpi have been tested with plant cysteine proteinases. in one such study  <cit> , the inhibitory effects of a series of recombinant barley cpi were tested against multiple barley cathepsin l-like cysteine proteinases. these authors showed that most of the barley cpis showed activity against all the cp's tested, although a few cpi did show increased inhibition effects towards one or two specific barley cysteine proteinases. cpis have attracted particular attention due to their capability to inhibit cysteine proteinases found in the digestive tracts of herbivorous insects, an effect that can significantly reduce the destructive effects of these insects  <cit> . for example, urwin et al.  <cit>  showed that over-expression of sunflower or rice cpi polypeptides in potato increased its resistance to globodera root nematodes, and it has been demonstrated that simultaneously over-expressing a cpi with a second protease inhibitor acting on another protease family  allowed tomato plants to have protection for a longer duration from two different tomato pathogens due to a reduced build-up of insect tolerance  <cit> . plant cpis have been also been demonstrated to increase tolerance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in transgenic plants  <cit> .

coffee is one of the most important agricultural commodities traded worldwide, however, there continues to be a lack of fundamental knowledge on many aspects of this crop. to date, for example, there is little information on the proteinase and proteinase inhibitor genes of coffee. as shown above, the cysteine proteinases and their inhibitors play important roles in plant seeds. thus, we decided to begin an investigation of the cp/cpi genes expressed in the semi-recalcitrant coffee grain. in addition, because amino acids and peptides are an important group of coffee flavour/aroma precursors in coffee  <cit> , such a study could also yield some clues regarding the potential role of cp/cpi gene products on coffee quality. in this work, we describe cdna representing several coffee cp and cpi genes, and we present the expression of these genes in developing and germinating grain. to begin studying the functional properties of two highly expressed cp proteins, we have also expressed these proteins in e. coli and tested the recombinant polypeptides for protease activity. the results obtained are discussed in relation to the potential roles of the gene products in the development and germination of the coffee grain.

methods
plant material
robusta samples
the coffea canephora  "maturation" tissues  were harvested in  <dig> from field grown trees , immediately put into liquid nitrogen, then held at -20°c before being sent frozen to tours, france. once at tours, these samples were kept at -80°c until use.

coffee cherries of coffea canephora  used to obtain the "germination" tissues were harvested at mature stage from field grown trees in equator in  <dig>  and sent to tours at room temperature. on arrival, they were manually depulped, washed, and the light grain removed by floating. the remaining grain were dried and the tegument were manually removed. subsequently, the grain were sterilized by a  <dig> h treatment in calcium hypochlorite , followed by three washes using sterile water. the grain were then incubated in vitro on heller medium without added sugar or hormone , at room temperature . then five grain were harvested at various times , and frozen in liquid nitrogen. in the experiment presented, 14dai  corresponds to the first sign of radical emergence.

coffea arabica  leaves were harvested at different stages of development, in  <dig>  from trees grown under greenhouse conditions at tours, france and kept at -80°c before use. two independent sets of leaves were harvested. the development stages of the leaves are defined as follows: very young leaves , young leaves , mature leaves , old leaves . the sizes of the leaves collected were: approximately 2- <dig> cm for vyl stage; 6- <dig> cm for yl stage and 12- <dig> cm for ml and ol stages.

rna preparation
the samples from the various tissues were reduced to a powder in a spex certiprep  <dig> freezer mill with liquid nitrogen and the powders were then stored at -80°c until total rna was extracted. in the case of the coffee cherries at different stages of development, these were first separated into pericarp and grain tissues and then each was very rapidly reduced to a powder and stored as described above. rna were extracted and purified from the stored powders using the rneasy plant mini kit  that included a dnase treatment using the manufacturer's instructions. the quality of the final rna samples obtained were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.

cdna synthesis
the method used to make the cdna was very similar to the protocol described in the transcriptor reverse transcriptase kit  using around  <dig> μg total rna sample and  <dig> ng of oligo dt , with reactions performed at 55°c for  <dig> min. the cdna samples generated were then diluted one hundred fold in sterilized water and aliquots were stored at -20°c for later use in qpcr experiments.

dna sequence analysis
plasmid dna was purified using qiagen kits according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. prepared plasmid dna was then sequenced by the dideoxy termination method  <cit> . computer analyses were performed using the laser gene software package .

real time qrt-pcr experiments
cdna prepared as described above was employed for the quantitative rt-pcr experiments using taqman probes, as described by simkin et al.  <cit> , with an applied  <dig> instrument; except the cdna dilutions and the taqman primers/probes were different. the qrt-pcr primers and taqman probes were designed using primer express® software v <dig>  from applied biosystems and are listed in table  <dig>  below.

all mgb probes were labeled at the 5' end with the fluorescent reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein  and at the 3' end with the quencher dye 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine , except rpl <dig> probe which was labeled at the 5' end with the fluorescent reporter dye vic and at the 3' end with quencher tamra

quantification was carried out by the method of relative quantification, using the constitutively expressed ribosomal protein rpl <dig> as the reference. in order to use the method of relative quantification, it was necessary to show that the amplification efficiency for the different gene sequences were roughly equivalent to the amplification efficiency of the reference sequence  using each specifically defined primer and probe sets. to determine this relative equivalence, plasmid dna containing the appropriate cdna sequences were diluted 1/ <dig>  1/ <dig> , 1/ <dig> , and 1/ <dig> , <dig> fold, and using the qpcr conditions described above, the efficiencies of amplification were calculated. all the primer/probe sets showed acceptable efficiencies.

production of recombinant coffea canephora cccp <dig> and cccp <dig> in e. coli
expression vectors were generated using the "champion™ pet sumo protein expression system" . the cccp <dig> sequence minus its n-terminal  <dig> amino acids was amplified by pcr as follows:  <dig> μl reactions contained the plasmid pa4- <dig>   <dig> μl of takara® dna polymerase 10x la pcr® buffer,  <dig> μm of each cccp <dig> specific primers ,  <dig> μm each dntp, and  <dig>  u of takara dna polymerase . the pcr cycling conditions were as follows: 94°c for  <dig> min; then  <dig> cycles of 94°c  <dig> min, 55°c  <dig>  min, and 72°c  <dig>  min followed by a final step at 72°c  <dig> min. the pcr product was then gel purified. the cccp <dig> sequence minus its n-terminal  <dig> amino acids was produced as described for the cccp <dig> insert except the initial dna substrate was plasmid pcccs46w7n <dig>  and the specific primers were .

the gel purified fragments were then cloned into the ta cloning site of the pet-sumo vector, as recommended by the vector manufacturer. ligated plasmids were transformed into one shot® mach1™-t1r chemically competent cells . clones with the inserts in the correct orientation were selected by pcr screening and the plasmid containing cccp <dig> was named pnm <dig> and the plasmid containing cccp <dig> was named pnm <dig> 

for protein expression, bl <dig> one shot® chemically competent cells  were transformed with pnm <dig> and pnm <dig> plasmids as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol. five ml overnight cultures of the selected transformants were used to inoculate  <dig> ml cultures of lb medium containing  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin  cells). the cells were grown at 37° and  <dig> rpm shaking to an od <dig> of  <dig> - <dig> . then,  <dig> ml was taken and "induced" by addition of iptg . both "induced" and "not induced" cultures were further incubated at 37°c  for  <dig>  h, followed by centrifugation at  <dig> g for  <dig> min at 4°c. cell pellets were resuspended at room temperature in bugbuster® protein extraction reagent ) using  <dig> ml reagent per gram of wet cell paste. then,  <dig> u benzonase nuclease  and  <dig> ku rlysozyme solution  were added per  <dig> ml bugbuster and incubated  <dig> min at  <dig> rpm, at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at  <dig> g for  <dig> min at 4°c.

the pellets obtained from the induced cultures, which contained the inclusion bodies, were again resuspended in bugbuster® solution using the same volume that was used to resuspend the initial cell pellet  and  <dig> ku rlysozyme solution was added per  <dig> ml bugbuster® and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for  <dig> min. then,  <dig> volumes of 1/ <dig> diluted bugbuster® solution was added and the tubes vortexed for  <dig> min. the resulting suspensions were centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the "washed" inclusion bodies collected were resuspended in  <dig> volumes of 1/ <dig> diluted bugbuster® solution and centrifuged as previously. this wash step was repeated three more times to remove non-specific material associated with the inclusion bodies. the final pellets of the purified inclusion bodies  obtained were resuspended in  <dig> volumes of denaturing buffer a  and incubated at 28°c for  <dig> h as described by zhang et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> volumes of buffer b  were then added and purification was carried out with ni-nta superflow columns . briefly, the ni-nta slurry was mixed with the denatured proteins by shaking on a rotary shaker for  <dig> h at  <dig> rpm at room temperature, followed by a loading of the slurry on an empty column and collecting the flow-through. two successive column washes were carried out with  <dig>  volumes buffer b, followed by elution of the recombinant proteins with  <dig>  volumes of buffer c , giving a fraction called el <dig>  this was followed by  <dig> elutions of  <dig>  volumes with buffer d  giving fractions el <dig> and el <dig>   <dig> μl samples of the different fractions were analysed by sds-page gel electrophoresis and those containing recombinant proteins were pooled.

dialysis/refolding method
pooled fractions containing purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed in a similar fashion to that described by zhang et al.  <cit> ; briefly, the purified protein fractions were introduced into slide-a-lyser® dialysis cassettes . then,  <dig> successive dialysis steps were carried out for  <dig> h at 4°c with stirring using buffers containing decreasing levels of urea . the dialysis buffer volumes were approximately  <dig> times higher than the volumes of extracts.

assay for cysteine protease activity
the assay for cysteine protease activity used here is a slight modification of the one developed by zhang et al.  <cit>  and troen et al.  <cit> . protein samples made up to  <dig> μl with water were mixed with  <dig> μl  <dig> mm sodium formate buffer , then incubated  <dig> sec at 37°c for activation, with parallel "non-activated" control reactions set up with samples in which  <dig> μl milliq pure water replaced the  <dig> μl sodium formate buffer. this was immediately followed by the addition of  <dig>  μl of the "reaction mix" . the enzyme reactions were subsequently incubated at 37°c and  <dig> μl aliquots were taken at different times and added to sample loading buffer, heated for  <dig> min at 95°c, then run on sds-page gels and stained with coomassie.

RESULTS
identification of cysteine proteinase sequences expressed during coffee grain maturation
coffee cdna encoding cysteine proteinases were found by carrying out blast searches against the nestlé/boyce thompson institute coffee est database   <cit>  using the protein sequences of two biochemically characterized cysteine proteinases: ntcp56-kdel from nicotiana tabacum  which is a peptidase from the c1a subfamily , and slcp from solanum lycopersicum  which is from the peptidase c <dig> family . this analysis yielded  <dig> candidate unigene sequences . as our main objective was to study genes highly and specifically expressed in the maturing grain, we examined the "in-silico" expression profiles associated with these unigenes. three unigenes  were found that exhibited multiple ests and all were found in either grain or cherry est libraries . further analysis indicated that two of the unigenes  were probably different alleles of the same gene, thus giving only two, clearly different unigenes with high expression in the grain for further study. plasmids potentially containing the longest sequences for each unigene were then selected from our available est libraries and fully sequenced to confirm the "in-silico" unigene sequences.

in the case of unigene sgn-u <dig>  the plasmid pa4- <dig> was selected to characterize the first coffea canephora cp cdna, which we named cccp1; the cdna has a  <dig> bp long insert, with a  <dig> bp coding sequence  encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids. analysis of the protein sequence of cccp <dig>  performed using signalp  <dig>  server  and the "conserved domain database" , shows it is a member of the peptidase_c <dig> superfamily/peptidase_c1a subfamily  and it appears to have at least three distinct domains, a hydrophobic n-terminal signal peptide, followed by a predicted  <dig> amino acid long i <dig> inhibitor propeptide domain n like domain sequence) and a peptidase domain containing the catalytic triad of cys, his, and asn, as well as an active site gln residue. the second coffee cp cdna to be studied in detail has a  <dig> bp long insert encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids which we have called cccp <dig> . the protein sequence indicates that cccp <dig> is also a member of the c <dig> peptidase superfamily  and has the three distinct domains already described for cp <dig>  plus an obvious erfnin like sequence which is located within the  <dig> aa long predicted i <dig> inhibitor domain.

quantitative gene expression analysis for cp <dig> and cp <dig> in different coffee tissues and during grain development/germination
the tissue and development specific expression of the coffee cp <dig> and cp <dig> genes was measured using taqman qrt-pcr. the expression results obtained for robusta variety bp <dig>  indicate that both genes are expressed at increasingly higher levels as grain development progresses from large green grain stage to the mature red stage, with cp <dig> > cp <dig> . few cp <dig> and cp <dig> transcripts were detected in robusta pericarp, leaves, or branch samples, although low levels were clearly detected in the roots . we also examined the expression of cp <dig> and cp <dig> in the germinating and post-germination grain. the material used for this experiment is illustrated in additional file  <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> transcripts are found in germinating/post germination grain , but, in contrast to the developing grain, these genes clearly have different temporal expression patterns during these periods. first, the level of both transcripts rise from t <dig>  to t <dig> . from t <dig> to t <dig> , the levels of cp <dig> transcripts in the grain fell dramatically while the level of cp <dig> transcripts remained high. at t <dig>  which is primarily the first pair of leaves , little or no cp <dig> and cp <dig> transcripts were detected. overall, these expression levels are in agreement with the previous "in-silico" expression data .

cp <dig> and cp <dig> gene expression was also measured in an independent set of robusta samples . the results from this second sample set were globally in agreement with the results presented in figure  <dig>  with a few minor differences. for example, for the second independent set of bp <dig> samples covering grain development, overall cp <dig> expression was lower  and cp <dig> expression was found to be higher at an earlier stage in this second grain sample set. it is likely that some of these transcript level differences result from slight differences in the precise development stages of the various samples. comparison with a second germination sample set  showed that cp <dig> and cp <dig> expression were broadly similar, with the exception that the bp <dig> sample set showed increased cp <dig> transcript levels from t <dig> to t  <dig>  but the frt <dig> samples set shows the levels of cp <dig> transcripts are highest at t <dig> and then fall. nonetheless, for both sample sets, cp <dig> transcripts levels are very low at t <dig>  in both germination sample sets, cp <dig> transcript levels are low at t <dig> and rose to a maximum at t <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> transcripts were barely detected at t <dig> for the second sample set. interestingly, the cp <dig> transcript levels were significantly higher in all the robusta frt <dig> samples examined during pre-germination/germination/post germination  versus the equivalent samples of robusta bp <dig> 

production of recombinant cp <dig> and cp <dig> enzymes in e. coli: purification and activity testing
in order to study the functional properties of the cccp <dig> and cccp <dig> proteins, we expressed these proteins, minus their respective signal peptide sequences, in e.coli as n-terminal his-sumo fusions . the results shown in figure  <dig> indicate that both fusion proteins were expressed at high levels upon induction with iptg and that their molecular weights are close to those predicted. however, subsequent analysis indicated that the vast majority of both the recombinant proteins produced were insoluble . therefore, we used a method similar to that described previously by zhang et al.  <cit>  to denature the fusion proteins and purify them by ni-nta affinity chromatography. the purified proteins were then re-natured as described in the methods. an sds-page analysis of samples from the different purification steps for his-sumo-cp <dig> indicated that a significant level of purification was achieved . similar results were obtained for the his-sumo-cp <dig> recombinant protein.

the purified, soluble fusion proteins were then tested for proteinase activity with a general proteinase assay based on bsa hydrolysis. in this assay, cleavage of the bsa, detected by loss of the bsa band using sds-page, indicates the presence of a proteolytic activity. in the first assays, using the full length purified his-sumo-cp <dig> and his-sumo-cp <dig> after refolding, no activity was detected even after long incubation times. because both coffee proteins are in the same super family as papain, we then decided to examine the possibility that these proteinases could be activated by a short acid treatment. figure  <dig> shows that the his-sumo-cp <dig> proteinase can be activated by a short acid treatment yielding a significant level of protease activity, with the first signs of bsa degradation detected after a  <dig> min reaction time , and with a very pronounced degradation at t =  <dig> min with nearly complete disappearance of the bsa band. no bsa degradation was observed if the his-sumo-cp <dig> polypeptide was not subjected to a low ph treatment. it was assumed that the acid treatment activates cp <dig> via an intrinsic autohydrolysis capability in the cp <dig> pro-peptide, leading to the release of an n-terminal cp inhibitor peptide as has been seen for the tobacco ntcp <dig>  <cit> . to verify that his-sumo-cp <dig> was processed to generate a shortened, active polypeptide, the activation process was followed over time by sds-page analysis. the results obtained showed that recombinant his-sumo-cp <dig> was processed to generate an approximately  <dig>  kda polypeptide that is presumed to be the active cp <dig> proteinase . we confirmed that this "activated" cccp <dig> fell into the cysteine proteinase class of proteases by showing that this activity was inhibited by the cysteine proteinase specific inhibitor e-64c . a similar acid activation and protease test was carried out with purified and renatured cccp <dig>  but was not successful . this result suggests that his-sumo-cp <dig> may not have refolded correctly during the renaturation step. alternatively, it is possible that the polypeptide refolded correctly, but this cysteine proteinase has another mode of activation, such as perhaps requiring the intervention of a specific proteinase to release its putative n-terminal inhibitory domain.

identification of cysteine proteinase inhibitors expressed during grain maturation
to find cdna encoding coffee cysteine proteinase inhibitors, we carried out blast searches using the biochemically characterized helianthus annuus cysteine protease inhibitor hacpi , the dianthus caryophyllus cysteine protease inhibitor dccpin  and a putative cystatin-like inhibitor sequence from citrus × paradisi , as the query sequences. using these criteria,  <dig> distinct unigene sequences were found .  <dig> of these sequences were chosen for further study in this work. plasmids potentially containing a complete orf representing each unigene were isolated from the available est libraries and fully sequenced to confirm the "in-silico" unigenes sequences. the respective gene sequences have been named cccpi- <dig>  cccpi- <dig>  cccpi- <dig>  and cccpi- <dig>  the plasmid names and the size of their inserts are presented in the additional file  <dig> 

quantitative gene expression analysis for cpi- <dig>  cpi- <dig>  cpi- <dig> and cpi- <dig> in different robusta tissues and during grain development/germination
to obtain precise information on the expression profiles of the  <dig> cysteine proteinase inhibitor genes in robusta, qrt-pcr was used to measure their expression levels in a number of tissues and during grain and pericarp maturation, and during germination/post germination. the data obtained is presented in figure  <dig>  cpi- <dig> is expressed at increasingly high levels during robusta grain development . the results obtained in an independent experiment were similar except that this second set of bp <dig> samples showed more constant levels of cpi- <dig> transcripts between the large green and red stages . in both sample sets, few cpi- <dig> transcripts were detected in the robusta pericarp, leaves, and branches, although a low level was seen for one of the red pericarp samples  plus a low level was detected in both root sample sets. . figure  <dig> also shows that cpi- <dig> is expressed during robusta grain germination, starting low at t =  <dig> , then showing roughly similar transcript levels from t =  <dig> to t =  <dig> , followed by a drop in t <dig> : in first pair of young leaves/cotyledons. quite similar expression levels were seen in the second set of samples for robusta grain germination .

both the cpi- <dig> and cpi- <dig> genes were found to be expressed to a small extent in all the tissues examined . a second independent rna set showed a similar expression profile . thus, these two cpi genes do not appear to have any clear tissue specificity. detailed examination of the qrt-pcr results in figure  <dig> show however that some expression differences exist for these two genes, for example there are higher cpi- <dig> transcript levels found at the sg grain stage  and are slightly higher in leaves . one can also observe that cpi- <dig> transcript levels are very low at the t <dig> germination stage . another difference is the relatively high cpi- <dig> expression associated with the mature red coffee pericarp tissue . interestingly, the higher expression of cpi- <dig> is most noticeable in the sample used for figure  <dig>  as this sample could be more mature  than the other "mature" pericarp sample tested, it is entirely possible that increased cpi- <dig> expression is coupled with pericarp age and fruit softening. it will be interesting in the future to explore this possibility further by carrying out more detailed expression studies on this gene at the end of pericarp maturation, and to explore whether cpi- <dig> could also be involved .

the qrt-pcr results in figure  <dig> show that there is little or no expression of cpi- <dig> in the developing grain or in the pericarp at any maturation stage examined . this was also observed with the second robusta sample set studied . however, figure  <dig> shows that significant levels of cpi- <dig> transcripts occur in robusta roots , leaves  and branches . in contrast however, few cpi- <dig> transcripts were detected in the roots and branches of the second robusta sample , suggesting some possible maturity or other tissue sampling related differences could be involved. in the case of leaves, relatively low cpi- <dig> expression was seen in the leaves of the bp <dig> robusta sample set used for figure  <dig>  but very high levels were seen for this gene in the leaves of the bp <dig> robusta sample used for the second sample set . this expression difference, which was hypothesized to be due to leaf maturity, is explored in more detail below. another surprising aspect of the cpi- <dig> expression data obtained is the extremely high level of cpi- <dig> expression detected during the last post-germination stages examined . there was no significant expression of cpi- <dig> from germination stages t <dig> to t <dig> . the same results were seen in the second robusta sample set analysed . this suggests cpi- <dig> could play some important role during this period of plantlet growth/emergence.

quantitative gene expression analysis of the cysteine protease inhibitor genes cpi-1--cpi- <dig> at different stages of leaf development
the very different transcript levels seen for cpi- <dig> in two independent leaf samples from robusta bp <dig> noted earlier suggested that the expression of this gene could be influenced by differences in the developmental stages of the two leaf samples. the idea that cpi- <dig> expression could be significantly induced in some tissues was further strengthened by the fact that very high cpi- <dig> expression was associated with the first cotyledons of the germinated grain. thus, we decided to explore the effect of leaf maturity on the expression of this gene, and the other coffee cpi genes, in leaves of coffea arabica t <dig>  samples corresponding to four different developmental stages were used; very young leaves , young leaves , mature leaves  and old leaves . the expression results presented in figure  <dig> show that cpi- <dig> was very strongly induced as leaves enter their mature phase . cpi- <dig> transcript levels then fell as the leaves aged further. as previously observed in coffea canephora bp <dig> , very low transcript levels are seen for the cpi- <dig> gene in mature leaves, and this is also seen for all the other stages examined in this new experiment . while few transcripts were detected for cpi- <dig> and cpi- <dig> in the two early leaf stages studied here, a slightly variable, but still quite low expression was seen for cpi- <dig> and cpi- <dig> genes in the remaining two leaf stages. this latter result may indicate some slight inducible capability for the cpi- <dig> and cpi- <dig> genes, and thus it will be interesting in the future to re-examine the expression of these two cpi genes in leaf tissues subjected to different stresses .

discussion
cysteine proteases and their inhibitors have been studied in detail for many plants, but, to date, little work has been done on these genes or proteins from coffee. here we describe full length cdna representing two cysteine proteinase genes, called cccp <dig> and cccp <dig>  which show relatively exclusive expression during grain maturation and germination. we also present the characterization of full length cdna representing four cysteine proteinase inhibitor genes  and describe the quantitative expression of these genes in coffee.

sequence comparisons indicated that the two robusta cysteine proteinases described represent different cp proteinases; blast analysis against the protein database indicates that cp <dig> is very closely related to a papain type cp called vscpr <dig> from vicia sativa , as well as a putative cp of arabidopsis . examination of figure 1a shows the protein sequence of cccp <dig> and its putative homologues contain a partial erfnin box  within an n-terminal cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain, indicating that these polypeptides fall within the cp subfamily having an i <dig> domain that is found at the n-terminus of some c <dig> peptidases, like cathepsin l, where it acts as a propeptide. . the i <dig> domain of cccp <dig> and its putative homologues are located just upstream of a clear peptidase c <dig> superfamily domain which have strong homologies with peptidase c1a_cathepsins_b/c/x. several other cp specific elements are also completely conserved in the three highly similar protein sequences presented in figure 1a. the cpr <dig> polypeptide of vicia sativa has been shown to be expressed during seed maturation and during the early part of seedling germination/growth in both the embryonic axis and the cotyledons  <cit> . although the functional activity of this protein has not been proven in a recombinant form, these authors nevertheless implied the processed, and thus presumably activated polypeptide, was involved in seed storage protein mobilization. microarray expression analysis of the potential arabidopsis cp <dig> homologue  indicates this gene has significant expression in developing endosperm and in the embryos of developing and germinating seedlings , supporting the idea that these highly related polypeptides play a role in storage protein modification and/or mobilization. little expression was seen for the arabidopsis gene in other tissues under normal conditions. the expression profile of cccp <dig> transcripts  mirrors the expression of the candidate homologues vscpr <dig> and at3g <dig>  ie, cccp <dig> is expressed in the later stages of grain development and during germination, and implying that cccp <dig> performs a similar function as the putative homologue of the other two plants. to date, it has apparently not been possible to express and/or correctly activate any of the recombinant cccp <dig> homologues in order to confirm their function. the most likely explanation for this inability to verify the activity of these proteins is that the precise conditions needed to process/activate these proteins have not yet been identified.

the alignment of cccp <dig> with two of the closest well characterized plant sequences  indicates that cccp <dig> and its proposed homologues have a clear erfni/vn box within an n-terminal i <dig> type propeptide domain, followed by a peptidase c <dig> superfamily domain containing conserved cysteine proteinase specific sequence elements . all three polypeptides contain n-terminal signal sequences, and the two homologues have a c-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence . interestingly, the cccp <dig> cdna sequence characterized contains the c-terminal sequence kddl. in order to explore whether the kddl sequence was unusual in coffee, we examined the sequences of other cdna in the coffee unigene . this unigene, which is the only clear hit obtained when the coffea canephora unigene set at http://solgenomics.net is blasted with the cccp <dig> protein sequence, has  <dig> ests. analysis of these ests showed that  <dig> have sequence data for the c-terminal end, and, interestingly  <dig> of these end with the kdel sequence. this observation suggests that robusta may have both kddl and kdel alleles of cccp <dig>  a preliminary pcr analysis of genomic fragments from this region of the cccp <dig> gene in coffea eugenoides and coffea arabica suggests that the kdel allele is more prominent in these species . the significance of cp <dig> alleles with a c-terminal kddl sequence is currently unclear. however, the fact that several other plant sequences in the protein database related to cccp <dig> also have c-terminal kdel or rdel sequences  suggests this is the more prominent form found in plants. also, several groups have proposed that unprocessed cp-kdel proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum  after synthesis, and are only processed/transported further upon specific signaling  <cit> , and another group suggested that c-terminal kddl proteins could be poorly retained in the er  <cit> . these observations raise the possibility that an expressed cccp4-kddl protein might be poorly retained in the er and thus could exist in unintended compartments of developing coffee grain cells, with unknown consequences. future experiments comparing physiological or other differences between seeds of robusta trees homozygous for the cccp4-kddl or cccp4-kdel genes could be illuminating.

both the proposed tobacco and tomato cccp <dig> homologues are known to be involved in pollen development. zhang et al.  <cit>  confirmed that the tobacco protein  encoded a functional, acid activated cp proteinase and then went on to show that anti-sense suppression of this gene can disrupt normal pollen development and cause male sterility. the tomato slcysep gene product was also shown to encode an acid activated cp proteinase and to be an important component of the tomato ricinosome, which is a subcellular structure believed to orchestrate the final processing/recycling of cellular proteins during plant programmed cell death  <cit> . in each case, the recombinant cp polypeptides produced in e. coli were insoluble, and, as shown here for the coffee cccp <dig>  needed to be refolded to demonstrate auto-cleavage and cysteine protease activity. analysis of slcysep transcripts showed that they could be detected in flowers at a specific period, and that this expression was primarily limited to the stamens  <cit> . while the expression of ntcp <dig> or slcysep was not studied in seeds, our examination of ests encoding slcysep  confirmed that cdna representing this gene can be found in solanum lycopersicum est banks from fruit, seeds, young leaves, as well as flowers . tomato database analysis indicates the slcysep gene has three introns, and that two other highly related kdel containing "unigene" sequences can be found which potentially represent other members of this specific cp gene family. three potential cccp <dig> homologues were also identified in the arabidopsis genome . examination of the expression patterns for these genes using microarray data  <cit>  showed that at5g <dig> expression was limited to seeds, silique and stamen/anther, although lower levels could also be found in roots, but not in stems, from plants subjected to osmotic stress. interestingly, some induction of at5g <dig> also appeared in nematode infested roots. no significant expression was seen for this gene in other tissues; in contrast, low levels of expression were found for the arabidopsis cccp <dig> like at3g <dig> gene in many tissues, suggesting this gene may play a more general role in plant cells. the only two situations that appeared to increase at3g <dig> transcript levels were treatment with uv and dramatic changes in light conditions . no probe sets were identified for the gene sequence at3g <dig>  so the expression of this gene is not known.

overall, the cccp <dig> expression data presented are consistent with our proposal that cccp <dig> may be involved in the pcd associated with coffee grain germination and post-germination stages. although no significant cccp <dig> expression was detected in the robusta bp <dig> flower sample tested , this may be due to the limited developmental time frame we analysed. new analysis, using several different stages of flower development is clearly needed to clarify the expected participation of cccp <dig> in coffee pollen development. it is interesting to note the vicia sativa proteinase a  was not detected during vetch seed development, but was detected in the cotyledons in the later stages of germination and post-germination   <cit> . these observations, together with the fact that purified vicia sativa proteinase a was capable of completely digesting the vetch storage proteins vicilin and legumin, led the authors to propose that proteinase a was not involved in seed development or in the early part of storage protein mobilization, but was important for later stages of germination which involved much more extensive proteolysis  <cit> . this contrasts with coffee where there appears to be two periods of cccp <dig> expression, one in the developing grain , and another new burst of transcription beginning around the t <dig> stage of germination up to t <dig> stage. we currently do not know the significance of finding low cccp <dig> expression in the developing grain, although we do note that the "absence" of protein a in vicia sativa in developing seeds  <cit>  could be due to the less sensitive detection method used earlier .

the quantitative expression analysis of the four cpi genes  showed that cccpi- <dig> and cccpi- <dig> are expressed in most tissues and that their levels of expression do not vary broadly. in contrast, cpi- <dig> had increasingly higher expression as grain development progresses  and also showed relatively strong expression during the t <dig> to t <dig> stages of grain germination and post germination. little cccpi- <dig> expression was detected in the other tissues tested. for cccpi- <dig>  extremely high levels of transcripts were seen exclusively in the t <dig> and t <dig> stages of post-germination, corresponding to stages in which the cotyledons are forming. the significance of this observation is not known, but one interesting line of future investigation will be to determine whether cpi- <dig> expression contributes to insect tolerance/resistance at this delicate stage of plantlet development. by examining gene expression at different stages of leaf development, we also found that while cccpi- <dig> is weakly expressed in young leaves, its expression increases dramatically in mature leaves . no significant expression of cccpi- <dig> was found for the other tissues tested, except a low level in the roots from robusta bp <dig> cdna set used in figure  <dig> , which raises the interesting possibility that the higher levels of one or more cccpi proteins could reduce damage by root pests like nematodes. overall, the coffee cpi gene expression data suggest that cpi- <dig> and cpi- <dig> could be cp inhibitors with mostly "house-keeping" functions, while cpi- <dig> may play an important role during grain development, and cpi- <dig> could contribute to reducing damage by insects during the early life of the plantlets , and perhaps in mature/old leaves and roots. finally, as the peptide/amino acid profile of a coffee has an important impact on flavour and aroma generation during coffee grain roasting  <cit> , further research is warranted to investigate possible links that may exist between the allelic variation in genes encoding coffee cysteine proteinases and cysteine proteinase inhibitors and the flavour/aroma quality associated with the grain of different coffee varieties.

CONCLUSIONS
several cysteine proteinase and cysteine proteinase inhibitor genes with strong, relatively specific expression during coffee grain maturation and germination are presented. the temporal expression of the cccp <dig> gene suggests it is involved in modifying proteins during late grain maturation and germination. the expression pattern of cccp <dig>  and its close identity with kdel containing cp proteins, implies this proteinase may play a role in protein and/or cell remodelling during late grain germination, and that it is likely to play a strong role in the programmed cell death associated with post-germination of the coffee grain. expression analysis of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor genes suggests that cccpi- <dig> could primarily be involved in modulating the activity of grain cp activity; while cccpi- <dig> may play roles modulating grain cp activity and in the protection of the young coffee seedlings from insects and pathogens. cccpi- <dig> and cccpi- <dig>  having lower and more widespread expression, could be more general "house-keeping" cpi genes. the data generated opens up new avenues to explore the potential contribution of proteinases to coffee quality and facilitates new research to investigate the possibility that coffee cysteine proteinase inhibitors may help reduce damage caused by some plant pests.
