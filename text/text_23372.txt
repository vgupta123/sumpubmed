BACKGROUND
in mammalian cells, the golgi apparatus  is composed of stacks of cisternae
            laterally linked by tubules to create a membrane network, the golgi ribbon, whose
            formation depends on its unique pericentrosomal position  <cit> . microtubules  play an
            important role in maintaining integrity and positioning of the golgi ribbon, which is
            severely altered when mts are depolymerised or when minus-end directed motors are
            inactivated  <cit> . maintaining the architecture of the golgi ribbon also requires continuous
            input of membranes from the er  <cit>  and regulated
            lateral fusion of analogous cisternae  <cit> . recent
            work has begun to identify components necessary for linking cisternal stacks into a
            contiguous golgi ribbon  <cit> . depletion of golgi associated proteins such as golgin <dig> or
            gmap <dig> has been shown to also disrupt formation of the golgi ribbon  <cit> .

gmap <dig> was first identified as a cis-golgi associated protein that redistributed to the
            intermediate compartment  in the presence of brefeldin a 
                <cit> . we and others have shown that gmap210
            co-sedimented with taxol-purified mts  <cit>  and its over-expression profoundly perturbed,
            not only ga structure and function, but also mt-network organisation  <cit> . we further reported that gmap210
            co-precipitated γ-tusc and was able to recruit γtubulin to golgi
            surface in a c-terminus-dependent manner. when targeted to the mitochondria surface,
            gmap <dig> induced their redistribution to a pericentrosomal location  <cit> . in addition, gmap <dig> depletion by sirna
            resulted in extensive fragmentation of the ga. based on these data, we proposed that by
            combining mt-anchoring and membrane fusion activities gmap <dig> contributes to golgi
            ribbon formation around the centrosome  <cit> . we
            also identified a golgi-targeting signal in the n-terminus of gmap <dig>  however, others
            failed to observe golgi localisation of the n-terminus but identified a grip-related
            arf-binding domain  at the c-terminus that interacts with golgi membranes
                <cit> . mutation of a leucine residue predicted
            to be critical for grab-arf binding abolished ga recruitment of the c-terminal domain of
            gmap <dig>  however, the effect of this mutation on the full-length protein localisation
            was not investigated. in addition, interaction with arf <dig> has only been demonstrated
               in vitro  <cit>  and, the
            behaviour of gmap <dig> in response to bfa is not compatible with a simple arf1-dependent
            golgi association. the existence of two golgi-targeting motifs in gmap <dig> sequence has
            been recently confirmed  <cit> .

a bioinformatics search has recently revealed the presence of an alps  motif at the first  <dig> residues of gmap <dig>  <cit> . the alps motif, a lipid-binding module first identified in
            arfgap <dig>  <cit> , is unstructured in solution but
            folds into an α-helix once bound to highly curved membranes. because of this
            behaviour, this motif is considered as a membrane curvature sensor. an analysis of
            attachment properties of gmap <dig> n- or c-termini to liposomes revealed different
            requirements: n-terminus preferably bound to small liposomes whereas the c-terminus was
            recruited to liposomes in an arf1-gtp-dependent, size-independent manner. since arfgap1
            displays curvature-dependent arfgap activity in vitro, it would be
            expected that arf1-gtp is confined to flat membranes where arfgap activity is rather
            low. accordingly, addition of recombinant arf-gap <dig> decreased the association of the
            gmap <dig> c-terminus to small liposomes  <cit> . based
            on these data, and on fluorescence and electron microscopy, a model was proposed in
            which by tethering positively curved membranes via its n-terminus to flat membranes via
            its c-terminus gmap <dig> could serve to capture small transport vesicles in the interface
            er-golgi. other studies have recently reported that arf1-gtp is able to induce positive
            curvature through the insertion of its n-terminal amphipathic helix in the lipid
            bilayer, in a similar manner to the small gtpase sar1p. in this latter model, arf1-gtp
            would be membrane-associated in positive-curvature regions where it could recruit
            effector molecules  <cit> .

the mechanism of membrane binding based on the detection of membrane curvature is likely
            to be relevant to gmap <dig> function. however, the physiological pathway in which it is
            used remains to be characterised. immunolectron microscopy has revealed enrichment of
            gmap <dig> in curved regions of the cis-golgi but has not revealed binding of gmap <dig> to
            any type of vesicles either in mammalian  <cit>  or in drosophila
            cells  <cit> . moreover, depletion of
            gmap <dig> did not affect secretion in both systems  <cit> . on the contrary, overexpression
            of the protein profoundly disturbed golgi structure, and golgi proteins from different
            compartments including gmap <dig> were found in vesicle clusters distributed throughout the
            cell. under these conditions, anterograde and retrograde transport pathways were blocked
                <cit> 
            although this effect could be secondary to the golgi structure perturbation.

recent studies have identified new gmap <dig> partners. those include the small gtpase rab2
            that interacts with dgmap in a coiled-coil region close to the c-terminus  <cit>  and the ciliary assembly protein ift <dig>  rab <dig> is
            localised to the cis-ga and has been found to bind mts and to recruit dynein to
            membranes  <cit> . ift <dig> is one of the
            intraflagellar transport proteins required for the assembly of the primary cilium, and
            the only one that is localised to the ga, in addition to the centrosome and the cilium
                <cit> . gmap <dig> mutant mice are viable until
            birth, when they die from a pleiotrophic phenotype that includes growth retardation and
            lung and heart defects  <cit> . those mice cannot be
            considered knockout mice sensu stricto since they express a truncated
            form of the protein consisting of the first  <dig> amino acids. this polypeptide includes
            the alps motif and therefore the possibility that it could interfere with membrane
            dynamics in vivo should be taken into account. cells from gmap210
            mutant mice were able to form cilia but they were shorter than normal and contained less
            polycystin- <dig> than those detected in control cell lines. in mutant cells the ift20
            protein level is also reduced. whether defects of gmap <dig> mutant mice are due to a role
            of the protein in ciliary assembly through anchoring ift <dig>  as proposed, or to
            additional functions remain to be determined.

finally, cells derived from gmap <dig> mutant mice apparently exhibited a normal golgi.
            this is in marked contrast with our previous results of rnai-mediated inhibition of
            gmap <dig> expression in hela cells  <cit>  and with
            those recently published by the linstedt group: in this study, gmap <dig> was identified in
            a sirna screeening as a component whose knockdown significantly fragmented and dispersed
            the ga  <cit> . depletion of gmap <dig> yielded a
            phenotype in which peri-centrosomal positioning of the ga was disrupted, the golgi
            ribbon was fragmented into ministacks similar to those present in nocodazole-treated
            cells, but secretion exhibited normal kinetics. strikingly, these cells completely
            failed to polarise and migrate in wound-healing assays. a role of gmap <dig> in minus-end
            directed motility of golgi membranes has been proposed.

all available data are consistent with gmap <dig> having at least two membrane targeting
            motifs. however, how these motifs determine the gmap <dig> localisation in vivo
            remain unclear. we have now performed a detailed analysis of golgi binding
            properties of gmap <dig> by generating a battery of truncated and fusion mutants. we have
            analysed their behaviour in non-transformed rpe <dig> cells under several conditions applying
            optical microscopy and video-recording approaches.

RESULTS
the gmap <dig> n-terminal domain is targeted to the cis-golgi and the eres
as previously reported in other cell types, the n-terminal domain of gmap <dig> in
               fusion with gfp  appeared golgi-associated in rpe1
               cells as revealed by double labelling for the cis-golgi protein gm <dig>  or the
               tgn-associated protein golgin <dig> .
               for analysis purposes, we selected cells with comparable low expression levels in all
               our experiments. high resolution images revealed that gfp labelling was not uniform
               and the fusion protein seemed to accumulate at specific sites . fluorescence intensity
               profiles along lines drawn over the golgi area showed the degree of co-localisation
               of each pair of proteins . nter-gfp co-distributed with gm <dig>  but not with golgin <dig>  indicating that
               the n-terminus of gmap <dig> specifically targets the cis-side of the ga. the cis-golgi
               localisation of the nter-gfp protein was preserved after nocodazole-induced
               disruption of the golgi ribbon 
               indicating that targeting of the n-terminal domain to the cis-golgi does not depend
               on golgi ribbon integrity.

to address the dynamics of gmap <dig> n-terminal domain in living cells, we generated a
               dsred fusion protein  and transfected it in an rpe <dig> cell line stably
               expressing the transmembrane domain of galactosyltransferase fused to gfp
               . a spotty distribution of the
               nter-dsred fusion protein at the periphery of golgi elements could be appreciated
               . in addition, it appeared enriched
               in regions that seem to bridge two adjacent elements . note that dsred-tagged n-terminal domain, like
               nter-gfp fusion protein, unevenly distributed on golgi membranes .

since gmap <dig> dimerise  <cit> , we wanted to
               exclude the possibility that golgi binding was due to association with endogenous
               protein. to do this, we transfected the nter-gfp construct in gmap210-silenced rpe1
               cells by sirna. decreasing concentrations of gmap <dig> in rpe <dig> cells fragmented the
               golgi ribbon as in hela cells although elements remained closer to one another.
               figure 1d shows a non-depleted non-transfected
               , a depleted nontransfected  and a depleted transfected  cells. as
               can be seen, the nter-gfp protein was recruited to golgi elements even in the absence
               of endogenous gmap <dig> 

interestingly, some dots scattered throughout the cytoplasm that co-localised with
               sec <dig> were also observed in most cells, indicating that the nter-gfp was also able to
               bind er exit sites . in
               addition, it re-localised to eres upon bfa treatment , a behaviour that is reminiscent of that of the endogenous
               gmap <dig> protein  <cit> . altogether, these data
               demonstrate that gmap <dig> n-terminal domain binds directly to membranes in
                  vivo, specifically targets the cis-golgi and can be recruited to eres
               both in non-treated and in bfa-treated cells.

the n-terminal cis-golgi localisation signal corresponds to the alps
               motif
to define the module responsible for n-terminal domain recruitment to membranes, we
               generated additional truncated forms as shown in figure 2a. the alps-like motif is represented in red and coiled-coil regions in
               light blue. the yellow rectangle corresponds to the continuous coiled-coil domain
               used in the indicated constructs. western blot analysis of all truncated mutants
               revealed bands with apparent sizes matching the predicted sizes .

                     domain of gmap <dig> and all the truncated or fusion constructs in this domain
                     that were tested for their binding to ga  and their migration on sds-page as
                     revealed by western blot with an anti-gfp antibody after expression in rpe1
                     cells . the alps-like motif is represented in red and coiled-coil regions in
                     light blue. the yellow rectangle corresponds to the continuous coiled-coil
                     domain used in the indicated constructs.  subcellular

the 1-253-gfp exhibited identical ga localisation to the whole n-terminal domain
                . a construct containing only the first 76
               amino acids weakly associated with ga  whereas no ga targeting was observed with the complementary mutant
               . finally, the first 38
               amino acids of the protein, corresponding to the alps-like motif, displayed good
               golgi localisation that coincided with gm <dig>  and also decorated some eres . surprisingly, this construct showed a stronger golgi binding
               than the 1-76-gfp one , suggesting the presence
               of inhibitory sequences downstream of the amphipathic helix.
                        golgi membranes.  cells transfected with the
                     alps-cc-gfp construct  were treated  with nocodazole and labelled with
                     anti-gm <dig> and anti-golgin <dig> antibodies. merged images are shown. enlarged
                     views of insets show merged images of gfp and golgin <dig> labellings in left
                     panels, merged images of gm <dig> and golgin <dig> labellings in middle panels and
                     merged images of the three labellings in right panels. at the bottom,
                     fluorescence intensity profiles of lines drawn over golgi membranes revealed
                     cis-golgi localisation of the mutant  but also a striking enrichment in
                     regions from which gm <dig> is excluded and vice versa .
                     bars =  <dig> μm.

we further examined the capacity of the alps-like motif to target another polypeptide
               to ga in vivo, namely a segment of gmap <dig> corresponding to a
               predicted continuous coiled-coil with maximum probability to dimerise , that did not apparently contain any targeting signal and was
               excluded from the nucleus . two
               chimeric constructs, named 1–76cc and alps-cc respectively, were
               expressed in fusion with gfp. addition of the coiled-coil fragment significantly
               improved ga association of the alps sequence  but not that of the 1– <dig> one . quantification of these experiments indicated that the
               affinity for golgi membranes of the alps-cc construct is  <dig>  times higher than of the
               1–76cc fusion protein, which supports the possibility of an inhibitory
               activity of aminoacids 38– <dig> 

strikingly, alps-cc showed a remarkably higher ga specificity than all the other
               constructs including the whole n-terminal domain . the
               construct was exclusively targeted to the ga and, in fact, the distribution pattern
               of alps-cc was very similar to that of the endogenous protein. the most likely
               explanation is that the cc segment mediates the dimerisation of the fusion protein,
               mimicking the structure of the wild-type protein and increasing the avidity of the
               interaction and the selectivity for cis-golgi membranes. to support this view we
               designed an additional construct in which two alps-like motifs were placed in tandem
               separated by a short break. as expected, this significantly increased ga association
               . these results conclusively
               demonstrate that the alps motif is able to bind ga membranes in the absence of any
               other targeting signal.

the remarkable specificity of the alps-cc construct prompted us to analyse more
               closely the membrane-binding properties of this polypeptide. we compared the
               distribution of this chimeric protein with respect to that of gm <dig> and golgin <dig>  in
               control  or nocodazole-treated
                cells. in enlarged views of insets,
               pairs of labellings are as follows: gfp/golgin <dig> labellings in left panels,
               gm130/golgi <dig> labellings in middle panels, triple labellings in right panels.
               fluorescence intensity profiles of lane  <dig> drawn over the golgi area in control cells
               show that the chimeric protein is specifically targeted to the cis-golgi . a careful examination
               revealed, however, that it was unevenly distributed along the cis-side. gfp labelling
               appeared concentrated in regions in which the intensity of gm <dig> labelling was rather
               low. this was even more evident in individual golgi ministacks generated by
               disruption of mts . an inverse
               correlation between gfp and gm <dig> labellings in fluorescence intensity profiles was
               noted .

we conclude that the alps-like motif provides gmap <dig> with a mechanism to
               specifically recognise and bind membranes located at the cis-side of the ga. in
               addition, it is specifically enriched in areas in which other membrane-associated
               proteins such as gm <dig> are not present .

the c-terminal domain binds both cis-ga and centrosome
the binding properties of the gmap <dig> c-terminal domain 
               have also been investigated. contrary to our previous results obtained in
               cold-methanol cos fixed cells  <cit> , pfa-fixed
               rpe <dig> cells displayed a conspicuous gfp-labelling co-localising with gm <dig> and
               endogenous gmap <dig> at the ga ; in
               both methanol and pfa-fixed cells an association with the centrosome was detected
               . association of the
               endogenous protein with the centrosome was not observed, confirming our previous data
               on cos <dig> cells  <cit> . identical results were
               obtained when gfp-cter was transfected in gmap210-silenced cells . strikingly, confocal microscopy using markers
               of the cis-golgi , the
               medial-golgi  or the
               trans-golgi network 
               revealed also a specific recruitment of gfp-cter to the cis face of ga. in marked
               contrast with the n-terminal domain, however, gfp-cter distribution was continuous
               along the ribbon.
                        the centrosome.  rpe <dig> cells were transfected with
                     the c-terminal domain of gmap <dig>  in fusion with gfp,
                     fixed and double labelled for gm <dig> and endogenous gmap <dig>  or for the
                     centrosomal protein ninein and gmap <dig> . merged images are shown in a <dig> and
                     b <dig>  arrows indicate the centrosome.  a merged image of

                     live imaging of a gfp-cter transfected cell treated with bfa. bfa was
                     added to a final concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml at time  <dig>  seconds and
                     images were taken with  <dig> -second intervals. selected frames of movie  <dig>  at
                     indicated time points are shown. note that gfp-cter rapidly dissociated from
                     membranes after bfa addition whereas fluorescence at the centrosome decreased
                     only slightly . bars =  <dig> μm.

when cells expressing the gfp-cter construct were treated with nocodazole,
               centrosomal gfp labelling disappeared  whereas labelling remained on the
               scattered golgi elements . to
               investigate the effects of bfa on gfp-cter membrane association, we employed a
               time-lapse microscopy approach .
               gfp-cter rapidly dissociated from membranes after bfa addition. since bfa is an
               inhibitor of arf-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors which prevents gtp
               loading of arf <dig>  the behaviour of the c-terminal domain supports the possibility that
               gmap <dig> could be an arf <dig> effector . on the contrary, centrosomal labelling
               remained , suggesting that molecular mechanisms mediating the association of
               this domain with ga or centrosome are distinct.

cells were then co-transfected with nter-dsred and gfp-cter constructs and further
               fixed, labelled and analysed by confocal microscopy  or conventional immunofluorescence  followed by
               deconvolution . only cells expressing low levels of both
               constructs were analysed. while both domains specifically target the cis-ga, a clear
               segregation of both constructs within ga was apparent  with the n-terminal domain enriched in areas
               that seem to connect adjacent elements . segregation was also observed with
               respect to giantin  and, more
               interestingly, to endogenous gmap <dig> that remained associated to golgi membranes even
               in the presence of both n- and c-terminal ends . treatment with bfa of double transfected cells confirmed the
               different redistribution of both ends of the protein: the c-terminal domain
               dissociated from membranes, but not from the centrosome, whereas the n-terminal
               domain redistributed to eres .

                     isolated golgi ministacks. bars =  <dig> μm.

to trace the behaviour of gmap <dig> terminal domains we performed time-lapse analysis
               of double transfected rpe <dig> cells . we selected cells expressing
               similar levels of both truncated mutants. strikingly, in a  <dig> min interval of
               observation, the ga of control cells appeared unperturbed and rather static . as noted above, neither separately nor
               simultaneously expressed, the terminal domains displaced the endogenous gmap210
               protein from membranes. the n-terminal domain mostly accumulated between membrane
               elements containing the c-terminal domain and seemed to bridge them in agreement with
               if results . after nocodazole addition, the ga fragmented
               and golgi ministacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm . individual golgi ministacks contained both terminal domains
               but they did not co-localise: the n-terminal domain accumulated at the rims of the
               c-terminal containing cis-cisternae .

taken together, these results suggest that both ends of gmap <dig> contribute to
               determine its localisation inside the ga. to definitively demonstrate this hypothesis
               we generated a new construct consisting of both terminal domains expressed in fusion
               . the distribution of this truncated mutant, which corresponds to the
               full-length protein lacking the long central coiled-coil, was almost identical to
               that of the endogenous gmap <dig> in both control cells  and isolated golgi ministacks induced by nocodazole treatment
               . we
               conclude that the localisation of gmap <dig> is the result of the combined action of
               both n- and c-terminal ends.

both n-terminus or c-terminus are sufficient to target gmap <dig> to the ga
finally, to evaluate the contribution of each membrane-binding domain to golgi
               localisation of gmap <dig>  we generated gfp-fused truncated forms lacking either one or
               both, as represented in figure 6a. western blot
               analysis showed that proteins of expected size were expressed in transfected cells
               . the mutant containing the
               c-terminus but lacking the n-terminus  accumulated at the ga
               as revealed by double labelling for the cis-golgi protein gm <dig>  or the
               tgn-associated protein golgin <dig> .
               fluorescence intensity profiles along lines drawn over the golgi area showed that
               gfp-gmapΔn perfectly co-distributes with gm <dig>  but not with golgin <dig> 
               indicating that the truncated mutant specifically binds the cis-side of the ga
               . in the same way, the
               truncated mutant lacking the c-terminus  mostly localised to
               the ga  although its distribution
               pattern was more complex. similarly to the alps motif, it partially overlapped with
               gm <dig> and did not co-localise with golgin <dig> , indicating that it was also specifically targeted to
               the cis-side of the ga. in addition, the truncated mutant accumulated in some golgi
               regions and in some peripheral spotty structures and tubules that did not contain ga
               markers. finally, the long central coiled-coil domain, divided into two different
               fragments named cc <dig>  and cc <dig> , did not
               apparently associate with any subcellular structure nor contribute to golgi
               localisation in agreement with the behaviour of nter-cter-gfp fusion protein .

discussion
our present data demonstrate that the cis-golgi localisation of gmap <dig> involves two
            distinct membrane binding motifs located at the ends of the protein. although both the
            n-terminal and the c-terminal domains specifically targeted the cis-ga, they did not
            co-localise nor did they with the endogenous protein. in addition, they did not displace
            the endogenous protein from the ga. however, when expressed in fusion as parts of the
            same polypeptide, it exhibited an almost identical localisation to the endogenous
            protein. altogether these data support localisation of gmap <dig> being the result of the
            combined action of the two ends of the protein that recognise different domains of the
            cis-ga.

the n-terminal golgi binding sequence exactly matches the alps motif. this motif that
            has been reported to bind lipids and to act as a curvature sensor in vitro
                <cit>  exhibits a remarkable
            specificity in vivo: it accumulates at discrete regions of the
            cis-cisternae and also associates with some er exit sites. golgi binding significantly
            increased when the alps motif was expressed in a dimeric form either by expression in
            tandem  or by fusion with a non-adjacent coiled-coil segment with
            the highest probability to dimerise including a leucine zipper . the
            striking specificity of the latter construct  indicates that the alps motif of gmap <dig> is able to distinguish specific
            membranes among the bulk of intracellular membranes and, thus, to contribute to
            spatially restricting the protein inside the cell. this also suggests that high
            curvature cannot be the only parameter controlling its recruitment in vivo
                <cit> . the alps motif was originally
            identified in the arfgap <dig> protein and proposed to interact with membranes by inserting
            hydrophobic residues into open spaces between lipid chains caused by the high curvature.
            recently, it has been shown that arfgap <dig> actually contains two alps motifs that
            contribute to golgi targeting  <cit> . from
            amino acid replacement experiments it has been proposed that moderate lipid disorder at
            the target membrane, such as that which may exist at the rims of the cisternae, would be
            enough for alps binding  <cit> . this is compatible
            with the distribution of the gmap <dig> n-terminal domain at the periphery of nz-induced
            golgi ministacks , and also with
            binding to membrane structures that connect golgi stacks. in this regard, we have
            detected the presence of gmap <dig> n-terminus in structures connecting membranes elements
            that contain:  the cis-golgi protein gm <dig>   the c-terminus of gmap <dig> that was
            demonstrated to be evenly distributed throughout the cis-cisternae of golgi stacks,
             the membrane-anchoring signal peptide of the galactosyltransferase that targets
            the gfp to the transmedial region of the ga. these data strongly support the possibility
            that the n-terminus of gmap <dig> binds the connecting structures between golgi stacks.

what is sensed by the alps motif in membranes besides lipid packing defects remains
            unknown, but the fact that it also localises to er exit sites suggests a common feature.
            it has been reported that pre- and early ga compartments share a high content of
            ptdinsp and low levels of cholesterol  <cit> .
            localised ptdinsp formation at eres has also been described, supporting the
            possibility that eres lipid composition resembles that of cis-golgi rather than that of
            bulk er  <cit> . interestingly, gmap210
               drosophila homolog appears associated with both cis-ga and eres
                <cit> .

the full-length gmap <dig> is known to redistribute at eres upon bfa treatment like other
            cis-golgi matrix proteins  <cit> .
            we have observed that all ga-associated alps-containing truncation mutants localised at
            eres, not only upon bfa action but also in control conditions. on the contrary, mutants
            lacking this sequence, such as c-terminus-containing constructs, became cytosolic in the
            presence of bfa. thus, the ability of alps motif to recognise eres might be responsible
            for the redistribution of endogenous gmap <dig> to these structures in response to bfa.
            others have shown that a variety of cis-golgi matrix proteins moved
            directly to eres in the tip of bfa-induced membrane tubules  <cit> . the matrix proteins remained at and around the er exit sites,
            whereas the trailing transmembrane proteins entered the er at these sites and then
            redistribute throughout the er. our finding that gmap <dig> alps motif associates with eres
            in all conditions is the first hint as to how these retrograde membrane tubules could be
            targeted to er membranes.

a second cis-golgi binding signal is present in the c-terminal domain of gmap <dig> 
            binding of the c-terminus to liposomes was recently shown to be dependent on arf1-gtp
            and to involve the grab domain  <cit> . since arf1
            localises throughout the ga stacks  <cit> , specific
            recruitment of the gfp-cter construct to the cis-ga in vivo was
            unexpected and suggests the involvement of additional factors that remain to be
            characterised.

in addition to the cis-ga, the gfp-c-terminal construct was targeted to the centrosome
            in rpe <dig> cells whereas the full-length protein has never been observed at the centrosome
                <cit> . we hypothesised that the behaviour of this truncated mutant reflects its
            affinity for the minus ends of mts. in support of this view, the c-terminal domain was
            able to displace the minus-end binding protein ninein from the centrosome, suggesting a
            competition of both proteins for mt minus ends , as previously reported with
            another centrosomal protein  <cit> . moreover, we
            have found that rpe <dig> cells are unable to form aggresomes at the centrosome even after
            extensive treatment with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig> .

the grab domain was identified on the basis of its homology with the grip domain, an
            arl1-interacting motif present in several coiled-coil proteins associated with the
            trans-ga. interestingly, the subcellular distribution of the grip-containing protein cbs
            in developing drosophila varies during the cell division cycle from ga
            to chromosomes and centrosomes in the mitotic spindle  <cit> . this pattern dramatically changes in the absence of drosophila
            arl <dig> ortholog suggesting that localisation depends on the grip/arl1
            interaction. indeed, a gfp-grip fusion peptide from cbs was addressed to centrosomes and
            mitotic spindle and interfered with centrosome function. we have also observed that the
            c-terminal domain is present in the poles of mitotic spindles .

depletion of gmap <dig> induces fragmentation of the golgi ribbon in isolated stacks that
            lost their pericentrosomal localisation but maintain normal secretion activity. this
            phenotype is reminiscent of that produced by mt depolymerisation and argues against a
            critical role of gmap <dig> in protein transport. instead, it provides support to our
            previous proposal that gmap <dig> participates in golgi ribbon formation around the
            centrosome. depolymerisation of mts is sufficient to generate ministacks indicating that
            golgi ribbon structure normally undergoes dynamic lateral fusion processes depending on
            intact mts. data presented here support a model in which gmap <dig> would participate in
            homotypic fusion of cis-cisternae by anchoring the surface of cisternae via its
            c-terminus and projecting its distal n-terminus to bind the rims or to stabilise tubular
            structures connecting neighbouring cis-cisternae. when fully extended, the long
            coiled-coil central domain of gmap <dig> may achieve a length of approximately  <dig> nm,
            which might favour the tethering between cisternae. as a matter of fact, very short
            treatments with nocodazole , which was not yet producing golgi scattering, induced a
            specific destabilisation of gmap <dig> containing membranes that could correspond to
            mt-dependent intersaccular connections  <cit> . this
            model also agrees, to a large extent, with the molecular model proposed from in
               vitro studies  <cit> , although the alps
            motif in vivo binds curved intra-golgi membranes rather than
            vesicles.

the ability of gmap <dig> to favour homotypic connection between stacks, coupled to its
            capacity to bind mt-minus ends, could provide a rationale to the recently reported
            capacity of gmap <dig> to dock ift <dig> on the ga  <cit> .
            during the transition from the centriole-based centrosome of cycling cells to the basal
            body-based primary cilium of post-mitotic cells, gmap <dig> could re-orient part of the
            tethering and fusion processes from the cis face of the ga toward the basal body,
            mediating the coupling between axoneme assembly and ciliary membrane fusion and growth
            necessary to set the primary cilium as a new cell compartment.

CONCLUSIONS
the golgi localisation of gmap <dig> is the result of the combined action of two distinct
            cis-membrane binding motifs that recognise different domains of the cis-ga. the
            n-terminal golgi binding signal is localised at the first  <dig> residues of the protein
            corresponding to the alps motif, a lipid-binding module that folds into an
            α-helix once bound to curved membranes. it specifically accumulates at the
            periphery of cis-golgi cisternae and in areas connecting adjacent stacks. the c-terminal
            domain, which includes the grab domain, also associates with the cis-cisternae but its
            distribution is continuous along the ribbon. our data support a model in which gmap210
            would participate in homotypic fusion of cis-cisternae by anchoring the surface of
            cisternae via its c-terminus and projecting its distal n-terminus to bind the rims or to
            stabilise tubular structures connecting neighbouring cis-cisternae. in agreement with
            this model, depletion of gmap <dig> induces fragmentation of the golgi ribbon in isolated
            stacks that have lost their pericentrosomal localisation  <cit> .
