BACKGROUND
the argonaute  protein family contains proteins that are highly conserved throughout evolution. these proteins are the core components of the rna-induced silencing complex  that function to silence gene expression in both plants and animals . there are several ago proteins present in different species. for example, eight types of ago proteins in the human and mouse, while  <dig> ago proteins in c. elegans  <cit> . there were four members of the ago family systemically identified in bombyx mori  <cit> . the proteins are termed bmago <dig>  bmago <dig>  bmago <dig>  and bmpiwi. the first two members belong to the ago subfamily, and the latter two proteins are members of the piwi subfamily. the ago proteins bind to small non-coding rnas  to complete the risc complex; the functions of most srnas are mediated through the ago proteins.

srnas are important regulatory molecules in gene silencing and involved in the regulation of many cellular activities. there are three major classes of small rnas: micrornas , small interfering rnas  and piwi-interacting rnas   <cit> . all the three classes of small rnas can be modulated by different mechanisms to generate various products with diverse functions. sirnas are a special type of small rna generated from exogenous dsrnas that act in the process of rna interference. several endogenous double-stranded rna substrates are sources of sirnas, including long hairpin structures  <cit>  and transposable elements  <cit> . the endogenous sirnas could control the activity of the tes and regulate the expression of some genes, and they could also work for viral defense in virus-infected cells .

a te is a dna sequence that can change its position in a genome. tes can be categorized into two classes  according to their replicative and “cut and paste” mechanisms of transposition, and have important roles in maintaining the stability and diversity of organisms through transposition  <cit> . tes were first discovered in plants because of their effects on genome structure and gene function  <cit> . the bombyx mori genome contains more te content than other insect genomes such as that of anopheles gambiae genome   <cit>  and tribolium castaneum genome   <cit> . the te content in b. mori genome was estimated to be  <dig> %  <cit> . thus, approximately half of the genes in the b. mori genome are tes  <cit> . tes can produce small rnas including mirnas, sirnas, and pirnas. a recent study in the silkworm has shown that there are  <dig>  types of bombyx small rnas associated with transposons or repetitive sequences termed repeat-associated small interfering rnas   <cit> . these small rnas may regulate transposon activity forming a genomic defense system against transposons in bombyx mori. another study identified a variety of te-associated sirnas . approximately 60% of these te-sirnas match the antisense strand of bm <dig>  <cit> , which is regarded as an important source for producing small rnas. our group confirmed that bmago <dig> could associate with te-sirnas derived from several tes, including bm <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, we confirmed the te bm <dig> was associated with bmago <dig> and we determined that bm <dig> is the te with the highest abundance of te-derived sirnas associated with bmago <dig>  which further confirms that bm <dig> was a source of small rnas pool. furthermore, we determined the expression profile of the bm1645-associated te-sirnas associated with bmago <dig> in normal and virus-infected bmn cells and silkworms at different developmental stages. our data indicate bm1645-associated te-sirnas can bind to endogenous bmago <dig> in vitro and downregulate the transcription of bm <dig> in the bmn cell line. these results further support that the rnai system can produce short interfering rnas  from bm <dig> to regulate its expression.

RESULTS
sequencing and analysis of bmago2-associated tes and bmago2-associated small rnas
in our previous work, we confirmed that bmago <dig> could associate with te-sirnas derived from several tes  <cit> . to determine if bmago <dig> could associate with tes, we successfully isolated the bmago2-associated rnas from bmn cells by immunoprecipitation  according to the previous method  <cit>   and the >200 nt fraction was size-fractionated for deep sequencing . we identified  <dig> te sequences using tools for te analysis including an online database, bmtedb  <cit> , and ncbi. there were  <dig> bmago2-associated tes in the sequences identified by the high-throughput digital expression spectrum sequencing of bmago2-associated rnas. the types of these tes include line, ltr, sine, non-ltr and tir. we identified  <dig> tes with the abundance  of more than  <dig>  and bm <dig> was the te most associated with bmago <dig> . we obtained similar results for the small rnas mapped. the analysis results are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  thus, bm <dig> was selected for further examination.

bmago <dig> is the bombyx argonaute <dig> protein, which is the mediated protein for both the mirna and the sirna pathways and can bind to mirnas or sirnas . as a bombyx non-ltr retrotransposon, bm <dig> alone contributes to the generation of te-associated small rnas in a very significant way and is regarded as a source of small rna pool  <cit> . the above results suggested that bm <dig> and bm1645-associated small rnas can load onto bmago <dig> with a high abundance. te-associated small rnas may regulate transposon activity forming a genomic defense system against transposons in bombyx mori  <cit> , suggesting that bmago <dig> and bm1645-associated small rnas could be involved in the maintenance of genome stability by suppressing the activity of bm <dig> 

analysis of the expression differences for several te-sirnas in normal and virus-infected silkworm
baculovirus is an important virus for silkworm and it is the pathogen of silkworm nuclear polyhedrosis. virus infection can trigger widespread silencing of host genes by endogenous sirnas  <cit> . we wanted to know if there is a correlation between te-sirnas and the baculovirus infection in bombyx mori. therefore, we performed northern blotting to further test the expression of te-sirnas in normal and ie1-bacmid-piex-1-bmago2-infected bmn cells and silkworms at different developmental stages. we chose  <dig> bmago2-associated te-sirnas derived from bm <dig> according to the previous analysis and then synthesized probes. u <dig> was used as the control. in normal and virus-infected bmn cells, we detected the following te-sirnas by northern blotting: te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig> and te-sirna <dig>  we found there were obvious differences in the expression of te-sirna <dig> and te-sirna <dig> between the normal and virus-infected bmn cells . unexpectedly, a set of sine-derived endo-sirnas was also found in a variety of sequencing data and mhv68-infected cells in mouse  <cit> . sindbis virus  could also induce the production of another class of mrna-derived endo-sirnas in aedes aegypti  <cit> . this finding suggests there is a correlation between these te-sirnas and the baculovirus infection in bombyx mori. the activation of antiviral rnai in silkworm might be accompanied by these endogenous te-sirnas. the specific functions require further research.fig.  <dig> identification of te-sirnas by northern blotting in bmn cells and each phase of the silkworm. a identification of te-sirnas by northern blotting in bmn cells. n: normal bmn cells, v: bmnpv-infected bmn cells. there were  <dig> of  <dig> te-sirnas detected in bmn cells. the detected te-sirnas were te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig> and te-sirna <dig>  we used u <dig> as the control. there were obvious differences of the expression of te-sirna <dig> and te-sirna <dig> between the normal and virus-infected bmn cells. b expression profile of te-sirnas in each phase of the silkworm by northern blotting. n: normal samples, v: bmnpv-infected samples. only te-sirna <dig> could be detected in all four developmental stages of the bombyx mori. the others were expressed in one, two, or three different stages




the expression of the te-sirnas was different during different developmental stages of the virus-infected silkworms compared to the normal individuals. figure 1b shows that only te-sirna <dig> was detected in all four developmental stages of bombyx mori. the other te-sirnas were expressed in one, two, or three different stages. the te-sirnas were selectively expressed in different developmental stages. the results suggest the te-sirnas identified do not exist during the entire life stages of the mulberry silkworm. we found te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  and te-sirna <dig> were expressed in most of the life stages. furthermore, te-sirna <dig>  and te-sirna <dig> were detected only in moths, and te-sirna <dig> was detected only in eggs. there were several te-sirnas identified whose expression was affected by the virus, including te-sirna <dig> and te-sirna <dig>  however, the expression of most te-sirnas remained relatively constant between normal and virus-infected silkworm.

te-sirnas combine with activated bmago <dig> in vitro
we performed emsa  to further identify the interaction between te-sirnas and bmago <dig>  this assay is often used to detect interaction between dna/rna and proteins  <cit> . the emsa technique is based on the principle that the rate of nucleic acid migration is slowed when bound to protein.

we chose  <dig> te-sirnas from the pool used in the previous experiment that were reverse complements of bm <dig> and in relatively high abundance . the results suggested that  <dig> of the  <dig> te-sirnas were identified to associate with bmago <dig>  the associated te-sirnas were te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  and te-sirna <dig>  these bmago2-associated te-sirnas migrate more slowly than the corresponding free te-sirnas . conversely, te-sirna <dig> and te-sirna <dig> were not identified to associate with bmago <dig> in vitro, implying there might be another factor that affect the association between the two te-sirnas and bmago <dig> in vivo. the experiment in vitro simulated the combination of the te-sirnas and bmago <dig>  this result reveals that the small rnas generated by bm <dig>  associate with activated bmago <dig>  and suggests that bm <dig> te-sirnas might act to regulate bm <dig> expression in vivo.fig.  <dig> the mapping pattern of bm <dig> and  <dig> bm1645-derived small rnas. these  <dig> te-sirnas are reversely complementary to bm <dig> and show relatively high abundance. we chose these as our targets for subsequent experiments. the mapping figure was generated using the tablet software


fig.  <dig> te-sirnas combine with activated bmago <dig> in vitro. we used the control ire/irp system included in the kit as one positive control and the ire/bmago <dig> and te-sirnas without proteins as the negative control. the shift of the positive control was a thick stripe. we detected  <dig> te-sirnas, and there were  <dig> detected with block stripes. the shifted te-sirnas were te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  te-sirna <dig>  and te-sirna <dig>  on the contrary, te-sirna <dig> and te-sirna <dig> were not associated with bmago2




te-sirnas downregulate the expression of bm <dig> in vitro
we chose the  <dig> te-sirnas that associated with bmago <dig> in the emsas to use for the dual-luciferase reporter assays and qrt-pcr experiments with bmn cells. the results showed the  <dig> te-sirnas significantly inhibited the expression of the luciferase fused with the wild-type region containing te-sirna targeted sites in bm <dig> but did not affect the activity of luciferase fused with the mutant sequences . these results suggest that te-sirnas target the targeted sites in bm <dig> to suppress the gene’s expression. furthermore, the transcription of bm <dig> was downregulated in bmn cells transfected with te-sirnas compared with the negative control . when the expression of bmago <dig> was downregulated by rna interference, the transcriptional level of bm <dig> was upregulated  <dig>  times, as assessed by qrt-pcr . these results suggest that there is a relationship between bmago <dig> and bm <dig> in bmn cells and the bridge might be the small rnas. bmn is a bombyx ovary cell line. in many reports, endo-sirnas are always involved in the germline development . the regulatory function by te-sirnas in bmn cells suggests a relationship between these sirnas and germline in silkworm.fig.  <dig> validation of te-sirna targeted sites using dual-luciferase assays. the expression of the firefly luciferase fused with the wild-type sequences containing te-sirna targeted sites in bm <dig> was inhibited by the corresponding te-sirnas. but te-sirnas did not affect the activity of luciferase fused with the mutant sequences

there are three types of small rnas and researchers have searched for transposable elements that bind these small rnas. previous studies found that pirnas repressed tes in the animal germ line  <cit> . there are differences between pirnas and mirnas/sirnas; pirnas bind to the piwi class of argonaute proteins, however, mirnas/sirnas bind to the ago class of argonaute proteins  <cit> . one study  <cit>  expanded the scope of investigated species  <cit>  from two strains of d. melanogaster to  <dig> strains and discovered there was novel pirna production at novel te loci. these findings were consistent with data reported in previous studies  <cit> . another report found a relationship between pirnas and tes  <cit> . the report suggested the movement of tes was repressed by pirnas in the gonadal cells of drosophila. one of the inhibition mechanisms was through the formation of heterochromatin and then contact with repressed gene expression  <cit> . a recent study has found there is another method used to repress tes, which is endo-sirna inhibition  <cit> . in addition to insects, there were related reports in plants describing the relationship between small rnas and tes  <cit> . although there have been many discoveries involving tes and pirnas, there is less relevant research with sirnas and tes in insects, such as the silkworm. rna interference is a useful tool for the downregulation of target gene expression  <cit> . there is insufficient information describing other roles for sirnas except for those known in insects. thus, plants are commonly used to study tes with sirnas. plants produce 24-nt small interfering rnas that are mainly derived from repeats and tes. for example, rice uses dicer-like  <dig> to produce te-associated 24-nt sirnas to control agricultural traits  <cit> . there are a limited number of studies about tes and sirnas in bombyx mori. based on our previous research  <cit> , we systematically identified and analyzed the tes associated with bmago <dig> that had an abundance value  exceeding  <dig>  we also analyzed their mapped small rnas associated with bmago <dig>  we found that bm <dig> was the most abundant bmago2-associated te, and the abundance of its mapped small rnas was also the most. these results matched with our previous study  <cit> . we chose bm <dig> and its sirnas as our targets and identified their interactions. our results showed te -sirnas could associate with activated bmago <dig> in vitro. this finding suggested bm <dig> could produce sirnas that were also associated with bmago <dig> in vivo. we hypothesize that bm <dig> might regulate its own expression with the help of the sirnas. we also validated the targeted sites of te-sirnas in bm <dig> and found the upregulation of both the sirnas and bmago <dig> influenced the relative expression of bm <dig>  the results confirm our hypothesis, suggesting there is a bridge between bmago <dig> and bm <dig> which might be the sirnas. bm <dig> is a bmago2-associated te that possibly plays an important role in cell growth. it is also regarded as a small rna pool  <cit>  and may serve as a sirnas source acting to silence its own activity. bmago <dig> could combine with bm <dig> to promote the function of tes in gene regulation by te-sirnas. in bombyx mori, there may be a second way to inhibit tes activity with the help of the sirnas in addition to the pirna pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
we found bm <dig> was the most abundant bmago2-associated te, and bm1645-derived small rnas was also the most abundant bmago2-associated small rnas, suggesting bm <dig> was a source of small rnas pool. we determined that several bm1645-derived small rnas showed differential expression in normal and bmnpv-infected bmn cells and silkworms from various developmental stages. furthermore, we found four te-sirnas from bm <dig> could bind to endogenous bmago <dig> and downregulate the expression of bm <dig> in bmn cells, suggesting bm <dig> may serve as a sirnas source acting to regulate its own expression.
