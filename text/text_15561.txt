BACKGROUND
feline immunodefiency viruses  naturally infect cat species in the wild and are related to other lentiviruses known to infect primates , sheep and goats , horse , and cattle . fiv is endemic in felidae species  <cit> , many of which are considered endangered or threatened with extinction  <cit> . a recent comprehensive survey of serum and lymphocyte specimens from  <dig> individuals affirm that at least  <dig> free-ranging and, if captive animals are included, as many as  <dig> species of cat are infected with fiv  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of the pol-rt region sequenced from six of these felid species, plus spotted hyaena, crocuta crocuta, affirm the high level of species-specificity worldwide  <cit> . each species specific fiv forms a distinct monophyletic lineage, separated by substantial genetic divergence that suggests virus-host adaptation and rare episodes of interspecies transmission in the wild  <cit> .

the effects of fiv infection and disease are well described in domestic cat  but less so in exotic felids. fivfca infection in domestic cat is analogous to hiv infection of humans causing early flu-like symptoms, followed by severe weight loss, chronic wasting disease, and increased susceptibility to rare cancers and opportunistic disease, neurologic disease and death  <cit> . captive and wild populations of two species, the african lion  infected with fivple and the puma , infected with fivpco exhibit less severe disease associations. however, infected lions show a dramatic decline in cd4+ subsets, a reduction of the cd4+/cd8+ ratio, reduction of cd8+βhigh cells, and expansion of the cd8+βlow subset relative to uninfected lions  <cit> . further, fivpco infected puma display a more generalized response of lymphopenia expressed as a significant decline in total lymphocytes, cd5+ t-cells, and cd5- lymphocytes as well as a significant reduction in cd4+ t-cells  <cit> . like lions, seropositive pumas have a significant decline in cd8+βhigh cells but differ by not showing compensatory expansion of cd8+βlow cells relative to controls  <cit> . the results observed with fiv-infected lion and puma parallels human  and asian monkey  cd4+ diminution, and suggests there may be an immunological cost of fiv infection in these two species of large cats.

identification of genetic correlates of fiv virulence, infectivity, and pathogenicity in different cat species is limited due to a paucity of complete genome sequence. only subtypes a, b and c from domestic cat fivfca  <cit> , subtypes a and b from puma fivpco <cit>  and a single strain  from pallas cat   <cit>  have been sequenced in entirety. here we present full-length provirus sequenced from fivple subtype b isolated from lions in the serengeti national park in tanzania and fivple subtype e from lions dwelling in the okavango delta in botswana. these two fivple subtypes exhibit a range in sequence divergence throughout the genome, share motifs unique to this lion-specific lentivirus, yet also exhibit unusual and significant differences in the env gene.

RESULTS
genomic organization and sequence divergence of fivple subtypes
fivple subtypes b  and e  share a similar genome organization with other fiv which consists of ltr, gag, pol, vif, orfa, env, and additional small orfs that may represent accessory genes including rev . the total proviral genome size was conserved between fivple subtype b  and subtype e  . fivple gag encodes three putative structural proteins of matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid. pol is conserved and encodes key viral enzymes of protease, reverse transcriptase, rnaase, dutpase and integrase. fivple vif, an accessory protein essential for viral replication, resembles that of fivfca. orfa in fivple is similar to fivfca and likely corresponds to hiv tat, which targets transcription factors in the ltr. fivple env encodes the putative leader, surface , and transmembrane  regions of the envelope glycoprotein, essential components for viral binding to and entry into the host cell. fivple rev is similar to hiv/fiv rev, and is thought to be critical in viral replication. fivple rev appears to be encoded by splicing two exons: the first in the leader region of env, the second located near the 3' region adjacent to env .

the ltr of fivple contains transcription and regulatory elements common to other fiv. these include the direct  <dig> bp repeat  defining the 5' and 3' termini of ltr, ap- <dig>  aml- <dig> , ap- <dig>  tata box, poly a, and the cap transcription initiation site . fivple subtypes have additional transcription factors characteristic of fiv, but placed in alternate locations within the ltr u <dig> including nf-at and crebp-1/c-jun. these and other motifs were determined by homology search with a threshold value of 85% with the motif search database  <cit>  . overall, lion ltrs are not identical between subtypes b and e, differing by 15% in nucleotide substitutions, comparable to that observed between fivfca subtypes a, b and c .

deep genetic divergence between fiv strains from different cat species made alignments problematic. for coding regions, we first translated each gene into amino acid residues, which are less divergent as changes occur at a lower rate of substitution, to serve as a "scaffold" for alignment of nucleotides using the program revtrans  <cit> . our results indicate that pol  is the most conserved gene across fiv, albeit exhibiting substantial average pair-wise genetic distances of 60% and 54% for nucleotide and amino acid data, respectively . gag sequences  differed by an average pairwise genetic distance of  <dig> % for nucleotides, a  <dig> % amino acids . however, vif , orfa , and env  were highly divergent. for these genes, sufficient homology existed to both identify the gene, and to create a multiple sequence alignment across all fiv yet, phylogenetic models for patterns of substitution at variable sites were saturated resulting in an average genetic distance of 100% for both nucleotide and amino acid data . such differences in rates of evolution between viral genes corroborate previous findings describing functional constraints for gag and pol  <cit> , while also demonstrating that vif, orfa, and env rapidly evolve in each host species.

* 100% genetic distance means sufficient homology present to create alignment, but no meaningful phylogenetic associations are detected.

phylogenetic analyses of fivple subtypes
the evolution of fivple subtypes is defined by separate phylogenetic analyses of each viral gene as well as combined data of concatenated sequences representing the entire coding region of fiv. ltr, gag, pol, vif and orfa affirm the species-specificity of fiv both in individual gene analyses  and in the combined concatenated data phylogeny excluding env . the three subtypes of fivfca from the domestic cat exhibit the least amount of genetic divergence within each viral gene phylogeny. sharing a monophyletic lineage with distantly related fivoma, the fivple subtypes b and e have intermediate levels of genetic distance with each viral gene examined. subtypes a and b of fivpco are the most divergent and have substantial differences across the viral genome. thus, the hierarchical pattern of genetic divergence among full-length genomic analyses of fivfca, fivple and fivpco recapitulates earlier evolutionary studies based on portions of pol-rt and gag  <cit> .

the relative differences in genetic diversity among fiv strains may be correlated with the amount of time since the virus entered modern felids and therefore, can be interpreted in the context of the evolutionary and phylogeographic history of each host species. the domestic cat evolved as a unique felid lineage only around  <dig>  year ago  <cit>  from subspecies of wildcat felis silvestris inhabiting near east asia  <cit> . preliminary results from limited seroprevalence studies, indicate that fiv appears to be absent from nearly all of the close relatives of domestic cat [ and the new world jaguarundi  and arose approximately  <dig>  mya  <cit> . the extreme divergence between subtypes a and b within the fivpco lineage suggests an ancient origin of fiv infection of puma, a result consistent with the published pol-rt phylogeny marked by high levels of intra-subtype divergence of fivpco subtypes from throughout the host species range  <cit> . lastly, the african lion species arose approximately  <dig> mya and spread throughout africa, asia and the americas  <cit> . however, due to episodes of population reduction followed by expansion from east africa and recolonization, genomic diversity in modern lion populations coalesces to approximately  <dig>  years ago and is confined the african continent  <cit> . fivoma is found in wild populations of the eurasian pallas cat  <cit> , a species that arose during the late pleistocene  <cit> . the monophyletic lineage of pallas cat fivoma and african lion fivple observed here suggest more ancient inter-species transmission as the last time lions and pallas cats were in geographic contact was during the pleistocene when lion ranges spread throughout asia, providing a possible opportunity for fiv transmission between these species  <cit> .

discordant env phylogeny between fivple subtypes reveals ancestral fiv recombination events in the wild
the patterns of phylogenetic divergence between fiv strains from different cat species are concordant between all viral gene regions with one notable exception, the env gene. phylogenetic analyses of the entire concatenated coding region  and separate analysis of the env gene  show the two fivple subtypes are no longer monophyletic . a closer examination of the env gene shows only two shared regions of homology between fivple subtypes. the first spans the sites 1– <dig> of env, containing exon  <dig> of rev , within the leader region exhibiting 80% nucleotide and 68% amino acid homology between fivple subtypes. the second region occurs at the terminal 3' region of env  with 87% and 71% genetic identity for nucleotides and amino acid, respectively. based on comparison with fivfca, this region of fivple may be the rev responsive element , which is critical for targeting rev to the nucleolus of the cell  <cit> . as rev is conserved between lion subtypes, it is likely that rre must remain conserved as well.

by contrast, the su and tm regions of env differ substantially between fivple subtypes . a contiguous region of env, from amino acid sites  <dig> through  <dig> , shows that fivple subtype e is more similar to fivfca than to fivple subtype b. further, env of fivple subtype b, concordant with results from other gene trees , shares more homology with fivoma . moreover, the lack of monophyly between fivple subtype b and fivoma  is a consequence of the recombinant env of fivple subtype e, as exclusion of this subtype from the analyses  recovered the monophyletic relationship observed with other genome regions .

the predicted env protein from both fivple strains were compared to other published fiv strains with respect to inferred structural elements, with particular focus on regions known to be important for receptor binding. conserved  and variable regions  and epitope binding sites  were identified based on their locations in the domestic cat fiv sequences  <cit> . the v3-v <dig> regions shared least homology between the two strains. in fivfca, this region has been shown to contain the cxcr <dig> binding site  <cit> , neutralizing antibody binding sites  <cit>  and several epitopes important for cell tropism and cell line adaptation  <cit> . within the v3-v <dig> region, several biochemical differences have been noted between domestic and non-domestic cat lentiviruses  <cit> . fivple subtype b demonstrated properties more similar to other non-domestic cat lentiviruses including a negative charge and fewer cysteine residues within this region. conversely, fivple subtype e had a positive charge and more cysteines in v3-v <dig>  more similar to the domestic cat lentiviruses. both lion fivs had similar numbers of predicted n-glycosylation sites  and these numbers are intermediate to the domestic cat fivs  and the other non-domestic fivs . a similar trend of lower charge and more cysteine residues in b than e was noted in v <dig>  the region implicated as receptor binding domain for fiv  <cit> . in contrast, the more conserved regions flanking v3-v <dig> were more positively charged in fivple subtype b than in fivple subtype e, but contained similar numbers of cysteine residues and putative n-glycosylation sites. such differences suggest that substantial divergence may occur in secondary and tertiary structures at the receptor-binding region of these two lion lentiviruses.

recombination in lentiviruses is not uncommon. in the ongoing global hiv pandemic, at least  <dig> circulating recombinant forms from hiv- <dig> subtypes have been so far described in patients world-wide  <cit> . siv full genome sequence comparisons increasingly depict extant primate lentiviruses with mosaic structures indicative of multiple recombination events over time  <cit> . in fivfca, recombination in the v3-v <dig> region of env was detected between subtypes a and b in feral cats  <cit> , and different recombination frequencies occur between large regions of fivpco subtype b in domestic cat experimentally infected with fivpco b  <cit> . whereas the frequency of fivple recombination is not yet known, our studies show that over 40% of serengeti lions in tanzania are multiply infected with fivple subtypes a, b and c, which circulate freely within this large population  <cit>  and thus offer opportunities for recombination.

the recombination of env in fiv infected lions has interesting evolutionary significance because the divergence in this region is extensive between the two subtypes. therefore, subtype e recombination may represent an ancient event of recombination followed by a long period of divergence, or a more recent recombination with a highly divergent but as yet unsequenced strain either from lions or another african felid species. although fivple subtype e env is more similar to fivfca than to any other known fiv the extent of genetic divergence is still quite substantial, i.e.  <dig> % nucleotide relative to fivfca subtype c , suggesting that if recombination has occurred recently, it is likely to have been with strain that has not yet been sequenced for the env gene. this recombination event may also have functional implications, as fivple subtype e env has structural features more similar to pathogenic fivfca. further investigation into complete genome analyses of fivple subtypes a, c, d and f as well as fiv from other seropositive african felids, will likely provide new insights into the role of recombination in env in the wild. clinical studies will help to clarify the significance of these recombination events.

CONCLUSIONS
ongoing efforts to sequence full genome fiv from all seropositive exotic cat species will be essential to understanding the evolutionary trajectory of these viruses including the origin and frequency of recombination within fiv. this study demonstrates the necessity of whole-genome analysis to compliment population/gene-based studies, which are of limited utility in uncovering complex events such as recombination that may lead to functional differences in virulence and pathogenicity. the changes observed in the env gene as a consequence of recombination in fivple will provide important clues to the natural history of these viruses and their hosts, and may lead to insights into genetic determinants of pathogenicity and virulence differences between domestic cat and lion fiv; findings with important implications for hiv pathogenesis in humans and virus attenuation in wild populations of endangered species.
