BACKGROUND
epstein-barr virus  primary infection usually occurs early in childhood until teens, and then persists through-out life as latent infection in a fraction of b-lymphocytes in more than 90% of adults. one adverse consequence of the infection is an increased tumour risk  <cit> . there are some  <dig>  new ebv-positive tumours occurring annually in the global human population, of which half derive from the hematopoietic compartment and half from epithelial precursors. the tumour risk is thought to be intrinsic to the viral strategy for survival and spread. indeed, the ability of the virus to transiently induce proliferation of latently infected b-lymphocytes results in an increased pool of infected cells. this induction of proliferation depends on the switch between viral latent programs in the cell, which can bring the cell from resting state, into active cell cycle and back to resting. if this switch gets out of balance, more proliferation leads to a higher load of virus-infected cells and hypothetically increases the risk for lymphoma development. the mechanisms controlling induction of proliferation are not understood. the most upstream event that can be identified until now is the switch between two viral promoters, the q promoter  and the c promoter , which in turn determines expression of key regulatory viral proteins. here we present an in silico study of this viral switch, involving one viral and one human protein. the aim is to investigate whether this simplified model can explain the availabel experimental data, as well as opening the field of ebv research to modeling.

the ebv genome is a  <dig> kbp long double-stranded dna which during latent infections is maintained in the nucleus of the host cells as an extra-chromosomal circular episome. twelve viral genes can be expressed in different combinations during latent viral infection, while the remaining  <dig> major open reading frames are expressed during the replicative, lytic cycle  <cit> . during latency ebv genes are expressed in four programs, denoted latency  <dig>  i, ii and iii. in latency iii all  <dig> latency genes are expressed, including six nuclear proteins, ebna-1- <dig>  three membrane proteins , bart and two small non-translated rnas . in latency ii, the viral genes for ebna- <dig>  the three membrane proteins and the ebers are expressed while in latency state 0/i, only lmp2a and variably ebna- <dig> are expressed  <cit> . b-lymphocytes in latency iii are proliferating, driven by the viral gene products, while the remaining latency forms are in non-proliferating, resting cells. an essential viral protein is ebna-1; responsible for viral replication, episome partitioning as well as functioning as regulator of gene transcription  <cit> . ebna- <dig> is therefore expressed in all latent programs, but the mrna transcripts results from different promoters; cp in latency iii and qp in latency i  <cit> . it is believed that the two promoters are mutually exclusive due to different ebna- <dig> levels between the latency programs  <cit> .

the cp transcripts produce all six ebna-proteins from bicistronic mrnas modulated by alternative splicing  <cit> . its activity is directed by several regulatory sequences of which the enhancer 'family of repeats'  region is the major regulatory site. fr consists of multiple ebna- <dig> and octamer binding sites, in an alternating pattern  <cit> , and ebna- <dig> binding to fr is required for transcriptional activation  <cit> . the enhancement of cp by ebna- <dig> bound at fr follows a complicated pattern, where at least eight of the  <dig> present sites need to be occupied by ebna- <dig> for full transcriptional activation  <cit> . the human transcription factors oct- <dig> and oct- <dig> in association with bob. <dig>  have been shown to activate cp, while oct- <dig> in association with members of the groucho  – family of proteins acts as an inhibitor of cp  <cit> . oct- <dig> is however not the prime candidate for operating the switch since it is not b-cell specific, like oct- <dig>  and moreover there is little or no difference in oct- <dig> levels between latency i and iii cells . oct- <dig> levels, on the contrary, differ between latency i and iii , indicating that oct- <dig> is the dynamic inhibitory protein, even though it requires to bind fr in complex with grg/tle to be inhibitory  <cit> .

between fr and the initiation site there are other regulatory sequences such as an ebna-2-dependent enhancer  <cit> , gre, a glucocorticoid-responsive enhancer  <cit> , and sites for egr, sp <dig> and nf-y transcription factors  <cit> . deletion analysis however indicated that the gre is not necessary for transcription initiation, and the ebna- <dig> dependent enhancer is not sufficient to activate cp  <cit> .

moreover, sp <dig> and nf-y are two ubiquitously expressed proteins known to interact with each other  <cit> , and nf-y is suggested to play a role in basal transcriptional regulation  <cit> , with binding sites in 30% of all eukaryotic promoters  <cit> . taken together, these experimental data indicate that ebna- <dig> is the major activator of the c promoter.

in contrast to cp, qp governs expression of a monocistronic ebna- <dig> transcript and is thought to be a housekeeping promoter of latency i since it lacks tata sequence upstream of the initiation site, like many cellular housekeeping genes  <cit> . experimental studies of qp regulation have revealed three types of transcription factors binding in the promoter region; ebna- <dig>  e2f and irf. irf factors have been shown to constituitively activate qp, with the role of directing general transcription factors in the absence of a tata box  <cit> . the information concerning e2f regulation is less consistent, since e2f has been shown to both activate and inhibit qp  <cit> . there is however no doubt that qp is negatively auto-regulated through binding of ebna- <dig> to the two binding sites downstream of the initiation site  <cit> , and that one occupied site is enough to block qp activity  <cit> .

transcriptional control of genes is not trivial to model, especially not for eukaryotic systems with complex regulatory machinery. however, a main dynamic regulatory mechanism is the binding of inhibitory or stimulatory transcription factors to operator sites on the dna. assuming that the rates for binding and unbinding of transcription factors are much faster than the rates for open complex formation and elongation, these bindings are in homeostatic equilibrium with the instantaneous transcription factor concentrations  <cit> . this is the basis for modelling gene transcription probabilities with thermodynamic models, as has successfully been used to describe genetic switches in coliphage systems  <cit> .

in this paper we construct a physico-chemical model of the switch between ebv latency i and latency iii. the model is based on the hypothesis that promoter control by ebna- <dig> and oct- <dig> is sufficient to switch between cp and qp usage in the two latency programs. even though this is a simplification, the experimental data summarized above point to ebna- <dig> as the major regulatory factor in controlling both promoter activities, and to oct- <dig> in complex with grg/tle as a candidate for inhibitory control of cp. in our model, cp is thus switched on by ebna- <dig> and switched off by oct-2+grg/tle, while qp is switched off by ebna- <dig> and is otherwise on. figure  <dig> gives a schematic overview of the model.

while this system belongs to the same general class of systems studied previously, a distinguishing feature of our system is the relatively large number of number of binding sites, and the complicated observed dependence of activation on the number of ebna- <dig> bound. this theoretical approach to understand ebv-induced cell proliferation is to be seen as an extension of experimental studies and a first step towards a system level description of ebv infections.

RESULTS
the two states latency i and latency iii can be studied in human ebv-positive b-cell lines either derived from tumors or transformed in vitro by the virus. cells in latency i without exception show lower levels of ebna- <dig> and higher levels of oct- <dig> compared cells in latency iii . an example of a qualitative comparison of ebna- <dig> and oct- <dig>  as detected in western blot in the two types of cells, is shown in figure 2a. we have estimated the quantitative differences between the intensities of the bands in figure 2a, and in several different pairs of latency i and iii cells , using the imagej densitometry program . the ebna- <dig> signal was between  <dig> – <dig>  times higher in latency iii compared to latency i cells, while oct- <dig> was  <dig> – <dig>  times higher in latency i cells compared to latency iii. in vivo binding of both ebna- <dig> and oct- <dig> to fr in these two cell types can be demonstrated by a chip-assay .

latency states in the model
our model displays regions of mono-stability, with either latency i or iii as the only stable state, and a region of bi-stability. for low oct-2+grg/tle levels, only latency iii is stable, while, for higher levels, there is a bistable region. this eventually gives way to the monostable latency i, at even higher oct-2+grg/tle levels. the net effects of production from the two promoters together with dilution and decay can conveniently be visualized by a production potential. the negative derivative of this potential, with respect to the number of ebna- <dig>  correspond to the net production rate of ebna- <dig>  figure  <dig> displays this production potential for three different levels of oct-2+grg/tle. at intermediate oct-2+grg/tle levels, the system is bistable, i.e. the production potential has two local minima . increasing the oct-2+grg/tle level eventually eliminates latency iii , while decreasing oct-2+grg/tle level eliminates latency i .

in our model, the level of ebna- <dig> in the two stable states is dependent on the oct-2+grg/tle levels, as can be seen from the positions of the minima in figure  <dig>  the model has a latency iii level of ebna- <dig> around  <dig>  proteins  when no oct-2+grg/tle complexes are present. this level decreases to around  <dig>  after which point this latency state vanishes.

the ebna- <dig> level in latency i varies less with oct-2+grg/tle levels, remaining around 700– <dig> proteins .

promoter activity
stability of the latency programs
the system volume was in our study estimated to be  <dig> * 10- <dig> l , but was increased and decreased ten-fold in sensitivity tests. for each volume size, the stable latency i and iii levels of ebna- <dig> was computed for different dimerization dissociation constants for ebna-1; 10- <dig> m, 10- <dig> m and 10- <dig> m, and varying levels of oct- <dig>  stable steady state levels were also computed for a five-fold lower oct- <dig> affinity to fr. the stability of the two latency states and their robustness to parameter changes can be quantified by the externally imposed change on ebna- <dig> levels that induces the system to transit from one state to the other. this measure is of course appropriate only in the bi-stable region, where both states exist. as shown in figure  <dig>  for most parameters latency iii is more stable than latency i, i.e., a larger change in ebna- <dig> levels is needed to induce a transition from latency iii to latency i than in the opposite direction. 

as the left plot in figure  <dig> demonstrates, the model is certainly sensitive to changes in affinity of oct- <dig> complex to fr. with a fivefold increase in affinity of oct- <dig> the position of the bistable region is shifted towards five times higher oct- <dig> levels, but the relative properties of the latency states do not change significantly. the right plot in figure  <dig> illustrates the sensitivity of the model to changes in volume and dimerization constant for ebna- <dig>  the impact of changes in the dimerization constant depends on the system volume, where the larger volume is less robust. comparing the red and blue lines in figure  <dig>  the effect of increasing the dimerization 10-fold results in a shift of the bistable region towards higher oct- <dig> levels. this shift is substantially larger for the same dimerization parameter increase in the larger volume . the model's response to changes in the volume parameter is primarily that the bistable region shrinks with increasing volume, and latency i ebna- <dig> levels rise.

inducing transitions
in figure  <dig> we illustrate how our model behaves when responding to changes in oct-2+grg/tle. initially, the cell is in latency i, with  <dig> ebna- <dig> proteins molecules per cell and  <dig> oct-2+grg/tle complexes per cell. decreasing the level of the oct-2+grg/tle complex by 30% quickly leads to an increase in cp activity and hence an increase in ebna- <dig> production. within four to five days ebna- <dig> levels have reached the levels of stable latency iii. transitions from latency iii to latency i on the other hand, requires quite high levels of the oct-2+grg/tle complex for an extended period of time. the affinity of oct- <dig> to fr being about  <dig> times weaker than the affinity of ebna- <dig>  oct-2+grg/tle needs to be in large excess over ebna- <dig> in order to fairly compete for binding to fr. given a level of about  <dig>  ebna- <dig> in latency iii, and the non-linear dependence of cp activity on ebna- <dig> concentration, one needs an oct-2+grg/tle level of about  <dig>  molecules, at least transiently, to lower ebna- <dig> levels sufficiently in  <dig> days . however, the switch can proceed slower with a lower level of oct- <dig> for a longer time . both transitions have their lower limits in time, due to maximum production rate and the slow degradation rate of ebna- <dig> 

discussion
ebv regulates fundamental properties of infected cells, and survives for long times in the host using different latency states, where we study the switch between the two extremes resulting in resting and proliferative states  <cit> . the molecular cell biology of the infection and ebvs association with various cancer types has been extensively studied. however, in order to fully understand how the virus survives in, and uses, its host cells we believe it is necessary to incorporate all information into a full, system level description. our model of the switch between latency iii and i is a first step towards such a model. the aim, besides opening the ebv research field to modeling, was to investigate whether ebna- <dig> and oct- <dig> regulation of cp and qp is sufficient to explain experimental results, and to identify important questions for further experimental studies.

a key effect in our model is the competitive binding of ebna- <dig> and oct-2+grg/tle to the cp enhancer fr. essential parameter values are hence binding affinities of ebna- <dig> and oct- <dig> to cognate sites. these binding affinities together determine the behaviour of the two involved promoters, and thereby also the switch between latency programs. although it is well established that ebv can activate resting b-cells into proliferating blasts, the question how precisely this process is induced is still open. in our model, in order to keep the cell resting, using only qp to produce ebna- <dig>  a high enough level of oct-2+grg/tle is necessary in the cell. when oct-2+grg/tle levels drop, ebna- <dig> can access fr and trigger cp transcription. since cp is positively auto-regulated, working on a high production rate, ebna- <dig> levels then quickly increase once cp has been turned on.

we show that our model of the ebv latency switch displays expected features of the switch. at different oct- <dig> concentrations, the switch is either monostable, and then exhibits states of either latency i or latency iii, or is bistable. this behavior is robust to several parameter changes, although the boundaries and size of the stability domains vary. that the bistable region extends up to a higher level of oct- <dig> in the system, when lowering oct- <dig> affinity to fr, is to be expected, since a lower affinity requires a higher oct- <dig> level to inhibit cp transcription. also, the fact that the model's sensitivity to changes in ebna- <dig> dimerization is correlated with the system volume, can be explained. with a smaller system volume, the concentration of ebna- <dig> is higher. with a concentration of ebna- <dig> higher than, or of same order as, the dimerization dissociation constant, there will be no significant impact in changing this parameter. besides correlating with dimerization of ebna- <dig>  a noticeable effect of volume increase is the shrinkage of the bistable region, with respect to oct- <dig> levels. this correlates with the larger number of ebna- <dig> for latency i. latency iii amounts of ebna- <dig> does not differ much between different parameter sets since it is determined from the production rate based on the measured number of ebna- <dig> molecules . the latency i levels however, depends only on the concentration of ebna- <dig> in the cell, due to the negative feedback-loop, leading this number to vary.

regarding promoter activities, there is experimental data for c and q promoter transcripts in latency i and latency iii cells  <cit> . shaefer et al. present a qp/cp activity ratio of 5– <dig> in latency i cells, and  <dig> – <dig>  for latency iii cells  <cit> . zetterberg et al. show that latency i cells have 76–83% of all ebna- <dig> transcripts originating from qp, while less than 1% of ebna- <dig> transcripts in latency iii cells come from qp  <cit> . our theoretical predictions of activities of cp and qp presented in table  <dig> correspond quite well to these experimental results. the mutual exclusiveness discussed in experimental papers agrees with our results, except for latency i in the bistable region. what is striking is the dramatic difference in predicted activity for the two promoters, even when comparing their respective stable latency states. since the model is a simplified version of the in vivo mechanisms, our activities corresponds to the scenario without methylation or chromatin remodeling. this might explain the relatively low qp/cp activity ratio we see for latency i in the bistable region, since it is experimentally known that cp is hypermethylated in latency i cells  <cit> . lieberman's group recently published data showing that cp can be regulated by changes in chromatin structure exerted by chromatin organizing proteins ctcf, which has one binding site in the ebv genome between fr and cp  <cit> . this is compatible with our model as grg/tle can act as a chromatin remodelling protein by de-acetylating histones  <cit> . we believe it likely that the transcription factor recruitment and regulation is upstream of the chromatin regulating events in the switch, i.e. creates the signal that leads to chromatin remodelling.

there is as yet no experimental system to directly operate this switch in b cells in vitro. however there are models in ebv positive cell lines, which at least inefficiently mimics this switch, particularly the latency iii to latency i transition by cd  <dig> ligand exposure or by rna interference  <cit> . experimental results indicate that proliferating ebv-transformed immunoblasts can be switched into a more restricted latency program within  <dig> days, due to a decrease in cp activity  <cit> . according to our model, for this transition to occur in  <dig> days, oct- <dig> levels need to be elevated up to 10-fold. the higher the oct- <dig> level already in latency iii, the lower fold increase of oct- <dig> is necessary. the increase is however only required temporarily, since stable latency i state can persist even for quite low oct- <dig> levels. although a qualitative comparison between our experimental and theoretical molecular levels is possible, it is at this stage not enough to determine whether the switch is carried out between monostable states or in the bistable region. further experiments with silencing of oct- <dig> rna followed by time series measurements on ebna- <dig> and oct- <dig> levels, should shed light on this matter.

noise plays an important role in gene regulation and in models of gene regulation when the levels of regulatory factors are low, and in primarily dynamic phenomena, when there is a choice between different pathways. noise also decreases stability and robustness of steady states. for most parameter values in the bistable region, the latency i state is more easily perturbed than latency iii. a consequence is that a switch from latency i to latency iii can be expected to occur in response to smaller external stimuli.

however, since there is no compelling reason for the ebv switch to operate in the bistable region, the influence of noise is likely to be small. furthermore, the protein levels are relatively high in both latency states, reducing the impact of stochastic effects.

although the structure of the fr invites consideration of cooperative binding of ebna- <dig>  to these binding sites, no experimental data is at present available. stress testing the model involving these additional effects is in progress, and will be reported elsewhere. the addition of cooperative binding would not affect the qualitative functions of the switch, while it might influence the quantitative measurements, such as protein levels and the switching times. another issue in modelling gene regulatory systems is whether important entire elements are left out. while this cannot be determined within a model, the propensity that it is the case can be adjudged from the model properties. we argue that our model is consistent with the knowledge present today, while it is clear that regulation of oct- <dig> or grg/tle would logically complete the present model, as would information about other genetic feedback loops between the virus and its host cell. this then defines important tasks for the future.

CONCLUSIONS
we have here shown that fundamental properties of the ebv infection, with high relevance for the virus as a risk factor in human cancer, can be modelled and understood mathematically. the model involves mechanisms which have, to our knowledge, only been used in models of simpler genetic systems before. however, also for this more complex system, these mechanisms nicely describe the dynamics and the properties of the viral genetic control.

a first conclusion is that ebna- <dig> and oct-2+grg/tle regulation of cp and qp is enough to establish mutually exclusive expression patterns, correlating with experimental data. secondly, the switch manifests both mono- and bistable behavior, with the latency iii state being markedly more robust. this in turn results in very different transition time scales between the latency states.

our results and predictions moreover stress the importance, of the largely unknown regulation of the human transcription factor oct- <dig> to the life-cycle of ebv.
