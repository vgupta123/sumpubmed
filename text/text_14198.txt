BACKGROUND
the completion of human and rodent genome sequences  <cit>  has brought the post-genomic era to the field of endocrine research. detailed genetic maps of the main endocrine models can now be used to study the molecular basis of endocrine disease and the molecular mechanisms of hormone actions. the possibility to explore expression data of thousands of genes across multiple experimental paradigms promise to rapidly increase our understanding of biological systems  <cit> . the acquisition of experimental data at a genomic scale requires high throughput technologies such as dna microarray analysis. microarrays enable the simultaneous assessment of expression levels of tens of thousands of gene products in an ease to perform assay. microarrays are especially attractive to the field of endocrine research because regulation of gene expression is an important mechanism whereby hormones exert their physiological actions. this is obvious in the case of steroid and thyroid hormones, which use intracellular receptors belonging to the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors  <cit> . peptide hormones also regulate gene expression after activating complex cascades of intracellular signaling events upon binding to transmembrane receptors  <cit> . if the relation between hormones and the expression of different genes could be annotated, the abundant knowledge concerning endocrine physiology might be used to clarify the biological function of those genes. on the other hand, because expression profiles are rich in information, they are suitable to study the complex and pleitropic actions of hormones.

here we analyzed a compilation of rat liver expression profiles from experiments designed to study gender and hormone actions in order to provide novel insight into the mechanisms of action of specific hormones. the dataset used in this study comprises the actions of thyroid hormone , 17-α-ethinylestradiol and gh in liver. the data is freely available from the endocrinology gene expression database –  and have also been deposited in gene expression omnibus . using this collection of microarray data, we analyzed the differential contribution of estrogens and gh to the regulation of gender differentiated liver gene expression. we also compared the actions of gh and t <dig> in liver and found a small overlap comprising genes involved in lipogenesis suggesting the common regulation of srebp transcription factors. the regulation of srebp <dig> by gh and thyroid hormone was analyzed.

RESULTS
exploring hormonal regulation of gene expression in liver
several expression profiles where compiled and used to obtain insight into the hormonal regulation of liver physiology. the following six experiments were analyzed together : 17-α-ethinylestradiol treatment of male rats, infusion of bgh in young  male rats  <cit> , infusion of hgh in old  male rats  <cit> , bgh treatment of primary hepatocytes isolated from young male rats, comparison of female and male rats  <cit> , and the rapid effects of t <dig> treatment of hypothyroid mice  <cit> . the following questions were formulated: can expression profiling be used to clarify the physiological actions of hormones in the liver? can promoter analysis of hormonally regulated genes provide novel insight into the mechanism of hormone actions? it should be noted that our intentions were not to exhaustively explore the data set but rather to illustrate the utility of microarray data mining in endocrine research. the experiments included in this analysis were not specifically designed to answer the questions formulated in the present study although they are sufficient to test our hypotheses. this mimics the situation when the experimental biologist try to derive knowledge from a set of disparate experiments performed in different laboratories, using different experimental designs and microarray technologies. importantly, we have taken all possible measures to minimize systematic experimental errors. all the arrays used for analysis have been fabricated in house from a unique set of pcr products and these have been validated in numerous studies  <cit> . the protocols for labeling and data analysis were also similar along all the experiments. within each of the experiments included in this analysis, we have accounted for biological variability by independent replication of the measurements using rna from individual animals.

unsupervised clustering algorithms were first used on the entire dataset to gain a global view of different hormone actions in liver. average-linkage hierarchical clustering  was used to evaluate the relation between the expression profiles. as shown in figure 1a, the effects induced by gh treatment in young males were similar to those induced by gh treatment in old animals. this observation supports the robustness of the gh effects since the designs of the two experiments differ not only regarding the age of the animals but also in the dose and type of hormone administered . a calculation of the correlation coefficients between bgh-induced expression changes and the rest of the experiment groups supports this conclusion . interestingly, the expression changes induced by gh treatment of primary rat hepatocytes cultured on matrigel show a positive, although small, correlation with the effects observed in vivo . this suggests that hepatocytes significantly contribute to the expression changes measured in intact liver upon gh treatment. the fact that well-known gh-regulated genes: insulin-like growth factor  <dig> and cyp2c <dig>  <cit>  are also regulated in hepatocytes helps to substantiate our conclusion. the similar effects on gene expression after in vivo or in vitro gh treatment were confirmed for some genes using quantitative real-time pcr .

as shown in figure 1b, the correlation between gh treatment and thyroid hormone or estrogen treatment in young males was rather low. this is not surprising since both hormones have distinct liver functions not always overlapping those of gh. differences in expression can also arise from the choice of treatment duration, dose and mode of hormone treatment and this could result in the underestimation of commonly regulated genes. this ambiguity can only be resolved by measuring more expression profiles in experiments specifically designed to study hormonal interactions.

gh and estrogen contribute to gender differences in hepatic gene expression
when we compared the gender-related expression differences to the rest of the experiments , it was evident that as many as 48% of the female-enriched transcripts were also up-regulated by continuous gh infusion in  <dig> month old males. similarly, around 34% of the male-enriched transcripts were down-regulated in males by the same treatment. few genes  were affected in the opposite direction by continuous treatment with gh. on the other hand, estrogen treatment in  <dig> month old male rats induced the expression of 27% of the female-enriched genes, and repressed the expression of 27% of the male-enriched ones . again, few genes  were affected in the opposite direction by treatment with estrogen. this data strongly suggest that both estrogen and gh significantly contribute to the gender differences in adult rat liver. although, as illustrated in figure 1c, one week of continuous infusion with gh is more efficient than an injection with 17-alpha-ethynilestradiol to feminize the adult male rat liver expression profile.

t <dig> and gh regulate lipogenic genes in liver
both gh and t <dig> are required for longitudinal growth. therefore, we expected these hormones to have some overlapping effects on liver gene expression. nevertheless, we found that similarities were limited to a small number of genes . a comparison of frequency distribution among gene ontology  categories related to the biological function between the whole set of expressed genes and those up-regulated by t <dig> and gh revealed a statistically significant overrepresentation  of regulated genes in the category of lipid metabolism. similar overrepresentation of genes involved in lipogenesis was identified among the genes induced by thyroid hormone.

the srebp family of transcriptional regulators plays an essential role in the regulation of lipogenesis and is known to regulate several of the genes found to be induced by thyroid hormone   <cit> . because the transcriptional effects of t <dig> were rapid, we hypothesize the existence of a direct mechanistic crosstalk between srebps and t <dig> signaling in mouse liver. therefore, we analyzed the promoter regions of t3-induced genes to find out whether any consensus srebp binding sites could be found in promoter regions. the genes that were included in this analysis are indicated with a * in table  <dig>  interestingly, we could identify a clear overrepresentation of putative srebp binding sites around the transcriptional start site in the t3-regulated group compared to the control group . to make sure that this result was not only due to higher phylogenetic conservation in the t3-regulated group, a basic statistic analysis was performed: the region from - <dig> to + <dig> relative the transcriptional start sites  was picked out of each alignment in both groups. a simple two-sided t-test of the mean conservation in both groups showed that they were not significantly different . in fact, the t3-regulated group had a slightly lower  mean degree of conservation than the control group. we tested if the distribution of srebp sites was significantly different between the two groups using chi-square analysis. as the number of genes in the control group was higher, this distribution was normalized to correspond to  <dig> genes instead of the original  <dig> controls. the test demonstrates conclusively  that the two distributions are different and thus that there is a clear overrepresentation of putative srebp binding sites near the tsss in the t3-regulated group . in contrast, we were not able to localize a significant overrepresentation of thyroid hormone response elements  in the close promoters of the t3-regulated genes. we can not exclude that tres exist in the promoters of these genes, but either they are located further away from the transcriptional initiation sites or in areas that are not phylogenetically conserved between mice and humans.

three different srebp isoforms, 1a, 1c and  <dig>  encoded by two distinct genes have been described. srebp1c is the predominant form in adult liver and adipocytes  <cit> . srebps are translated as large precursors tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane where they, in response to sterol depletion, are proteolytically cleaved into mature, transcriptionally active factors that migrate to the nucleus and bind sterol regulatory elements of specific genes  <cit> . the mechanisms whereby t <dig> regulate srebp actions have been previously studied but remain unclear. long-term treatment with t <dig> has been shown to induce srebp <dig> expression in hepatocytes  <cit> . we tested whether rapid transcriptional induction could account for the observed up-regulation of lipogenic genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  t <dig> treatment had no effect on srebp1c or srebp <dig> mrna levels whereas the expression of srebp1a was significantly reduced. the results demonstrate that rapid transcriptional induction of srebps is not the mechanism behind the t <dig> regulation of lipogenic genes. since the set of genes overlapping between t <dig> and gh contained mostly genes involved in lipid metabolism, we also analyzed the transcriptional induction of srebp1a, 1c and  <dig> after long term gh treatment, but failed to detect any significant effect that could explain the up-regulation of lipogenic genes .

we next explored whether early events in srebp activation, such as the proteolytic processing of endoplasmic reticulum  resident srebps could be regulated by t <dig>  the er and nuclear forms of srebp <dig> were measured before and after t <dig> treatment. the analysis was extended to study the effects of gh treatment. the western blots in figure  <dig> show a decrease in the concentration of er bound  srebp <dig>  indicating a rapid activation of its proteolytic processing by t <dig>  no significant effect of t <dig> could be detected for srebp <dig> . interestingly, the concentration of the nuclear  form of srebp <dig> was also reduced indicating that the total nuclear concentration of srebp <dig> poorly reflects its activity as judged by the transcriptional induction of target genes. in contrast to the findings with thyroid hormone, the effect of gh doesn't seem to be exerted through similar mechanisms since no significant changes in er or nuclear srebp levels were evident after gh treatment . it is therefore possible that alternative mechanisms such as rna stability or even the activation of other transcription factors account for the gh effects on lipogenic genes.

discussion
here, we have attempted an analysis of a compilation of expression profiles to gain insight into the hormonal regulation of liver gene expression. we demonstrated that a positive correlation exists between the effects of gh treatment in primary hepatocytes cultured on matrigel and those detected in vivo. nevertheless, the correlation was not very high despite the care taken of cultivating the hepatocytes on matrigel to avoid de-differentiation. we know from previous studies that hepatocytes cultured on matrigel express gh receptors, that gh signalling through the jak2/stat <dig> pathway is functional and that gh induces igf- <dig>  a well- known gh regulated gene in vivo  <cit> . therefore, the differences between the in vivo and in vitro models are likely due to structural and systemic factors found in intact liver which would be required for the full extension of gh actions. on the other hand, our data demonstrate that primary hepatocytes cultured on matrigel do provide a model to study some gh activated mechanisms; those directly related to the activation of the gh receptor and its signaling molecules. the newly described gh regulated genes in hepatocytes : phytanoyl-coa hydroxylase , hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase  <dig> , the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase  <dig>  alpha isoform  and fatty acid translocase/cd <dig> antigen  constitute new target genes that could be used to study the basis of transcriptional regulation by gh in hepatocytes.

our global assessment of gene expression, demonstrates that estrogen and to a larger extent, the female-like continuous pattern of gh secretion are important for the maintenance of the gender differences in liver gene expression . these data support the existence of a cross talk in the hepatic actions of gh and estrogens for the regulation of a subset of the female-enriched genes. the exact mechanism of this cross talk cannot be extracted from the data, but previous findings offer a possible explanation. it is well known that the liver expresses relatively low levels of estrogen receptor and that some estrogen-induced effects in liver, including the expression of the estrogen receptor itself, may be secondary to its feminizing effect on gh pituitary secretion  <cit> . the role of gh secretory patterns in determining gender differences in rat liver expression of genes involved in sterol and drug metabolism has been described before  <cit> . here and in recent studies by ahluwalia et al  <cit>  and stahlberg et al  <cit> , the significance of this regulation is demonstrated at a more comprehensive level and novel hepatic gender-regulated genes are identified. we don't know yet how gender determines the transcription of these genes. to the date, only a few gender-predominant and gh-regulated transcription factors have been identified, including female predominant hnf- <dig>  <cit>  and male predominant stat5b  <cit> . nevertheless, an analysis of promoter sequences of the genes identified in table  <dig> has failed to identify any significant overrepresentation of hnf- <dig> or stat <dig> consensus binding sites . therefore, further analyses are required to better understand the molecular mechanism behind the feminizing actions of gh in liver.

both gh and thyroid hormone are required for longitudinal growth  <cit> . the coordinate actions of these hormones are achieved through multiple mechanisms. thyroid hormone is a key activator of gh secretion in the pituitary gland while gh promotes the formation of t <dig> from less active t <dig> in peripheral tissues  <cit> . through the comparisons of expression profiles, we could identify a small group of genes that were up-regulated by both hormones. most of the genes were assigned to the category of lipid metabolism by unbiased classification based on the current gene ontology. this is in agreement to the known lipogenic effects of both hormones in liver  <cit> . the correlation between gh and t <dig> effects was small which could be due to important differences in experimental design as well as to mechanistic differences. therefore, the study of the long term effects of t <dig> treatment has the potential to identify more overlapping effects.

the effects of t <dig> described herein are produced after  <dig> hours of treatment and are likely to be direct hormonal effects on the liver. therefore, we analyzed the proximal promoter of genes rapidly regulated by t <dig> to gain further insight into the mechanisms of hepatic t <dig> actions. interestingly, we were not able to localize a significant overrepresentation of tres in the close promoters of the t3-regulated genes. on the other hand, we found a clear overrepresentation of putative srebp binding sites; in agreement with the lipogenic nature of the t3-regulated genes. further analysis did not detect any transcriptional induction of srebps by t <dig>  instead, we showed that t <dig> decrease the concentration of er-bound srebp <dig>  probably due to induction of its proteolytic processing. regulation of srebp activity by t <dig> seems to be complex and involves multiple mechanisms. the thyroid hormone receptor  and active srebp1c can cooperate to activate the transcription of a single gene even when their response elements are situated very far apart  <cit> . moreover, direct interaction between tr alpha and the active form of srebp <dig> has been demonstrated when their binding sites are closely located in the promoter of the chicken acetyl-coa carboxylase-α gene  <cit> . direct interactions between tr and er-resident srebps are unlikely to be responsible for the effect observed in this study since the two proteins have different intracellular localizations  <cit> . nevertheless, this possibility can not be completely discarded since 10% of trs are found in the cytosol both in the absence or presence of t <dig>  <cit> . non-genomic effects of t <dig> such as the activation of pi- <dig> kinase, mek and stat transcription factors have been reported in several systems  <cit> . whether the rapid induction of srebp <dig> processing by t <dig> is due to a non-genomic mechanism of t <dig> action, or not, remains to be demonstrated. srebp proteolyticactivation in the golgi is regulated by its interaction with scap and insig- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . when sterols are present at high concentrations, the scap/srebp complex is retained in the er. when the sterol concentration is reduced, scap does not interact with insig and the scap/srebp complex exits the er and is delivered to the golgi where it is proteolytically cleaved. a role of scap as a monitor of the composition of the cytoplasmic leaflet of the er membrane has been proposed  <cit> . since t <dig> has been shown to bind the outer half of the lipid bilayer in reconstituted microsomes  <cit> , there is a hypothetical possibility that t <dig> could bind er membranes and regulate scap activity. it is important to notice that the concentration of the nuclear  form of srebp <dig> was also reduced upon t <dig> treatment. why this occurs simultaneously to the transcriptional induction of srebp target genes is unknown but a recent publication indicates that transcriptionally active srebp <dig> is rapidly targeted for proteosomal degradation  <cit> . if this mechanism is at play, one would expect the effects of t <dig> on lipogenic genes expression to be transient. this is indeed the case, most of the t <dig> effects on lipogenic genes can not be found after  <dig> days of hormonal treatment  <cit> . future studies will clarify the importance of srebps for thyroid hormone liver actions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have analyzed six different experiments concerning the hepatic actions of gh, t <dig>  estrogen and gender. we could conclude that gh and estrogen are both important determinants of gender-related differences in hepatic gene expression, that gh and t <dig> have overlapping effects on the regulation of several lipogenic genes, and that some t <dig> effects in the liver may be mediated through the induction of proteolytic processing of srebp <dig>  through endoged and its web-based interface, we have made available a large data set of transcript profiles related to the actions of several hormones in different in vivo and in vitro models. this resource is of special interest for the endocrine researcher offering the possibility of in depth exploration of hormonal transcriptional actions and interactions. in the same way, here exemplified by the analysis of hormone actions in liver, the actions of other hormones can be explored to generate testable hypotheses of relevance to endocrine research.
