BACKGROUND
eye development begins in the fourth week of life in a human embryo, and at embryonic day   <dig>  in the mouse embryo. bilateral protrusions of the developing forebrain neuroepithelium extend towards the surface ectoderm to form the optic vesicles. invagination of the optic vesicle together with the overlying surface ectoderm forms the bi-layered optic cup and lens vesicle respectively. the distal region of the optic vesicle gives rise to the inner layer of the optic cup, the presumptive neural retina . the proximal region of the optic vesicle forms the optic stalk and the outer layer of the optic cup forms the retinal pigmented epithelium . the optic cup is initially incomplete along the ventral surface and closure of the optic fissure marks the completion of the eye globe  <cit> . by around  <dig> weeks of human development  these critical stages of early eye morphogenesis are accomplished  <cit> . if disrupted, congenital malformations of the eye, such as anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and coloboma occur. these clinical conditions are heterogeneous and complex, probably involving genetic and environmental factors, however, a number of causative single gene mutations have been identified in humans or in murine models  <cit> . elucidation of the interactions between key genes may lead to the identification of common pathways that are critical for the formation and growth of the embryonic optic cup.

during the morphological transition of the optic vesicle into the optic cup, formation of the dorsal  part of the optic cup precedes formation of the ventral  part and closure of the optic fissure. as the optic cup forms in the chick and the mouse embryos, the ventral retinal region has a higher rate of proliferation compared with the dorsal retinal region  <cit> . recent cell lineage tracing experiments carried out in chick embryos, using replication defective retroviruses suggested that the dorso-ventral  axis of the neural retina is divided into multiple domains of restricted gene expression which exhibit features of lineage compartments, with clones of cells originating within one compartment rarely crossing to neighbouring compartments  <cit> . thus, differential regulation of cell proliferation within domains of gene expression across the d-v axis may be a mechanism driving the formation of the globe-like structure of the optic cup. the molecular mechanisms that pattern and shape this early growth phase of eye development are not well understood.

signaling centres are believed to define 'patterning axes' within developing tissues through the diffusion of signaling molecules/morphogens and/or propagation of secondary relay mechanisms  <cit> . asymmetric distribution of several secreted signaling molecules including bone morphogenetic protein , sonic hedgehog  and retinoic acid  are implicated in regulating the development of the vertebrate eye  <cit> . ra signaling is needed for normal eye morphogenesis in mouse  <cit>  and alteration of levels of ra signaling causes deletion or duplication of the ventral zebrafish retina  <cit> . shh overexpression in zebrafish causes optic stalk hypertrophy and mutation of the human shh gene is associated with holoprosencephaly and coloboma  <cit> .

while important regulators of ventral retinal development have been identified  <cit> , there is less understanding of the requirements for dorsal regulators in patterning and development of the dorsal retina or how they may affect formation of the ventral eye. the studies reported here focus on the role of bmp <dig>  which is specifically expressed in the dorsal retina of several vertebrate species including the mouse  <cit> .

bmps direct d-v patterning in both invertebrate and vertebrate embryos and are thought of as morphogens acting throughout a field of cells in a graded fashion  <cit> . decapentaplegic , the bmp <dig> homologue in drosophila melanogaster has been at the forefront of morphogen studies exploring how endogenous morphogen gradients are shaped and interpreted to create boundaries for bmp target gene expression  <cit> . in vertebrates, a common role for bmp <dig> in tissue morphogenesis is emerging, notably in the limb, the mandible, and the beak  <cit> . variation in the pattern of bmp <dig> expression was recently shown to affect the shape and size of closely related finch beaks originally described by darwin; bmp <dig> misexpression in chick embryos, causes morphological transformations paralleling the beak morphology of the large ground finch  <cit> .

bmp action in the nervous system includes effects on neural induction, cell fate determination, apoptosis and proliferation  <cit> . in the chick retina, bmp <dig> has been implicated in regulating programmed cell death in the dorsal optic cup  <cit>  and in regulating topographic mapping of retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . overexpression of the bmp antagonist, noggin, in chick, induces microphthalmia and coloboma, together with other ventral abnormalities, suggesting that endogenous bmps have significant effects on the development of ventral optic cup structures  <cit> . experiments in which optic vesicle explant cultures from bmp <dig> null mice were treated with bmp4-soaked beads have shown that bmp <dig> signaling is essential, but not sufficient, for lens formation  <cit> . bmp <dig> null embryos die at midgestation and optic vesicle development is arrested, hampering direct analysis of the role of bmp <dig> in optic cup development. in bmp4+/- mice, the optic cup forms, but mature eyes show anterior segment abnormalities as well as an increased incidence of microphthalmia  <cit> . deletions of human chromosome 14q, including the bmp <dig> gene have been identified in patients with anophthalmia  <cit> .

candidate downstream targets of bmp <dig> signaling in the mouse retina include members of the evolutionarily conserved t-box gene family of transcription factors. in drosophila, dpp regulates omb, a t-box gene critical for development of the fly visual system  <cit> . we have previously characterised the expression of three omb-related genes of the tbx <dig> subfamily, tbx <dig>  tbx <dig>  and tbx <dig> to be dorsally restricted in the human and mouse optic cup  <cit> . these genes are closely related and likely evolved from an ancestral tbx2/omb gene via an unequal recombination event, followed by gene duplication, prior to the divergence of the invertebrate and vertebrate lineages  <cit> . several studies in other species also support the idea that tbx <dig> subfamily genes are regulated by bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> overexpression by electroporation in chick and xenopus embryos induces ectopic tbx <dig> expression in the retina  <cit> . in the chick, tbx <dig> expression in the limb is also dependent on bmp signaling  <cit> . there is not yet functional evidence for the importance of the tbx <dig> subfamily genes in mammalian eye development, however misexpression of tbx <dig> in chick embryos, perturbs retinotectal projections  <cit> . recent work has also shown that tbx2b  in zebrafish may be important specifically for differentiation of retinal neurons in the dorsal retina  <cit> .

here we have developed the use of whole mouse embryo culture to test the hypothesis that bmp <dig> signaling regulates t-box gene expression in the developing mouse eye. this is the first time that implantation of growth factor soaked beads have been used to examine patterning of the developing mouse eye in vivo. we examined whether perturbation of bmp <dig> levels affect optic cup growth and shape. we report that tbx <dig>  tbx <dig>  and tbx <dig> are all responsive to manipulations of bmp <dig> signaling, but that each gene responds differently. we found that increasing bmp <dig> signaling by addition of exogenous bmp <dig> alters the molecular patterns of gene expression across the d-v axis in a ventral shift, while addition of the bmp antagonist, noggin induces a dorsal shift. these changes in gene expression are associated with a reduced retinal volume, primarily due to reduced cell proliferation and alterations in the axial lengths of the optic cup, indicating that correct levels of bmp signaling are important for the growth and the shape of the embryonic eye.

RESULTS
nested expression of bmp <dig>  tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> in the mouse optic cup
the expression pattern of bmp <dig> and members of the tbx <dig> subfamily were compared during development of the optic cup in mouse embryos. bmp <dig> expression was detected in the dorso-distal optic vesicle from e <dig>   in the region of neuroepithelium contacting the surface ectoderm. the distal optic vesicle is the presumptive neural retina. tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> were expressed in a similar region of the presumptive neural retina as bmp <dig> at this stage . bmp <dig> and tbx <dig>  but not tbx <dig> were expressed in the mesenchyme ventral to the optic vesicle . bmp <dig> was also expressed in the surface ectoderm , as previously reported  <cit> .

during optic cup invagination at e <dig> , the bmp <dig> expression domain in the dorsal neural retina remained similar to that of tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> . by e <dig> , tbx <dig> and bmp <dig> were co-expressed in the dorsal-most region of the optic cup, designated domain  <dig> , whereas tbx <dig> expression in the dorsal retina was broader and extended ventrally beyond domain  <dig> into a second domain designated domain  <dig> . a third tbx <dig> subfamily gene, tbx <dig>  was also expressed in domain  <dig> and extended into domain  <dig> in the temporal, but not nasal, neural retina . tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and bmp <dig> were also expressed in the mandibular and maxillary processes, ventral to the optic cup . expression domains  <dig> and  <dig>  were compared with the expression domain of a ventral marker, the vax <dig> homeobox gene. vax <dig> is expressed in the ventral-most region, designated domain  <dig> . the region lying between domains  <dig> and  <dig>  which expresses neither tbx <dig>  nor vax <dig>  was designated domain  <dig> .

bmp <dig> is thus highly expressed within the dorso-distal eye primordia, providing a dorsal source of bmp <dig> signaling throughout formation of the optic cup. the spatio-temporal overlap in the expression patterns of bmp <dig>  tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> in the dorsal eye supports the idea that bmp <dig> is an upstream regulator of these tbx <dig> subfamily genes during mouse eye development. that tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> are expressed in a broader domain than bmp <dig>  suggests that these genes may respond to bmp <dig> signaling which is acting some distance from the source of bmp <dig> expression. to test the hypothesis that bmp <dig> expressed in domain  <dig>  regulates t-box gene expression in domains  <dig> and  <dig>  we aimed to increase the level of bmp <dig> signaling by implanting growth factor soaked agarose beads into the mouse eye primordia and then observed the effect on gene expression domains.

we developed a system using whole mouse embryo culture, analogous to the method of bead implantation used in the developing chick embryo in ovo  <cit> . in contrast to widespread retroviral or plasmid overexpression approaches, growth factor soaked beads allow the establishment of a local signaling source to test the effect of diffusion of signaling factors across a field of cells. mouse embryos were cultured using established conditions  <cit> . control experiments were performed to ensure, first, that normal optic cup morphogenesis was achieved, and second, that implantation of beads soaked in the biologically inactive protein, bovine serum albumin , did not disrupt normal morphogenesis or gene expression. we found that normal eye development occurred ex utero during whole mouse embryo culture; embryos were cultured from three time points: e <dig>  ; e <dig>  ; and e <dig>  . in cba/ca embryos, optic vesicle invagination initiates at 24– <dig> somites and the optic cup forms by late e <dig> , at 33– <dig> somites. this process occurred faithfully in culture . normal growth and pigmentation of the optic cup also occurred in culture  and normal patterns of t-box gene expression were observed in post-culture embryos . implantation of bsa-soaked agarose beads around the optic vesicle and within the lens of the optic cup did not disrupt morphogenesis or gene expression . hence, embryo culture, combined with bead implantation provides a useful ex utero model for investigation of how alteration of bmp signaling affects patterning of the mammalian optic cup.

exogenous bmp <dig> induces t-box gene expression in the developing optic cup
bmp4-soaked beads were implanted in the dorso-temporal or dorso-nasal peri-ocular mesenchyme adjacent to the optic vesicle of e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryos, which were cultured overnight. beads soaked in recombinant bmp <dig> protein have previously been shown to be functionally active in the mouse embryo  <cit> . the bead implantation site was selected to provide an ectopic source of bmp <dig> signaling, and the effect of growth factor perturbation in the operated eye was compared to the contralateral non-treated eye in each embryo.

exogenous bmp <dig> induced ectopic tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> expression in the proximal optic vesicle, the presumptive rpe . the extension of the normal expression domain is visible in dorsal views of the embryos . transverse sections showed tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> up-regulation in the presumptive rpe that normally does not express the t-box genes, with tbx <dig> showing the most marked response . on the non-treated side, as well as in control embryos implanted with bsa-soaked beads, t-box gene expression was restricted to the dorso-distal optic vesicle .

to assess the effect of changing the level of bmp <dig> signaling during optic cup formation, bmp4-soaked beads were implanted adjacent to the optic vesicle of early e <dig>   embryos, prior to optic vesicle invagination, and embryos were cultured through the invagination process. tbx <dig> expression was never extended to the ventral retina and remained dorsally restricted . sections through the dorsal eye showed that tbx <dig> was induced in the presumptive rpe adjacent to the bead, consistent with observations at e <dig>  . rarely, exogenous bmp <dig> extended tbx <dig> expression into domain  <dig> in the ventral retina . no change in expression of vax <dig> or tbx <dig> was observed after bmp <dig> bead implantation . bmp4-soaked beads placed temporal to the eye gave similar results to nasal implantation .

tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> could not be induced in the ventral-most region, domain  <dig>  even when bmp4-soaked beads were placed ventral to the optic vesicle in e <dig>  and e <dig>  culture . exogenous bmp <dig> did not disrupt the process of optic vesicle invagination; normal optic cup formation occurred during the culture period. in summary, exogenous bmp <dig> protein induced ectopic expression of both tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> during optic cup formation.

noggin abolishes tbx <dig> and reduces tbx <dig> expression
to provide further evidence supporting the role of bmp <dig> signaling in regulating t-box gene expression, we used the bmp antagonist, noggin, to block bmp <dig> signaling in the eye . noggin has high affinity for bmp <dig> and prevents bmp receptor-ligand association, hence disrupting the signaling pathway  <cit> .

noggin-soaked beads were implanted close to the site of endogenous bmp <dig> expression, dorsal to the optic vesicle of e <dig>  embryos. noggin abolished tbx <dig> expression , but only reduced the tbx <dig> expression domain to the dorsal-most region of the eye, domain  <dig>  and did not markedly affect tbx <dig> expression . implantation of bsa-soaked beads in the same position as the noggin-soaked beads had no effect on either tbx <dig> or tbx <dig> expression . analysis of vax <dig> after noggin treatment showed that vax <dig> expression was maintained .

analysis of the morphology of manipulated eyes revealed that dorsal optic vesicle invagination initiated in the presence of noggin. however, the ventral region of the operated eye, showed a marked delay in the invagination process  when compared to the contralateral control eye . in operated eyes, invagination to form the optic cup had not occurred in ventral sections, and only the single layered neuroepithelium of the optic vesicle was observed , by contrast, formation of the bi-layered optic cup and increased growth of the presumptive neural retina was advanced in the ventral region of control eyes .

in summary, at e <dig> , noggin-soaked beads induced a dorsal shift in expression domains by repressing expression of tbx <dig> in domain  <dig> and tbx <dig> in domain  <dig>  thus, the dorsal-most region of the retina acquired the expression profile of domain  <dig>  in that it was tbx2-positive, tbx5-negative . although tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> expression was altered by increased or decreased levels of bmp <dig> signaling , tbx <dig> and vax <dig> expression appeared tolerant of the same changes in bmp signaling levels.

effect of disruption of bmp <dig> signaling on dorso-ventral patterning
to explore whether the concentration of bmp <dig> is important for defining distinct domains of gene expression in the mouse optic cup, and whether genes show different responses to alterations in the level of signaling, bmp4-soaked beads were placed centrally in the eye, within the lens vesicle of optic cup stage e <dig>  embryos. exogenous bmp <dig> added to the centre of the optic cup is at an equivalent distance from both the dorsal and the ventral retina, and by raising bmp <dig> levels throughout the eye, may disrupt the normal putative bmp <dig>  signaling gradient.

exogenous bmp <dig> resulted in the extension of tbx <dig> expression from domain  <dig> across the dorsal half of the retina, covering the normal site of tbx <dig> expression in domain  <dig> . ectopic tbx <dig> expression never crossed to the ventral half of the retina. tbx <dig> was expanded into the ventral retina to cover domain  <dig> , and tbx <dig> was expanded across domains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . strikingly,vax <dig> expression in domain  <dig>  was completely abolished in bmp4-treated eyes . tbx <dig>  but not tbx <dig> or tbx <dig>  was also induced in the lens . double in situ hybridisation for tbx <dig> and vax <dig> confirmed the expansion of tbx <dig> to entirely cover domain  <dig>  but not  <dig>  and the loss of vax <dig> in domain  <dig> . control experiments, carried out by implantation of bsa-soaked beads in the same location as bmp4-soaked beads either in the contralateral eye of the same embryo, or in parallel on somite-matched embryos never showed alterations in patterns of gene expression .

our findings show that exogenous bmp <dig> provided to the central region of the eye has shifted the normal gene expression boundaries ventrally by one or more domains , suggesting that the molecular division of the retina into gene expression domains is dependent on precise levels of bmp <dig> signaling. although all genes showed a ventral shift, their response was non-uniform suggesting that additional regulatory mechanisms exist. domain  <dig> , was expanded ventrally to cover the former site of the tbx5-negative, tbx2-positive domain 2; whereas the latter domain is now shifted to the more ventral former site of domain  <dig>  tbx <dig> showed a different response and shifted ventrally by two domains into the entire ventral retina. domain 3*, which shows the expression profile tbx5-negative, tbx2-negative, tbx3-positive is in the ventral-most region of bmp4-treated eyes and the vax2-positive domain  <dig> is lost in this ventral shifting of expression domains.

to assess bmp signaling in the optic cup we performed immunohistochemistry for the phospho-smad 1/5/ <dig> proteins which transduce the extracellular bmp signal to the nucleus  <cit> . phospho-smad 1/5/ <dig> labeling was highest in the dorsal retina , and in the lens in non-treated control eyes, while labeling was detected across a wider region in the retina of bmp4-treated eyes . these data suggest that bmp signaling in the retina extends beyond the bmp <dig> expression domain upon addition of exogenous bmp <dig> . bmp <dig> has previously been shown to upregulate the msx <dig> homeobox gene in other systems  <cit> . since msx <dig> is expressed in the mouse optic cup  <cit>  we tested the effect of bmp <dig> bead implantation and compared the msx <dig> response to that of the tbx <dig> subfamily genes. exogenous bmp <dig> induced msx <dig> gene expression in a different pattern to any of the other marker genes tested; high level ectopic msx <dig> expression was detected in the lens, optic cup and surface ectoderm, as compared with control eyes .

change in eye size and shape after bmp <dig> treatment
bmp4-treated eyes of e <dig>  embryos, displaying a ventral shift in tbx <dig> subfamily gene expression domains, were examined for morphological abnormalities. these eyes appeared smaller in size and this difference was analysed by estimating retinal volumes. retina from bmp4-treated eyes were consistently smaller than those of contralateral eyes treated with bsa control beads .

we next investigated how the eye had changed in shape, and whether there was a change in the axial lengths of the optic cup associated with the changed gene expression patterns. for each embryo, the d-v, naso-temporal  and proximo-distal  axes of the bmp4-treated eye were measured and compared to the control eye of the same embryo. the percentage change in axial length between treated and contralateral control eyes were calculated . in the bmp4-treated group, the d-v axis of the bmp4-treated eye was smaller than the non-treated contralateral eye in every case . by contrast there was no significant difference between bsa-treated eyes and the non-treated control . neither was there a significant natural variance between the axial length of right and left eyes of non-treated cultured embryos .

100% indicates no change; d-v, dorso-ventral; n-t, naso-temporal; p-di, proximo-distal

similarly, the n-t axis of bmp4-treated eyes was reduced, although the reduction along the n-t axis of bmp4-treated eyes was less pronounced than that along the d-v axis . there was no significant difference in the bsa-treated group , nor in non-treated cultured embryos . by contrast, the p-di axis  was unchanged by the exogenous bmp <dig> .

these data show that the addition of exogenous bmp <dig> reduced optic cup size and the d-v and n-t axial lengths, though not the p-di axial length, thus inducing a change in the size and the shape of the optic cup. histological sections also showed the small eye size and the abnormally thin neural retina of bmp4-treated optic cups .

cell proliferation and cell death in bmp4-treated eyes
the differences in gene expression domains and optic cup size/shape observed after the addition of exogenous bmp <dig> to developing optic cups could be due to regional decreases in retinal cell proliferation or increases in apoptosis . to establish whether the altered gene expression domains correlated with regionalised changes in cell proliferation, retinal sections were immuno-labelled using the ph <dig> antibody, which labels mitotic cells in the retina at the ventricular surface. bmp4-treated embryos  were examined for differences in the number of ph3-positive cells either throughout the retina, or in the dorsal region  and the ventral region . there was a significant overall decrease in the mitotic index  in bmp4-treated compared with contralateral non-treated eyes in cultured embryos . comparisons of both dorsal and ventral cell counts between eyes showed that the number of ph3-labelled cells were significantly reduced after bmp <dig> treatment in both the dorsal  and the ventral  retina . non-treated eyes showed a significantly higher level of mitosis  in the ventral retina, compared to the dorsal region , but this difference was abolished in bmp4-treated eyes .

finally we used tunel labeling to assess whether the altered gene expression domains observed after bmp <dig> treatment were associated with increased or altered patterns of apoptosis. regionalised apoptosis could cause tissue ablation and loss of gene expression domains. for example ablation of ventral tissue could cause loss of the vax <dig> expression domain and reduction of eye size. bmp <dig> has been shown to promote apoptosis in other systems  <cit> .

in control eyes, tunel labeling was detected in the region of the optic disc and the optic stalk. occasionally, a few apoptotic cells were detected in the dorsal aspect of the retina . this low level pattern of cell death correlates well with previous reports of cell death in e <dig>  mouse embryos  <cit> . levels of tunel-labelled cells were compared in bmp4-treated and contralateral control eyes. no significant differences in apoptosis were detected in the ventral  or the central retina between bmp4-treated and control eyes, suggesting that loss of vax <dig> expression was not associated with apoptosis . instead, more tunel-positive cells were found at the vitreal edge in the dorsal retina , close to the source of endogenous bmp <dig> expression and where bmp <dig> levels appear highest after exogenous bmp <dig> addition. in total,  <dig> tunel-positive cells were detected in the dorsal region of bmp4-treated retina compared with  <dig> in contralateral non-treated eyes . we also carried out bmp4-bead implantations using higher doses of bmp <dig> to test whether this increased the level of apoptosis. widespread apoptosis and tissue ablation were detected throughout the neural retina . therefore, while excess bmp <dig> can induce widespread apoptosis in the retina, the level of bmp <dig> that caused ventral shifts of gene expression domains, was only associated with a modest increase in apoptosis in the dorsal eye.

taken together these data support the view that bmp <dig> signaling from the dorsal eye primordia is important for defining gene expression domains across the d-v axis of the retina. an increase in the level of bmp <dig> in the optic cup causes a shift in gene expression domains and expands the dorsal retinal territory at the expense of the ventral territories. these changes in gene expression domains fundamentally alter the molecular character of the optic cup. furthermore, these data suggest that alterations in the bmp <dig> signaling gradient disrupt differential regulation of cell proliferation across the d-v axis, thus affecting growth and shape of the optic cup.

discussion
using whole embryo culture and bead implantation, our analyses have provided new evidence for the critical importance of the level of bmp <dig> signaling for d-v patterning and growth of the developing mouse eye. our data suggest that bmp <dig> patterns the optic cup by dosage dependent regulation of target genes, tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> 

a conserved genetic pathway: bmp <dig> regulation of tbx <dig> subfamily genes
in whole embryo culture experiments, exogenous bmp <dig> induced tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> expression, while noggin repressed/reduced tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> expression in the developing retina, providing strong support for the idea that bmp <dig> signaling regulates t-box gene expression during mouse eye development. this is the first demonstration that all three members of the tbx <dig> subfamily, tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> genes are downstream targets of bmp signaling in the mouse eye. a recent paper reported loss of tbx <dig> expression in the optic vesicles of bmp4-/- mice  <cit> . previous reports have demonstrated bmp2/4/dpp regulation of tbx <dig> subfamily genes in the heart, limb and retina in other vertebrates and of omb in drosophila  <cit> . considered together, these data indicate that bmp2/ <dig> regulation of tbx <dig> subfamily genes is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved pathway, which has been recruited to regulate development and patterning of different tissues in vertebrates and invertebrates.

in the developing eye, tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> show differential responses to bmp <dig> signaling
our data suggest that in the eye, each t-box gene responds to bmp <dig> in a different manner. they are consistent with a model in which tbx <dig> responds to bmp <dig> close to the dorsal signaling source, while tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> can be induced in a wider area by lower levels of bmp <dig> secreted from the source. based on the expression pattern of bmp <dig> in the dorsal region of the optic vesicle and the optic cup, it is likely that bmp <dig> protein concentrations will be high in the dorsal and low in the ventral region of the eye; indeed the dorsal retina shows high levels of bmp signaling activity as determined by immunohistochemistry for phospho-smad 1/5/ <dig> proteins.

the different spatial response that each t-box gene showed and their close evolutionary relationship support a mechanism of direct regulation by bmp <dig> signaling, although we have not excluded the possibility that other intermediate factors regulate these genes. significantly, a recent study showed that the tbx <dig> promoter is directly regulated by bmp smads, in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using extracts from embryonic hindlimbs, as well as cotransfection assays  <cit> . in drosophila, molecular dissection of cis-regulatory sequences of omb, the homologue of vertebrate tbx2/ <dig>  revealed a dpp response element  <cit>  suggesting that omb may also be a direct target of dpp signaling. interestingly, tbx <dig> responded more vigorously than tbx <dig> to exogenous bmp <dig> administered to the lens, extending all the way to the ventral retina, whereas tbx <dig> did not extend as far and may need other factors or is being inhibited by factors present in the ventral retina. the fact that tbx <dig> expression is initially more restricted than the tbx <dig> expression domain, yet after exogenous bmp <dig> treatment it shows the greatest expansion suggests that other factors are regulating the expression of t-box genes along with bmp <dig> 

it has been proposed that tbx <dig> represses cvax and vice versa in the chick based on overexpression studies  <cit> . the cascade in the mouse appears to differ, as with increased bmp <dig> levels, we observed repression of vax <dig> without ventral expression of tbx <dig>  also, in vax <dig> null mice, the tbx <dig> expression domain is unchanged  <cit> . moreover the separation of vax <dig> and tbx <dig> expression in two non-overlapping domains  indicate that these factors are unlikely to control each other's expression.

tbx <dig> subfamily genes as regulators of apoptosis and proliferation
downstream targets regulated by the tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> transcription factors have not been identified in the eye. several in vitro studies implicate these genes in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. ectopic expression of tbx <dig> in osteosarcoma cells inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis  <cit> . tbx <dig> gene amplification has been detected in primary human breast cancer tumours, pancreatic cancer cell lines, and its overexpression detected in melanoma cell lines  <cit> . both tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> repress the expression of p14arf, and there is evidence for the repression of other cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p <dig>  p16ink4a, and p15ink4b by tbx <dig> in vitro  <cit> . moreover, both tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> show anti-senescence properties  <cit> , while a dominant negative form of tbx <dig> can induce senescence in a melanoma cell line  <cit> .

during embryogenesis, a similar pro-proliferative role has not been identified for these genes. in fact, it has been shown that the expression of p <dig>  p19arf, p16ink4a, and p15ink4b is normal in mice with a targeted mutation of tbx <dig>  and there is no evidence for a genetic interaction between tbx <dig> and p <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, tbx <dig> expression has been associated with a low rate of proliferation in the atrioventricular canal during heart development  <cit> . tbx <dig> has also been associated with the regulation of cell proliferation during embryogenesis. misexpression of tbx <dig> in the chick heart leads to inhibition of cell proliferation  <cit>  and in the limb, ectopic expression of tbx <dig>  leads to a truncated limb phenotype due to cell proliferation arrest  <cit> .

we observed a dosage sensitive increase in the amount of apoptosis in bmp4-treated eyes, which correlates with tbx <dig> expression in the dorsal retina, but not with the ectopic tbx <dig> or tbx <dig> expression in the ventral retina. alternatively, the homeobox gene msx <dig>  which is normally expressed in the dorsal neural retina  <cit> , could be mediating the apoptotic effect of the elevated bmp <dig> levels in the dorsal neural retina. msx genes mediate bmp induced apoptosis during development of other organs such as the hindbrain and the limbs  <cit> . the different response of msx <dig> and the t-box genes to bmp <dig> treatment suggests that these genes do not regulate each other. if tbx <dig> acts to reduce proliferation during optic cup formation, as recently found in the developing heart  <cit> , then tbx <dig> expansion into the ventral retina may contribute to the observed reduction in levels of proliferation after bmp <dig> treatment.

bmp <dig> dosage in the regulation of eye size and shape
addition of exogenous bmp <dig> in the mouse optic cup in embryo cultures resulted in a reduction in retinal volume and alterations in eye shape. in chick and xenopus, malformation of the ventral retina has previously been described after overexpression of bmp <dig> by electroporation  <cit> . increases in gene dosage, as well as loss of function are known to cause congenital eye malformations in humans and mice, for example in the case of the transcription factor genes pax <dig> and foxc <dig>  <cit> . our findings suggest that increased levels of bmp <dig> signaling may be detrimental; in the human population, such changes could occur, for instance, via genetic variation in regulatory sequences, gene duplication, or gain of function mutations. the recent report that anophthalmia occurs in embryos from crosses between bmp <dig> heterozygous mutants and mice homozygous for a disrupted allele of twisted gastrulation , a bmp binding protein that is thought to enhance bmp <dig> signaling in the eye  <cit> , also indicates that excess bmp <dig> signaling may be as harmful as loss of function.

the adverse consequence of reduced levels of bmp <dig> signaling for eye development has been explored in different systems. that optic vesicle development is arrested in bmp <dig> null mice  <cit>  first indicated the importance of bmp <dig> for normal growth. we observed an expansion of optic stalk and a reduction in the neural retina after addition of the bmp antagonist, noggin, close to the dorsal bmp <dig> signaling source in the mouse optic cup. in the chick embryo, misexpression of noggin induces primarily ventral abnormalities that include optic stalk hyperplasia  <cit> . conditional gene inactivation has also been used to analyse the effect of loss of the serine/threonine kinase membrane bound bmp receptors; bmpria, bmprib, and bmprii are expressed in the developing mouse eye  <cit> . whereas targeted deletion of bmpr1b alone disrupts the ability of many ventrally located ganglion cells to enter the optic nerve head  <cit> , conditional bmpr1a-/fx/bmpr1b-/-;cre double mutant embryos exhibit more profound structural abnormalities due to excess apoptosis and reduced proliferation at e <dig> , and show anophthalmia at birth  <cit> . in these mutants, the loss of bmpr1a and bmpr1b likely interfered with bmp <dig> signaling, as well as signaling by bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  from non-neural retinal sources  <cit> .

the findings of altered eye size and shape with loss and gain of bmp <dig> function, suggest that a bmp <dig> signaling gradient mediates control of proliferation across the d-v axis during optic cup morphogenesis. with exogenous bmp <dig>  we observed a significantly decreased level of retinal cell proliferation in both the dorsal and the ventral retina. regional differences in proliferation have recently been found during optic cup growth  <cit> , and we found that the exogenous bmp <dig> acted to equalise the differences in levels of proliferation across the d-v axis. other studies have linked excess bmp <dig> to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. for example, the bmp expressing region of the mouse telencephalon has a lower proliferative activity and higher level of apoptosis than the rest of the forebrain, and bmp4-soaked beads can induce apoptosis in telencephalic explants  <cit> . in the chick, exogenous bmp <dig> applied to the dorsal optic cup, or at early stages to the telencephalon also increases apoptosis  <cit> . however, in the same studies, addition of bmp <dig> to chick retinal cultures at later stages induced proliferation  <cit> , while reduced levels of bmp signaling  in the telencephalon was associated only with a decrease in proliferating cells  <cit> , highlighting that the cellular response to bmp <dig> signaling appears stage and context dependent. in our study, only at higher doses of bmp <dig> was widespread apoptosis induced.

threshold-specific requirements for bmp <dig> in optic cup development
our data show that a major role for dorsal bmp <dig> signaling in the developing mouse optic cup is to regulate gene expression across the d-v axis. it suggests that bmp <dig> may be critically important for providing a signaling gradient, which is used to demarcate gene expression domains across the d-v axis, with retinal cells expressing different transcription factor genes in response to different threshold levels of bmp <dig> activity. variations in smad binding site distribution between target genes or levels of other active cofactors are likely to contribute to the differential gene responses.

exogenous bmp <dig> treatment prior to optic cup formation affected tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  but not vax <dig> or tbx <dig>  and t-box gene expression changes were not induced in the ventral retina in contrast to the effect of exogenous bmp <dig> addition to the lens. these differences may be due to the different developmental stage, and/or the different range of bmp signaling from bead implantation in the lens compared with the extraocular mesenchyme. in the latter case the different intervening tissue between the bead and the retina that is exposed to the bmp signal may be significant; when a bead is implanted in the lens the intervening tissue is the lens, whereas from a bead located in the mesenchyme, the bmp signal has to pass through the presumptive rpe. we were only able to detect increased levels of phospho-smad 1/5/ <dig> immuno-labeling after bmp <dig> bead implantation in the lens, which correlates with our findings that lens bead implantation showed the most dramatic effect on gene expression domains. in this study it was not possible to distinguish if the bmp gradient regulates the expression of the tbx <dig> subfamily genes directly or indirectly. rather than the bmp gradient being directly responsible for the nested expression domains it is possible that there are other secondary molecules induced by bmp that carry the signal. however, our data considered together with recent data showing that the tbx <dig> promoter is directly regulated by smads  <cit>  strongly support the idea that these genes respond directly to a bmp <dig> signaling gradient.

although there are some differences in the specific gene expression patterns between chick and mouse, the broadly conserved pattern of gene expression domains across the d-v axis of the optic cup suggests that compartment-like units of clonally related cells defined by restricted gene expression domains, as previously described in the chick  <cit> , may also exist in the mouse. if this is the case, then our data suggests that altering the bmp <dig> concentration in the eye re-specifies the compartments of the retina along the d-v axis; increased bmp causes compartments to express markers normally expressed by their more dorsal neighbours, although the response to bmp <dig> is not uniform in the different genes examined. our analysis of proliferation and apoptosis support the conclusion that these changes in gene expression domains reflect changes in the identity of retinal territories rather than tissue loss. instead of being made up of domains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the post bmp-treatment eye consists only of domains  <dig>   <dig> and a modified domain  <dig> . the importance of correct spatial restriction of gene expression for topographic mapping of retinal ganglion cells to the brain is well established  <cit> ; our data suggests it is also important in regulating regional growth of the developing optic cup.

our finding that exogenous bmp <dig> not only extends expression of the dorsally expressed t-box genes in the optic cup, but also reduces the ventral marker vax <dig> support the idea that bmp <dig> signaling has a long-range action across the d-v axis, and that bmp <dig> may repress vax <dig> expression. bmp inhibitors, in particular ventroptin and dan, are known to be expressed in a ventral-high gradient in the chick eye  <cit> , although these expression patterns have not been reported in the mouse. the role of such inhibitors may normally be to block long range bmp <dig> signaling from acting in the ventral-most region , allowing vax <dig> expression, and preventing induction of dorsally expressed genes. in our study, increased levels of bmp <dig> at optic cup stage are apparently sufficient to overcome endogenous inhibitors, leading to vax <dig> repression and induction of t-box gene expression in the ventral retina.

also consistent with the proposal that bmp regulates vax <dig>  the recent informative study by murali et al  <cit> , showed that with reduced levels of bmp signaling, tbx <dig> expression was lost whereas vax <dig> expression was expanded into the dorsal mouse retina in bmpr1a-/fx/bmpr1b+/-;cre double mutants. in chick, retroviral overexpression of bmp <dig> was previously shown to repress expression of ventroptin  <cit> . alternative to direct regulation of vax <dig> by bmp <dig>  interaction with other ventral signaling pathways could be important, as in zebrafish and chick, hedgehog signaling from the ventral midline contributes to regulation of the vax gene  <cit> . mouse embryos cannot be cultured ex utero for long enough to analyse the effect of the shifted gene expression domains on late stages of eye development. nevertheless, the effect of loss of vax <dig> expression in the ventral eye has already been carefully studied in vax <dig> null mice and shown to cause profound defects in ventral eye formation and coloboma  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that bmp <dig> signaling from a dorsal site of expression, patterns the mammalian optic cup across the entire d-v axis, by dosage dependent regulation of target genes, tbx <dig>  tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and vax <dig>  our findings fit with the idea that a bmp <dig> signaling gradient across the developing optic cup is interpreted to create domains of bmp <dig> target gene expression. a conserved genetic pathway is emerging whereby bmp <dig> regulates members of the tbx <dig> subfamily in different tissues and organisms during organogenesis. increasing evidence suggests that tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> may regulate proliferation in cancer and in development and our data is consistent with a role for these t-box genes downstream of bmp <dig> in regulating proliferation of the optic cup. upon increasing the level of bmp <dig> signaling, growth of the embryonic eye was perturbed resulting in a reduction in retinal volume as well as the d-v and n-t axial lengths of the optic cup. that precise levels of bmp <dig> signaling are critical for normal mammalian eye development is becoming progressively more clear; it is likely that altered dosage of bmp <dig> is a mechanism underlying human congenital eye defects.
