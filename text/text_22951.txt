BACKGROUND
as much as 50% of the ~ <dig> billion base pairs in the human genome may be derived from repetitive dna sequence  <cit> . while repetitive dna is often referred to as "junk" dna, even when that term was originally coined it was hypothesized that junk dna may play an active role in genome function  <cit> . the notion that repetitive dna may play a regulatory role and be involved in the evolution of gene regulation was also postulated early on, although it was not until recently that there was evidence to support those ideas  <cit> .

a major category of repetitive dna is short interspersed nuclear elements , which are believed to have originated from the 7sl rna gene that is part of the ribosome complex  <cit> . in the human genome, the largest class of sines are alu repeats, which at ~ <dig>  million copies account for ~10% of the human genome  <cit> . alu elements were first characterized as ~ <dig> nucleotide repetitive sequences that contain an alui restriction site  from the bacterium arthrobacter luteus  <cit> . alu elements, which are still mobile in the human genome by virtue of the action of a line- <dig> reverse transcriptase  <cit> , are a relatively recent occurrence evolutionarily. they are found exclusively in primates, including humans, and hence are postulated to have entered the mammalian genome ~60- <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

alu elements have been implicated in several human diseases including leukemia, hemophilia and breast cancer, suggesting that their impact on human health may be significant  <cit> . there are several well characterized examples of alu insertions affecting splicing patterns and hence protein function  <cit> . a variety of transcription factor  binding sites  have also been characterized in alu elements, including sites for yy <dig>  <cit> , sp <dig>  <cit> , tumor suppressor p <dig>  <cit> , homeodomain and tata binding proteins  <cit> . nuclear receptors , which belong to a superfamily of ligand-dependent tfs, have also been found to have binding sites in alu elements: retinoid acid receptor   <cit> , estrogen receptor   <cit> , progesterone receptor   <cit>  and vitamin d receptor   <cit> . alu insertions have also been shown to alter the expression of at least six human genes: cd8a , keratin  <dig> , parathyroid hormone , wilm's tumor  <dig> , receptor for fc fragment of ige, high affinity i, gamma polypeptide  and breast cancer  <dig>  early onset   <cit> . therefore, alu sequences may regulate the level of transcripts and hence proteins in the cell, as well as the function of those proteins.

hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig> alpha,  is a member of the nr superfamily that is highly expressed in the liver, as well as the kidney, intestine , pancreas and stomach  <cit> . hnf4α is best known for its role in the adult liver and pancreas, as well as in early development  <cit> ; it also has an emerging role in the gut  <cit> . the hnf4Α gene is mutated in an inherited form of type  <dig> diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young  <dig>   <cit> , and was recently identified as a susceptibility locus in inflammatory bowel disease   <cit> . mutations in hnf4α binding sites have also been directly linked to human diseases, including hemophilia and mody <dig>  <cit> . many nrs are common drug targets  <cit> ; the recent identification of the endogenous ligand of hnf4α that binds in a reversible fashion also makes hnf4α a potential drug target  <cit> .

in addition to its medical relevance, hnf4α also appears to play a unique role in the evolution of nrs. it is highly conserved across species, with 100% amino acid conservation in the dna binding domain of all mammalian hnf4α. while hnf4α is most similar to the retinoid × receptor alpha , unlike many other nrs, it does not heterodimerize with rxr. rather, it binds dna in the form of direct repeats separated by one nucleotide  exclusively as a homodimer  <cit> . hnf4α has been found in every animal organism examined thus far, including sponge and coral  <cit> , and has been postulated to be the ancestor of the entire nr family  <cit> .

many hundreds of hnf4α target genes have been identified by both classical promoter analysis as well as more modern genome-wide studies  <cit> . during one such genomic study, we observed a very uneven frequency profile of individual hnf4α binding sequences  <cit> . specifically, we noted that a certain dna sequence designated h <dig>   was > 100-fold overrepresented compared to other hnf4α binding sites in the human, but not the mouse, genome . in the current study, we investigate the notion that these and other hnf4α binding sequences are in alu repeats. we use the powerful high throughput technology of protein binding micorarrays  to show that hnf4α does indeed bind numerous sequences in alu repeats in vitro. we perform chip and luciferase assays to show that hnf4α binds at least some alu sequences in vivo and that those binding events are associated with transcriptional activation. finally, we investigate accessibility of these sites by correlation with dnase hypsersensitivity data and evolutionary conservation by comparative genomic analysis.

RESULTS
hnf4α binds alu repeats in vitro
since genome-wide location analysis  often filters out or cannot distinguish the exact location of tf binding events in highly repetitive dna, we took a combined in vitro/in silico approach to determine whether hnf4α binds alu elements. we generated a custom protein binding microarray  that contained  <dig> unique alu-associated sequences . since rar was previously shown to bind dr2-like sequences  in alu repeats  <cit>  and since we have previously shown that hnf4α, while preferring dr1s, can also bind dr2s  <cit> , we also put on the pbm ~ <dig> permutations of dr <dig> and dr <dig> sequences as well as ~ <dig> random controls and ~ <dig> additional sequences in the human genome predicted by a support vector machine  algorithm to bind hnf4α  <cit> . each sequence was replicated four times for a total of more than  <dig>  spots of dna.

we found that human hnf4α <dig> bound  <dig> out of  <dig> alu-derived 13-mers in a significant fashion  . it also bound  <dig> out of  <dig> non alu-derived sequences, although eight of those sequences were subsequently found also to be associated with alu repeats at a frequency of > 90%. an exact match search of the entire human genome  with the  <dig> sequences that bound hnf4α in the pbm  showed that there are a total of  <dig> , <dig> occurrences of those hnf4α binding sites in the genome and that the vast majority  are in repetitive elements, of which most  are in alu repeats . this number is much greater than that previously found for rar binding sites in alu elements but that is most likely due to the fact that strict dr <dig> and dr <dig> consensus sequences were used for the genomic search  <cit> .

the position weight matrices  of the dr1- and dr2-derived sequences bound by hnf4α were essentially identical and suggested that for hnf4α the core of caaag is more relevant than the aggtca half sites . interestingly, the pwm of the alu-derived 13-mers bound by hnf4α did not contain a prominent caaag core but did contain an identifiable aggtca half site on the right hand side; the left hand portion was primarily c-rich. overall, the alu-derived pwm strongly resembled the non canonical hnf4α pwm we identified in our previous pbm study  <cit> , although the association of the non canonical motif with alu elements was not investigated. a partial list of dna sequences significantly bound by hnf4α in the pbm and their estimated frequencies in alu repeats and the human genome  is given in table  <dig> .

pbm score is the average relative intensity of quadruplicate spots across four arrays. score >. <dig> indicates significant binding.

hnf4α binds alu repeats in the promoter region of target genes in vivo
to investigate hnf4α binding to alu repeats in the promoters of hnf4α target genes in vivo, we performed a chip assay for hnf4α in human hepatocellular carcinoma hepg <dig> cells that express hnf4α and many of its target genes. several criteria were used for selecting potential alu sequences for chip analysis. first, the alu element had to contain a probable hnf4α binding site based on the pbm results. second, the gene containing the alu element had to be down regulated >  <dig> -fold by hnf4α rnai in hepg <dig> cells as determined by expression profiling  <cit> . third, the alu repeat had to be within - <dig> kb to + <dig> kb of the transcription start site  of the gene. fourth, the alu element had to be amenable to primer design and pcr amplification, non trivial criteria due to the repetitive nature of the sequences. overall,  <dig> sets of primers for  <dig> genes were designed, of which  <dig> sets gave a specific signal from the input control, indicating appropriate amplification of the alu sequence. finally, of those  <dig> primer sets,  <dig> genes yielded a significant signal in the hnf4α chip assay compared to the corresponding negative control igg . these results indicate that hnf4α binds the alu elements in the promoter regions of these target genes in vivo.

hnf4α activates transcription from alu elements
in order to determine whether the binding of hnf4α to the alu elements observed in vivo could drive transcription, we subcloned into a luciferase reporter construct with a minimal core promoter the pcr fragments containing the alu element with the hnf4α binding site . three of the genes chip'd by hnf4α in hepg <dig> cells were analyzed -- apom, ttr and prodh <dig>  transient transfection into an hnf4α-responsive cell line  showed that hnf4α <dig> significantly transactivates the luciferase constructs in a dose-dependent manner . while the fold induction was not large , it was comparable to two reporter constructs containing a single classical hnf4α response element  . to determine whether an hnf4α-alu element could contribute to transcription of a native promoter, we analyzed the apoa <dig> promoter construct that contained both an hnf4α-alu element as well as a classical hnf4α response element. the wildtype  promoter was transactivated well by hnf4α  and mutations in the hnf4α binding site in either the alu element or the classical response element reduced the transactivation  . while the effect of the mutation in the hnf4α-alu site was not large, it was statistically signficant  and comparable to the mutation in the classical site. taken together, these results indicate not only that hnf4α binds alu elements in the promoters of hnf4α target genes in vivo, but also that this binding can contribute to the overall transcriptional activity of the gene.

frequency of hnf4α sites in alu and non alu repeats
in order to determine the prevalence of hnf4α binding sites in alu elements, a search of all the alu repeats in the human genome  was performed with the ~ <dig>  sequences bound by hnf4α in pbm3; the vast majority of hits were obtained with the  <dig> +  <dig> alu-derived sequences. approximately ~ <dig>  out of ~ <dig> , <dig> alu repeats in repeat masker  were found to contain at least one dna sequence to which hnf4α bound in pbm3; there was also a substantial number of alu repeats  that contained more than one hnf4α binding site . all told there were nearly ~ <dig>  million hnf4α binding sites in alu repeats in the human genome.

different families of alu repeats were found to have different frequencies of hnf4α sites  and within a given alu family there was a range of frequencies . there was also a rough negative correlation between the percentage of alu elements within a given family that contained an hnf4α binding site and the age of the family. the newest alu family, aluy , had the greatest percentage of hnf4α sites ; the second newest family, alus , had the next highest percentage  and the oldest family, alu j , had the lowest percentage    <cit> . this correlation held for the precursors to the alu family as well. fam  sequences are alu precursors that gave rise to fram  and flam  sequences that eventually joined to create the modern dimeric alu element  <cit> . the frequency of the hnf4α binding sites in fam , fram  and flam_c  suggests that the hnf4α sites may have first appeared in alu-like sequences in the flam family. interestingly, not only does aluj have a similar frequency of hnf4α sites as flam_c, but the hnf4α sites in aluj are almost exclusively in the left arm at position  <dig> . in contrast, the newer alus family has significant secondary sites at positions  <dig> and  <dig> while the newest alu family, aluy, has essentially the same number of hnf4α sites at position  <dig> as at position  <dig>  although the number of sites at position  <dig> has remained relatively low. all told, these results suggest that there has been a gain of hnf4α binding sites in alu elements during the course of evolution. 

the human genome search also revealed ~ <dig>  occurrences of hnf4α sites in non alu repeats . the non alu repeat families were numerically dominated by repeats referred to as mammalian interspersed repeats , line <dig> elements  and tigger . however, while only ~1% of the mirs and l2s possess an hnf4α binding site, more than ~20% of tiggers do. in addition, more than 50% of the sva family of retrotransposons contain at least one hnf4α site, although this is not surprising since these elements contain a portion of an alu element .

frequency of hnf4α-alu elements in promoters and dnase hypersensitive sites
others have shown that the region  <dig> bp upstream from the tss  contains on average  <dig>  alu elements  <cit> . we analyzed the same promoter region and found that every human gene has on average  <dig>  hnf4α-alu elements, consistent with the overall high proportion of alu elements with an hnf4α site . to determine which alu elements may be accessible, and hence potentially play a role in transcription regulation, we determined the number of hnf4α-alu elements that reside within dnase hypersensitive regions using datasets from the encode project  <cit> . genome-wide  <dig>  hnf4α-alu elements  are within dnase hypersensitive regions across mutliple cell lines, with  <dig> genes containing one or more hnf4α-alu/dnase sites in their  <dig> kb promoter region. ~ <dig> hnf4α-alu elements are in dnase hypersensitive regions in hepg <dig> cells alone . while these findings may be an underestimate due to the difficulty of sequencing through repetitive elements, they nonetheless indicate that while the majority of the ~ <dig>  hnf4α-alu elements may not be accessible in most cell types, a sizeable portion of hnf4α-alu elements are in regions of open chromatin and hence may be transcriptionally active.

age of alu repeats in hnf4α target genes
in order to estimate the age of the various hnf4α-alu elements, we determined the presence of the alu elements bound by hnf4α in the hepg <dig> chip assay in four sequenced primate genomes - marmoset, rhesus, orangutan and chimpanzee. the first mammalian primate originated ~ <dig> million years ago . the marmoset monkey branched off from the human lineage ~ <dig> mya, the rhesus monkey ~ <dig> mya, the orangutan ~ <dig> mya and the chimpanzee ~ <dig>  mya  <cit> . the results show that all of the hnf4α-alu elements examined are older than humans , which is not surprising since only ~  <dig>  or  <dig> % of alus are human-specific  <cit> . five of the chip'd hnf4α-alu elements  were common among all the primate genomes, and thus fairly ancient . an additional two elements  also appear to be about  <dig> million years old but may have been lost after chimps diverged from the primate lineage. in contrast, five of the hnf4α-alu elements  appear to be somewhat newer  due to their presence in all primates except marmoset. the two most recent elements  appear to be in the il <dig> and apom genes since they are found only in orangutan, chimp and human. the alusq <dig> element in the il <dig> gene, however, could be older due to the fact that an entire region of the chromosome, including the il <dig> gene, is missing in rhesus . in the apom gene, our chip results could not distinguish whether the hnf4α site is in alujr or alusg7; it is also curious that the alusg <dig> element is only partially missing in both rhesus and marmoset . the alusp element in the prodh <dig> promoter, in contrast, appears to have entered the primate lineage after the divergence of the marmoset  but before the divergence of the rhesus monkey , consistent with the reported age of the alus subfamily  . assuming that the absence of the hnf4α-alu elements are not due simply to errors in genome assembly and/or misclassification of alu elements, these results suggest that hnf4α-alu elements could play a role in differential regulation of these genes in different primate species.

discussion
the functional relevance of repetitive dna such as alu repeats in the human genome has been debated ever since they were first discovered several decades ago. in this study, we show that the nuclear receptor hnf4α binds alu-derived 13-mers in vitro as well as alu elements in the promoters of hnf4α target genes in vivo. we show that hnf4α sites in alu elements can drive gene expression in luciferase assays and that hnf4α binding sites are found in ~64% of all known alu repeats in the genome . additionally, we found that while hnf4α sites are predominantly found in alu repeats, they are also found in other repeats such as sva elements, which contain a portion of alu repeat  <cit> , and l <dig>  mir and tigger families of retrotransposons.

functionality of hnf4α-alu elements
perhaps the most important question is how many of the hnf4α-alu elements are functional. several recent studies suggest that alu elements may indeed play a role in regulating gene expression: alu elements are enriched in regions with genes  <cit> , particularly in housekeeping and metabolism genes. however, they are underrepresented in developmental genes  <cit> , suggesting that their presence in those genes may be detrimental. binding sites for other nrs have also been found in alu repeats and several of those sites were found to affect transcription  <cit> . to determine what types of genes contain hnf4α-alu elements, we performed a gene ontology  analysis of genes enriched with hnf4α-alu elements  and found rna processing and transcription regulation genes, as well as macromolecular catabolic processes and complex assembly genes . rna processing is not a category previously associated with classical hnf4α binding sites, but alu elements have been found to play a direct role in alternative splicing  <cit> .

in a detailed, genome-wide analysis of functional targets of hnf4α and binding sites, we recently found that only 30% of genes down regulated in an hnf4α rnai experiment contained a potential classical hnf4α binding site  <cit> . while the other 70% could be indirect targets, it is also possible that some of those genes are regulated by hnf4α-containing alu elements, consistent with our finding here that on average every gene in the human genome contains ~ <dig>  hnf4α-alu elements within  <dig> bp upstream of the tss. on an individual gene basis, we found that even though the hnf4α binding sites in alu repeats are not high affinity sites compared to the majority of classical hnf4α sites, they are nonetheless capable of driving the expression of a heterologous gene on their own. in the context of the genome, however, the hnf4α-alu elements are typically present in conjunction with other tfbs in the promoter, including other hnf4α binding sites, suggesting that they may act in more of a modulatory capacity than as the sole drivers of transcription, as we observed on the apoa <dig> promoter. these results are similar to those found for other nrs albeit on different binding sites within the alu elements  <cit> .

the functionality of hnf4α-alu elements, as with any potential tfbs, will also depend on the state of the local chromatin and the accessibility of the site to hnf4α. while it has been reported that most alu repeats in the human genome contain cpg dinucleotides that are methylated  <cit> , potentially rendering them nonfunctional, the alu elements that are hypomethylated tend to be in promoter regions, suggesting that they are accessible  <cit> . indeed, our analysis showed that there may be as many as ~ <dig>  hnf4α-alu elements in dnase hypersensitive regions genome-wide, suggesting that they may be accessible for binding and therefore may affect transcription.

alu repeats as a sink for hnf4α protein?
in addition to affecting transcription directly, it is tempting to speculate that the relatively large number of hnf4α-alu elements, especially in regions of open chromatin, could act as a sink or reservoir for hnf4α protein. we have estimated by semi-quantitative immunoblotting that there may be as many as  <dig>  molecules of hnf4α in the nucleus of an adult mouse hepatocyte ; this estimate is consistent with the fact that we originally had to purify hnf4α only ~ <dig>  to  <dig> -fold from adult rat liver nuclei  <cit> . assuming that human hepatocytes have similar levels of hnf4α protein and keeping in mind that hnf4α binds dna only as a dimer  <cit> , this suggests that the presence of ~ <dig> to  <dig>  hnf4α-alu elements in accessible regions of the genome would not have a significant impact on the availability of ~ <dig>  hnf4α protein dimers in a normal adult hepatocyte nucleus. however, conditions that significantly alter the accessibility of the ~ <dig>  hnf4α-alu elements genome-wide, or the amount of hnf4α protein, could in theory result in a situation in which the stoichiometry of hnf4α-alu sites to hnf4α protein is indeed relevant. for example, global loss of dna methylation has been associated with cancer progression and there is at least one report in which certain alu elements lose methylation during tumor progression  <cit> . likewise, a decrease in the amount of functional hnf4α protein, such as that found in heterozygous mody <dig> patients  <cit> , activation of signaling pathways  <cit> , dna damage via p <dig>  <cit> , micrornas  <cit> , diet  <cit>  and diseases such as colitis and cancer  <cit>  could tip the balance between hnf4α protein and potential binding sites, rendering the notion of alu elements as a sink of hnf4α potentially relevant. the stoichiometry of hnf4α protein to total hnf4α binding sites may also differ in other tissues and developmental time points  <cit> , which could alter the relevance of hnf4α-alu elements.

CONCLUSIONS
the ~ <dig>  million hnf4α binding sites in ~ <dig>  alu elements in the human genome has the potential to affect the expression of hnf4α target genes. therefore, it will be important to keep the hnf4α-alu elements in mind when investigating hnf4α function, especially when using non primates as models for humans and when investigating conditions, such as cancer, where there may be genome-scale alterations in chromatin accessibility. these results join the increasing number of reports of nr and other tf binding sites in alu or other repeat elements  <cit>  and support the notion that repetitive dna may be more than just "junk" dna.
