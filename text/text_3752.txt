BACKGROUND
agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease on dicotyledonous plants by delivering a transfer dna  region derived from its tumor-inducing  plasmid  <cit>  into plant cells at the infected site. bacterial factors essential for the t-dna transfer process have been studied in detail. the ti plasmid encodes a set of virulence  genes. a relaxase protein, vird <dig>  is one of these vir gene product proteins. the protein makes a nick at two 25-base direct repeat border sequences  that define the t-dna region, and releases single-stranded t-dna from the ti plasmid. vird <dig> remains covalently attached to the 5′ end of the single-stranded t-dna and the complex is transported into plant cells through a type iv secretion system  channel comprising mainly of proteins encoded by the virb operon. in parallel with the t-dna, effector proteins, such as single-stranded dna binding protein vire <dig>  are also mobilized into plant cells  <cit> . vire <dig> binds to the t-dna in the plant cytoplasm and is thought to protect the t-dna against nucleases  <cit> , and also ensures nuclear targeting of the complex by virtue of its nuclear localization signal  <cit> . after entry into the nucleus, t-dna is integrated dominantly into the nuclear genome in a process of dna repair via non-homologous end-joining   <cit> . alternatively, the dna repair machinery also mediates formation of complex extrachromosomal t-dna structures including circular t-dna  molecules  <cit> .

recently, to study the t-dna transfer processes after transport into host cells, host factors involved in the processes have been characterized extensively using the crucifer plant arabidopsis thaliana and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the host plant protein vire2-interacting protein  <dig>  binds to vire <dig> and acts as a molecular adaptor between vire <dig> and a nuclear import machinery importin α to help direct vire <dig> to the host nucleus  <cit> , although vip <dig> seems dispensable in agrobacterium-mediated transformation   <cit> . van attikum et al.  <cit>  investigated the recipient factors using yeast. their studies revealed that t-dna integration into the recipient genome requires the dna repair pathway of either nhej or homologous recombination . the linear t-dna is a substrate for integration into the recipient genome, while it is also a substrate for ligation between t-dna molecules or itself in plant and yeast cells  <cit> . they also demonstrated that the formation of circularized structures involves the hr pathway in yeast. genome-wide screens using a set of yeast nonessential gene deletion collections showed that chromatin modification by histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases affects amt strongly  <cit> . however, it remains unknown how host yeast genes contribute to the t-dna transfer process. compared with the donor bacterial factors, the host factors are not well characterized. one such factor is a component of cell surface structures that must be recognized by the t4ss machinery.

in this study, we sought additional host factors for amt. the donor agrobacterium strain used in this screen has an autonomous replicable t-dna that contains a yeast artificial chromosome  dna. the t-dna does not require integration into the recipient yeast genome, and it enables not only high efficiency amt  <cit> , but also minimizes co-cultivation time to 1 day, compared with the several days of incubation that are necessary for the integration type t-dna  <cit> . consequently, we identified four mutant strains with dramatically decreased amt efficiencies. two of these strains lack genes involved in dna repair and the remaining were mutated for genes that are essential to arrange cell surface structures. our results indicated that the dna repair genes are important to maintain the chromosomal type t-dna in the yeast cells, and that the integrity of the cell surface structures is required for high-efficiency amt.

RESULTS
identification of yeast chromosomal genes affecting amt
to find additional host factors that affect amt, we screened a set of yeast mutant strains for mutants defective in the ability to be transformed by amt. the donor agrobacterium strain eha <dig> was equipped with the binary plasmid pby <dig>  <cit> . pby <dig> contains a yac in the t-dna region. the t-dna in pby <dig> consists of the selectable markers ura <dig> and trp <dig>  autonomous replication and segregation factors ars1/cen <dig> and two telomere sequences. therefor the t-dna is not required to integrate into yeast genome and can greatly elevate amt compared with integrative type t-dna  <cit> . in an initial screening, yeast strains incubated with the donor strain on ab induction agar formed confluent ura+ colonies on sc-ura agar and the proportions of transformant colonies of each strain were confirmed visually. among the yeast knockout strains in the collection screened,  <dig> mutant strains showed apparently fewer ura+ colonies compared with the wild-type strain. previously, soltani et al.  <cit>  screened yeast genes involved in amt using yeast mutant collections and identified some genes. in our screening, the genes that they identified did not remain within the selected  <dig> strains. subsequently, we evaluated the mutants based on amt efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of ura+ cell number per output recipient cell number, because a large number of yeast mutants are hypersensitive to stresses and tend to die  <cit> . we selected mutant strains which showed an amt efficiency less than a quarter of the wild-type efficiency. as shown in table  <dig>  four mutant strains, namely, srs2Δ, rad52Δ, smi1Δ and erg28Δ, exhibited about 5– <dig>  % of the efficiency of the wild-type strain . srs <dig> and rad <dig> are involved in double-strand break  repair  <cit> , erg <dig> is important for ergosterol synthesis  <cit> , and smi <dig> is responsible for regulation of cell wall synthesis  <cit> . complementation tests certified that the reductions in amt efficiencies were caused by the deletion of each gene. the mutant strains with the corresponding wild-type gene on a plasmid prs <dig> recovered the amt efficiencies to levels comparable to the wild-type strain transformed with the empty vector .table  <dig> yeast mutant strains exhibiting low amt efficiency

erg28Δ is less sensitive to growth suppression caused by co-cultivation with donor cells
during co-cultivation with the agrobacterium cells, the growth of the wild-type yeast strain was suppressed 3-fold by the presence of the donor cells . two mutant strains, srs2Δ and smi1Δ, showed a similar tendency to the wild-type strain. however, the growth of erg28Δ strain was affected very little by the presence of the donor cells . input recipient cell number at the start of the co-cultivation largely affected amt with yac type t-dna . we hypothesized that the continued growth of erg28Δ mutant cells attenuates amt efficiency. actually, erg28Δ mutant showed an amt efficiency comparable to the wild-type in experiments that supplied a 4-fold larger number of input erg28Δ cells . in our standard amt experiments, 1 ×  <dig> of recipient yeast cells were added and the resulting ratio of the number of donor cells versus the number of recipient cells was 40000: <dig> at the start of co-cultivation . the recipient cell number increases during co-cultivation. even though erg28Δ cells grew more than the wild-type cells in the standard co-cultivation, the growth difference became negligible when the co-cultivation was started using 4-fold more yeast cells . thus erg <dig> gene is necessary for the high efficiency of amt but appears to be involved indirectly in the t-dna transfer process.table  <dig> effect of different recipient cell abundance on amt efficiency

lithium acetate transformation of the mutant strains
to investigate whether the mutations identified in this screen also affect different types of transformation, we applied the lithium acetate  transformation method. in this transformation, we used a plasmid pyac4-b, which is derived from pyac <dig>  cleavage at the bamhi site adjacent to the tel sequences produces linear yac form. we used circular and linear form yacs for the transformation experiments. as shown in fig. 2a, there was no significantly difference in the transformation frequencies between the linear and circular yac dna in the wild-type strain. when the transformation frequency of linear yac dna was normalized to that of circular yac dna, the l/c transformation ratio showed a value of approximately 100 % . although the mitotic stability of short linear yacs  is much lower than that of the circular ones of a similar size  <cit> , the wild-type strain was expected to maintain this linear yac to a detectable level in this transformation. indeed, the colonies transformed by the linear yac showed size variation, this result might reflect the characteristics of short linear yacs, which are mitotically unstable.fig.  <dig> lithium acetate transformation frequencies of yeast mutant strains. a yeast cells were transformed with either  <dig>  μg pyac4-b linearized by bamhi treatment or  <dig>  μg of circular pyac4-b. transformation frequency was defined as the number of transformants per μg dna divided by the number of viable cells after the lithium acetate and heat-shock treatments. b yeast cells were transformed with  <dig>  μg of pyac4-b or telomere-less plasmid pyac4-x. relative transformation frequency was expressed as the ratio of the transformation frequency obtained with linearized plasmid divided by that using circular plasmid. error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate assays. differences were statistically significant compared to the wild type strain by student’s t-test. **p < <dig> 



the smi1Δ and erg28Δ strains exhibited average transformation frequencies that were half that of the wild-type, irrespective of whether the yac dna was linear or circular, but the differences were not significant , thus macromolecule uptake in general does not look seriously sick. the l/c ratio of both strains was comparable to that of wild-type strain, demonstrating that the linear yac is also maintained in the both strains .

the srs2Δ and rad52Δ strains exhibited comparable transformation frequencies to wild type strain when using circular pyac4-b , however these strains showed significantly low l/c transformation ratio compared with wild-type strain . this result suggested that the two genes, which are responsible for dsb repair, contribute to the stability of the linear yac, but not the circular yac. to confirm the stability of the yac in the mutant strains, we also used telomere-less yac dna in the liac transformation experiments. pyac4-x lacks any telomere sequences, and hence is expected to be predominantly maintained only as a circular form in yeast cells. in the wild-type strain, the l/c ratio with the telomere-less dna pyac4-x was much lower than that with pyac4-b . this result suggested that telomere sequences of pyac4-b are functional, and linearized pyac4-b remains linear for a considerable time in the yeast cells. in the srs2Δ and rad52Δ strains, the mutants’ l/c frequency with pyac4-x was the same as that of the wild-type . these results support the notion that the two genes contribute to the stability of linear yacs.

amt activity for integrative type t-dna
to confirm whether the mutations would affect amt using integrative type t-dna, we used two agrobacterium strains carrying either of two binary plasmids, psdm <dig>  <cit>  or pbinu <dig>  t-dna of psdm <dig> contains the ura <dig> gene flanked by pda <dig> sequences, which allow integration into the pda <dig> locus on the genome of yeast strain by <dig> through hr  <cit> . because the t-dna of pbinu <dig> contains only the ura <dig> gene, the genome of the yeast recipient strain by <dig> has no homology with the t-dna and thus the t-dna integrates randomly by nhej. in the wild-type yeast strain, the average amt efficiency using agrobacterium strain carrying psdm <dig> was  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  and the efficiency using agrobacterium strain carrying pbinu <dig> was much lower  than psdm <dig> . in the srs2Δ strain, the efficiency of psdm <dig> was comparable or little higher than that of wild-type strain; however the efficiency of pbinu <dig> was 9 % of the wild-type strain’s efficiency . these results are consistent with the notion that mutation of the srs <dig> dna helicase causes not only a hyper-recombination phenotype  <cit>  and high mitotic crossovers  <cit> , but also reduction in the dsb repair process via nhej  <cit> . the rad52Δ mutant strain, which is deficient in the hr pathway, showed the wild-type transformation efficiency when pbinu <dig> was used, while the efficiency of psdm <dig> was much lower: about 5 % of the efficiency of the wild-type strain . the fact that the two mutant strains showed equal or higher efficiencies than the wild-type strain when using the integrative t-dna suggests that rad <dig> and srs <dig> are involved in t-dna modification processes after their entry into yeast nuclei, such as t-dna integration and maintenance of replicative t-dna.table  <dig> comparison of amt efficiency of wild type strain between replicating and integrative t-dna

fig.  <dig> effect of t-dna type and co-cultivation conditions on amt efficiency. a yeast cells were co-cultivated with agrobacterium eha <dig> harboring a binary plasmid shown in each column. the co-cultivation time was changed depending on each donor: eha <dig> , 1 day; eha <dig> , 3 days; eha <dig> , 6 days. b yeast mutant cells were co-cultivated with eha <dig> harboring pby <dig> for the durations shown the figure. relative efficiency was calculated by dividing the amt efficiency by that of the wild-type strain. error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate assays. differences were statistically significant compared to the wild type strain by student’s t-test. * p < <dig> , ** p < <dig> 



the efficiency of the erg28Δ strain was consistently low with both integrative type t-dnas , indicating that the cause of the low efficiency when using both replicating and integrative t-dna is unrelated to maintenance or integration processes of the t-dna. the smi1Δ strain restored amt efficiency when using the two integrative type t-dnas: its efficiencies were comparable or one half of the wild-type strain level . however, there is no report that smi <dig> is involved in dna repair pathways; thus, we speculated that changes in the co-cultivation conditions induce the restoration of amt efficiency. in this assay, we extended the co-cultivation time with respect to each donor strain to elevate the transformation efficiency. although we carried out the amt experiment with different co-cultivation periods using the same donor strain eha <dig> , the smi1Δ strain did not restore amt efficiency after a long co-cultivation period .

vire <dig> protein transport activity
agrobacterium transfers several virulence proteins to host cells in addition to t-dna via the t4ss. we carried out a protein transport assay to determine whether the yeast mutations also affect the transfer of the effector protein. in this assay, cre recombinase-vire <dig> fusion proteins produced in the agrobacterium strain are detectable when the fusion proteins are mobilized to yeast nuclei and act on the chromosomally encoded lox::ura3::lox sequence. subsequent removal of the lox flanked ura <dig> gene caused by cre recombination activity results in the formation of uraˉ and 5-fluoroorotic acid  resistant cell  <cit> .

for this assay, the lox::ura3::lox sequence was introduced into the wild-type yeast and the mutant strains, and then the yeast cells were co-cultivated for 1 day with an agrobacterium strain expressing the cre::vire <dig> fusion protein . the rad52Δ and erg28Δ strains showed comparable results to the wild-type and the srs2Δ strain slightly reduced the efficiency . conversely, the smi1Δ strain still showed a very low frequency  . this result suggested that the cell-to-cell interaction, including connection of t4ss machinery between the donor and recipient cell is inhibited by smi <dig> gene deletion, at least during a short co-cultivation period, such as 1 day.fig.  <dig> efficiency of vire <dig> protein transport from agrobacterium into the yeast mutants. the yeast mutant strains that contained lox::ura3::lox at the pda <dig> locus were co-cultivated with agrobacterium c58c <dig> harboring pri1724-s3ce <dig> , and then uraˉ transformants were selected on sc medium supplemented with  <dig>  % 5-fluoroorotic acid and 200 μg/ml cefotaxime. the relative efficiency was calculated by dividing by the efficiency of the wild-type strain. error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate assays. differences were statistically significant compared to the wild type strain by student’s t-test. *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> 



effect of dsb repair gene mutations on amt
rad <dig> has recombination mediator activity and promotes hr pathways, single-strand annealing  and double-strand break-repair   <cit> . in contrast, srs <dig> is a dna helicase, which acts as antirecombinase by disrupting the rad <dig> presynaptic filaments  <cit> . the two genes obtained in the screening are involved in dna repair pathways; therefore, we examined amt efficiencies of mutants which are deficient in different dna repair pathways, as shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> amt efficiencies of yeast mutants defective in dsb repair by replicative t-dna. yeast mutant strains defective in dsb repair pathways, nhej, ssa and dsbr, were co-cultivated with agrobacterium eha <dig> . error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate assays. differences were statistically significant compared to the wild type strain by student’s t-test. * p < <dig> , ** p < <dig> 



the amt efficiency was not greatly affected by mutations in the genes responsible for nhej and ssa. the dsbr pathway defective mutations, rad55Δ, rad57Δ and rad51Δ, showed half the amt efficiency of the wild-type. this result indicated that the genes involved in the dsbr pathway are important to achieve highly efficient amt. however, the decreases caused by these mutations were not comparable with that of the rad52Δ strain. this result suggested that rad <dig> has a function other than through the dsbr pathway that contributes to amt. in addition, the srs2Δ strain has a hyper-recombination phenotype  <cit> , meaning that frequency of dsbr is higher than in the wild-type strain. thus, one cause of the decreased amt efficiency in the mutant is not attributed to the deficiency of dsbr pathway: srs <dig> might also have an important function that is different from the dsbr pathway and/or requires a properly regulated dsbr pathway for amt.

effect of telomere-less t-dna in the mutant strains
a study of yeast mutant strains lacking telomerase indicated that rad <dig> is involved in telomere maintenance via ssa or break-induced replication   <cit> . to evaluate the replication ability of transferred yac type t-dna further, we constructed novel binary plasmids, pbym <dig> and pbym <dig>  the t-dna of the binary plasmid pby <dig> contains the tetrahymena telomere sequences that are located at both ends of yac, but which are within the t-dna region. in contrast, pbym <dig> has the telomere sequences close to the terminal ends  and 27-bp from the right border ) of the t-dna; pbym <dig> lacks the telomere sequences at both ends. transferred t-dna of pbym <dig> is expected to form a t-dna circle in the recipient yeast cell. rolloos et al.  <cit>  showed that the t-dna circles are formed in recipient yeast cells when they used some t-dna constructs that contained ars/cen sequence but not telomere sequences.

the combination of the wild-type yeast strain and the donor with pbym <dig> resulted in  <dig> -fold higher amt efficiency than that with pby <dig>  conversely, the telomere-less plasmid pbym <dig> reduced the efficiency to one tenth that of pby <dig> . the amt efficiency ratio between pbym <dig> and pbym <dig> showed a more than 40-fold difference. these results indicated the contribution of not only the presence of telomere sequences, but also their location at the extreme ends to maintain the linear yac type t-dna in yeast cells. unnecessary sequences located between the t-dna border and the telomere sequence might interfere with the formation of a functional telomere structure at both t-dna ends, which would explain why the t-dna of pby <dig> decreased the stability in the yeast cells compared with that of pbym <dig>  in each of the four mutant strains, the amt efficiency of pbym <dig> was lower than that of the wild type-strain and that using pby <dig>  the amt efficiency in the mutants was also decreased when using pbym <dig>  . these results indicated that the telomere sequence is unrelated to the low amt efficiency of each mutant.fig.  <dig> amt efficiency of the yeast mutants by telomere-less t-dna with and without telomere sequences. the yeast strains were co-cultivated with the donor strain a
agrobacterium eha <dig>  or b eha <dig> . error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate assays. differences were statistically significant compared to the wild type strain by student’s t-test. ** p < <dig> 



it is noteworthy that the results of amt with pbym <dig> were not consistent with the results of liac transformation using the telomere-less yac dna. when the linear yac dna lacking telomere sequences was introduced by liac transformation method, we could not detect significant differences in the relative transformation frequencies between the wild-type and the srs2Δ and rad52Δ mutant strains . considering these results, we concluded that these genes play a primary role in the circularization of transferred yac type t-dna molecule mobilized by the t4ss, but is not required for the circularization of the yac dna incorporated by liac transformation. this difference might arise from some state of each dna molecule entering yeast nuclei. for example, t-dna entering into yeast nuclei is in the single-stranded form, whereas pyac4-x molecules used in the liac transformation are in the double-stranded form.

structure of transferred dna in the wild-type yeast strain
we analyzed the t-dna structures of six yeast transformants derived from each of the wild-type, rad52Δ and srs2Δ mutant strains by southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequencing. total dna was isolated from these colonies and analysed by restriction digestion; ecori has two sites only in the t-dna region of pby <dig>  one site exists in the yac inserted in the t-dna and another site exists outside of the yac near the lb sequence . subsequently, the samples were hybridized with the ura <dig> and ampr probes. pyac4-b was used as a control, bamhi- or ecori-digested pyac4-b is a  <dig> -kbp linear fragment because the plasmid has a single restriction site for each enzyme. double-digested pyac4-b is separated into two fragments,  <dig>  kbp and  <dig>  kbp, respectively .fig.  <dig> southern blot analysis of yeast amt transformants. amt yeast transformants were obtained by co-cultivation with the donor bacterial strain eha <dig> . a schematic diagram of the reference plasmids pby <dig> and pyac4-b, and the t-dna region of pby <dig>  tel, tetrahymena telomere sequences. b total dna extracted amt transformants of the wild-type yeast , c

r genes . control dnas were pyac4-b , and pyac4-b digested with bamhi  and with bamhi and ecori  



t-dna products of two  of the six colonies derived from the wild-type strain were linear dna, whereas the t-dna of the remaining four  were circular, based on the following results. as shown in fig. 7b , digestion of the w <dig> dna sample with ecori enzyme formed two fragments, the pattern was consistent with the double-digested pyac4-b control. a single band was detected in the ecori-digested w <dig> sample, and it was suspected that two bands were overlapping . we speculated that the t-dna was elongated by insertion or fusion of any dna fragment into the rb side fragment after transfer to the yeast cell. transformation of competent e. coli cells successfully formed ampr colonies when treated with genomic dnas of the w1–w <dig> samples, whereas no ampre. coli colony appeared when exposed to the w <dig> and w <dig> yeast dnas. furthermore, pcr amplification using a set of outward-directed primers successfully produced legitimate products when the former four dnas were used as templates dna, while the same experiments with the latter two dnas failed to amplify a product.

the restriction patterns of w1–w <dig> samples were classified into two types. the w <dig> sample digested with ecori generated approximately  <dig>  and  <dig> -kbp fragments, which were the approximate sizes of the fragments expected from a self-ligation of t-dna rb and lb. digestion of w <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig> samples showed a single band that was shifted up compared with the uncut samples, suggesting that they comprised a circular t-dna with a single ecori site. from the w1–w <dig> transformants, the dna molecules representing t-dna circles were rescued and their border regions were sequenced. a comparison of the sequence surrounding the t-region revealed that the w <dig> t-dna circle indeed contains a junction between the transfer initiation nucleotide of rb, and the transfer end point nucleotide of lb . the t-dna circles of the other three transformants were formed as a result of transfer of the whole pby <dig> plasmid and intraplasmid recombination between a 378-bp direct repeat containing the pmb <dig>  origin. the sequences of surrounding rb region showed a perfect rb sequence connected with the vector backbone sequence and large deletion of 9-kbp by the recombination, resulting in deletion of the one ecori site .fig.  <dig> alignment of the junction sequences in the t-dna circles of yeast amt transformants. dna circles from the transformants were classified into three types. a t-dna with perfect rb-lb borders junctions, b whole pby <dig> plasmid, and c pby <dig> with a 9310-bp deletion via intra-plasmid recombination. nucleotide sequences derived from the rb are shaded in red, while sequences from the lb are shaded by blue. the recombination region between the two 378-bp homology sequences  is indicated in green, whose internal sequence is abbreviated. the schematic diagram demonstrates the recombination sites in pby1



structure of transferred dna in rad52Δ and srs2Δ strains
transferred dnas of amt colonies of the two repair gene mutants were also analyzed by southern blotting and nucleotide sequencing. the results indicated that the circular dna in amt rad52Δ colonies, named r1–r <dig>  and the amt srs2Δ colonies s <dig> and s <dig> are t-dna circles, which were the same as that of w <dig> . similarly, we showed that the circular dnas in amt rad52Δ colony r <dig> and amt srs2Δ colonies s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were pby <dig>  the whole plasmid was presumably complete pby <dig> because the southern blot profile showed two bands of 15-kbp and 6-kbp that are comparable to the plasmid, and the transfer initiation at the rb was not terminated at the lb and connected with vector backbone sequence . there were no dna circles formed via intra-plasmid recombination among the amt transformants of the rad52Δ strain. this observation is consistent with a mutant phenotype that is defective in hr. rolloos et al.  <cit>  and bundock et al.  <cit>  reported t-dna circle structures being present in wild-type and rad52Δ strains. our results showing the perfect border fusions and the transfer of the whole plasmid are consistent with these previous reports. the s <dig> transformant contained a pby <dig> variant that harbors a deletion caused by intra-plasmid recombination . the two mutant strains did not contain any linear t-dna derivatives.

discussion
the yeast s. cerevisiae has been used as a model eukaryotic recipient in experiments to study trans-domain horizontal dna transfer phenomena. trans-kingdom conjugation  is effected by donor bacteria harboring a wide transfer range conjugal plasmid and recipient eukaryotic cells  <cit> . previously, we screened the yeast gene knock-out mutant library for strains defective in recipient ability for tkc, and found that a series of mutants lacking vacuolar atpase activity have extremely low recipient ability  <cit> . in this study, we used the same set of yeast mutants to screen for low amt ability mutants. the vatpase and other tkc-defective mutants showed a normal amt recipient ability. in this screening, we found four low amt-efficiency yeast mutants: srs2Δ, rad52Δ, erg28Δ and smi1Δ. by contrast, three of the four mutants are able to accept a plasmid from a donor e. coli at the wild-type or comparable level  and erg28Δ mutant showed a quarter of the wild-type level. these data suggested that there are different limiting factors between amt and tkc in yeast.

smi <dig> protein is a regulatory protein that participates in the coordination of cell wall synthesis with bud emergence  <cit> . to date, there has been no report that describes its contribution to dna repair or recombination. the smi1Δ mutation leads to several cell wall defects, including those of bud sites, cell surface structure and its components . the smi1Δ mutant exhibited pleiotropic effects in this study. the mutant showed the low amt efficiency with chromosomal type t-dna and the low cre::vire <dig> accepting ability . however, as shown in fig. 3a, the smi1Δ mutation exhibited a wild-type level of efficiency for amt with the random integration type t-dna. we should not exclude a possibility that a small damage that give a subtle reduction in one phenomenon causes a perturbation over a labile association with the donor component and recipient cell surface target molecules. to reveal the reason why smi1Δ decreases the amt efficiency when using chromosomal type t-dna, further investigation is needed to clarify this result.

erg <dig> is responsible for synthesis of a yeast membrane lipid component, ergosterol. its defect causes a decrease of the lipid in cell membrane  <cit> . erg <dig> protein is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein that acts as a scaffold to tether an enzymatic complex for the formation of zymosterol and also interacts with several upstream and downstream enzymes  <cit> . this study showed that the influence of the erg28Δ mutation on amt was dependent on the cell number during co-cultivation. cell division of the wild-type and most mutant strains was affected negatively during co-cultivation for amt efficiency, by increasing cell number, whereas erg28Δ mutant cell division was unaffected by the presence of donor bacterial cells as shown in table  <dig>  when provided with a large quantity of cells at the beginning, congestion in the co-cultivation suppressed not only amt, but also cell division of wild-type cells in general. the erg28Δ mutant cells continued to grow despite the presence of the donor bacterial cells and the congestion , and thereby attenuated amt efficiency much more than the wild type strain . actually, the erg28Δ mutant showed an amt efficiency comparable with the wild-type strain in the experiments that supplied a larger number of recipient cells . thus, this gene is not directly involved in t-dna transfer process, but is required for high efficiency amt.fig.  <dig> schematic diagrams of possible roles played by erg <dig> gene and the two dna repair genes in amt. a during co-cultivation with the agrobacterium cells, cell division of the wild type yeast cells is suppressed by the presence of the donor cells, while, the erg28Δ cells continue to grow in the same condition. erg <dig> gene product has a role in sensing congestion environment, and then suppresses cell division. although wild-type cells can keep high amt ability during co-cultivation, erg28Δ cells continue cell division and hence reduce amt activity. when higher number of cells are loaded to co-cultivation, even wild type cells reduce amt activity and exhibit the erg28Δ mutant level of low efficiency. b chromosomal t-dna contains the yac encoding autonomous replication and segregation factors and telomere sequences. upon the entry into nucleus, the single-stranded t-dna  is converted into double-stranded t-dna  and starts to replicate as a linear replicon. the srs <dig> and rad <dig> genes act soon after t-dna entry for modification of the t-dna to stably maintain them as linear replicons and to circularize certain t-dna simultaneously. the linear replicon  is unstable in the srs2Δ and rad52Δ mutants, hence needs circularization of the replicon, although the two mutants have lower circularization abilities and result in the formation of few amt colonies



this study indicated that amt is affected seriously not only by rad52Δ, but also by srs2Δ. the lack of the srs <dig> gene is as deleterious in amt as the lack of rad <dig>  even though srs <dig> mutations enhance hr repair  <cit> . in fact, the srs2Δ mutant showed high amt efficiency in amt with the homologous integration type t-dna. it is likely that a special role in strand exchange by rad <dig> and a controlled  action among repair genes are important in amt. the importance of the hr repair gene rad <dig> in amt was already shown by van attikum et al.  <cit>  for the transfer of t-dna having sequences identical with yeast chromosomal genes, and by rolloos et al.  <cit>  for the transfer of t-dna containing autonomously replicating sequences. in contrast, the other mutants defective in dsbr through hr, such as the mutant of the reca homolog gene rad <dig>  exhibited only 50 % defect in amt, as shown in fig.  <dig> 

we examined the mutants based on their transformability by the liac method, using circular and linear forms of yac dnas. both types of dna resulted in similar transformation frequencies in the wild-type strain. the repair mutants rad52Δ and srs2Δ supplied with linearized yac dna exhibited apparently lower frequency than with circular yac dna . the linear yac dna via liac transformation and the t-dna via amt can either keep the linearity or form a circular molecule in wild type recipient cells as schematically shown in fig. 9b. previous studies reported lower mitotic stability of linear artificial chromosome dnas in yeast when the dna length is around 10-kbp  <cit> . partitioning of the small chromosomes into daughter cells is attenuated according to the literature  <cit> . indeed, in this study the wild-type strain given linearized yac dna produced various sizes of transformed colonies, while the strain provided with the circular yac dna produced even sized colonies . however, there was only a small difference in the transformation frequency of the wild-type strain between the linearized and circular yac dnas. the lower frequency of the two mutants suggested lower mitotic stability, hence the need for circularization of the linearized yac dna for stabilization, although the two mutations have lower circularization abilities and result in the formation of few transformed colonies. accordingly, every colony of the two mutants contained circularized yac type t-dnas, as shown in fig. 7c and d. the lower amt efficiencies in the rad52Δ and srs2Δ mutants suggested that an appropriate level of hr is important for t-circle formation . taken together, the results suggested that the linear yacs were unstable in the two mutants, and thereby amt transformants retained circularized yacs, which are stable, even in the mutants. paradoxically, however, the t-circle formation is stuck by the mutations. therefore, rad52Δ and srs2Δ mutants cause severe defect in the amt with pby <dig>  we concluded that these genes are required for the final step of the t-dna transfer process, such as integration into the recipient genome and the formation of t-circles. both processes are important in the stable maintenance of the received integrative or replicative type t-dnas.

rolloos et al.  <cit>  proposed a model for t-circle formation. according to the model, rad <dig> promotes mobility of t-dna terminals and helps ligation between the terminals by the strand transferase activity of vird <dig> and hence concatemer formation. the concatemers are then converted into smaller circles through hr. our analysis of the t-dna derivatives of pby <dig> indicated that t-dna is circularized in every amt transformant colony examined: the circularized molecules were monomers and no concatemers formed from t-circles were found. the result is reasonable, because, in general, ligation between the two ends of a single t-dna molecule might take place at a higher probability than that between different molecules at a low dna concentration. it needs to be considered that pby <dig> contains a centromere and therefore concatemer formation inevitably causes the problem of a multi-centric molecule. dicentric molecules are unstable because of their inappropriate distribution during mitotic cell division  <cit> . the same authors mentioned that dicentric molecules are still maintainable. the mechanism of how the hr pathway is involved in t-circle formation and the eventual linkage between the two ends formed, remains to be revealed.

in papers dealing with t-dna integrated in chromosomes and t-circles, t-dna repeats were often observed, and the repeats showed every type of topology between the molecules, i.e. rb-lb, rb-rb and lb-lb junctions . the authors suggested that replication of a transferred, single-stranded t-dna precedes the concatenation reaction, based on the fact that the topology is not unique but variable. partial deletions in t-dna with very high frequency deletions in the lb side were described in several articles  <cit> . liang & tzfira  <cit>  explained that the deletions take place at the replication step. their notions support the view that double-stranded t-dna is the substrate for integration and circularization events  <cit> . in contrast to the t-dna found in plants, no inverted repeat with rb-rb or lb-lb junctions was observed in yeast  <cit> . similarly, the circles shown in fig.  <dig> have very few or no deletions. we speculated that the transferred, single-stranded t-dna forms a circle in yeast cells upon the entry from the donor agrobacterium cells. the possible reaction at the early single-stranded form stage gives advantage to the linkage between its 5′ and 3′ ends and minimizes deletion. this hypothesis correlates with the characteristics of rad <dig> and rad <dig> proteins in that they associate with single-stranded dna  <cit> . by contrast, t-dnas integrated in yeast chromosomes exhibited deletions at the lb side boundary  <cit> . the latter t-dnas might be integrated after the replication reaction, like those in plants.

the different t-dna structures between the yeast and plant cells could be explained if we assumed that the terminal end ligation and circularization events occurs at different times between the yeast and plant cells. this might reflect the difference in major dna repair pathways between yeast and plants. in plants, nhej is the major repair pathway  <cit> , where nhej is carried out between double-stranded dna terminals, and thereafter, t-dna replication precedes integration into chromosomal dna. in yeast, the hr repair pathway is most active  <cit>  where rad <dig> and rad <dig> interact with single-stranded dnas. we assume that the hr factors bind to and protect newly received t-dna, and promote the association between their two ends and circularization.

CONCLUSIONS
contribution of not only rad <dig> but also the dna helicase/antirecombinase gene srs <dig> is necessary for the linear artificial chromosome formation and maintenance as well as for amt efficiency through the transfer. a sterol synthesis scaffold gene erg <dig> is important in high-efficiency amt, possibly by avoiding congestion. necessity of secured cell surface is confirmed as a prerequisite by the effect of the cell wall synthesis regulator smi <dig>  these data and resources made in this study would benefit further study in molecular level and development of new vectors.
