BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and it is also a major human pathogen. the self-limited carriage episodes represent the most common interaction between pneumococci and the host. however, in some cases, such asymptomatic interaction can progress to invasive disease
 <cit> . of the many factors influencing the interaction of the bacterium with the host, numerous extracellular glycosyl-hydrolases and carbohydrate transporters have been found to play significant roles
 <cit> . the sialidases or neuraminidases, which are able to cleave terminal sialic acid  residues present in o-linked and n-linked glycans, have since long received special attention as virulence determinants
 <cit> . direct interaction of the microbial sialidases with host glycoproteins resulting in exposure of additional attachment sites on host cells was the mechanisms most frequently found to be involved in virulence
 <cit> . recently such interaction was found to be directly involved in invasion
 <cit> . despite the impact of sialidases in pneumococcal pathogenesis, metabolic implications have received less attention, including the utilisation of sialic acid as a carbon source on the glucose-free mucosal surfaces
 <cit> . sialic acid has recently been described by us and others to act as a molecular signal for pneumococci, resulting in increased carriage and translocation of bacteria to the lung
 <cit> .

given the prominent role of sialidases in host-pathogen interaction, it is not surprising that pneumococci harbour three sialidases, two of which, nana and nanb, are common to all pneumococci and the third, nanc, is present in only 51% of strains
 <cit> . structural and functional analysis of the three enzymes indicated possible different roles. nana is a first-line virulence factor for sialic acid removal, the trans-sialidase nanb is involved in the metabolic use of sialic acid, and nanc has a regulatory role, being able to produce and remove an intermediate metabolic compound which also acts as sialidase inhibitor
 <cit> . the conserved nanab locus that comprises the genes between spg <dig> and spg <dig> in strain g <dig>  was identified as the cluster responsible for uptake and metabolism of sialic acid
 <cit> . in addition to the extracellular sialidases nana and nanb, the regulon encodes two abc transporters, one of which responsible for sialic acid and n-acetyl mannosamine uptake spg1589- <dig>  and the other  for uptake of n-acetyl mannosamine alone
 <cit> . in addition to the abc transporters the locus encodes a pts uptake system for glucosamine, and the remaining genes encode for enzymes involved in sialic acid metabolism
 <cit> . in vitro this operon was found to be the main cluster showing differential expression in pneumococcal opacity variants and was predicted to be composed of four predicted transcriptional units
 <cit> . during infection, the nanab operon was found to be upregulated in pneumonia and meningitis compared to growth in blood
 <cit> . much less information is available on the nanc operon, except for the analysis of the enzymatic function of the sialidase nanc
 <cit>  and its recent implication as an alternative system for the uptake of sialic acid
 <cit> .

the present work aims at performing a functional analysis of the operon in order to gain further insight into the metabolic regulation of this locus.

RESULTS
the nanab locus conservation in oral streptococci
as a first approach to elucidate the metabolic relevance and regulation of the different predicted transcriptional units of the nanab regulon, we performed a genomic comparison amongst related streptococcal species, including pneumococcal strain g <dig>  s. mitis b <dig>  s. oralis uo <dig>  s. sanguis sk <dig> and s. gordonii v <dig> . with respect to s. pneumoniae g <dig>  s. mitis b <dig> and s. oralis uo <dig>  these showed an identical organization for part of the locus including the neuraminidase a , the orthologs of the satabc transporter spg1589- <dig> and the genomic regions encoding the transcriptional regulator and orthologues of the enzymes involved in the first steps of sialic acid metabolism, i.e. n-acetylneuraminate lyase and n-acetylmannosamine kinase . in contrast to pneumococci these two species, s. mitis and s. oralis, did not possess the sialidase nanb, the second abc transporter spg1596- <dig>  and the pts system. in contrast to s. mitis and s. oralis, s. gordonii v <dig> and s. sanguinis sk <dig> did not possess any neuraminidases. interestingly both s. gordonii and s. sanguis still possess orthologs of the n-acetylneuraminate lyase, n-acetylmannosamine kinase and n-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase predicted to be necessary for metabolism of sialic acid . in addition, s. gordonii and s. sanguis possessed the transcriptional regulator and the orthologs of the pneumococcal spg1596- <dig> abc transporter. in contrast to s. pneumoniae, s. gordonii and s. sanguis possess neither the pts system nor the spg1589- <dig> satabc transporter. to check the amino sugar metabolism of these three different species of streptococci growth curves and fermentation assay on neunac and mannac were performed. the growth curves show that s. gordonii grows only in presence of mannac, while s. mitis and s. pneumoniae are capable of growth on both amino sugars . similarly in the fermentation assay only s. gordonii acidified efficiently the medium in presence of mannac, while both s. pneumoniae and s. mitis metabolised efficiently only neunac, with some acidification of the medium with mannac by the pneumococcus .

neuraminidase locus induction in s. pneumoniae
the putative regulator of the nanab locus spg <dig> contains a classical n-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and a sis domain, found in many phosphosugar binding proteins including transcriptional regulators binding to the phosphorylated end-products of the pathways
 <cit> . given the probable catabolic pathway of sialic acid , mannac-6-phosphate appears to be the most probably compound having a regulatory role on the expression of pneumococcal neuraminidase operon and thus possibly in sialic acid metabolism
 <cit> . therefore we analysed the growth curves and the expression levels of some key genes associated with the transporter systems in the neuraminidase locus. first we compared the growth in the presence of mannac as a carbon source of a un-encapsulated g <dig> derivative fp <dig> and two isogenic mutants devoid of the whole nanab locus and of the transcriptional regulator spg <dig> respectively . the growth curves showed absence of growth in the presence of mannac for both mutants, indicating that the nanab locus is essential for efficient growth of mannac and that the phosphosugar binding regulator spg <dig> gene appears to acts as a transcriptional activator. then we focused our attention on growth of the wild type strain in the presence or absence of mannac, preferred by us for the indication assays over neunac, as this amino sugar does not acidify the medium. in these experiments bacteria initially grew on residual yeast-extract derived dextran of non-supplemented cat medium  and continued to grow thereafter with a lower generation time of  <dig> min on mannac only . for gene expression profiling bacteria were sampled in early exponential growth , when growth was still due to the residual yeast extract-derived sugar . for bacteria grown on yeast extract derived sugar in presence of mannac, gene expression data showed a significant induction of the satabc spg1589- <dig> and spg <dig> pts transporters, and a non-significant induction of nana . we performed a second experiment that compared the influence of mannac at od590 =  <dig>  and  <dig>  on gene expression . this assay compared bacteria grown on yeast-derived sugar and mannac, where the first time point represents growth on yeast-extract derived sugar  and the second growth on mannac after termination of the other carbohydrates. growth on mannac caused a significant increase of transcriptional levels of all genes analysed . the values of mean fold changes were  <dig>   for nana,  <dig>   for spg <dig>   <dig>   for spg <dig> and  <dig>   for satc spg <dig> 

to evaluate the role of glucose and of the two amino sugars mannac and neunac in the regulation of the nanab regulon, we quantify gene expression during growth in the presence of these sugars. bacteria were grown in the presence of mannac  or neunac  and their gene expression was compared to that of bacteria grown with  <dig> g/l glucose alone . all genes of the nanab regulon showed a significant increase in transcription in presence of any of the amino sugars. the values of mean fold changes were: nana,  <dig>   in mannac and  <dig>   in neunac; spg <dig>   <dig>   in mannac and  <dig>  in neunac; spg <dig>   <dig>   in mannac and  <dig>   in neunac; spg <dig>   <dig>   in mannac and  <dig>   in neunac. interestingly the transporter spg1596- <dig> linked to the growth and fermentation of mannac was more induced by this sugar, while neunac had a significantly greater effect on the satabc spg1589- <dig> transporter, again in accordance with phenotypic data.

repression of the nanab locus in the presence of glucose
according to the presence of three cre sites within the pneumococcal neuraminidase locus, we observed a biphasic growth curve when bacteria grew on glucose plus mannac or neunac . to demonstrate that this phenotype was due to carbon catabolite repression, we investigated the transcriptional behaviour of the neuraminidase locus in the presence or absence of glucose in the medium. growth conditions used were as follows: mannac with and without glucose , neunac with and without glucose  and glucose as the sole carbon source as a reference condition . growth curve data show that addition of glucose to both mannac and neunac resulted in an initial growth on glucose as a preferred carbon source followed by a second slower growth phase, in which the amino sugars were metabolised. to assess glucose repression during growth on glucose gene expression analysis was carried out by sampling the bacteria at an od <dig> of  <dig>  . as shown in figure
4c, the over-expression of all genes of the nanab locus occurred during growth on mannac or neunac as the sole carbon sources , while it was completely repressed in the presence of glucose .

regulation of neuraminidase a production and activity by mannac
to assess the production of nana on the bacterial surface after induction of the nanab locus by mannac or neunac, we performed a cytofluorimetry assay. in these experiments bacteria were harvested at the late exponential phase. in this assay the anti-nana serum recognises also to a certain extent glucose grown bacteria . however in culture media with either mannac or neunac as the sole carbon sources, the number of nana expressing bacterial cells significantly increased reaching  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. differences in nana production between bacterial cells grown with either of the two amino sugars and control cells cultured in glucose or glucose plus mannac were statistically significant . for more detailed analysis a fluorescence assay for the detection of cell surface-associated neuraminidase activity was carried out to investigate the dependence of neuraminidase production upon the nature of the carbon source provided during bacterial growth . the amount of neuraminidase activity in cell samples containing  <dig> cfu/ml was clearly higher  in the presence of n-acetylmannosamine rather than glucose , indicating that n-acetylmannosamine is an inducer of neuraminidase production while in glucose grown cells neuraminidase activity is clearly repressed.  <dig> cfu of s. pneumoniae fp <dig> grown in the presence of n-acetylmannosamine yielded a neuraminidase activity equivalent to that of  <dig>  μg of purified nana, indicating that this strain produces a significant amount of neuraminidase in the presence of amino sugars. these numbers are such to propose approximately 100– <dig> enzymes per cell when bacteria are grown in amino sugar and only few enzymes per cell when bacteria are grown in glucose.

discussion
pneumococcal neuraminidases are the most studied surface located glycosyl-hydrolases due to their role in pathogenicity as factors involved in adhesion and invasion of s. pneumoniae to host cells
 <cit> . in addition, their role in the release of free sialic acid from oligosaccharides has been proposed as an important source of carbon and energy
 <cit> . more recently, the cleavage of sialic acid from o-glycans has been related to pathogenesis, by proposing sialic acid as a molecular signal to promote in vitro biofilm production and in vivo nasopharyngeal carriage and lung invasion by s. pneumoniae <cit> . in this context, the regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression are of importance. so far nearly all data on virulence and expression of the two loci containing neuraminidases has been carried out on the nanab locus only, since the d <dig> reference strain does not carry the nanc locus
 <cit> . the main finding on expression of the nanab locus reported its organisation in four predicted transcriptional units, of these the one harbouring nana and the one encoding for the enzymes of the sialic acid metabolism were differentially expressed in transparent and opaque pneumococcal colony variants
 <cit> . additionally the increased expression of this locus during infection
 <cit> , further underlines the importance of neuraminidases in the interaction of pneumococci with the host. it should be noted that most of the above work on pneumococcal virulence is done utilising strain d <dig>  which is unable to ferment sialic acid due to a frame shift in the neuraminate lyase of the nanab locus
 <cit> , a fact which apparently does not influence regulation of the locus and virulence of the bacterium.

we have recently shown that the two abc transporters of the nanab locus, and also the sodium symporter of the nanc locus to a lesser extent, are not only involved in sialic acid uptake, but also in the transport of mannac, which represents the first metabolic intermediate in pneumococcal neunac catabolism
 <cit> . in this work we focus our attention on the contribution of the nanab locus, since deletion mutants for the nanc locus had been shown not to influence growth on mannac and neunac during the first 18– <dig> hours of incubation, implying a limited or absent regulatory crosstalk between the two regulons
 <cit> . the two abc transporters were shown to be able to support growth on amino sugars, with spg1596- <dig> and spg1589- <dig> being the main transporters for mannac and neunac, respectively
 <cit> . in this work we have combined genomic information, gene expression and growth phenotypes to further clarify these data. when performing in silico analysis of the nanab locus we observed the presence of part of the locus in related oral streptococci. here we utilised this genomic information to strengthen the correlation between orthologous transporters and metabolic functions. s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, harbouring an operon including the orthologue of the spg1596- <dig>  were found to be able to efficiently metabolise mannac, but not neunac. to the contrary s. mitis and s. oralis, which are much more closely related to pneumococci, harboured a locus, in addition to all the metabolic genes, also encoding for a neuraminidase and the orthologue of the satabc spg1589- <dig> transporter
 <cit> . the finding that s. mitis can efficiently metabolise neunac and mannac, confirm that the substrate specificity identified for the pneumococcal transporters is generally well conserved in orthologues of related species
 <cit> . interestingly, all oral streptococci share the core part of metabolic enzymes of the operon, suggesting comparable capability to metabolise both neunac and mannac. these observations match earlier data that described detectable levels of metabolism of neunac in most oral streptococci, while sialidase activity could only be found in few species
 <cit> . amongst the oral streptococci, pneumococci carry a composite locus, probably assembled from the gene pool of related species. the association of the spg <dig> oxidoreductase with mannac metabolism and of two small hypothetical proteins  with neunac metabolism remains unexplained, as all necessary enzymes for sialic acid metabolism appear to be already present. the pts transporter, found to transport glucosamine, appears to be unique in pneumococci
 <cit> . the fact that glucosamine is the last metabolic intermediate in sialic acid catabolism may indicate a convenience for the bacterium in co-utilisation of glcn and mannac, even if it is not clear where pneumococci should feed on glcn, a rare sugar in the human nasopharynx, but of which on the contrary the pneumococcal cell wall is exceptionally rich
 <cit> .

when pneumococci grow on mannac and neunac as the sole carbon sources, the generation time is much longer than on glucose or on the yeast-extract derived carbohydrates of the cat medium, which is in accordance with previous data
 <cit> . growth on mannac  shows a profile with a change in generation time. in the case of growth on glucose repression of the whole locus indicates sequential utilisation of sugars. this is less clear for the growth on yeast extract derived dextran and mannac, where only part of the locus is induced with the exception of the predicted central transcriptional unit encoding the principal mannac abc transporter spg1596- <dig>  the data here presented thus do not rule out, that during growth on yeast derived sugars also mannac may be co-metabolised. the differential impact of regulation on the three operons is reminiscent of data on expression of this locus in transparent colony variants, where also the nanb and mannac-uptake operon is not involved in differential expression, while the other two transcripts are upregulated
 <cit> . the fact that both mannac and neunac are able to efficiently induce the operon is in accordance with our finding that the spg <dig> regulator acts a positive regulator, as documented by absence of metabolism in its mutant and also by its annotation as a phosphor-sugar binding regulator. since neunac is imported by an abc transporter, which does not phosphorylate during uptake, and is first hydrolysed to mannac before becoming phosphorylated , both amino sugars may equally originate the inducer of the positive regulator; probably mannac-phosphate.

the sequential utilization of carbon sources is generally regulated by carbon catabolite repression, and in bacteria it has been linked not only to metabolic use, but also to more general mechanisms involved in host-pathogen interactions
 <cit> . as in other gram-positive bacteria, also in s. pneumoniae carbon catabolite repression involves the catabolite control protein a  which regulates operons by binding to a specific operator sequence, named as catabolite-repressible element 
 <cit> . multiple cre sites were recently predicted upstream spg <dig>  spg <dig> and spg <dig> in the nanab locus
 <cit> , and array analyses proved the role of ccpa in its regulation and interestingly relief of ccpa repression shows much more pronounced effects on the “neunac-operon”  than on the “mannac operon” . the cre sites and ccpa-mediated regulation is in accordance with the transcriptional units described earlier
 <cit> . our data here confirm that glucose completely represses the expression of all three predicted transcriptional units of the nanab locus. the above gene expression data are also consistent with the neuraminidase activity assay on whole cells, which indicates twelve times more enzymatic activity in induced cells with respect to glucose grown cells. the repression of both neuraminidases and the intracellular enzymes for sialic acid metabolism had already been reported for a large number of viridians streptococci, which thus share with s. pneumoniae a strong effect of carbon catabolite repression on the loci responsible of neunac metabolism
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the data obtained in our study confirmed and demonstrated that,  pneumococci carry a composite locus, in part shared by related species, which is predicted to metabolise both mannac and neunac,  pneumococci could use both mannac and neunac as the sole carbon sources for growth,  uptake of mannac and neunac involved preferentially the spg1596- <dig> and the satabc spg1589-91abc transporters, respectively,  mannac and neunac could induce the nanab locus, which is subjected to carbon catabolite repression by glucose and  a quantitative neuraminidase activity assay allowed to tentatively quantify neuraminidases on the surface of pneumococci grown in amino sugars to numbers around 100– <dig> enzymes per cell. interestingly, some growth conditions were found to mimic the transcriptional profile observed for pneumococcal transparent colony variants, suggesting a metabolic influences on pneumococcal phase variation
 <cit> . still, the differential induction of the predicted transcriptional units by the two amino sugars, indicates that probably carbon catabolite repression and activation by the regulator act at different strength on the three transcriptional units. finally as already shown in oral streptococci
 <cit> , the amount of nana significantly increases and neuraminidase activity during growth on mannac or neunac, indicating that experimental conditions based on mid log glucose-grown bacterial cells may be biased in estimating the actual contribution of neuraminidases to host-pathogen interaction.
