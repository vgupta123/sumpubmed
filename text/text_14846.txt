BACKGROUND
research over the past two decades has greatly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms by which olfactory receptor neurons  detect and transmit odor information  <cit> . however, little is known if odor-elicited activity in the primary olfactory pathway is modulated before transmission to the olfactory bulb. it is evident that orns expressing the same receptor may transmit different patterns of signals to the same glomerulus under certain conditions. in vivo glomerular imaging studies show that the dynamic range of orn input into a defined glomerulus is larger than that reported for single isolated orns  <cit> . subsequent studies further demonstrate that orn input is responsible for, or partially responsible for, the diverse spatial and temporal dynamics observed in glomeruli  <cit> . these results are in sharp contrast to those from single isolated orns in which the dose-response relationships are typically saturated within a log unit  <cit> . the difference appears irrelevant to the techniques used. for example, the range of dose-response relationship was broad when patch recorded from a neuron situated in a sheet of olfactory epithelium  <cit>  or when single unit recordings were performed in the olfactory turbinates  <cit> . clearly, some important pieces are missing. in this study, i present data to demonstrate that impairment of gap junctions or altered assembly of gap junctions or hemichannels in orns modulates odor responsiveness and leads to changes in olfactory activation patterns in the olfactory bulb. my study suggests that coordination of neuronal activity between orns through gap junctions or hemichannels may constitute an important mechanism in modulating olfactory sensitivity and odor perception.

connexins are gap junction forming subunits that assemble into hexametric connexons or hemichannels. two hemichannels, contributed by adjacent cells, are docked at the extracellular loops to form intercellular gap junctional channels. these channels allow electronic coupling and/or passage of small molecules, including ions, nutrients, metabolites or second messengers between coupled cells  <cit> . gap junctional coupling can profoundly change electrical activity in orns since these neurons possess high input resistance. indeed, in orns the opening of one channel can induce generation of an action potential  <cit> . since one gap junctional channel formed by connexin  <dig>  could transfer about 50% of the steady state current generated by one cell to its neighbor  <cit> , a few gap junctional channels could substantially alter the electrical properties of orns.

gap junctions in neurons are critical for maintaining physiological activity in sensory systems. in mice, deletion of connexin  <dig> , connexin  <dig>  or connexin  <dig>  reduces response acuity or impairs sensory transduction in the vision system  <cit> . in the olfactory bulb, cx <dig> mediated gap junctional coupling contributes to mitral cell lateral excitation  <cit> . electronic coupling among mitral cells allows temporally coherent output from an odor-specific glomerular unit  <cit> . furthermore, a report from the same group shows that cx <dig> is involved in maintaining the amplitude and in generating long-lasting olfactory nerve evoked epsp in glomeruli  <cit> .

our studies have demonstrated expression of multiple connexins  in orns in addition to their expression in the olfactory bulb  <cit> . these connexins are heterogeneously distributed within the olfactory epithelium in regional and partially overlapping patterns. we postulate that gap junctional coupling between orns, or between orns and sustentacular cells, plays a role in modulating olfactory neuronal activity. however, in a follow-up freeze-fracture immunocytochemical study to visualize gap junctions in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, we did not identify gap junction plaques in orns  <cit> . this result diverges from our earlier studies where we used a combination of approaches including utilizing transgenic mice  <cit> . even though the negative results from freeze-facture studies do not establish an absence of gap junctions in orns due to its technical nature, it certainly casts doubts on presence of gap junctions in orns. one probable explanation for this discrepancy is that the number of gap junctional channels in orns is sparse and cannot be identified by freeze-fracture studies since non-clustered gap junctional channels would not form typical gap junction plaques. however, a few sparsely distributed gap junctions, if present in orns, could profoundly modulate olfactory coding. to further address the possible involvement of gap junctions in olfactory coding, i used a dominant negative transgenic approach to specifically disrupt gap junctions in mature orns while gap junctions in sustentacular cells and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium and gap junctions in other tissues remain intact. the dominant negative transgenic mouse olfdncx expresses an olfactory marker protein  promoter driven dominant negative variant cx43/β-galactosidase fusion protein  in mature orns with minimal expression in sustentacular cells, basal cells and immature orns . this fusion protein has a β-gal reporter protein directly fused to the c-terminus of cx <dig>  <cit> . cx43/β-gal  interferes with endogenous cx <dig> during protein trafficking and thus decreases transport of cx <dig> to the plasma membrane  <cit> , limiting the formation of functional gap junctions  <cit> . transgenic mice that express cx43/β-gal driven by the human elongation factor-1α promoter die shortly after birth and display phenotypes typical of cx <dig> knock out mice, including reduced dye coupling and heart malformation  <cit> . this indicates that in vivo expression of cx43/β-gal can powerfully inhibit gap junctions. using olfdncx mice, i demonstrate that gap junctional communication in the olfactory epithelium modulates olfactory activity at the peripheral level and alters glomerular activation patterns  in the olfactory bulb. topological changes in odor maps due to gap junctional modulation could affect perception of odor quality or quantity.

RESULTS
expression of cx43/β-gal transcript and protein in the olfactory epithelium
i first used the reverse transcription pcr  method to investigate expression of cx43/β-gal in olfactory turbinates. i collected total rna of olfactory turbinates from olfdncx mice and their wild type  littermates. pcr amplification of reverse transcription products using a primer pair spanning the regions encoding for the two proteins fused in the construct  showed a single band at the estimated size in olfdncx but not in wt . an identical sample processed without addition of reverse transcriptase did not yield a product . the rt-pcr product from olfactory turbinates was subcloned and sequenced confirming amplification of the region bridging nucleotides coding for the c-terminus of cx <dig> and the beginning of the β-gal coding sequence.

to verify presence of the cx43/β-gal protein in the olfactory epithelium, i performed western immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry in adult mouse turbinates. western analysis using either a mouse monoclonal antibody against cx <dig> or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-gal revealed a protein band with molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda in olfdncx but not in wt .

cellular localization of cx43/β-gal mrna and protein in the olfactory epithelium
the olfactory epithelium is made up of three cell types: orns, sustentacular cells, and basal cells . about 80% of the olfactory epithelial cells are neurons and they are often found in columns with their cell bodies in close contact with each other and dendrites surrounding the nucleated portion of sustentacular cells  <cit> . cells adjacent to mature olfactory neurons are mature olfactory neurons, immature olfactory neurons and sustentacular cells. to determine expression patterns of mrna for cx43/β-gal, in situ hybridization was carried out in multiple coronal sections spanning the entire olfactory epithelium. the hybridization signal with antisense β-gal crna was observed in a band located in the middle of the olfactory epithelial layer , a pattern similar to expression of endogenous omp mrna that is expressed exclusively in mature orns . sense β-gal crna was hybridized under identical conditions yielding a faint background signal .

introduction of the transgene does not alter expression of marker genes or other connexins in the olfactory epithelium
i further used the real time quantitative pcr  method to investigate whether expression of cx43/β-gal induced organizational changes of the olfactory epithelium. i compared expression of a few marker genes of the olfactory epithelium and connexins expressed in the olfactory epithelium between olfdncx and wt using qpcr. qpcr is a sensitive method in monitoring cellular changes by quantitative measurement of gene expression. total rna of the olfactory epithelium from  <dig> individuals was collected under identical conditions and used for qpcr analysis. the primers used in the study are listed in table  <dig>  the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was used as the internal control and the data were presented as comparative threshold cycle   values . among the examined genes, omp, gap <dig> and cyp2a <dig> are selectively or predominantly expressed in mature orns, immature orns and sustentacular cells, respectively  <cit> . golf is a gsα-like g protein that is involved in the first step of olfactory signal transduction cascade  <cit> , and i <dig> is among a few olfactory receptors whose ligands are characterized  <cit> . in addition, i measured expression of cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig> and cx <dig> to see whether olfdncx exhibited altered expression of endogenous connexins. these connexins are expressed in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . measurement of endogenous cx <dig> transcription is possible in olfdncx using specific primers recognizing cx <dig> 3' untranslated region  since the transgene does not contain this portion of the gene. table  <dig> shows that none of the i <dig> receptor, omp, gap <dig>  golf or cyp2a <dig> mrna levels was different between olfdncx and wt after they were normalized to the housekeeping gene gapdh. these data, in addition to the electrophysiological evidence shown below, suggest that expression of cx43/β-gal in the orns does not have a significant effect on olfactory signal transduction machinery, the life span of a specific olfactory receptor, the population of mature and immature olfactory neurons, and the population of sustentacular cells. table  <dig> also demonstrates that cx43/β-gal did not alter expression of listed endogenous connexins either. this result correlates with a previous report that expression of cx43/β-gal did not stimulate expression of endogenous cx <dig> even though cx <dig> assembly was affected  <cit> .

olfdncx mice display altered electrophysiological responses to octaldehyde in ventral areas of the epithelium
underwater electroolfactogram  recording was used to examine whether electrophysiological responses to odors were different between olfdncx mice and wt. eog records the field potential generated by populations of orns in response to stimuli  <cit>  and is a reliable method to test olfactory responses to odors in various animals, including rodents  <cit> . first, i applied  <dig> μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine , a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that elicits responses by increasing intracellular camp. this drug consistently induced large olfactory responses where the magnitudes did not differ between wt and olfdncx in various locations , suggesting that cx43/β-gal expression in the olfactory epithelium of olfdncx did not result in a gross interference of the signal transduction machinery in orns.

because i suspected that modulation of odor responses by gap junctions would be of a relatively small magnitude, and because there was a large variation in the absolute magnitude of the eog responses to an odorant from mouse to mouse, i measured the response to one odorant normalized to the response of another odorant , as has been routinely done in eog recordings in rat  <cit> . eog recordings were conducted at ventral  and dorsal  positions  because an earlier study shows that cx <dig> is more abundantly expressed in position  <dig> than in position  <dig>  <cit> . i started with stimulation of benzaldehyde,  <dig> -cineole, and octaldehyde at the concentration of  <dig> μm. it appeared that olfactory responses to octaldehyde were consistently lower in olfdncx, compared to wt, when recorded from position  <dig> . indeed, when i quantified the response magnitudes of octaldehyde by normalizing to those of benzaldehyde, the normalized responses were significantly different between olfdncx and wt  . the ratios of cineole to benzaldehyde did not differ between olfdncx and wt in position  <dig> . in contrast, no significant differences were found between olfdncx and wt for eog responses recorded from position  <dig>  an area expressing limited cx <dig>  in the statistical analysis, p values were adjusted to correct for multiple comparisons by using the false discovery rate procedure  <cit> . table  <dig> lists normalized olfactory response magnitudes to  <dig> -dimethyl pyrazine, ethyl acetate and heptaldehyde recorded from position  <dig>  the olfactory responses of ethyl acetate and heptaldehyde were lower in olfdncx compared to wt, when they were normalized to those of benzaldehyde.

b, ** indicates highly different between olfdncx and wild type .

i further compared olfactory responses to octaldehyde between olfdncx and wt at various concentrations in position  <dig>  figure 3c shows dose-response relationships of eog responses to octaldehyde, when normalized to  <dig> μm benzaldehyde. the normalized response magnitudes were lower for olfdncx in the concentration range of 1- <dig> μm, indicating the differences of olfactory responses between olfdncx and wt are significant at low to moderate concentrations of stimuli. eog responses for olfdncx at higher concentrations  were smaller in magnitude than the responses for wt, but due to high inter-animal variability the values were not significantly different.

calcium imaging reveals that octaldehyde-responsive neurons are susceptible to gap junction uncoupling reagents
i used calcium imaging to monitor individual neuronal responses with or without the influence of gap junction uncoupling reagents in wt mice. calcium imaging was conducted on the surface of the epithelium in intact turbinates as shown in figure 3a. because the recording orns were situated within an intact olfactory epithelium, they were under optimal biological conditions they could possibly have in an in situ preparation. this in situ preparation allowed me to study cell-to-cell communication under physiological conditions. figure  <dig> shows examples of individual orns responding to odorants before and after application of the gap junction uncoupling reagent 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid  at  <dig> μm. at this concentration, bga itself induced negligible intracellular calcium changes . interestingly, at this concentration the effects of bga to odor-evoked responses were neuron specific. neuron a, an octaldehyde-responsive neuron, was responsive to  <dig> μm ibmx as well . after application of  <dig> μm bga, responsiveness of neuron a to octaldehyde was reduced to threshold levels . since the effect of bga is reversible  <cit> , neuron a regained its response magnitude to octaldehyde minutes later . phase 4a in figure  <dig> shows that responsiveness of neuron a to ibmx was not influenced by application of bga. the same applied to its responsiveness to  <dig> mm kcl  . these results indicate that bga does not interfere with normal physiological capability of neuron a because it did not interfere with ibmx- or high k-evoked responses. however, the responses to  <dig> μm octaldehyde observed in phase 1a were significantly modulated by the bga treatment. i speculate that the olfactory receptor of neuron a is only moderately sensitive to octaldehyde and gap junctional coupling with other neurons is necessary to sustain the response magnitude observed in phase 1a.

neuron b was an example of a different type of neurons. it was primarily a benzaldehyde-specific neuron since it responded well to benzaldehyde but weakly to octaldehyde. evidently, the olfactory responses of neuron b were relatively independent of gap junctions since application of bga had little influences on responsiveness to benzaldehyde or to octaldehyde .

these results were repeatable in multiple preparations. among  <dig> regions of interests  analyzed,  <dig> did not respond to applied odor stimuli and  <dig> died during imaging. in  <dig> octaldehyde responsive roi,  <dig> of them had response patterns similar to neuron a - application of bga rendered octaldehyde responses to threshold levels. about  <dig> octaldehyde-responsive neurons were insensitive to bga treatments. application of  <dig> μm of carbenoxolone, another gap junction uncoupling reagent, resulted in the same results as bga. none of the ibmx or high k responses was affected by gap junction uncoupling reagents. the effects of bga were observed to be neuron dependent. as shown in figure  <dig>  octaldehyde responses in neuron b were not affected by the bga application . these data indicate that for some octaldehyde-responsive neurons, coupling with other neurons is critical for maintaining olfactory response magnitudes. however, there are neurons whose actions are independent of gap junctional modulation.

octaldehyde-elicited odor activity maps differ between olfdncx and wild type mice
upon odor stimulation, orns transmit information through axonal action potentials to distinct neuropil structures in the olfactory bulb called glomeruli. in addition to activating mitral cells, synaptic transmission activates juxtaglomerular cells  surrounding each glomerulus. thus, the activity of surrounding juxtaglomerular cells reflects activation of a particular glomerulus. to study whether disruption of gap junctions in the olfactory epithelium affects odor presentation in the olfactory bulb, i constructed odor activity maps of octaldehyde in olfdncx and wt using a mapping tool developed in restrepo laboratory  <cit> . the odor activation maps were generated by scoring odor-activated glomeruli throughout the entire glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and then performing a series of computational analyses. determination of an activated glomerulus was made by measurement of odor-evoked c-fos mrna transcription in juxtaglomerular cells surrounding the glomerulus. more details of the odor activity mapping is described in the "methods" section and in previous publications  <cit> 

when mice were exposed to fresh air passing through a vessel with  <dig> % octaldehyde in odorless mineral oil, a moderate intensity stimulus known to be detectable by mice , odor-evoked c-fos mrna expression was elevated in juxtaglomerular cells in discrete areas. figure  <dig> shows the odor maps of averaged glomerular activation evoked by exposure to octaldehyde in wt  and olfdncx mice . the areas of maximal activation in the ventral zone  overlap. however, consistent with the decreased responsiveness of the olfactory epithelium to octaldehyde in the eog experiments, overall levels of activation were lower for olfdncx. in olfdncx, a total number of  <dig> ±  <dig>  glomeruli were activated, while the number of glomeruli activated by octaldehyde in wt was  <dig> ±  <dig>  . in order to explore regional differences in glomerular activation, i used a point by point mann-whitney test with confidence interval p values corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate procedure  <cit> . the areas within the black contour lines of figure 5c were statistically different. there were regions, particularly in the ventromedial, medial and caudolateral areas where the number of glomeruli activated by octaldehyde was substantially smaller for olfdncx compared to wt.

discussion
i have directly assessed the role of cx <dig> in orn activity by calcium imaging of individual neurons in an intact olfactory epithelium preparation and by characterization of olfdncx transgenic mice. my study has demonstrated that cx <dig> is involved in modulating responsiveness of orns to odors in the periphery and consequently affects odor activation patterns in the olfactory bulb. the data indicate that precise assembly of connexin protein subunits in the membrane is required for maintaining response magnitudes in subsets of neurons including a group of octaldehyde-responsive neurons. impairment of gap junctions or hemichannels by the olfdncx transgenic approach or by pharmacological gap junction uncoupling reduces olfactory responsiveness to octaldehyde. this is the first study showing that intercellular communication between mature orns and other epithelial cells  or hemichannel activity has functional consequences under normal physiological conditions. since the dominant negative cx43/β-gal protein is expressed exclusively in mature orns of olfdncx mice with negligible influences to developmental processes and maturation, or to gap junctions in other olfactory epithelial cells, decreased eog responses in olfdncx reflect the involvement of gap junctions or hemichannels in modulating olfactory activity at the peripheral level by spread of excitation to neighboring cells.

my findings cannot discern between the effects of cx <dig> gap junctions as opposed to cx <dig> hemichannels but the possibility remains that gap junctional coupling between orns exists as discussed below. in this case, orns would not be independent entities but rather certain subsets of orns form functional units in which individual activity is subject to modulation by the activity of neighboring orns.

transgenic dominant negative approach to study the functional role of gap junctions
because of technical difficulties in measuring physiological changes directly at the systemic level and unavailability of useful pharmacological tools that could be employed to interfere specifically with gap junctional communication in vivo, assessment of the functional significance of gap junctions is largely based on the discovery of disease-causing mutation in human connexins and germline targeted disruptions of mouse connexin genes  <cit> . in particular, accessing the function of gap junctions in orns is a daunting task because gap junctions are also expressed in other olfactory epithelial cell types  and because gap junctions are sparsely expressed in orns, making direct physiological assessment difficult. generation of olfdncx is valuable for studying the role of gap junctions in orn function. this dominant negative transgenic approach has advantages compared to germline targeted gene disruption, and would be complementary to conditional gene disruption. since i used the omp promoter to drive the transgene, the dominant negative cx43/β-gal is expressed robustly in mature orns, ensuring that the largest effect of the transgene on gap junctions occurs in mature orns .

dominant negative inhibition is achieved by producing an inhibitory variant that shares similarities in structure with the endogenous target. it is possible that cx43/β-gal interacts with connexins other than cx <dig> in mature orns. in fact, das sarma et al.  <cit>  suggest that cx43/β-gal is capable of interfering with connexin  <dig> , but not with connexin  <dig> in the hela cell line, where cells have the ability to form cx43/cx <dig> heteromeric complexes. studies have also shown that cx <dig> is able to oligomerize with cx <dig>  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether cx43/β-gal oligomerizes with cx <dig> because  <dig> nucleotides of the cx <dig> n-terminal are approximately 70% homologous to that of cx <dig>  our studies show that mouse olfactory epithelium expresses cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig> and cx <dig>  <cit> . using cx <dig> knockout mice whose cx <dig> gene is replaced by the β-gal reporter  <cit> , we find that cx <dig> is not expressed in orns . cx43/β-gal does not affect cx <dig> due to structural diversity. the inhibitory variant can potentially interfere with gap junctions of cx <dig> and cx <dig> in addition to cx <dig> according to gene sequence homologues. whether or not cx43/β-gal interferes with other connexins in orns would not undermine my findings that gap junctional communication plays a role in modulating olfactory responses at the peripheral level, although it is desirable to determine the specific molecular interaction of dominant negative inhibition in future studies.

dysfunction of gap junctions alters olfactory responsiveness in the periphery
my data indicate that olfdncx, compared to wt, have reduced normalized eog responses to octaldehyde, heptaldehyde and ethyl acetate, but not to cineole and  <dig> -dimethyl pyrazine . because the eog is elicited by the voltage drop induced by the sum of the odor-evoked currents from all orns in the neighborhood of the recording electrode, the eog is an integrated response: the more orns that respond, the larger the voltage drop recorded in the eog. the decreased magnitude in the eog of olfdncx mice reflects decreased current flowing through the paracellular junctions. this indicates that uncoupling of orns by dominant negative downregulation of gap junctions results in a smaller number of orns responsive to a particular odor and hence a smaller eog in olfdncx mice compared to wt.

the calcium imaging data presented here correlate with the notion that uncoupling of gap junctions in subsets of neurons reduces the number of orns responsive to a particular odor as uncoupling of gap junctions rendered responses to threshold levels in subsets of neurons . consistent with the sparseness of immunolabeled connexin puncta in the olfactory epithelium in mice  <cit> , not all neurons are under modulation of gap junctions. my results are in agreement with a report in necturus maculosus, where delay and dionne  <cit>  found that only a small fraction of olfactory neurons contained gap junctional channels. while a small number of coupled orns argues against a general role for gap junctions in modulation of orn function, its significance in olfactory transduction should not be underestimated. reduced olfactory responses at the peripheral pathway and altered odor maps suggest that impairment of gap junctions may have profound effects on olfactory perception.

because neighboring orns in the olfactory epithelium often express different olfactory receptors  <cit> , coupled neurons may have different responsiveness. then, what is the significance of coupling among different orns? since expression of connexins in the olfactory epithelium is less abundant than that in the retina  <cit>  and zhang, unpublished), coupling among different orns might be at low strength, which is consistent with our computer simulation based on my data presented above  <cit> . low strength coupling synchronizes subthreshold or threshold activity of neurons by providing low frequencies of current flow through gap junctional channels. under these circumstances, coupling increases olfactory sensitivity. at higher concentrations, individual orn firing is stimulated by the cognate odors and is dependent on its receptor specificity. this mechanism would allow for increased olfactory sensitivity of odors without compromising odor quality discrimination.

low strength coupling of orns indicates that coupling sites are mediated by a small number of gap junctional channels. this provides a probable reason for unsuccessful freeze-facture identification of typical gap junction plaques in orns within the olfactory epithelium examined  <cit> . heterogeneous distribution of connexins throughout the olfactory epithelium and technical difficulties in sample preparation may be other factors for the negative results since the methodology itself prohibits it from providing a picture encompassing large areas and the freeze-fracture method is adverse to bony tissues. small amount of gap junctional channels may be also accounted for a low incidence of dye coupling  <cit> . ample data demonstrate that dye coupling depends on the nature of connexins, molecules of dyes, and the density of channels  <cit> .

influence of connexin hemichannels in olfactory perception?
recently, there has been an increase in attention to the function of hemichannels formed by connexins  <cit> . while hemichannels are inevitably present in gap junction expressing cells because gap junctions are formed after docking to newly assembled hemichannels in adjacent cells  <cit> , their opening, which becomes prominent under pathological conditions, could result in release of a series of biologically relevant signaling molecules such as atp, glutamate, glutathione, nad+, and prostaglandin e <dig>  <cit> . hemichannels made by cx <dig> or structurally related connexins, if presented in mature orns, will be impaired in olfdncx. my calcium imaging data presented here  suggest presence of gap junctional coupling in orns because application of gap junction uncoupling reagents reduced intracellular . alternatively, blocking of hemichannels with bga or carbenoxolone would have led to opposite results.

under normal physiological conditions, the newly formed hemichannels are in closed states before forming gap junctions. an elegant dual-patch recording showed that in neonatal rat heart cells channel opening followed formation of gap junctions  <cit> . studies in the mammalian cell lines and xenopus oocytes demonstrate that opening of hemichannels made by various connexins requires strong depolarization  or removal of extracellular calcium . subthreshold cellular insults or acute pathological threatening conditions may also lead to opening of hemichannels  <cit> . on the other hand, physiological significance of neurotransmitter release through hemichannels in retinal horizontal cells is proposed  <cit> . in taste cells, atp release through pannexin hemichannels is critical for communication to presynaptic cells  <cit> . if hemichannels made of cx <dig> or related connexins release atp, paracellular atp could influence neighboring orn activity as application of atp to orns modulates neuronal responses  <cit> . in this study, the data from olfdncx mice do not allow me to discern efforts between gap junctions and hemichannels. future studies will explore potential roles of hemichannels by continuously working with olfdncx mice.

disruption of gap junctions may affect odor activity maps
in olfdncx, regions in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb that were activated by octaldehyde  covered a smaller area than domains in wt . this observation indicates that electrical coupling through gap junctions results in activation of a larger number of glomeruli, implying that orns expressing different receptors  are coupled through gap junctions. this inference agrees with my interpretation of the calcium imaging data presented here , with my interpretation of the implications of the eog study in olfdncx mice , with our earlier immunohistochemical studies  <cit> , with our modeling of electrically coupled orns  <cit> , and with modeling by others  <cit> . the octaldehyde activity domains that were more active in wt than olfdncx were located in the ventromedial, medial and lateral areas of the glomerular layer adjacent to the domains with highest odor-evoked activity . they receive axons from orns in ventral and lateral regions of the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . in normal mice, the olfactory epithelium in these regions expresses more cx <dig> compared to dorsal recesses  <cit> . this topographical relationship between the areas of the olfactory bulb affected by disruption of gap junctions and the areas of olfactory epithelium expressing high amounts of cx <dig> in wt mice further supports the premise that altered odor maps are associated with dysfunction of gap junctions in mature orns.

several studies indicate that glomerular spatial activity patterns participate in encoding odor quality and intensity, and that the topography of activation is likely ruled by the topographical relationship between orns bearing a specific receptor and their glomeruli in the olfactory bulb  <cit> . in addition, studies on the electrical activity of neurons responding to particular odors in the olfactory bulb  suggest that synchronized oscillations may also be involved in coding for odor quality  <cit> . this study shows that impairment of gap junctions reduces olfactory sensitivity and affects the topography of odor-evoked activity in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. the mechanism may contribute to the factor that odor-evoked sensory input generates long-lasting epsp in mitral cells  <cit> , as well as to the factor that glomeruli having high odor-evoked amplitude are those having relatively long response latency  <cit> . because gap junctions in orns affect synchronous firing of orns and affect odor activity maps in the bulb, gap junctions in the olfactory epithelium are likely to play a role in odor detection and discrimination.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated for the first time that intercellular gap junctional communication between mature orns and other epithelial cells  or hemichannel activity has functional implications in olfactory sensation under normal physiological conditions. i have provided evidence that gap junctional coupling modulates olfactory coding. the conclusion is drawn based on two independent studies: functional characterization of a dominant negative transgenic mouse olfdncx and calcium imaging to individual neurons situated in intact turbinates. data from these studies demonstrate that gap junctional coupling is critical for maintaining olfactory sensitivity in subsets of olfactory neurons. dysfunction of gap junctions in the peripheral pathway leading to reduced olfactory responses and altered odor maps indicates that gap junctions modulate quantitative and qualitative odor perception.
