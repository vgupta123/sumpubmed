BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells possess many unique properties, including long-term self-renewal and pluripotency, which is the ability to differentiate into all types of somatic and germ cells <cit> . previous studies showed that pluriopotency in es cells and early embryos depend on genes that are specifically expressed in pluripotent cells. these genes, collectively dubbed "ecats" for es cell associated transcripts, include transcription factors such as oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  oct3/ <dig> maintains es cells in an undifferentiated state in a dose-dependent manner <cit> , and sox <dig> functions synergistically with oct3/ <dig> in this process <cit> .

in addition to oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  we have identified a number of novel ecats using digital differential display of expressed sequence tag  databases. we found that nanog/ecat <dig> is a homeodomain protein essential for self-renewal and pluripotency in es cells and early embryos. overexpression of nanog allows for sustained self-renewal of es cells even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor  <cit> . another ecat member, eras/ecat <dig>  is a constitutively active ras-like protein that promotes the robust proliferation of es cells <cit> .

two possible mechanisms could account for the es cell-specific expression of ecats. one is the es cell-specific expression of transcription factors that regulate expression of downstream ecats. an example of this sort of trans-acting regulation is the activation of es cell-specific genes such as fgf <dig> <cit> , rex <dig> <cit> , utf <dig> <cit> , fbx <dig> <cit> , and nanog  <cit>  by oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  which can also activate their own expression  <cit> . alternatively, es cell-specific expression could be achieved by epigenetic modifications, such as dna methylation. for example, the cis-acting promoter and proximal/distal enhancer regions of oct3/ <dig> are hypomethylated in es cells, whereas they are heavily methylated in somatic cells and in trophectoderm lineages <cit> . deletion of dnmt3a and dnmt3b, which are de novo dna methyltransferases, results in global hypomethylation of genomic dna and partial resistance to differentiation in mouse es cells <cit> . a similar phenomenon was also observed when es cells were deprived of cpg binding protein <cit> . these findings indicate that dna methylation plays a pivotal role in gene regulation during differentiation and development.

germ cells are themselves neither pluripotent nor totipotent, but are able to transmit totipotency to the next generation. the rapid recovery of totipotency by germ cells upon fertilization stands in stark contrast to the inability of somatic cells to recover totipotency or pluripotency once they have differentiated. since ecats play important roles in totipotency and pluripotency, it is possible that they are differentially regulated in somatic cells and germ cells. to test this idea, we examined the expression and dna methylation of ecats in somatic cells and germ cells. we found that many ecats, including oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  were expressed in male germline stem  cells, which are cultured spermatogonial stem cells derived from newborn mouse testes <cit> , despite their highly restricted potential. furthermore, the regulatory regions of these genes were hypomethylated in gs cells and mature sperm. however, some ecat genes, including nanog, ecat <dig>  fbx <dig>  and fgf <dig>  were not expressed in gs cells. among these, nanog, fbx <dig>  and fgf <dig> have been shown to be direct targets of synergistic activation by oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  the octamer motif and sox-binding sites of these three genes were hypermethylated in gs cells. unexpectedly, we found that gs cells showed low oct3/ <dig> and little sox <dig> protein levels despite high expression levels of the corresponding mrna. we argue that the repression and dna hypermethylation of a small set of ecats, and the post-transcriptional suppression of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> contribute to the loss of pluripotency in male germ cells and the rapid recovery of totipotency following fertilization.

RESULTS
most ecats are expressed in male germline stem cells
to examine the expression of ecat genes in germ cells, we performed rt-pcr analysis . expression of the germline marker mouse vasa homolog  <cit>  confirmed gs cell identity. most ecat genes were expressed in gs cells but at different levels than in es cells. stella/dppa <dig> , tcl <dig>  sall <dig>  and rnf <dig> were expressed at higher levels in gs cells than in es cells , while gs cells and es cells expressed similar levels of ecat <dig>  ecat15-1/dppa <dig>  sox <dig>  sall <dig>  and sox <dig> . ecat15-2/dppa <dig>  eras, gdf <dig> , utf <dig>  esg1/dppa <dig>  dnmt3l, oct3/ <dig>  and rex <dig> expression was detected in gs cells, but at lower levels than in es cells .

repression of a small set of ecats in gs cells
although most ecats were expressed in gs cells, we could not detect expression of ecat <dig>  fgf <dig>  or nanog . in addition, we discovered that the es cell-specific variant of fbx <dig> was expressed in es cells, but not in gs cells or testis. in contrast, the testis-specific variant of fbx <dig>  which is transcribed from a different promoter, is expressed at high levels in gs cells and testis and but only weakly in es cells . quantification of transcript levels by real-time pcr confirmed that expression of nanog, fgf <dig>  and fbx <dig> was lost in gs cells .

dna hypomethylation of ecats that are expressed in gs cells
the expression of ecat genes in gs cells suggested that they might show similar dna methylation patterns in es cells. to test this possibility, we performed bisulfite genomic sequencing of the regulatory regions of ecat <dig>  ecat15-2/dppa <dig>  eras, esg1/dppa <dig>  and rex <dig> , all of which were expressed in both es cells and gs cells. in es cells, ecat15-2/dppa <dig>  eras, esg1/dppa <dig>  and rex <dig> showed hypomethylation, whereas ecat <dig> showed partial methylation. in gs cells, ecat15-2/dppa <dig>  eras, esg1/dppa <dig>  and rex <dig> showed similar hypomethylation to that observed in es cells. ecat <dig> had lower methylation in gs cells than in es cells. similar methylation states were observed in testis and sperm from adult mice. we also observed hypomethylation of the promoters of gdf <dig> and stella/dppa <dig> in gs cells .

in contrast, all examined genes were methylated in somatic cells, but to varying degrees. ecat <dig>  ecat15-2/dppa <dig>  and esg1/dppa <dig> were heavily methylated, while rex <dig> was ~70% methylated. the intronic region flanking the 3'-end of the first exon of eras was methylated in somatic cells, but to a much lesser degree than the esg1/dppa <dig> and ecat15-2/dppa <dig> promoters. we found that for each gene, there were no significant differences in methylation patterns between mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult kidney, and brain. retinoic acid-treated es cells exhibited methylation patterns that were intermediate between those of es cells and somatic cells.

in addition to the ecat genes, we examined the dna methylation status of germ cell specific genes mvh and preproacrosin, and a differentiation marker hoxb <dig> . the mvh promoter exhibited a methylation pattern similar to those of the ecat genes. the preproacrosin promoter was largely methylated in all cells and tissues tested. in contrast, the hoxb <dig> promoter was unmethylated in most samples except for kidney.

oct3/4- and sox2-binding sites of some ecats are hypermethylated in male germ cells
next, we examined the dna methylation state of ecat genes that were not expressed in gs cells. we found that the proximal enhancer region of nanog, which is regulated by oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  was hypermethylated in the male germline . this region showed only partial methylation in somatic cells. in contrast, there was no difference in methylation state between male germ cells and somatic cells in regions both upstream and downstream of the nanog proximal enhancer. these results indicate that hypermethylation occurs in a region-specific manner. moreover, we found that methylation of the nanog locus was lower in oocytes than in somatic cells, indicating that the methylation in germ cells occurs in a sex-specific manner.

hypermethylation was also observed in the fgf <dig> and fbx <dig> enhancers . the fgf <dig> enhancer, which is regulated by oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  was hypermethylated in gs cells, adult testis, and isolated sperm, but was partially methylated in somatic cells, including mefs, kidney, and brain. by contrast, the fgf <dig> promoter was hypomethylated in both male germ cells and somatic cells. the es cell-specific oct/sox-dependent enhancer of fbx <dig> was more methylated in male germ cells than in somatic cells, whereas the testis-specific promoter was hypomethylated in all cell types analyzed.

these data raise the possibility that oct3/ <dig> and/or sox <dig> binding sites might be targets of hypermethylation in male germ cells. to investigate this possibility, we examined the enhancers of oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and utf <dig>  which have previously been shown to be regulated by oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> . we found that the octamer/sox element of oct3/ <dig> was partially methylated in gs cells but hypermethylated in testis and sperm. similarly, the sox <dig> upstream enhancer, which has two octamer sites, also exhibited hypermethylation specifically in male germ cells.

however, the oct/sox elements of the sox <dig> and utf <dig> enhancers did not follow this pattern: the oct/sox element in sox <dig> was hypomethylated in all cells, whereas that of utf <dig> was partially methylated only in somatic cells. the oct/sox elements in non-ecat genes rif <dig>  nmyc <dig>  and tcf <dig> <cit>  also did not exhibit hypermethylation in germ cells either. the oct/sox site of rest/nrsf  <cit>  was hypermethylated not only in male germ cells, but also in somatic cells . these data demonstrate that some, but not all, oct/sox elements are selectively hypermethylated in male germ cells.

methylation state of the ecat cluster on mouse chromosome 6
three ecats, gdf <dig>  stella, and nanog, are clustered on chromosome  <dig> in the mouse and chromosome  <dig> in humans. this region contains other genes, including aicda, apobec <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  and slc2a <dig> in the mouse. we performed rt-pcr and found that aicda, apobec <dig>  and slc2a <dig> are expressed in both gs cells and es cells . since loc <dig> and loc <dig> both encode ribosomal proteins that share similar sequences with numerous different genes, we were unable to specifically amplify these two sequences and therefore could not study their expression in es cells and gs cells. nevertheless, our data indicate that this region is transcriptionally active in both es cells and gs cells, with the exception of nanog, which is not expressed in gs cells.

we next studied the methylation state of this region . we found that the male germ cell-specific hypermethylation was specific to nanog in this region. the other genes examined were hypomethylated in gs cells, testis, and sperm. by contrast, all the genes in this region were common in low methylation levels in es cells. most of them were more methylated in somatic cells, except for apobec <dig> and slc2a <dig> that showed hypomethylation in all tissues and cells examined.

the oct/sox sites are not occupied with oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> in gs cells
to examine the effect of dna hypermethylation on the binding of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  we performed chromatin immunoprecipitaion. we found that the two transcription factors bound to the octamer/sox elements of nanog, fgf <dig> and fbx <dig> genes in es cells, but not in gs cells. . unexpectedly, the two transcription factors did not bind to the oct/sox elements of sox <dig>  utf <dig>  and rif <dig> genes either, despite their hypomethylation status in gs cells. western blot analysed showed that the amount of oct3/ <dig> protein in gs cells was approximately 1/ <dig> of that in es cells . furthermore, we could not detect sox <dig> protein in gs cells despite the abundant transcripts. this result suggests that gs cells possess a mechanism that either inhibit translation or degrade the two proteins.

discussion
in this study, we compared the expression and dna methylation state of ecats in es cells, gs cells, and somatic cells. we found that many ecats, including oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  are expressed in gs cells in spite of their restricted potential. furthermore, the regulatory regions of these genes were hypomethylated in gs cells. however, a few genes, including nanog, ecat <dig>  fbx <dig>  and fgf <dig>  were not expressed in gs cells. among these, nanog, fbx <dig>  and fgf <dig> have been shown to be direct targets of synergistic activation by oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  the octamer motif and sox-binding sites of these three genes were hypermethylated in gs cells. in addition, we found that gs cells express little sox <dig> and low oct3/ <dig> protein in spite of the high rna expression levels. these data indicate that repression and dna hypermethylation of a small set of ecats, and the post-transcriptional suppression of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> may contribute to loss of pluripotency in male germ cells.

germ cells must perform two contradictory tasks: on the one hand, they must transmit totipotency and pluripotency to the next generation. on the other hand, germ cells themselves must lose totipotency and pluripotency to avoid tumor formation, especially teratomas. since ecats play important roles in totipotency and pluripotency, it is likely that male germ cells maintain expression of ecats, in part by hypomethylation, in order to retain pluripotency. in mature sperm, global transcription is suppressed by heterochromatin formation, including the displacement of histones by transition proteins and protamines <cit> . thus, most ecats are probably not transcribed in mature sperm. nevertheless, we found that the promoter regions of most ecats were hypomethylated in adult testes and isolated sperm. presumably, this allows rapid activation of ecat expression following fertilization.

our data showed that the binding sites of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> in some genes were specifically hypermethylated in the male germline, possibly resulting in loss of pluripotency in male germ cells. nanog may play an essential role in this process. nanog expression is restricted to pluripotent cells, such as es cells, ec cells, eg cells, and mgs cells in vitro, and the icm and pgcs in vivo <cit> . loss of nanog expression leads to loss of pluripotency, whereas overexpression actively promotes pluripotency <cit> . nanog expression is not observed in germ cells after they settle in the genital ridge, in either sex <cit> . by contrast, some reports have indicated that germ cell tumors in human testes ectopically express nanog <cit> . it is likely that in order for pluripotent epiblast cells to committ the unipotent germline stem cell fate, target genes of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> must be repressed by dna hypermethylation. upon fertilization, male pronucleus undergoes active dna demethylation, and thus erases the hypermethylation of the oct/sox sites <cit> .

in addition to dna hypermethylation in the octamer/sox elements, we found that oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> themselves are regulated at protein levels. although sox <dig> mrna is abundant in gs cells, we could not detect sox <dig> protein. oct <dig> protein also showed a lower protein level than the mrna level in gs cells. thus the expressions of ecats in gs cells are suppressed not only by dna hypermethylation, but also by suppressed protein expression of sox <dig> and oct3/ <dig> 

an open question is what mechanisms lead to hypermethylation of the octamer/sox elements. we observed germ cell-specific hypermethylation of the octamer/sox element of fbx <dig>  fgf <dig>  nanog, and oct3/ <dig> and of the two pou-binding sites of sox <dig> . however, dna methylation was not observed for the octamer/sox elements of utf <dig> and sox <dig> or the rox <dig> and oct3/4-binding site of rex <dig> . previous studies provide some clues to help explain this discrepancy. it was shown by gel-mobility shift assay that heterodimers of oct <dig> or oct <dig> and sox <dig> can bind in vitro to oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> binding sites in fgf <dig> but not in utf <dig>  due to differences in the dna sequences <cit> . this suggests that differential binding stringency of octamer/sox elements affects the recruitment of protein complexes. thus, properties intrinsic to individual octamer/sox elements might determine whether or not they are recognized by different protein complexes, including dna methyltransferases. however, further studies are required to uncover the precise mechanism of selective hypermethylation in male germ cells.

notably, the clustered distribution of dna methylation in the nanog locus suggests that waves of dna methylation may spread out in both directions from "methylation centers." during tumorgenesis, an initial "seeding" methylation event is known to induce hypermethylation in cpg islands <cit> . the "methylation center" regions in the nanog locus might similarly function as physiological methylation "seeding" sites. we could not find any obvious protein binding sites commonly to these regions, but it is possible that proteins bind these regions and regulate chromosome structure and transcription. recent studies have revealed that a nuclear structure known as a chromatin loop is associated with gene expression. satb <dig>  a nuclear protein that binds to at-rich sequences, forms cage-like networks and regulates gene expression in higher order chromatin structures in lymphocytes <cit> . mecp <dig>  which binds methylated cpg sequences, regulates the silent chromatin loop in the dlx5-dlx <dig> locus, with expression of dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> elevated in the brains of mecp2-deficient mice <cit> . these chromatin loop binding proteins are potential candidates for regulators of methylation centers.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we examined the expression and dna methylation status of es cell maker genes . in all ecats examined, the promoter region had low methylation levels in es cells, but higher levels in somatic cells. in contrast, in spite of their lack of pluripotency, male germline stem  cells expressed most ecats and exhibited hypomethylation of ecat promoter regions. however, a few ecats were not expressed in gs cells, and most of them targets of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  the octamer/sox regulatory elements were hypermethylated in these genes. our results suggest that dna hypermethylation and transcriptional repression of a small set of ecats might contribute to the loss of pluripotency in male germ cells.
