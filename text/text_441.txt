BACKGROUND
cytoplasmic male sterility , the maternally inherited trait of failure to produce functional pollen, exists in many plant species and has wide application for the production of hybrid crops. cms can occur at different stages during reproductive development. it is generally believed that cms is associated with the rearrangement of mitochondrial genomes, which, in many cases, is attributed to the generation of novel open reading frames   <cit> . some experimental evidence confirms the correlation between cms-associated orfs and the occurrence of cms. in some studies mitochondrially-targeted expression of novel orfs was shown to lead to male sterility or semi-sterility  <cit> , while in others it did not  <cit> . a probable interaction between orfb and the atp synthesis complex in cms has been demonstrated in sunflower using 2-d electrophoresis and western blot analysis  <cit> . however, the specific role of mitochondrial novel orfs in causing male sterility is not yet clearly established and better evidence that mitochondrially-targeted expression of orfs causes male sterility is needed. in particular, how mitochondrial factor regulates the expression of the nuclear genes involved in male sterility is poorly understood. is there any cross-talk between mitochondria and the nucleus that ultimately determines the abortion of pollen? if so, how do mitochondrial factors directly or indirectly halt the processes of pollen development, and through which pathway?

recently, many studies have focused on mitochondrial regulation of nuclear gene expression in higher plants  <cit> . this communication pathway from mitochondria to the nucleus is defined as mitochondrial retrograde regulation , and has been documented mainly in yeast and animals  <cit> . some abc model genes related to floral organ development, namely the nuclear mads-box tf genes, have been shown to be targets for floral organ homeotic transformation regulated by mrr  <cit> . in addition, several other nuclear genes have recently been shown to be retrograde regulated by mitochondria in some cms systems  <cit> .

previously, we isolated the cms-associated orf <dig> gene from cms stem mustard, brassica juncea,  <cit> . in the present study, we constructed transgenic stem mustard expressing the chimeric orf <dig> gene mediated by agrobacterium tumefaciens. these transgenic stem mustard plants exhibited male sterility. global changes in the expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes in transgenic stem mustard were examined using oligoarray analysis.

RESULTS
chimeric gene construction and transformation of stem mustard
we had previously isolated the cms-associated gene, orf <dig>  from cms stem mustard . to verify the function of this gene, a chimeric gene was constructed by fusing orf <dig> with a mitochondrial-targeting sequence derived from atp2- <dig> and amplified from tobacco . the orf <dig> gene was amplified from cms stem mustard and ligated after the mitochondrial-targeting sequence . the chimeric gene was then ligated to the transferred dna binary vector, pbi <dig>  driven by the  <dig> s promoter. the schematic structure of the chimeric orf <dig> gene is shown in figure 1-a. the constructs were then introduced into a. tumefaciens lba <dig> 

the transformation system for stem mustard established in our laboratory is based on a regeneration system from cotyledons with proximal hypocotyls . we used this transformation system to produce transgenic stem mustard plants incorporating the alien chimeric orf <dig> gene. candidate transgenic stem mustard plants were checked by pcr and rt-pcr  and  <dig> t <dig> plants were selected, all exhibiting male sterility. we selected one of these transgenic lines and obtained  <dig> t <dig> generation plants, which yielded  <dig> male-sterile and  <dig> male-fertile plants. we also used the orf <dig> gene as a marker to check that this gene was inherited and could be expressed in t <dig> transgenic stem mustard. the male-sterile phenotype was shown to be genetically transmitted to the t <dig> generation and associated with orf <dig> expression . all the  <dig> male-sterile t <dig> plants expressed the orf <dig> gene, and all the  <dig> male-fertile t <dig> plants lacked orf <dig> expression .

we used the chimeric orf <dig> gene with gfp expression to check whether this chimeric gene was targeted to the mitochondria. it was shown that the orf <dig> gene with the mitochondrial-targeting sequence  was located in the mitochondria, however, the orf <dig> gene without the mitochondrial-targeting sequence  was only found in the nucleus .

phenotypes of transgenic stem mustard
alterations to the phenotype were observed in transgenic plants in which the chimeric orf <dig> gene was expressed. the phenotype was stably inherited between generations. the vegetative growth of transgenic stem mustard was similar to that of wt plants, but their reproductive characteristics differed in numerous ways. transgenic plants exhibited: 1) 2- <dig> day delays in bolting and flowering time ; 2) the appearance of novel, petal-like floral structures at the basal part of the buds ; and 3) a lack of seed-set suggesting sterility, even though an episperm was observed at an early developmental stage in some siliques . when transgenic plants were cross-pollinated with wt pollen, seed-setting occurred indicating normal pistil fertility, and the retention of normal pistil function in transgenic plants . five types of aberrant flowers were observed in transgenic stem mustard: 1) flowers with six normal stamens ; 2) flowers having two stamens with pollen, and four without pollen ; 4) flowers with degenerative stamens devoid of pollen and with crooked pistils ; and 5) flowers with a closed corolla and a pistil on the outside . each transgenic plant bore all five types of aberrant flower. importantly, the phenotypes of aberrant floral organs in transgenic plants were shown to be identical with those of cms stem mustard . the expression of orf <dig> without mitochondrial-targeting peptides did not result in a cms phenotype in arabidopsis .

activity of pollen produced from transgenic stem mustard
however, some stamens from transgenic plants can still produce pollen and morphological screening, in vitro germination and in-situ pollen germination were performed to determine the activity of this pollen. the morphology of pollen from transgenic plants was altered . while most of the pollen produced by wt plants was susceptible to staining with ttc, some transgenic stem mustard pollen grains resisted staining with ttc, indicating that pollen activity of transgenic plants was markedly different . after  <dig> hrs of in vitro germination, pollen from wt plants was able to produce pollen tubes. however, pollen from transgenic stem mustard failed to germinate . after  <dig> hrs of in-situ germination on the stigma, fluorescence signals could be detected in pollen from wt plants, but this was not the case for pollen from transgenic stem mustard .

global gene expression patterns in transgenic and wt stem mustard
to discover which gene clusters in the mitochondria and nucleus are responsive to mitochondrially-targeted expression of the orf <dig> gene, we compared global gene expression patterns between wt and transgenic stem mustard using an oligoarray analysis. transgenic stem mustard genes that were either down-regulated or up-regulated more than two-fold, were selected and sorted according to their cellular components, molecular function and biological processes .

down-regulated genes
some examples of genes that were down-regulated in transgenic stem mustard are shown in table  <dig>  a number of mitochondrial genes, such as cox <dig>  cox <dig> and atp <dig>  were down-regulated to different degrees in transgenic stem mustard. at2g <dig>  a gene for a pectate lyase family protein, which is an enzyme involved in the maceration and soft rotting of plant tissue via degradation of the cell wall, was down-regulated more than 8-fold in transgenic stem mustard. at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> encode for cytochrome p <dig> family proteins which function as mono-oxygenases and are involved in hormone, phenolic, alkaloid, sterol and oxygenated fatty acid synthesis. at2g <dig> encodes protodermal factor <dig>  protein involved in early meiosis and shoot meristem development. at1g <dig> and at3g <dig> are male fertility related genes coding for proteins in the glycosyl hydrolase family, with anther-specific expression. at3g <dig> is a male-sterile gene, which encodes for male sterility protein  <dig> , and for a transcriptional factor gene reported to affect pollen development in arabidopsis. at3g <dig>  is a gene for a mip family protein, and is preferentially expressed in the surrounding sporophytic tissues of stamens. at4g <dig> encodes a sterol desaturase family protein, which acts as a mediator of fertility. genes for an abc transporter family protein , a calcium-binding ef hand family protein  and an alcohol dehydrogenase  were also down-regulated in transgenic stem mustard, as were some genes  that have been reported to be associated with pollen development. all of the down-regulated genes detected in transgenic plants are listed in supplementary data . the expression of  <dig> genes was down-regulated in cms mustard, while  <dig> genes were down-regulated in transgenic plants, only  <dig> of these genes being in common .

up-regulated genes
representative examples of genes that were up-regulated in transgenic stem mustard are shown in table  <dig>  at2g <dig> and at4g <dig> encode for glutathione s-transferase and superoxide dismutase, respectively, and maintain homeostasis in plant cells. at3g <dig> and at3g <dig> are thought to code for rna binding proteins. some kinase genes were up-regulated . at3g <dig> is a gene for homeobox-leucine zipper protein  <dig>  at5g <dig> encodes a zinc finger family protein. some genes related to metabolism were also up-regulated , as well as at1g <dig>  a gene for a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase family protein. all of the up-regulated genes detected in transgenic stem mustard are listed in supplementary data .

discussion
the precise mechanism by which mitochondria trigger male sterility is still unknown. it is well known that there is a relationship between novel orfs and the occurrence of cms, in which orfs play an essential role in disrupting mitochondrial function  <cit> . meanwhile, several recent studies using cdna microarrays have identified some nuclear target genes downstream of the pathway of cms occurrence  <cit> . however, the exact mechanism underlying the occurrence of cms, especially the downstream nuclear target genes and retrograde signaling pathway, remains to be exploited.

the evidence varies as to whether mitochondrially-targeted expression of novel orfs can induce male sterility or not. in some cases this leads to male sterility and in others to semi-sterility  <cit> . however, some mitochondrially-targeted expressions of such novel orfs fail to induce either male sterility or semi-sterility  <cit> . the failure of mitochondria-target expression of novel orfs to induce male sterility is probably due to problems of sub-mitochondrial location  <cit> , the expression period  <cit>  or the expression amount of orf protein  <cit>  in transgenic plants. in the present study, the reproductive phenotype of transgenic stem mustard was extremely similar to those observed in cms stem mustard . from these observations, we concluded that ectopic expression of the chimeric orf <dig> gene causes male sterility in transgenic stem mustard. and this could be attributed to direct mitochondrial localization of orf <dig> protein guided by a mitochondrial-targeting peptide. in transgenic plants, we observed reduced expressions of several mitochondrial genes related to respiratory complex, as caused by ectopic expression of chimeric orf <dig> gene, which may affect mitochondrial function, although we don't know how this happens.

functional genes specifically related to pollen development have been well documented till now, of which mutation of any of these genes causes failure of microsporogenesis or abortion of pollen  <cit> . in our study, we observed that many genes related to pollen development were down-regulated in transgenic plants. furthermore, many same genes in relation to mitochondrial respiratory complex and pollen development were also observed to be down-regulated in transgenic plants and cms line as well, although we couldn't conclude that these identical down-regulated genes were the causal factor of producing similar phenotype in transgenic plant and cms line from this study. it is unlikely that mitochondrial proteins alone could directly result in male sterility without a signal transduction from the mitochondria to the nucleus. such signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus, termed mitochondrial retrograde regulation, has been well described in yeast and mammals  <cit> , although it is less frequently reported in higher plants. among the clusters of expressed genes in transgenic and wt plants, we also observed several transcriptional factor  genes were induced by ectopic expression of chimeric orf <dig> gene, such as, homeobox-leucine zipper family protein , dna/rna binding protein and zinc finger family protein etc. these tf genes were reported to be involved in the regulation of developmental processes, the response of plants to environmental and redox regulation  <cit> . however, whether these tf genes are associated with mitochondrial retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression or not need to be further substantiated.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the mitochondrially-targeted expression of orf <dig> gene was capable of inducing male sterility in transgenic stem mustard. we proposed that the transformation of orf <dig> gene in stem mustard impairs mitochondrial function, and this response is signaled by the mitochondria to nucleus through a particular signal transduction pathway. how the orf <dig> gene functions precisely to induce male-sterility and its biochemical characterization remains to be discovered. in addition, further research is worthy of being investigate to explore the signal pathway of mitochondrial retrograde regulation and how nuclear target genes are responsive in order, expecially what is the primary receptor gene in the nucleus, if any.
