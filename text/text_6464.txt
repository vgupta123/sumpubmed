BACKGROUND
hiv- <dig> gp <dig> is a major target for neutralizing antibodies  and for this reason it is an important hiv immunogen to include in vaccine formulations  <cit> . however, the diversity of gp <dig> has proven to be a significant challenge to hiv- <dig> vaccine development. the structure of gp <dig> contains variable loops  which likely hide critical conserved epitope sites favoured by the nabs. furthermore, the crystallography structure of gp <dig> indicates that the protein is covered by carbohydrates which facilitates viral escape from nabs  <cit> . genetic variability in hiv-gp <dig> between groups m, n and o also affect the induction of nabs  <cit> . these factors complicate the design of an effective candidate vaccine against hiv.

previous vaccine studies focus on single hiv immunogens and although some of these studies show an increase in cd4/cd8+t cell immune responses, the immunogens used were not able to induce potent nabs that mediate sterilizing immunity  <cit> . the question remains: "can a single immunogen induce a broad immune response against a diverse virus like hiv". to address this, several studies have been performed. a single and double recombinant hiv- <dig> gp <dig> protein has been used as a candidate immunogen in a phase iii clinical vaccine trial. however, this vaccination was not effective to protect against hiv infection  <cit> . this lack of vaccine efficacy may be due to hiv diversity. while some single immunogens neutralize a few t-cell line adapted  hiv- <dig> strains, none of the animal model or clinical studies demonstrated a broadly cross-reactive immunity against hiv- <dig> primary isolates  <cit> . some studies demonstrated neutralizing antibody responses against hiv- <dig> primary isolates, however no measure of cross-reactivity was obtained as the strains of hiv virus used in the nab assay, contained the same hiv- <dig> gp <dig> as that used for vaccination.

hiv- <dig> subtype b is widely distributed throughout the world and is the most common subtype in north america and europe  <cit> . herein, we hypothesised that immunization with several  different wild type hiv- <dig> gp <dig> subtype b proteins would increase the breadth of specific antiviral immune responses. fourteen wild type hiv- <dig> gp <dig> subtypes b were amplified, cloned and the recombinant gp <dig> proteins were expressed in mammalian cell lines. golden hamsters were immunized with equivalent amounts of  <dig> vs.  <dig> vs.  <dig> distinct gp <dig> proteins and humoral  and cellular  responses to hiv- <dig> subtypes b, c and a/e were analyzed. although this polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity; the qualitative change in the vaccine  resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.

RESULTS
characterization and expression of hiv- <dig> gp120s
total rna was purified from syncytium and non-syncytium inducing co-cultures of  <dig> hiv- <dig> patients . amplification products corresponding to the full length of gp <dig>  containing constant and hypervariable regions were generated by rt-pcr. the genes were completely sequenced and identified as subtype b. the v <dig> amino acid sequence of the amplified gp120s was compared with v <dig> subtypes b, c and a/e, point mutations as well as insertion and deletion mutations were detected . in addition, the phylogenetic relations between the  <dig> different gp <dig> sequences and hiv subtypes b, c and a/e were revealed and genetic diversity between clones was identified . due to the limited number of nucleotides in the v <dig> region, the algorithm is applied to a longitudinal data set of the c2-v <dig> regions of hiv- <dig> gp120s using neighbor tree-maker in the fasta format. by this approach, epidemiological linkage was established between the hiv- <dig> gp <dig> clones and hiv- <dig> subtypes b, c and a/e. most of the hiv- <dig> gp <dig> sequences were clustered from the hiv- <dig> subtype b isolate mn. this isolate was epidemiologically linked to the subtype a/e isolate 93th <dig>  the results revealed no particular homology between gp <dig> clones and hiv- <dig> subtype c isolate 96zm <dig>  each gp <dig> variant was cloned into the pef6-myc-his vector for the expression and purification of recombinant gp <dig> proteins in vitro. stable cho cell lines transfected with the gp <dig> constructs selected for using blasticidine resistance and recombinant gp <dig> proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography. the expression of all recombinant hiv- <dig> gp <dig> proteins has been determined by western blotting .

immunization schedule
four groups of hamsters were immunized with different vaccine formulations as indicated in table  <dig>  in the first group , hamsters were immunized with mpl adjuvant alone. in the second group , hamsters were immunized with  <dig> μg of the recombinant gp <dig> protein purified from patient number  <dig> plus adjuvant. hamsters in the third group  were immunized with a mixture of proteins purified from patients # <dig> to # <dig>  and adjuvant. the polyvalent group  immunized with a cocktail of all  <dig> proteins . hamsters were immunized subcutaneously  on weeks  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  animals were rested for  <dig> weeks and then boosted at week  <dig> with the same combination of gp <dig> proteins. antibody titers were determined two weeks after each immunization.

a total of  <dig> μg recombinant protein in  <dig>  mg of monophosphoryl lipid a was injected per animal.

the polyvalent candidate vaccine induces higher antibody titers against hiv- <dig> subtype b than other subtypes
in order to measure antibody titers against various hiv- <dig> gp <dig> proteins, plasma from immunized hamsters was collected two weeks after each immunization and analyzed by elisa. the plates were coated with hiv- <dig> gp <dig> subtypes b , c , and a/e  overnight at 4°c followed by incubation with serially diluted plasma and developed as described in the materials and method section. the first two immunizations elicited a low level of antibody response to gp <dig> proteins . however, after the third immunization, antibodies were detectable in all groups immunized with gp <dig>  as expected the control group did not produce an antibody response. the highest level of antibody titer was observed in hamsters that were immunized with  <dig> recombinant gp <dig> proteins. in contrast, the control group  did not develop detectable levels of specific antibody responses. eight weeks after the third immunization, animals were vaccinated again with respective recombinant gp <dig> proteins. results similar to the third immunization were observed against gp <dig> subtypes between the groups. the polyvalent vaccine group induced higher levels of anti-gp <dig> titers to mn and sf <dig>  than the subtypes c and a/e . these results demonstrate that the polyvalent vaccine induces a higher antibody response to subtype b than the single gp <dig> candidate vaccine.

measurement of neutralizing antibody responses in immunized hamsters
two weeks after the fourth immunization, sera were collected and nabs to hiv- <dig> strains were tested. unlike many research studies, to detect the real breadth and strength of candidate vaccines, we used different hiv- <dig> strains, to assay for nabs, from those, which were used in immunization. since some background was observed in the pre-bleed samples, the nab responses were compared with sva-mlv  as a background control for non-specific activity. the group of hamsters that received all  <dig> gp <dig> proteins showed higher nabs titres to the hiv- <dig> mn strain than the single gp <dig> , however, similar nabs titres were observed in the group immunized with a combination of four gp <dig> proteins . sera from immunized hamsters were further tested against other primary hiv- <dig> isolates but none of the sera were able to show significant neutralization.

the polyvalent gp <dig> vaccine induced higher t cell proliferation in immunized hamsters
the proliferation of cd4+t cells plays an important role in both humoral and cellular immune responses by expansion of antigen-stimulated b and cd8+t cells, respectively. a high proliferative immune response was observed to the gp <dig> protein isolated from patient # <dig> in all groups with the exception of the control group . however, to assess and measure the strength of the candidate vaccines, splenocytes from immunized hamsters were further stimulated with hiv- <dig> gp <dig> strains and subtypes that were not included in the vaccine components. splenocytes were cultured in the presence of hiv- <dig> gp <dig> proteins. two days after stimulation,  thymidine was added and sixteen hours later, cells were harvested and thymidine incorporation was measured. the groups b and c showed a relatively similar proliferative immune response. interestingly, the group of hamsters that was immunized with all  <dig> gp <dig> proteins showed the highest lymphocyte proliferative immune response  to subtypes b , c  and a/e , supporting the cross-subtype activity of th immune responses.

discussions and 
CONCLUSIONS
the antigenic variation of hiv- <dig> gp <dig> is a major obstacle for the development of an effective vaccine  <cit> . nabs are mainly directed against the v <dig> region of gp <dig> which plays an important function in the binding of virus to either ccr <dig> or cxcr <dig>  <cit> . however, antigenic hypervariability of v1-v <dig> regions especially v <dig> assists the virus in escaping neutralization  <cit> . interestingly, a single mutation in the v <dig> region, could change r <dig> virus into an x <dig> virus  <cit> .

it has been shown that mono-or bi-valent hiv- <dig> envelope vaccines are poorly immunogenic and induce a limited breadth of reactivity. although nabs have been shown to control some laboratory-adapted strains, these results cannot easily be extended to primary clinical hiv- <dig> isolates. in addition, induced nabs from single hiv- <dig> envelope studies lacked cross-subtype neutralizing activity and could not neutralize other strains of hiv except the strain contained in the vaccine preparation  <cit> . in an interesting study, zhan et al., showed that cocktail of  <dig> hiv- <dig> envelope in the context of dna vector, recombinant vaccinia vector and recombinant proteins is able to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in immunized macaques. vaccinated macaques showed lower virus titers and higher amount of cd4+t cells compared to unvaccinated animals after challenge with shiv <dig> p. in addition, four out of six vaccinated macaques survived  <dig> week after the virus challenge, suggesting that a multi-envelope vaccine may be an effective approach to control hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> .

to increase the breadth of the immune response against hiv- <dig> strains, ten hiv- <dig> strains that had a non-syncytium-inducing phenotype and four that had a syncytium-inducing phenotype were selected from a bank of clinical isolates. although  <dig> gp <dig> proteins may not maximize the immune response and may not represent all subtype b isolates; these results my provide clues regarding the capacity of heterologous hiv- <dig> subtype strains to induce antiviral immune responses that recognize other hiv- <dig> subtypes. the multivalent approach to increase the breath of the immune response against heterologous strains within a subtype could provide for enhanced vaccine protection within a geographic region.

sequence analysis from the structure of gp120s revealed that despite vivid antigenic differences between r <dig> and x <dig> isolates, the structure of their gp <dig> core is similar. the sequences of the hiv- <dig> strains were analyzed by multiple sequences clustalw alignment program and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor tree-maker. the evolutionary history of the cohort gp <dig> clones was compared to other hiv- <dig> strains from the same hiv- <dig> subtype or different subtype. phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all gp <dig> clones were derived from subtype b. gp <dig> proteins were expressed in the cho cells to produce a glycosylation pattern similar to the one observed in the native structural form of gp <dig> found on the virus envelope. gp <dig> proteins were poorly expressed in transiently transfected cho cells. to solve this problem, stable cho cell lines were created. the production of gp <dig> proteins were increased more than 20-fold in the stable cell lines, allowing for efficient protein purification.

it may be possible that a cocktail of hiv- <dig> gp <dig> proteins containing multiple epitopes will be able to maximize the breadth of immune response against hiv- <dig> compared to a single immunogen. in a recent study, several macaques were primed by dna encoding gp <dig> from subtypes a, b, and c and boosted with recombinant gp <dig> proteins. although strong cell-mediated immune responses were induced, a potent neutralizing antibody response was not detected in animals  <cit> . so far, limited polyvalent vaccine studies have been performed and none have measured immune responses against diverse hiv strains. on the other hand, an effective hiv vaccine may have to deal with not only multiple subtypes but with many strains in each subtype. it is interesting to note that the surface envelope in each hiv subtype has featured differences. for instance, hiv- <dig> subtype c has enormous genetic differences compared with the recombinant subtypes a/c. the question arises whether hiv- <dig> immunogens from one subtype will be effective against other subtype. leandersson et al., showed t-cell reactivity between gp <dig> immunogen subtype b with other subtypes in hiv individuals  <cit> . however, they did not detect the neutralizing cross-reactivity between hiv- <dig> subtypes. another concern in a polyvalent vaccine approach is that there are no studies regarding the synergistic or antagonistic effects of gp <dig> genes. it is possible that protein components in a polyvalent vaccine cocktail interact and compete with each other and consequently may inhibit or downgrade the response to some proteins.

due to high background in mice sera, we were not able to measure the neutralizing antibody responses in our previous vaccine studies, thus, golden hamsters were considered for measurement of the efficacy of humoral immune responses. cd8+t cell immune response was not studied due to non-existent labelled antibodies to hamster cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in order to analyze the binding antibody titre, plasma from immunized hamsters was collected and hiv- <dig> gp <dig> subtypes b , c  and a/e  were analyzed separately by elisa. group d, which received all fourteen proteins, showed higher mean igg antibody titer to hiv- <dig> subtype b isolates mn and sf <dig> in comparison to groups b and c. while results from binding assays do not predict neutralization serotypes, they suggest that antigenic subtypes may be related, but not identical, to the genetic subtypes. theoretically, an augmented number and amount of envelope proteins may enhance the control of viremia following hiv- <dig> infection through a number of immunologic mechanisms, including increasing the functional activity of b cells, promoted neutralizing antibodies, and cross-reactivity with various hiv- <dig> subtypes.

in this study, the candidate vaccines were able to neutralize only the hiv- <dig> strain mn and not any other hiv- <dig> subtypes. interestingly, the immunized group with fourteen-gp <dig> proteins subtype b induced a response similar to the group that received four gp <dig> proteins. therefore, it will be useful to evaluate the immunogenicity of each gp <dig> and interaction with any other gp <dig> protein in a non-human primate model. these results are similar to a previously published polyvalent study where the neutralization was restricted to the virus strains used for vaccination and the polyvalent vaccine was not able to neutralize any primary hiv- <dig> isolates  <cit> . lack of cross reactivity between nab results were also consistent to a recent study by cavacini et al., demonstrating no quantified cross-subtype antibody reactivity and neutralization between subtype b sera against subtype c hiv virus  <cit> . in another study, wang et al. showed that a polyvalent hiv- <dig> envelope protein approach is not able to induce neutralizing antibody responses against hiv- <dig>  however, a polyvalent hiv- <dig> envelope approach in the context of dna priming followed by protein boosting may be able to neutralize some of hiv- <dig> strains from different subtypes  <cit> .

hiv- <dig> patients are faced with low number of cd4+th cells in different stages of disease. an inverse correlation between gag-specific th cells and hiv- <dig> rna plasma virus load has been shown. the strongest gag specific proliferative responses were associated with lower viral load, while a high viral load was observed with weak response to gag stimulation  <cit> . here, lymphocyte proliferation assay was tested to determine activation of lymphocytes after encountering with hiv- <dig> gp <dig> proteins from different subtypes. a relatively high proliferative immune response was determined to subtypes b, c and a/e in the group of hamster that immunized with fourteen gp <dig> proteins subtype b. this group developed stimulation indices four fold or more above baseline against all subtypes. these results were in consistent with currier jr et al. that showed a comprehensive cross-subtype reactivity of cell-mediated immune responses between individuals with different hiv- <dig> subtypes  <cit> . in summary, the polyvalent gp <dig> candidate vaccine derived from subtype b was not able to neutralize primary hiv- <dig> isolates. however, a substantial proportion of cross-subtype cd <dig> reactivity was observed between the polyvalent group with hiv- <dig> subtypes b, c, and a/e.
