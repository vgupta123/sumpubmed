BACKGROUND
ca2+ and k+ are essential macronutrients and normally the two most abundant cations in plants. ca2+ plays a number of roles in stabilizing cell walls and membranes, and as a second messenger  <cit> . ca2+ is a key component in the signaling of developmental and environmental stresses, including cold, heat, drought, salt, uv light, and touch . cytosolic ca2+ levels increase in plant cells in response to abiotic stress, and with this increase, several mechanisms are simultaneously activated by calcium-interacting proteins, such as ca2+-dependent protein kinases, calmodulin, calmodulin-related proteins, calcineurin-like proteins, and calcium-binding ef-hand proteins . the number of genes whose expression is known to be modulated by ca2+ transients in plants is limited, and the mechanisms underlying regulation of gene expression by ca2+ signaling are largely unknown. increased ca2+ concentrations induce the uptake of k+  <cit> . k+ is essential for enzyme activation, protein synthesis, photosynthesis, osmoregulation, stomatal movement, energy transfer, phloem transport, cation-anion balance, and stress resistance  <cit> . low k+ status induces the synthesis of reactive oxygen species  and phytohormones, such as auxin, ethylene, and jasmonic acid  <cit> , whereas high k+ concentration induces the expression of k+ channel proteins and k+ transporters, and regulates stomatal conductance and nadph oxidase activity, thereby reducing ros production, maintaining membrane stability, and protecting chlorophyll structure in k+-sufficient plants under abiotic stresses  <cit> .

the species brassica oleracea is generally considered to include seven varieties with different morphological characteristics; these are cabbage , kale , broccoli , chinese broccoli , cauliflower , brussels sprout , and kohlrabi . cabbage is the most economically important member of the genus brassica and contains functional phytochemicals, such as phenolics, vitamins, and minerals, as well as glucosinolates  <cit> , and requires a relatively high concentration of calcium for normal growth  <cit> . localized ca2+ deficiency in cabbage leaves causes tip-burn, which is necrosis at the margins of leaves, bringing about serious economic losses . although it has been known that the occurrence of tip-burn is related to ca2+ deficiency  <cit> , there is limited information on the mechanisms of tip-burn or the relationship between ca2+ levels and tip-burn incidence.

transcriptome analysis provides an efficient means of constructing total expression catalogs, even in the absence of reference sequences, and of analyzing the relative abundance of individual rnas  <cit> . application of transcriptome analysis to gene expression profiling consequently resolved the transcriptional complexity of whole plants and specific tissues under specific environmental conditions  <cit> . currently available transcriptome data for b. oleracea is not abundant to study the mechanisms underlying plant deficiencies in essential macronutrients. most studies of the b. oleracea transcriptome have focused on genotype  <cit> , tissue- , or stress-specific  <cit>  gene identification. the mitochondrial transcriptome and micrornas  of b. oleracea have been reported, demonstrating mitochondrial genome evolution and an essential role of mirnas in biological processes, respectively  <cit> . to understand gene expression changes in response to intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations at the whole-genome level in b. oleracea, we compared the transcriptomes of three leaf segments  that show different levels of intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentration, from three b. oleracea lines. in this study, we focused on the identification of the genes differentially expressed based on intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations in tip-burn susceptible and tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale. these findings may pave the way for further understanding of features of tip-burn in cabbage, as well as in other brassica species.

RESULTS
distribution of macronutrient cations in b. oleracea leaf
the major macronutrient cations ca2+, mg2+, na+, and k+ were previously shown to accumulate preferentially in the leaf base  compared with the leaf apex  of tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbages under normal conditions  <cit> . we measured the concentrations of the four cations in the leaves of these two cabbage lines and in kale leaves for comparison . ca2+, mg2+, na+, and k+ accumulated to a significantly greater extent in the lb pieces than in the la pieces of kale ; these findings are identical to the earlier findings for cabbage leaves  <cit> . levels of ca2+ and k+ were generally higher by > <dig> - and > <dig> -fold, respectively, in lb than in la pieces; they were also present at higher levels in kale than in the cabbages . in contrast, the concentration of na+ was higher in tip-burn susceptible cabbage than in either tip-burn resistant cabbage or kale. this higher level of na+ in tip-burn susceptible cabbage could be explained by the na+/k+ antagonism high level of na+ inhibits ca2+ and k+ absorption  <cit> . however, no significant differences in mg2+ content were observed among the cabbages and kale .

cytoplasmic ca2+ levels were measured in kale leaf using a dye that fluoresces under visible light upon binding calcium and compared to our previous data for tip-burn resistant and susceptible cabbages  <cit> . as expected, cytosolic ca2+ concentration was significantly increased in the epidermal cells of kale lb pieces , and cytosolic ca2+ levels were higher in all pieces of the kale than in the corresponding pieces of the two cabbages. as a result, nine groups of leaf segments from tip-burn resistant and susceptible cabbage and kale, with the demonstrated relative levels of epidermal cell cytosolic ca2+ and k+, were sampled for transcriptome profiling.

rna sequencing and assembly
to analyze the induction of differential gene expression by intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentration, we generated cdna sequences from the la, lm, and lb pieces of tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbage and kale. from the nine cdna libraries,  <dig> million reads  were generated . after the removal of low-quality sequences  and short reads , we selected  <dig> , <dig> reads , retaining mate-pairs for assembly. a total of  <dig>  preliminary contigs were obtained from velvet assembly with average  <dig>  reads. those were grouped into  <dig>  contigs by mate-pair information . average length of the contigs was 1283 bp, and length ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. these contigs represented  <dig>  loci as putative non redundant genes, containing an average of  <dig>  isoforms  . the homology search annotated  <dig>   and  <dig>   loci of the putative non redundant genes by aligning them with arabidopsis thaliana and b. rapa proteins, respectively . these annotated loci covered  <dig> and 93 %, respectively, of a. thaliana and b. rapa proteins.table  <dig> results of read assembly of brassica oleracea cabbage and kale transcriptomes

ca2+ and k+ concentration-dependent candidate transcriptomes of b. oleracea leaves
the ca2+ and k+ concentration-dependent changes in transcriptome were measured by comparing the normalized transcriptome data sets with the transcriptome of the la piece of the tip-burn susceptible cabbage . loci  showing significant changes in expression levels were selected based on the two criteria, which “contained ≥  <dig> reads with p-value <  <dig> ”. an absolute value for the transcript level, reflecting an increase or decrease of more than 2-fold, was used for the analysis of differential gene expression. a total of  <dig>  loci did not have arabidopsis counterparts, and were considered b. oleracea-specific genes with regard to arabidopsis . among the upregulated genes, a large degree of overlap in expression was observed between tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale. specifically,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes expressed in la, lm, and lb pieces, respectively, overlapped in these two lines , indicating that genes differentially expressed by more than 2-fold overlapped in the leaf pieces with higher ca2+ and k+ contents. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the lm and lb pieces, respectively, of all three b. oleracea lines. of the down-regulated genes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> overlapped in the la, lm, and lb pieces, respectively, of tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the lm and lb pieces, respectively, of all three lines . shared overexpression of these genes might be related to differences in the intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations of the different regions of the leaves of b. oleracea.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing numbers of overlapping and nonoverlapping genes differentially expressed by greater than 2-fold in the indicated segments of tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbage and kale leaves. la, leaf apex; lm, middle of leaf; lb, leaf base



tip-burn related phenotype-specific genes expressed in b. oleracea lines
hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out on  <dig> loci identified as phenotype-specific genes expressed in b. oleracea . phenotype-specific genes were defined as genes with |log2ratio| ≥  <dig> in at least one of the groups, and accompanied by a |log2ratio| <  <dig> in the other groups. a total of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> with no arabidopsis homolog  were specifically expressed in lm and lb pieces of the tip-burn susceptible cabbages . together,  <dig> genes, including  <dig> na genes were expressed exclusively in tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale , indicating that these genes could be related to the trait of tip-burn resistance. the total number of kale-specific genes  was  <dig>  and  <dig> genes had transcript levels that were increased or decreased by more than 2-fold in all tissues  relative to tip-burn susceptible la, with  <dig> na .fig.  <dig> hierarchical cluster display of tip-burn related phenotype-specific genes. the color scale bar at the bottom of the figure indicates the maximum log <dig> values of selected genes. see also additional file 5: table s <dig>  class  <dig>  specific for tip burn-susceptible phenotype; class  <dig>  up-regulated in tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale; class  <dig>  specific for kale; class  <dig>  up- or down-regulated in all leaf segments compared to la of tip burn-susceptible cabbage



the  <dig> phenotype-specific genes were largely related to stress and transport activity, based on go annotation . in the gene ontology  cellular component, most class  <dig> genes were associated with the nucleus , golgi apparatus , and cytosol  , whereas the main cellular components associated with class  <dig> and  <dig> genes were nucleus , chloroplast , and plasma membrane . the dominant components for class  <dig> genes were the nucleus, plasma membrane, and mitochondria, accounting for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of genes, respectively. in the ontology biological process, genes associated with the developmental processes , response to various stimuli , and transcription  were prominently represented in class  <dig>  classes  <dig> and  <dig> were enriched in genes associated with response to stress , transport , and protein metabolism , suggesting that these genes are needed in the presence of higher concentrations of intracellular ca2+ and k+. moreover, the transcriptional response to intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentration was similar in cabbage and kale, showing the expression of genes involved in major biological processes and molecular functions. class  <dig> was enriched in various genes associated with plant developmental processes and stimulus response, represented by go terms cell organization and biogenesis , protein metabolism , and response to various stimuli  in the biological process ontology. among the go molecular function terms, the main functional groups in class  <dig> were associated with dna or rna binding , protein binding , and transcription factor activity . classes  <dig> and  <dig> showed identical levels of go term enrichment, i.e., nucleotide binding , hydrolase activity , and transferase activity . the molecular functions dna or rna binding , protein binding , and transferase activity  were represented in class  <dig> .

based on the results of go annotation of phenotype-specific genes, higher ca2+ and k+ concentrations were relevant to the expression of transport activity genes or response to stress genes . only one transport activity gene, with go term “ca2+ activated outward rectifying k+ channel protein”, was detected in class  <dig>  the transporter category was composed of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in class  <dig> and class  <dig>  respectively. a number of the transporters were identified in those groups, such as intracellular protein transporter, mate efflux family protein, sugar transporter, k+ transporter, vacuolar protein sorting-related transporter, abc transporter, atp/adp transporter, and other ion transporters. in summary, the class  <dig> and  <dig> genes were specialized for the expression of transporter genes and genes involved in ion signaling, compared to class  <dig>  nine transporters were detected in class  <dig>  including intracellular protein transporter, abc transporter, lipid transporter, phosphate transporter, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, and mg2+ transporter . the response to stress genes were classified into nine go categories . it is noteworthy that the  <dig> stress-related genes, including those encoding  <dig> heat-shock stress proteins,  <dig> disease-resistance proteins,  <dig> osmotic stress proteins,  <dig> light stress proteins,  <dig> cold-stress and salt-responsive protein, and  <dig> photoxidative stress-related protein were included in class  <dig>  in class  <dig>   <dig> genes related to response to stress were up-regulated, including genes shared with class  <dig>  and additional genes encoding  <dig> drought stress-related protein and  <dig> cold-stress-related protein. however, class  <dig> contained  <dig> genes encoding disease-resistance proteins,  <dig> encoding abiotic stress-related proteins, and  <dig> encoding heat-shock stress-related protein . in order to correlate these results with phenotype, we exposed tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbage and kale plants to temperature stresses and drought stress in two cabbages. tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale plants showed phenotypes that clearly indicated heat-shock, freezing, and drought stress tolerance compared to tip-burn susceptible cabbage plants . based on these results, we predicted that there is a correlation between intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations and tolerance of abiotic stress. basal transcript levels of genes previously identified as abiotic stress-response genes were higher in kale than in tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbages, and transcript levels were co-regulated in response to abiotic stress, as expected . three  of the tested genes showed lower basal transcriptome level in tip-burn resistant cabbage than in susceptible cabbage. however, the transcriptions of the locus_ <dig> and locus_ <dig> in tip-burn resistant cabbage were more increased by the drought or freezing stresses than in susceptible cabbage . consequently, the expression of the locus_ <dig> was expected to increase more by other stresses in same manner. our data show that intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations affected plant responses to environmental stresses by differential regulation of appropriate stress-induced genes.table  <dig> functional categories of phenotype-specific transport activity and response to stress genes expressed in tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbages and kale

profiling of gene expression based on increasing intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations in b. oleracea
we selected  <dig> genes that were up- or down-regulated in response to increasing ca2+ and k+ concentrations in the three leaf positions of the three b. oleracea lines . a total of  <dig> genes, after exclusion of the  <dig> na genes, was annotated based on homology to the arabidopsis genes, including  <dig> unknown genes, with the remainder being specific to the b. oleracea genomes. those genes were clustered hierarchically based on their expression patterns . only  <dig> genes were commonly upregulated in response to increased intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations in the lines as well as in the leaf positions. locus_ <dig>  was up-regulated to the greatest extent, showing the largest fold change , and was also the most highly expressed gene in the leaf position with the highest concentrations of ca2+ and k+, i.e., kale lb. a total of  <dig> genes were down-regulated in response to increasing ca2+ and k+ concentrations, and locus_ <dig>  was the gene down regulated to the greatest extent in kale lb. locus_ <dig> gene  was the gene most down regulated in all three leaf positions of tip-burn resistant cabbage compared to the susceptible cabbage .fig.  <dig> hierarchical cluster display of genes up-  and down-regulated  in ca2+- and k+-dependent manner. the color scale bar at the bottom of the figure indicates the maximum log <dig> values of selected genes. see also additional file 7: figure s <dig> and additional file 8: table s4



the selected up- or down-regulated genes were classified according to the gos cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. a total of  <dig> go ids were obtained for the  <dig> genes . in the go cellular component, the terms “nucleus”, “plasma membrane”, and “chloroplast” were enriched. the terms “cell organization and biogenesis”, “developmental processes”, “protein metabolism”, “response to abiotic or biotic stimulus”, “response to stress”, and “unknown biological processes” occurred most frequently in the ontology biological process. in the molecular function ontology, the terms “hydrolase activity”, “transferase activity”, “unknown molecular functions”, and various “binding” were enriched, accounting for  <dig>  % of genes in this ontology . go analysis showed that genes associated with the terms “unknown biological processes” and “unknown molecular functions” were enriched, accounting for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of genes, respectively . based on the go annotation, those selected genes were considered to be involved in regulatory metabolic processes or stress responses. the data obtained in this study will be informative not only for research on essential macronutrient concentration-related gene expression in b. oleracea, but will also be useful for the investigations of ca2+ deficiency disorders in related species.fig.  <dig> distribution of gene ontologies cellular component, biological process, and molecular function for the genes up- or down-regulated in response to increasing ca2+ and k+ concentrations in the leaf segments of tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbages and kale plants. asterisks indicate significantly enriched go terms were adjusted to p ≤  <dig> 



CONCLUSIONS
the major macronutrient cations ca2+ and k+ showed significant preferential accumulation in lb, compared to la, in tip-burn susceptible and resistant cabbage and kale. concentrations of ca2+ and k+ were more than 2-fold higher in both tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale than in tip-burn susceptible cabbage. analysis of changes in the transcriptomes of these plants in response to changes in ca2+ and k+ levels identified  <dig>  loci showing significant changes in the expression level. among these,  <dig> loci were identified as tip-burn related phenotype-specific genes. of these,  <dig> were specific for the tip burn-susceptible phenotype;  <dig> were specific for tip-burn resistant;  <dig> were specific for kale; and  <dig> were up- or down-regulated in all leaf positions compared to the la of tip-burn susceptible cabbage. the genes specific for tip-burn resistant and kale were largely related to stress and transport activity based on go annotation. tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale plants showed phenotypes that clearly indicated heat-shock, freezing, and drought stress tolerance compared to tip burn-susceptible cabbages, demonstrating the correlation between intracellular ca2+ and k+ concentrations and tolerance of abiotic stress with differential gene expression. we selected  <dig> up- or down regulated in response to increasing ca2+ and k+ concentrations in three leaf segments of the three b. oleracea lines. based on the go enrichment analysis, the selected genes were identified as participating in the regulatory metabolic processes or stress responses. this study provides information on the mechanisms of tip-burn and the relationships between intracellular ca2+ concentration and tip-burn incidence in b. oleracea, which will be useful for research on ca2+ deficiency disorders in other plant cultivars.
