BACKGROUND
a hallmark of angiosperm genome organization is gene redundancy. redundant genome segments have been identified in the composition and architecture of modern-day angiosperm genomes suggesting one or more ancient genome duplication events  <cit> . this has led to considerable interest in the evolution of the resulting duplicated genes. a key issue has been the identification of factors that enhance the retention of duplicate gene pairs and their potential for adaptive diversification or subfunctionalization . mechanisms such as the maintenance of gene dosage and epistatic interactions  <cit>  and epigenetically regulated expression subfunctionalization  <cit>  have been implicated in aiding duplicate gene retention. these processes describe mechanisms of retention for ancient duplicate genes and naturally lead to questions about the evolutionary behavior of duplicate gene pairs in more recently formed polyploid species.

members of the cotton genus provide a phylogenetic framework to study the evolution of duplicate gene expression in recent polyploids because five diverse allopolyploid species are thought to have diverged from a single allopolyploidization event  <cit> , and models of the ancestral diploid progenitor species  have been identified . in addition, extensive genomic resources, such as comprehensive expressed sequence tag  libraries  <cit> , microarray platforms  <cit> , and bac libraries  <cit>  have greatly extended research capabilities. synthesis of an f <dig> hybrid, combining the a- and d-genome diploid model species, offers the opportunity to untangle the effects of genomic merger from those arising from genome doubling and subsequent evolutionary change. this phylogenetic framework facilitates the study of gene expression from co-resident genomes on two temporal scales, from the onset of hybridization to a longer-term evolutionary timeframe encompassed by the natural allotetraploid species.

adams et al  <cit>  demonstrated that homoeolog expression in allotetraploid cotton has been strongly influenced by developmentally regulated, organ-specific silencing, resulting in subfunctionalization of the aggregate ancestral expression profile. this subfunctionalization may occur immediately after polyploidization or may arise over a longer period of evolutionary resolution  <cit> . the net effect is a process that appears to impose a form of selective retention on both homoeologs. thus, expression subfunctionalization leads to prolonged duplicate gene retention, which may in turn enhance the potential for spatial, temporal, or functional divergence of duplicated genes.

here we employ a novel microarray technology, which uses homoeolog specific probe sets, to assess the relative contribution of  <dig>  homoeologous gene pairs to the transcriptome of natural allopolyploid gossypium hirsutum and a synthetic, diploid f <dig> hybrid . we show that the two genomes contribute unequally to the total transcriptome of the allopolyploid. by comparing these entities we demonstrate that, for a substantial fraction of the genome, homoeolog expression biases occur immediately with the onset of genomic merger. in addition, a greater number of homoeolog expression biases appear in allopolyploid cotton that likely were not instigated by genomic merger. these findings indicate that upon allopolyploid formation, homoeolog expression biases happen in two, distinct temporal phases.

RESULTS
assessment of microarray quality
we analyzed the relative a- and d-genome contributions to the transcriptome of a synthetic f <dig> hybrid and ad <dig> allotetraploid cotton. this was done by comparing these mixed transcriptomes with the a <dig> and d <dig> model progenitors as well as with a 1: <dig> mix of a <dig> and d <dig> . in total,  <dig>  homoeolog-specific probe sets  representing  <dig>  unique est contigs  were identified as being reciprocally diagnostic with respect to identifying a- and d-genome specific expression in the f <dig> hybrid and allotetraploid cotton. thus, using conservative measures  ≤  <dig> ), we recovered  <dig>  diagnostic genes, representing  <dig> %  to 4%  of the genic content of the cotton genome. as expected, a principal component analysis on the natural log differences of a- and d-genome expression distinguished among all accessions, placing the ad <dig>  f <dig>  and 1: <dig> mix values intermediate between a <dig> and d <dig> along the first axis . this indicates that the homoeolog-specific probes have performed as designed, and can be expected to yield useful estimates of a- and d-genome contributions to the transcriptome. furthermore, quantitative mass-spectrometry validation of  <dig> homoeologous gene pairs from ad <dig> and  <dig> homoeologous gene pairs from f <dig> indicate that our findings regarding homoeolog-specific expression are reproducible .

detection of genome expression biases in polyploid and f <dig> gossypium
for each gene, a linear model was fit to the three replicate measures of relative a- and d-genome contributions. using fdr corrected p-values  from this model, each gene from the ad <dig> and f <dig> samples was categorized as 'a-biased'  – ln) statistically greater than 1: <dig> mix), 'd-biased'  or 'equivalent' ; see figure 2a. this categorization system is a rudimentary representation of the spectrum of homoeolog expression values, however, all categorizations presented here are based on known reference samples, which mitigates the effects of differential hybridization among homoeolog-specific probe pairs. in addition, this categorization is a statistical description of genome-specific transcript ratios and not a declaration of biological relevance  of biases, which are unknown at present. using this approach, many diagnostic gene pairs  of ad <dig> and  <dig> %  of f1) were inferred to be equivalently expressed in petals. we infer that these gene pairs showed no statistically significant change in homoeologous  contribution to the transcriptome relative to the in vitro mid-parent value. among those genes exhibiting biased expression, there was an approximately  <dig> x and  <dig> x overrepresentation of the d-genome biased genes in petal tissues of ad <dig> and f <dig>  respectively . in addition, we detected  <dig> ad <dig> and  <dig> f <dig> genes that appear to be a-genome silenced and  <dig> ad <dig> and  <dig> f <dig> genes that are d-genome silenced, indicating a significant increase in silencing in the ad <dig> allopolyploid in both the a- and d-genomes. for a limited sampling of genes, expression biases comparable to those above have been demonstrated previously in cotton  <cit> .

comparisons between hybridization  and allopolyploidization 
the comparison between the artificially synthesized f <dig> hybrid and the 1– <dig> my old natural allopolyploid, g. hirsutum , allows us to assess the role genomic merger plays in the allopolyploidization process  <cit> . the inclusion of model a- and d-genome diploid progenitors facilitates inference of ancestral expression states and, hence, the directionality and pace of expression evolution . an additional temporal dimension to the analysis concerns homoeolog-specific expression biases detected in the ad <dig> allopolyploid that were also detected in the f <dig> hybrid . this is demonstrated by both the sizable set of shared genes found within all expression categories  and the positive correlation  between estimates of genomic contribution in the f <dig> hybrid compared with those from the allopolyploid . overall around 24%  of the genes with an a- or d-genome expression bias in the polyploid are also found to be biased in the same direction in the f <dig> hybrid. this indicates that a significant portion of the expression evolution associated with allopolyploidization may have accompanied the initial genomic merger.

an additional directional trend in the data is a tendency for the allopolyploid genes to exhibit more extreme expression biases . both the a- and d-genome biased genes demonstrate a greater number of more extremely biased ad <dig> genes, when compared with the f <dig> , respectively, for shared a- and d-biased sets). in addition, paired t-test for equality between ad <dig> and f <dig> values confirm that the differences in means between ad <dig> and f <dig> are significantly different for d-biased genes , and marginally non-significant for a-biased genes . thus, for genes with immediate expression biases toward one parental gossypium genome, stabilization and evolution of the allopolyploid genome preferentially continues to enhance this initial bias.

discussion
genomic merger and duplicate gene expression evolution
it has long been thought that gene and genome duplication may serve as a key source of evolutionary innovation  <cit> . recently, studies from a diverse array of organisms have demonstrated that gene duplication stimulates a variety of evolutionary outcomes  <cit> . these studies have demonstrated that following duplication, genes may evolve rapidly both at the sequence level and in their expression profile. it is thought that much of this change occurs as a result of the relaxation of purifying selection that occurs following duplication  <cit> . during this period of relaxed selection, duplicate genes either find new roles , partition ancestral roles  or accumulate deleterious mutations and decay as pseudogenes. these processes are thought to occur on an evolutionary timescale measured in thousands to millions of years; for example, it has been estimated that the average half-life of duplicate gene pairs is of the order of  <dig> to  <dig> my for mammals, invertebrates, and plants  <cit> . here we have demonstrated that expression divergence among many genes duplicated by allopolyploidy  is already apparent at the stage of interspecific genomic merger between two genomes . these genes, with conserved homoeologous biases between an ancient allotetraploid and modern f <dig> hybrid, represent the proportion of loci we might expect to have immediately experienced expression alteration at the time of allopolyploid origin  <dig> to  <dig> mya. these data indicate that the critical parameter 'time to subfunctionalization'  <cit> , may actually be zero for a significant fraction of the genome in allopolyploid plants. thus, we conclude that during allopolyploidization, genomic merger per se plays a crucial and persistent role in determining subsequent evolutionary trajectories in homoeolog expression patterns.

in addition to the foregoing set of genes inferred to have experienced instantaneous expression alteration as a consequence of genomic merger, an even larger class of genes did not exhibit shared expression biases in the f <dig> hybrid and ad <dig> allopolyploid. specifically, 76% of the genes that displayed biased expression in ad <dig> were not biased in the intergenomic f <dig>  reciprocally, about 44%  of the genes with biased expression in the f <dig> were not biased in ad <dig>  these differences of expression bias may reflect  additional expression evolution in allopolyploid cotton since the interspecific genomic merger via the mechanisms of neo-, sub-, and non-functionalization  <cit> ,  differences between the parents of the f <dig> hybrid and the actual diploid progenitors of ad <dig> ; that is, the extant diploids are good models but they are not the actual progenitors of allopolyploid gossypium, or  elimination of initial genome specific biases during chromosome doubling or subsequent evolution of the natural ad <dig> allopolyploid.

it has been shown that genes belonging to some functional categories are retained, following duplication, at a higher than expected rate  <cit> . as a corollary, it might be expected that gene function could also affect the likelihood of retention of expression bias. to explore this, we asked if genes from particular gene ontology   <cit>  categories were over- or under-contributing to particular expression bias classes within the f <dig> hybrid and ad <dig> allopolyploid. using the blast2go software  <cit> , only two go categories were found to be significantly over-represented and none were under-represented . both significant go categories were inclusive high-level biological processes ; and coenzyme metabolic process ), and were contained within the equivalently expressed genes from the f <dig> hybrid. we had, however, only limited power  to detect distortions between the observed and expected frequencies of go categories. thus, within our subset of analyzed genes, gene classification does not appear to be a strong predictor of the direction or degree of genome-specific bias, although the strength of this conclusion may be limited by our current sample size.

taken together, these data indicate that a significant proportion  of duplicate gene expression evolution, ascribed to allopolyploid cotton, could have been generated immediately during allopolyploid formation by genetic and epigenetic factors associated with interspecific genomic merger  <cit> . in addition, following allopolyploidy formation, subsequent duplicate gene evolution plays a large role in shaping homoeolog expression patterns. thus, both immediate and long-term evolutionary processes contribute to homoeologous expression patterns. based on this we speculate that expression-induced evolutionary novelty in allopolyploids occurs in two distinct modes: first, an immediate, massive, and saltational disruption of ancestral expression patterns accompanying the polyploidization process; and then a second, more gradual phase of expression evolution mediated by the mechanisms of duplicate gene evolution embodied in the traditional models  <cit>  of the race between duplicate gene preservation and pseudogenization.

'instantaneous subfunctionalization' could enhance duplicate gene retention
the signature of paleopolyploidy  can be found in the genomes of all angiosperms  <cit> . in addition, a high proportion  of paleologs  can be retained for millions of years  <cit> . adams and wendel  <cit>  have shown that a- and d-genome allelic pairs at the adh locus display reciprocal silencing across multiple tissues in two gossypium f <dig> hybrids. thus, upon genomic merger ancestral gene expression domains are immediately partitioned and purifying selection is placed on both duplicate gene pairs, thereby increasing the probabilities of co-retention. to the extent that the results of adams and wendel  <cit>  are mirrored by the present analysis, we have demonstrated that, in petals, around 17%  of the homoeologous gene pairs studied could potentially fit this model, by having been found to be biased immediately in the f <dig> and by having that bias retained throughout allopolyploidy. if we extrapolate this finding to the entire gossypium genome, it would indicate that, following polyploidization, a large number of homoeologs could be retained by 'instantaneous subfunctionalization', occurring solely from the initial effects of genomic merger. furthermore, given that these biases appear to have been maintained for about  <dig> to  <dig> my following polyploidization, this immediate form of expression bias may play an underappreciated role in the retention of duplicate genes following whole genome duplication  <cit> .

tissue-specific expression dominance
an intriguing aspect of the expression bias data is that for both natural ad <dig> allopolyploid and the interspecific f <dig> hybrid, a greater number of genes exhibited a d-genome bias than the reverse . this bias favors the paternal d-genome genome, and stands in contrast to the recently reported a-genome bias described for ovular tissue  <cit> . to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the most extensive example of widespread paternal dominance. when considered in light of the results of yang et al  <cit> , our data suggest that neither gossypium genome is globally dominant with respect to expression, but that instead, each genome may have local dominance in certain tissue types or developmental stages. this finding confirms previous results in gossypium  <cit>  but differs from recent analysis of allotetraploid arabidopsis  <cit> . in the latter study, leaf and flower bud tissues from a synthetic arabidopsis allotetraploid were shown to exhibit dominance favoring only its a. arenosa parent, with genome-wide suppression of the a. thaliana parental contribution. in the tissues that have been studied in gossypium and arabidopsis, it appears that both species demonstrate biased parental contributions to the transcriptome, however, in gossypium these biases can favor either parental genome, whereas in arabidoposis only the a. arenosa parent has demonstrated dominance. these findings reflect the importance and perhaps ad hoc nature of specific genomic combinations and their interactions during allopolyploidization.

among instantaneously subfunctionalized genes, genomic biases tend to become more extreme during subsequent allopolyploid evolution
a notable observation in the present study is that genes showing biased expression patterns, tend to have more extreme biases in the ad <dig> allopolyploid , including a much larger number of silenced genes , when compared with the f <dig> . one possible explanation for enhancement of genome-specific expression in allopolyploid cotton could be that immediately acting epigenetic effects become evolutionarily stabilized, either by natural selection or neutral processes. if this stabilization process is predisposed  toward enhancing the initial expression bias, the result would be evolution toward a more extreme bias. this amplification of expression bias, which to our knowledge has not been described previously, may represent an additional factor underlying the genesis of phenotypic novelty in allopolyploid species.

CONCLUSIONS
these results extend previous findings of homoeolog expression biases in hybrid and allotetraploid cotton  <cit> . by employing microarray technology to analyze a large number of genes, we describe the general phenomenon of genomic expression bias in both a modern synthetic f <dig> hybrid and an ancient allotetraploid. furthermore, for petal tissues, these biases favor the parental d-genome and have become more extreme in the allotetraploid when compared with the f <dig> hybrid. by comparing homoeolog contributions to the transcriptome from the f <dig> hybrid and ad <dig> allotetraploid, it was possible determine the role of genomic merger in producing homoeolog expression biases. given this comparison, we have shown that a significant fraction of the expression biases found in the allotetraploid is likely initiated immediately by genomic merger. a still larger fraction of the expression biases is inferred to have arisen from long-term evolutionary processes, thus implicating two temporally distinct phases of expression evolution following allopolyploidization.
