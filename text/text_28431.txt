BACKGROUND
in nature, trichoderma reesei is as a saprophytic fungus an excellent producer of enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation . in industry, these enzymes are used for a number of applications: xylanases are used for example in food industry as a baking agent and for clarification of juice and wine  <cit>  or in the paper industry for de-inking  <cit> . cellulases from t. reesei are important in textile industry for example for fibre polishing  <cit>  or in the paper industry for recycling processes  <cit> . in the production of ethanol from cellulosic raw material t. reesei enzymes are applied to break down lignocellulose material to release d-glucose. the obtained d-glucose can be used subsequently in the sugar-to-ethanol fermentation . due to the multiple applications of these enzymes many research studies have focused on this organism, its pcwd enzyme expression, and finally, the regulation of the encoding genes. most of these studies were performed in the wild-type strain qm6a  <cit>  or the mutant strain qm <dig>  which was selected for increased cellulase production  <cit> . genome-wide analyses identified  <dig> cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzyme-encoding genes in t. reesei , of which the most prominent cellulases are the cellobiohydrolases cbhi and cbhii   <cit>  and the most studied xylanases are the endo-ß- <dig> -xylanases xyni and xynii   <cit> . the mentioned research efforts led further to the identification of transcription factors involved in the regulation of the expression of genes coding for pcwd enzymes on the transcriptional level. the most important transactivator is the xylanase regulator  <dig> , which is absolutely essential for expression of both, xylanase and cellulase-encoding genes  <cit> . however, it should be noted that only the cellulase expression strictly follows the induction/repression pattern of the xyr <dig> gene  <cit> . the xyr <dig> gene itself is usually expressed at a low level and can be induced by the disaccharide sophorose formed via transglycosylation  <cit> . otherwise, the xylanase expression depends on xyr <dig>  but the transcript levels of these genes do not strictly reflect xyr <dig> transcript levels  <cit> . the most important repressor is the carbon catabolite repressor  <dig>   <cit> , which mediates carbon catabolite repression  in presence of high amounts of easily usable carbon sources, such as d-glucose or d-xylose. cre <dig> exerts its repressing function on both, the genes coding for the pcwd enzymes and the gene coding for their activator, xyr <dig> . the different response of t. reesei’s transcriptome and secretome to cellulose, sophorose, and d-glucose was just recently investigated in a comparative high-throughput genomic and proteomic study  <cit> . while a lot is known about the transcriptional regulation of t. reesei’s pcwd enzyme-encoding genes by regulatory proteins , so far hardly anything was investigated concerning the impact of the chromatin status on their gene expression. only for cre <dig> it was already earlier suggested that it might influence chromatin remodelling  <cit> . more recently, it was reported that it is involved in nucleosome positioning  <cit> , and that a truncated version of cre <dig>  which is present in ccr-released, cellulase hyper-producing strains, supports the opening of chromatin in cre1-target genes  <cit> . however, taking into account that chromatin status generally is believed to be a crucial factor in gene expression, this topic did not receive much attention in t. reesei yet. therefore, in this study, we aimed to learn if the opponent of cre <dig>  the transactivator xyr <dig>  is also involved in chromatin remodelling, and if this happens in a condition -dependent way. we used chromatin accessibility real-time pcr  for determining the chromatin status of the genes encoding the mentioned, four major pcwd enzymes and compared this with their gene expression. the results prompted us to have a more detailed investigation of the cbh <dig> promoter by in vivo footprinting analyses. finally, we used whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing  to identify genes putatively involved in chromatin remodelling that are differentially expressed with regards to the applied condition and/or the absence or presence of xyr <dig> 

RESULTS
decreased cellulase gene expression in the absence of xyr <dig> goes along with denser chromatin
it is well known that xyr <dig> is an essential activator of cellulase gene expression  <cit> . however, so far it has not been investigated if the deletion of xyr <dig> additionally influences the chromatin status in the fungus. in order to study this, the wild-type strain and the xyr <dig> deletion strain were pre-grown and transferred to sophorose , d-glucose  or no carbon source-containing medium  and were incubated for 3 h. by applying chart-pcr analysis we investigated the chromatin packaging of the core promoter region  and one upstream regulatory region  bearing xyr1-binding sites 3-3′;  <cit> ) and/or cre1-binding sites  of the cbh <dig> and cbh <dig> genes each. for overviews on the investigated regions see fig. 1a, b. supplementary, we investigated the transcript levels of these genes by reverse transcription, quantitative pcr  to see if the expression is related to chromatin accessibility. the expression of cbh <dig> and cbh <dig> is repressed on d-glucose in both strains and induced by sophorose in the wild-type strain . the induction is lost in the xyr <dig> deletion strain aside from a small increase in gene expression on sophorose compared to d-glucose. altogether, we observed in both strains a condition-dependent change  of chromatin that went along with a change  in gene expression. however, comparing the strains under the same condition, the chromatin was always more closed in the xyr <dig> deletion strain compared to the wild-type strain  indicating a contribution of xyr <dig> to a general  opening of chromatin in upstream regions of the cellulase-encoding genes.fig.  <dig> overview on the upstream sequence of the investigated genes encoding pcwd enzymes. the regions investigated by chart-pcr are indicated by black bars. the core promoter region covering the tata-box  and an urr of the cbh <dig> , cbh <dig> , xyn <dig> , and xyn <dig>  genes each are depicted. dna-binding sites of xyr <dig> and cre <dig> are indicated by orange and purple triangles, respectively. the orientation of the triangle represents the orientation of the binding motif. the scale at the top indicates distance from atg in bp

xylanase gene repression in the absence of xyr <dig> is not strictly related to chromatin compaction
in an analogous analysis we investigated the chromatin status of the core promoter and an urr of the xyn <dig> and xyn <dig> genes each and compared this to the expression of the respective genes. for overviews on the regions investigated by chart-pcr see fig. 1c, d. in the wild-type strain the repression on d-glucose, the basal expression on d-xylose, and the induction on sophorose coincided with the increasing opening of chromatin . otherwise, in the xyr <dig> deletion strain the gene expression was at a similar low level  independent from the tested condition, while the chromatin packaging differed between the conditions. interestingly, the chromatin accessibility on sophorose was even similar between the Δxyr1-strain and the wild-type strain  but the sophorose-mediated induction was completely lost in the Δxyr1-strain . summarizing, we detected - similar to the case of the cellulase-encoding genes - an induction-specific opening of chromatin together with increasing gene expression in the wild-type strain. however, different from the cellulases, xylanase expression was repressed in the Δxyr1-strain although the chromatin status differed condition-dependently.fig.  <dig> transcript and chart analysis of xylanase-encoding genes in the presence or absence of xyr <dig>  the t. reesei wild-type strain  and the Δxyr1-strain  were pre-grown on glycerol and thereafter incubated on d-glucose , d-xylose  or sophorose  for 3 h. the core promoter region  and an urr  of xyn <dig>  and xyn <dig>  genes were investigated. the gene expression analysis was performed by cdna synthesis followed by qpcr, and transcript levels are depicted on the x-axis. chart-pcr was performed by dnasei digestion followed by qpcr, and cais are depicted on the y-axis. in both cases sar <dig> and act genes were used for data normalization and the wild-type strain incubated without carbon source for 3 h was the reference condition. the dashed line indicates transcript level of the reference condition, i.e. levels above are considered induced and levels below are considered repressed. all values are means from measurements in triplicates and three biological experiments . the error bars indicate standard deviations. diagrams are identically scaled



contribution of xyr <dig> to chromatin opening
to understand in detail the contribution of xyr <dig> to changes in chromatin packing, the relation to induction of gene expression, and its putative impact on transcription initiation, we used chart analysis again. we compared samples from the t. reesei wild-type and the xyr <dig> deletion strain exposed to sophorose  and to non carbon source . in the wild-type strain chromatin opens specifically on sophorose in case of all tested genes, namely xyn <dig>  xyn <dig>  cbh <dig>  and cbh <dig> . this is lost for all genes in the Δxyr1-strain . however, the induction specific opening of chromatin is more pronounced in case of the cellulase-encoding genes. altogether, the comparison of the chromatin accessibility under induced and non-induced conditions in the wild-type and the ∆xyr1-strain even suggested that the open status is a consequence of induction. xyr <dig> is required for the chromatin loosening, but this action is not essential for the initiation of transcription because transcripts can also be detected at low levels in a xyr <dig> deletion strain .fig.  <dig> chart analysis of cellulase- and xylanase-encoding genes in presence and. the t. reesei wild-type strain  and the Δxyr1-strain  were pregrown on glycerol and thereafter incubated without carbon source  or in presence of  <dig>  mm sophorose  for 3 h. the core promoter regions of cbh <dig>  cbh <dig>  xyn <dig>  and xyn <dig> genes were investigated. chart-pcr was performed by dnasei digestion followed by qpcr using sar <dig> and act genes were for data normalization. chromatin accession indices  are depicted on the y-axis. all values are means from measurements in triplicate and three biological experiments . the error bars depict the standard deviation and different letters denote statistical difference among compared data employing t-test 



the absence of xyr <dig> changes dna accessibility in the cbh <dig> promoter
since we observed a pronounced induction-specific opening of chromatin that went along with increase of gene expression in presence of xyr <dig> and a closing of chromatin together with gene repression in the absence of xyr <dig> in the case of the cellulase-encoding genes, we aimed to have a more detailed investigation on the dna accessibility of the promoter. therefore, we performed in vivo footprinting analyses of the cbh <dig> promoter. two urrs bearing xyr1-binding sites and/or cre1-binding sites and the core promoter bearing xyr1-binding sites close to the tata-box were investigated . the wild-type strain and the Δxyr1-strain were pre-grown on glycerol and then incubated on d-glucose or sophorose for 3 h followed by dimethyl sulphate -induced in vivo methylation. from fig. 5b–d the footprinting pattern of the xyr <dig> deletion strain compared to the wild-type strain for the three investigated regions can be inferred. the first investigated urr bears next to a single cre1-site and a single xyr1-site, also two xyr1-sites arranged as inverted repeat with a spacing of 11 bp, which was reported to be the functional binding motif in vivo  <cit> . under both, repressing and inducing conditions we could detect strong differences in the footprinting pattern of the two strains . in particular on sophorose, we observed an increased hypersensitivity towards dna methylation on the xyr1-sites in the Δxyr1-strain compared to the wild-type strain, whereas the cre1-site was stronger protected . the second investigated urr bears a functional cre <dig> double site  <cit> . here, we detected strong hypermethylation signals in the Δxyr1-strain compared to the wild-type strain on d-glucose, but none on sophorose . the third investigated urr bears three xyr1-binding sites arranged in tandem. in this case, we detected just a few differences between the two strains, however, most of them on or close to the xyr1-sites .fig.  <dig>

identification of differentially expressed genes potentially involved in chromatin remodelling
to learn more about the mechanisms responsible for the chromatin remodelling in context to both, the applied condition and the presence or absence of xyr <dig>  we used wtss. therefore, a xyr <dig> deletion strain and its parental strain qm <dig> were again exposed to repressing conditions  and inducing conditions . please note that the full data set can be obtained from geo database . based on the results obtained by the wtss, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of  <dig> candidate genes involved in chromatin structure and dynamics according to the eukaryotic orthologous groups  in the t. reesei genome database . an overview on these  <dig> genes is provided here. for the differential expression analysis, a two-fold change cut-off, i.e. log <dig> fold change ≥  <dig> or ≤ − <dig> and an adjusted p-value ≤  <dig> , was used as threshold. concerning the first part of our question, i.e. the observed differences in chromatin status dependent on the applied condition, we identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed on sophorose as compared to d-glucose in the wild-type strain . concerning, the second part of our question, i.e. the influence of xyr <dig> on the expression profiles of these genes we examined which ones were differentially expressed in Δxyr1-strain compared to the wild-type strain under sophorose induction. out of the  <dig> genes responding to the applied condition, two genes are additionally differentially expressed in the Δxyr1-strain . notably, the gene with transcript id  <dig>  encoding a putative heterochromatin-associated protein, was down-regulated on sophorose compared to d-glucose and up-regulated in the absence of xyr <dig> table  <dig> differentially expressed genes that are potentially involved in chromatin remodelling

discussion
the aim of this study was to learn more about the contribution of the chromatin compaction to the regulation of gene expression of pcwd enzymes in t. reesei. altogether, we found for all investigated genes that their induced expression is accompanied by an opening of chromatin and that xyr <dig> is required for the open chromatin status.

however, we observed differences between cellulase- and xylanase-encoding genes concerning the involvement of xyr <dig> in chromatin remodelling: the chromatin of the upstream regions of the cellulase-encoding genes was more compact under all tested conditions when xyr <dig> was missing. this finding is supported by the in vivo footprinting results of the cbh <dig> urr, which revealed an increased sensitivity towards methylation on the xyr1-binding sites in the absence of xyr <dig>  in particular on sophorose . on the other hand, the accessibility of the functional cre1-sites was changed only on d-glucose. they were found to be stronger methylated in the xyr <dig> deletion strain than in the parent strain . we assume that hypersensitivity to dna methylation can be caused by both, non-occupancy leading to better access for the methylation agent, but also by dna occupancy and a following increased disposition to be methylated. considering this, we would suggest that on d-glucose repression the cre <dig> dna-binding affinity to the cbh <dig> promoter is higher in the absence of xyr <dig>  this could explain the less accessible chromatin in the ∆xyr1-strain on d-glucose . in summary, the presence of xyr <dig> supported chromatin opening under all investigated conditions in the case of the cellulase-encoding genes. perhaps this finding is one explanation for the previously reported, condition-dependent transcript level pattern of the cbh <dig> and cbh <dig> genes that exactly follow the one of the xyr <dig> gene  <cit> . for example, if under non-inducing conditions less xyr <dig> is present, the positive influence of xyr <dig> on chromatin opening might be reduced and this would cause a decrease in cellulase-encoding gene expression. however, the earlier observation that transcript levels of cbh <dig> and cbh <dig> correlate with those of xyr <dig>  <cit> , and the result from this study indicating the involvement of xyr <dig> in chromatin opening suggest a regulation of the cellulase-encoding genes being dominated by xyr <dig> 

it is currently thought that transcription factors must induce the reorganization of the local chromatin . one proposed mechanism is the recruitment of nucleosome remodelers by the initiating factor leading to local chromatin conformations  <cit> . our current model on the function of the xyr <dig> is the following: as shown in previous studies xyr <dig> transcription is induced on sophorose  <cit> . this allows the assumption that under this condition xyr1-sites are occupied, which is supported by in vivo footprinting results obtained during this study. we would suggest that xyr <dig> recruits chromatin remodelers leading to the observed, more open chromatin status. this provides easier access for the transcription machinery leading to increased induction of the target gene  under this condition.

in the case of the xylanase-encoding genes we also detected a condition-dependent induction of gene expression, which was accompanied by chromatin opening in the wild-type strain. however, the involvement of xyr <dig> is different in this case as compared to the cellulase-encoding genes. in the absence of xyr <dig> gene expression decreased under all conditions, but the chromatin in the upstream regions of the xylanase-encoding genes did not always became more compact. for example, in the case of xyn <dig>  the urr had a similar chromatin accessibility under non-repressing conditions  in the Δxyr1-strain as in the wild-type strain but the gene expression was strongly repressed in the absence of xyr <dig>  the fact that gene expression can be repressed simultaneously with enhanced chromatin accessibility might be explained by a generally better access for all kinds of regulatory proteins including repressor proteins. another possible explanation would be that the absence of xyr <dig> simply overrules the level of regulation by chromatin opening. anyway, during this study it became obvious that the activating function of xyr <dig> on xylanase-encoding gene expression is not mainly exerted on the chromatin level. there are earlier reports on generally different, condition-dependent transcript level patterns of the xyn <dig> and xyn <dig> genes as compared to the xyr <dig> gene  <cit> . one example is the low basal xyn <dig> gene expression on d-glucose  that is not detectable for the xyr <dig> gene  <cit> . all these findings together strongly indicate that additional regulatory factors  and mechanisms, which are responsible for chromatin opening under inducing conditions, need to be involved.

a whole transcriptome analysis was used to identify genes classified as chromatin remodelers in t. reesei, which are differentially expressed dependent on the applied condition . notably,  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in the wild-type strain , whereas only ten genes responded in a condition-dependent manner in the Δxyr1-strain . this again supports the assumption that xyr <dig> is generally involved in chromatin remodelling mechanisms. the identification of two putative chromatin remodelers, which are under the control of xyr <dig> , point to an indirect role of xyr <dig> in chromatin remodelling. moreover, it can be speculated that xyr <dig> additionally recruits chromatin-remodelling proteins in a differential manner towards the promoters of the cellulase- and xylanase-encoding genes. this would be a further explanation for the observed differences concerning the influence of xyr <dig> on their chromatin status. however, at this stage it remains to be investigated if the open chromatin is indeed the result of chromatin remodelling  or if the loss of the identified putative chromatin remodelers overrules the action of xyr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
investigations on the level of chromatin packaging revealed that the transcription factor xyr <dig> does exert its activating function—in addition to other possible mechanisms - by an induction-specific opening of chromatin. the impact of xyr <dig> in chromatin opening was more pronounced in the case of cellulase-encoding genes than in the case of the xylanase-encoding genes. the application of wtss identified one chromatin remodeler that is down-regulated under inducing conditions and up-regulated if xyr <dig> is missing. according to the results of the present study, this is a target in engineering strains with enhanced cellulase expression.
