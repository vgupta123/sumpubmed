BACKGROUND
the use of mrna to encode a protein as a vehicle in gene therapy was extensively used in cancer research  <cit> . this method relies on the in vitro transfection of mrna into autologous dendritic cells  that are re-administered to the patient. it has shown good efficiency in terms of induction of t-cell responses in cancer patients, but presented several drawbacks including cost, limited number of cells/vaccine doses, and the intrinsic phenotypic variability of the in vitro generated dcs. moreover, the ideal maturation state and delivery modalities of transfected dcs are still matter of debate. as an alternative, mrna could be used in naked form. direct injection of mrna coding for immune dominants antigens could lead a strong immune response against the encoded antigen, as demonstrated in cancer models  <cit> . recently, weid  <cit>  concluded the second phase 1/ <dig> vaccination trial in metastatic melanoma patients. using mrna from six different immune dominant antigens from melanoma he showed that after vaccination patients developed important cd4+ immune response. one important feature of naked mrna is the ability of fast activation of the innate immune system by pathways such as toll like receptors   <cit> , rig  <dig> and mda <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the action of the translated protein encoded by the naked mrna can also take part in the induction of specific immune response.

tuberculosis  causes more than  <dig> million deaths per year all over the word  <cit> . currently the only available tuberculosis vaccine is mycobacterium bovis bacillus calmette-guerìn , but its effectiveness varies, particularly against the adult pulmonary form of the disease  <cit> . the increasing incidence of aids, long chemical treatments and the emergence of multidrug resistant strains are compelling evidences for the urgency of new therapeutic strategies against tb  <cit> . since its first description in march,  <dig>  <cit> , resistance has become the most alarming issue in international tuberculosis control and might be responsible for compromising the progress observed in many countries over the last decade  <cit> .

many studies of subunit vaccines have been undertaken by using different antigens, such as ag <dig> complex  <cit> ,  <dig> kda protein  <cit> ,  <dig> kda protein  <cit> , rd <dig> region  <cit>  and ag85b-esat- <dig> complex  <cit> . it has been reported that  <dig> kda heat shock protein  is one of the major immune reactive proteins during the mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection. additionally, the immunity induced by dna vaccines encoding m. leprae hsp <dig>  can reduce the bacterial loads in spleen and lung of the infected mice after intramuscular injection  <cit> . the immunity induced by hsp <dig> reflects mainly in the production of th <dig> cytokines mostly ifn-gamma  <cit> . moreover, it was well demonstrated that dna vaccines encoding mtb hsp <dig>  initially designed to prevent infection, also had a pronounced therapeutic effect, which could eliminate the bacteria in tb mice after antibacterial chemotherapy  <cit> . the antigens cited above have already been tested using plasmid dna constructs. once plasmid dna is the major contributor in the tb vaccine list, some issues concerning security, like the possibility of dna integration and autoimmunity, cannot be assured  <cit> . in this way, the development of a new strategy based on messenger rna  can be an attractive approach. we show here that one intranasal dose of  <dig> μg of mrna coding for hsp <dig> protein from m. leprae leads to an immune response that protects mice against m. tuberculosis infection.

RESULTS
expression profile of mrna-hsp <dig> produced in vitro
the first step in the protocol of the mrna vaccine was to evaluate if the mrna production had been successful. as shown in figure  <dig>  the purified mrna-hsp <dig> and ef-1α mrna showed a fragment of  <dig> -bp  and  <dig> -bp , respectively, which matched the expected length. when the mrna-hsp <dig> and the control mrna were treated with rnase a, no fragment was observed , confirming the homogeneity of the mrna preparation. in order to verify the presence of possible sites that could inhibit the translation of mrna-hsp <dig>  we also determined the rna-hsp <dig> predicted structure using mfold web based software <cit>  . these analyses showed that mrna-hsp <dig> did not have significant loops or arms that could interrupt the translation process.

to determine if mrna-hsp <dig> could be translated in mammalian cells, we first detected mrna and protein in mrna-hsp65-transfected hek293t cells. the figure  <dig> rt-pcr and  <dig> western-blot confirms the mrna stability and the hsp <dig> protein expression in hek293t cells at various time points after the mrna uptake by these cells. after  <dig> minutes,  <dig> and  <dig> hours of the incubation we detected mrna-hsp <dig> by rt-pcr . presumably mrna was consumed or degraded by the cell metabolism after  <dig> hours from the inoculation of the mrna, as observed by the lack of intensity of gel fragment. the protein expression was observed after  <dig> minutes of inoculation with mrna-hsp <dig> and persisted until  <dig> hours later . these results confirmed that mrna-hsp <dig> is stable inside mammalian cells and could be translated in hsp <dig> protein.

lung antigen presenting cells  can uptake mrna-hsp <dig> in vivo after intranasal immunization
once mrna was captured and translated in vitro, we evaluated if mrna-hsp <dig> could be uptaken by mammalian cells in vivo. to test this hypothesis, mice were intranasally immunized with tagged mrna-hsp <dig>  after different time points lung cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. from  <dig> minutes until  <dig> hours post-immunization we observed that dendritic cells were the majority of cells that had uptaken the mrna-hsp <dig> when compared with macrophages and b cells. four hours after the immunization around 25% of dendritic cells were positive for the tagged mrna . besides the uptake by classical apcs we do not detected non apcs cells marked for tagged mrna-hsp <dig> . taken together these data confirmed that intranasal route could be used for mrna vaccine strategy, since these molecules were able to reach lung apcs.

vaccination with mrna-hsp <dig> induces protection against tuberculosis
in order to verify if mrna-hsp <dig> vaccination strategy works in vivo, we tested this strategy in tuberculosis experimental model. thus, we challenged mice by intranasal route with virulent m. tuberculosis h37rv  <dig> days after immunization with the  <dig> or  <dig> μg of mrna-hsp <dig> or control ef-1α mrna or bcg. four weeks after the challenge with m. tuberculosis, bacterial loads in the lungs were quantified by cfu protocol. only mice that were immunized with  <dig> μg of mrna-hsp <dig>  showed a significant decrease of bacterial count when compared with the mrna control or the rl control group  . the bcg group was used as a positive protection control. histological lung sections from infected mice were analyzed to determine the development and the presence of the inflammatory infiltrates. as shown in figure  <dig>  mice treated with  <dig> μg mrna-hsp <dig> vaccine  or bcg  showed almost intact alveolar tissue. on the other hand, there was considerable infiltration of mononuclear cells and extensive parenchyma destruction evidenced by large and poorly demarcated granuloma in the lungs from the control mice immunized only with  <dig> or  <dig> μg of ef-1α mrna .

immunization with mrna-hsp <dig> induces production of il- <dig> and tnf-alpha cytokines
cytokines play an important role in the immune response to m. tuberculosis, since it was demonstrate that vaccination with mrna-hsp <dig> induces protection against tuberculosis we explore if the immunization with mrna-hsp <dig> generated specific th <dig> cytokine production. we observed that immunization with  <dig> μg of naked mrna-hsp <dig> induced a specific and significant increase of ifn-gamma  and tnf-alpha  compared to rl control group. concanavalin a  stimulation was used as control. cytokine production obtained with cona was shown in additional file  <dig> 

mrna-hsp <dig> stimulation lead no production via toll like receptor 7
once it was shown that mrna-hsp <dig> could induce protection against m. tuberculosis challenged in vivo, we explored if this effect could be started by tlr <dig> activation. thus, hek293t cells were transfected with tlr  <dig> and exposed to mrna-hsp <dig> in vitro. measuring no release from these cells, we showed that mrna-hsp <dig> stimulates the production of this molecule significantly via tlr  <dig> receptor .

discussion
we showed here that one dose of  <dig> μg of naked mrna encoding m. leprae hsp <dig> was enough to protect mice against m. tuberculosis infection. we also showed that this naked mrna stimulated th1specific cytokine production and was efficiently captured by different lung apcs after intranasal immunization, mainly by dendritic cells and. moreover we detected activation of tlr <dig> pathway via mrna-hsp <dig> 

the use of naked mrna as a vehicle for gene therapy has increasing in the last few years. the majority of the studies used mrna transfected in dendritic cells and were focused on the stimulation of cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocyte response, as well as on the induction of cd4+ t helper cell response, in order to obtain optimal and sustained immune responses capable of eliminating tumor cells  <cit> . although the use of naked mrna was more restricted to cancer research until now, in this report we showed that it is possible to use naked mrna intranasally against a pulmonary disease. this mrna can pass through all nasal and tracheal barriers and reach the lungs, where they can be captured by different apcs. in our approach we used an mrna from m. leprae hsp <dig>  which has already been extensively evaluated as an experimental tuberculosis vaccine, an mrna capable of being translated into transfected mammalian cells. in hek 293t cells transfected with mrna-hsp <dig> the protein expression was observed since the early  <dig> hours of the delivery of the mrna, until  <dig> hours after transfection. these results showed that any possible differences in protein expression of prokaryotic system like codon bias  <cit>  did not suppress the expression of m. leprae protein in mammalian system. also, mrna-hsp <dig> was stable and ready for expression in mammalian system, suggesting that the formulated vaccine mrna can be kept inside hek 293t cells until its translation. besides, we used bioinformatics tools to show that produced mrna-hsp <dig> had a minimum structure that would not interfere in the translation process, since this parameter is very important to initiate the protein production  <cit> . we also confirmed that once the mrna was inside the cell, the translation process could be done, with the production of hsp <dig>  <dig> minutes after the transfection process . this result could explain the functionality of the vaccination, once we observed protein production and protection against m. tuberculosis infection in mice. in addition, the induction of specific immune response against the mrna encoding antigen, can also be useful in gene therapy because this kind of mrna have some structural characteristics that confer the ability to activate apcs  <cit> .

after the translation process, the produced protein can enter in the class i pathway of immunologic presentation process for activation of cd8+ t cells or participate of cross-priming process for cd4+ t cells  <cit> . the mrna performs this activation process and in the maximum of  <dig>   <dig> hours disappears of the system. this interesting characteristic differs from other gene therapy vehicles such as plasmid dna vaccines that can be rescued in the in vivo system after  <dig> months of immunization  <cit> . in addition to mrna stability, we showed the uptake of this mrna by lung apcs, mainly dendritic cells, after the intranasal immunization, suggesting that transfected dendritic cells may induce a protective immune response. the activation state of these cells was critical in the tuberculosis infection since macrophages and dendritic cells can stop the infection in the early stages, if stimulated. moreover after the immunization this apcs can stimulate specific t cells, creating memory t cells  <cit> .

the cfu counting and histopathology analysis showed that  <dig> μg of mrna-hsp <dig> given by the intranasal route can reduce the bacterial load and inflammation in mice lungs. when we compared the cfu results from mice immunized with the control mrna containing the mrna-hsp <dig> group it is possible to reaffirm that hsp <dig> is a vaccine antigen, since the control mrna group neither decreased the bacterial load nor improved the lung inflammation as compared with rl group. we speculated that only innate cellular activation provided by the control mrna was not able to protect mice against tuberculosis.

the protection that we obtained in our experiments was very motivating since we used only one dose of  <dig> μg of mrna-hsp <dig> by the intranasal route, contrasting the use of three doses of  <dig> μg plasmid dna by intramuscular route in the original research  <cit>  passing by prime-boost  <cit>  and recently with entrapment of plasmid dna in cationic vesicles reduce to an single dose of  <dig> ug of plasmid by the intranasal route  <cit> . besides, we used a needle free immunization, intranasal, which has a great advantage in the development of a tb vaccine since the nasal associated lymphoid tissue participate in the initiation and modulation of immune response against pulmonary infections  <cit> .

moreover we showed that immunization with mrna-hsp <dig> could induce specifically production of th <dig> cytokines ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha. ifn-gamma are essential for the development of protective immunity against tb  <cit>  and is probably the most important factor that activates macrophages antimycobacterial action, at least in tb response  <cit> . the importance of tnf-alpha in tb improved since the discovery of reactivation of dormant tb in patients using tnf-neutralizing drugs  <cit> . from these studies the role of tnf in the formation of granuloma was demonstrated  <cit> . tnf-alpha blockage impair the antimicrobial activity of memory cd8+ t cells by reducing the production of perforin and granulysin the major components of cd8+ t antimicrobial response to intracellular pathogens  <cit> . thus the mrna approach could induces a th <dig> pattern like dna vaccines.

furthermore the presence of important cytokines after mrna-hsp <dig> immunization, driven by the expression of hsp <dig> protein, we asked if this mrna molecule could induce intracellular activation via toll like receptor  <dig>  through in vitro experiments we showed that mrna-hsp <dig> binds tlr <dig> leading the production of no, an antimicrobrial molecule that is induced by tlr  <cit> . the activation via tlr <dig> culminates in nf-kb expression leading production of inflammatory cytokines. this process could occur simultaneously with the hsp <dig> protein production, which may be considered a potent co-stimulatory event that enhances the immune activation of hsp <dig> protein.

in the last two decades, tuberculosis incidence changed from a disease exclusive of poor countries into a worldwide illness. this change becomes visible with the presence of multi-resistance and extreme resistant strains of m. tuberculosis all over the word  <cit> . thus, the search for a new vaccine against tb became a very important issue. but until now the only available vaccine is bcg that has been extensively used, but is not always effective. our group has worked on the development of a tuberculosis vaccine using different approaches that could deliver a well know and effective antigen to the immune system  <cit> .

thus, the use of mrna as a vaccine or in treatments seems to be highly effective. this promising mrna immunization was approved to the first human treatment trial protocol, in which intradermal injections of cv <dig> stable mrna was used against metastatic prostate cancer as well as another strategy using mrna from tumor as an immune activator  <cit> . pascolo and others showed the feasibility and safety of this protocol in humans  <cit> . these two examples demonstrate that the use of mrna in gene therapy seems to be one of the easiest, most versatile and theoretically safest technologies in this field. our results open a perspective to use of this strategy in other infectious disease models with a cost effective when compared with other systems.

CONCLUSIONS
the mrna based vaccination protocol described here, showed that one immunization with of  <dig> μg of hsp <dig> mrna administered by the intranasal route could lead suppression of experimental tuberculosis in mice. since our approach use low dose of a non toxical molecule, delivered by a needle free immunization and is able to establish protection against tuberculosis, it opens a new perspective in gene therapy and can be used in other diseases since is safety, fast and easy to made.
