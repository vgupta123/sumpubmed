BACKGROUND
the plant kingdom is usually associated with autotrophy as most plants produce their own nutrients via photosynthesis. plant parasitism presents a divergence from this generalization as parasitic plants derive all or part of their nutrients and water from their host plants. about  <dig>  parasitic plant species are widely distributed among various taxa and over diverse environments, ranging from arctic to tropical climates. some of the best known parasitic plants include the christmas ornament mistletoe, the world largest blooming flower rafflesia, the fragant oil producing sandalwood, and the debilitating agricultural weeds dodder, witchweed  and broomrape . although diverse in morphology, reproductive aspects, and life habitats, all parasitic plants share a specialized organ - the haustorium - which they evolved to assure a successful life cycle 
 <cit> –
 <cit> . parasitic plants develop haustoria either near their root tips or along their stems in response to selective chemical factors released by their hosts 
 <cit> . the haustorium initiates via localized cell expansion and division that is coupled with haustorial hair growth in many species. following attachment and penetration of the host’s roots or stems, the haustorium establishes a vascular continuity between the parasite and its host through which water and nutrients are channeled to the parasite to benefit its own growth and development. by so doing, parasitic plants disturb many developmental and physiological aspects of host plants 
 <cit> . consequently, parasitic plants have a tremendous impact on community ecology among plants, animals, microbes, and even the surrounding physical environment 
 <cit> . therefore, studies on parasitic plants encompass a range of interests, including anatomy and development, cellular physiology, gene regulation, population genetics, phylogeny, ecology and evolution. here, we focus on a variety of aspects of host perception and recognition by parasitic plants.

the perception and recognition by parasitic plants of haustorium inducing factors  released by host plants is best documented in root parasites of the orobanchaceae family . the first three hifs identified, xenognosin  a, xenognosin b, and  <dig> -dimethoxybenzoquinone , are phenolic compounds 
 <cit> –
 <cit> . additionally, various quinone and flavonoid hifs were subsequently identified and characterized 
 <cit> . further studies on hif biogenesis, activity, and recognition in the two root hemiparasites striga spp. and triphysaria spp. have shed light onto the chemical signaling by dmbq, which is involved in the first steps of the haustorium developmental pathway 
 <cit> –
 <cit> . the genus striga contains prolific weeds causing substantial damage to cereal crops mostly in africa 
 <cit> , whereas triphysaria is a wild native genus in the grassland communities of northern american coastlands 
 <cit> . the current model for haustorium initiation proposes that certain unidentified peroxidases or laccases released by parasitic roots catalyze the production of dmbq at the host contact site, which diffuses towards the parasitic plant 
 <cit> . next, a quinone oxidoreductase from the parasite converts dmbq from its inactive form into the transiently active single-electron free radical form with the suitable redox potential for haustorium induction. this process is hypothesized to be the first step of the haustorium organogenesis pathway 
 <cit> .

to date, only two parasitic plant genes involved in haustorium development have been identified, tvqr <dig> and tvpirin, both from the root parasite triphysaria versicolor  
 <cit> . the tvpirin protein is a general transcription co-factor that up-regulates several dmbq-responsive and –non-responsive genes 
 <cit> . tvqr <dig> encodes the aforementioned quinone oxidoreductase, which catalyses the reduction of quinones 
 <cit> . in comparison to the hif dmbq, this enzyme displays even higher catalytic activities for three other non-hif quinones, one of which is juglone 
 <cit> . consistent with its biochemical role, tvqr <dig> gene expression is rapidly up-regulated in t. versicolor root tips exposed to either maize or arabidopsis root exudates containing active hifs, dmbq or the non-hif juglone 
 <cit> . by contrast, up-regulation of tvpirin in root tips only occurs in response to dmbq and arabidopsis root exudates 
 <cit> .

most identified hifs are quinones like dmbq, which are known to be abundant in plant exudates and have also been associated with allelopathic effects  and defense against pathogens 
 <cit> . at concentrations below 10-4 m, quinone hifs induce haustorium development in parasitic plants 
 <cit> . however, at concentrations between10-4 m and 10-3 m, they impart the negative effects of oxidative stress to parasitic plants that result in root necrosis and a reduction in the frequency of haustorium formation 
 <cit> . further underscoring this quinone toxicity is the enrichment of transcripts involved in oxidative stress and detoxification pathways in t. versicolor root tips following exposure to dmbq or host root exudates 
 <cit> . like dmbq, juglone is a well-known allelopathic compound present copiously in root exudates of the black walnut tree 
 <cit> , but unlike dmbq, juglone lacks the haustorium-inducing capability 
 <cit> . the fact that juglone is a better substrate for tvqr <dig> than dmbq 
 <cit>  correlates with the faster and stronger up-regulation of tvqr <dig> expression in t. versicolor root tips upon juglone exposure 
 <cit> . the only non-quinone hif known to date is the flavonoid peonidin 
 <cit> . peonidin belongs to the anthocyanin class of compounds present in red colored flowers and fruits that act as potent antioxidants by scavenging free radicals, and play various roles in plant development and stress protection 
 <cit> –
 <cit> . although peonidin is a hif as potent as dmbq for t. versicolor <cit> , its role in the regulation of tvqr <dig> and tvpirin gene expression during haustorium development has not yet been investigated. furthermore, the availability of peonidin, a non-toxic hif, dmbq, a toxic hif, and juglone, a toxic non-hif, offers the opportunity to utilize these three chemicals to de-couple the two seemingly intertwined pathways triggered by the quinone hifs - namely the oxidative stress response and haustorium organogenesis.

to understand how tvpirin and tvqr <dig> contribute to the perception of various phytochemicals present in the rhizosphere and, thus, to the initiation of haustorium development, it is essential to survey their patterns of polymorphism in natural populations of t. versicolor. since so far only a single allele of each of these two genes has been reported 
 <cit> –
 <cit> , we examined the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism of tvqr <dig> and tvpirin by using 20 t. versicolor individual plants from natural populations of the northern californian grasslands. we found strikingly higher allelic diversity in tvqr <dig> compared to tvpirin, with the highest non-synonymous substitution rate in the catalytic domain of the tvqr <dig> protein. in addition, we provide evidence that tvpirin encodes a protein shorter than the one previously reported 
 <cit> , and show that tvqr <dig> and tvpirin are differentially regulated by hifs and non-hif. our results suggest that tvqr <dig>  unlike tvpirin, has maintained a high level of nucleotide diversity, which might reflect its important role in the perception of various phytochemicals from host plants.

RESULTS
tvqr <dig> and tvpirin are differentially regulated by haustorium inducers and non-inducers
to compare the regulation of tvqr <dig> and tvpirin, we selected two hifs and a non-hif displaying overlapping and differential biological properties on parasitic plants: dmbq with the dual role of an oxidative stress agent and haustorium inducer, peonidin as a non-toxic hif, and juglone as a non-hif quinone and strong oxidative stress agent. in t. versicolor in vitro haustoria formation assays, both dmbq and juglone reduced haustorium formation frequency and caused root necrosis at concentrations of ≥ 50 μm , in agreement with previous observations 
 <cit> . although either 10 μm dmbq or 30 μm juglone alone did not result in root necrosis or a reduced frequency of haustorium formation, the combination of both treatments did , further substantiating quinone toxicity to the parasite. on the other hand, peonidin had no toxic effects on t. versicolor, even at 1 mm concentration . using northern blot hybridizations, we examined the spatial and temporal pattern of transcript levels of tvqr <dig> and tvpirin in response to dmbq, peonidin, and juglone in three areas of t. versicolor seedlings - root tips, the remainder of the roots, and shoots - at  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 hours  after treatment. tvqr <dig> was more strongly up-regulated by the non-hif juglone than by the hif dmbq , corroborating its higher substrate affinity for juglone 
 <cit> . on the other hand, tvpirin was similarly up-regulated by both the hifs dmbq and peonidin, but not by the non-hif juglone . these up-regulation patterns were observed only in roots but not in shoots , consistent with a role for tvqr <dig> and tvpirin in haustorium development only in the root. we further confirmed the differential expression of tvqr <dig> and tvpirin in response to these hifs and non-hifs in t. versicolor root tips at 2–3 h post-treatment by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  . our results suggest that tvqr <dig> is associated with both the oxidative stress response and haustorium initiation, while tvpirin appears to be mainly involved in haustorium development. determining whether tvpirin is exclusively regulated by hifs and only involved in haustorium initiation would require the analysis of additional non-toxic hifs, which so far have not been identified.

haustorium formation and root necrosis were scored on t. versicolor seedlings  24 hours after treatment.

tvpirin encodes a  <dig> amino acid long protein
the tvpirin gene was initially identified as an incomplete est  from a suppressive subtractive hybridization  library enriched for t. versicolor root tip transcripts that are up-regulated by dmbq 
 <cit> . to determine the sequence of the full length tvpirin transcript, we performed 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cdna ends  reactions and rt-pcr with primers complementary to both ends of the race clones using a pooled rna population isolated from t. versicolor root tips with haustoria induced by 20 μm dmbq. alignment of the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> independently recovered 5′ race, 3′ race, and full-length cdna clones, respectively, revealed a tvpirin open reading frame  encoding a  <dig> amino acid  long protein with a 5′ untranslated region  of 64– <dig> base pairs  . however, the previously published tvpirin cdna sequence  has a coding capacity for a  <dig> aa long protein 
 <cit> . this cdna sequence was created by contig assemblies following  <dig> and illumina sequencing of the t. versicolor transcriptome 
 <cit> . in comparison to the sequence of the tvpirin full length cdna reported here , that of the trvebc2_ <dig> clone contains an additional 80 bp in the 5′utr and an extra 100 bp in the 3′utr . the extended 5′utr in clone trvebc2_ <dig> contains an atg codon that was assigned as the translation start codon and explains the longer coding sequence of the previously published tvpirin orf . in order to resolve these discrepancies regarding the tvpirin transcript 5′utr and orf, we performed in silico experiments and quantitative transcriptional assays.

first, blast-searches for the presence of other tvpirin contig assemblies from the t. versicolor transcriptome  uncovered seven clones with homology to the tvpirin cdna clone trvebc2_ <dig> . two of these clones  had the same orientation as the tvpirin cdna and lacked the extended 5′utr. the remaining  <dig> clones had the reverse orientation and 5′ utrs of variable lengths. one of these clones  had the same length and shared 100% identity in reverse complementation order to the trvebc2_ <dig> tvpirin cdna. another reverse-complemented clone  shared discontinuous identity with the tvpirin cdna sequences in both orientations . these observations suggest that these seven clones represent either transcripts from genes other than tvpirin or artifacts of the contig assembly. similar blast-searches in the t. versicolor ssh root tip contig libraries enriched for transcripts up-regulated by dmbq  identified two clones, contig <dig> and contig <dig>  with homologies to the 5′ and 3′ half of our tvpirin cdna sequence, respectively, and without the extended 5′utr of the trvebc2_ <dig> clone .

second, we performed rt-qpcr on total rna isolated from t. versicolor root tips following exposure to two hifs  and a non-hif , using primers chosen for amplification of either the extended 5′utr or the shorter 5′utr of the tvpirin transcripts. the shorter 5′utr amplicon displayed the same up-regulated expression pattern as the tvpirin orf amplicon, whereas the prolonged 5′utr amplicon did not show any significant up-regulation in response to either dmbq or peonidin , indicating that the extended 5′utr does not authentically belong to the tvpirin transcript.

collectively, our in silico and rt-qpcr results support that the shorter 5′utr is the bona-fide 5′utr of the full-length tvpirin cdna. consequently, the tvpirin protein contains  <dig> aa  and not  <dig> aa as previously reported 
 <cit>  . the formerly published tvpirin cdna sequence likely represents an artifact of  <dig> and illumina sequence assembly. the artifactual nature of the tvpirin trvebc2_ <dig> clone is further supported by the fact that blast searches for tvqr <dig> sequences in the t. versicolor transcriptome  did not yield any tvqr <dig> complete orf, suggesting that caution should be applied when using the t. versicolor transcriptome assembled by  <dig> and illumina sequencing methods to assign gene structures. our findings reinforce that for t. versicolor, gene annotation for individual gene studies needs a careful and thorough molecular cloning approach coupled with verification by gene expression analysis until a completely and properly annotated genome is available.

tvqr <dig> and tvpirin exhibit distinctive natural allelic diversity
the tvqr <dig> cdna , originally isolated from the same ssh library used to clone the full-length tvpirin cdna 
 <cit> , is a partial cdna clone containing the complete orf but lacking the 5′ and 3′utrs. we cloned the full-length tvqr <dig> cdna using the same procedures carried out for tvpirin as described above, and recovered  <dig> independent full-length tvqr <dig> cdna clones representing  <dig> different tvqr <dig> cdna alleles . the aforementioned  <dig> independently recovered full-length tvpirin cdna clones also corresponded to  <dig> different tvpirin cdna alleles . in order to understand the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms of these genes, we conducted a molecular population genetic analysis by using natural strains collected from a population in northern californian grasslands . we randomly selected  <dig> plants from the in vitro haustorium formation assays, of which  <dig> were responsive to dmbq ,  <dig> responsive to peonidin ,  <dig> non-responsive to dmbq , and  <dig> non-responsive to peonidin  . genomic sequences from the start codon to the stop codon were obtained for each gene from the same plant by the sanger sequencing method.

the complete alignments of all  <dig> alleles from these  <dig> plants showed sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides long for tvqr <dig> and tvpirin, respectively . we found striking differences in nucleotide diversity between the two genes. while there were only  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in tvpirin , tvqr <dig> contained  <dig> segregating sites in addition to  <dig> insertions/deletions  throughout the entire gene body, with indels present only in introns, and with the highest diversity in intron  <dig> . this confers tvqr <dig> nucleotide diversity two orders of magnitude higher than that of tvpirin. likewise, the numbers of synonymous substitutions and non-synonymous changes in tvqr <dig> are  <dig> and  <dig> times higher, respectively, than those of tvpirin . furthermore, four-gamete tests detected a higher level of recombination in tvqr <dig>  compared to tvpirin  , which might have contributed to the generation of the extremely high number of haplotypes in tvqr <dig>  in tvqr <dig>  the highest number of recombination events was estimated in the last exon . as all these individual plants came from one single population of a restricted geographical location , this high level of intra-populational variations of tvqr <dig> is even more extraordinary.

next, we examined the diversity of tvqr <dig> and tvpirin genes at the protein level by aligning the aa sequences deduced from the orfs of their genomic and full-length cdna clones. interproscan runs from swissprot for these two proteins identified the alcohol dehydrogenase  grose-like and the adh_n_ <dig> rossmann domains in tvqr <dig> , and the pirin n- and c-terminal domains in tvpirin . although the crystallized structure of the human pirin homolog revealed the β-barrel structure of the n- and c-terminal domains 
 <cit> , no biochemical functions for either domain have been identified. by contrast, in redox enzymes such as adh or quinone oxidoreductases, the adh grose-like domain is the catalytic site with the oxidoreductase activity and substrate specificity 
 <cit> , while the adh_n_ <dig> rossmann domain is the nad-binding site where the one-electron addition/reduction reaction takes place 
 <cit> –
 <cit> .

as predicted from the higher number of non-synonymous substitutions described above, the tvqr <dig> protein exhibited more aa variations than the tvpirin protein . a total of  <dig> aa changes were present in the 288-aa tvpirin protein with no preferential domain of high polymorphic level, and  <dig> of these variations belonged to rare alleles where the polymorphism occurred only once as singletons in the  <dig> deduced proteins . on the other hand, only  <dig> of the  <dig> aa variation sites in the 329-aa tvqr <dig> protein sequence were singletons among the  <dig> deduced proteins . the adh grose-like domain of tvqr <dig> presented the largest cluster of aa polymorphisms. its  <dig> changes within the 64-aa stretch  are 3-fold higher than the  <dig> changes distributed over the remaining  <dig> aa residues of the protein . notably, the other domain of tvqr <dig>  adh_n_ <dig> rossmann, contained only  <dig> changes in the 130-aa stretch , with  <dig> residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> having  <dig> and  <dig> variants, respectively . we further looked for aa changes in these two proteins that occurred exclusively in the non-responsive plants in order to identify potential mutations associated with the loss of haustorium formation phenotype. however, such changes were not found , suggesting that loss-of-function mutations could reside in the promoter and/or other regulatory elements of the genes.

collectively, these population genetic analyses revealed a remarkably higher level of molecular diversity, at both nucleotide and aa levels, of tvqr <dig> compared to tvpirin in the t. versicolor natural populations from northern california. it is noteworthy that the highest aa polymorphism in tvqr <dig> appears in the adh grose-like domain, which determines substrate specificity. thus, by analogy to the extremely divergent lrr domain of the plant resistance r genes involved in specific pathogen recognition 
 <cit> –
 <cit> , the adh grose-like domain of tvqr <dig> may have been under diversifying selection that sustains its molecular labile state in order to enable rapid changes aimed at recognizing a large variety of quinone substrates from host root exudates. at least  <dig> species belonging to  <dig> different families in both monocot and dicot clades are natural hosts of t. versicolor, and multiple hosts are often parasitized simultaneously by t. versicolor in the fields 
 <cit> . therefore, having the ability to recognize a multitude of host factors from such a wide range of hosts would confer this parasitic species an evolutionary advantage. we hypothesize that parasitic plants might have evolved a mechanism to exploit the abundant allelopathic chemicals in their environment and turn the phytotoxicity they initially encountered into a haustorium-inducing cue for their benefit. maintenance of tvqr <dig> molecular diversity could be a mechanism enabling this evolutionary process. high level of nucleotide diversity in synonymous sites as well as in non-synonymous sites of tvqr <dig> may suggest that the long-term selection has been acting on this gene, as it is expected to elevate nucleotide diversity of closely linked sites while non-synonymous sites are more likely to be the direct target of selection. those patterns are indeed observed in the plant r genes that are suggested to be under long-term balancing selection . tvpirin, on the other hand, as a transcription co-factor, probably interacts with other proteins with specific conformations for dna binding, and thus would be subject to more evolutionary constraints in order to maintain specific protein-protein interactions, which might have led to the much lower molecular diversity observed here.

CONCLUSIONS
our molecular analysis has shown that, in the natural t. versicolor populations from northern california, the only two genes known to date to be required for haustorium initiation, tvqr <dig> and tvpirin, display highly contrasting patterns of molecular polymorphisms. especially, the nucleotide diversity of tvqr <dig> is 97-times higher than that of tvpirin, suggesting that these two genes would have been subjected to different selective pressures, possibly reflecting their distinct roles in phytochemical perception during host recognition. this difference is further manifest in their differential regulation by hifs and non-hifs. since tvqr <dig> responds to both hifs and non-hifs, it might not only function in haustorium development but also in the oxidative stress response. the non-toxic hif peonidin provides a useful tool to dissect these two pathways in future search for additional parasitic plant genes involved in haustorium development. differential responses of parasitic genes under peonidin, other toxic hifs, and toxic non-hifs bear the potential to separate genes only involved in the detoxification pathway from genes specific to the haustorium signaling pathway. furthermore, although peonidin is a very effective hif in t. versicolor, its ability to induce haustoria in other parasitic plant species has not yet been investigated. how peonidin functions as a hif, e.g., with regard to its active form and receptor on the parasite, also awaits further studies. both tvqr <dig> and tvpirin genes have orthologs in non-parasitic plants. thus, further phylogenic investigations of these genes in different plant taxa might elucidate the mechanism by which parasitic plants have, during the evolutionary course from complete autotrophy to heterotrophy, co-opted a quinone oxidoreductase and a transcription co-factor from their existing genetic reservoir and adapted them to fulfill the new function of developing the organ that embodies plant parasitism: the haustorium.
