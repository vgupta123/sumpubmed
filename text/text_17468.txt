BACKGROUND
receptor tyrosine kinases  are transmembrane molecules situated at the cellular surface whose function is to detect their specific cognate ligands in the extracellular milieu. rtks are critical signal-transduction mediators that regulate many essential cellular activities including growth and differentiation. in the usual signal-transduction pathways, rtks need to relay in a stepwise manner the signals from cellular surface through other signaling molecules, such as nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases. in addition to the anticipated cellular surface localization of rtks, intriguingly, recent reports have indicated that some of these receptor kinases can be translocated inside the nucleus and may constitute newly identified biochemical signals by themselves  <cit> . these rtks include the egfr family , fgfr family , trka  <cit> , and vegfr <dig>  <cit> .

although the details of the biological functions of these nuclear translocated rtks are not understood fully, studies have indicated the unique biochemical roles of rtks when trafficked into the nucleus. membrane rtks are known to participate in the signal transduction pathways including the ras-mapk pathway, ip3/dag pathway, and pi3k pathway  <cit> . by contrast, nuclear erbbs can function as transcription modulators in addition to the protein kinase signal transducer  <cit> . for example, nuclear egfr interacts with stat <dig> or stat <dig> to transactivate the expression of the aurora-a or nitric oxide synthase  genes, respectively  <cit> . nuclear egfr can also function as a protein tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate tyr  <dig> of pcna, which increases the stability of chromatin-bound pcna protein  <cit> . several recent studies indicate that the nuclear localization of the erbb proteins can be a pathological feature in tumors such as breast carcinoma, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer tumors  <cit> .

another study of rtks showed that activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter by nuclear fgfr <dig> and its natural ligand  is mediated through the camp-responsive element  complexes in addition to the usual intermediate signaling kinase molecules  <cit> . learning more about the rtk nuclear localization process and the underlying mechanisms would lead to a better understanding of the modulatory functions of rtks in cells. in this study, we used bioinformatic tools to scan all known human rtks for their potential to localize in the nucleus, and we conducted molecular experiments to dissect the nuclear localization domain of one rtk, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor  <dig> .

in our preliminary analysis, we first predicted the potential rtk protein subcellular locations using the psort ii program. our results indicated that several additional rtks might also be capable of localizing in the nucleus, including the ror rtk family. the ror family comprises two structurally related rtk genes, ror <dig> and ror <dig>  which share an overall 58% amino acid identity. rors were first cloned from a neuroblastoma cell line using a polymerase chain reaction -based approach, which showed a region that is strongly homologous to the tyrosine kinase domain of the trk family  <cit> . rors are evolutionally conserved among caenorhabditis elegans, aplysia  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , mice  <cit> , rats, cows, dogs, chimpanzees, and humans. the ligand of ror <dig> is wnt-5a  <cit> , whereas ror <dig> remains an orphan receptor protein tyrosine kinase without any known interacting ligand molecules.

ror <dig> and ror <dig> are newly identified receptor tyrosine kinases to have function involved in development in mammalian central neurons. the rors protein accumulates in the process of synapse formation and concentrated in the growth cone of the immature neuron  <cit> . in addition, knockdown of ror <dig> or ror <dig> expression leads to a shorter and less branched neurite extension phenomenon  <cit> . some reports suggest that ror <dig> and ror <dig> have different subcellular localizations, respectively. ror <dig> associates with f-actin microfilament, whereas ror <dig> co-localizes with microtubules  <cit> . more studies are needed to reveal the biological functions of ror rtks. here, we report on the confirmation of the nuclear localization potential of this rtk family and our characterization of the critical region involved in the nuclear translocation of ror <dig> 

RESULTS
prediction of nuclear-localized rtks
to learn more about the nuclear distribution of rtks in cells, we used the psort ii program to predict the nuclear localization probabilities of all human rtks. the psort ii program was developed by dr. nakai's group  using the k-nearest-neighbor method. the k-nearest-neighbor method is a pattern-recognition algorithm in which k is a predefined parameter. the percentage of proteins whose nuclear localization sites are correctly predicted is up to  <dig> %  <cit> . protein subcellular prediction by psort ii indicated that several rtks could localize in the nucleus. table  <dig> shows the predicted nuclear-localized rtks including the egfr, fgfr, ror, vegfr, aatyk, and trk rtk families. some reports have demonstrated that members of the egfr, fgfr, vegfr, and trk families localize to the nucleus  <cit> .

based on the psort ii nncn score , the ror family rtks were considered to have good potential for nuclear localization. the nncn algorithm is used to distinguish the protein tendency to be in either the nucleus or the cytoplasm based on its amino acid composition  <cit> . we also performed further prediction analysis using other bioinformatics tools . these bioinformatics tools employ a range of different algorithms to perform the prediction: subnuclear is based on the amino acid composition and uses the dipeptide and tripeptide encoding method; eslpred is based on the physicochemical properties, amino acid composition, and dipeptide composition of proteins; subloc is based on the amino acid composition; and nppred is based on the amino acid, dipeptide, and split composition of proteins. all programs supported the concept that the cytoplasmic region of ror <dig> protein has a good nuclear localization potential . encouraged by the in silico prediction results, we decided to further examine the cellular expression distribution of the ror proteins in vivo.

ror rtk expression in various cell lines
because ror <dig> is an orphan receptor about which little is known, we first examined the expression pattern of endogenous ror <dig> in various human tumor cell lines of different tissue origins. specific pcr primers were designed to amplify a fragment  of the ror <dig> transcript . our screening result identified ht- <dig> colon cancer cells having the highest ror <dig> mrna expression level . further examination of human colorectal cancer samples revealed higher expression of ror <dig> in colorectal cancer tissues than in adjacent normal colon tissues . in most of the cell lines examined, ror <dig> seemed to have a higher or similar expression level compared with ror <dig>  except in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells.

determination of nuclear localization domain of the cytoplasmic region of ror1
to explore the nuclear localization potential of the ror <dig> cytoplasmic region, we first generated plasmid chimeric fusion constructs  containing hcred fluorescent tag protein and the cytoplasmic region of either ror <dig>  or ror <dig>  . the localization of the fusion proteins was assessed by detecting the far-red fluorescence emitted by the hcred fusion protein tags. the hcred control vector showed an overall homogenous distribution pattern. by contrast, the ror <dig> and ror <dig> fusion proteins showed a nuclear localization pattern following transfection . the hcred-ror <dig> fusion protein had a unique patched subnuclear localization pattern in cells, whereas the hcred-ror <dig> protein showed a more homogenous nuclear localization pattern. our data confirmed that the cytoplasmic regions of ror <dig> and ror <dig> rtks contain putative nuclear localization signal domains. because of the good homology between ror <dig> and ror <dig>  we selected the ror <dig> gene for subsequent experiments.

because of the weak but noticeable nuclear expression pattern of hcred protein in the control vector, we opted to switch to the human influenza hemagglutinin -tag vector for subsequent studies. to further dissect the domains responsible for the nuclear localization of ror <dig>  we constructed several ror <dig> deletion constructs fused with the ha tag . ror1f <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids of the n-terminal ror <dig> cytoplasmic region, ror1f <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids of the c-terminal ror <dig> cytoplasmic region, and ror1f <dig> and ror1f <dig> contained the ror <dig> cytoplasmic region with the deletion of the n-terminal  <dig> residues and  <dig> residues, respectively. ror1f <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids, and ror1f <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids. following transfection, proper expression of each deletion construct was verified by immunoblot analysis .

the subcellular protein distributions of these ror <dig> deletion constructs were identified using confocal microscopic analysis . as expected, the fusion construct containing the full-length cytoplasmic region of ror <dig> localized mainly in the nucleus. the negative control plasmid construct carrying the ha-pkm <dig>  fusion protein showed only the cytoplasmic distribution pattern. among the deletion constructs, the ror1f <dig> fragment  localized mainly in the nucleus. by contrast, the ror1f <dig> fragment  localized only in the cytoplasm. similarly, the ror1f <dig> fragment  also showed a reduced nuclear localization pattern compared with the full cytoplasmic ror <dig> construct or ror1f <dig> fragment. by contrast, ror1f <dig>  restored the ability to localize in the nucleus. the ror1f <dig> fragment was constructed by adding the 471- <dig> amino acid sequence to the n-terminal of the ror1f <dig> fragment. these data suggest that the 471- <dig> amino acid sequence may be responsible for the observed nuclear localization capability of ror <dig> rtk.

because ror <dig> was reported to interact with the cytoskeleton and because it colocalizes with f-actin during stress fiber formation, we then used rhodamine phalloidin to examine the actin stress fiber formation in these serial deletion constructs. the pericytoplasmic membrane localization of ror <dig> fusion proteins and colocalization with f-actin stress fiber were observed in ha-cyto. ror <dig>  construct. the ratio of nuclear distribution of each ror <dig> deletion construct was calculated by quantitatively determining the mean percentage of fluorescein isothiocyanate  fluorescence intensity from  <dig> randomly selected cells using the metamorph analysis program  . in brief, our result suggested that the 471- <dig> amino acid motif located within the juxtamembrane domain is the region responsible for the observed nuclear translocation activity. this region is called ror <dig> nldomain hereafter.

because no typical nls signal peptide sequences are found readily in the ror <dig> cytoplasmic region, we examined this region for other possible motifs. typically, this nls comprises one or more short sequences of positively charged lysines or arginines. the ror <dig> nldomain does contain a kxxk- <dig> aa-kxxk bipartite basic charged amino acid pattern. to confirm that this region is truly responsible for the ror <dig> nuclear localization, we tried to mutate the four lysines into alanines within this nldomain region. residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were mutated accordingly . the ror <dig> nuclear localization was abolished in the mutant constructs examined , suggesting that all four lysine residues are important to the ror <dig> nuclear distribution pattern. our results suggest that the nldomain located at the juxtamembrane  region of the ror <dig> cytoplasmic domain contributes to the nuclear translocation function.

nuclear translocation of ror <dig> might be mediated by the rangtp pathway
the nucleotide-bound state of the small gtpase ran plays a key role in nuclear transport  <cit> . we examined the possible involvement of such a pathway in the transportation of ror <dig> rtk into the nucleus. a dominant-negative mutant of ran , which is deficient in gtpase activity, prevents the nuclear import of target proteins  <cit> . confocal immunofluorescence analysis showed increased expression of the ror <dig> fusion protein in the nucleus of cells cotransfected with wild-type ran protein but not in cells cotransfected with the control vector. by contrast, the dominant-negative ranq69l mutant showed reduced nuclear localization of ror <dig> fusion protein . quantification of the ror <dig> fusion protein distribution in transfected cells showed that ran gtpase plays a major role in the nuclear translocation of ror <dig> rtk .

discussion
in this study, we reported that the cytoplasmic region of the transmembrane rtk ror <dig> was able to translocate into the nucleus. this nuclear distribution pattern was similar to that of trka rtk. trka is a nerve growth factor receptor that shows a predominant nuclear and perinuclear localization resembling the small dense core carrier vesicles  <cit> . we also observed that cytoplasmic ror <dig> formed a number of dense particles near the outer nuclear membrane. interestingly, ror <dig> was originally cloned from the homologous cytoplasmic region of trka. the role of the juxtamembrane 471- <dig> region of ror <dig> in determining the nuclear localization identified in this study response to the role of the intracellular portion of trka. this conclusion is supported by the evidence showing that nuclear trka is recognized only by antibodies against the intracellular region but not by antibodies against the extracellular domain  <cit> .

the juxtamembrane regions of the egfr family are critical for the nuclear localization of their proteins. the putative nls in the juxtamembrane domain is conserved among the egfr family. for example, the putative egfr nls sequence is aa_669-rrrhivrkrtlrr  <cit> , the putative erbb <dig> nls sequence is aa_676-krrqqkirkytmrr  <cit> , the putative erbb- <dig> nls sequence is aa_669-rrqkqnkramrr, and the putative erbb- <dig> nls sequence is aa_676-rrkqsikkkralrr  <cit> . we discovered that the 471- <dig> motif of ror <dig> also localizes to the juxtamembrane domain, implying that the nuclear translocation of rtks might be mechanistically similar. however, there is no traditional nuclear-localized signal sequence such as in the egfr cases. we found the kxxk- <dig> aa-kxxk bipartite pattern in this region and showed that it is functional in ror <dig> nuclear localization. the 3d-structure modeling of the cytoplasmic part of ror <dig> showed that the mapped ror <dig> juxtamembrane 471- <dig> region is exposed at the outer part of the molecule, implying a greater opportunity to be recognized by interacting proteins .

nuclear localized rtks are found to be present as full-length protein  or proteolytic cytoplasmic fragments   <cit> . in the case of erbb- <dig> rtk, it is cleaved by the metalloprotease and gamma-secretase following the binding of its ligand  <cit> . the cleaved cytoplasmic region of erbb- <dig> is then translocated into the nucleus. this process is similar to the one operated in the notch signaling pathway  <cit> . in this study, our attempts to detect the endogenous ror <dig> expression using rat-anti ror <dig> antibody showed a small truncated form of ror <dig>  in several cancer cell lines . the level of this possible truncated fragment was diminished in subsequent si-ror <dig> knockdown experiments. we propose that ror <dig> is translocated into the nucleus and that this translocation is mediated by the cleavage-releasing mechanism in addition to the ran gtpase pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
our study showed that the cytoplasmic region of ror <dig> might be localized in the nucleus in human cancer cell lines. following the analysis using deletion constructs, the juxtamembrane domain comprising 471- <dig> residues of ror <dig> was determined to be responsible for nuclear translocation. the nuclear localization of ror <dig> was enhanced further by cotransfection of ran wild-type protein but not by the mutant construct.
