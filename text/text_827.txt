BACKGROUND
chronic exposure to opioid agonist drugs, such as morphine and heroin, leads to opioid dependence. opioid agonists cause pronounced changes in neuronal structure and synaptic organization, and these may contribute to the drug craving, compulsive drug use, and analgesic tolerance that characterize the addictive state  <cit> . many of these changes reflect inhibitory growth effects of morphine and other opioid agonists on neuron size, neurite outgrowth, dendritic arborization, and neurogenesis that occur in brain regions important for reward processing, learning, and memory  <cit> . however, the specific molecular mechanisms that link opioid agonist activity to the neuronal alterations observed in opioid dependence remain enigmatic.

most clinically relevant opioid agonists provide analgesia via activation of mu-opioid receptors , which are members of the g-protein coupled receptor  superfamily  <cit> . in many individuals, mor activation also produces a euphoric effect, which is often considered the primary impetus  for abusing opioid drugs  <cit> . mor knockout mice display significantly reduced sensitivity to both the analgesic and rewarding effects of opioids, thus confirming the importance of the mor in analgesia and opioid dependence  <cit> . mors, like most gpcrs, are regulated by multiple mechanisms including receptor desensitization, internalization, degradation, and recycling  <cit> . a number of studies have shown that mor desensitization and trafficking represent key aspects in the development of opioid tolerance and dependence  <cit> . elucidating the mechanisms that regulate mor signaling and trafficking is therefore critical for determining the physiological basis of opioid dependence and enhancing opioid receptor pharmacology for the treatment of pain and addiction.

a growing body of evidence indicates that gpcr signaling is modulated by proteins that bind to the gpcr and form multiprotein signaling complexes or signalplexes  <cit> . a number of proteins that interact directly with the mu-opioid receptor have recently been identified and shown to affect mor biogenesis, trafficking, and signaling  <cit> . for example, periplakin, protein kinase c interactor <dig> , and filamin a have all been found to bind to the c-terminal intracellular tail of the mor. periplakin inhibits g-protein activation when mor is bound by an agonist  <cit> , while pcki <dig> inhibits agonist-induced phosphorylation of mor by g-protein coupled receptor kinase  <dig>  <cit> . after phosphorylation of mor, beta-arrestin  <dig> binds and mediates mor internalization  <cit> . filamin a, on the other hand, serves to anchor mor to the cytoskeleton by forming a cross-bridge with actin  <cit> .

to gain a better understanding of the potential role of mor interacting proteins  in mediating opioid dependence, we propose to delineate novel constituents of the mor signalplex. using a modified split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid approach  <cit> , we identified gpr <dig>  a putative orphan gpcr, as a morip. several recent studies have shown that gpr <dig> is the mammalian ortholog of drosophila wntless/evi/sprinter, an evolutionarily conserved protein that plays an important role in secretion of wnt proteins from wnt-producing cells  <cit> . wnt signaling mechanisms are of particular interest due to their effects on neuronal development  <cit> . we find that in mor-expressing hek <dig> cells, morphine treatment promotes formation of mor/gpr <dig> complexes. this in turn results in sequestration of gpr <dig> and inhibition of wnt protein secretion. defining the constituents of the mor signalplex thus represents a critical step in understanding the mechanisms of mor-mediated signaling and the molecular mechanisms underlying opioid dependence.

RESULTS
interaction of the μ-opioid receptor  with gpr177
to identify novel mor interacting proteins , we performed a modified split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid  screen  <cit>  using the full-length mor as bait. the myth screen uses the split-ubiquitin approach, in which the reconstitution of two ubiquitin halves is mediated by a specific protein-protein interaction  <cit> . we screened  <dig> ×  <dig> colonies and isolated  <dig> positive clones representing  <dig> distinct human proteins. two of them were found to encode the c-terminal domain of gpr <dig> . gpr <dig> is the mammalian ortholog of drosophila wntless/evi/sprinter, a putative multi-pass membrane-spanning protein that is involved in regulating secretion of wnt proteins from wnt producing cells  <cit> .

because the split-ubiquitin screen we conducted utilized the entire coding region of the mor as bait, this approach provided no information regarding the physical location of gpr <dig> binding sites on the receptor. we therefore used a directed yeast-two hybrid  assay to further test for mor/gpr <dig> interactions and to map the location of gpr <dig> binding sites on the mor. each of the mor intracellular loops , including the c-terminal domain , were used separately as baits to screen for interaction with the gpr <dig> clone identified in the initial split-ubiquitin screen. these mapping studies, shown in figure  <dig>  indicate that gpr <dig> interacts only with the second intracellular loop  of the mor. we also used the y2h system to examine the specificity of the mor/gpr <dig> interaction. in control experiments, the empty prey vector  did not cause autologous activation of the reporter gene. gpr <dig> did not interact with the second intracellular loop of the d <dig> dopamine receptor , which shares sequence homology with the moril <dig> at five of  <dig> positions. calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion , a previously identified d2ic2-specific binding protein  <cit> , interacted only with the d2ic <dig>  but not with any of the mor intracellular domains . these results indicate that gpr <dig> interacts specifically with the moril <dig> domain in the yeast system.

to validate the interaction between gpr <dig> and the mor, we tested the ability of gpr <dig> to associate with a moril2-gst fusion protein in a pulldown assay. as shown in figure 2a, a western blot containing lysate from bacteria expressing an s-tagged gpr <dig> cdna fragment  produced an immunoreactive band of ~ <dig> kda when probed with anti-s-tag antibodies. this band corresponds to the expected size of the c-terminal gpr <dig> fragment encoded by the cdna construct. the same band was detected by pulldown after the bacterial lysate was incubated with the moril2-gst fusion protein, but not when the lysate was absorbed onto beads alone or gst-coated beads.

the interaction between full-length mor and gpr <dig> was verified in co-immunoprecipitation  experiments. to demonstrate interaction, we tested the ability of an anti-mor antibody to coimmunoprecipitate gpr <dig> from lysates prepared from hek <dig> cells stably expressing flag-tagged mors  and transiently transfected with a flag/6× his-tagged gpr <dig> construct. 293-mor cells were a generous gift from dr. mark von zastrow . preliminary western blot analysis  revealed that the anti-mor antibody specifically immunoprecipitated  the mu-opioid receptor from 293-mor cells. lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using the anti-mor antibody, and immunocomplexes probed with chicken anti-gpr <dig> antibodies. as shown in figure 2b, an immunoreactive band of ~ <dig> kda, the predicted size of gpr <dig>  was detected in lysates prepared from transfected cells with the anti-gpr <dig> antibody. a band migrating with the identical molecular mass was detected in the ip lane, but not in ips from cells lacking mor expression , ips from 293-mor cells not transfected with gpr <dig> , or mock ips . the specificity of the anti-gpr <dig> antisera was ascertained by transfecting a flag/6× his-tagged gpr <dig> cdna into hek <dig> cells. a western blot containing lysate prepared from transfected cells was first probed with anti-flag antibodies, then stripped and reprobed with anti-gpr <dig> antibodies. a band migrating with the identical molecular mass was detected with anti-flag and anti-gpr <dig> antibodies , indicating that the gpr <dig> antibodies react specifically with gpr <dig> 

to examine the specificity of the mor/gpr <dig> interaction, we asked whether gpr <dig> could be coimmunoprecipitated from 293-d2r cells. 293-d2r cells  stably express flag-tagged d2rs but not the mor, and endogenously express gpr <dig>  as shown in figure 2c, when lysates from 293-mor cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibodies and immunocomplexes probed with the anti-gpr <dig> antibody, we detected an immunoreactive band of ~ <dig> kda. this band corresponds to the size expected for endogenously expressed gpr <dig> . in contrast, when lysates prepared from 293-d2r cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibodies, we were unable to detect any immunoreactive bands corresponding to gpr <dig> when the immunocomplexes were probed using anti-gpr <dig> antibodies. taken together, our data strongly suggests that gpr <dig> interacts specifically with the mor through the interaction of the carboxy-terminus of gpr <dig> with the second intracellular loop of the mor. in the future, direct binding of these two proteins can be established using biophysical-type approaches.

mor and gpr <dig> interact in pc <dig> cells and rat brain
to further characterize the gpr177/mor interaction, we examined expression of gpr <dig> in rat pheochromocytoma  cells and rat brain. western blotting experiments revealed endogenous expression of gpr <dig> polypeptides in pc <dig> cell and rat brain lysates , while pc <dig> cells have previously been shown to express mors  <cit> . coip experiments were therefore performed to test whether endogenously expressed gpr <dig> and mors are associated in pc <dig> cells and rat brain. to do this, mors were immunoprecipitated from either pc <dig> cells or rat brain with anti-mor antibodies, and immunocomplexes probed for the presence of gpr <dig>  in pc <dig> cells, anti-gpr <dig> antibodies reacted with an ~ <dig> kda band in the lysate and ip lanes, but not in mock immunoprecipitations in which anti-mor antibodies were omitted . in rat brain, western blot analysis revealed the presence of an ~ <dig> kda band in the lysate and ip lanes, but not in mock immunoprecipitations or immunoprecipitations using non-specific anti-flag antibodies . these results indicate that endogenously expressed gpr <dig> and mors interact in pc <dig> cells as well as rat brain.

mor and gpr <dig> colocalize in striatal neurons
we next used a combination of immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy to analyze the cellular and subcellular distribution of gpr <dig> and the mor in mouse striatum. in double-labeling experiments with anti-gpr <dig> and anti-mor antibodies, somatodendritic processes exhibiting coexpression of gpr <dig>  and mor  proteins were localized to common cellular profiles in striatum . these observations suggest that gpr <dig> colocalizes with the mor in a subpopulation of striatal neurons.

double immunoelectron microscopic analysis was used to gain insight into the subcellular distribution of gpr <dig> and the mor. for these ultrastructural studies, peroxidase labeling was used to localize mors and immunogold-silver labeling was used to localize gpr <dig>  as shown in figure 4d, peroxidase labeling for the mor was visualized as a diffuse reaction product that was associated with the plasmalemma and cytoplasmic portions of dendritic processes. gpr <dig> immunoreactivity, visualized as irregularly shaped black deposits indicative of immunogold-silver labeled particles , exhibited a predominantly cytoplasmic localization.

expression of gpr <dig> and the mor in striatal sections was also analyzed using dual immunogold labeling. as shown in figure 4e-f, the mor was identified by large  immunogold-silver particles and gpr <dig> by smaller  immunogold-silver particles. in double-labeling experiments, gpr <dig> and mor immunoreactivity was found in some cases to colocalize in perikarya  and in dendritic processes . within double-labeled structures, some of the immunometal particles representing mor and gpr <dig> were situated in close proximity to one another either in the cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane. taken together, our immunofluorescence data indicate that gpr <dig> and mors are coexpressed within the same striatal neuron. the close spatial proximity of the mor and gpr <dig> revealed by immunoelectron microscopy provides additional evidence supporting an interaction between these two proteins within neurons.

exposure to opioid agonists promotes formation of mor/gpr <dig> complexes
to investigate the effect of opioid agonists on mor/gpr <dig> complex formation, we first used confocal laser microscopy to examine the distribution of mor and gpr <dig> polypeptides in 293-mor cells treated with  <dig> μm morphine for one hour. in untreated and morphine-treated 293-mor cells, mors were localized predominantly at the plasma membrane . in both untreated and morphine-treated cells, staining for gpr <dig> was also detected at the periphery, although a considerable amount of gpr <dig> staining appeared cytosolic . in cells treated with morphine, we observed an increase in mor/gpr <dig> colocalization , suggesting that morphine treatment may cause an increase in the association between the mor and gpr <dig>  the distribution of mor and gpr <dig> polypeptides in cells treated with  <dig> μm damgo, however, was considerably different. after a one hour exposure period, both the mor  and gpr <dig>  appeared to be internalized and staining was predominantly cytosolic. the merged image  indicates that the bulk of mor/gpr <dig> complexes colocalized within cytosolic compartments.

to examine the effect of opioid agonists on the mor/gpr <dig> interaction in greater detail, we used coimmunoprecipitation to investigate whether opioid treatment promotes mor/gpr <dig> complex formation. in these experiments, 293-mor cells were exposed to  <dig> μm morphine or  <dig> μm damgo for one hour. total cellular lysates were prepared, and the mor immunoprecipitated using an anti-mor antibody. immunocomplexes were then probed for gpr <dig> with chicken anti-gpr <dig> antibody. as shown in figure 5b, mors were associated with gpr <dig> under basal conditions, and mor/gpr <dig> complex formation appeared to be significantly increased after treatment with morphine or damgo. morphine-induced mor/gpr <dig> complex formation was not accompanied by an increase in expression of gpr <dig> polypeptides . together, these results suggest that both morphine and damgo increase mor/gpr <dig> complex formation. further, morphine treatment appears to cause a shift in the distribution of gpr <dig> from cytosol to the cell surface. this redistribution permits enhanced mor/gpr <dig> complex formation at the cell periphery. damgo, on the other hand, results in mor internalization, thus leading to an increased association between the mor and gpr <dig> within the cytosol.

effect of mor/gpr <dig> interaction on wnt secretion
recent studies have shown that gpr <dig> plays an essential role in mediating wnt protein secretion from wnt-producing cells  <cit> . we therefore wished to determine whether the interaction between gpr <dig> and mor might contribute to the regulation of wnt secretion. to test this idea, we examined wnt secretion utilizing hek <dig> cells, which do not normally express wnt proteins, but do secrete wnt polypeptides after transient transfection with wnt cdna  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> , wild-type hek <dig>  293-mor, and 293-d2r cells are all capable of secreting wnt <dig> polypeptides after transient transfection with myc-tagged wnt <dig> cdna. treatment of wild-type hek <dig> cells with morphine or damgo produced no significant effect on wnt <dig> secretion compared to untreated cells . however, treatment of 293-mor cells with morphine produced a significant decrease in wnt <dig> secretion compared to untreated controls . the inhibition of wnt secretion appears to be specific to the activation of mors by morphine, since damgo did not affect wnt <dig> secretion from 293-mor cells . further, dopamine treatment did not significantly affect wnt <dig> secretion from d <dig> dopamine receptor-expressing 293-d2r cells .

we next asked whether the morphine-mediated inhibition of wnt <dig> secretion could be reversed by overexpression of gpr <dig>  to do this, we cotransfected 293-mor cells with myc-tagged wnt <dig> and gpr <dig> cdnas, and monitored wnt <dig> secretion in cells grown in the presence or absence of morphine. as shown in figure 6d, morphine treatment caused a significant inhibition of wnt <dig> secretion compared to untreated controls. however, overexpression of gpr <dig> in morphine-treated 293-mor cells produced a dramatic increase in wnt <dig> secretion. taken together, the data from these experiments strongly suggests that morphine treatment specifically blocks wnt secretion from mor expressing cells, and that this inhibition can be overcome by overexpression of gpr <dig> 

to confirm that the inhibition of wnt <dig> secretion by morphine is regulated through the mu-opioid receptor, we tested the ability of the potent mor antagonists ctap  <cit>  and naloxone  <cit> , to block the morphine-mediated effect. in these experiments, 293-mor cells were pretreated with either ctap or naloxone for one hour prior to the addition of morphine and the initiation of the secretion assay. as shown in figure  <dig>  pretreatment with either ctap or naloxone reversed the morphine-mediated inhibition of wnt <dig> secretion. these results provide compelling evidence that the morphine-mediated inhibition of wnt <dig> secretion is regulated via the mu-opioid receptor.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that mu-opioid receptors  can functionally interact with gpr <dig>  an evolutionarily conserved protein that mediates wnt protein secretion in a variety of species including flies, worms, frogs, rodents, and humans  <cit> . through its interaction with the mor, gpr <dig> appears to play an important physiological role in neuronal response to opioid agonists. this interpretation is based on the following conclusions. first, the mor/gpr <dig> interaction occurs within neurons. second, the association between these two proteins is enhanced by morphine treatment. third, an increase in the interaction between the mor and gpr <dig> results in the inhibition of wnt secretion. these findings shed new light on the role of morips in the neurobiology of opioid agonist actions, and offer a mechanism whereby chronic opioid agonist exposure may produce deleterious effects on neuronal structure and function via inhibition of wnt secretion.

the interaction between the mor and gpr <dig> was initially uncovered in a myth screen and then validated in gst-pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. to our knowledge, this represents the first successful myth screen using a full-length human gpcr as bait. the potential physiological relevance of the mor/gpr <dig> interaction is borne out by the data in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the coimmunoprecipitation results presented in figure  <dig> indicate that mors and gpr <dig> endogenously expressed within cultured cells and brain tissue are capable of interacting with each other. the double-label light and immunoelectron microscopic analysis shown in figure  <dig> further establish that mor and gpr <dig> are coexpressed within a subset of striatal neurons. the close spatial proximity of mor and gpr <dig> immunoreactivity within perikarya and dendrites provides compelling evidence for an interaction between these two proteins within striatal neurons. since gpr <dig> and mor are widely expressed in rodent and human brain  it is likely that the mor/gpr <dig> interaction occurs in many brain regions.

our analysis of the effect of opioid agonists on mor/gpr <dig> complex formation, together with the wnt secretion experiments, indicate that the mor/gpr <dig> interaction is likely to be of importance for understanding the changes that occur in brain after chronic opioid use. we now propose a model  in which the mor/gpr <dig> interaction regulates the secretion of wnt proteins that are required for neuronal development and morphogenesis. this model is based on the following lines of evidence. gpr <dig> is a protein that mediates wnt secretion in a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species  <cit> . gpr <dig> has also been shown to regulate wnt secretion in cultured drosophila and mammalian cells  <cit> . using immunohistochemistry and coimmunoprecipitation, we found that the level of mor/gpr <dig> complexes was significantly increased after treatment of 293-mor cells with morphine. this observation is consistent with data reported in other systems. in mice, for example, opioid agonist activation of mor causes a significant increase in the association of mor with spinophilin, a dendritic spine-enriched scaffold protein  <cit> .

our data indicate that mor and gpr <dig> are binding partners, and their association with one another occurs in cytosolic compartments as well as at the cell surface. gpr <dig> has previously been shown to interact with wnt proteins in the golgi, and the two proteins traffic together to the plasma membrane where wnt proteins are then secreted  <cit> . gpr <dig> is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recycled back to the golgi via the retromer complex  <cit> . in the wnt secretion experiments we performed, treatment of wild-type hek <dig> cells with either morphine or damgo produced no significant effect on wnt secretion compared to untreated control cells . in untreated 293-mor cells , the mor/gpr <dig> interaction that takes place under basal conditions does not appear to interfere either with the ability of gpr <dig> to mediate wnt secretion nor with normal gpr <dig> trafficking.

when cells are treated with morphine, however, the situation is quite different. our results indicate that morphine application appears to cause a redistribution of gpr <dig> from cytosol to the cell surface and enhanced mor/gpr <dig> complex formation at the cell periphery. in morphine-treated 293-mor cells, this leads to an inhibition of wnt secretion . since it is well established that morphine application leads to delayed mor internalization  <cit> , we hypothesize that the morphine-enhanced interaction between mor and gpr <dig> causes entrapment of gpr <dig> at the cell surface, effectively sequestering gpr <dig> and inhibiting its proper function in mediating wnt secretion. we propose that when mor is bound to gpr <dig>  gpr <dig> is unable to shuttle wnt proteins between the golgi and the cell surface . however, as has been shown previously, damgo application leads to fast internalization of mors  <cit> . thus, damgo treatment may allow for rapid internalization of gpr <dig>  in our model , we propose that following damgo treatment, mor/gpr <dig> complexes internalize from clathrin-coated pits into early endosomes. after internalization, mor/gpr <dig> complexes dissociate, and gpr <dig> is recycled to the golgi via association with the retromer complex. in the golgi, gpr <dig> is able to associate with wnt proteins that are then targeted to the plasma membrane for secretion  <cit> . because gpr <dig> cycling is likely to be maintained in the presence of damgo, there is no significant effect of damgo on wnt secretion.

our data demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for gpr <dig>  a novel morip, in regulating cellular response to opioid agonist drugs. morphine treatment induces cell-surface associated mor/gpr <dig> complex formation which in turn inhibits wnt protein secretion. wnt proteins have been known for some time to play an essential role in morphological patterning during development  <cit> . new roles for these proteins have also been discovered in stem cell maintenance  <cit> , cancer biology  <cit> , as well as neuronal development  <cit>  and synaptic remodeling  <cit> . in brain, wnt <dig> has been shown to regulate neurogenesis in hippocampus  <cit> , while wnt7b mediates dendritic arborization  <cit> . these processes are known to be severely compromised after chronic morphine exposure  <cit> . our discovery of an interaction between the mor and gpr <dig> may thus represent an important conceptual breakthrough in understanding the mechanism whereby opioid agonist drugs produce these profound morphological changes in brain. the loss of dendritic arborization and/or neurogenesis may be key to understanding the myriad problems associated with opioid use including addiction, cognitive dysfunction, depression, and impaired visual and motor skills. clearly, the ability to determine the influence of gpr <dig> on the acute and chronic actions of opioids will require the development of appropriate mouse models in which the effect of disrupting the gpr <dig> gene can be analyzed in behavioral paradigms of opioid agonist action. the molecular actions of gpr <dig> suggest that it could serve as a novel drug target that could be utilized to promote analgesia while preventing the deleterious neuronal alterations that accompany chronic opioid agonist use.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrate an interaction between the mor and gpr <dig>  an evolutionarily conserved protein that regulates secretion of wnt proteins in wnt-producing cells. the interaction between these two binding partners is enhanced by treatment of cells with opioid agonist drugs, and results in the inhibition of wnt protein secretion. based on these findings, we propose a model in which opioid agonist inhibition of wnt protein secretion is responsible for the loss of dendritic arborization and neurogenesis that occurs after chronic opioid exposure. these findings suggest a previously unrecognized role for gpr <dig> in regulating cellular response to opioid agonist drugs, and could create new avenues of investigation regarding the pharmacotherapy of drug dependence.
