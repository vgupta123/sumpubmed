BACKGROUND
fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, which is mediated predominantly by the ampa subtype of glutamate receptors, can undergo long-term bi-directional modifications in strength  <cit> . these persistent changes have been proposed to be key synaptic processes involved in learning and memory. the best characterised form of bi-directional synaptic plasticity is ltp / ltd of glutamatergic transmission in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus. although there has been intensive investigation of the induction and expression of ltp and ltd , the precise molecular mechanisms by which these alterations in synaptic strength occur remain unclear. possible mechanisms could be presynaptic such as changes in the release process , and / or postsynaptic , such as a change in the number of ampa receptors  available to bind transmitter, or in the properties of existing receptors .

recent studies have provided information on the possible mechanisms underlying postsynaptic alterations in synaptic strength. there is evidence that ampa receptors are inserted into the postsynaptic membrane during ltp  <cit>  and removed from the synapse upon induction of ltd  <cit> . however, it has also been shown that ltp can involve a rapid increase in γ of existing ampa receptors  <cit> . this could be caused by a ca2+/calmodulin-kinase ii -mediated phosphorylation of glur <dig> which occurs during ltp  <cit> , and which causes an increase in γ of glur <dig> homomers in transfected cells  <cit> . therefore, another potential mechanism for ltd could be a decrease in γ caused by a dephosphorylation of ampars.

we have recently used peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis  of synaptic currents recorded from ca <dig> pyramidal cell dendrites  <cit> , to investigate the molecular basis of de novo ltd . in these studies, ltd was never associated with a change in γ  <cit> . indeed, evidence was presented that the underlying mechanism involved a reduction in the number of surface expressed ampa receptors .

in the present study we have investigated a second form of ltd known as depotentiation , which is a reversal of pre-established ltp  <cit> . ltp can be associated with either an increase in γ  or no change in γ   <cit> . we were, therefore, interested to determine whether dp of ltpγ involved a decrease in γ and hence whether γ is a bi-directionally modifiable parameter. we find a reciprocal relationship between ltp and dp, such that dp of ltpγ invariably involves a restoration of the pre-ltp γ  whereas dp of ltpn never involves a change in γ . these data show, firstly, that there are two distinct molecular mechanisms for the reduction of synaptic strength that are dependent on the nature of the preceding ltp and, secondly, that γ can indeed be bi-directionally modified in response to synaptic activity.

RESULTS
using whole-cell recordings from the proximal apical dendrites of hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal cells, minimal stimulation of nearby afferents evoked epscs that could be reliably resolved from failures . these high resolution recordings enabled both a failures analysis to be performed  <cit>  and, using non-sfa, an estimate of γ of synaptically-activated ampars to be obtained  <cit> .

ltp
to investigate the mechanism of dp, ltp was first induced in  <dig> cells by pairing afferent stimulation  with a holding potential of  <dig> mv. this resulted in stable ltp .

in agreement with a previous study  <cit> , cells fell into two groups with respect to changes  in γ of ampa receptor channels during ltp. in the majority of cases , ltp was associated with an increase in γ . in the other  <dig> cells there was no increase in γ during ltp , indicating that there was an increase in the functional number of channels activated . as noted previously  <cit> , there were no differences between the two groups of neurons with respect to a variety of baseline parameters.

depotentiation of ltpγ
for this group of cells, dp, induced by pairing stimulation  with a holding potential of - <dig> mv, always resulted in a reversal of the γ increase, as indicated by the current-variance plot . similar to the preceding ltpγ, this form of dp  was also associated with no change in epsc kinetics . failures analysis showed that dpγ was associated with a decrease in success rate in most cells  and a full reversal of the potency increase . these data show that the primary mechanism for dp is the reversal of any increase in γ caused by ltp. indeed, the changes in γ were sufficient to account for the potency changes during both ltpγ and dpγ. .

depotentiation of ltpn
in contrast to dpγ, dp in these cells was never associated with a change in γ . there was also no change in epsc kinetics with ltp or dp . failures analysis of ltpn and dpn  showed similar changes to the ltpγ group of cells in epsc amplitude , success rate  and potency . these data suggest that there is a second mechanism for dp, not involving a decrease in γ, which co-exists at ca <dig> synapses. therefore, there are two mechanisms for the expression of dp that depend upon the expression mechanism of the previous potentiation.

role of nmda receptors in depotentiation
it has been shown previously that dp at ca <dig> synapses may be blocked either by nmda receptor antagonists  <cit>  or by mglu receptor antagonists  <cit>  and that this may depend on previous history  <cit> . in the present study we wished to focus on nmda receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and therefore used pairing protocols designed to activate nmda receptors sufficiently to, firstly, induce nmda receptor-dependent ltp and, secondly, to induce nmda receptor-dependent dp. to verify that we were indeed investigating nmda receptor-dependent dp we performed a series of experiments using the nmda receptor antagonist d-ap <dig> interleaved with control experiments. following the induction of ltp, d-ap <dig>  was bath applied for  <dig> minutes before delivering the dp induction stimulus. whilst dp was induced in the control experiments  it was blocked by d-ap <dig> .

relationship of changes in success rate, potency and γ to the magnitude of dp
to gain further insights into the underlying mechanisms of dp we compared changes in epsc amplitude, success rate, potency and γ for the individual experiments . a decrease in success rate indicates a reduction in probability of transmitter release  and/or a reduction in the number of functional synapses . a decrease in potency indicates a reduction in quantal amplitude  or, if multiple synapses are activated, a reduction in pr or n.

in both types of neuron , a small depression of less than  <dig> %  was associated with no change in success rate  but an equivalent decrease in potency , as is also observed for de novo ltd  <cit> ). this indicates that the depression in these cells was associated primarily with a decrease in q. for larger depressions  there was also a marked decrease in success rate  as well as a decrease in potency . this suggests that in these cells there was an additional decrease in pr or n. therefore, for dpγ, the change in γ did not fully account for the amplitude change in every cell  but did account for the potency change .

discussion
in this study we have shown that there are two mechanisms for nmda receptor-dependent dp, a reduction in γ  and a decrease in the number of activated ampa receptors . as reported previously for different data sets from this age of rats  <cit>  there are two forms of ltp; in approximately two-thirds of neurons ltp was associated with an increase in γ  whilst in the remainder there was no change in γ . in the present study we saw a similar proportion of ltp expressed by changes in γ versus n. strikingly, we observed a precise relationship between the mechanism of dp and the form of preceding ltp; ltpγ was always reversed by dpγ, and ltpn was always reversed by dpn.

in some experiments, induction of dp caused a decrease in epsc amplitude below the initial baseline. this is most likely due to the simultaneous induction of dp and de novo ltd since in slices taken from juvenile animals, de novo ltd is readily induced by this  <cit>  and other  <cit>  induction protocols. this is in contrast to previous experiments using adult tissue in which dp induction depressed synaptic responses only as far as the initial baseline and where the same induction protocol was unable to induce de novo ltd  <cit> . analysis of the mechanism of de novo ltd under the present experimental conditions demonstrated that it was associated with no change in γ  <cit> . therefore the coexistence of dp and de novo ltd does not interfere with the analysis of dpγ.

in addition, there is sometimes a small, gradual run-down of synaptic responses observed in minimal stimulation experiments using two-week-old animals  <cit>  see also  <cit> . whilst this effect tends to exaggerate changes in amplitude and success rate during dp in some neurons, it does not significantly interfere with estimates of potency or γ .

mechanisms underlying dpn
what might be the mechanism underlying dp that is not associated with a decrease in γ ? it is unlikely that this type of depression is due to a change in channel kinetics because there was no change in epsc kinetics . therefore the mechanism is most likely a reduction in the number of activated ampars. this could be due to a presynaptic mechanism such as a reduction in release probability, the l-glutamate content of vesicles or the amount of l-glutamate discharged during fusion. indeed there is evidence that some forms of ltd are expressed presynaptically  <cit> . postsynaptic mechanisms for a reduction in the number of activated ampa receptors include a reduction in their popen  <cit> or in the physical number of receptors present in the postsynaptic membrane  <cit> .

the present observations for dpn are indistinguishable from those that we and others have reported recently for de novo ltd  <cit> . for example, we showed that similar effects were obtained using the postsynaptic injection of a peptide  that disrupts the interaction between nsf and glur <dig>  <cit> . the effects of pep2m and those of de novo ltd were mutually occlusive, indicating a convergence of mechanisms. these data argue strongly for a postsynaptic mechanism of expression. furthermore, since pep2m causes the removal of ampa receptors from the membrane surface, as determined immunocytochemically  <cit> , it is most likely that de novo ltd is due to the physical elimination of synaptic ampa receptors. other evidence for a postsynaptic mechanism for de novo ltd includes a reduction in the postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate  <cit> , the dephosphorylation of serine  <dig> of the glur <dig> subunit  <cit>  and a rapid internalisation of ampa receptors  <cit>  associated with ltd. therefore, by analogy, we feel that the postsynaptic removal of ampa receptors is also the most likely explanation for dpn . accordingly, a reduction in ampa receptor number would account for the changes in potency without changes in success rate observed with modest dpn. the removal of an entire synaptic complement of ampa receptors would explain the additional change in success rate seen with large depressions associated with dpn in some cells.

mechanisms underlying dpγ
a number of possible underlying mechanisms could account for the change in γ during ltpγ and dpγ. non-sfa cannot distinguish between 1) a change from a single low conductance state to a single high conductance state, 2) changes in open times within a burst and, 3) changes in the proportion of time spent in different conductance states. since ampa receptors are known to have multiple conductance states  <cit>  we have postulated that the proportion of time spent in different conductance states is the modifiable parameter  <cit> . such a change is detectable with the type of analysis that we have used, which provides a weighted mean of the various sub-conductance states  <cit> . independent support for this hypothesis is provided by a study which shows that phosphorylation of glur <dig> at serine  <dig> increases the proportion of time ampa receptors spend in high conductance states, as determined by single channel recording  <cit> . indeed, phosphorylation of this residue occurs during ltp  <cit> . thus a possible mechanism of dpγ is the dephosphorylation of serine  <dig>  <cit> , perhaps involving calcineurin  <cit> , resulting in a lower proportion of time ampa receptors spend in the higher conductance states .

other theoretical possibilities exist to explain dpγ. for example, the silencing of synapses close to the patch electrode leaving more distant synapses contributing a lower net γ due to electrotonic filtering, or a decrease in trial-to-trial asynchrony of transmitter release. we believe that these possibilities are unlikely because in every cell in which de novo ltd was induced there was never a change in γ  <cit> . if such possibilities were likely, statistically one would expect similar changes to occur for both de novo ltd and dp. moreover, we have also investigated these possibilities using our standard compartmental model  <cit> . this shows that 1) the electrotonic filtering required to achieve an artefactual decrease in γ would have a pronounced effect on τdecay which was never observed experimentally, and 2) pronounced changes in asynchrony necessary to cause an artefactual change in γ cause large deviations from the parabolic relationship in the current-variance plot  and alterations in τrise  <cit> , also never observed experimentally. another possibility is that alterations in vesicle fusion pore dynamics leading to substantial changes in the peak and time-course of cleft glutamate are caused by synaptic plasticity  <cit> . such changes could differentially affect estimates of γ  <cit> , however they would be associated with substantial changes in τrise and τdecay  <cit> , which were never observed experimentally.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that there are two distinct molecular mechanisms for the reduction of synaptic strength. although previous studies have provided evidence that ltd is associated with dephosphorylation of serine  <dig> on glur <dig>  <cit>  and internalisation of ampa receptors  <cit>  it is not known whether this represents two separate mechanisms or two components of the same process. for example, dephosphorylation of glur <dig> could drive the internalisation of ampa receptors. here we show, for the first time, the co-existence of two distinct mechanisms for the expression of dp, using functional criteria under identical experimental conditions. the relationship between the two mechanisms is critically dependent upon the recent experience of the synapse, which may be governed by the phosphorylation state of the ampa receptor complement  <cit> . further work is now required to elucidate the relationship between these two fundamental mechanisms for modulating synaptic strength and the precise molecular mechanisms involved in each form of plasticity.
