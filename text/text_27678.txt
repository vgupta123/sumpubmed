BACKGROUND
monoterpenoid indole alkaloids  constitute a remarkable class of specialized metabolites, with a huge chemical diversity, and a source of several active compounds, including important pharmacophores. some of the most active anticancer drugs are based on this type of skeleton including camptothecans and vinca alkaloids. the later compounds are present in minute amounts in the leaves of the madagascar periwinkle, catharanthus roseus, and result from a complex metabolic pathway, which is the target of expanding research efforts in the phytochemical genomic era  <cit> .

mias stem from a unique polyvalent skeleton named strictosidine. this central precursor is the condensation product of a tryptophan-derived amine coupled to an extensively modified monoterpenoid moiety . while tryptamine is derived from tryptophan by a single reaction catalyzed by tryptophan decarboxylase   <cit> , the assembly of the monoterpene secoiridoid moiety, requires several reactions to convert the methyl-erythritol phosphate  pathway-derived monoterpenoid skeleton into secologanin   <cit> .fig.  <dig> the biosynthetic pathway of mia in c. roseus leaves. simplified representation of the mia biosynthesis in c. roseus highlighting the subcellular organization of the central steps of the pathway. known single enzymatic steps in each cell type are indicated by grey arrows and abbreviation of enzyme names. broken grey arrows and broken pink arrows indicate unknown enzymatic steps and metabolite translocation, respectively. dxs, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  synthase; dxr, dxp reductoisomerase; cms, 4--2c-methyl-d-erythritol  synthase; cmk, cm kinase; mecs, 2c-methyl-d-erythritol- <dig> -cyclodiphosphate  synthase; hds, hydroxymethylbutenyl 4-diphosphate  synthase; hdr, hd reductase; idi, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; gpps, geranyl diphosphate synthase; ges, geraniol synthase; g10h , geraniol 10-hydroxylase; cpr, cytochrome p450-reductase; 10hgo, 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase; io, iridoid oxidase; is, iridoid synthase; 7dlgt, 7-deoxyloganetic acid glucosyltransferase; 7dlh, 7-deoxyloganic acid 7-hydroxylase; lamt, loganic acid o-methyltransferase; sls , secologanin synthase; tdc, tryptophan decarboxylase; str, strictosidine synthase; sgd, strictosidine β-glucosidase; t16h <dig> , tabersonine 16-hydroxylase 2; 16omt, 16-hydroxytabersonine o-methyltransferase; nmt, 16-methoxy- <dig> -dihydrotabersonine n-methyltransferase; d4h, desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase; dat, deacetylvindoline 4-o-acetyltransferase. dmapp, dimethylallyl diphosphate; gap, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; ipp, isopentenyl diphosphate



recently, the elusive reaction scheme of secologanin biosynthesis has been elucidated in c. roseus. in the plastid-localized mep pathway, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  and pyruvate are converted into the universal isoprenoid precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate , through seven enzymatic reactions. the subsequent conversion of these primary metabolites into secologanin, by the monoterpene secoiridoid pathway, requires ten more enzymes.

first, the prenyl-transfer of ipp on dmapp by geranyl diphosphate synthase   <cit> , is followed by formation of the monoterpene geraniol by geraniol synthase   <cit>  . subsequently, geraniol is hydroxylated into the diol 10-hydroxygeraniol  and further oxidized into 10-oxogeraniol by the bifunctional p <dig> cyp76b <dig> named geraniol 10-hydroxylase . the third oxidation into the dialdehyde 10-oxogeranial requires a specific alcohol dehydrogenase, 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase . thereafter, iridoid synthase  performs the key step for the assembly of the iridoid heterocyclic ring structure. is uses 10-oxogeranial and probably couples an initial nad  h-dependent reduction with a subsequent cyclization step to form the ring structure of cis-trans-nepetelactol  <cit> . a second p <dig> enzyme cyp76a <dig>  7-deoxyloganetic acid synthase, also named iridoid oxidase , catalyzes a key 3-step oxidation of cis-trans-nepetelactol to form 7-deoxyloganetic acid  <cit> . the latter compound is linked to a glucosyl residue by a substrate specific udp-glucose glycosyltransferase , 7-deoxyloganetic acid glucosyltransferase   <cit> . the resulting product 7-deoxyloganic acid is hydroxylated at the c- <dig> position by 7-deoxyloganic acid 7-hydroxylase   <cit>  to yield loganic acid, which is methylated into loganin by a s-adenosyl-l-methionine: loganic acid methyl transferase   <cit> . finally, the ring-opening reaction of loganin in the biosynthesis of secologanin is catalyzed by the fourth p <dig> of this pathway, secologanin synthase   <cit> ).

following assembly of the monoterpenoid and indole precursors, formation of the mia basic skeleton is initiated by strictosidine synthase , which catalyzes the stereospecific condensation of tryptamine with secologanin to form 3α -strictosidine  <cit> . strictosidine β-d-glucosidase , catalyzing deglucosylation of strictosidine, produces the last common intermediate in the biosynthesis of the thousand existing mias, since the resulting aglycone is the starting point for many different skeletons  <cit> . the later conversion of the strictosidine aglycone into tabersonine has not been elucidated, but most steps in the final conversion of tabersonine into vindoline have been described. following 16-methoxylation of tabersonine, performed by the sequential action of tabersonine 16-hydroxylase   <cit>  and 16-hydroxytabersonine o-methyltransferase   <cit> , 16-methoxytabersonine undergoes an uncharacterized hydration reaction followed by n-methylation, hydroxylation and acetylation carried out by 16-methoxy- <dig> -dihydrotabersonine n-methyltransferase   <cit> , desacetoxyvindoline-4-hydroxylase   <cit>  and deacetylvindoline-4-o-acetyltransferase   <cit> , respectively.

the mia biosynthetic pathway displays one of the most complex and elaborated forms of compartmentalization described to date . it was shown to require the coordinated implication of at least four different cell types, implying specific intercellular translocations of metabolite whose identifications are underway. the biosynthesis of mias is initiated within internal phloem associated parenchyma  cells which host the initial steps leading to secologanin, i.e. the whole mep pathway together with the eight first reactions of monoterpene-secoiridoid pathway  <cit> . the central steps occur in leaf epidermis with conversion of loganic acid into secologanin, after its translocation from ipap cells. this latter is next conjugated to tryptamine to yield strictosidine, whose corresponding aglycone serves as the primary precursor for complex alkaloids  <cit> . following translocation of 16-methoxytabersonine or a downstream intermediate, vindoline biosynthesis is completed in laticifers and idioblast cells hosting d4h and dat activities  <cit> . in addition, all these biosynthetic steps are marked by a complex subcellular distribution pattern: soluble cytosolic enzymes , endoplasmic reticulum anchored enzymes , plastidial enzymes , vacuolar enzymes  and nuclear sgd  <cit> . however, despite the existence of multiple intra- and intercellular transports, only one transporter of the mia pathway has been characterized to date, tpt <dig>  that mediates the specific excretion of catharanthine at the leaf epidermis  <cit> .

recently, high throughput sequencing approaches  have been used to provide an access to full c. roseus transcriptomes and to help in identifying new genes of the mia biosynthetic pathway. such transcriptomes were released by three main initiatives, the medicinal plant genomics resource   <cit> , cathacyc and orcae  <cit>   and phytometasyn   <cit> , as well as other independent studies  <cit> . these data were generated from the sequencing of libraries prepared from whole-organs and specific experimental conditions. the resulting sequences have been used in orthology and gene clustering allowing the identification of new genes, such as 7dlh and 7dlgt . however, new results have pinpointed the involvement of multiple enzyme isoforms in this highly compartmentalized pathway of mia biosynthesis, adding thus an additional layer of complexity. indeed, we have recently described two isoforms of t16h , encoded by two distinct genes displaying different tissue-specific expression patterns  <cit> . however, it should be noted that the currently available c. roseus transcriptome resources failed to correctly integrate these isoforms, which could result from improper de novo assembly or insufficient sequencing depth of samples. hence, browsing the current c. roseus transcriptome resources might miss important information, highlighting the need for a more exhaustive transcriptome.

based on this ascertainment, the objective of the present study was to generate a consensus transcriptome containing an exhaustive library of c. roseus transcripts with expression level information. different strategies have been previously employed to generate transcriptome assemblies for non-model animal and plant species. most of them rely on the combination of assemblies resulting from different assemblers such as trinity  <cit> , oases  <cit> , transabyss  <cit>  and soapdenovo-trans  <cit>  with eventually different k-mer lengths since this criteria is expected to bypass the uneven distribution of transcript abundance  <cit> . such strategy was successfully conducted for anas platyrhynchos domestica  <cit>  and nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> , for which assemblies were performed on a unique library, but also for wheat, with assemblies performed on a mix of  <dig> libraries  <cit> . in each case, redundancy caused by the merging of different assemblies was decreased by using clustering tools such as cd-hit-est  <cit>  or tgicl  <cit> . in c. roseus, a recent study compared assemblies generated by abyss, velvet and oases running with different k-mer values on a mix of  <dig> libraries prepared from different organs and merged the best result with the previous assembly prepared by mpgr  <cit> . in such a case, mixing samples is expected to increase the possibility to find lowly expressed genes and isoforms, due to the diversity of reads sequenced from diverse tissues/experimental conditions, for instance. however, combining libraries prepared from different sources, such as plant cultivars, may also generate more potential isoforms due to genetic polymorphisms. in the present study, we built a new consensus transcriptome for c. roseus using already published data. we generated assemblies for every available sample to take advantage of the diversity of tissues/experimental conditions, combined them and tested different thresholds to cluster homologous contigs. special attention was taken to reduce the redundancy without affecting transcript quality. optimization of this consensus assembly was performed by monitoring reconstruction quality of all mia biosynthetic genes, with a particular emphasis on the two previously described t16h isoforms  <cit>  and on a newly identified sls isoform whose functional validation is also depicted. the reconstruction of such a c. roseus consensus transcriptome is expected to facilitate the identification of the missing mia biosynthetic enzymes by studying the clustering of gene expression for instance, but also the characterization of new isoforms whose existence could be predicted through this work.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of a second sls isoform
while amplifying the coding sequence of sls   <cit> , sequencing of the pcr products revealed the presence of a second putative isoform exhibiting 96 % identity with the original sls isoform. interrogation of the c. roseus transcriptomic databases  led to the identification of identical but partial sequences confirming thus the existence of this new sls sequence that has been recently deposited to genbank under accession number kf <dig>  the corresponding p <dig> also displayed a high level of identity  with the first sls isoform  suggesting that it could also catalyze the oxidative ring cleavage of loganin to produce secologanin. to test this hypothesis. the original and the new putative sls isoforms were individually expressed in the saccharomyces wat <dig> strain that overexpresses the arabidopsis nadph p <dig> reductase  <cit> . crude extracts of galactose-induced yeasts transformed with the pyedp <dig> empty control vector or the pyedp <dig> expressing each p <dig> were subsequently incubated with nadph, h+ and loganin, and analyzed by uplc-ms . while no modification of loganin occurred with the empty vector crude extract, a conversion of loganin into secologanin was observed with the crude extract of each enzyme. this established that the putative sls isoform truly corresponds to a new sls isoform, named sls <dig> as reference to cyp71a <dig>  renamed sls <dig> fig.  <dig> sls <dig> and sls <dig> catalyze the conversion of loganin in secologanin and secoxyloganin. a lc-ms chromatograms using selected ion monitoring  of the reaction products of yeast extracts from cell cultures expressing either sls <dig> or sls <dig> or containing the empty pyedp <dig> vector, incubated with loganin or secologanin. b schematic reaction catalyzed by sls <dig> and sls <dig> highlighting the aldehyde to acid conversion



interestingly, we noted that both sls <dig> and sls <dig> also convert loganin into a more polar compound identified as secoxyloganin according to uv and ms spectra and a comparison with a pure authentic standard . by contrast, this product was not produced using the empty vector crude extract suggesting that it results from a reaction catalyzed by sls. for sls <dig> and sls <dig>  time course reactions showed a decrease of the loganin content accompanied by the formation of both secologanin and secoxyloganin . since secoxyloganin corresponds to the acidic form of secologanin, it may result from the oxidation of the aldehyde function of secologanin. therefore, we tested the capacity of both sls <dig> and sls <dig> to convert secologanin into secoxyloganin. while no formation of secoxyloganin was monitored by incubating secologanin with the empty vector crude extract, both sls <dig> and sls <dig> directly produce secoxyloganin from secologanin in a stoichiometric manner at least during the early times of the reaction . as a consequence, these results suggest that sls <dig> and sls <dig> not only catalyze the oxidative ring cleavage of loganin to produce secologanin but also perform the oxidation of secologanin into secoxyloganin. besides g10h and io, sls <dig> and sls <dig> constitute the third type of p <dig> from the seco-iridoid pathway performing more than one catalytic reaction  <cit> . interestingly, the additional reaction catalyzed by sls <dig> and sls <dig> is similar to the third oxidation performed by io to generate 7-deoxyloganetic acid, suggesting that regiospecific multi-oxidation is rather common to p450s acting in secoiridoid biosynthesis. the occurrence of sequential oxidations has been reported for several p450s  <cit>  but the dissociation of intermediates is still a question of debate since it ranges from an absence of dissociation for p <dig> 11b <dig>  <cit>  to a dissociation of 85 % for p <dig> 2c <dig>  <cit> . in the absence of pulse-chase experiments, we are not able to propose a reaction scheme for both sls <dig> and sls <dig> concerning secologanin release.fig.  <dig> time course analyses of the reaction catalyzed by sls <dig> and sls <dig>  proteins extracts from yeast cells expressing either sls <dig> or sls <dig> were incubated at 30 °c with loganin or secologanin. formation of the resulting products was monitored by lc-ms analysis. black triangles, loganin; dark grey squares, secologanin; light circles, secoxyloganin



while important amounts of secologanin can be measured in the different organs of c. roseus  <cit>  we never detected the presence of secoxyloganin , raising the question of the physiological signification of this compound production but also suggesting that secologanin could be release from the sls catalytic site during the sequential oxidation process. secoxyloganin is an acidic compound derived from secologanin that is no longer able to be condensed with tryptamine by str in the vacuole, due to the absence of the aldehyde function. if secoxyloganin formation occurs in vivo, the resulting depletion of the secologanin pool would be deleterious for the subsequent synthesis of mias. although we cannot exclude that additional enzymes might convert secoxyloganin back to secologanin, the subcellular compartmentation of secologanin biosynthesis may also limit secoxyloganin formation in planta. subcellular localization studies showed that sls <dig> is located to the endoplasmic reticulum as previously observed for sls <dig>  <cit>  . since both sls <dig> and sls <dig> are anchored to this subcellular compartment and release their product in the cytosol, active transport of secologanin to the vacuolar compartment with high efficiency might allow its import before additional oxidation by sls <dig> or sls <dig>  this would be a direct and interesting consequence of the complex subcellular organization of the mia biosynthetic pathway regarding regulation of the metabolic flux.fig.  <dig> sls <dig> is located to the endoplasmic reticulum. c. roseus cells were transiently transformed with the sls2-yfp-expressing vector  in combination with the plasmid expressing an er-cfp marker . colocalization of the two fluorescence signals appears on the merged images . cell morphology  was observed with differential interference contrast . bars = 10 μm



besides t16h and is, sls corresponds to the third type of enzymes from the mia biosynthetic pathway displaying more than one isoform  <cit> . while t16h <dig> and t16h <dig> have distinct organ specific-roles in mia biosynthesis, is <dig> and is <dig> display somewhat redundant functions. to gain insight into the respective involvement of the two sls isoforms, sls <dig> and sls <dig> gene expression was measured in the main c. roseus organs . sls <dig> expression was detected in all the tested organs and reached maxima in those directly associated with mia biosynthesis including roots, flower buds and leaves. by contrast, sls <dig> transcripts were barely detectable in all organs except in roots where expression was three-fold lower than sls <dig>  it is interesting to note that sls <dig> was initially characterized from a cell suspension culture cdna library  <cit> . therefore, these results suggest that sls <dig> and sls <dig> can contribute concomitantly to secologanin biosynthesis in roots while sls <dig> can be the prominent isoform of secologanin biosynthesis in the aerial parts of the plant.fig.  <dig> expression of sls <dig> and sls <dig> in c. roseus organs. sls <dig>  and sls <dig>  transcript levels were determined by real-time rt-pcr analyses performed on total rna extracted from c. roseus organs and transcript copy numbers were normalized using crrps <dig>  r, roots; s, stems; yl, young leaves; ml, mature leaves; fb, flower buds; fl, flowers; fr, fruits



reconstruction of individual mia genes in current assemblies and new single assemblies generated with trinity
our functional approach clearly demonstrates the existence of mia enzyme isoforms potentially displaying specific catalytic parameters and/or expression patterns. the identification of new enzyme isoforms is of importance and may notably help in isolating the most efficient enzymes that could be used in synthetic biology approaches as recently highlighted for strictosidine production  <cit> . rna-seq data for c. roseus provide an important opportunity to retrieve such isoforms by analyzing sequences sharing high identities. in addition, combining gene expression levels from different experimental conditions will improve the quality of transcript expression patterns which allow conducting gene clustering analyses. however, this requires a correct reconstruction of each isoform.

we performed a detailed inspection of the current transcriptomic resources, available from medicinal plant genomic resources  <cit> , phytometasyn  <cit>  , cathacyc/orcae  <cit>  and a newly prepared transcriptome by a nipgr research team  <cit> . the corresponding datasets will be thereafter named mpgrcra, pmsillu , pms <dig> , ccorcae and nipgr, respectively . our analysis revealed that correct reconstruction of mia genes was not systematic. reference sequences of mia genes available on ncbi were blasted against those assemblies and the bitscore of best hit was compared to that of an ideal reconstruction, i.e. the bitscore of the reference sequence against itself. on the whole, quality of reconstruction was quite unequal between assemblies . pms <dig> and ccorcae assemblies displayed the best sequences while pmsillu was of weaker quality . nipgr and mpgrcra assemblies were quite similar in content, probably due to the construction design of the nipgr assembly . classically, discrepancies between assemblies might be due to natural polymorphisms, sequencing and/or reconstruction errors. when looking at very well reconstructed genes such as 7dlh and lamt, it appeared that small differences are related to single-base variations. for 7dlh, such a variation was observed at the position  <dig> of the reference sequence  in the two assemblies mprgcra and nipgr where a c was changed to a. this variation could be a true snp  as the reference sequence was obtained with another cultivar . concerning isoforms of t16h  and sls , it appeared that current assemblies failed to present high quality sequences of the  <dig> transcripts  simultaneously. for example, while both sls isoforms were well reconstructed  in pms <dig>  it was not the case for t16h <dig> . the best reconstructions of t16h <dig> and t16h <dig> were found in mpgrcra  and nipgr , respectively. this result prompted us to try new assembly strategies in order to produce a more complete transcriptome.fig.  <dig> reconstruction quality of mia genes in different assemblies. current resources , b = mpgrcra , c = nipgr, d = pms <dig> , e = pmsillu  and new assemblies  were used as databases to identify homologs of mia genes, and the resulting bitscore obtained by blast was compared to that of an ideal sequence 



to this aim, we next compared new single assemblies of each sample prepared with the trinity pipeline  <cit> , since the resulting diversity is expected to reveal more mia biosynthetic genes and isoforms. for this approach, a total of  <dig> samples were retained because of their paired-end sequencing design as it is expected to improve the quality of reconstruction . before running trinity, read content in each sample was normalized by analyzing k-mer content  to remove reads being overrepresented or displaying abnormal distribution and their quality was assessed with fastqc . again, a wide range of reconstruction quality was observed. all mia biosynthetic genes had a high reconstruction quality  in at least one single assembly. however, as observed for current resources, we did not observe the simultaneous presence of sls and t16h isoforms, despite the use of mixed libraries . interestingly, the base variation within 7dlh described above was no more observable in the alignment of best hits  in each single assembly with the 7dlh reference sequence. hence the variations observed in nipgr and mpgrcra assemblies probably result from reconstruction errors.

preparation of a consensus transcriptome for c. roseus
the quality of reconstruction of mia biosynthetic genes in single assemblies suggests that raw resources might contain enough information to construct a consensus transcriptome since most of genes displayed a good reconstruction  in at least one sample . because samples were sequenced at different depth, it may be possible that partial transcripts were also reconstructed in single assemblies. therefore, two strategies based on the combination of samples were then tested to correctly assemble isoforms and mia biosynthetic genes : we first tried to combine all reads and generate a new assembly, while, in the second approach, the individual transcriptomes were combined and the resulting dataset clustered  and subsequently filtered .fig.  <dig> preparation of a consensus transcriptome using previously published rna-seq data. single transcriptomes were de novo assembled with trinity using samples with paired-end design, then combined and similar contigs were subsequently clustered with cd-hit-est. poor quality clusters were removed on the basis of cluster length, composition and expression . for trying purposes, we also constructed with trinity a transcriptome on a dataset including reads from all samples with paired-end design



in the first approach, reads from each paired-end samples were normalized , combined and the resulting read set was normalized again. the resulting transcriptome contained  <dig>  transcripts with a n <dig> value of  <dig>  nt . this important number of transcripts suggested the presence of fragmented transcripts and cd-hit-est was employed with increasing thresholds of sequence identity . however, neither this transcriptome nor its corresponding clustered subsets contained high quality sequences .

in the second approach, we merged all single trinity assemblies  and ran different filtering procedures in order to decrease the resulting redundancy without altering transcript quality. a total of  <dig> , <dig> contigs from single assemblies were then combined. this allowed combining very high quality transcripts within one new assembly which however, contained an evident redundancy due to the merging procedure. indeed, the resulting large dataset is expected to cover a large number of isoforms. these isoforms may be real transcripts such as isoforms of sls and t16h that have to be differentiated, or alleles of different cultivars, which should be integrated into a reference sequence. running cd-hit-est with different sequence identity thresholds succeeded in combining contigs into clusters . this algorithm clusters similar sequences and uses one of them as a representative one. a weak decrease in sequence quality was observed with lower identity thresholds for 16omt , is and sls <dig> for clustering thresholds lower than  <dig>  . the transcript with lowest quality was t16h <dig> . however, its quality was quite similar with that of the best reconstruction in current resources . two other genes, idi <dig> and str did not display ideal reconstruction, according to the reference sequence. idi <dig> was slightly better reconstructed in pms <dig> and str was better in nipgr and pms <dig>  the origin of those discrepancies are unclear but might have been caused by a higher polymorphism, leading to a different reference sequence in comparison to the representative clusters obtained here. according to the quality of mia biosynthetic gene reconstruction, we further retained the clustered dataset obtained with a sequence identity threshold of 97 %. this threshold should be permissive enough to combine alleles differing by only few snps. the resulting clustered dataset, thereafter renamed cd <dig>  was composed of a total of  <dig>  clusters,  <dig>  being singletons  and  <dig>  being real clusters, containing more than two contigs . a total of  <dig>  sequences had identities  with sequences of the uniprot database , and  <dig>  proteins found in this database were represented at 90 % of their length by at least one cluster in cd <dig> fig.  <dig> clustering of redundant contigs in the dataset resulting from the combination of all single assemblies. contigs sharing a given % of identity were clustered with cd-hit-est. a number of clusters after cd-hit-est at % identity thresholds fixed from  <dig> to 100 %. b reconstruction quality of mia genes in the current resources  and the datasets resulting from the clustering by cd-hit-est at % identity thresholds. reference mia gene sequences were blasted against each assembly and the resulting bitscore was compared to that of an ideal sequence 



participation of initial single assemblies in cd <dig> clusters was homogeneous, except for srr <dig> for which only 10 % of contigs  were used by cd-hit-est. concerning srr <dig> single assembly, the low proportion of reads used in cd <dig> was probably due to its very high number of contigs  in comparison with the other assemblies. for other single assemblies, more than 90 % of contigs were used by cd-hit-est, with at least 50 % in true clusters . composition of true clusters revealed a somewhat preferential association of contigs from single assemblies obtained in a same study . correlation coefficients calculated on the pattern of participation of each single assembly in true clusters were higher for  <dig> groups of samples:  srr <dig> and srr <dig> ,  srr <dig>  srr <dig> and srr <dig> ,  srr <dig> and srr <dig>  and  srr <dig>  srr <dig>  srr <dig> and srr <dig> . this preferential association is more likely to be due to the inherent genetic diversity between c. roseus cultivars than experimental conditions. however, high coefficient correlations  were also observed for independent studies, as exemplified between srr <dig> and srr <dig>  the strongest differences were observed for samples of the nipgr study  and for srr <dig>  for the latter, this might be linked to its higher participation in singletons than in true clusters . in cd <dig>   <dig>  clusters contained contigs from  <dig> to  <dig> different single assemblies,  <dig>  clusters contained contigs from more than  <dig> single assemblies and  <dig>  clusters were composed of contigs from the  <dig> single assemblies . these  <dig>  clusters might represent the core transcriptome of c. roseus. indeed,  <dig>  had significant  identities with proteins of the uniprotkb database  .fig.  <dig> composition of the clustered dataset  resulting from the processing of the combination of all single assemblies with cd-hit-est at 97 % identity. a integration of contigs from single assemblies into clusters. contigs which cannot be grouped with others are called singletons. true clusters, i.e. containing at least two different contigs, may have been formed by the combination of contigs from one or more initial single assemblies. b correlation plot of single assemblies. contigs found in each cluster  were identified and counted per initial assembly. two initial assemblies are therefore strongly correlated  if their contigs are found in the same clusters. c composition of true clusters. this graph shows how many single assemblies are represented within clusters

to further clean cd <dig>  all putative clusters were tested for  <dig> criteria:  length,  number of contigs and  expression level  calculated on the  <dig> samples . visual inspection of the number of clusters potentially removed by each filter  was used to choose appropriate values. the objective was to eliminate clusters with poor representation which could be reconstruction artefacts. choosing low thresholds of number of contigs and fpkm quickly removed a high number of clusters . for these two filters, we choose to retain values at which changes in the number of removed clusters displayed lower variation: <dig> contigs per cluster and sum of fpkm > <dig>  concerning cluster length, the distribution was more graduated . in order to avoid removing weakly expressed or small genes, we chose to discard clusters that do not meet at least two of the three filters . we expected that this procedure could reduce the loss of weakly expressed genes or rare isoforms. by fixing a minimal length of 500 bp, a number of contigs >  <dig> and a sum of fpkm >  <dig>  we found that a large number of sequences  did not pass the three filters. this indicated that many clusters which size was < 500 bp have both poor representation and weak expression levels. we also found  <dig>  clusters which had a sum of fpkm <  <dig> and contained less than  <dig> contigs. all sequences having a null sum of fpkm fell in this class. out of the  <dig>  clusters of cd <dig>  a total of  <dig>  sequences did not pass the filters. the resulting dataset, which contained  <dig>  clusters, was retained and called cdf <dig> fig.  <dig> characterization of clusters in the clustered dataset . these graphs represent the number of clusters falling below different threshold values for the number of contigs , the summed fpkm   and cluster length . red bars show the thresholds that were retained to filter poorly supported sequences from cd <dig>  sequences which met at least two of those criteria were discarded  



out of these  <dig>  clusters in cdf <dig>   <dig>  sequences had a significant  identity within the uniprotkb database  . our filtering process obviously decreased the number of potentially annotated proteins , and to a lower extent the number of full-length proteins in uniprot represented by more 90 % of their length . however, given the large number of clusters that were removed, we considered that this loss was limited. very rare isoforms may have been discarded in cdf <dig> by the filtering procedure but only if they had weak single assembly representation and low expression level. in addition, the number of full-length proteins in cdf <dig> was still higher than in the previously published datasets . looking for such isoforms will therefore require a more detailed examination of cd <dig> . the total number of clusters in cdf <dig> was higher than other assemblies  but similar to that of  <dig>  in nipgr and lower than that of mpgrcra . therefore, it is likely that all redundancy has not been removed in cdf <dig>  as a consequence, detailed inspection of expression levels together with functional studies will be required to further clean cdf <dig> 

validation of the consensus fpkm-filtered-cdhit- <dig> transcriptome through transcript abundance estimation
the gene expression levels of sls and t16h isoforms were determined by qpcr and compared to fpkm values calculated according to the rsem procedure for each transcript within each assembly. as each isoform has apparent specific expression patterns , the correct alignment of reads to high quality sequences should be able to yield similar results.fig.  <dig> cdf <dig> performance in quality reconstruction and transcript expression level. a current resources , cd <dig> and cdf <dig> were used as databases to identify homologs of mia genes, and the resulting bitscore obtained by blast was compared to that of an ideal sequence . values inside each cell indicate the number of hits having a ratio > <dig> . b comparison of log <dig> expression levels measured by qpcr and rna-seq for sls and t16h isoforms in current assemblies, cd <dig> and cdf <dig>  rna-seq samples used for this comparison were: flowers , mature leaves , roots  and young leaves . expression levels were normalized by rps <dig>  in both qpcr and rna-seq measurements. the linear regression line is shown in blue with shading corresponding to  <dig> % confidence intervals. the r² values indicate correlation coefficients of the linear models



more than  <dig>  billion reads from the  <dig> c. roseus samples were mapped back with bowtie <dig>  <cit>  to current assemblies, as well as our datasets cd <dig> and cdf <dig>  substantial differences were observed in the total number of correctly aligned reads between assemblies:  <dig>  % on ccorcae,  <dig>  % on mpgrcra,  <dig>  % on nipgr,  <dig>  % on pms <dig>   <dig>  % on pmsillu,  <dig>  % on cd <dig> and  <dig>  % on cdf <dig>  to estimate abundance of clusters in cd <dig> and cdf <dig>  a contig to cluster map was prepared, similarly to the procedure used in rsem relying on a transcript to gene map. this was expected to ensure a correct estimation of expression, in particular for rare isoforms  displaying slight sequence difference from the cluster representative sequence. best hits for sls and t16h isoforms were selected within each assembly. sls <dig>  sls <dig>  t16h <dig> and t16h <dig> sequences were respectively: caros <dig>  caros <dig>  caros <dig> and caros <dig> in ccorcae; cra_locus_10318_iso_2_len_357_ver_ <dig>  cra_locus_1389_iso_1_len_312_ver_ <dig>  cra_locus_6184_iso_8_len_1687_ver_ <dig> and cra_locus_6184_iso_10_len_1687_ver_ <dig> in mpgrcra; cr_tc <dig> , cr_tc <dig> and cr_tc <dig> in nipgr; crowl1vd_rep_c <dig>  crowl1vd_rep_c <dig>  crowl1vd_rep_c <dig>  in pms454; cro. cro1l1vd_velvet--contig <dig>  and cro. cro1l1vd_velvet--contig <dig>  in pmsillu; srr648707|tr19558|c0_g2_i <dig>  srr646572|tr30446|c0_g1_i <dig>  srr648707|tr1325|c0_g1_i <dig> and srr1271857|tr29335|c0_g2_i <dig> in cd97; srr648707|tr19558|c0_g2_i <dig>  srr646572|tr30446|c0_g1_i <dig>  srr648707|tr1325|c0_g1_i <dig> and srr342019|tr37243|c0_g2_i <dig> in cdf <dig>  interestingly, the best hit for t16h <dig> differed between cd <dig> and cdf <dig>  this indicated that the best form in cd <dig> was either not sufficiently expressed or not represented in the single assemblies to be conserved in cdf <dig>  hence in cdf <dig>  a slightly less similar sequence for t16h <dig> was retained albeit being better represented in reads and assemblies . expression levels were calculated as fpkm and normalized to the best hit of c. roseus rps <dig> gene sequence .

the expression of each isoform was monitored in immature leaves, mature leaves, flowers and roots. despites the use of different matrices for fpkm and qpcr analyses, interesting results were observed by comparing both types of measurement. using current assemblies, we found that expression levels measured on mpgrcra displayed the best correlation with qpcr measurements . for this assembly, t16h <dig> expression was mixed with that of t16h <dig> since fpkm indicated similar expressions in flower and immature leaves, while we previously showed by qpcr that t16h <dig> accumulated in flowers but not t16h <dig>  <cit> . the highest correlation was observed for cdf <dig> . the contig-to-cluster map used for cd <dig> and cdf <dig>  apparently allowed a more precise calculation of cluster expression values. the higher correlation coefficient obtained with cd <dig> and cdf <dig> were probably due to this procedure which was expected to encompass slight polymorphisms that would have impeded read alignment on representative sequences of clusters. because both the contig and representative sequence  belong to the same cluster, expression levels are calculated for each contig and subsequently attributed to the representative sequence. contigs specifically expressed in one given sample, having punctuate sequence variation  are thereby used to estimate the expression level of the representative sequence in this sample. taken together, these results are good indicators of the validity of our cdf97dataset, in both sequence reconstruction and expression levels.

exploitation of cdf <dig> transcriptome for prediction of other mia biosynthetic gene isoforms
our finding that gene isoforms may encode similar enzymes  potentially add another layer of complexity to the mia biosynthetic pathway. to predict putative new isoforms, we therefore looked at the number of hits having a score ratio >  <dig>  within each assembly. this threshold was empirically determined as lower enough to reveal potential isoforms. according to fig. 11a, sls isoforms are identified in pms <dig>  cd <dig> and cdf <dig>  as indicated by the presence of more than  <dig> hit for the corresponding gene. similarly, isoforms of t16h are observable in nipgr, cd <dig> and cdf <dig>  it also appeared that our dataset cdf <dig> still displayed redundancy among sequences as the number of hits for some genes was still important . rather than being true isoforms, it is probable that our clustering and filtering procedures were not stringent enough to remove all redundant sequences. however, in our approach, a special attention was given to avoid discarding rare isoforms. therefore, genes having  <dig> or  <dig> hits with a score ratio >  <dig>   would merit further studies to determine whether they correspond to true isoforms  or only simple alleles of different cultivars. for instance, two similar sequences were predicted for is in cdf <dig>  which correspond to the recently reported is homologs in c. roseus  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
besides t16h and is, the identification of a second sls isoform shade light anew on the existence of multiple isoforms of mia biosynthetic enzymes in c. roseus. apart from the complex cellular and subcellular organisation of the mia pathway, such a potential enzyme multiplicity constitutes another element implemented along evolution to ensure an efficient and modular production of mia. it also raises interesting questions regarding the regulation of the mia metabolic fluxes as suggested by the capacity of both sls <dig> and sls <dig> to produce secologanin and secoxyloganin, but also regarding evolution of p450s from the seco-iridoid pathway that catalyze more than one reaction.

all these questions strengthened the necessity to develop new tools facilitating the identification of mia biosynthetic enzymes as well as their potential isoforms. our reconstructed assembly constitutes thus one of the most optimized transcriptomic resources for c. roseus that will facilitate future identification of homologs in the mia biosynthetic pathway enzymes as well the discovery of uncharacterized enzymes through analyses of gene expression correlation as recently described  <cit>  and demonstrated  <cit> . this resource opens new perspectives toward the understanding of the whole mia biosynthetic pathway and remains complementary to genomic sequence analysis.
