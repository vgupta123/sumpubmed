BACKGROUND
species diversification and morphological evolution are not always correlated, as demonstrated by the existence of hidden genetic diversity in taxa previously considered as single species. in sexual organisms, a cryptic species complex in the sense of  <cit>  designates reproductively isolated species assigned to the same taxonomical species name because they are hardly distinguishable morphologically: sibling taxa with obscure morphologies  <cit> . the concept is not new: in  <dig>  ernest mayr listed several known ‘sibling species’ in support to his criticisms of the morphological species concept. but the prevalence of hidden diversity in various taxa has been much better appreciated in the two last decades owing to surveys of dna variation within species or closely related species  <cit> . the abundance of cryptic species raises several issues. estimating the number of species has become a challenge  <cit> . the use of confounding cryptic species as biological indicators or for medicinal applications can be detrimental if the cryptic species in question differ from their common allied species members in terms of their ecology or physiology. conservation issues need to be considered for economically important species, such as timber tree species which are sometimes composed of complexes of cryptic species  <cit> .

hidden genetic diversity can sometimes be detected through direct observations, suggesting for instance reproductive barrier between individuals . reproductive isolation between sympatric sibling species can be detected using genetic markers. in addition, several molecular markers are needed because different evolutionary processes such as incomplete lineage sorting can obscure the genetic divergence displayed by a single marker. dna-based phylogenetic approaches are often used to delineate species, and reproductively isolated groups can be identified following the phylogenetic species concept if they segregate into different monophyletic lineages. however, the absence of monophyly is not conclusive because genetically isolated groups can be paraphyletic or polyphyletic  <cit> . hence, in order to delineate closely related species, methods that do not require monophyly would be suitable.

a variety of such methods have been proposed  <cit> . flot et al.  <cit>  suggested the construction of haplowebs of nuclear sequences to identify fields for recombination , a ffr being a group of individuals that have haplotypes found co-occurring in heterozygotes. for this reason, the approach is not applicable on plastid or mitochondrial sequences. the ffr approach does not require monophyly and it was demonstrated that this method is among the best single-locus methods for delimitating species especially in species-poor data sets  <cit> . this performance is explained by the fact that construction of ffr relies on the verification of contemporaneous gene flow among the putative species, because gene flow is a crucial issue when one deals with species delimitation following the “biological species concept”. biparentally inherited molecular markers have been widely used to estimate gene flow and to construct species phylogeny  for most plant species  <cit> .

besides nuclear dna sequences, widely used co-dominant markers such as nuclear microsatellites  and single-nucleotide polymorphism loci  are valuable to address population structure and species delineation in closely related taxa  <cit> . assignment of genetic clusters to different species is automatic when the detected groups are found in sympatry and there is absence or scarcity of gene flow that cannot be explained by history , ecological factors  or particular breeding systems . guichoux et al.  <cit>  suggested that microsatellites may be better than snp to detect mixtures of genetic clusters . this ratio is not a rule but should depend on the characteristics of the loci used, the number of alleles, the degree of differentiation among the studied populations, and the methods used for marker development, which can at times generate ascertainment bias  <cit> .


milicia is an important african timber genus that has received attention from scientists during the last decade, although the focus was on populations found in ghana and cameroon . phylogeographical and phylogenetical investigations by  <cit>  confirmed the existence of two morphologically similar species: m. regia, found west africa from senegal to ghana, and m. excelsa, found from west to east africa and part of austral africa. several lines of evidence suggest that our current phylogeographic knowledge might be incomplete. first, relying on morphological characterization, the renowned botanist auguste chevalier claimed that m. regia naturally occurs in some parts of gabon  <cit> . second, east africa was poorly represented in  <cit>  while it might harbour genetically original populations, as reported in other widely distributed african plant species . third, the heterogeneous sampling intensity of the previous works might have affected the power to detect distinct genetic clusters  <cit>  so that a more systematic sampling may reveal additional patterns. in addition, the degree of similarity or overlap of the environmental envelopes of the inferred genetic clusters as well as the degree of correlation between genetic distances and niche overlap measures have seldom been addressed in african plant taxa, although these issues may give hints on the relative importance of neutral vs. adaptive forces underlying genetic differentiation between clusters  <cit> .

the present study revisits the genetic diversity of milicia populations in africa along with an assessment of its relationships with climate niche patterns using a more homogeneous sampling. we compare the ability of ssrs and snps for delimiting genetic clusters and species, and detect any hidden genetic diversity in milicia populations, and we use a nuclear dna sequence to assess phylogenetic relationships. more specifically, we addressed the following questions:  does milicia regia naturally occur in central africa as reported a century ago  <cit> , and if so, what is the degree of divergence between the populations of the genus milicia in central and east africa?  what is the degree of congruence between the different genetic markers in terms of population structure and history?  is there any sign indicating that habitat selection may have contributed to the genetic divergence among milicia genetic clusters?

methods
study taxa, sampling context and sampling plan
the genus milicia contains two species in sympatry in west africa: m. regia and m. excelsa. whereas the range of m. regia seems to be restricted to the upper guinean domain, m. excelsa stretches in various african forest types from west to east africa. both species are wind pollinated and seeds are dispersed by bats and parrots  <cit> . genetic evidence showed that they constitute two reproductively isolated groups despite existence of paraphyly in m. excelsa  <cit> . in west africa, m. regia is considered as an endangered species due to overexploitation for timber production and deforestation, and is listed as a vulnerable species by the iucn  <cit> . there is no particular logging restriction regarding the widespread m. excelsa in central africa, except for a minimum cutting diameter.

a project dedicated to wood traceability purposes has been recently achieved ;  <cit> ). one of its specific objectives was to document the genetic structuring in milicia species at a higher spatial resolution than previous works that detected five geographically coherent genetic clusters  <cit> ). to this end, a systematic sampling was carried out in seven countries: ivory coast, ghana, cameroon, gabon, republic of the congo, democratic republic of the congo and kenya, with 10- <dig> individuals sampled in grid-cells of 100- <dig> km side  laid out on the known range of the genus. for the present study we retained a subsample of  <dig> individuals distributed over the study zone  which represented a substantial part of the range of the genus.fig.  <dig> evolution of genetic clustering among  <dig> milicia samples according to k

genotyping and sequencing
these  <dig> individuals were genotyped at seven nuclear microsatellites following  <cit>  and at  <dig> biallelic nuclear snp loci. these snp markers were developed using an approach of the thünen institute for forest genetics . the method is based on a restriction associated dna sequencing protocol . two samples of m. excelsa from benin and kenya were used. libraries were prepared using the restriction enzyme sbfi, and sequenced on the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform to create paired end reads of  <dig> x  <dig> bp. snps were identified in the sequenced individuals using variant call format   <dig>  . marker screening was conducted in a sample comprising  <dig> individuals of m. excelsa and  <dig> individuals of m. regia in assay design suite   and genotyped on the massarray iplex platform  . the same team of the tifg contributed to the development of similar snp markers in another african tree species in the framework of the aforementioned project and the protocol is described in  <cit> . snps have been chosen because they can be assayed using shorter dna fragments than microsatellites, an advantage using degraded dna extracted from wood. in a subset of  <dig> individuals, we further sequenced two intergenic regions of the plastid genome, psba-trnh and trnc-ycf <dig>  and one genic region of the nuclear genome, at <dig>  the only polymorphic region observed among  <dig> tested gene regions in milicia  <cit> . the protocol for sequencing is described in  <cit> .

genetic structure of milicia populations and morphological differentiation of genetic clusters
we ran tess  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to identify genetic clusters separately using the snps and ssrs datasets. the protocol was as follows: the maximum number of clusters, k
max, was fixed between  <dig> and 10; we chose an admixture model and the interaction parameter, ψ, was set to  <dig> ; each run consisted in  <dig>  iterations with a  <dig> burn-in period, and we performed  <dig> runs for each value of k
max. then for each type of markers, we plotted values of the deviance information criterion, dic, against k
max to infer the likely number of clusters. the average cluster membership, q, of each individual was finally determined  and individuals were assigned to a given cluster when q >  <dig> . because both snp and ssr loci detected a questionable genetic cluster of scattered but well delimited populations into the central african region with genetic affinities with m. regia, the latter being expected only in west africa , we also verified the leaf morphology of samples from each genetic cluster under a stereomicroscope. the lower leaf surface of adult specimens of m. excelsa should present microscopic hairs in contrast to m. regia  <cit> .

for each inferred genetic cluster, the following diversity parameters were computed using spagedi  <dig>   <cit> : the effective number of alleles, nae  <cit> , the allelic richness, ar , and the gene diversity corrected for sample size, he. the degree of differentiation between genetic clusters was assessed through three parameters: f
st and nei’s standard genetic distance with sample size correction, d
s, which are both allele identity based statistics, and 
 <dig> based on microsatellite allele size   <cit> . d
s and 
 <dig> are expected to better reflect divergence time than f
st, which depends much on genetic drift, and can be used for phylogenetic reconstruction.

phylogeny and estimate of divergence time among genetic clusters
microsatellites can be useful in phylogenetic reconstruction under the stepwise mutation model and mutation-drift balance  even for taxa that have diverged as long as  <dig> mya  <cit> . therefore, we verified whether the ssrs-based phylogeny of genetic clusters could confirm the phylogenies inferred from dna sequences . using poptree  <dig> and following  <cit> , we constructed phylogenetic trees based on d
s and 
 <dig> computed from the ssrs data. trees were constructed with the neighbor-joining method and tree validity was evaluated by bootstrapping . we also estimated divergence time t between pairs of genetic clusters via the equation 
2 = 2μg  <cit> , with μ being the mutation rate per locus per generation and g the number of generations after the divergence of the two considered populations. we assumed  <dig> years per generation and μ ranging between  <dig>  x 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> per generation per locus for microsatellite loci  <cit> .

for nucleotide sequence data, we first constructed a median joining network for each sequence using network  <dig>   <cit> . thereafter only the nuclear sequence at <dig> was employed for further analyses as plastid sequence data provided poor separation of the different genetic clusters . haplotypes were reconstructed with phase implemented in dnasp  <cit>  and champuru  <cit>  for length variant heterozygotes. a haploweb sensu  <cit>  was constructed by connecting haplotypes occurring in heterozygous individuals in order to identify fields for recombination . to verify congruence between ssrs data and those of the nuclear sequence at <dig>  we also constructed a phylogenetic tree based on at <dig> haplotypes through the bayesian method implemented in *beast  <cit> . from a previous analysis in  <cit> , we dated the ancestor of milicia at 8- <dig> mya  and this was utilized as a prior for the analysis. a yule tree prior and an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock were assumed. the mcmc was run seven times for  <dig> million generations, each run being sampled every  <dig>  generations, and the final tree had the highest posterior probabilities at the nodes.

modelling the environmental niche of genetic clusters and evaluating correlation between niche overlap and genetic distance
first, we inferred putative geographical locations of each genetic cluster detected with tess  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  through environmental niche modelling using maxent  <cit>  with the logistic methods and the default settings for the maximum entropy. last glacial maximum  climatic variables obtained at  <dig>  arc-minute resolution from the worldclim global dataset  <cit>  were considered for niche modelling. principal component analysis  was used as a data reduction technique to avoid model over-fitting linked to correlated predictor variables  <cit> . we retained a  <dig> km-buffer zone to the whole dataset in order to reach the known limits of milicia range in africa and because this gave the best models based on preliminary values of the area under the curve . analyses were performed with the r environment  <cit> .

second, we applied a smoothing technique through a pca that divides the environmental space  in cells and uses a kernel function to determine the smoothed density of occurrence for each genetic cluster to each cell i   <cit> . then we computed the metric d developed by  <cit>  for pairwise niche overlap  for genetic clusters x and y, respectively, to cell i). the statistic d varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> . finally, the correlation between genetic distances as expressed by d
s or 
 <dig> from ssrs and niche overlap measure d, was tested by the means of a simple mantel test in order to verify whether niche overlap was higher – or not – in genetically similar clusters. recent studies revealed that genetic divergence of specific gene markers can be a good predictor of differentiation at quantitative trait loci in random mating populations  <cit> . that is, divergence in neutral loci can reflect adaptive phenotypic selection . hence any significant correlation between d and d
s or 
 <dig> may reflect a genetic signature of divergent selection across some genetic clusters of milicia, especially those in the congo basin where climate is quite similar across a large region. we chose genetic divergence measures from ssrs because they are superior at elucidating the genetic structure of milicia populations . a total of  <dig>  permutations were performed for testing the significance of the mantel tests.

RESULTS
genetic clustering from ssrs vs snps: evidence of a closely related taxon of m. regia in central africa
when applying genetic clustering using the snp dataset the increment of the likelihood of the data with k
max displayed a steep positive slope to k
max =  <dig> followed by a shallower positive slope with k
max without an asymptotic trend . using the ssr dataset the substantial increase of likelihood occurs up to k
max =  <dig> where an asymptote seems to be reached . the clustering patterns defined geographically coherent genetic clusters  and were globally congruent between snps and ssrs, except that the order at which the genetic clusters appeared as k
max increased differed between types of markers . snps and ssrs clustering patterns were globally congruent when k
max =  <dig> for snps  and k
max =  <dig> for ssrs . the main difference is that one of the snps genetic clusters was divided into two clusters according to ssrs: one in west africa, k <dig>  and another one in central africa, k <dig> 

the west african individuals of m. regia formed one genetic cluster named k <dig>  west african individuals of m. excelsa formed another cluster named k <dig>  both types of markers also identified a large genetic cluster of m. excelsa, k <dig>  stretching from the forest zone of cameroon to the northern parts of the republic of the congo  and democratic republic of the congo . a genetic cluster k <dig> covered the western part of gabon and appeared only at k
max =  <dig> for the snps and k
max =  <dig> for the ssrs . a fifth genetic cluster, k <dig>  covered kenya . the main difference between the two types of markers was the finding of  <dig> central african individuals that were assigned to cluster k <dig>  according to snps  whereas ssrs grouped  <dig> of these individuals in a new genetic cluster that we named k <dig> . contrary to the other clusters which display distinct distributions, k <dig> displays a disjoint spatial distribution largely embedded in the range of clusters k <dig> and k <dig> table  <dig> number of individuals assigned to each cluster at q =  <dig>  for snp and ssr analyses. numbers in bold in the diagonal indicated individuals jointly assigned by snps and ssrs to a same genetic cluster

regarding the order of appearance of genetic clusters as k
max increases, according to snps, the central african assigned-to-k <dig> individuals appeared as soon as k
max was fixed to  <dig>  whereas these same individuals  were isolated from the largest central african cluster only at k
max =  <dig> according to ssrs . another important difference came from the genetic cluster k <dig> grouping west african m. excelsa: it was detected at k
max =  <dig> with the snps, and at k
max =  <dig> with the ssrs. both types of markers grouped kenyan individuals with west african m. regia individuals at k
max =  <dig>  but distinguished them at k
max =  <dig>  snps and ssrs detected the gabonese cluster k <dig> only at their final respective scenario . as the most questionable genetic cluster was k <dig> given its disjoint distribution and its inclusion in k <dig>  according to the snps, we verified the morphology of all individuals from that genetic cluster and samples from the neighbouring genetic clusters. our observations confirmed that all the  <dig> individuals identified as m. regia according to the snp display the specific leaf feature of m. regia . individuals in genetic clusters k <dig> to k <dig> harbour microscopic hairs characteristic of m. excelsa.

finally, when using tess to evaluate the genetic structure among the m. regia genetic clusters, k <dig> of west africa and k <dig> of central africa, snps and ssrs markers were congruent, identifying two clusters , with no evidence of admixture according to ssrs, in contrast to the results from the snps  . even when we considered only central african clusters of milicia, there was no evidence of substantial gene flow between k <dig> and the surrounding populations . hence even for the snps, we will consider thereafter morphological m. regia individuals of central africa as forming a sixth genetic cluster.fig.  <dig> membership coefficient of individuals that present leaves of m. regia. a was based on ssrs whereas b was based on snps. k
max =  <dig> was considered for both figures




congruence of snps and ssrs in estimating diversity and differentiation parameters
a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals analysed were jointly assigned to the same genetic clusters by both types of markers, making an average concordance of 87% . in order to reliably compare ssrs and snps we considered only these  <dig> individuals for the estimates of diversity and differentiation parameters. ssr loci provided a total of  <dig> alleles whereas the  <dig> biallelic snp loci provided  <dig> alleles . values of diversity parameters tend to be lower with the snps than the ssrs due to the biallelic state of the snps. the trends among types of markers were similar if we consider only genetic clusters of the morphospecies m. excelsa: the kenyan cluster, k <dig>  displayed the lowest values whereas genetic diversity was in the same order for the other clusters k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig>  markers differed strikingly when comparing the two species: ssr data provided the highest diversity values for the west african m. regia genetic cluster, k <dig>  while snps displayed the opposite trend, with the clusters of m. excelsa exhibiting the highest diversity values . the proportion of polymorphic snp loci in m. excelsa was 100% whereas it reached  <dig> and 22% in m. regia genetic clusters k <dig> and k <dig>  respectively .table  <dig> diversity parameters among the six inferred genetic clusters in milicia populations. nae effective number of alleles, ar allelic richness, and he gene diversity corrected for sample size, npl proportion of polymorphic snp loci

there were also significant differences between snps and ssrs in estimating degree of genetic divergence in pairs of genetic clusters. for f
st, the values calculated from snps were higher than those from ssrs ; that trend was reversed if we considered d

phylogenetic reconstruction in milicia genetic clusters
for the two chloroplast regions, psba-trnh and trnc-ycf <dig>  only the m. regia genetic cluster in west africa  harboured specific haplotypes. individuals of the cluster k <dig> shared their haplotypes with the other m. excelsa populations .

the nuclear sequence at <dig> from  <dig> individuals exhibited a different pattern. first, individuals of the morphospecies m. regia found in central africa  presented specific haplotypes, h_ <dig> and h_ <dig> . determination of ffr through haploweb construction confirmed that contemporaneous mating does not occur between these central african individuals of m. regia and any other group of milicia individuals . m. regia in west africa  also displayed a specific ffr with eight haplotypes whereas m. excelsa populations from west and central africa  shared a unique ffr .fig.  <dig> 
at <dig> haplotype network and haploweb  in the genus milicia. circles that stand for each haplotype  are proportional to the number of individuals. the length between a pair of haplotypes is proportional to the number of mutations separating them. dashed curves link together haplotypes of heterozygous individuals. each surrounded group of haplotypes indicates a single-locus field for recombination  and the corresponding genetic clusters  are mentioned beside. individuals of the morphospecies m. regia are exclusively found in two genetic clusters, k <dig>  and k <dig> 




in terms of phylogenetic relationships, analyses of the nuclear sequence at <dig> showed that the clusters k <dig> and k <dig>  tend to depart from the other genetic clusters  but with a weak support . the most recent common ancestor of all genetic clusters was dated at  <dig>  mya . both phylogenetic trees from microsatellite and snps data based on d
s exhibited similar trends and contrasted with the at <dig> scenario on one point: the relative position of the m. regia cluster k <dig> that showed more affinity with the genetic cluster k <dig> than with the conspecific cluster k <dig> . the three phylogenetic trees agreed to identify the cluster k <dig> as the most divergent group. with microsatellite loci, the most ancient split was detected between k <dig> and k <dig>  dated between  <dig>  –  <dig>  mya.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees from milicia genetic clusters. the trees were constructed from at <dig> sequences , genetic distances d

niche overlap between milicia genetic clusters and correlation with genetic distance
the occurrence range of the six genetic clusters was well explained by the following climatic variables correlated to the first pca axis : annual mean precipitation, annual mean temperature, annual temperature range, solar radiation, and precipitation of the driest quarter . the niche model map of each genetic cluster is presented in the additional file 1: figure s <dig>  globally, niche overlap values were low, ranging between  <dig>   and  <dig>   . the mantel test between niche overlap values d and the genetic distance d
s resulted in a regression slope b = - <dig>   which was not significant . a similar analysis using d and 
 <dig> resulted in b = - <dig>   which was significant .

discussion
according to the sampling scheme and the markers used genetic studies can either detect or miss hidden genetic diversity. in particular the sampling approach may be a major issue. daïnou et al.  <cit>  did not highlight any particular genetic species specificity from a sample of  <dig> individuals of milicia because their sampling was not spatially regular . owing to new populations included in the analyses and a more homogeneous geographic sampling with a lower number of individuals , we showed that both ssrs and a few dozens of snps are good marker candidates to reliably characterize the genetic structure within a taxon.

as hypothesized, east african populations of milicia excelsa strongly diverge from the central and west african populations, a pattern found in other species  <cit> , and mirrored by the clear differentiation of the east africa flora compared to the remainder of the continent . but the most important finding came from the milicia genetic cluster k <dig> made of scattered central african samples morphologically similar to m. regia. this species is known to occur only in west africa westwards of togo, hence one may think that these individuals could be remnants of historical plantations of m. regia . however, we found no report of such plantations, while we rediscovered a century-old article reporting m. regia in gabon  <cit> . further investigations using other markers confirmed that the morphospecies m. regia observed in central africa is strongly divergent from the other populations of milicia:  the clustering pattern from ssrs that considered this group as a different genetic cluster;  the absence of gene flow with the other clusters; and  the haploweb outputs from the nuclear sequence at <dig> that identified all these k6-individuals as a separate field for recombination. furthermore, phylogenetic reconstructions suggested that the genetic cluster k <dig> is probably as old as the ancestors of all milicia populations. divergence among milicia genetic clusters looks to have been shaped by geographic isolation probably in relation to past ice ages but there was also a signal of habitat selection effect 
2).

discovering hidden genetic diversity: beyond the sampling scheme are the type of markers and the analytical tools
in case of weak morphological differentiation among taxa the discovery of cryptic species is most of the time a matter of chance  <cit> , unless there is some observation-based evidence of lack of mating between the sibling groups . at the beginning of the 21st century, barcoding techniques were used to detect hidden genetic diversity in the form of two or more phylogenetically distinct clades corresponding to slightly different phenotypic groups or having distinct geographical distributions  <cit> . the advantage of sequence data is that they require a low sampling density although it has been criticized  <cit> . detection of polyphyletic patterns may only be conclusive by maximizing the number of samples per geographical location and the number of places for collection. the major limit of phylogenetic approaches based on sequence data in addressing cryptic species issues is that the observation of paraphyly or polyphyly does not allow to identify species although reproductively isolated groups may exist. in the absence of population genetics data additional information such as allopatric distribution, substantial differences in morphology  or any other observations suggesting mating barrier may be necessary to argue for the presence of cryptic species . as a consequence the haploweb approach looks as a good alternative for species delimitation.

species delimitation via haplowebs has been proved to be better than coalescent approaches or gap detection method in species-poor data sets . however, haplowebs can also provide biased conclusions when population sizes and speciation rates are large  <cit> . milicia is not a young genus  <cit>  and as it is known to contain only a few species , we can argue that rapid radiation is not relevant here and should not affect performance of haploweb. but dense sampling can be a concern: more heterozygous individuals may contain rare shared alleles which may obscure the global pattern, leading to underestimation of the true number of species. with the exception of the cluster k <dig>  sample size per genetic cluster was quite high in the present study ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  that putative problem can be solved by using several independent markers for constructing the haplowebs, but this was not possible in our case because only one of the  <dig> tested nuclear sequences was polymorphic. specific haplotypes from the two chloroplast sequences were found for only one genetic cluster: the west african populations of m. regia. although not employed as much as trnh-psba, trnc-ycf <dig> got a certain success when combined with the former . trnh-psba is probably the most used plastid intergenic barcode after rbcl + matk  <cit>  and shows good species identification success rates  <cit>  including in moraceae such as ficus  <cit> . therefore it can be useful when aiming at revealing hidden species diversity . but it failed in the case of milicia.

milicia evolutionary history and incongruence between gene genealogies
haplotype sharing between the cluster k <dig> and m. excelsa individuals from chloroplast sequences may suggest either a strong relatedness between those populations along with incomplete lineage sorting, or past chloroplast capture. if we remove from consideration the west african cluster of m. regia k <dig>  the divergence time of k <dig> and its relatedness to kenyan cluster k <dig> composed of m. excelsa  supported the first hypothesis as this phenomenon is quite common in recently diverging species with large effective population size  <cit> . the chloroplast capture scenario is also acceptable. it is a common phenomenon between closely related plant species, and there are already several examples that are explained by such events . theory predicts that when a species extends into the range of a related species that can occasionally hybridize, a hybridisation event followed by recurrent backcrosses can lead to the capture of the chloroplast of the local species by the invading one  <cit> . we can thus hypothesise that this had happened in the past when ancestors of k <dig> penetrated the range of m. excelsa in central africa. additional investigations with new markers could help to identify the best scenario.

niche modelling techniques offer a good way to verify relationships between population genetic divergence and environmental selection. daïnou et al.  <cit>  already developed a scenario on the possible impact of past climate changes on population demography in milicia. the mantel test between 
 <dig> and niche overlap d performed in the present study resulted in a substantial and significant correlation . this should reflect signs of selection acting for the differentiation between the genetic clusters of milicia, even at intraspecific level for m. excelsa  <cit> , and this took place many thousands of years before as the modelling of niches was based on climatic data from the last glacial maximum . we need to moderate the value of the correlation as the outcomes of niche modelling for some milicia genetic clusters could be unreliable or incomplete. indeed, the outputs of those approaches, especially maxent technique, can be biased by samples provided for the modelling  <cit> . the west african samples implemented here in the environmental modelling was poor as it covered only a few countries whereas the genus occurs from senegal to nigeria in that region. therefore, we do think that further investigations related to niche characteristics should be conducted later in order to better assess signs of any putative selection effect on genetic cluster differentiation.

snps vs ssrs: high congruence for the contemporaneous genetic structure but divergent histories
due to the biallelic character of most of snps these markers are usually considered as less informative than polymorphic microsatellites to highlight a genetic structure, for a similar number of loci. hess et al.  <cit>  found that snp loci may require 8- <dig> times the number of ssr loci to delineate with equivalent power a mixture of individuals from differentiated populations . as our number of snp loci was  <dig>  times the number of microsatellites markers, we could thus expect similar power. it is probably more relevant to compare the total number of alleles minus the number of loci between the two set of markers, which gives 134-67 =  <dig> for snps and 65-7 =  <dig> for ssrs. thus, there would be a slight advantage for our set of snps. accordingly, in west africa, snps performed well to delineate the two species whereas ssrs exhibited a substantial proportion of putatively admixed individuals that may reflect a more limited power of ssrs to separate species, unless hybridization is more pronounced than assumed between m. excelsa and m. regia in west africa . however, snps systematically merged k6-individuals with west african m. regia individuals up to k
max =  <dig> . as the clustering solution of ssrs was clearly supported by the at <dig> sequences that demonstrated that k <dig> bears exclusive haplotypes, snps appeared less powerful than ssrs to discriminate genetic clusters in central africa.

another important difference between ssrs and snps was observed in the trend of genetic diversity among genetic clusters for each type of marker. whereas ssrs exhibited the highest sequence diversity in the west african m. regia cluster k <dig> , snps displayed much lower diversity values in both m. regia clusters k <dig>  and k <dig>  as compared to m. excelsa genetic clusters . ascertainment biases due to marker discovery protocols can explain those differences. in microsatellites, the hypothesis of length ascertainment bias states that the median or mean allele size of microsatellites is the greatest in the species or population that has served for the development of the markers. homologous loci in sister species may have different evolutionary histories so that a locus characterized in a sister species may not be as polymorphic as in the one from which ssrs have been derived  <cit> . in the present case, the ssr markers have been identified from a milicia excelsa individual  and their polymorphism was evaluated in a sample composed of  <dig> trees of m. excelsa and  <dig> of m. regia from ghana  <cit> . first, only three of the used ssr loci displayed a mean higher allele size in k <dig> comparatively to the other genetic clusters. second, as the highest ssr diversity was not found in the cluster k <dig>  there is no evidence of ascertainment bias in our ssr dataset. in fact, due to their high mutation rates, ssrs tend to be buffered from ascertainment bias comparatively to snps  <cit> . the snp markers used in the present work have been identified from two m. excelsa individuals from k <dig> and k <dig>  and the step of polymorphism screening for final marker selection involved only 17% of west african m. regia trees . as by definition snps are identified based on their polymorphism in the initially screened samples, ascertainment bias can be strong and this likely explains the much lower genetic diversity recorded in m. regia populations. as a snp generally results from a unique mutation event and snps were assessed between the m. excelsa populations k <dig> and k <dig>  only polymorphisms that appeared before the differentiation between m. excelsa and m. regia could remain polymorphic in both species. a comparison of snp loci in morphologically assigned m. regia genetic clusters showed that among the  <dig> loci which were polymorphic in k <dig>  only  <dig> were also polymorphic in k <dig>  only one locus was found polymorphic in k <dig> and not in k <dig>  this clear ascertainment bias highlights that particular care should be made for the selection of snps for genetic structure characterization and that starting from a broad genetic basis is preferable.

CONCLUSIONS
the present work highlights the value of large-scale genotyping of genera to discover cryptic species as well as highlight their hidden diversity at the intra-specific level. it is notable that, for a well-known timber tree, the occurrence of two species in central africa was not reported by botanists for a century although diagnostic leaf characters were known. additional morphological investigations are required to evaluate at which extent the central african new species of milicia phenotypically resemble to the other species. in particular, floral and fruit characters should be meticulously examined. additional file 1: table s <dig> provides a list of individuals that were identified a priori in this new species, taking into account the entire sample of the itto project. because our sampling was not performed in a way that rare hybrids would be detected, next samplings should target the contact zones between the three species in order to verify more thoroughly any interspecific hybridization pattern.

we suspect that many similar cases remain, and that the floristic diversity of tropical forests remains underestimated. recognizing cryptic species is particularly important for exploited species, like timber trees, as some of them might be endangered and require a special management policy while they are currently confused with a less vulnerable species. to identify cryptic species we showed that nuclear snps and ssrs can both be utilized and show similar resolution, while plastid markers are less reliable, a problem for current dna barcoding in plants based on rbcl + matk sequencing. however, snps are prone to ascertainment bias than ssrs, at least when assessing genetic diversity, so that their development should ideally start from a large sample size. we recommend to collect and genotype hundreds of samples covering the distribution range of the taxon investigated.
