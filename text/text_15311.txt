BACKGROUND
numerous evidences show that small non-coding rnas  exist in all three domains of life, i.e. eukarya, bacteria and archaea. bacterial srnas are normally between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in length. it has been demonstrated that many bacterial srnas act as regulators of gene expression, although the function of the majority of identified bacterial srnas is still unknown. recent studies have revealed that in bacteria srnas control various cellular processes, including acid resistance  <cit> , iron homeostasis <cit> , sugar metabolism <cit> , envelope stress response  <cit> , quorum sensing  <cit> , as well as virulence  <cit> . most bacterial srnas characterized to date regulate gene expression either by pairing to their mrna targets and thus affecting their stability and/or translation, or by binding to proteins to modify their mrna-binding activity  <cit> .

several experimental strategies have been employed to identify srnas <cit>  and approximately two hundred bacterial srnas in total have been discovered thus far. among the identified bacterial srnas, almost half were from escherichia coli  <cit> , and the other half were mainly from bacillus subtilis  <cit> , caulobacter crescentus  <cit> , listeria monocytogenes  <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , salmonella typhimurium  <cit> , sinorhizobium meliloti  <cit> , staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , and vibrio cholerae  <cit> . based on bioinformatics analysis, it is estimated that per bacterial genome may encode several hundred srnas <cit> . thus, there are still a large number of unknown srnas in bacteria including the standard model bacterium e. coli. very few srnas have been reported from plant pathogenic bacteria.

the gram-negative bacterium xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris  is the causal agent of black rot disease of cruciferous crops worldwide <cit> . this pathogen infects almost all the members of crucifer family , including important vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, mustard, and radish; the major oil crop rape; and the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. in recent decades, the black rot disease has become more prevalent and caused severe losses in vegetable and edible oil productions in many countries <cit> . in addition, xcc is the producer of the acid exopolysaccharide xanthan, which is an important industrial biopolymer and has been widely used as a viscosifer, thickener, emulsifier or stabilizer in both food and non-food industries <cit> . because of its agricultural and industrial importance, molecular genetics of xcc has attracted particular attention for over two decades. the entire genome sequences of three xcc strains have been determined and many important genes implicated in pathogenicity, xanthan biosynthesis, and other cellular processes have been characterized  <cit> . however, no srna has been identified from xcc so far. in this article, we report four srnas identified from the xcc strain  <dig> by generating and screening a cdna library of low molecular weight rnas, providing the first step towards an understanding of the function of srnas in xanthomonas.

RESULTS
construction of a cdna library of low molecular weight rnas from xcc
as mentioned above, to identify srnas in xcc we employed the approach based on a cdna library of low molecular weight rnas . this strategy, also known as small rna shotgun cloning, allows detection of srnas that are expressed in the bacterial cells grown at given conditions but does not require prior knowledge of srna characteristics  <cit> . this method has been proven to be one of the most efficient ways for srna identification in bacteria <cit> . we constructed a cdna library by reverse-transcribing the rnas with size ranging from about  <dig> to  <dig> nt, which were selected from the total rna isolated from the bacterial cells of the xcc strain  <dig>  <cit>  grown to the exponential phase in the medium xvm <dig>  a minimal medium mimicking plant cells  <cit> . since the rnas with size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt overlap in length with the very highly abundant 5s rrna transcripts , we excised the rna band with the size about  <dig> nt from the gel after electrophoresis to deplete 5s rrna and enrich for other srnas. by using the method described in methods, a cdna library containing approximately  <dig>  individual clones was constructed.

identification of srna candidates from the cdna library
about  <dig>  individual clones from the cdna library were exposed to sequence determination; of which,  <dig>  recombinant plasmids with satisfactory cloned sequences were obtained . the obtained insert sequences of these recombinant plasmids were individually aligned by blastn against the genomic sequence of xcc strain  <dig> on ncbi genbank database <cit>   and  <dig>  of them match to the genome . of the  <dig>  matched sequences,  <dig>  were derived from trna genes,  <dig>  from 5s rrna genes,  <dig>  from the 16s or 23s rrna genes,  <dig>  from orf -coding regions, and  <dig>  from intergenic regions  . the sequences of the  <dig> orf-matched clones all correspond to the sense orientation; therefore, it is probable that they are degeneration products of the full length mrnas encoded by the orfs. the  <dig> igr-matched clones are comprised  <dig> species. we considered these species as potential candidates of srnas and named them srna-c <dig> to srna-c <dig>  respectively .

aa total of  <dig> trnas were annotated in the genome of xcc  <dig> <cit> .

it is not surprising that  <dig> % of the clones were derived from trna genes, because the rnas used for the cdna library construction overlap in length with the highly abundant trna transcripts , which were not removed from the rna templates used for reverse-transcription in the library construction. the genome of the xcc strain  <dig> harbours  <dig> copies of trna genes consisting of  <dig> species distinguishable in sequences <cit> . the sequences of the  <dig>  clones derived from trna genes match respectively to  <dig> different trna species . on the contrary, it is surprising that there are still  <dig> % of the clones are 5s rrna transcripts, although the 5s rrna-included band was removed from the rna fractionization gel during the cdna library construction.

identification of srnas from the candidates by northern blotting
to further verify if the  <dig> srna candidates identified from the cdna library were authentic srnas, we performed northern blotting analysis using dna probes complementary to the original cdna clones of the candidates. the results showed that a single northern blotting signal band was clearly observed for each of the srna candidates, srna-c <dig> and srna-c <dig>  and the sizes of the bands were approximately  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length, respectively , which are consistent with the sizes of the corresponding candidate cdnas . we concluded that these two candidates are genuine srnas and named them srna-xcc <dig> and srna-xcc <dig>  respectively . for each of the candidates, srna-c <dig> and srna-c <dig>  two northern blotting signal bands were observed; a major band with small size and a very faint band with large size . as shown in figure  <dig>  the sizes of the major bands were about  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length, respectively, which are consistent with the sizes of the corresponding candidate cdnas . we concluded that they are real srnas and named them srna-xcc <dig> and srna-xcc <dig>  respectively. the faint bands might result from artificial hybridization of the srna-c <dig> and srna-c <dig> probes with unknown transcripts. the blots of the candidates srna-c <dig>  srna-c <dig> and srna-c <dig> showed signal band larger than  <dig> nt, much larger than the sizes of the cdnas, thus they are not like to be srnas. a summary of the analysis of these srna candidates is presented in table  <dig>  and the locations of the four verified srnas in the genome of the xcc strain  <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  interestingly, the gene encoding srna-xcc <dig> overlaps with the 5s rrna gene.

to gain a clue to understanding the expression of the identified srnas, we compared the expression levels of the srnas in the bacterial cells grown to exponential phase in different media by northern blotting analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression levels of the four srnas in the rich medium nyg and the minimal media mmx and xvm <dig> are very high and almost identical. this suggests that in exponential growth phase the expression of the four xcc srnas is not nutrition dependent.

5' and 3' end mapping, secondary structure prediction, and target prediction of the identified srnas
northern blots only provide information about the expression level and the approximate size of a transcript, but can not detect the exact position of the 5' and 3' ends of rna. to precisely ascertain the transcription start and stop sites of the identified srnas, 5' and 3' race analysis was performed . the results are given in additional file  <dig> tables s <dig> and s <dig>  since 5' and 3' ends of a srna may vary by a few nucleotides, at least  <dig> clones for each 5' and 3' race analysis should be sequenced, and the most upstream 5' nucleotide is regarded as the transcription initiation site and the most downstream 3' nucleotide is regarded as the transcription termination site. the 5' and 3' termini of the four identified srnas were determined by the above strategy and shown in table  <dig> 

after the 5' and 3' termini of the transcripts were identified, we assigned the most probable boundaries for the srnas, and the secondary structure of each of the resulting sequences was analyzed by using sfold  <cit> . the predicted secondary structures of the four xcc srnas are shown in figure  <dig> 

it has been demonstrated that most characterized srnas regulate gene expression by pairing to their mrna targets <cit> . as a first step in gaining an understanding of the function of the identified xcc srnas, we employed the computational software srnatarget developed by cao and associates <cit>  to predict their potential targets. the results, as shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  reveal that a large number of genes with various predicted or known functions, including some known virulence-related genes, are potential targets of srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig> and srna-xcc <dig>  suggesting that these srnas are probably implicated in the regulation of different cellular processes including pathogenesis. in contrast, only a few genes were predicted  to be potential targets of srna-xcc <dig>  implying that srna-xcc <dig> might be a structural rather than a regulatory rna. to ascertain the indisputable biological significance of these srnas in xcc needs further experimental investigations.

distribution of the identified srna genes in other bacteria
to determine whether the srnas identified above have any sequence similarity to other known bacterial srnas, a blast <cit>  was used to search the sequences of the srnas against the small rna database http://ncrnadb.trna.ibch.poznan.pl/blast.html. none of the four identified srnas displayed sequence similarity with any known srnas, indicating that these four xcc srnas are novel. to further verify whether homologous dna sequences of these srna coding genes exist in other microorganisms, we used the complementary dna sequences of these srna genes to perform blast searches against the ncbi total sequence database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html. the result, which is given in table  <dig>  showed that:  to srna-xcc <dig>  homologous sequences were only found in the genomes of the xcc strains atcc <dig> and b <dig> but not in any other sequenced bacterial species including the very closely related bacteria x. campestris pv. vesicatoria and x. oryzae pv. oryzae, indicating that srna-xcc <dig> may be an xcc specific srna; and  to srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig> and srna-xcc <dig>  highly homologous sequences were found in other species of xanthomonas and its closely related genus xylella, in addition to the xcc strains atcc <dig> and b100; however, no homologous sequence was found in any other bacteria.

xcc, x. campestris pv. campestris; xcv, x. campestris pv. vesicatoria; xoo, x. oryzae pv. oryzae; xf, xylella fastidiosa; xac, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, n, no similar sequence found.

CONCLUSIONS
a cdna library was constructed with the low molecular weight rna prepared from the xcc cells grown to exponential phase in the minimal medium xvm <dig> and seven srna candidates were obtained by sequencing screen of approximately  <dig>  clones randomly selected from the library. four of the candidates were confirmed to be srnas by northern blotting. bioinformatics analysis revealed that all of the four srnas are novel. their transcription start and stop sites were further determined by 5'- and 3'-end mapping. the secondary structure and potential targets of the four srnas were predicted bioinformaticsly, suggesting that a large number of genes related to various cellular processes of xcc may be regulated by the srnas. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on identification of srnas from a plant pathogen by a large-scale screen. the results provide useful information for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of xanthomonas campestris pathogenesis.
