BACKGROUND
directed protein evolution is invaluable in engineering biocatalysts for better properties, such as enhancements in activity, stability, and enzyme selectivity
 <cit> . however, it is usually limited by its inability to generate high-quality mutant libraries containing more beneficial variants. this is especially problematic considering the combinatorial complexity of mutant libraries and the huge sequence space
 <cit> . constructing focused mutant libraries at defined hotspot residues is considered to be one of the most promising ways of improving directed protein evolution
 <cit> . much of pioneering work has been complemented by reetz’s team
 <cit> .

all existing focused mutant library methods can be essentially classified into two categories: structure-based approaches and sequence-based approaches. the former includes combinatorial active site testing , b-factors, and knowledge-based potential analysis
 <cit> . the latter includes protein design automation 
 <cit> , residual coupling analysis 
 <cit> , and consurf
 <cit> . while the aforementioned methods depend primarily on the evolutionary conservation information to find out the hotspot residues, there are some other important functional and structural determinants desirable to be taken into consideration, such as the functionally correlated variation information--coevolution.

co-evolution is the correlated variation of protein sites promoted by selective pressures
 <cit> . the cooperation between residues at the coevolving sites, which usually takes the form of compensatory interactions, synergistic effects, allosteric interactions, and epistatic interactions
 <cit> , determines the structure and function of proteins
 <cit> . in recent years much attention has been paid to find the coevolving residues, as well as the reasons why residues co-evolve
 <cit> , but few experimental design methods based on the coevolution and successful examples of using them have been reported.

in this study, we propose a method, combinatorial coevolving-site saturation mutagenesis , which chooses the coevolving sites of proteins as hotspot residues to construct focused mutant libraries. we also describe the successful use of the ccsm method to improve the thermostability of α-amylase.

RESULTS
α-amylase is an important industrial biocatalyst in starch liquefaction processes and a valuable model enzyme for studies of thermal adaptation in proteins
 <cit> . we used the ccsm approach to improve the thermostability of α-amylase  to demonstrate the feasibility of this method.

spotting the coevolving sites in amy7c
six coevolving residues and  <dig> pairs of co-evolutionary interactions were identified in amy7c during step  <dig> of the ccsm approach . as shown in figure
 <dig>  among the six residues, h <dig>  d <dig>  and t <dig> are located in domain b, and g <dig>  d <dig> and n <dig> are in domain a. in domain a, the g <dig> is at the loop linking α <dig> and β <dig>  d <dig> is on β <dig>  and n <dig> is at the loop linking α <dig> and β <dig>  except for d <dig>  all the coevolving sites are situated exactly in the so-called “stability face” of amy7c. this stability face includes domain b and the loops linking the α helices with the subsequent β strands of tim barrel of domain a
 <cit> . the above observation of coevolving sites is consistent with previously published works, which demonstrated the thermostable mutations concentrated on the stability face, by conventional blind or rational protein engineering experiments
 <cit> . however, the coevolving sites of amy7c spotted by us in this work are distributed across a larger region than the stability face defined by other authors
 <cit> , and they are different sites from those identified by other authors
 <cit> .

the average distance between all coevolving sites in amy7c is in the range  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å, which is much greater than that reported by other research teams
 <cit> . the distance between coevolving sites are significantly greater than the distance used to define hotspot sites in previous studies, which is usually about 5 Å
 <cit> . the differences between the coevolving sites in this study and the hotspot sites found by previous studies must be attributed to the prediction methods, because the previous studies identified hotspots by evolutionary conservative information-based methods, such as the sequence alignment-based method and distance-based method
 <cit> , which could not usually find the coevolving sites located as distant as >17 Å apart.

construction and screening of ccsm libraries
ten ccsm libraries were constructed at coevolving-sites and explored using the hts method, which is based on the starch-iodine method and dns method
 <cit>  . all possible combinations and permutations of amino acid residues are explored in the ccsm library through simultaneous and random mutation of the coevolving-sites using the nnk degenerate primers .

a total of  <dig>  clones were randomly selected and screened using the starch-iodine method in the first screening. the majority of the variants displayed impaired activities, and only about 10% retained any obvious starch hydrolytic ability relative to parental amy7c. the active variants made up less than 5% of the three libraries of g89h <dig>  g89d <dig>  and g89t <dig>  active variants of the other seven libraries made up around  <dig> %.

a total of  <dig> potential hits in the initial screening were rescreened by the dns method using freshly transformed cells to discard false positives. in the  <dig> variants,  <dig> variants showed above 10% of the parent enzyme’s activity, and only  <dig> variants displayed more than 50% activities. the activity landscape of the top  <dig> variants is shown in figure
 <dig>  it can be seen that the top  <dig> variants, as shown around the dotted line in the first segment of the horizontal axis in figure
 <dig>  mainly came from d95h <dig>  g89d <dig> and d97n <dig> libraries, while variants from the h100d <dig>  d95t <dig> and d95d <dig> libraries showed relatively low activities.

rescreening of ccsm libraries
the top  <dig> variants  were rescreened by characterizing their relative activities and their
t5030values compared to the wild type, using freshly prepared crude enzymes. the average relative activity of the  <dig> variants was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> , in contrast to the  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of wild-type enzyme. the average
t5030value of the  <dig> variants was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c, compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c of the wild-type enzyme. a total of  <dig> variants had half-inactivating temperature above 58°c and retained more than 10% relative activity in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. figure
 <dig> depicts the relative activity and
t5030values of the top  <dig> in the  <dig> variants. from the figure
 <dig>  we can see that among the  <dig> most thermostable variants compared with the wild type,  <dig> contained one of the h <dig>  d <dig> and t <dig> sites, so it appears that these three sites in domain b are primarily responsible for the most thermally stable variants.
t5030values . the four representative variants n197c, h100i, t147p, and h100md144r are marked out by “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4”, respectively. the horizontal dotted line represents the relative activity of the wild type amylase, and the vertical one denotes its half inactivation temperature .

sequence analysis of the ccsm mutants
the sequence analysis of top  <dig> variants in the rescreening indicated that  <dig> variants  had not changed at all ,  <dig> variants  had mutated at single sites, and  <dig> variants  had double mutations at the designed co-evolving sites. table
 <dig> summarizes the amino acids and codons distributed over each site. most of the mutations observed in our ccsm library require a minimum of two nucleotide changes per codon, and some can only be by more than three nucleotide changes . these nucleotide changes are nearly inaccessible for conventional error-prone pcr and single-gene dna shuffling methods
 <cit> .

subscript numbers represent the frequencies of the codons in the  <dig> sequenced variants. underlined bold letters indicate substitution to the wild type nucleotide.

no. = total number of codons different from the wild type for each amino acid. type = type number of amino acids appeared at each site. w. t. = wild type.

all the coevolving sites showed dramatic variation in either single or double mutations, except d <dig> showed only two double mutations, i.e., d95ht147s  and g89fd95r . g <dig> and n <dig> were found to be the most diverse mutation sites, which displayed  <dig> and  <dig> different kinds of amino acids respectively . previous studies have shown that the eight strands and eight helixes of the tim barrel of domain a are vital to the stability of the structure
 <cit> , and few beneficial mutations can exist there. in this study, both d95ht147s and g89fd95r were found to involve changes to the residue d <dig> of the β <dig> in the tim barrel of the domain a. the detrimental effects caused by d <dig> site mutation must be compensated by the covariation at the other coevolving site, like the t147s in d95ht147s. the similar but beneficial cooperation may also take place between coevolving residues in improved variants. the positions and interactions between coevolving residues in some example variants are shown in figure a <dig> .

the aforementioned “false positive” phenomenon of high percentages of same sense mutations  and single mutants  upon rescreening should probably be attributed to the relatively lenient criteria adopted in our library construction and screening procedures. nnk degeneracy in the primers offers a variety of  <dig> codons and encodes all possible  <dig> amino acids, so it will inevitably produce same sense mutations in the library construction. meanwhile, the selection criteria for the sequenced  <dig> variants were set at above 58°c and at more than 10% residual relative activity, which are far below that  of the wild-type enzyme .

validation of the representative improved variants
to evaluate the effects of ccsm in improving the thermal stability of amy7c, the wild-type amy7c and four representative variants of n197c, h100i, t147p and h100md144r , were purified to homogeneity and characterized [see addition file
 <dig>  there appeared to be a tradeoff between thermal stability and catalytic activity of amy7c variants
 <cit> . amy7c showed a
kcatvalue of  <dig>  s- <dig> and a
t5030value of  <dig> °c. n197c showed a reduced
t5030value of  <dig> °c and a slightly higher catalytic activity
kcatvalue of  <dig>  s- <dig>  from the h100i, to t147p, to h100md144r, the
t5030values increased by  <dig> °c, 7°c, and 8°c, while the catalytic activities range from  <dig> -fold, to  <dig> -fold, to  <dig> -fold, respectively.

due to both the academic and industrial values, amylase has been extensively studied in different laboratories, and numerous engineering work has been done to increase the thermostabiliy
 <cit> . among the most excellent works, machius et al. have successfully identified some beneficial amino acid substitutions in an amylase bla from bacillus licheniformis  <cit> , and even created a hyperthermostable variant with 23°c higher than the wild-type enzyme by substituting  <dig> amino acids
 <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, if the test conditions and sources of α-amylases are not considered, the
t <dig> increase of 8°c observed in this study is the largest ever achieved with a single round by introducing up to two point mutations into wild-type α-amylases
 <cit> .

as a coevolving strategy, our method also identified stabilizing variants with only single mutations at certain coevolving sites, such as h100i and t147p mutations . from time to time, there is no difference between our coevolving method and traditional mutation methods such as error-prone pcr and dna shuffling in generation of stabilizing single mutations, but in fact our single mutation should be regarded as same as other coevolving double mutations since the newly introduced single amino acid has somehow improved the coordination between two residues at the coevolving sites, and made them perfectly match in certain performances such as thermostability.

so, the above validation results clearly indicate that the screened beneficial variants changed at the coevolving sites, and the new amino acid combinations and the cooperation between them at coevolving sites brought greater thermal stability than the wild-type enzyme. it also indicates that cssm may be more effective in generating desired mutations because it involves at least two coevolving sites that may be located in some far-away positions in protein sequences but more likely in the proximity to each other on the three dimensional structure of the proteins, and since it involves the coordinate changes in both amino acid positions they will then be more likely to co-evolve towards some direction we desired, which could be imagined as coordinated “directed evolution”, in sharp contrast to the ordinary “directed evolution”. the method proposed here only uses the protein sequence to detect coevolving sites, then employs combinatorial saturation mutagenesis to create mutations changing at both coevolving sites, and then screens out beneficial variants. so, it seems promising that the cssm method should be applicable to many interesting enzymes other than α-amylase.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that the new method of choosing the coevolving sites as the hotspots for constructing focused mutant libraries leads to improved variants with novel beneficial mutations at new sites. the successful application of ccsm in improving the thermostability of α-amylase in this study also throws new light on the active researches of the molecular coevolution.
