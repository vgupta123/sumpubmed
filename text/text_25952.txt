BACKGROUND
bioethanol is an important adjunct to fossil fuel because it is renewable, relatively environmentally innocuous, and compatible with the current fuel transport facilities. to date, bioethanol is mainly produced through the yeast-based fermentation of carbohydrates at about 33°c to give a final product concentration of 8–15%   <cit> . some novel processes, including high-gravity fermentation, high-temperature fermentation, and production from cellulose, intended to increase the economic and social benefits of ethanol, have been proposed and widely studied  <cit> . these processes, however, share the problem that they impose severe environmental stresses or inhibitors on yeast cells which greatly reduces their production efficiency. in addition, these stresses induce the formation of more by-products , consuming up to 5% of the carbon source  <cit> .

the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain s288c was, in  <dig>  the first eukaryotic genome to be sequenced  <cit> . in the 15 years that have passed since then, many functional genomic studies using the s288c genome as a reference sequence have greatly enriched our knowledge of how yeast cells respond to and resist various environmental stresses  <cit> . the information that has been produced cannot always be extrapolated to other yeast strains because of their diverse genomes and phenotypes  <cit> . compared with laboratory strains, industrial strains generally show higher adaptability to specific environments; however, the genetic basis for their improved characteristics is not well understood. comparisons of the genomes of strains with different backgrounds should help identify the sequence changes that play important roles in the tolerance of particular stresses. because of the progress in genome sequencing technology, some industrial yeast strains, including awri <dig>  ec <dig>  jay <dig>  vin <dig> and fosterso, have now been sequenced  <cit> . comparisons of the publicly available s. cerevisiae genome sequences have revealed the clear signatures , insertions and deletions , and novel orfs) of different strains  <cit> . however, further studies are needed to explore how the genetic variations confer the specific phenotype of each strain. of these industrial strains, jay <dig>  which uses sugar cane as feedstock, is the only bioethanol strain  <cit> . little is known about the genome structure and characteristics of other bioethanol strains.

in this study, we investigated the genetic characteristics of a bioethanol strain, yjs <dig>  and the molecular mechanisms that underlie its phenotypic differences from the laboratory strain, byz <dig> . yjs <dig> exceeded byz <dig> in fermentation rate and ethanol yield under different stress conditions, consistent with its greater tolerance of multiple stresses. comparative genomic hybridization array and whole genome sequencing revealed many differences in the genomes of these two strains, including snps, indels, novel orfs and changes in chromosome structure. finally, we used rna-seq to determine how the genetic differences might affect the transcriptional profile and physiological metabolism of the two strains. our study enriches the genetic resources for s. cerevisiae and deepens our knowledge of the effects of genetic variation on phenotypic diversity.

RESULTS
phenotypic and physiological characteristics of yjs329
in comparisons of fermentation performance, yjs <dig> had a slightly higher fermentation rate than byz <dig> but they each produced similar amounts of ethanol in a 38-h period under standard conditions . at higher temperatures and under higher gravity conditions, the ethanol yield of yjs <dig> was  <dig> % and  <dig> %  higher than that of byz <dig>  respectively . in addition, under the three fermentation conditions tested, yjs <dig> produced more glycerol, whereas byz <dig> produced more acetic acid . consistent with the fermentation tests, yjs <dig> grew faster than byz <dig> when exposed to stress factors  and yjs <dig> also exceeded byz <dig> in tolerance to the furan derivative hydroxymethylfurfural , a major inhibitory compound in the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates.

we compared yjs <dig> and byz <dig> using some of the main anti-stress indicators, including trehalose accumulation, antioxidation factors, hmf reductase, and membrane compositions. yjs <dig> accumulated  <dig> -fold  more intracellular trehalose, a nonspecific protectant that can maintain the function of macromolecules and membrane integrity under multiple stresses   <cit> . consistent with its better menadione tolerance, yjs <dig> showed  <dig> -fold  higher glutathione content and 5-fold  catalase  activity than byz <dig>  in yeast cells, glutathione and cat are important for the elimination of the reactive oxygen species that are caused by oxidizing agents or by other stresses  <cit> . hmf is formed as a result of hexose degradation during the process of lignocellulosic hydrolysis  <cit> . the chemical toxicity of hmf can be reduced by hmf reductase which converts the aldehyde functional group into an alcohol group in yeast cells  <cit> . compared to byz <dig>  the higher intracellular hmf reductase activity  of yjs <dig> might partly contribute to its increased resistance to hmf. the results in figure 1b show that, of the various membrane compounds, more ergosterol, palmitoleic acid , oleic acid , and linoleic acid  were detected in yjs <dig> . these findings indicated that there was significant variation in cellular components and physiological state between the yjs <dig> and byz <dig> strains.

genome structure of yjs329
the dna content of yjs <dig> was less than that of a triploid strain ztw <dig> but close to that of byz <dig> . after being grown in sporulation medium for 3–5 days, yjs <dig> showed an overall sporulation efficiency of 92%, producing mostly asci with two or three ascospores . the pulse-field gel electrophoresis  results revealed that yjs <dig> and byz <dig> differed distinctly in the length of their chromosomes; the exceptions were chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the karyotype of yjs <dig> is more regular than the karyotypes of some other industrial strains  <cit> , because the two homologs of each of the yjs <dig> chromosomes were the same length. the array-comparative genomic hybridization revealed that there were no big chromosomal aberrations in the genome of yjs <dig>  the regions of the chromosomes that were underrepresented in the yjs <dig> genome  compared with in byz <dig> contain  <dig> orfs . most of these orfs are located near the telomeres, long terminal repeat retrotransposons, or on tandemly repeated arrays. the regions of the chromosomes that were amplified in yjs <dig> relative to byz <dig> are shown in red in figure 2b. expressed products were identified for up to 50% of the orfs in the amplified segments . the expressed genes include three hexose transport genes , four genes involved in maltose metabolism , and four alpha-glucosidase genes . the region of chromosome  <dig> that was amplified in byz <dig>  led to the size differences between the homologs of chromosome  <dig> in this strain . the rt-qpcr results confirmed that this amplification was present in the parent strain by <dig> before the generation of byz <dig> in the present work . this rearrangement was apparently ty-derived as this region is flanked by the ty elements ydr180w-a and ydrcty1- <dig>  although the laboratory strains by <dig> and by <dig> have been used extensively in genetic research, this amplification has not been reported until now.

whole genome sequencing of yjs329
to investigate the genetic traits of yjs <dig>  we isolated the haploid strain yjsh <dig> which, under certain conditions, is indistinguishable in ethanol yields from its parent strain yjs <dig> , for whole genome sequencing .

snps
we identified  <dig>  snps within the aligned regions of the yjsh <dig> and s288c genomes . the average snp density was  <dig>  per kilobase throughout the genome but the density was not constant across individual chromosomes . a total of  <dig>  snps were found in the orfs and  <dig> % of them resulted in non-synonymous mutations. we observed that genes  with redundant functions tended to accumulate more snps, which was consistent with their lower hybridization signals in the array-comparative genomic hybridization. using the number of snps separating any two isolates as an estimation of their relatedness, we constructed a neighbor-joining tree that represented the genetic distances among  <dig> yeast strains. the tree shows that the bioethanol strains jay <dig> and yjs <dig> displayed the closest evolutionary relatedness to the wine and sake strains, respectively .

indels
based on the consensus yjsh <dig> genomic sequence,  <dig>  bp that were absent in yjsh <dig> were identified in the s288c genome and  <dig>  bp that were absent in s288c were identified in the yjsh <dig> genome . this analysis confirmed that some of the underrepresented regions in yjs <dig> genome  were sequences that either were lost in this industrial strain or acquired in s288c. for example, the yjs <dig> genome had only one copy of cup <dig> and ena <dig>  and none of the asp <dig> genes found in s288c. we also identified  <dig> ty elements in the yjs <dig> assembly , whereas  <dig> ty elements have been identified in the s288c genome. the amplification of the ty <dig> elements was consistent with the results of comparative genome hybridization for yjs <dig> .

orfs
a total of  <dig>  orfs  were predicted for the nuclear genome of yjs <dig> . predictions indicated that  <dig> orfs had in-frame stop codons,  <dig> orf were affected by frame shifts, and  <dig> orfs had lost start or stop codons because of the presence of snps or indels. for example, the ho gene of yjs <dig> had both an in-frame termination  and frame shift   that explained the heterothallic life cycle of yjs <dig>  in addition, the yjs <dig> genome has some orf sequences that were not present in s288c ; however, nearly all of these orfs could be found in the genomes of other s. cerevisiae strains. one such example is the orf eph <dig> that encodes the epoxide hydrolase  that catalyzes the hydration of chemically reactive epoxides to their corresponding dihydrodiol products. a recent study suggested that eph <dig> in the s. cerevisiae genome was the result of an introgression event from s. paradoxus and the s. paradoxus eph <dig> gene may itself be a result of horizontal transfer from bacteria  <cit> .

structural variations
compared to the strictly diploid s. cerevisiae s288c, many industrial yeast strains display chromosomal copy number variations . whole-chromosome amplifications had been observed in the awri <dig>  vl <dig>  fosterso and fostersb strains  <cit> . although no large chromosomal aneuploidy or length polymorphisms were observed in the genome of yjsh <dig>  some chromosomal rearrangement events in the yjsh <dig> genome were observed. the largest indel in the yjs <dig> genome was the  <dig> -kb deletion in chromosome  <dig> region . the 5’ end of chromosome  <dig> in yjs <dig> was apparently subjected to constant remodeling . in this region two elements from the s288c genome, chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> , and a region that is absent in s288c genome , were found in yjsh <dig> .

comparison of byz <dig> and yjs <dig> transcription using rna-seq
to investigate transcription differences at single-nucleotide resolution between byz <dig> and yjs <dig>  poly-enriched mrnas from byz <dig> and yjs <dig> were used for high-throughput illumina sequencing. overall,  <dig> % of the reads mapped to unique genomic regions; 81% mapped to known reference genes when 2-bp mismatches were allowed . compared to byz <dig>   <dig> of the yjs <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated . the functions of the up-regulated genes mainly fell within the oxidoreductase, peptidase activity and transporter-related processes categories . for example, sfa <dig> which is involved in the detoxification of formaldehyde and long-chain and complex alcohols formation  <cit>  displayed more than a 15-fold increase in mrna abundance in yjs <dig>  the fair number of the up-expressed genes involved in transport processes in the yjs <dig> sample suggested that this strain might have higher adaptability to multiple nutrition shortages than byz <dig>  the down-regulated genes were mainly involved in the functional categories of dna/protein binding, ribosome biogenesis, and structural molecules .

among these differentially expressed genes, we focused specifically on the transcriptional activity of the genes that are closely related to the anti-stress factors. consistent with the analyses at the physiological and biochemical levels, the genes in ergosterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the genes encoding catalases were highly expressed but to different degrees in yjs <dig> . we also found five transcription factors  which are known to be major regulators that control critical cellular processes and response to environmental conditions  <cit> , that displayed significantly different expression patterns in the two strains . transcription regulation network analyses  revealed that a large proportion of the up-regulated genes  was regulated by the msn2/4p transcription factor, whose expression is itself dependent on or induced by other transcription factors   <cit> . although the zinc-finger transcription factor hap <dig> has a larger number of reads per kilobase of exon region per million mapped reads  in byz <dig>  the hap <dig> protein is inactivated by a ty <dig> insertion in the carboxy terminus  <cit> . the absence of this interrupting ty <dig> element in the yjs <dig> protein may explain why the hap1-regulated genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and ergosterol, such as fas <dig>  fas <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  and erg <dig>  were expressed at a higher level in this strain . except for zim <dig>  most of the genes that code for heat-shock proteins and the transcription factor hsf1p showed less mrna expression activity in yjs <dig> compared to byz <dig> . an in-vitro experiment showed that the efficiency of the hsf1-promoter in yjs <dig> was 16% lower than in byz <dig> . compared to byz <dig>  a snp in the hsf <dig> promoter in yjs <dig> resulted in the loss of the hsf1p binding motif which may be important for the variations in hsf <dig> expression . furthermore, three amino acid substitutions in the functional domains of hsf1p may impede its interaction with the promoters of heat shock proteins; however, this supposition needs further experimental verification.

as well as the destruction of binding motifs in transcription factors, snps can also create new binding motifs. the msn2/4p and cat8p binding sites in the promoter of sfa <dig> from yjs <dig> are examples of new motifs that may strengthen the expression of the sfa <dig> gene  which plays a role in the detoxification of furan derivatives  <cit> . indels were also important contributors to transcription differentiation among the two strains. an obvious example in byz <dig> is the interruption of ctr <dig>  by the insertion of a ty <dig> element  <cit> . this insertion might explain the much lower expression activity of ctr <dig> in byz <dig> compared to yjs <dig> . further, small indels in the trans-elements can directly modify mrna expression and phenotypic traits in different strains. the down-regulated expression of ald <dig> in yjs <dig> , a major gene in acetic-acid formation, probably resulted partly from the insertion of two bases in the adr1p binding motif in the ald <dig> promoter . in byz <dig>  when the two copies of ald <dig> were deleted, the strain produced 56% less acetic acid and 17% more glycerol under the normal fermentation conditions . this result indicated that the lower expression of ald <dig> in yjs <dig> could be one of the causes of the different patterns of by-product  production in yjs <dig> and byz <dig>  chromosomal aneuploidy accompanied by cnvs in large dna regions is a ubiquitous phenomenon in yeast populations  <cit> . as indicated in figure 4e, the expression levels of regions with cnvs apparently dependent on gene dosage. the average read depth of the amplified region on chromosome  <dig> of byz <dig> was  <dig>  times that in yjs <dig>  close to the increased dna dosage.

using rna-seq, we detected the expression of the unique orfs at the whole-transcription-profile level. among these orfs , mel <dig> had the highest rpkm; others, such as yjm-gnat <cit> , showed minimal expression. additional file  <dig> shows the expression level and boundary of the predicted orf chr <dig> orf <dig>  which provides further evidence of the existence of this novel orf which is absent in other s. cerevisiae strains. rt-qpcr analyses revealed that the expression of some unique orfs depended on the growth phase and other conditions . when grown in ypd medium, all five of the selected genes  showed the highest expression at the exponential phase. the orfs yjs-he and mel <dig> were significantly up-regulated under ethanol fermentation, whereas the others were down regulated, indicating the different psychological roles of these unique genes.

genetic breeding strategies for yjs329
hsf1p is a conserved transcription factor that regulates hundreds of targets in response to multiple stresses  <cit> . optimized expression of hsf1p is important for yeast cells because either the deletion or overexpression of this gene leads to growth arrest  <cit> . to evaluate whether the lower expression activity of hsf1p and related heat shock proteins was be beneficial or detrimental to yjs <dig> under stress conditions, we expressed the hsf <dig> gene from byz <dig> in yjs <dig> using a low-copy plasmid. this genetic manipulation enhanced the cell viability of yjs <dig> by 57% and 25% after heat or ethanol treatment , respectively, indicating that the appropriate readjustment of the expression of important transcription factors can contribute to the adaptability of yeast strains.

more glycerol might improve the taste of alcoholic beverages but is undesirable for bioethanol production. when fps <dig>  was deleted in yjs <dig> to produce the yjsΔfps <dig> strain, the production of glycerol and acetic acid decreased and the conversion rate of glucose to ethanol improved by 1% compared with yjs329; however, the final concentration of ethanol was slightly less than in yjs <dig> because of the higher residual sugar in yjsΔfps <dig> . inspired by the different regulatory roles of ald <dig> in yjs <dig> and byz <dig>  we explored the possibility to further reduce the production of glycerol in yjsΔfps <dig> by overexpression of ald <dig>  beyond our expectation, strain yjsΔfps1ald <dig> produced similar amounts of glycerol but  <dig> % more ethanol  than yjsΔfps <dig> as a result of consuming more sugar than yjsΔfps <dig>  we found that the over-expression of ald <dig> could enhance the tolerance of ethanol in both yjs <dig> and yjsΔfps <dig> , which may explain the higher fermentation ability of strain yjsΔfps1ald <dig>  in addition, the over-expression of ald <dig> and deletion of fps <dig> significantly improved the tolerance of lignocellulosic hydrolysate  in yjs <dig> , suggesting that this strategy may be useful for breeding industrial yeast strains with the ability to increase ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.

discussion
the genomic structural analysis  indicated that yjs <dig> retained a diploid karyotype and had much lower structural polymorphisms than the bioethanol strain jay <dig> and some other industrial strains  <cit> . we also sequenced the genome of yjsh <dig>  using the illumina paired-ends method. after mapping the reads of yjsh <dig> to the yjsh <dig> genome, we estimated that the yjs <dig> genome had about  <dig>  snp/kb between allelic regions in homologous chromosomes . these results indicated that the yjs <dig> strain was genetically very stable, a desirable phenotype for industry practice. although s288c has been widely used in scientific research, because of the high number of ty elements, its genome seems to be more plastic  <cit> . high expression activity of ty elements in genes was confirmed in the s288c-derived strain byz <dig> as a result of a dose effect . the duplicated region on chromosome  <dig> in byz <dig> is probably the result of chromosomal translocations by ectopic recombination mediated by the flanking ty elements. strikingly, no dosage-compensation mechanisms acted to normalize the expression from each gene because the higher expression  of this duplicated region almost matched the higher gene dose . these results indicated that spontaneous ty-driven rearrangements could be quite common and, if ignored, could easily lead to incorrect experimental results in genetic studies, especially for the s288c-derived strains.

second-generation sequencing technology has proven to be an effective tool for the investigation of the genome sequences and structures of yeast strains and has provided many new insights into genome evolution and phenotypic effects  <cit> . the level of nucleotide polymorphisms between yjsh <dig> and s288c  is very similar to the level separating s288c and awri <dig> , yjm <dig> , m <dig>  or yps <dig>   <cit> , but, interestingly, yjsh <dig> was grouped closely with sake strains, consistent with their geographical distributions. to the best of our knowledge, yjs <dig> is the first bioethanol strain for which a high-quality assembled genome has been completed. the snps and indels that we have identified in the aligned regions of yjsh <dig> and s288c constitute the main genome mutations in these two strains. mutation frequencies were found to be higher in the intergenic regions than in the coding regions, we found that up to 40% of the snps and 88% of the indels were located in intergenic sequences . this pattern could arise from the sequence characteristics of intergenic regions . however, we also observed a considerable number of mutations in the orfs that play important roles in specified physiological activities. remedying some of these mutations may improve the capabilities or change the specified phenotype of yjs <dig>  a total of  <dig> orfs were predicted in the yjs <dig> genome that are absent from the s288c genome. remarkably, some of these orfs may be very similar to those in other saccharomyces species, including s. paradoxus, s. carlsbergensis, and s. mikatae. therefore, during the evolution of the yjs <dig> genome, repeated yeast hybridization events that were followed by the gradual loss of one of the contributing genomes might have occurred. undoubtedly, the genotypic characteristics of yjs <dig> that have been revealed in the present study will enrich the genetic resources of this species, which will be valuable for breeding strains with the desired phenotypes.

the recently developed rna-seq approach was used to explore the transcription profiles of the yjs <dig> and byz <dig> s. cerevisiae strains. among the  <dig>  differently expressed genes in these two strains, many were involved in the trehalose metabolism pathways, antioxidative factors, and membrane composition biosynthesis that are closely related to multiple stress-tolerance and fermentation characteristics. for example, consistent with the higher oleic acid content of membranes, the genes encoding the subunits of fatty acid synthetase , the acetyl-coa carboxylase gene , and the genes that function in fatty-acid desaturation and elongation  were considerably up-regulated in yjs <dig>  our results indicated that most of the differences in the physiological factors were consistent with the mrna transcription differences between these two strains. transcription –regulatory network analyses revealed that the transcription factors msn2/4p, hap1p, hsf1p, and arr1p might give prominence to the differently expressed genes and phenotypic differences between the two strains. this result was consistent with the observation that the trans variation is more common in expression polymorphism in yeast  <cit> . in spite of this, the contributions of cis variations on the divergence of mrna expression and physiological metabolism should not be neglected because our results confirmed that mutations in the promoters of some important transcription factors and genes could directly affect the efficiency of their promoter efficiency. overall, the molecular mechanisms underlying the mrna expression differences between yjs <dig> and byz <dig> might involve:  snps and indels in the cis-acting elements that affect the expression efficiency of the genes;  the inactivation of transcription factors by snps or indels; and  changes in gene copy number. remarkably, the discrepancies between the transcriptional profile  and the phenotype in the two strains might reflect variations in the activities of homologous proteins or posttranscriptional regulation, which deserve further assessment. in addition, here, for the first time, the expression activities of some novel orfs under different conditions have been determined. our study shows that whole-genome sequencing combined with rna-seq is a powerful tool for linking genotypes and phenotypes in functional genomic studies.

CONCLUSIONS
a thorough understanding of the genetic variations and how these variations contribute to phenotypic diversities is vital for the development of excellent yeasts for industrial applications. in this study, functional genomics has revealed the genetic characteristics of a bioethanol strain yjs <dig> and compared it to the laboratory strain byz <dig>  from the results of this study, targeted genetic strategies for yjs <dig> could be constructed. these strategies might include the introduction of wild type genes to remedy deleterious mutations in some of the strains, a heightening of the effects of beneficial mutations by gene deletion or overexpression, and the expression of novel genes to obtain specified functions. we expect that functional genomics studies of industrial microorganisms, such as those reported here, will, in the future, provide more effective means of improving breeding strategies to obtain the desired production traits.
