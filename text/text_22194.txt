BACKGROUND
in nature, free-living organisms are regularly found to be infected by an assemblage of different parasite species or genetically distinct parasite strains . in fact, multiple infections are the norm rather than the exception in diverse host-parasite systems, e.g., anther-smut disease  <cit> , malaria plasmodium spp.  <cit> , insect nucleopolyhedrovirus  <cit> , fungus gardens of the leaf-cutter ants  <cit> . coinfections also have implications for human health  <cit> . theory has emphasized the importance of multiple infections in a variety of evolutionary processes such as the emergence of resistance to drugs  <cit> , the evolution of sex in hosts coevolving with multiple parasites  <cit>  and particularly the evolution of higher levels of virulence  <cit> . in the absence of spiteful interactions among parasite strains  <cit>  or when the reproductive or exploitative rate of an individual parasite is not limited by the collective action of the coinfecting group  <cit> , most experimental studies suggest that the overall expression of virulence of multiple infections is either higher than the virulence of any of the coinfecting strains as measured in single infections  <cit> , or at least as high as the most virulent strain  <cit> . understanding the determinants of intra-host competition and predicting the course of virulence evolution are thus of outmost importance for public health, medicine and agriculture  <cit> .

the competitive outcome of multiple infections appears to be driven by several interrelated factors: the relative virulence of the coinfecting strains as measured in single infections  <cit> , prior residency of one of the parasite strains or species  <cit> , and the infectious dose used during simultaneous exposure  <cit> . the latter factor – infectious dose – is strongly tied to the parasites’ epidemiology. for example, variation in the infectious dose  is known to affect the probability of infection in single  <cit>  and multiple infections  <cit> . furthermore, the rate at which transmission stages are produced within the host could be influenced by the relative dose of its coinfecting parasites  <cit> . this is important, because all else being equal, a parasite strain that produces more transmission stages will have a greater representation in subsequent infectious doses. since virulence is proposed to be traded off against parasite transmission , it is crucial to understand how the relative dose of each of the coinfecting parasite strains can impact this trade-off. nevertheless, few studies examined how the relative parasite dose influences the expression of virulence and the production of transmission stages in the presence of multiple infections  <cit> .

another often overlooked factor that may affect the expression and evolution of virulence is the degree of specificity in host-parasite interactions. in theory, highly specialized parasites can evolve towards high levels of virulence . for instance, peak parasitaemia  was higher in specialist than in generalist malaria parasites of primates, when confounding life-history traits were controlled  <cit> . an earlier study of simultaneous and sequential multiple infections of daphnia magna using three isolates of its obligate parasite pasteuria ramosa suggested that the most virulent competitor produced most transmission stages  <cit> . however, p. ramosa clones  have recently been shown to exhibit much higher specificity than isolates . in other words, p. ramosa clones infect fewer d. magna genotypes than p. ramosa isolates, and therefore the host genotype range of p. ramosa clones is narrower than that of isolates  <cit> .

the present study experimentally investigates multiple infections in d. magna using infectious doses containing isolates and clones of p. ramosa in equal  and unequal proportions . by varying the relative representation of p. ramosa isolates/clones in the infectious dose  and by comparing virulence, host fitness and parasite fitness in single vs. mixed infection treatments, we aim at  exploring how the relative virulence in single infections affects the overall expression of virulence during mixed infections, and  assessing the effects of specificity  on intra-host competition. in the following we use the term single infections to refer to infectious doses containing either a single p. ramosa clone or a single p. ramosa isolate. we use the term mixed infections to refer to infectious doses containing a mixture of a single p. ramosa clone and a single p. ramosa isolate, or a mixture of two different p. ramosa isolates.

RESULTS
general effects
between days  <dig> and  <dig> of the experiment,  <dig> of  <dig>  d. magna individuals died for unknown reasons . such rates of early host deaths are not unusual  <cit> . none of the control d. magna became infected. controls were excluded from the analyses of infection rates and parasite spore production. infection rates in all infection treatments were above 90%. the few uninfected d. magna in the infection treatments were excluded from all analyses. time-to-host-death in the control group was on average  twofold longer than that of all infection treatments combined . host control animals produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  offspring per individual, whereas the average of the pooled infection treatments resulted in only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  offspring per individual.

virulence, host fitness and parasite fitness in single infections
we found a significant difference in virulence  among the five parasite isolates/clones, with isolates p <dig> and p <dig> being the most virulent irrespective of the infective dose used . pasteuria ramosa isolates killed their host faster than p. ramosa clones , regardless of dose . host offspring production was on average higher in hosts infected by isolate p <dig> than in hosts infected by the remaining isolates/clones, but it was invariant to dose . spore production differed among the five parasite isolates/clones, but was unaffected by dose . pasteuria ramosa isolates produced fewer spores than p. ramosa clones, regardless of dose . the results are similar with and without including the interactions in the model. since dose level only slightly increased virulence, and even then without interacting with parasite isolate/clone, in the following we only compared the higher dose, single infection treatments  with multiple infections consisting of spore mixtures where the total amount of spores is  <dig>  .

virulence in mixed infections
in the case of mixed infections with parasite isolate p <dig>  time-to-host-death was unaffected by the relative proportions of the other isolate or clone . mixed infections with p <dig> were as virulent as single infections with p <dig> . in the case of mixed infections with parasite isolate p <dig>  time-to-host-death was only unaffected by the relative proportions of parasite isolate p <dig> . in this case mixed infections with p <dig> were as virulent as single infections with p <dig> . although p <dig> was as virulent as p <dig> in single infections , mixed infections with low concentrations of p <dig>  and high concentrations of parasite clones c <dig> or c <dig>  were as virulent as single infections with c <dig> or c <dig>  respectively. mixed infections with higher concentrations of p <dig>  were as virulent as single infections with p <dig> .

host fitness in mixed infections
in the case of mixed infections with parasite isolate p <dig>  host offspring production tended to decline with increasing concentrations of p <dig> and c <dig> , though this decline was not significant. mixed infections with p <dig> and c <dig> in unequal concentrations  resulted in fewer offspring than single infections, but in equal concentrations  they resulted in more offspring than single infections . in the case of parasite isolate p <dig>  host offspring production did not differ among mixed infection treatments with p <dig>  c <dig> or c <dig> . overall, mixed infection treatments with p <dig> resulted in the production of significantly more host offspring than with p <dig> .

competitive outcome on day  <dig> post-infection
we used genetic markers to test for the relative success of the competing parasite isolates and clones within individual hosts during the growth phase  of the disease and upon host death. the superior competitiveness of parasite isolate p <dig> in comparison with p <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> was largely evident on day  <dig> post-infection . more precisely, by day  <dig> isolate p <dig> produced more spores consistently and increasingly by relative dose:  <dig> - <dig>  million more spores in concentrations of 10%,  <dig> - <dig>  million more spores in concentrations of 50%, and  <dig> - <dig>  million more spores in concentrations of 90% .

terminal competitive outcome
mixed infections with parasite isolate p <dig> in concentrations of 90% or 50% resulted in an almost complete exclusion of p <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> . only when p <dig> was present in a low starting concentration , both parasites succeeded in producing spores, but both suffered by producing fewer transmission stages than they produced in single infections . in these low concentration treatments, spore production by isolate p <dig> exceeded that of p4/c1/c <dig>  but the difference was not significant.

although parasite isolate p <dig> was as virulent as p <dig> in single infections, in mixed infections it was less competitive than p <dig>  only when p <dig> started with 90%, it mostly excluded the other strains . in lower concentrations  isolate p <dig> nearly excluded p <dig> , whereas in the case of p <dig> vs. c <dig> or c <dig>  each pair succeeded in producing spores, but both suffered by producing fewer transmission stages than they produced in single infections .

total spore production  did not significantly exceed the amount of spores produced by the parasite that produced more spores in the pair during single infections .

discussion
in single infections we found that p. ramosa isolates killed their hosts faster and produced fewer spores than p. ramosa clones. we also found that two similarly virulent isolates of p. ramosa differ considerably in their competitiveness when faced with coinfecting p. ramosa isolates and clones. while isolate p <dig> almost completely prevented the less virulent isolate p <dig> and the less virulent clones c <dig> and c <dig> from producing spores regardless of their relative dose , in the case of isolate p <dig> the relative dose affected the competitive outcome . despite p <dig> being a better competitor, single and mixed infections with p <dig> resulted in the production of more host offspring than with p <dig> . mixed infections were as virulent but not more virulent than single clone infections, and thus neither resulted in overexploitation of the host by the parasites , nor entailed additional costs upon the host because there was no further reduction in host fecundity . the competitive ability in treatments with equal concentrations  appears to be transitive, i.e., against both reference isolates p <dig> and p <dig>  isolate p <dig> competes better than clone c <dig> which competes better than clone c <dig>  although the p. ramosa isolate/clone with the higher starting dose has a higher likelihood to succeed, its success ultimately depends on its competitiveness . based on spore counts  <dig> days post-infection, it appears that the competitive outcome is largely decided during the first half of the parasite’s growth phase .

our results extend previous studies of multiple infections in the d. magna-p. ramosa host-parasite system, which were conducted using just parasite isolates  <cit> . first, we show for the first time that the effects of multiple infections by parasite clones could be different than those previously reported for isolates, because p. ramosa clones were less virulent yet produced more transmission stages than p. ramosa isolates. second, we show that p. ramosa isolates/clones vary in their within-host competitiveness and ability to induce host castration. third, we show that epidemiology  affects the outcome of within-host competition . taken together, these results highlight the need to investigate multiple infections using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes and under diverse epidemiological scenarios.

parasites that castrate their hosts are expected to inhibit host reproduction early in the infection process, in order to divert host resources for parasitic use  <cit> . the higher fecundity of d. magna singly infected with p <dig> in comparison with other isolates/clones suggests that some p. ramosa clones are more successful at inducing castration. if inducing castration bears a cost to the parasite, in the form of slowing down spore development and growth, then it may affect its competitive ability with other clones. in mixed infections, the inability of p <dig> to castrate its host as quickly as p <dig> may be compensated by the greater competitiveness of p <dig>  put differently, castrating the host after it has reproduced once may be less costly to the parasite than doing so immediately after penetration, and may allow the parasite to focus on replicating itself to achieve a competitive edge  <cit> . p <dig> might also be benefitting if coinfecting isolates/clones in mixed infection induce castration  <cit> . it could be argued that p. ramosa sterilizes d. magna mechanistically, e.g., by growing around its ovaries. this is likely to bear no costs to the parasite, and may be supported by the fact that antibiotic treatment is sufficient to regain host reproduction  <cit> . however, our day  <dig> post-infection data suggest that p <dig> grows faster than its competitors, despite delaying castration. furthermore, it is not unusual for infected d. magna to release a clutch after a long period of castration.

the transitive relationship in competitiveness in mixed infections with equal concentrations  is in line with their relative virulence in single infections . this suggests that when both parasite strains have equal chances to infect the host , their relative virulence in single infections may point to their competitive success in mixed infections. similar results have been reported in a rodent malaria host-parasite system  <cit> . our study extends these results by showing that even in unequal concentrations p <dig> produced more or at least as many spores as c <dig> and c <dig> during mixed infections with p1/p <dig>  despite its significantly lower spore throughput in single infections. therefore, the ability of a parasite to transmit under conditions of frequent multiple infections ultimately depends on its competitiveness, and that a parasite’s relative virulence  in single infections serves as a good indicator of its competitive ability. moreover, if more virulent parasite strains are more often better competitors, frequent multiple infections will lead to higher levels of virulence  <cit> .

pasteuria ramosa clones have been found to exhibit strong gxg interactions for infectivity  <cit> . some d. magna clones exhibit either complete resistance or complete susceptibility to infection that is governed by a simple genetic basis . although the specificity of attachment to the host esophagus depends on both host and parasite genotypes  <cit> , the specificity of p. ramosa proliferation within d. manga is poorly understood. it is also unknown whether the number of successful infections  affects parasite replication rates within the host and the resulting spore load. single-spore infection trials in the laboratory suggest that even though a single p. ramosa spore can cause disease, the likelihood of such an event is extremely low . spores that do not penetrate do not seem to be targeted by any innate immunity  <cit> . it might very well be that if p. ramosa spores penetrate the host in small numbers, they are cleared by the host’s innate immune system before they are able to proliferate  <cit> . direct interference or apparent competition among different p. ramosa clones may also reduce proliferation  <cit> . since it is likely that p. ramosa isolates consist of more than one clone, some of which may be incompatible with the d. magna clone used in this experiment, we conjecture that a combination of proliferation specificity and inter-clone competition may explain why p. ramosa clones produced more spores than isolates. in other words, infection by a p. ramosa clone would maximize parasite fitness better than infection by a p. ramosa isolate. it remains to be determined whether the observed gxg interactions for infectivity also apply to within-host competitiveness and virulence .

our finding that the competitive outcome is largely determined during the first half of the parasite's growth phase may be explained in several ways. first, the replication rates of successful competitors may be considerably higher than those of their counterparts, as evident from spore counts on day  <dig> post-infection. second, direct interference or apparent competition might take place very early in the infection process e.g.,  <cit> , and clear out or considerably harm less competitive p. ramosa clones. lastly, successful competitors might be able to facultatively upregulate their replication rates upon detection of another genotype within the same host, and thus express higher virulence  <cit> . to provide support to one or more of these conjectures would necessitate monitoring the competitive outcome during the initial growth phase while controlling for the number of successful infections.

interestingly, the virulence of p. ramosa clones was lower than that of isolates. in theory under a scenario of resource competition, kin selection should reduce the increase in virulence per genotype in multiple infections by closely-related competing genotypes  <cit> . however, the relationship between virulence and relatedness depends on the social behavior displayed by the parasites, i.e., prudent exploitation, public goods cooperation or spite  <cit> . evidence for reduced overall virulence in coinfections by closely-related parasite strains compared to unrelated strains is scarce  <cit> . under the assumption that more than one p. ramosa spore penetrates the host during seven days of exposure, the present study provides additional support for the prediction that high relatedness selects for prudent exploitation and thus low virulence. this is because the difference in virulence between p. ramosa clones and isolates could be explained by <100% relatedness of genotypes in isolate infections. this latter statement assumes that a p. ramosa isolate consists of more than one p. ramosa clone. it remains to be seen whether the increase in overall virulence under multiple infections with potentially unrelated genotypes resulted from increased host exploitation or the inability of the d. magna immune system to cope with antigenic diversity  <cit> .

the dose levels used in the present study were chosen to achieve high infection rates . infection prevalence in natural populations of d. magna varies widely and may reach in certain ponds or years 100%  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether naturally occurring d. magna populations are exposed to concentrations of p. ramosa spores similar to those administered in our experiment. lower spore concentrations may decrease the likelihood of multiple infections, and thus alter both within- and between-host dynamics. for example, if multiple infections are rare, less virulent p. ramosa clones that produce more transmission stages may be selected over more virulent clones that are less infective and/or produce fewer transmission stages  <cit> . we do not expect different dose–response relationships for lower levels of infection, in terms of within-host competitiveness, overall virulence and parasite transmission. however, changes in the likelihood of multiple infections will affect the evolution of virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
the main finding of this study is that parasite isolates differ from parasite clones in their virulence and lifetime spore production of an infection. moreover, parasite isolates/clones differ in their within-host competitiveness and ability to induce host castration. finally, the relative virulence and relative dose of coinfecting parasite strains strongly affect the competitive outcome. taken together, our results emphasize the importance of epidemiology as well as of various parasite traits in determining the outcome of within-host competition. incorporating realistic epidemiological and ecological conditions when testing theoretical models of multiple infections  <cit> , as well as using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes, will enable us to better understand the course of virulence evolution.
