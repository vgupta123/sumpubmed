BACKGROUND
drought and salt stress are major abiotic constraints affecting plant growth worldwide. the first phase common to drought and salt stress is osmotic stress  <cit> . because of their sessile lifestyle, plants have developed mechanisms to avoid or cope with the consequences of water stress. previous studies showed that plants have developed different signal transduction pathways and gene expression regulation mechanisms to perceive and respond to water deficiency . the mechanism of the response to drought included both abscisic acid -independent and aba-dependent signalling cascade pathways, as well as the expression of drought-related genes, such as dreb and nac . the aba-responsive element  and its binding transcription factors are involved in aba-dependent gene expression. similarly, the dehydration-responsive element  and its binding protein  <dig> transcription factors play pivotal roles in aba-independent gene expression in response to osmotic stress  <cit> . aba synthesised after water deficit potently inhibits stomatal opening and promotes stomatal closure to prevent water loss. in addition, aba-activated gene expression is associated with plant adaption to drought, involving genes such as rd <dig>  rd29a, kin <dig>  and kin <dig>  <cit> . however, the mechanism underlying the early response to osmotic stress in plants remains undiscovered.

the early events of plant adaptation to drought stress include perception of osmotic changes and consequent stress signal transduction cascades, leading to the activation of various physiological and metabolic responses, including stress responsive gene expression. a total of  <dig> cdnas of the early response to dehydration  genes were isolated from arabidopsis after treatment with dehydration for 1 h  <cit> . erd <dig> encodes a protein containing a highly conserved duf <dig> domain , which is common to various species . on the other hand, osmotic stress and various other stimuli trigger increases in the cytosolic/intracellular free calcium concentration  in plants  <cit> . the hyperosmolality-induced i increase  occurs within 5 s, which may be the earliest detectable event in plants  <cit> . blocking oici disrupts drought and aba-induced gene expression, suggesting that the precise regulation of oici is crucial for activation of many signal transduction pathways triggered by external stimulation; this process is important in understanding plant sensing of external osmotic stress and other stimulations. previous studies showed that osmotic/mechanical stimuli-gated ca2+-permeable channels serve as osmosensors in bacteria and animals  <cit> , which indicated that oici in plants is mediated by specific calcium permeable channels that function as osmosensors.

using a calcium-imaging-based unbiased forward genetic screening strategy, yuan et al. isolated several arabidopsis mutants  that showed low oici, and further characterised osca <dig> as a previously unknown hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channel, suggesting that osca <dig> may be an osmosensor in arabidopsis  <cit> . osca <dig> belongs to a gene family with  <dig> members in arabidopsis, and homologues are found in other plant species and throughout eukaryotes. in this family, osca <dig>  encoded an erd <dig> protein  <cit> . yuan et al. also reported that osca <dig> -knockout mutants displayed normal oicis, suggesting that osca <dig>  may differ from osca <dig>  reminiscent of the diverse functions of trps  in animals  <cit> .

in the present study, we characterised osca family members in four species of the oryza genus in silico and analysed the phylogenetic relationships among these oscas, as well as their expression profiles in various organs/tissues and under different osmotic-related abiotic stresses. these results can be used for functional validation studies of the rice osca genes and increase our understanding of the roles of plant oscas.

RESULTS
identification of osca genes
to explore the entire osca gene family in rice, we used the sequence of  <dig> atoscas to search against the oryza sativa l. ssp. japonica genome in rgap  and the genome of oryza sativa l. ssp. indica, oryza glaberrima, and oryza brachyantha from the ensembl genomes database at the e-value of 1e- <dig>  the presence of conserved duf <dig> domain in their protein structure is the excusive criterion to confirm the oscas with the smart program . by removing sequence redundancies and alternative splice forms of the same gene, we identified  <dig> putative osca genes and named them ososca <dig>  to ososca <dig> , in accordance with arabidopsis orthologues . ososca <dig>  was oserd <dig>  as reported previously  <cit> . next, we identified  <dig> osioscas,  <dig> ogoscas, and  <dig> oboscas in oryza sativa l. ssp. indica, oryza glaberrima, and oryza brachyantha, respectively . there are two orthologues of osca <dig>  in oryza glaberrima, named ogosca <dig> _ <dig> and ogosca <dig> _ <dig>  which was indicative of gene duplication after oryza glaberrima had split from the rice species.

phylogenetic relationship and gene structure of rice oscas
to compare the evolutionary relationship of oscas among four rice species, a phylogenetic tree was generated using the cds  of  <dig> oscas. we found that members of the osca family were separated into four distinct clades, designated i, ii, iii, and iv . clade i included four members—osca <dig> , osca <dig> , osca <dig> , and osca <dig> ; clade ii contained five members—osca <dig> , osca <dig> , osca <dig> , osca <dig> , and osca <dig> ; clades iii and iv contained only osca <dig>  and osca <dig> , respectively. the osca gene phylogenetic tree revealed that two subspecies of cultivated rice, oryza sativa l. ssp. japonica and oryza sativa l. ssp. indica, were more closely related than wild rice oryza glaberrima, while oryza brachyantha was less closely related. excluding clade iv, which contained five orthologue members, all other clades contained four orthologue, suggesting that the osca gene had duplicated, resulting in different members of the family in the ancestral species before speciation.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships and gene structures of oscas in o. sativa l. ssp. japonica, o. sativa l. ssp. indica, o. glaberrima, and o. brachyantha. a. a phylogenetic tree of oscas was constructed from a complete alignment of  <dig> osca cds sequences using the neighbour-joining method with bootstrapping analysis . bootstrap values are indicated at each node. the branches of different clades are indicated by different colours. b. gene structures of oscas were identified using the gene structure display server. the horizontal black lines, the green boxes, the thick blue lines, and the numbers in the top right corner of the green boxes indicate the position of introns, the position of exons, the position of utr , and the intron phase, respectively. the length of the horizontal black lines and the green boxes represent the relative lengths of corresponding introns and exons within individual protein sequences. the scale bar at the bottom right represents a  <dig> -bp length of cds



previous studies have shown that the exon/intron diversification among gene family members plays an important role in the evolution of multiple gene families through three main mechanisms: exon/intron gain/loss, exonisation/pseudoexonisation, and insertion/deletion  <cit> . the numbers and positions of exons and introns in oscas were determined by comparing full-length cdna sequences and the corresponding genomic dna sequences of each ososca gene using gene structure display server  <dig>  . we found that all osca genes contained multiple exons with the exception of osca <dig> . moreover, in the same clade in the phylogenetic tree, most members shared almost identical intron/exon structures and intron phases . this finding further validated the nomenclature proposed by our phylogenetic analysis, and the main structural characteristics in the gene and protein sequence of oscas were formed prior to the split between wild and cultivated rice. however, further studies are required to elucidate the specifics of a functional divergence among the osca genes.

the conserved domain of oscas
we used the smart to confirm the structural characterisation of the oscas and found that most ososcas contained four main modular architectures, the transmembrane helices  region, the low-complexity region, a coiled-coil region, and the duf <dig> domain, although the number of amino acids in the oryza genus varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . the tm in oscas were predicted using tmhmm server v.  <dig> . we found that different osca members contained 6– <dig> tms, and the same osca orthologue in the four rice species contained the same number of tms with three exceptions. ososca <dig>  and obosca <dig>  had three tms fewer than their orthologues, which suggested that a deletion event occurred in the genomes of ososca <dig>  and obosca <dig> ; osca <dig>  had also two tms fewer in two subspecies of oryza sativa l. than its orthologues in oryza glaberrima and oryza brachyantha. however, there is no deletion in the genomes of ososca <dig>  and osiosca <dig>  .

the entire osca family is characterised by the presence of a conserved duf <dig> domain, which functions as an osmotic-sensing calcium channel  <cit> . according to interpro  pfam, duf <dig> represents the seven transmembrane domain region of calcium-dependent channel and is homologous to domains in anoctamin/tmem <dig> channels, which are calcium-activated chloride channel  components  <cit> , and salt taste chemosensation transmembrane channel-like  proteins in c. elegans  <cit>  or mechanosensitive tmcs in hair cells of the mammalian inner ear  <cit> . multiple sequence alignment was performed to clarify the characteristics of duf <dig> in  <dig> ososcas . in general, the core region of duf <dig> contained four to six tm regions; tm1-tm <dig> were highly conserved in all ososcas, while tm4-tm <dig> were not. we also identified  <dig> conserved amino acid residues in the duf <dig> region of ososcas, a <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  p <dig>  w <dig>  l <dig>  p <dig>  f <dig>  and y <dig> of ososca <dig> , which could be associated with the channel characteristics of oscas.fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment and transmembrane region of the duf <dig> conserved region in ososcas. multiple sequence alignments of oscas were performed using dnaman and the transmembrane region of the duf <dig> conserved region was predicted using tmhmm. the region between two vertical red lines represents the duf <dig> conserved region. identical , conserved , and blocks  of similar amino acid residues are shaded in dark navy, pink, and cyan, respectively. identical or similar amino acid residues are shown in lowercase abbreviations at the bottom of the corresponding rows. the transmembrane regions are marked by black lines and called tm1-tm6



expression analysis of ososca in various organs
to unveil the potential function of ososcas in rice, the expression profiles of ososca genes in various tissues and organs were first determined using qrt-pcr  and represented in grey scale to facilitate visualisation: 30-day-old root ; 30-day-old shoot ; mature stem ; mature flag leaf ; stamen ; pistil ; and mature seed . the  <dig> ososca genes showed tissue-specific expression patterns . five genes, ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig> , were highly expressed in all tissues tested, which was indicative of a universal role of these ososcas in osmotic-sensing processes throughout the plant. ososca <dig>  and ososca <dig>  showed medium transcript abundances in all tissues tested. ososca <dig>  was detected only in the stamen, indicative of a specific function therein. ososca <dig>  and ososca <dig>  had relatively higher transcript abundance in the stamen and low transcript abundance in other tissues. ososca <dig>  had high transcript abundance in the shoot and stamen, but low levels in other tissues. these results indicated that the ososca genes were involved in various physiological and developmental processes in rice.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of organ-specific expression of the ososca genes. the expression levels of  <dig> ososcas were monitored using qrt-pcr. the values were normalised to the control gene  and represented using a colour scale to facilitate visualisation. the letters at the top indicate the selected tissues and organs: 30-day-old root , 30-day-old shoot , mature stem , mature flag leaf , stamen , pistil , and mature seed . the colours white, light grey, dark grey, and black represent the multiple ranges of ososcas mrna expression levels, which were < <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> , and > <dig>  compared with actin, respectively. the values represent the average of three independent biological replicates



expression of ososcas during caryopsis development
to explore the transcriptional expression of ososcas during caryopsis development after pollination, we extracted expression data of ososcas from a published microarray database  and re-analysed their expression levels during various rice reproductive developmental stages, including panicles at different stages  and developmental seeds after pollination . at least one probe for each ososca was present on the rice whole genome affymetrix array platform . the  <dig> ososca genes were divided into three subgroups, i-iii, according to their similar expression patterns . ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig>  in subgroup i were expressed with high abundance in all reproductive developmental stages of rice. subgroup ii contained three genes, ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig> , expressed with very low abundance in almost all tissues examined. subgroup iii included the remaining five ososcas and showed medium abundance in all organs. more interestingly, several ososcas, including ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig> , showed gradually increased expression levels during seed development, which was confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis of the expression levels of ososca genes during caryopsis development . however, we found that the transcript levels of ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig>  were increased in the developing caryopsis from the middle stage of caryopsis development  to the last stage . a decrease in ososca <dig>  and ososca <dig>  transcript levels was detected in the caryopsis from the earliest to the last stage of caryopsis development. ososca <dig>  transcript levels were higher in the caryopsis during the earliest and middle stages of development, while the expression of ososca <dig>  was unchanged during caryopsis development . we used the relative water content, which showed gradually decreased, as a control for caryopsis development . fig.  <dig> expression profiles of ososca genes during panicle and caryopsis development. a. the microarray data sets  of ososca gene expression in organs at various developmental stages were reanalysed . the average log signal values of ososca genes are presented in the form of a heat map. the colour key represents average log <dig> expression values of ososca genes. the samples are indicated at the top of each lane. the following stages of panicle development are indicated as follows: p <dig>  0–3 cm; p <dig>  3–5 cm; p <dig>  5–10 cm; p <dig>  10–15 cm; p <dig>  15–22 cm; and p <dig>  22–30 cm. the following stages of caryopsis development are indicated as follows: s <dig>  0– <dig> dap ; s <dig>  3– <dig> dap; s <dig>  5– <dig> dap; s <dig>  11– <dig> dap; and s <dig>  21– <dig> dap. a colour scale representing the average log signal values is shown on the right. b. the expression levels of ososca genes during caryopsis development were monitored using qrt-pcr. samples were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dap. the relative water content in corresponding stages is shown in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  the relative mrna levels of individual genes were normalised to that of actin. error bars indicate the standard deviations  of three biological replicates



expression of ososcas in the progress of rice seed imbibition
imbibition is the first and essential phase for seed germination. water content gradually increases in seeds during this period, leading to a less negative water potential. thus, it was important to explore whether the expression of ososcas corresponded to osmosis variation during seed imbibition. we found that the expression levels of ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig>  were decreased during seed imbibition, from the start until 20 h, while the water content increased . furthermore, the lower ososca transcription levels were in accordance with the increased water content during seed imbibition in 18 % and 30 % peg   <dig> solutions, respectively. thus, the transcription of most ososca genes was correlated with the water potential in imbibed seeds, which indicated that ososcas play an important role in sensing and/or responding to osmotic changes to regulate seed germination.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of ososcas during peg-treated seed imbibition. the expression levels of  <dig> ososcas were monitored using qrt-pcr. the peg concentration  values are represented using the colour scale shown at the top. samples were collected after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h of treatment with the corresponding concentration of peg . water content in the samples is shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  the relative mrna levels of individual genes were normalised to that of rice actin. error bars indicate the sd of three biological replicates. the star indicates statistically significant differences  according to tukey’s multiple range test



orchestrated transcription of several ososcas by the circadian clock
water in plants is transported primarily from the root to the shoot through the transpiration stream driven by evaporation. the transpiration rate is governed by stomatal conductance, which displays diurnal oscillations  <cit> . thus, the water potential in the stomatal apoplast is synchronised to stomatal conductance oscillations, which may determine the circadian expression of ososcas. to test this hypothesis, we analysed the expression profiles of all ososcas in the shoots of four-leaf-stage rice seedlings under 14-h light /10-h dark  conditions, and found that ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig>  were subjected to a circadian rhythm at the transcriptional level . during the day, stomata opening results in water loss via transpiration and higher water potential in the apoplast, which may gradually decrease the expression of ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig> . conversely, stomata closing at night will trigger the transcription of these three ososcas, which will peak following the dark to light transition. except those three ososcas, the expression of others was independent of the circadian rhythm. we used oslhy, which exhibited robust rhythmic expression under diurnal conditions, as a positive control in this experiment   <cit> .fig.  <dig> circadian rhythmic expression of several ososcas. expression levels of ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig>  in shoots of four-leaf stage zh <dig> seedlings under 14-h light /10-h dark  photoperiod conditions were analysed using quantitative real-time rt-pcr. samples were collected every 3 h. data were normalised against actin expression. the expression of marker gene is shown in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  error bars indicate the sd of three biological replicates



expression profiles of ososcas under osmotic-related abiotic stresses
to determine whether the expression of ososcas is responsive to osmotic-related abiotic stress, qrt-pcr analysis of the ososcas at the four-leaf stage in rice was performed under different stress treatments: peg  <dig> , nacl , drought, and aba . we found that nine ososca genes were down- or upregulated  in at least one of the stress conditions examined as compared with the control, except for ososca <dig>  and ososca <dig>  . in detail, the expression of five genes, ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig> , were upregulated by all four kinds of treatment. ososca <dig>  was upregulated by peg and salt stress as well as aba treatment, while ososca <dig>  was upregulated by peg and salt stress. we also found that ososca <dig>  was specifically downregulated by drought stress and upregulated by aba treatment. ososca <dig>  was downregulated after peg stress and aba treatment. the expression of marker genes, per24p for peg treatment  <cit> , dsm <dig> for salt  <cit> , osp5c for drought  <cit> , abi <dig> for aba  <cit> , is shown in additional file 9: figure s <dig>  we also investigated the expression of three housekeeping gene: actin , eef1a  and ubq <dig>  under different abiotic stresses and calculated the gene expression stability values  of these three genes, which was  <dig>  for actin,  <dig>  for eef1a and  <dig>  for ubq <dig>  respectively . the m value of three genes is below the threshold value of  <dig> , which showed that actin gene is suitable for using as the internal controls to normalize the expression of osca genes in rice. these results indicated that ososcas might be involved in osmotic-related signalling pathways and play pivotal roles in the responses to various abiotic stresses in rice.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of ososca genes under different abiotic stresses. the relative expression levels of ososcas were determined using quantitative real-time rt-pcr in the roots  of four-true-leaf-stage seedlings treated with 20 % peg  <dig>  150 mm nacl, or 100 μm aba, compared with the control. the mrna levels were normalised to that of actin. the white and grey bars represent  <dig> and 1 h after treatment, respectively. the dark bars represent 6 h after treatment with nacl or drought, and 24 h after treatment with ck, peg, or aba. the expression levels of marker genes are shown in additional file 9: figure s <dig>  error bars indicate the sd of three biological replicates. different letters  indicate statistically significant differences  according to tukey’s multiple range test



discussion
during their life cycle, plants encounter a variety of exogenous and endogenous osmotic changes and have developed various strategies to sense, respond, and adapt to these stresses. exogenous osmotic stress includes drought, salt, temperature and the water potential in the stomatal apoplast, which is regulated by stomatal conductance. endogenous osmotic stimuli are caused by material accumulation or consumption, such as caryopsis development, seed maturation, and seed imbibition during germination. in recent studies, osca was identified as an osmosensor mediating hyperosmolarity-induced cytosolic calcium increases  in arabidopsis, which increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sensing of osmotic stresses by plants  <cit> .

oryza  contains the world’s most important food crop, rice, which has diversified across a broad ecological range, from deep water to upland, including seasonally dry habitats. this diversification occurred within a narrow evolutionary time scale  due to several closely spaced speciation events, constituting an almost stepwise historical genomic record  <cit> . therefore, studying the phylogenetic relationship of oscas in four oryza species and the expression levels of ososca family genes in various tissue/organs, developmental stages, and under various abiotic stresses will facilitate further research on this gene family and provide potential target genes for generation of genetically modified osmotic-stress-resistant plants.

based on the phylogenetic tree, we found that the osca genes from two oryza sativa subspecies, with the exception of osca <dig> , were clustered more closely with their orthologues from oryza glaberrima than those from oryza brachyantha, which indicated that oryza brachyantha and oryza glaberrima split long before the separation of cultivated and wild rice. furthermore, the subspecies of cultivated rice, oryza sativa l. ssp. japonica and oryza sativa l. ssp. indica, have the closest relationship, which further supported the evolutionary origins in diploid oryza. with the same aa genome species as oryza sativa, the wild rice oryza glaberrima is more closely than oryza brachyantha because it is an ff genome species  <cit> . ososca <dig>  in oryza sativa l. ssp. japonica lacks the first five exons compared with its orthologues in oryza sativa l. ssp. indica, oryza brachyantha, and oryza glaberrima, which accounts for the predicted protein structure of ososca <dig>  lacking the first three tm regions. in addition, osca <dig>  contains a single exon and obosca <dig>  is shorter than its three homologues. this leads to the absence of the first three tm regions in obosca <dig> , which are present in the homologous proteins in the other three rice species. these results suggested that osca <dig>  is the most conserved member of the osca family, and that deletions in ososca <dig>  and obosca <dig>  occurred independently during rice evolution. furthermore, we predicted that the first three tm regions may not be essential for the basic ion channel activity of oscas, but essential for osmosensor specificity.

in this study, we found that ososca genes were expressed in tissue-specific patterns, indicative of a specific role for each member of the ososca family in sensing various osmotic-related stresses by different tissues/organs. in addition, it was well known that osmotic conditions appear to control seed development in many plant species  <cit> . during caryopsis development and seed maturation after fertilisation, material accumulation and decreasing water content result in an increasing osmotic potential in endosperm cells, which may regulate the transcriptional expression of oscas. this study demonstrated that the transcription of ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig>  was in accordance with increased endogenous osmotic changes during rice caryopsis development. in contrast, osmotic potential was decreased during seed imbibition, which may lower the expression of ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig> . these results suggest that oscas play important roles during caryopsis development and seed imbibition.

in plants, circadian rhythms control stomatal conductance, transpiration, and relative water content around the guard cells, which regulates osmotic changes in the leaf  <cit> . previously, we showed that ca2+-sensing receptor  mediated the external ca2+ -induced i increase in guard cells and o-induced stomatal closure  <cit> . we further showed that i oscillations were synchronised to o oscillations through the cas/ip <dig> pathway in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in this study, we showed that the expression of ososca <dig> , ososca <dig> , and ososca <dig>  was orchestrated by the circadian clock, suggestive of their potential roles in sensing and responding to extracellular osmotic changes caused by circadian rhythms. previous extensive research showed that plants respond and adapt to drought and high-salinity stresses by inducing the expression of a number of genes  <cit> . peg, nacl, and drought stress are often interconnected and may induce similar cellular damage  <cit> , as osmotic stress is the first and primary component of salt and drought stress upon exposure of plants to high nacl concentrations and water-deficient environments  <cit> . and aba, a key plant stress-signalling hormone, is synthesised in response to various abiotic stresses and regulates the expression of numerous stress-responsive genes in plants  <cit> . in this study, we found that the expression of eight ososca genes was upregulated by at least one type of osmotic-related abiotic stress, such as peg, nacl, drought, or aba treatment; in contrast, the expression of ososca <dig>  was decreased by peg and aba treatment. we also found that ososca <dig>  and ososca <dig>  were not regulated by these four kinds of abiotic-related stress. in particular, the expression of ososca <dig>  was only showed as circadian rhythm oscillation, but not in osmotic-related abiotic stress, which indicated that ososca <dig>  plays a different role in sensing and responsing to water potential in guard cells. these results suggested that each member of the ososca family plays a distinct role in the growth and development and the responses to diverse abiotic stresses, and provided further clues for the study of the physiological function of ososcas as an osomosensor in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
osca was first characterised as an osmosensor that mediated hyperosmolality-induced i increases in arabidopsis, indicating that this multiple-member family may play pivotal roles in sensing the exogenous and endogenous osmotic changes and in regulating plant growth and development. sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that  <dig> ososcas from oryza sativa l. japonica contained a conserved duf <dig> domain and shared common structural characteristics with their homologs in oryza sativa l. ssp. indica, oryza glaberrima, and oryza brachyantha. in addition, we demonstrated that the expression of ososcas was correlated with various exogenous and endogenous osmotic changes in an organ/tissue-specific manner in rice.
