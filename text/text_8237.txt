BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses of swine  are important infectious agents that contribute to porcine respiratory disease complex . pigs infected with iav-s typically demonstrate depression, anorexia, and labored abdominal breathing  <cit> , and iav-s frequently are isolated from pigs showing acute clinical signs  <cit> . the high morbidity rate associated with iav-s, which reaches approximately 100 % among pigs kept together in the same pig pen or farm, causes heavy economic losses in the pig industry because of high medication costs and decreased weight gain  <cit> . in addition, our previous active surveillance of iav-s in clinically healthy pigs in thailand revealed that subclinical infection frequently affects pigs in the weaning and early-fattening stages on farrow-to-finish pig farms  <cit> . this finding suggests that iav-s exist either in a subclinical form or in an epizootic form that causes the typical respiratory syndrome in pigs . however, the dynamics of subclinical iav-s in pig populations are not yet well understood, largely because most iav-s surveillance is conducted passively—that is, by using samples submitted to a laboratory after outbreaks of respiratory disease.

according to serosurveillance data from canada  <cit> , seroprevalence for the h1n <dig> subtype was  <dig>  % among  <dig> sow herds and  <dig>  % among  <dig> finisher herds. in addition, an estimated  <dig>  % of the finisher herds in the united states are infected with iav-s  <cit> . serologic studies on iav-s in canada  <cit> , belgium  <cit> , france  <cit> , spain  <cit> , malaysia  <cit> , and england  <cit>  have found that “high number of pigs per farm or pen”, followed by “importation or purchase of pigs” and “proximity of the farm to other pig farms”, are the key risk factors for increased rates of seropositivity against iav-s. in addition, “way of the moving pigs on the farms” and “lack of all-in–all-out management” have been suggested as risk factors for h1n <dig> and h1n <dig> iav-s, respectively  <cit> . despite these studies, how iav-s persist in pig populations during the intervals between disease outbreaks remains unclear, because serosurveillance cannot reveal the dynamics of infection with either subclinical or epizootic iav-s.

iav-s in vietnam have not been studied thoroughly, even though vietnam is considered a high-priority target country for improvements in iav-s monitoring, given that its pig and poultry populations are large  <cit> . vietnam was the second-largest producer of pork in asia in  <dig>  <cit> , and about 85 % of the country’s total pig production comes from smallholders rearing fewer than  <dig> sows  <cit> . in addition, these smallholders often concurrently raise multiple types of livestock, including pigs and poultry—a practice considered to support the interspecies transmission of influenza viruses as well as genetic reassortment between avian and mammalian influenza viruses  <cit> . furthermore, large-scale production by commercial producers rose from 2 % to 17 % of the total pig product in the 2000s  <cit> , resulting in an increase of about  <dig> million pigs in vietnam  <cit> ; thus, industrialized production is gradually replacing traditional, small-farm production.

we have been monitoring vietnamese iav-s at the various types of pig holdings, including large- and small-scale farms and slaughterhouses, since february  <dig> and have reported subclinical infections with novel reassortant h3n <dig> and h1n <dig> iav-s and apdm <dig> viruses in vietnamese pigs from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . the reassortant h3n <dig> and h1n <dig> iav-s affected corporate, large-scale farms, whereas the apdm <dig> viruses were present on both large-scale farms and family-operated small farms. overall, most of the farms that we investigated earlier had neither of these viruses. these findings prompted us to consider that management procedures might affect the incidence of subclinical iav-s infection on pig farms in vietnam. in addition, we surmised that risk factors for subclinical infection might differ between the enzootic strains in pig populations and the apdm <dig> viruses, which were recently reintroduced into pig populations from humans  <cit> . to answer these questions, we collected information related to pig husbandry methods, including the number of pigs, biosecurity level, and type of operation, through interviews with farmers when we collected samples between february  <dig> and december  <dig> for virus isolation. we applied univariate and logistic regression analysis to the husbandry and virologic surveillance data to identify factors involved in the enzooticity of iav-s in vietnamese pigs.

methods
sample collection
we collected nasal swabs  <dig> times in total from pig farms in northern and southern vietnam from february  <dig> to december  <dig>  nasal swab samples were collected twice or three times in a year during the period. we collected a total of  <dig> nasal-swab samples from clinically healthy pigs on a total of  <dig> pig farms located in  <dig> provinces where pig farming was prevalent, comprising  <dig> provinces  in the northern region and  <dig> provinces  in the southern region. farms were recruited to include a variety of farms differing in total number of pigs reared and operation type to reflect the whole situation of vietnamese pig industry. owners’ consent was obtained upon enrolment. previous history of influenza or respiratory disease was not considered as a condition for the enrollment. the first five collection events occurred during or before february 2011; nasal swabs were collected from groups of suckling pigs, weanling pigs, fattening pigs, mature sows, and adult boars. during the remaining twelve samplings, we sampled weanling and fattening pigs only. of the  <dig> farms,  <dig> were visited more than once  and during different periods. we collected  <dig> to  <dig> nasal swabs from each farm at each visit, thus allowing us to detect at least one infected pig when the disease prevalence was  <dig>  % to 20 % at 95 % confidence  <cit> . if a small farm had fewer than  <dig> pigs, nasal swabs were collected from all available pigs.

during december  <dig>  we visited  <dig> slaughterhouses located in ho chi minh, binh duong, and long an provinces and collected  <dig> nasal swabs in total. at each slaughterhouse we collected nasal swabs from  <dig> to  <dig> finishing pigs ; samples were collected from as many pigs as possible at each slaughterhouse at each sampling time. in the same way as for the samples taken from pig farms, all of the samples from slaughterhouse pigs were collected from animals that lacked clinically evident respiratory disease.

ethical approval was not required for this study, because taking a nasal swab does not cause pain and lasting harm to a pig. informed consent was obtained from all participating pig farm/slaughter house owners.

virus isolation and characterization
nasal swab samples were collected from pigs by using flocked swabs with a plastic handle . the swab was inserted  <dig> to 10 cm from the external naris, and the nasopharynx was rubbed several times with the swab. each sample-bearing swab was placed immediately into a 15-ml tube containing 2 ml transport medium ,  <dig>  m hepes, and  <dig>  % bovine serum albumin) and kept at 4 °c. after centrifugation at 1400 × g for 5 min, the supernatant fluid was aliquoted and kept at −80 °c until use. pooled supernatant  was screened by real-time pcr using sybr premix ex taq  with primers targeting the m gene of influenza a viruses, as previously described  <cit> . when a pooled sample was positive by pcr, the nasal swabs represented in the pooled samples were individually passed over a  <dig> -μm pore-size filter  and the filtered materials was inoculated into floating mdck cells. to prepare floating mdck cells, monolayers of mdck cells were washed  <dig> times with sterile pbs to eliminate residual fetal calf serum;  <dig>  % trypsin–edta solution  was then added and the trypsinized cells were collected into maintenance mem containing penicillin , streptomycin , fungizone , gentamicin , and  <dig>  % bovine serum albumin. after centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, the cells were resuspended at a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml in maintenance mem containing  <dig>  μg/ml tpck–trypsin , and  <dig>  ml was dispensed into each nunc cell-culture tube  . a 160-μl aliquot of the original nasal swab was inoculated into the resuspended mdck cells and incubated for 4 days at 37 °c in 5 % co <dig>  when viruses were not isolated from the pcr-positive swab using floating mdck cells, the original materials were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs and/or primary cultures of porcine alveolar epithelial cells as previously described  <cit> . hemagglutination  activity was tested by using  <dig>  % red blood cells from guinea pigs or chickens as previously described  <cit> . if ha activity was not observed after the first passage, the supernatant fluids collected were inoculated into each substrate once more.

nucleotide sequences of the viruses isolated were determined by direct sequencing of pcr products as previously described  <cit>  and by next-generation sequencing  . cdna libraries for ngs were prepared by using a nebnext ultra rna library prep kit for illumina . the libraries prepared were sequenced by using a miseq reagent kit v <dig> , and the fragments obtained were mapped to the reference sequences of influenza a viruses by using genomics workbench software . the sequences obtained were used as query sequences in blast searches, then the genetic origins of each segment were determined based on the genetic lineages of the strains with the highest identity of the known lineage, such as apdm <dig>  north american triple reassortant, and human seasonal lineages and so on. the nucleotide sequences obtained in the present study have been deposited in gisaid epiful database , strain ids are available on additional file  <dig> 

statistical analysis
the age and production stage of the pigs from which the nasal swabs were collected were recorded during the visit. in addition, epidemiologic data  were collected as variables for statistical analysis by interviewing the farmers on each farm. the variables were defined as follows: farm type ; numbers of pigs ; disinfection facility ; other animals on farm ; operation type ; type of pig house ; introduction of pigs from other farms ; vaccine history ; respiratory disease histories in pigs or working staff ; and presence of livestock farms within  <dig> m.

influenza positivity was confirmed through virus isolation. the age and stage distributions of the pigs investigated were assessed by fisher’s exact test to identify the age or production group most susceptible to subclinical infection with iav-s. a farm was considered positive when at least one virus was isolated from the nasal swabs tested. differences in management procedures between influenza-positive and influenza-negative farms were assessed by using a logistic regression model in univariate analysis. iav-s positivity or negativity was set as the dependent variable, and all variables describing farm characteristics were evaluated individually in regression models; selected variables were evaluated simultaneously in multivariate analysis. independent variables were identified by calculating pearson’s correlation coefficient, then variables with a high correlation coefficient  were excluded to avoid multicollinearity. finally, variables among influenza-positive farms were analyzed to reveal whether risk factors for subclinical infection with iav-s differed among strains. all of the statistical procedures were performed in stata se version  <dig> .

RESULTS
the  <dig> farms analyzed comprised  <dig> corporate farms,  <dig> family-operated farms , and  <dig> farms for which no information regarding farm type was obtained. the largest farm had  <dig>  pigs, and the smallest farm had  <dig> pigs ;  <dig> farms did not report the number of pigs. among the  <dig> farms were  <dig> farrow-to-finish farms that maintained sows and fed the offspring until they reached market weight,  <dig> wean-to-finish farms that purchased weanling piglets and raised them to finishing, and  <dig> farrow-to-wean farms from which piglets were sold after they were weaned; the remaining  <dig> farms used a combination of these three operation types. vaccines against swine influenza were not available in vietnam; the most common vaccines used at the farms were for classic swine fever , foot-and-mouth disease , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome . dogs and poultry  were the other animals most commonly kept on pig farms . in addition,  <dig> farms reported respiratory symptoms in pigs, represented by coughing and nasal discharge, within the 6 months before our sampling;  <dig> of these  <dig> farms reported concurrent respiratory symptoms in working staff.

the number of pigs slaughtered daily ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  at the  <dig> slaughterhouses investigated. finishing pigs were slaughtered within  <dig> to 48 h after arriving at a slaughterhouse from a pig farm. of the  <dig> slaughterhouses,  <dig> processed pigs only; both pigs and cattle were killed at the remaining  <dig> slaughterhouses.

a total of  <dig> iav-s— <dig> apdm <dig>   <dig> h1n <dig>  and  <dig> h3n <dig> subtype—were isolated from the  <dig> nasal swabs collected from clinically healthy pigs at pig farms . no viruses were isolated from the  <dig> nasal swabs collected at slaughterhouses. virus isolation rates differed significantly between production stages :  <dig>  % of the viruses were isolated from weanling pigs compared with  <dig>  % from fattening pigs . pigs from which iav-s were isolated ranged in age from 3 weeks to  <dig>  months ; no viruses were isolated from suckling pigs younger than 3 weeks or older than 6 months, including finishing pigs, sows, and boars.table  <dig> specimen collection and iav-s isolated from different pig production stages and age groups in vietnam

the subsequent regression multivariate analysis showed that the factor “total number of pigs” on the pig farm was significantly associated with subclinical infection with iav-s . specifically, the likelihood of iav-s positivity was  <dig>  times higher for farms with  <dig> pigs or more than for those with fewer than  <dig> pigs  . the four variables included in the regression analysis—“type of operation”, “total number of pigs”, “type of pig house”, and “other animals on farm”—were selected on the basis of the pearson correlation analysis . because “total number of pigs” was highly associated with “corporate farms”, “shower-in facility for humans”, and “disinfection facility for vehicles”, those three variables were excluded from the multivariate model. in addition the presence of other animals was negatively associated with the total number of pigs . we therefore could not rule out the possibility that the presence of other animals were confounded with the total number of pigs. however, because “other animals on farm” had been considered as a risk factor for iav-s infection in other previous study  <cit> , we used this variate in the multivariate analysis. as the result, it did not turn out that it has effect on the iav-s positivity in our multivariate analysis .table  <dig> logistic estimates for iav-s positivity according to selected variables

all of the genetic origins of each segment of the isolates in this study showed more than 97 % identities with strains whose genetic origins had been defined in previous studies. all of the segments of the h1n <dig> isolates were derived from apdm <dig> viruses . in contrast, the h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> iav-s isolated in this study were reassortants that had at least two genes derived from enzootic strains in the vietnamese pig population   <cit> . in particular,  <dig> iav-s  out of  <dig> h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> isolates were reassortants between endemic strains and apdm <dig> viruses . to examine whether the risk factors for iav-s subclinical infection differed among strains, we compared management practices between apdm09-positive farms and farms positive for endemic iav-s. one corporate farm where both apdm <dig> virus and an enzootic strain were isolated was included as being both apdm09v-positive and enzootic-positive . this comparison revealed that two variables—“total number of pigs” and “other animals on farm”—differed significantly between the two kinds of farms  . that is, farms with  <dig>  pigs or more had a significantly higher risk of infection by endemic strains infection than did the farms where apdm <dig> viruses were isolated. no enzootic strains were isolated from family-operated farms with fewer than  <dig> pigs, whereas apdm <dig> viruses were isolated from  <dig> family-operated farms. all  <dig> farms from which apdm <dig> viruses were isolated were rearing other animals in addition to pigs. in contrast, the  <dig> farms, out of  <dig> farms positive for enzootic iav-s, were raising only pigs.fig.  <dig> gene constellations of the iav-s identified. gene segments derived from apdm <dig> viruses are represented as gray squares; those from enzootic strains are represented as stippled , black , and white  squares. pb <dig>  polymerase gene 2; pb <dig>  polymerase gene 1; pa, polymerase gene a; ha, hemagglutinin gene; np, nucleoprotein gene; na, neuraminidase gene; m, matrix gene; and ns, non-structural gene. the numbers of the isolates in each genotype are indicated in the rightmost column. asterisks indicate the novel genotypes found in this study

discussion
to date, few studies  have addressed the subclinical forms of iav-s, because the presence of iav-s on a farm has been demonstrated mainly through passive or serologic surveillance efforts. our active virologic monitoring indicates that iav-s have spread subclinically in the vietnamese pig population. one important finding of our study is that, in vietnam, iav-s are more prevalent on farms with  <dig> pigs or more than on smaller farms. modern industrialized farms have emerged in vietnam since  <dig> and have gradually replaced the traditional, small, family-run farms  <cit> , as has occurred in the united states and in european countries over the last several decades  <cit> . rearing a large number of pigs on a farm is recognized as one of the most influential risk factors for iav-s seropositivity in sows and fattening pigs  <cit> . our current results coincide with these previous findings, although the earlier serologic studies did not differentiate between subclinical infections and typical, clinical infections in pigs  <cit> . housing large numbers of susceptible pigs closely together likely provides appropriate conditions for iav-s to circulate continuously in the pig population on a farm  <cit> . in addition, the intensification of husbandry practices associated with large-scale farms might increase the frequency of movement of workers and vehicles to and within a farm, thus increasing the risk of pathogen transmission  <cit> .

we isolated apdm <dig> viruses from both corporate and family-run farms. this result is consistent with other reports, such as those of the large, corporate farms in the united states  <cit>  and canada  <cit> , as well as small family-operated farms in peru  <cit>  and canada  <cit> . according to the genetic analysis, vietnamese h1n <dig> isolates in this study showed the high identity with apdm <dig> viruses, reflecting viral transmission from humans to pigs, as has been seen in many other countries . such human-to-pig transmission of apdm <dig> viruses increases global public health concerns, because reassortment with enzootic iav-s could generate influenza a viruses with novel gene combinations in the pig population. pigs are highly susceptible to apdm <dig> viruses  <cit> , and our data suggest that efforts to prevent the introduction of these strains into farms have not been effective. according to the ncbi influenza virus resource, apdm <dig> viruses had been isolated from pigs in  <dig> countries as of  <dig>  <cit> . unsurprisingly, many novel reassortants between apdm <dig> viruses and the enzootic iav-s have arisen in many countries and regions . one such example with public health implications is a novel reassortant h3n2v, which is a triple-reassortant h3n <dig> iav-s that contains an m gene from an apdm <dig> virus. the h3n2v isolate was first identified from human in the united states in july  <dig>  and more than  <dig> human cases have been reported, although human-to-human transmission is limited  <cit> .

according to the results of blast searches, most of the h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> iav-s that we isolated were reassortants between enzootic strains in vietnamese pigs and apdm <dig> viruses. in particular, 97 % of these reassortants  were isolated from farms with  <dig>  pigs or more. to our knowledge, eight out of  <dig> genotypes of h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> subtypes are never reported outside vietnam  . these findings suggests that large-scale farms provide an environment that is more conducive than that of small-scale farms for iav-s to exchange their gene segments with each other and with other viruses. subclinical infections likely spread more slowly than does the epidemic form that leads to acute respiratory disease on a farm  <cit> . if so, subclinical infections with iav-s warrant increased attention to prevent the generation of novel viruses, because prolonged virus circulation would increase the opportunity for reassortment events. we recently reported that numerous iav-s with various gene constellations arose in weanling pigs co-infected with h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> iav-s on a large, corporate farm  <cit> . in particular, plaque purification assays of nasal swabs revealed that at least  <dig> different constellations of gene segments emerged within a single co-infected pig that lacked clinical signs.

young pigs of the weaning and early-fattening stages appear to play an important role in the interepizootic survival of iav-s. high virus-isolation rates from clinically healthy pigs have been obtained from those aged  <dig> to 12 weeks in thailand  <cit> , 12 weeks in japan  <cit> , and  <dig> to 12 weeks in the current study. these ages coincide with the waning of maternal antibodies in piglets; maternal antibodies against iav-s gradually decline through 10 weeks of age  <cit> . continuous production of susceptible piglets on large-scale farms might provide a chain of naïve hosts to maintain subclinical infection with iav-s. in fact, recurrent iav-s infections in young pigs on large commercial farms have been reported. for example, on a 300-sow farrow-to-finish swine farm in spain, a specific iav-s repeatedly affected a group of pigs over the course of 6 months, and this particular strain was the isolate most frequently found when the pigs were tested as 3- and 7-week-olds  <cit> . interestingly, three of the pigs examined were infected with the same subtype strain twice on two different occasions during the 6-month period. our previous active surveillance in thailand alternately isolated h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> iav-s from weanling pigs  at a 17-month interval  <cit> . in addition to young pigs, sows appear to be frequently infected with iav-s, perhaps because they typically are the only group with any longevity  on a farm; the likelihood of infection with a pathogen increases with time  <cit> . our previous study and those of others have demonstrated an increased seropositivity rate against iav-s in sows at farrow-to-finish farms  <cit> . however, we did not isolate any iav-s from clinically healthy sows in our current study or during our previous active surveillance in thailand and vietnam  <cit> . therefore, how sows are involved in asymptomatic circulation of iav-s on pig farms remains unclear.

subclinical infection with iav-s is currently not considered to have a pronounced negative effect on growth performance on pig farms. however, er et al.  <cit>  recently demonstrated that subclinical infection of pigs on norwegian farms with apdm <dig> viruses reduced both feed conversion efficiency and average daily growth. interestingly, the adverse effect lasted longer than the viral shedding period . specifically, pigs infected when they weighed  <dig> to 60 kg required  <dig>  kg more feed to reach 100 kg bodyweight than did unexposed pigs. consequently, the infected pigs took longer to reach market weight  <cit> . although our current investigation did not directly address such adverse effects of subclinical infection in vietnamese pigs, similar effects might be presumed.

in contrast to the situation on farms from which we isolated enzootic strains, the farms that harbored apdm <dig> viruses were more likely to have kept animals other than pigs. having mammalian pets on a farm was a risk factor for iav-s seropositivity on malaysian pig farms  <cit> . however, whether these other animals serve as “couriers” for spreading influenza a viruses within a farm is unclear, although apdm <dig> viruses have a wide host range among mammals  <cit> , including dogs  <cit>  and cats  <cit> . in addition, we could not rule out the possibility that ‘presence of other animals’ is confounded with the number of pigs as concerned in the univariate analysis. further study would be needed to understand a role of the presence of other animals in pig farms.

introduction of pigs from outside a farm is another important risk factor for seropositivity against iav-s in pigs  <cit> . many outbreaks of swine influenza are clearly related to the introduction of infected pigs  <cit> . however, our analysis failed to reveal a significant relationship between subclinical infection with iav-s and the introduction of pigs, although  <dig> of the  <dig> iav-s-positive farms had obtained gilts or weanling pigs from external sources. this discrepancy may be explained in part by the fact that 32 %  of the farms had not recorded their purchase histories; these missing values consequently were excluded from our statistical analysis. evaluating the effect of the introduction of pigs on subclinical infection with iav-s on pig farms merits increased attention. interestingly, 90 % of iav-s positive farms  had open- or semi-open-sided houses although it did not show significant p value compared with the positive farms having windowless pig houses, suggesting that the type of pig house may be worthy of attention in future studies. although involvement of seasonality, presence of other respiratory pathogens, and humidity or temperature of barns, that were considered as risk factors for the iav-s occurrence by previous studies  <cit> , was unable to be evaluated in this study, those could be risk factors even in subclinical infections of iav-s in pig farms and further study on those variables would provide useful information.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings demonstrate the asymptomatic circulation of iav-s in the vietnamese pig population. raising a large number of pigs on a farm has the strongest impact on the incidence of subclinical iav-s infection, although not all the large-scale farms we evaluated suffered from subclinical iav-s infection. in fact,  <dig> of the  <dig> large, corporate farms in our surveillance yielded no iav-s, raising the possibility that risk factor for subclinical infection other than a large number of pigs exist within this type of farm. further active surveillance to define risk factors for subclinical infection with iav-s in vietnam would provide early detection of a virus with pandemic potential and would also mitigate economic losses in the pig industry.
