BACKGROUND
many proteins co-evolve as a result of protein-protein interaction, and maintain or diversify their functions. this interaction is often complicated, so elucidation of the co-evolutionary process is difficult in many cases. the hatching enzyme of teleost species is secreted by the embryo to digest the egg envelope that surrounds the embryo and protects it from environmental, chemical, and mechanical stresses  <cit> . considering that hatching enzyme would have evolved while maintaining the ability to digest the egg envelope, the hatching enzyme-egg envelope protein pair is a good model system for understanding molecular co-evolution of a protease and its substrate.

both egg envelope protein and hatching enzyme have been studied in the model fish medaka . the egg envelope consists of thick inner layers and a thin outer layer. the inner layers are composed of two groups of subunit proteins called zi- <dig>  and zi- <dig>  <cit> , which are classified into vertebrate-common egg envelope protein groups zpb and zpc, respectively  <cit> . zi- <dig>  are heterogeneous glycoproteins derived from the precursors choriogenin h and h minor. zi- <dig> is a homogenous glycoprotein derived from the precursor choriogenin l  <cit> . both zi- <dig>  and zi- <dig> have a zona pellucida  domain consisting of about  <dig> amino acids, with eight conserved cysteine residues  <cit> . additional characteristics of zi- <dig>  include a pro-xaa-yaa repeat region and a trefoil domain upstream of the zp domain.

hatching enzyme is a member of the astacin metallo-protease family. medaka possesses two types of hatching enzymes, high choriolytic enzyme  and low choriolytic enzyme   <cit> . at hatching, both enzymes simultaneously act on the egg envelope and completely solubilize its inner layers  <cit> . the thin filamentous outer layer remains undigested and is broken by embryo movement. studies have shown that the molecular mechanism of the enzymes is as follows: hce swells the envelope by cleaving the n-terminal region of egg envelope proteins, especially the pro-xaa-yaa repeat region on zi- <dig> , into small pieces  <cit> . lce solubilizes the hce-swollen envelope by cleaving only two sites, the n-terminal of the zp domain of zi- <dig>  and the middle of the zp domain of zi- <dig>   <cit> . because zp domains assemble each other to form a higher-order architecture as the egg envelope  <cit> , cleavage of the middle of the zp domain by lce may change the higher-order structure of the egg envelope and lead to its complete digestion  <cit> . indeed, our group recently uncovered the importance of the middle region of the zp domain  for solubilization, as demonstrated by the following findings  <cit> : the nine-spined stickleback possessed two types of lce, lceα and lceβ, formed by gene duplication. lceα cleaved the n-zpd site but not the mid-zpd site, while lceβ cleaved only the mid-zpd site but not the n-zpd site. when only the n-zpd site was cleaved by lceα, the egg envelope was not solubilized, but remained swollen. the swollen egg envelope was solubilized only after the mid-zpd site was cleaved by lceβ. thus, the mid-zpd region is a key site for egg envelope solubilization.

comparative studies have shown that the egg envelope digestion mechanism is conserved between medaka and fundulus species. fundulus possesses two isoforms of hce, called fhce <dig> and fhce <dig>  both of which swell the egg envelope  <cit> . fundulus lce then solubilizes the swollen envelope completely  <cit> . the positions of cleavage sites for fundulus hce  and lce  are similar to those of medaka hce  and lce   <cit> .

recently, we identified both cross-species similarities and differences in the modes of action of hatching enzymes from medaka and fundulus. when incubated with fundulus hatching liquid containing both hces and lce, the medaka egg envelope was swollen, but not solubilized  <cit> . in addition, we found that isolated fundulus hces swelled the medaka egg envelope, but that isolated fundulus lce did not digest the swollen medaka egg envelope. therefore, mode of action of hce is common to both fundulus and medaka, but the action of lce in egg envelope digestion is substrate-specific.

in the present study, we identified the amino acid residues of lce responsible for conferring the specificity in egg envelope digestion, and discuss a molecular co-evolutionary pathway for hatching enzyme and egg envelope protein in a teleostean lineage, based on data obtained from the reconstruction and activities of probable ancestral forms of teleostean lces.

RESULTS
species specificity of hatching enzyme from medaka and fundulus
as shown in figures 1a and 1d, hce from medaka o. latipes  and fundulus heteroclitus  swelled the egg envelope of both species. activities of hce in the cross-species or xenogenic combinations were somewhat lower , but were sufficient to swell the egg envelope. thus, the action of hce showed low substrate specificity in both medaka and fundulus.

in contrast to hce, lce could only digest the swollen envelope of the species from which it originated . medaka lce  sharply increased solubilization of the swollen medaka egg envelope with incubation time, whereas mlce only slightly solubilized that of fundulus . similarly, fundulus lce  efficiently solubilized the swollen envelope of fundulus, but not that of medaka . these results suggested that lce activity is substrate-specific in medaka and fundulus.

identification of key amino acid residues responsible for the species-specificity of lce activity
 egg envelope protein
species-specific egg envelope digestion in fundulus or medaka would be established by amino acid changes both in egg envelope protein and in hatching enzyme lce. we first focused on the key lce cleavage sites in the envelope protein, the mid-zpd region. we identified six substitutions in  <dig> amino acid residues of the mid-zpd regions of both fundulus and medaka, and synthetic peptides were then designed from the sequences around the mid-zpd cleavage site .

flce cleaved the fundulus mid-zpd peptide , but not the medaka peptide  , confirming the species-specificity of egg envelope digestion. mlce digested the mid-zpd peptides from both fundulus and medaka , suggesting that the species specificity of mlce does not depend on the peptide sequence around the cleavage site. because egg envelope has an insoluble macro-molecular structure, the species specificity of mlce for cleavage of the intact swollen egg envelope may be due to the enzyme-to-substrate interaction in a higher-ordered conformation.

next, we constructed mutant peptides of the mid-zpd region whose residue were substituted with either fundulus- ormedaka-type residues . as shown in figure 2a, flce only cleaved peptides  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  all of which possess the common residue l at the p <dig> site  <cit> . l to p substitution at the p <dig> site of the fundulus peptide significantly reduced the activity of flce. in contrast, p to l substitution at the corresponding site of the medaka peptide enabled flce activity. these results suggested that the flce-specific digestion could be explained by the presence of l at the p <dig> site in the flce-cleavage site on the substrate.

 hatching enzyme
it is reasonable to hypothesize that, in addition to the p <dig> site of the substrate, the species-specific digestion of flce depends on the structure of its active site cleft, where flce interacts directly with the cleavage site on the egg envelope. the crystal structure of mlce revealed that  <dig> residues faced the active site cleft. the residues are shown in figure 3a. amongst these residues,  <dig> substitutions were observed in mlce or flce. to transform the active site cleft from fundulus-type into medaka-type, we first introduced  <dig> amino acid mutations into flce, and generated recombinant mutant flce  named flce_mu <dig> . flce_mu <dig> solubilized the swollen medaka egg envelope. furthermore, the efficiency of flce_mu <dig> towards the medaka mid-zpd peptide was not significantly different from that of recombinant mlce  . therefore, we concluded that the species specificity of flce was caused by some of the  <dig> amino acid substitutions in the active site cleft.

to identify the most important mutations for species specificity, we reduced the number of mutations introduced into flce in a stepwise manner.

1) first, we focused on substitutions between amino acids with distinctly different properties, such as negative, positive, uncharged polar, and/or non-polar amino acids. among the  <dig> substitutions,  <dig> sites showed such differences. these  <dig> residues in flce were substituted with medaka-type residues and named flce_mu <dig> . flce_mu <dig> completely digested the swollen medaka egg envelope . in addition, flce_mu <dig> had sufficient activity to cleave the medaka mid-zpd peptide, and its km value was similar to that of rmlce . therefore, these  <dig> substitutions were sufficient to cause the flce-specific lce activity.

2) the next strategy was as follows: two of the  <dig> mutations were returned to fundulus-types, and named flce_mu <dig>  if the returned residue was an important site, the peptide cleavage activity of these mutant rflces would decrease, and if not, the activity would not change. we generated five mutant rflces, named flce_mu8a to 8e, whose returned sites are shown in figure 3a. only flce_mu8d did not change the peptide cleavage activity . these observations suggested that some of the eight mutations  were important for the species specificity of flce.

3) similar to the above strategy, one of the eight mutations was next returned to the fundulus-type residue and named flce_mu8d. eight separate mutant rflces were generated, which were named flce_mu8d_“returned site”. as shown in figure 4c, four of these eight mutant rflces had decreased peptide cleavage activity, suggesting that f74k, p91f, k135h, and r183t were important substitutions for flce activity and species specificity.

4) finally, we introduced these four mutations into flce and generated recombinant flce_mu <dig> . as shown in figure 4d, flce_mu <dig> completely solubilized the swollen medaka egg envelope, and its peptide cleavage activity was similar to that of rmlce . therefore, the four residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were determined to be essential for the species specificity of flce.

to determine the contribution of the four flce sites to egg envelope digestion, we further individually returned one of the four sites of flce_mu <dig> to the fundulus type, generating four new mutant rflces, named flce_mu4_“returned site”. all the mutant rflces decreased the peptide-cleaving activity . flce_mu4_k74f and flce_mu4_t183r lost activity and, in addition, did not solubilize the swollen medaka egg envelope. the km values of flce_mu4_k74f and flce_mu4_t183r toward the medaka peptide increased by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold compared with that of flce_mu <dig>  respectively, suggesting that the affinity of the mutant rflces for the substrate was reduced due to the mutation at either position  <dig> or  <dig>  also, in terms of the egg envelope-solubilizing activity, residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> appear to play a critical role in the species specificity of flce.

on the other hand, flce_mu4_f91p partially digested the swollen medaka egg envelope , and its km value was similar to that of rmlce . although flce_mu4_h135k had the lowest activity toward the medaka mid-zpd peptide among the four mutants, it completely solubilized the swollen medaka egg envelope. when positions  <dig> and  <dig> on rflce were substituted to the medaka types, mutant rflce  could not solubilize the swollen medaka egg envelope. this result suggested that positions  <dig> and  <dig> are also necessary for the complete egg envelope solubilization. the cleavage of mid-zpd may be dependent on more complicated enzyme-substrate interaction, in addition to recognition of primary sequence of the cleavage site. we conclude that these four residues are required for flce to maintain suitable activity towards the cleavage site peptide and to digest the swollen medaka egg envelope.

substrate preference of lces
we further examined the preference of lces towards the p <dig> site using  <dig> medaka mid-zpd peptide mutants. the activity of rflce in cleaving the peptide bond between d and s, such as evqpxd↓splsi, was monitored. the minor activities of rflce at other cleavage sites, such as evqpn↓dsplsi and evqpd↓dsplsi, were not further investigated in the present study. rflce cleaved five kinds of peptides, whose p <dig> site residues were l, f, m, y, or q . on the other hand, rmlce cleaved the majority of the peptides, and its activity was higher than that towards wild-type mid-zpd peptide with p at the p <dig> site . therefore, we determined that rmlce had a broader p <dig> site preference than rflce. rflce preferentially cleaved the peptides with large hydrophobic residues at the p <dig> site. another characteristic difference was in the efficiency of the peptide cleavage. the activity of mlce was about  <dig> times greater than that of flce. thus, mlce and flce are different not only in substrate preference, but also in peptide cleavage efficiency.

next, we evaluated the p <dig> site preference of lce by introducing four mutations at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that are important for the species specificity of lce. when medaka-type residues were introduced into fundulus flce , its activity was similar to that of medaka rmlce . when fundulus-type residues were introduced into medaka mlce , its activity was altered to that of the fundulus type . therefore, we confirmed that the p <dig> site preference of lces was determined by the four amino acid residues in lce.

a co-evolutionary pathway for hatching enzyme and egg envelope protein
both genes for hatching enzymes and egg envelope proteins were cloned from various euteleostean species . we deduced the ancestral sequences using paml. figure  <dig> illustrates the order of changes in amino acids introducing species-specific egg envelope digestion during the evolution of teleostean fishes. the p <dig> site of the mid-zpd site in egg envelope protein was predicted to have been occupied by l in the ancestral euteleostean species. these residues were well conserved in most of the euteleostean sequences investigated in this study. the only observed difference occurred during the evolution into oryziinae, where there was a substitution to v or p.

the ancestral euteleostean lce was predicted to have had 74 f, 91 f, 135y, and 183r in its active site cleft. these essential residues were well conserved prior to atherinomorpha. the ancestor of atherinomorpha was characterized by a single substitution at position  <dig>  later, another substitution occurred at position  <dig> in the ancestor of beloniformes. finally, three further substitutions occurred in the ancestor of oryziinae. these observations suggested that substitutions of the four essential residues in hatching enzyme lce occurred prior to substitutions in the cleavage site on egg envelope protein.

activity of ancestral recombinant lce
finally, we generated recombinant ancestral lces based on the predicted ancestral sequences  and examined their p <dig> site preference . the ancestral lce of neoteleostei  had strong p <dig> site preference, similar to that of flce. however, the p <dig> site preference of ancestral lce of acanthomorpha  was less stringent, and the ancestral lce of acanthopterygii  had cleavage activity towards various substrates. again, in the ancestor of beloniformes , high p <dig> site preference was revived, but was dramatically altered in the ancestor of oryziinae, resulting in broader substrate preference. in summary, the mlce-like activity had been established in the ancestor of oryziinae, and this ancestral lce  acquired the ability to cleave the peptide containing p at the p <dig> site. therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the acquisition of this new ability would permit the substitution to p at the p <dig> site of the ancestor of the medaka egg envelope protein.

discussion
the present work demonstrated the molecular basis of species-specific egg envelope digestion by fundulus hatching enzyme flce toward medaka egg envelope. the species specificity of flce depended on both the p <dig> site in the lce-cleavage site on the egg envelope protein, and four sites in the active site cleft of lce . generation of mutant recombinant enzymes suggested that positions  <dig> and  <dig> were indispensable for lce activity. we further compared these residues among euteleosts . in most euteleosts, the residues at position  <dig> were hydrophobic; only medaka lce contained a basic residue at this position. the residue at position  <dig> was well conserved, and was found to be r in most teleosts. however, the residue was occupied by s or t in beloniform lces, including medaka. the residue at position  <dig>  which is the third important site for species specificity, has been substituted to p in fundulus lce . the site with the lowest contribution to specificity  was substituted to a basic residue in fundulus  and medaka  .

we next examined how these substitutions were introduced into lce during evolution, changing its specificity. we analyzed ancestral lces by reconstructing the proteins and examining their activities. as shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of the ancestral lce of beloniformes  had a high p <dig> site preference. in the ancestor of oryziinae, three substitutions  occurred in lce, introducing a lower p <dig> site preference and high specific activity into lce. the substitution from f  to k  at position  <dig> required a two-step nucleotide substitution. this two-step process was predicted by paml to be a substitution from f  to i , and then to k . such substitutions in lce tolerated the substitution of v into the lce cleavage site of the egg envelope, and then the substitution to p occurred during the evolution of oryziinae.

we compared the species specificity of lce in egg envelope digestion among several pairs of fishes. three pairs  showed species-specificity, while two  did not. the results suggested that the pairs within genus oryzias and those within other euteleosts showed no species specificity, except the pair between three- and nine-spined sticklebacks, while those between oryzias species and other euteleosts showed species specificity. therefore, the manner of the establishment of the lce species specificity found in fundulus and medaka seems to be applicable to the other fish pairs, except the three- and nine-spined stickleback pair. as we only examined a few pairs of fishes, we cannot rule out the possibility that the lce species specificity arose independently in different pairs of fishes in each co-evolutionary pathway.

finally, we illustrated how amino acid substitutions introduced species specificity into lce of fundulus and medaka during evolution. as summarized in figure  <dig>  a co-evolutionary process to establish species-specific egg envelope digestion was initiated by substitution in lce . substitutions occurring in the pathway to oryziinae lowered the p <dig> site preference and, later, allowed further substitutions in the substrate. indeed, such substitutions in the substrate occurred during the evolution into oryziinae .

the substitution in the substrate established the species specificity of flce. flce maintained the ancestral activity with high substrate specificity and was unable to digest medaka egg envelope . further substitutions in the enzyme and/or substrate conferred higher specificity on the interaction between enzyme and substrate, and thus mlce could not digest fundulus envelope . in such a manner, the strict species specificity was established in fundulus and medaka . determination of the substitution sites responsible for species specificity of medaka enzyme is in progress.

it is generally accepted that strategies such as mutation and subsequent production of a recombinant mutant protein, followed by the evaluation of its function, are required to understand the evolution of protein function at the molecular level  <cit> . at present, such strategies have been extended to studies on reconstructed probable ancestors of the protein. one example is a study on hormone-receptor complexes, in which glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors switched their ligand preference following two amino acid substitutions  <cit> . another study showed that several sites are important for recognition of sugar by conger eel galectins  <cit> . the former study suggested that several amino acid substitutions are required for switching the ligand preference or specificity, possibly accompanied with some conformational change of the 3d structure of the protein itself  <cit> . in the present study we demonstrated that, in the hatching enzyme lce-egg envelope protein pair, four substitutions in the lces allowed one amino acid substitution at the lce-cleavage site on the substrate, egg envelope, during evolution. interestingly, all four substitutions were located at the edge of the active site cleft, but not within the active site cleft itself, where some amino acid side chains might interact directly with those of the substrate around the cleavage site. these substitutions are likely to result in minor but not drastic changes in substrate specificity, suggesting that the enzyme activities have gradually been changed during evolution. a similar study reported that the substitutions responsible for environmental adaptation of fish lactate dehydrogenase are located outside of the active site cleft, and induced structural changes of the active site cleft  <cit> .

in experiments to reconstruct ancestral lce, ancneotlce showed strong p <dig> site preference. during evolution, the p <dig> site preference became less stringent in ancacmolce, and then stronger again in ancbelolce, then lower in ancoryzlce, i.e., p <dig> site preference seems to have fluctuated. these results imply that the enzyme has been continually changing during evolution while still maintaining its function in cleavage of the mid-zpd site. when the substrate mutation fit with a change of enzyme specificity, the substrate mutation would be fixed, and then a new substrate-enzyme pair would be generated during later co-evolution. therefore, the co-evolution of proteins is dependent on the evolution of protein-protein interaction, although this can sometimes be very complicated. the present study provides a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms involved in protein-protein co-evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides a molecular mechanism of co-evolution of a protease and its substrate using the interaction of hatching enzyme with egg envelope protein as a model. four substitutions in lce and a single substitution within egg envelope protein observed in medaka and fundulus were responsible for the species-specific egg envelope digestion. we further observed how these residues were changed during the evolution of teleosts, and suggested that substitutions of the four essential residues on lce occurred prior to substitutions in the cleavage site of egg envelope protein. the activities of predicted ancestral recombinant proteins were consistent with these proposed changes. finally, we proposed a model for the protease-substrate co-evolution, whereby the evolutionary process leading to the species-specific action of lce was initiated by amino acid substitutions in lce, resulting in altered substrate specificity, which later allowed an amino acid substitution in the lce-cleavage site of the egg envelope.
