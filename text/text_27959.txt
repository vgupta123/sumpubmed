BACKGROUND
non-typhoidal salmonellae are major zoonotic pathogens that commonly cause salmonellosis outbreaks. globally, salmonellosis caused by non-typhoidal salmonellae generally results in about  <dig>  billion cases of acute gastroenteritis and  <dig> million deaths annually  <cit> . in the united states, salmonellae cause an estimated  <dig>  million cases of salmonellosis and over  <dig> deaths annually  <cit> . multi-drug resistant  salmonella, the global spread of which is mediated by international food trade and travel, is a global public health issue  <cit> . often, clonal spread of mdr strains has been observed in particular serovars  <cit> . in most instances, resistance genes often associated with integrons and/or transposons are clustered within antimicrobial resistance islands that can be horizontally transferred by conjugative or mobilization plasmids  <cit> .

in serogroup c <dig>  s. bareilly and s. braenderup are closely related according to molecular analysis  <cit> . both serovars have been highly susceptible to antimicrobials since  <dig>  <cit>  and are frequently isolated from feces of people with food-borne salmonellosis all over the world  <cit> . however, prevalence of both serovars differs between hosts and regions. in denmark, s. bareilly was isolated from diverse sources, including humans, animals and animal feed, while s. braenderup was only found in humans  <cit> . in a study of a broiler-raising plant in the usa, s. bareilly was often found in broilers and finished feed; however, s. braenderup was only observed in hatcheries  <cit> . in addition, s. braenderup was commonly isolated from cattle and turtles in sweden  <cit> , pigs  <cit>  and chicken egg shells  <cit>  in usa. these findings imply that animal reservoirs may be important sources of both serovars in human disease.

in this study, prevalent serogroups and serovars were determined for  <dig>  salmonella isolates collected from  <dig> and  <dig> in taiwan. because of the genetic similarity between s. bareilly and s. braenderup  <cit> , the two serovars were compared with respect to antimicrobial resistance, resistance genes, pfge and plasmid profiles. both serovars disseminated clonally and varied in antimicrobial resistance patterns.

RESULTS
prevalent serogroups and serovars
between  <dig> and  <dig>  over 95% of  <dig>  salmonella isolates belonged to serogroups b, c <dig>  c2-c <dig>  d <dig> and e <dig> . prevalence differed between serogroups and across time within serogroups: prevalence decreased in serogroups b  and c <dig>  and increased in serogroups c2-c <dig>  and d <dig>  over the study period. such changes were associated with the prevalence of major serovars in each serogroup and were due to only one or two main predominant serovars in each serogroup, except serogroup c <dig> with four prevalent serovars . the top four serovars were s. enteritidis  of serogroup d <dig>  s. typhimurium  and s. stanley  of serogroup b, and s. newport of serogroup c <dig> . in contrast to the decrease in prevalence of s. typhimurium from  <dig> to  <dig>  a gradual increase in prevalence was observed in s. enteritidis.

prevalence of serogroup c <dig> serovars
s. braenderup, s. choleraesuis, s. bareilly and s. virchow were the predominant serovars in serogroup c <dig> and consisted of  <dig> - 84% of total serogroup c <dig> isolates from  <dig> to  <dig> . other serovars, including s. infantis, s. potsdam, s. mbandaka, and s. montevideo, were occasionally isolated with prevalence less than 1% for each serovar. over the study period, the prevalence of s. choleraesuis declined dramatically, and s. braenderup prevalence declined mildly. in contrast, the prevalence of s. bareilly and other serovars gradually increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  since s. braenderup and s. bareilly were the two main serogroup c <dig> serovars in 2006- <dig> and differed in prevalence trends,  <dig> s. braenderup and  <dig> s. bareilly isolates were analyzed for their antimicrobial resistance profiles and genetic characteristics.

age distribution of patients
patients infected with s. braenderup and s. bareilly were separated into four age groups. although, both serovars were found primarily to infect children , s. bareilly was isolated far more frequently from the elderly   . however, s. braenderup was predominantly isolated from children .

pfge phylogenetic analysis
the clustering analysis of xbai-digested pfge patterns demonstrated genetic differences between s. braenderup and s. bareilly and within each serovar . in s. braenderup, all isolates were separated into  <dig> clusters  at s =  <dig> . most isolates belonged to cluster i, which was further separated into two subgroups  at s =  <dig>  . in cluster a,  <dig> isolates were separated into  <dig> pfge patterns, and  <dig> %  of the isolates were from northern taiwan . in cluster b,  <dig> isolates were grouped into  <dig> pfge patterns, and 72%  of the isolates were from southern taiwan . s. bareilly isolates were highly genetically homogenous and shared more than 90% pattern similarity .

antimicrobial resistance profiles
among six traditional antibiotics tested, s. braenderup and s. bareilly isolates were almost all susceptible to chloramphenicol  and kanamycin  and differed significantly in resistance to ampicillin , nalidixic acid , streptomycin , and tetracycline  . additionally, nine resistance patterns were determined, ranging from susceptibility to all antimicrobials to resistance to four antimicrobials. in s. braenderup,  <dig> resistance patterns  were found, and significant differences were observed between cluster a  and b  for amp , str  and tet . in addition, most isolates in cluster a were mdr  while most isolates in cluster b were susceptible . in cluster a, pattern r <dig>  was the predominant and was found in four genotypes . in s. bareilly, most isolates were either susceptible  or resistant to one  or two  antimicrobials. nal resistant isolates were found in s. bareilly  but not in s. braenderup. since there were susceptible to levofloxacin  and moxifloxacin , nal resistance may result from a mutation in the gyra gene, which encodes a subunit of the enzyme dna gyrase.

characterization of mdr plasmids
the prevalence of plasmid profile determined by plasmid number and size differed between these two serovars. most s. braenderup isolates  carried plasmids, while few s. bareilly isolates  did . plasmids larger than ca. <dig> kb were only found in resistance isolates of cluster a with the r <dig> to r <dig> patterns. cluster b s. braenderup isolates and s. bareilly isolates carried smaller plasmids with the size smaller than  <dig>  kb or lacked plasmids. larger plasmids were further identified as r plasmids by analysis of the antimicrobial resistance profiles of e. coli pir <dig> transformants, and assigned to type  <dig> and  <dig> based on hindiii-restriction patterns . further conjugation, antibiotic resistance and pcr characterization of incompatibility and orit types, mobile element is <dig>  class  <dig> integron, and amp resistance genes blatem and blacmy- <dig> were performed for these two plasmid types. type  <dig> plasmids were separated into  <dig> subtypes  based on differences in plasmid size ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb and restriction pattern. all plasmids carried blatem, replicons f1a and f1b, is <dig>  and a class  <dig> integron  with a gene cluster of dfra12-orff-aada2-qaceΔ1-suli, conferring resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  and disappearing in plasmid  <dig> g , which apparently coincides with that in the plasmid of s. typhimurium . the size of r plasmid was associated with antimicrobial resistance and conjugation capability . only type 1a plasmids, with a size of  <dig>  kb and conferring resistance to amp, chl, kan, sxt and tet, and 1b plasmids, with a size of  <dig>  kb and encoding resistance to amp and sxt, were capable of conjugation, with efficiencies ranging  <dig>  ~  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the other smaller plasmids, with sizes ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb and encoding resistance to amp and sxt for 1c-1e and 1g, and to amp, chl, sxt and tet for 1f, were not capable of conjugation. due to differences in plasmid size and since is <dig> could be involved in plasmid transposition and recombination, we performed pcr amplification with the is <dig> in primers and is26out primers for all type  <dig> plasmids . in contrast to a  <dig> -kb pcr product in the largest 1a plasmid, 1b, 1d, and 1e plasmids lacked any pcr products; 1e and 1g plasmids presented  <dig>  kb pcr products; and 1c plasmid yielded two pcr products with sizes of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb. these results suggest that the number of is <dig> and/or distance between two is <dig> elements differed among these type  <dig> plasmids. in contrast to type  <dig> plasmids, type  <dig> plasmids were much smaller in size  and had higher conjugation efficiencies, ranging from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . in addition, type  <dig> plasmids were the inci <dig> plasmid and contained orit as well as tnpa-blacmy-2-blc-suge .

discussion
human salmonellosis was limited to five salmonella serogroups: b, c <dig>  c2-c <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig> . despite the decrease in prevalence of s. typhimurium and the increase in the prevalence of s. enteritidis from  <dig> to  <dig>  serogroups b and d salmonellae were the major pathogens for foodborne salmonellosis in taiwan due to s. typhimurium, s. stanley, and s. enteritidis of serogroup d <dig> being the three most prevalent serovars overall. although the prevalence of serogroups c <dig> and c2-c <dig> were similar ,  <dig> prevalent serovars and  <dig> main serovars were found in serogroup c <dig> and serogroup c2-c <dig>  respectively. in the present study, a shift in prevalence was observed in these four prevalent serogroup c <dig> serovars: a rapidly decrease in the prevalence of s. choleresuis, mainly due to enhancement of sanitation and control of swine in taiwan, and an increase in prevalence of s. bareilly and other serovars . compared to the  <dig> % increase in the prevalence of s. braenderup from  <dig> to  <dig> in southern taiwan  <cit> , the change in the prevalence of isolates in this study ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with a trend of decrease from  <dig> to  <dig>  except an increase of s. braenderup infection in  <dig> , suggesting possibly occurrence of outbreaks in this year.

contrary to earlier reports that s. bareilly and s. braenderup are closely related genetically  <cit> , resistant to  <dig> salmonella bacteriophages  <cit> , and infect immuno-compromised patients, differences between s. braenderup and s. bareilly were found in the prevalence trend from  <dig> to  <dig> , patients' age group , and plasmid profile as well as antimicrobial resistance groups and xbai-pfge patterns . in addition to genetic differences between these two serovars, differences in animal hosts were also observed in both serovars based on the geographic regions from which they were isolated  <cit> . in this study, we found that s. bareilley isolates were highly homogeneous genetically and that s. braenderup isolates were much diverse in our pfge and plasmid analysis . this may explain why s. braenderup, but not s. bareilly, has been frequently reported  <cit> . to differentiate s. braenderup, several molecular methods have been developed, including phage typing  <cit>  and plasmid analysis as performed in this study .

unlike mdr s. choleraesuis isolated from pigs and humans  <cit> , s. braenderup and s. bareilly isolated from pigs were highly susceptible to antibiotics in  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, in a study of resistance to  <dig> antibiotics for salmonella isolated from turtles, s. bareilly was still susceptible to all antibiotics, and, in contrast, few s. braenderup isolates were resistant to gentamycin , sulfisoxazole  and tet   <cit> . in our study, almost all of the cluster a isolates of s. braenderup were mdr and associated with large mdr plasmids . although rflp analysis separated type  <dig> plasmids into  <dig> subtypes, based on antimicrobial resistance encoded by these plasmids,  <dig> subtypes were observed, conferring resistance to amp and sxt , amp, chl, sxt, and tet  and amp, chl, kan, sxt and tet , respectively . apparently, the dfra12-orff-aada2-qaceΔ1-suli region of class  <dig> integrons, which is frequently found in mdr salmonella  <cit> , was located on mdr plasmid and conferred resistance to sxt . insertion sequence is <dig> existed in all  and differed from plasmids in s. braenderburg found in spain  <cit> . the size change in type  <dig> plasmids may be due to presence of multiple is <dig> elements that may be involved in plasmid rearrangement .

although conjugation capability of type  <dig> plasmids was higher than that of type  <dig> plasmids, we only identified coexistence of type  <dig> and  <dig> plasmids in three s. braenderup isolates, which differed in isolation day and pfge pattern . isolate  <dig> with type 1f and 2a plasmids was collected in july of  <dig> from taipei. isolate  <dig> with type 1d and 2a plasmids and isolate  <dig> with 1c and 2b plasmids were collected in march and may of  <dig>  respectively, from taichung . only one isolate  <dig> with a type 1d plasmid was collected before those three isolates, in june of  <dig> from taichung. these results suggest possibly that isolate  <dig> with a <dig> genotype and r <dig> resistance pattern may be derived from isolate  <dig> with a type  <dig> plasmid, a <dig> genotype and r <dig> resistance pattern by introduction of a type  <dig> plasmid. interestingly, type  <dig> plasmids are inci <dig> plasmids, carrying the tnpa-blacmy-2-blc-suge structure . ampc β-lactamases are broadly distributed among the enteribacteriaceae, and plasmid-mediated ampc β-lactamases include acc, act, cfe, cmy, dha, fox, lat, mir, and mox  <cit> . at least three transposase associated genetic structures for blacmy include isecp1-blacmy-2-blc-suge, iscr1-blacmy-9-yqgf-yqge and is26-frdc-frdd-ampr-blacmy-13-blc-suge-is <dig>  <cit> . recently, blacmy has been shown to be broadly spread in salmonella worldwide  <cit>  and to be present in s. braenderup  <cit> . in taiwan, since we reported the tnpa-blacmy-2-blc-suge structure in s. choleraesuis in  <dig>  <cit> , this transposon-like element has been found in other salmonella serovars and enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . in the present study, we first reported that s. braenderup harbors tnpa-blacmy-2-blc-suge on a type  <dig> plasmid. comparing this plasmid with the 138-kb plasmid psc <dig>  of s. choleraesuis, both are inci <dig> plasmids with the tnpa-blacmy-2-blc-suge structure. however, type  <dig> plasmids were conjugative and much smaller in size due to lack of a 60-kb dna region with multiple integrons and transposons, which carry mdr genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
over 95% cases of human salmonellosis surveyed in this study were caused by  <dig> salmonella serogroups: b, c <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig>  as two prevalent serogroup c <dig> serovars, s. braenderup and s. bareiley differed in patients' age groups and xbai-pfge patterns. both serovars were clonally disseminated and drug-susceptible. however, in s. braenderup, cluster a mdr isolates were derived from susceptible isolates by sequential introduction of two distinct r plasmids. type  <dig> plasmids carry blatem, f1a/f1b replicons, insertion sequence is <dig>  and a class  <dig> integron with a gene cluster comprised of dfra12-orff-aada2-qaceΔ1-suli. in contrast, type  <dig> plasmids consist of inci <dig> replicon and tnpa-blacmy-2-blc-suge. although type  <dig> plasmids showed higher conjugation capability, type  <dig> plasmids were the predominant plasmids responsible for mdr dissemination in s. braenderup.
