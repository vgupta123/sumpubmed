BACKGROUND
as a staple food for more than half of the world’s population, rice  is the most important crop in asia  <cit> , and insect pests are a main factor affecting rice production. rice brown planthopper , which sucks sap from the plant’s phloem, is highly destructive  <cit> . in addition to direct damage, bph, as the intermediate vector, can infect rice with pathogens, such as grass stunt virus and ragged stunt virus, leading to further yield losses  <cit> .

since the 1960s, rice breeders have endeavored to identify bph-resistant germplasms and develop bph-resistant rice varieties. at least  <dig> bph-resistance quantitative trait loci  have been identified in rice. among these, the chromosomal locations of  <dig> have been determined, and  <dig> have been fine-mapped. most of these bph-resistance genes were identified from wild rice, few from indica rice and none from japonica rice .

four major bph-resistance qtls, bph <dig>  bph3/bph <dig>  bph26/bph <dig> and bph <dig>  were cloned using map-based techniques . bph <dig> and bph <dig> encode coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins that resemble the r genes of the nucleotide-binding–leucine-rich repeat family, which mediate plant resistance to pathogens  <cit> . bph <dig> and bph <dig> are presumed to induce effector-triggered immunity, like the r genes, because they share similar conserved protein domains. the expression of bph <dig> is induced by bph infestation, and it then activates the salicylic acid  signaling pathway, induces calluses deposition in phloem cells and enhances trypsin inhibitor production  <cit> . bph <dig>  like bph <dig>  also mediates sucking inhibition in the phloem sieve element. the bph <dig> locus is a cluster of three genes encoding plasma membrane-localized lectin receptor kinases . bph <dig> was proposed to play a critical role in priming the pattern-triggered immunity response to bph infestation by perceiving herbivore-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns due to the functions of recently discovered lectin receptor kinases  <cit> . bph <dig> is a recessive resistance gene that encodes a b <dig> dna-binding domain that contains a protein that has a dna mutation in the b <dig> domain. bph <dig> was proposed to have lost the function of the dominant allele, which is required for the settling of insects, and thus confers an antixenosis resistance in conjunction with an anther recessive locus  <cit> . the cloning of major bph-resistance qtls facilitated the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistant rice to bph, although the biological mechanisms are not well understood.

in addition to the major bph-resistance qtls, many other rice genes that modulate bph resistance , such as oshi-lox  <cit> , bphi008a  <cit> , oserf <dig>  <cit> , ospld α <dig> and α <dig>  <cit> , oshpl <dig>  <cit> , osacs <dig>  <cit> , osaoc  <cit> , osr9-lox <dig>  <cit> , and osjmt <dig>  <cit> , have recently been isolated. most of them were identified using a reverse genetics strategy, and all of them are involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways of the plant hormones sa, jasmonic acid  and ethylene , indicating that these hormones play important roles in rice defense responses to bph. sa is generally considered to positively regulate plant defense responses against pathogens and piercing-sucking insects, which cause minimal levels of physical injury to the host plants. the major bph-resistance qtls bph <dig> and bph <dig> enhance the expression of the sa synthesis-related genes and the homolog of arabidopsis nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes  <dig>  a key regulator of sa-dependent systemic acquired resistance after bph infestation. they also suppress the expression levels of the ja synthesis-related genes and the ethylene signaling pathway receptor gene ethylene insensitive  <dig>  <cit> .

ja is associated with wounding responses and positively regulates the plant defense response against chewing insects that cause extensive damage to the host. the interactions between sa and ja are commonly antagonistic, with sa having a suppression effect on ja accumulation and signaling. et is considered to fine-tune the ja-induced responses, and ja and et are synergistic. many rice genes involved in ja metabolism, including oshi-lox  <cit> , osplda <dig> and -a <dig>  <cit> , oshpl <dig>  <cit> , aoc  <cit> , osr9-lox <dig>  <cit>  and osjmt <dig>  <cit> , can modulate bph resistance. ja and its metabolites have diverse functions in bph resistance. the et pathway is generally considered to negatively modulate the bph resistance of rice  <cit> . the et-responsive gene oserf <dig> encodes a nucleus-localized protein, which is rapidly up-regulated in response to infestations of the rice striped stem borer . transgenic rice overexpressing oserf <dig> exhibit improved ssb resistance but are more susceptible to bph. osacs <dig> encodes a rice 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase gene, which is inducible by both ssb and bph infestations. suppression of osacs <dig> expression in rice reduced the elicited ethylene emissions and ssb resistance, but enhanced bph resistance  <cit> .

‘rathu heenati’ , an indica rice cultivar from sri lanka, has a high, durable resistance to all of the bph biotypes. rh is regularly used as a positive control when identifying bph resistant rice varieties and is an important bph-resistance donor for rice breeding. in this study, a cdna microarray analysis was performed to profile the whole genome expression of rh, and a bph-susceptible rice cultivar ‘taichung native 1’  was used as the control. all of the rice plants were grown under three treatment conditions, natural growth , needle puncturing  and bph infestation, and two sampling time points,  <dig> and 24 h after treatment, were used. the changes in the levels of sa and ja in rh and tn <dig> seedlings were also determined at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after bph infestation. the et content is difficult to measure because of its volatility and was, therefore, not determined in this study. this study revealed the resistance responses of rh to bph at the genomic transcription level and through changes in the ja and sa contents. the results of this study aid in understanding the biological foundation of the bph resistance of rh and in identifying new bph resistance-related genes for rice breeding.

RESULTS
genome-wide comparison of differentially-expressed probe sets between rh and tn <dig> under bph infestation
the experimental design included two rice varieties , three treatments  and two sampling time points . there were  <dig> samples in total, with  <dig> biological replicates per sample. the abbreviations r6c, r24c, r6n, r24n, r6p, r24p, t6c, t24c, t6n, t24n, t6p and t24p were used to represent these  <dig> samples, where the first letter, r or t, indicates the rice varieties rh or tn <dig>  respectively; the arabic number in the middle indicates the  <dig> or 24 h post-treatment collection time points; and the last letter c, n or p, indicates one of the three different treatments, untreated control, needle puncturing or bph infestation, respectively. the affymetrix genechip rice genome array, containing  <dig>  probe sets, was used for the microarray analysis, and the results of all  <dig> chips were submitted to the ncbi website .

there were  <dig> differentially-expressed probe sets  detected in this study. these included  <dig> differential probe sets between different treatments,  <dig> between different varieties , and  <dig> between different sampling times, with the two non-differentiating variables being the same . to compare the gene expressional differences between rh and tn <dig>  all  <dig> differential probe sets were clustered into different groups based on their expression patterns using multi-experiment viewer . significantly,  <dig> differential probe sets in group k had low expression levels in tn <dig> and high expression levels in rh under all of the conditions; in contrast,  <dig> differential probe sets in group p had low expression levels in rh and high expression levels in tn <dig> under all of the conditions. therefore, groups k and p roughly represent the genetic background differences between rh and tn <dig>  genes related to the constitutive resistance of rh should be included in these two groups. groups a and m represent probe sets with bph infestation-specific down-  and up-regulated  expression levels in rh, respectively. genes in these two probe sets may be related to the bph infestation-responsive resistance of rh. differential probe sets in groups l, q, r and s showed regular fluctuations associated with sampling time, indicating that their expression is mainly controlled by sampling time . these four types of expression patterns included a total of  <dig> differential probe sets, accounting for almost a half of the  <dig> differential probe sets.fig.  <dig> expression pattern clustering of the differential genes in  <dig> samples. the points in each panel are from left-to-right: t6c, t24c, t6n, t24n, t6p, t24p, r6c, r24c, r6n, r24n, r6p and r <dig>  a-t present  <dig> types of expression patterns of the differential genes that are classified by the software multi experiment viewer




best reference genes for bph resistance research
reference genes are key factors that ensure the accuracy of a gene expressional analysis under specific conditions. it was very important to select a stably expressed gene under bph infestation as the reference for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  analysis . figure  <dig> shows eight frequently-used reference genes, actin- <dig> , lsd <dig> , gapdh , sdha , tpb , rps27α , hsp  and ubiquitin , and their respective signal values extracted from our microarray data under different treatments. actin- <dig> and rps27α were down-regulated in both tn <dig> and rh within 24 h after bph infestation; gapdh showed an obvious expressional difference between rh and tn1; and the expression level of lsd <dig> was stable but relatively low. among the remaining four references, tbp and ubiquitin showed better overall consistency compared with hsp and sdha. therefore, tbp and ubiquitin were determined to be suitable reference genes for bph resistance research. ubiquitin was used as the reference gene for all of the qrt-pcr analysis in this study.fig.  <dig> signal values of actin- <dig>  lsd <dig>  gapdh, sdha, tpb, rps27α, hsp, ubiquitin, os. <dig> .s1_at and os. <dig> .s1_a_at in the microarray data. among the eight frequently-used reference genes, tbp and ubiquitin were more stably expressed than the others under bph infestation. os. <dig> .s1_at  and os. <dig> .s1_a_at  are two newly identified references with stable expressions under bph infestation. error bars indicate standard deviations of three biological replicates




to find additional stable reference genes for the gene expression analysis under bph-infestation conditions,  <dig> probe sets with total variance < 5% in the microarray data were screened. two probe sets with low expressional variances and appropriate expressional levels were selected, os. <dig> .s1_at  and os. <dig> .s1_a_at  , and the genes corresponding to these two probe sets were annotated to be rab gdp dissociation inhibitor alpha and 26s protease regulatory subunit 6a, respectively, in the msu rice genome annotation project release  <dig> . they were also stably expressed during the entire life cycles of the indica rice varieties ‘minghui 63’ and ‘zhenshan 97’  <cit> .

different defense responses, at the genome level, between rh and tn <dig> to bph infestation
at 6 h after needle puncturing, there were  <dig> differential probe sets in rh compared with the samples under natural growth, while there were  <dig> in tn <dig>  indicating tn1’s more sensitive reaction to simple mechanical damage than rh. however, at 24 h after needle puncturing, fewer differential probe sets were detected in both rh  and tn <dig>  , indicating that the reactions to simple mechanical damage had almost recovered by 24 h.table  <dig> number of differentially-expressed probe sets detected in rh and tn <dig> under needle-puncturing and bph-infestation treatments


afc indicates the fold change of differential probe sets under different treatments




at 6 h after bph infestation, there were more differential probe sets in rh  than in tn <dig> . the number of differential probe sets with high fcs  was  <dig> in rh and  <dig> in tn <dig> . although tn <dig> was relatively more sensitive to simple mechanical damage, more differential probe sets were detected in rh at 6 h  after bph infestation, implying that the defense responses to bph infestation in rh was more intensive than in tn <dig>  at 24 h after bph infestation, more differential probe sets  were detected in rh compared with at 6 h, and the number of probe sets with fcs >  <dig> also increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  indicating that the signals of bph infestation were progressively transmitted to the related downstream genes. however, 24 h after bph infestation, the number of differential probe sets in tn <dig> dramatically increased to  <dig>  and the number with fcs >  <dig> also increased dramatically from  <dig> to  <dig> . thus, more differential probe sets were detected in rh at 6 h after bph infestation; however, many more differential probe sets were detected in tn <dig> at 24 h after bph infestation. many of the differential probe sets detected in tn <dig> at 24 h after bph infestation may have represented the responses to wounding and various physiological stresses resulting from the serious damage caused by the bph, instead of a resistance response. in rh, the majority of differential probe sets were up-regulated at either  <dig> or 24 h after bph infestation, indicating that the inducible expression of resistance-related genes may be the main molecular basis of the defense responses in rh to bph.

the venn diagram analysis of differential probe sets is shown as fig.  <dig>  among the differential probe sets of rh at 6 h after bph infestation,  <dig> were also present at 6 h after needle puncturing. among the differential probe sets of tn <dig> at 6 h after bph infestation,  <dig> were also present at 6 h after needle puncturing. at 24 h after the treatments, most of the differential probe sets under needle puncturing, in either rh or tn <dig>  were also present under bph infestation. by excluding the differential probe sets of rh and tn <dig> under needle puncturing and those of tn <dig> under bph infestation, a total of  <dig> rh-specific and bph-inducible probe sets were determined. these  <dig> probe sets may represent the basis of the inducible defense in rh to bph .fig.  <dig> venn diagram analysis of differential probe sets under needle-puncturing and bph infestation treatments at different times. a 6 h after needle puncturing or bph infestation in rh and tn1; b 24 h after needle puncturing or bph infestation in rh and tn1; c  <dig> and 24 h after needle puncturing or bph infestation in rh; and d  <dig> and 24 h after needle puncturing or bph infestation in tn1




gene ontology  analysis
the differential probe sets of rh and tn <dig> under needle puncturing  or bph infestation  were subjected to go analysis using goeast software, which includes two principal go categories: biological process  and molecular function  . the go analysis of the groups r24n/r24c and t24n/t24c was not conducted because very few differential probe sets were identified at 24 h after needle puncturing. the first level of bp categories and mf categories with significant differences and the percentages of related differential probe sets with annotations are shown in fig.  <dig>  as expected, in the needle-puncturing groups , ‘response to wounding’ was the go term found having significant differences. of the bp categories, the differential probe sets of ‘response to biotic stimulus’, ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to wounding’, ‘defense response to fungus’, ‘cell wall macromolecule catabolic’ and ‘chitin catabolic process’ were mainly up-regulated, while those of ‘lipid transport’ were mainly down-regulated . of the mf categories, the differential probe sets of resistance-related projects, such as ‘serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity’, ‘chitinase activity’, ‘beta-glucosidase activity’ and ‘tetrapyrrole binding’ were mainly up-regulated, while those of ‘rna methyltransferase activity’ were mainly down-regulated .fig.  <dig> percentage of differential probe sets with annotations in the t24p/t24c, t6p/t6c, t6n/t6c, r24p/r24c, r6p/r6c and r6n/r6c groups. a biological process; and b molecular function




seeking bph resistance-related gene candidates in rh
because too many differential probe sets were identified to test them individually in this study , strategies were employed to reduce the number of bph resistance-related gene candidates. one strategy was to combine the microarray analysis with qtl mapping. four bph-resistance qtls were previously reported  . in this study, we identified  <dig> differential genes between rh and tn <dig> that were located within the four bph-resistance qtl regions , and  <dig> of them are likely to be associated with the bph resistance according to their functional annotations . among them, five genes were located in the qbph <dig> region, five in bph <dig>  one in bph <dig> and three in the qbph <dig> region. a major bph-resistance qtl, bph17/bph <dig>  which was mapped in the bph <dig> region, was cloned and contains three tandem genes encoding lectin receptor kinases   <cit> . however, the expression levels of these three genes were too low to be detected in this study.table  <dig> fourteen selected candidate genes in the four bph-resistance qtls of rh

the second strategy was to determine bph resistance-related gene candidates by examining gene expression patterns. clustering the gene expression patterns divided the differential probe sets into  <dig> groups . group m represented those differential probe sets that were bph-inducible only in rh but not in tn <dig>  a venn diagram analysis also helped to remove those differential probes sets induced by both mechanical damage and bph infestation . finally,  <dig> gene candidates were selected based on the expression pattern clustering and venn diagram analysis. these selected gene candidates shared a similar expression pattern . they were inducible by bph infestation only in rh, but not by mechanical damage or in tn <dig>  among the  <dig> bph resistance-related gene candidates, os03g <dig>  which encodes a cytochrome p <dig> protein, was the only gene also located in a bph resistance qtl region .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of  <dig> selected bph resistance-related gene candidates. these gene candidates share a similar expression pattern, which was inducible by bph infestation only in rh but not by mechanical damage or in tn <dig>  the six genes in boldface were selected for further detection. a–l on the x-axis represent t6c, r6c, t24c, r24c, t6n, r6n, t24n, r24n, t6p, r6p, t24p and r24p, respectively. error bars indicate standard deviations of three biological replicates




dynamic changes of sa and ja levels and differential genes associated with sa, ja and et pathways under bph infestation
the sa and ja levels  in rh and tn <dig> were determined at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after bph infestation. overall, the sa level in both rh and tn <dig> increased significantly after bph infestation ; while the ja level in both rh and tn <dig> decreased significantly after bph infestation . moreover, the change in the sa content in rh occurred more rapidly than that in tn <dig>  the sa content in rh had increased at 6 h after bph infestation, while that in tn <dig> did not increase until 24 h .fig.  <dig> sa and ja relative change ratios in rh and tn <dig> under bph infestation. a sa relative change ratios in rh and tn1; b ja relative change ratios in rh and tn <dig>  error bars indicate standard deviations of three biological replicates




all of the differential genes under bph-infestation treatment involved in the sa, ja and et pathways are listed in table  <dig>  the information concerning the genes involved in the sa, ja and et pathways refer to kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes annotations. six differential genes involved in sa metabolism were detected, and they were up-regulated, except for one gene  that was involved in both et and sa metabolism.table  <dig> differentially-expressed genes involved in the sa, ja and et pathways during bph infestation




among  <dig> ja pathway-related genes,  <dig> were up-regulated under bph infestation in either rh or tn <dig>  however, the expression level patterns of differential genes involved in the ja pathway were diverse between rh and tn <dig> . all six differential genes in rh were up-regulated and were jasmonate zim-domain  transcription factors, which are important negative regulators in the ja signal transduction pathway, implying that the ja pathway was repressed in rh under bph infestation . all  <dig> differentially expressed genes only presented in tn <dig> under bph infestation were ja metabolism-related genes, including several ja synthesis-related lipoxygenase  genes. additionally,  <dig> differential genes related to et metabolism were detected. most of them were present in tn <dig> and were down-regulated at 24 h after bph infestation . comparatively, the et pathway in rh was less affected after bph infestation.

isolating bph-inducible promoters
microarray analysis facilitates the isolation of bph-inducible promoters. six representative bph-inducible genes were selected from  <dig> bph resistance-related gene candidates . the expression levels of these six genes were only induced by bph infestation in rh, and they were only slightly, or not at all, induced by needle puncturing or in tn <dig>  a qrt-pcr analysis showed that these six genes were also up-regulated by a sa or ja treatment .fig.  <dig> expression pattern testing of six selected bph resistance-related genes in rh and tn <dig> after independent sa and ja treatments. all six genes were up-regulated after independent sa and ja treatments. the gene expression levels in tn <dig> without a treatment were normalized as the calibrators. error bars indicate standard deviations of three biological replicates




the genomic sequences, including the promoter regions and coding sequences of these six selected bph-inducible genes, were isolated by pcr from both rh and tn <dig>  and then subjected to sequencing. no significant sequence differences in the promoter regions of these six genes were found between rh and tn <dig>  furthermore, a dna sequence comparison of the coding regions showed no differences between rh and tn <dig>  it was hypothesized that the inducibility of these genes in rh was not determined by the promoter sequences, but by the genetic background.

additional rice varieties, including four bph-resistant  and four bph-susceptible varieties , were used for further examination. similar to in rh and tn <dig>  the expression levels of the six selected genes were relatively high and significantly induced by bph infestation in all of the resistant varieties, but was relatively low and barely induced by bph infestation in all of the susceptible varieties . the genomic sequences of these six resistance-related genes were also isolated from all eight additional rice varieties and then compared. neither the promoters nor the coding sequences had any significant sequence differences between the resistant and susceptible varieties.

discussion
in this study, the whole genome-wide responses of the resistant rh and the susceptible tn <dig> under bph infestation were determined and compared through a microarray analysis. a similar study reported by wang et al., conducted a microarray analysis using rh and tn <dig> as the rice materials under infestation  <cit> . however, the study of wang et al. did not incorporate an untreated control for each sampling time point , and they simply used the samples collected at 0 h as the control for the microarray analysis. this design is problematic because the expression levels of many genes are regulated by a circadian rhythm or other environmental factors. the expression pattern clustering in our study clearly showed that  <dig> differential probe sets, such as groups l, q, r and s in fig.  <dig>  accounting for almost a half of all detected differential probe sets, were obviously affected by a circadian rhythm or other environmental factors. these were possibly mistaken for having an association with bph infestation because of the lack of a control for each sampling time. second, our study included the needle-puncturing treatment, while the study of wang et al. did not. the immune responses of rice to bph involve molecular interactions between rice and bph, and the resistance reactions of rice are triggered by specific effectors in bph saliva, which are delivered into rice cells by feeding and are recognized by specific receptors in rice  <cit> . the needle-puncturing treatment can be used to exclude those differential genes that respond to simple mechanical wounding.

there are several other studies that also profiled gene expression in rice varieties responding to bph infestation using rna-sequencing  or microarray analyses  <cit> . in the study of lv et al., rna-seq of bph susceptible wt ‘9311’ and resistant ‘9311’ introgression lines containing bph <dig> was conducted to help identify candidate genes of bph <dig>  which are located in a recombination cold spot  <cit> . the study of wang et al. compared gene expression profiles between bt and non-bt rice in response to bph infestation  <cit> . in these two studies, the genetic backgrounds of rice materials used for the gene expressional analyses were both bph susceptible ‘9311’  <cit>  or ‘xiushui 11’  <cit> ; therefore, their results could not present the responses of a rice variety resistant to bph infestation .

the microarray analysis showed significant response differences between rh and tn <dig> to bph infestation. the response of rh was more active at the early stage of bph infestation compared with tn <dig> because more differential probe sets  were detected in rh at 6 h after bph infestation than in tn <dig> . in contrast, many more differential probe sets  were detected in tn <dig> at 24 h after bph infestation than in rh . many of the differential probe sets presented at 24 h reflected the physiological and metabolic changes in tn <dig> under bph attack caused by its lack of resistance. the go analysis also confirmed that many of the differential probe sets in tn <dig> at 24 h after bph infestation were related to abiotic and biotic stresses. most differential probe sets detected in rh at either  <dig> or 24 h after bph infestation were up-regulated, implying that the up-regulation of the defense-related genes was possibly the molecular basis of bph resistance in rh.

the change in the sa level in rh occurred more rapidly than in tn <dig>  and the increase in the sa level occurred prior to the decrease in the ja level, indicating that the sa pathway plays a leading role in triggering the bph-resistance response. the decrease in the ja content was probably caused by the antagonist effect of sa, which increased after bph infestation. the up-regulation of sa synthesis-related genes was the main change trend in the sa pathway, which was consistent with the change in the sa content after bph infestation. however, differential genes in the ja pathway showed significant diverse change patterns between rh and tn <dig>  in rh, all six differential genes were up-regulated and were jaz transcription factors, which are important negative regulators of the ja pathway. while in tn <dig>   <dig> differential genes involved in ja synthesis were up-regulated and only two were jaz transcription factors. ja is also associated with wounding responses. as a susceptible variety, tn <dig> lacks bph resistance-related genes and undergoes much more serious damage under bph infestation. therefore, the up-regulation of ja synthesis-related genes probably represented a response to wounding or another stress caused by bph, instead of a resistance response.

although the four major bph resistance qtls were cloned by map-based techniques, many bph resistance-related genes, including oshi-lox  <cit> , bphi008a  <cit> , oserf <dig>  <cit> , ospld α <dig> and α <dig>  <cit> , osacs <dig>  <cit> , osr9-lox <dig>  <cit> , and osjmt <dig>  <cit> , were also isolated using a reverse genetics strategy. almost all of these bph resistance-related genes are inducible to bph or ssb infestation, and are involved in sa, ja, or et pathways. a cdna microarray analysis of rh and tn <dig> under bph infestation laid the foundations for identifying new bph resistance-related genes.

bph-responsive promoters have potential applications in developing bph-resistant genetically modified rice varieties. therefore, the approximate 2-kb upstream promoter regions of some representative rh-specific and bph-inducible genes were isolated and fused with the gus reporter gene. however, when tested in bph-susceptible rice varieties, these putative bph-inducible promoters were either not, or were poorly, induced under bph infestation. a dna sequencing analysis showed that these rh-specific and bph-inducible genes showed no significant sequence differences in both the promoter and coding regions between bph-resistant and -susceptible rice varieties. thus, the promoters of most of these bph-inducible genes were probably not bph-inducible, and they may be regulated by their upstream trans-regulators in the bph-resistance network. in other words, their expression pattern was determined by the genetic background instead of the promoter sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a cdna microarray analysis was conducted to reveal the genome-wide response differences between rh and tn <dig> under bph infestation. expression pattern clustering of differential probe sets demonstrated that  <dig> differential probe sets  may be associated with the constitutive resistance of rh and  <dig>  with the bph infestation-responsive resistance. the venn diagram analysis determined  <dig> rh-specific and bph-inducible probe sets. finally,  <dig> genes were selected as bph resistance-related gene candidates based on the expression pattern clustering and venn diagram analysis. the overall response of rh to bph infestation was more prompt than that of tn <dig>  at the global gene expression and the sa levels. in rh, the significant increase in the sa  occurred prior to the significant decrease in the ja , implying a leading role of sa in mediating bph-resistance responses. in rh, differential genes in the sa pathway were synthesis-related and up-regulated after bph infestation. the differential genes in the ja pathway were up-regulated and were jaz transcription factors, which are important negative regulators of the ja pathway. these results were consistent with the changes in the sa and ja levels in rh seedlings infested with bph. comparatively, genes involved in the et pathway were less affected by a bph infestation in rh. the results of this study aid in understanding the molecular foundation of bph resistance in the rh and facilitate the identification of new resistance-related genes for breeding bph-resistant rice varieties.
