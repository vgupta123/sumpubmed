BACKGROUND
disulfide bonds are essential for the stability and function of intracellular and secreted proteins. the subject of this work are sulfhydryl oxidases, sox, and in particular glutathione oxidases , enzymes catalysing the formation of de novo disulfide bonds between thiol groups with the subsequent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide .

  2r−sh+o2→r−s−s−r+h2o <dig> 

the name sulfhydryl oxidase is sometimes also referred to thiol oxidases , enzymes that also oxidise thiol groups using oxygen as electron acceptor but reducing it to water. thiol oxidases have been isolated from fungi, e.g. mycothecium  <cit> , piricularia and polyporus  <cit> .

the first secreted fungal enzyme containing fad and able to oxidise glutathione and several sulfhydryl compounds was reported in  <dig> from penicillium sp. k-6- <dig>  this enzyme had negligible activity on cysteines in proteins. furthermore, it was not effective on the reactivation of reduced rnase a  <cit> . in  <dig>  a secreted sulfhydryl oxidase active on protein associated thiol groups was isolated in aspergillus niger culture filtrates  <cit> . the enzyme was found to be homodimeric, and each subunit was binding tightly but non-covalently a fad molecule. a. niger sulfhydryl oxidase was active on glutathione and in a lesser extent on homocysteine, dtt, cysteine, a g-glu-cys dipeptide characterised by a carboxylamide bond  <cit>  and its presence increased the rate of reactivation of reduced ribonuclease a  <cit> . the sulfhydryl oxidase from a. niger and penicillium have a different evolutionary origin than the well-characterised intracellular sulfhydryl oxidases, of the erv family, and are thought to be more related to thioredoxin reductases and pyridine nucleotide flavin disulfide oxidoreductases  <cit> . their physiological role is however still unclear. metallo-sulfhydryl oxidases containing iron  <cit>  or copper  <cit>  have also been reported.

the action of sulfhydryl oxidases on small thiol-containing compounds and the production of hydrogen peroxide, similarly to the well-known glucose oxidase  <cit> , make sulfhydryl oxidase very attractive for the food industry. sulfhydryl oxidases can be a valid alternative to the use of chemical additives, such as potassium bromate or ascorbic acid, for the improvement of the strength and handling properties of wheat dough in the baking industry.

the aim of this work was to analyze the putative secreted sulfhydryl oxidases in the publicly available fungal genomes and to produce and biochemically characterise one of the identified enzymes, i.e. aosox <dig> from aspergillus oryzae.

RESULTS
analysis of secreted fungal sulfhydryl oxidases
the search for secreted proteins carrying a predicted disulphide oxidoreductases domain of class ii and, in particular, fad-dependent ones  retrieved among  <dig> proteins  <dig> with a signal sequence, no er retention signal and no putative transmembrane segments, and thus are highly likely to be secreted . the only characterized protein found among them is the sulfhydryl oxidase from a. niger   <cit> . numerous retrieved proteins have been found in the aspergillus spp. and neosartoria fischeri, a close relative of the aspergilli. alignment of the sequences identified allowed the selection of  <dig> proteins possessing the cxxc motif characteristic of thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases like sulfhydryl oxidases . three main deletions can be identified from the alignment in figure  <dig>  e.g. protein  lacks residues in position 57- <dig> and 302- <dig>  and protein trire <dig>  in position 190- <dig> .

sequence features typical of fad dependent pyridine nucleotide disulphide oxidoreductases  were reflected in three regions. firstly, a conserved motif characteristic of the rossmann fold gxgxxgxxxa/l, where x is any residue, is found in the n-terminal region of the sequences  suggesting that the proteins bind to a nucleotide cofactor such as fad or nad, with a βαβ-fold and possibly function as oxidoreductases  <cit> . the second conserved region is located in the middle of the protein sequence and contains the two conserved cysteine residues of the cxxc motif  that is characteristic of the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases, including sulfhydryl oxidases and, in general, oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin fold family  <cit> . many conserved residues are found in this region and the following pattern can be identified rkhhltgxxdx6gxxxyxgxyycxxcgye . here is located the atg motif common to fad and nadph-binding domains and reported to be located at the end of the fourth β-strand interacting with the cofactor  <cit> .

the dipeptide comprised between the cysteine residues has been shown to affect the redox properties of proteins with a cxxc motif  <cit> . the proline-tryptophan dipeptide found in aosox <dig> and another eleven of the sulfhydryl oxidases studied here has never been characterized, but the n-terminal proline is thought to positively affect the local conformation in dsba, a protein required for disulfide bond formation in e. coli  <cit> . quan and co-authors also showed a positive correlation between the presence of an aromatic residue in the c-terminal position and a higher catalytic efficiency. the third conserved region is in the c-terminus and includes firstly, the gd motif hgd, residues 340- <dig> in figure 1) that is involved in the binding of the ribityl moiety of fad in most flavoproteins with two-dinucleotide binding domains but not common in single fad-binding domain proteins, e.g. absent in cholesterol oxidase and glucose oxidase, and secondly, the g-helix  <cit> . the final stretch is rich in glutamic acid residues and is predicted to have intrinsic disorder, e.g., after residue e <dig> in ansox and after k <dig> in aosox <dig>  <cit> .

an overall lower level of conservation is observed in sequence  from aspergillus fumigatus and  from c. neoformans. four of the sequences retrieved  clearly group separately and have a different dipeptide  between the cysteine residues of the active site, e.g.  from magnaporthe grisea,  from n. fischeri,  from aspergillus terreus and  from a. fumigatus. the three last-named sequences have an unusually long predicted signal peptide, e.g.  <dig> residues for  and ,  <dig> residues for .

production of aosox <dig> in trichoderma reesei
a representative protein, aosox <dig> , with  <dig> % level of identity to a. niger sulfhydryl oxidase was chosen for expression in t. reesei and subsequent biochemical characterization. the aosox <dig> protein consists of  <dig> amino acids including a predicted signal sequence of  <dig> residues. the closest homologs to aosox <dig> are three putative thioredoxin reductases from aspergillus flavus , neosartorya fischeri  and a. fumigatus . aosox <dig> gene is predicted to be interrupted by two introns.

the gene coding for aosox <dig>  was amplified by pcr from the genomic dna of a. oryzae and cloned by gateway recombination into a t. reesei expression vector under the control of the strong inducible cbh <dig> promoter. a c-terminal six-histidine tag was added to the expression construct. the expression plasmid was transformed into t. reesei and, after screening, one clone, producing the highest activity on glutathione, was selected for enzyme production. the highest production level in shake flask was reached after  <dig> days of cultivation and was adequate for purification; no fermentor cultures were thus needed. the protein content of the medium at the end of the cultivation was  <dig>  g/l and aosox <dig> production level of  <dig> mg/l accounted for about 5% of the total secreted proteins, as estimated using the specific activity value. the production of aosox <dig> in an active form showed that the two introns were correctly spliced from the transcript. the secretion of aosox <dig> when its gene is expressed in t. reesei suggested its extracellular production also in the native strain, a. oryzae.

enzyme purification
attempts to purify aosox <dig> with the help of the histidine tag were unsuccessful because of the protein did not bind to copper-chelated chelating sepharose fast flow resin. besides, western blotting analysis of samples containing aosox <dig> with primary anti-histag antibodies showed no recognition. furthermore, the c-terminal peptide containing the six-histidine tag was never detected after tryptic digestion and peptide analysis. these findings suggest that possibly the histidine tag was cleaved off the recombinant enzyme by a host protease.

the aosox <dig> enzyme was purified by anion-exchange in a hitrap deae ff column  and size-exclusion chromatography on a superdex  <dig> hr 10/ <dig> column . results of a typical aosox <dig> purification are summarised in table  <dig>  aosox <dig> purification by anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography lead to an activity yield of 68% and a purification factor of  <dig>  the second purification step did not increase the purity but was crucial for the removal of brown-coloured compounds probably derived from the medium used in the cultivations.

molecular characterization
aosox <dig> in the purified form migrates in sds page in two bands at a molecular weight around  <dig> and the mw determined by mass spectrometry was  <dig>  the difference in molecular mass can be ascribed to n-glycosylation considering that six asparagine residues in the protein are potential n-glycosylation sites and a net mass reduction is observed by sds page after treatment with pngase f . deglycosylation resolved the two bands corresponding to aosox <dig> into a single one of apparently  <dig>  this suggests that the double band is due to heterogeneity of the n-glycans.

aosox <dig> in the culture medium and in the purified form was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting in the ncbi sequence database  with a maximum of  <dig> % sequence coverage . peptides containing putative n-glycosylation sites were not detected suggesting that at least some of the n-glycosylation sites would be occupied by glycans.

biochemical characterization
substrate specificity determination and inhibition studies
aosox <dig> showed activity both on small thiol compounds such as cysteine and also on larger molecules such as the tripeptide glutathione . the highest activity was registered with glutathione, similarly to the glutathione oxidase from penicillium sp. k-6- <dig>  <cit> , and the second highest with dtt. a michaelis-menten behaviour was observed with all the compounds tested and the highest activity was detected with glutathione as substrate. glutathione is however an improbable physiological substrate for secreted sulfhydryl oxidases and, even though their role is still unclear, their action on cell-wall or secreted proteins, in the formation of extracellular matrix  <cit>  or for the maturation of peptides produced non-ribosomally  <cit>  cannot be excluded.

aosox <dig> activity was only slightly affected by the presence of the chelating compound edta, the salts mgso <dig> and mnso <dig> and the denaturing agent urea . similarly to glutathione oxidase from penicillium  <cit> , the activity of aosox <dig> was drastically reduced in presence of znso <dig>  this latter result was probably due to the interaction of the zinc ion with cysteine residues necessary for the catalytic activity of aosox <dig>  considering the cysteine content of aosox <dig>  e.g.  <dig> cysteines, there is a high probability that the reactive cysteines are the c <dig> and c <dig> forming the cxxc motif.

a values are expressed as means ± standard deviations.

ph and temperature behaviour
aosox <dig> showed a significant ph stability retaining more than 80% of the initial activity when incubated in a ph range of  <dig> to  <dig> after  <dig> hours . aosox <dig> and ansox showed a similar ph stability; the ph optimum value of  <dig>  measured for aosox <dig>  was higher than the value  reported for ansox  <cit>  and similar to the ones for glutathione oxidase from penicillium . aosox <dig> showed good temperature stability at  <dig> and 40°c retaining more than 70% of the initial activity after  <dig> hours . the activity of aosox <dig> was reduced to 40% and 8% respectively, after one and  <dig> hours incubation at 50°c. no activity was detected after  <dig> minutes of incubation at  <dig> and 70°c .

molecular properties of aosox1
the absorption spectrum of aosox <dig> showed three peaks at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm and a shoulder at  <dig> nm, like for the glutathione oxidase from penicillium  <cit> , revealing its flavoenzymatic nature . the cofactor was spectrophotometrically identified to be fad after the cofactor was released from the enzyme by thermal and chemical denaturation .

the secondary structure of aosox <dig> presented alpha-helical elements, as evidenced by the two negative peaks at  <dig> and  <dig> nm in the cd spectrum . thermal denaturation of aosox <dig> revealed a melting temperature of 57°c . the available three-dimensional structures are of intracellular sulfhydryl oxidases and it would be interesting to see how the structure of a secreted enzyme like aosox <dig> compares with these structures.

the stability of aosox <dig> against chaotropic denaturants, e.g. guanidinium hydrochloride, was studied by equilibrium unfolding measurements . the exposure of the tryptophan side chains to a more polar environment, as a result of protein unfolding was reflected in a red shift of the fluorescence peak from  <dig> to  <dig> nm and was completed at a  <dig>  m denaturant concentration. tryptophan and fad fluorescence had both a marked increase between  <dig> and  <dig>  m denaturant concentration that can be due to the presence of three of the six tryptophan residues of aosox <dig>  in close proximity of the catalytically active di-cysteine pair and thus possibly to the isoalloxazinic ring of the fad cofactor. a drastic loss of activity was observed at a denaturant concentration above  <dig> m.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study the sequences of potentially secreted fungal sulfhydryl oxidases were analyzed and a novel representative enzyme, aosox <dig> from a. oryzae, was produced in t. reesei in an active form. the characteristics of the enzymes are typical for sulfhydryl oxidases: the enzyme is capable of oxidizing small molecular compounds like glutathione, dtt and cysteine and the enzyme has a non-covalently bound fad as a cofactor. further testing of the activity on thiol groups within larger peptides and on protein level will be needed to assess the application potential of this enzyme.
