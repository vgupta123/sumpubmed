BACKGROUND
cellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource on earth, whose natural degradation represents an important part of the carbon cycle within the biosphere
 <cit> . the complete degradation of the cellulose requires the synergistic action of endo-β-glucanase , exo-β-glucanase , and β-glucosidase 
 <cit> . one of the limiting steps in the enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic material is the conversion of short-chain oligosaccharides and cellobiose, which was resulted from the synergistic action of endogucanases and cellobiohydrolases, to glucose, a reaction catalyzed by β-glucosidases
 <cit> . it is well established that cellobiose inhibits the activities of most cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanses
 <cit> . β-glucosidases reduce cellobiose inhibition by hydrolyzing the disaccharide to glucose, thus allowing the cellulolytic enzymes to function more efficiently. it has been shown that the supplementation of commercially produced cellulases from fungal sources such as trichoderma reesei with β-glucosidase produced by aspergillus niger increases the rate and extent of glucose production
 <cit> .

endo-β-glucanase and exo-β-glucanase can be recovered by solid–liquid separation in cellulose hydrolysis by their cellulose binding domain , but the β-glucosidases cannot be recovered because of most β-glucosidases without the cbd, so additional β-glucosidases are necessary for the next cellulose degradation. this will increase the cost of cellulose degradation. moreover, it has been suggested that the cbd enhances the enzymatic activity of cellulolytic enzymes simply by reducing the dilution effect of the enzyme at the substrate surface, by promoting the solubilization of single glucan chains of the cellulose surface, or by loosening individual cellulose chains from the cellulose surface prior to its actual hydrolysis
 <cit> . thus, it would be interesting to study the effects of the cbd on the cellulose degradation of β-glucosidases. in nature, a β-glucosidase with an n-terminal cbd from phanerochaete chrysosporium has been purified and characterized
 <cit> . further, sarath reported the effect of a fungal cbd on the enzymatic characteristics of the β-glucosidase from saccharomycopsis fibuligera. the fusion enzyme displayed a 2– <dig> fold increasing in their hydrolytic activity toward cellulosic substrates
 <cit> . in the present study, we successfully over-expressed the β-glucosidase  gene from t. thermosaccharolyticum dsm  <dig> in e. coli. as compared on the enzyme properties, the bgl showed higher tolerant to glucose and cellobiose, more efficient in hydrolysis of cellobiose, more thermal stability than β-glucosidases from other microorganisms
 <cit> .

in this work, the glucose-tolerant β-glucosidase  from t. thermosaccharolyticum dsm  <dig> was fused with cellulose binding domain  of clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome anchoring protein, the biochemical characterization and cellulose binding property of bgl-cbd were determined, and its application in hydrolysis of cellulose was evaluated.

 <cit> : glucose yield  =  <dig> *100*glucose /initial cellulose or cellobiose .

RESULTS
gene cloning and production of bgl-cbd fusion
for the fusion of bgl with cbd, the plasmids pet-bgl-cbd and pet-bgl-linker-cbd were successfully constructed by linking the t. thermosaccharolyticum dsm  <dig> glucose-tolerant β-glucosidase gene bgl <cit>  to the gene fragment encoding cbd from c. cellulovorans cellulosome anchoring protein with or without a flexible peptide linker . the bgl-cbd without a flexible peptide linker was identified with worse thermostability than the bgl, and thermostability assays indicated that its residual activity was less than 10% after being incubated at 50°c for 20 min . a key consideration in construction of fusion enzymes is the preservation or improvement of the protein and enzymatic characteristics of the individual components. simple head-to-tail in-frame fusions of two proteins often result in non-functional proteins due to either incorrect folding or restrained ability to interact with other protein subunits
 <cit> . to increase the thermostability of the bgl-cbd, a flexible peptide linker containing  was inserted in the middle of the bgl-cbd, which often conferred the necessary flexibility for the individual proteins to maintain their functionalities. as expected, the bgl-cbd with a flexible peptide linker showed the good thermostability .

characterization of recombinant bgl-cbd fusion
the fusion enzymes  were expressed in e. coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by heat treatment followed by ni-nta affinity . the β-glucosidase activity expression from pet-bgl-linker-cbd was  <dig> u/ml, which was about  <dig>  times higher than the expressed from pet-20-bgl
 <cit> . the molecular weight of the fusion enzyme was estimated to be about 69 kda in comparison to 52 kda of the native enzyme  . the fusion enzymes were purified by  <dig> -fold, and its specific activity reached  <dig>  u/mg .

the biochemical properties were investigated by using the purified recombinant enzyme. the data illustrates a diverse trend of hydrolytic pattern between the native enzyme bgl and the fusion enzyme bgl-cbd. the bgl, tested for activity showed a quick increasing in activity through ph  <dig> - <dig>  up to the highest activity at ph  <dig> . the bgl-cbd displayed the optimal activity at ph  <dig>  . it is important for the β-glucosidase to remain active at low ph, because the optimal ph of the commercial cellulase from t. reesei was  <dig> 
 <cit> . the addition of the β-glucosidase must be right for the commercial cellulase. the activity of bgl was only 16% of the maximum activity at the ph  <dig> , while the activity of bgl-cbd was higher than 60% of the maximum activity at the ph  <dig> , so the bgl-cbd is more adaptable in the application of cellulose hydrolysis than bgl. the optimal temperature for the activity of the bgl-cbd was 65°c, slightly lower than that of the bgl  , while the ph and thermal stabilities of the bgl-cbd were similar to those of the bgl . the bgl-cbd residual activity was more than 90% after being incubated at 60°c for 1 h. the stability of enzyme during catalysis reaction and longtime storage is an important factor from the viewpoint of industrial application
 <cit> .

it has been suggested that the cbd enhances the enzymatic activity of cellulolytic enzymes simply by reducing the dilution effect of the enzyme at the substrate surface
 <cit> , by promoting the solubilization of single glucan chains off the cellulose surface
 <cit> , or by loosening individual cellulose chains from the cellulose surface prior to its actual hydrolysis
 <cit> . the michaelis-menten constants for the bgl-cbd and the bgl are listed in table 
 <dig>  the v
max
/k
m
 value of the bgl-cbd for cellobiose was  <dig> u/mg*mm, which was six times higher than that of bgl. furthermore, the activity of bgl-cbd was enhanced by the concentration of glucose below 200 mm, and the enzyme activity was increased by 140% when adding 200 mm glucose into reaction mixtures. with glucose further increasing, the activity of bgl-cbd was gradually inhibited, with a k
i
 of 1200 mm glucose . the bgl-cbd yielded approximately two times higher k
i
 values for glucose than the bgl. these results indicated that the cbd coupled to a non-cellulolytic β-glucosidase enzyme modulates its ability to hydrolyze cellobiose and tolerate glucose.

immobilization of bgl-cbd onto microcrystalline cellulose
the purified bgl-cbd enzyme was mixed with microcrystalline cellulose in the quantitative experiments. the adsorption of bgl-cbd on cellulose reached plateau in 25 min . it was reported that binding forces between cbd and cellulose were attributed mainly to hydrophobic interactions
 <cit> . the adsorption efficiency might be influenced by a series of environmental factors, such as temperature, salt concentration, and solution ph. the binding was obviously increased by 120% with increasing nacl concentrations from  <dig> to 300 mm, as shown in figure 
5a. the rise of binding became slight when the nacl concentration was larger than 300 mm. even the adsorption increased by no more than 2%, when continuously increasing nacl concentrations was up to 500 mm. the effect of solution ph on the adsorption was not so significant .

to investigate the immobilization efficiency, various amount of cellulose were mixed with  <dig> u of purified bgl-cbd. as shown in figure 
5c, the total immobilized enzyme activity increased notably with increasing cellulose amounts up to  <dig>  g, and then the rise became slight and nearly reached a plateau. in contrast, the specific activity of enzyme immobilized on per gram of the matrix was consistently reduced with the increase of cellulose amounts. considering the industrial cost, a gram of cellulose was found to absorb  <dig> u of enzyme  in ph  <dig>  at 50°c for 25 min with a high immobilization efficiency of 90%. on the contrary, the cellulose is hard to absorb the bgl in the same conditions . the purified enzyme was used to evaluated the adsorption isotherm of bgl-cbd on avicel. the amount of equilibrium adsorption of bgl-cbd on a constant amount of avicel increased gradually with the increase of bgl-cbd concentration in the solution. figure 
 <dig> shows that the isothem of adsorption of the fusion enzyme on avicel is well coincident with that of langmuir isotherm model, and in condition of 50°c and ph  <dig> , the equilibrium adsorbing capacity is  <dig>  mg/g , which is close to the exprerimental value.

analysis of cellobiose degradation and reusability
production of glucose from 290 mm cellobiose  by the bgl-cbd was examined. as shown in figure 
4b, the hydrolysis rate of cellobiose increased remarkably with increasing time up to 2 h, and then the rise became slight. the hydrolysis rate of cellobiose reached 90% in 4 h. the hydrolytic activity of the bgl-cbd was greater than that of the bgl
 <cit> , because the v
max
/k
m
 value of the bgl-cbd for cellobiose was six times higher than that of bgl.

the operational stability of the bgl-cbd was evaluated through the repeated process. the bgl-cbd enzyme retained over 85% of its initial activity after successive utilization for  <dig> batches. the hydrolysis rates of cellobiose were all above 70% for each batch . these results suggested that the bgl-cbd is quite stable in the applications. this high operational stability could significantly reduce the operation cost in industrial application.

application in producing glucose from cellulose 
to order to study the effect of the bgl-cbd on more complex substrate, avicel ph <dig> was used. the bgl-cbd or novozyme  <dig> was combined with the cellulase  during the hydrolysis trials. figure 
7a showed that the yields of glucose using the cellulase with novozyme  <dig> and the cellulase with the bgl-cbd were 47% and 58%, respectively. the yields of glucose increased  <dig> % with the bgl-cbd in substitution for the novozyme  <dig> 

moreover, the endo-β-glucanase and exo-β-glucanase from t. reesei have a conserved tripartite structure with a large catalytic core domain linked by an o-glucosylated peptide to a cellulose-binding domain , which is required for interaction with crystalline cellulose
 <cit> . thus, endo-β-glucanases and exo-β-glucanases can also be absorbed by the residual cellulose, and be reused for the next process. thus, the cellulase with novozyme  <dig> and the cellulase with the bgl-cbd were recovered by centrifugation 15 min at  <dig>  000 g, washed, and then used for a new hydrolysis cycle with the fresh substrate, respectively. it can be observed that after the first cycle, the yields of glucose were above 18% , which was higher than the novozyme  <dig>  but the yields of glucose were only half of the yields of glucose in the first cycle . the loss in the yields of glucose could be due to the deactivation of enzymes during each hydrolysis cycle or to loss of immobilized enzyme cellulose during the separation. but no matter what, the results confirm that the bgl-cbd shows promise for cellulose hydrolysis.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provided an efficient method for cellulose hydrolysis by the cellulose-binding fusion β-glucosidase. the bgl-cbd displayed a 6-fold increase in v

 for cellobiose in comparison with the bgl. the bgl-cbd immobilized orientedly on to cellulose with high efficiency . using the bgl-cbd as the catalyst, the yield of glucose reached a maximum of 90% from 100 g/l cellobiose  at 50°c for 4 h. the bgl-cbd could retain over 85% activity after five batches with the glucose yields all above 70%. moreover, the hydrolytic activity of bgl-cbd is greater than that of the novozyme  <dig> in cellulose degradation.
