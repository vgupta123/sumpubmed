BACKGROUND
sequencing and analysis of expressed sequence tags  has been a primary tool for the discovery of novel genes and for annotation of genomic sequences in plants. ests provide large-scale characterization of mrna populations through single-pass sequencing of cdna. in crop species with a highly repetitive genome like maize, est sequencing represents a rapid and cost-effective method for analyzing the transcribed region of the genome, allowing a distinction between functional genes and pseudogenes. ests can be used for other functional genomic projects including gene expression profiling, microarrays, molecular markers and physical mapping. sequencing of ests from a non-normalized cdna library using a high throughput approach could be useful for the quantitative assessment of transcript abundance and also for the discovery of novel transcribed sequences. in addition, ultra-deep sequencing of a non-normalized cdna library could overcome the high sequence redundancy rates that the library might present.

quantitative estimates of gene expression are also possible with large number of ests derived from diverse libraries  <cit> . other high throughput approaches for quantitative and qualitative genome-wide gene expression profiling are serial analysis of gene expression   <cit>  and massively parallel signature sequencing   <cit> . sage has been largely used in animal systems and more recently sage collections for several plant species have been made available  <cit> . in contrast, mpss has been more widely used in plants than in animal species  <cit> .

large-scale pyrosequencing of cdnas offers a unique and an alternative opportunity to deeply explore the nature and complexity of a given transcriptional universe. currently, one gs20– <dig> sequencing run produces a minimum of  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> nt. applications of the  <dig> technology in plants include the sequencing of barley's bacs  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana mirnas  <cit>  and cdna libraries of medicago truncatula  <cit> , a. thaliana  <cit>  and the shoot apical meristem of maize  <cit> . although these efforts have produced a large amount of valuable transcriptional information, the procedure has not yet been optimized for the sequencing of cdnas, and the amount of sequencing runs or gs20– <dig> reads that are necessary to reach full coverage or "near identity saturation" of a target transcriptome remains to be determined. an estimation of these types of representational parameters is important for large-scale est projects that rely on  <dig> technology for large-scale transcriptional analysis.

mexico is considered the center of origin and domestication of maize. with no less than  <dig> native landraces and many distinct environmental adaptations, mexican germplasm has been essential to harness important traits for crop improvement. palomero toluqueño is a landrace of the central and northern highlands group characterized by short plants with frequent tassel branches, small conically shaped ears, a weakly developed root system, and pubescent leaf sheaths often pigmented by anthocyanins. it is one of several ancient landraces that are believed to have spread from the pacific coast to northern areas of mexico, contributing to the emergence of popcorn elite cultivars in the usa  <cit> .

as part of a genomic platform for the systematic exploration of landrace genetic diversity, we analyzed over  <dig>  million quality-filtered reads generated by  <dig> consecutive pyrosequencing runs of a single cdna library derived from  <dig> week old plants of edmx <dig> palomero toluqueño maize, and compared them to publically available ests, and maize assembled gene islands  from the b <dig> maize inbred line. magis are genomic sequence assemblies from regions that are enriched in transcriptionally active units  <cit> . this collection of  <dig> quality-filtered reads was sufficient to find transcripts corresponding to 50% of public maize ests. comparisons to the magis revealed that 11% of them align with our collection of palomero sequences. we estimate that  <dig> %  do not align with public ests or annotated genes and potentially represent new maize transcripts. our results indicate that recurrent pyrosequencing is necessary to attain a thorough representation of the transcriptional universe present in a single cdna sample, suggesting that large-scale transcriptional sequencing of native germplasm will emerge as an important tool to characterize the functional diversity of maize, as well as the identification of relevant genes for particularly interesting agronomic traits.

RESULTS
generation and sequencing of the palomero cdna library
a cdna library was generated from total rna extracted from young aerial and root tissues of a mexican maize landrace as described in material and methods. we used a procedure for preparation of the maize cdna library that overcomes possible bias that may occur when sequencing short sequences of dna by  <dig> technologies. for library construction, 3'-enrichment of sequences was avoided by using random primers rather than a poly primer during a second round of cdna synthesis; the resulting cdna sample was sheared by nebulization and end-repaired before ligating the  <dig> sequencing adapter. it is expected that synthesis of cdna using oligo-dt primers will yield sequences that are 3'-enriched relative to the entire transcriptome, resulting in sequences frequently containing polyadenylated tails that significantly reduce the length of informative reads.

four runs of the cdna sample produced  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average length of  <dig>  nucleotides and a total length of  <dig>  mb. all reads were filtered to remove poly a/t, low quality sequences and those shorter than  <dig> nt using the seqclean program. after trimming, the  <dig> , <dig> raw sequences were reduced to  <dig> , <dig>  high quality sequences with an average length size of  <dig>  nt and a total length of  <dig>  mb . only  <dig> % of raw sequences were trimmed for eliminating polyadenylated tails, and only  <dig> % of raw sequences were removed due to their length  or because of their low quality score. this is in contrast to a previous report on the utilization of gs20– <dig> sequencing for large-scale transcriptional analysis of a cdna library from arabidopsis. two sequencing runs yielded  <dig>  raw reads with a mean length of  <dig> nt that was reduced to  <dig>  nt after quality control using seqclean, whereas the removed sequences represented  <dig> % of the total raw reads  <cit> . the reduced amount of low quality sequences in our library, and the average length size reduction of  <dig>  nt in the sequences after trimming is a significant improvement of the entire sequencing process using the  <dig> technology. the low amount  of the ests containing a poly a/t tail was expected as the filter for these homopolymers was applied during the cdna library construction by the use of random primers. in addition, alignment of reported maize ests that matched with several  <dig> reads shows no bias of the  <dig> reads towards any end of a corresponding est . furthermore, we found that only  <dig> % of the palomero reads have a match to maize trnas and plant small nucleolar rnas . the use of random primers combined with sample nebulization significantly improved the percentage of informative sequences as well as their length and quality, showing that these modifications are crucial to obtain high quality sequences representing a wide transcriptional universe.

analysis of high quality reads from gs20– <dig> runs and comparison to gene index and unigene databases
the number of individual reads between each 454-sequencing run showed a notorious homogeneity . after trimming we had a minimum of  <dig>   and a maximum of  <dig>   reads per run in all four sequencing runs . this represents a considerable increase in the average number of reads reported so far for a  <dig> run in cdna libraries from plants. for instance, one single  <dig> run of a medicago  <cit>  and maize  <cit>  cdna library resulted in  <dig>   and  <dig>  high quality reads, respectively. in addition, two sequencing runs of an arabidopsis cdna library yielded  <dig>  ests  <cit> . here, we obtained 40% more high quality sequences per run than those reported previously for plants, indicating that our sequencing-by-synthesis  approach represents an efficient strategy to generate large amounts of ests.

a blast-based search against the ncbi maize unigene  set revealed that  <dig>  expressed genes  are represented in our collection of unassembled palomero transcript reads. although these unigene set can be considered the minimum number of expressed genes represented in our transcript collection, it is likely an under-estimation of the universe of transcripts present in a  <dig> week old plant. the zea mays gene index  database from tigr contains  <dig>  assemblies and singletons derived from a wide variety of maize ests libraries . despite a possible redundancy of gene representation within the zmgi assembly  <cit> , this database can be used to estimate the fraction of the maize transcriptome covered by our gs20– <dig> collection of palomero transcripts. a blast comparison of all sequences generated in a single run showed that  <dig> % of zmgi sequences align with at least one gs20– <dig> sequence . this proportion increased to  <dig> % when the comparison included all sequences generated after  <dig> runs. whereas the proportion increased in  <dig> % following a second gs20– <dig> run, the fourth run increased the zmgi gene representation by only  <dig> %, indicating that a plateau of gene representation was reached following the third gs20– <dig> run . a similar comparison conducted against the unigene dataset yielded similar results . overall, these results suggest that approximately 55% of genes or ests contained in these databases are represented in the  <dig> week old plant gs20– <dig> palomero transcript collection.

comparison to maize assembled genomic islands 
to discover previously identified genomic sequences that could have new evidence of expression, we compared the maize assembled genomic islands   <cit>  to our palomero transcript collection using blast. a total of  <dig>  magis aligned to at least one gs20– <dig> transcript sequence of palomero , providing evidence that these magis contain at least portions of expressed genes. overall, these  <dig>  aligned to  <dig> % of all gs20– <dig> sequences. the remaining  <dig> % of gs20– <dig> sequences that did not have a representation in at least one magi could represent genes that have not yet been sequenced in b <dig>  but also genes specific to the palomero landrace, or palomero genes having poor homology to a possible b <dig> ortholog. from all  <dig>  magis with evidence of expression after four gs20– <dig> runs,  <dig>   did not have prior expression evidence from the alignments to the  <dig>  ncbi maize ests. table  <dig> shows the number of magis that did not have prior expression evidence in the ncbi maize ests for each gs20– <dig> run.  <dig>  magis showed novel expression evidence with sequences from a single run, less than 50% of the  <dig>  magis that showed novel expression evidence with all  <dig> sequencing runs. therefore, increasing the number of  <dig> sequencing runs shows a significant increase on the number of novel genomic sequences matched with expressed sequence tags, indicating expression evidence for such genome regions.

gene discovery and characterization of novel transcripts
to determine the number of potential novel genes found in the palomero transcript collection, the total gs20– <dig> high quality reads were compared to the unassembled ncbi maize ests , the magis version  <dig>  the maize chloroplast and mitochondria genomes and the magi repeats . using an e-value < 9e- <dig>   <dig> % of the gs20– <dig> sequences aligned with the existing ncbi maize ests, and  <dig> % aligned with the genomic sequences of magis . interestingly, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all gs20– <dig> sequences aligned to maize organelles and magi repeats, respectively . in the case of the comparison to the est collection of ncbi,  <dig> % of all gs20– <dig> sequences matched directly by blast to a specific maize transcript, whereas  <dig>   did not match with any reported maize transcribed sequence. thus, using a relatively high level of stringency,  <dig> % of the gs20– <dig> sequences potentially identify novel maize transcripts. this percentage was reduced to  <dig> %  after a blast alignment to magis, magi repeats and maize organelle databases, yielding the most conservative estimation of the proportion of novel transcripts that are represented in our palomero collection.

representation of emblematic maize genes
to assess the representation of different well-known maize genes in our palomero transcript collection, we aligned all gs20– <dig> sequences with those corresponding to  <dig> maize genes shown in table  <dig>  this same table indicates the number of gs20– <dig> reads that align with genes in stretches of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides without gaps . genes that are highly represented but seem to be more divergent in sequence are for instance ramosa <dig> and c <dig>  poorly or not represented genes are floricaula/leafy-like <dig> , knotted1-like homeodomain protein liguleless <dig> , ramosa <dig>  and teosinte branched <dig> . low expression of fl <dig>  a gene involved in flower development  <cit>  was expected due to the nature of the tissue used for the cdna synthesis . however, low representation of other genes such as tb <dig> was unexpected due to its known role in regulating the formation of secondary axillary branches in maize  <cit> . these results suggest that a complex regulation of the active transcriptome makes it difficult to predict the presence of certain transcripts based solely in the nature of the tissue used.

assembly of gs20– <dig> transcripts and quantitative assessment of transcriptional abundance
assembly of the total gs20– <dig> raw sequences was performed using the  <dig> commercial software utilities. a total of  <dig> , <dig>  reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   reads were classified as singletons and  <dig>   sequences were classified as "repeats" on the basis of their over-representation that is likely to reflect abundant transcripts. sequences in this latter category include highly expressed transcripts that are generally difficult to assemble. we found that 89% of these sequences have a hit to the zmgi, averaging  <dig>  reads per gene locus, whereas a similar analysis with the contigs and singletons averaged  <dig>  sequences per gene locus and 84% and 48% of the sequences have a hit to zmgi, respectively. in addition,  <dig> % of the total gs20– <dig> reads aligned to zmgi. these data indicate that the unassembled sequences represent valuable information that cannot be excluded from the global analysis of the palomero ests, and justify the use of individual gs20– <dig> reads for the coverage analysis of public databases as described in this work.

analyses performed with the  <dig>  assembled contigs included transcript abundance estimation and a survey of the contribution of our assemblies to the length of the sequences in the zmgi. for the latter, we compared the  <dig>  assembled contigs to the zmgi database and estimated the number of gs20– <dig> contigs having a sequence length larger than the aligned zmgi sequence. from  <dig>  contigs with a significant match to zmgi, we only found  <dig> that were larger than the aligned zmgi sequence. in addition, a tgicl-dependent assembly of all  <dig>  gs20– <dig> sequences candidate to represent novel transcripts resulted in  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons, suggesting that most of these unique sequences represent rare transcripts.

relative expression levels of known genes or ests can be approximately quantified by hybridization to microarrays; however, it is limited to genes that have been printed in the microarray, usually genes which sequence was previously determined or predicted based on genome annotation. to determine whether results of our high-throughput pyrosequencing approach reflect transcript abundance, we estimated relative abundance of several transcripts based on number of gs20– <dig> sequences assembled into a given contig and the length of that contig, according the following index:

ra = n/l; where ra, relative abundance; n, number of gs20– <dig> sequences per contig; l, length of the assembled contig.

the comparison of the  <dig> assembled contigs against the zmgi was used to assign an annotated gene locus to the  <dig> assemblies. to test this transcript abundance estimation and to calculate a relative expression ratio, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  of several  <dig> contigs. sequences to be amplified by real-time pcr were chosen according to their relative differential abundance as estimated by the index described above. primers were chosen to amplify a region of approximately  <dig> bp. additional file  <dig> shows the set of primers designed for real-time pcr of  <dig> different contigs. we found a general correlation between transcript abundance estimation based on the  <dig> sequencing and the qpcr data. table  <dig> shows a comparison of the relative abundance of several transcripts calculated by the formula described above and the cycle threshold  obtained by qpcr analysis. lower ct numbers are expected for highly abundant transcripts. for instance, the contig for tc <dig>  appeared six cycles earlier than the contig for tc <dig> . although other approaches may be needed for accurately profile transcript abundance in a cdna library, these results suggest that high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis is useful to generate quantitative information of the transcripts.

discussion
the development of pyrosequencing technologies  has contributed to total sequence information available for several multicellular organisms. in the case of maize, a single gs20– <dig> run with cdna amplified from shoot apical meristems of inbred line b <dig> resulted in ~ <dig>  ests that were sufficient to annotate more than  <dig>  genomic sequences  <cit> . a similar approach was used to demonstrate that 454-based transcriptome sequencing of inbred lines allows high-throughput acquisition of gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . more recently, large-scale sequencing of 3'-utr regions was used to resolve the expression of gene families, allowing a frequent distinction between alleles and gene family members  <cit> . although these studies have demonstrated the value of large-scale pyrosequencing technologies when applied to the analysis of specific maize transcriptomes, an in-depth estimation of the overall transcriptional universe found at a specific developmental stage had not been previously carried out.

we performed  <dig> consecutive gs20– <dig> pyrosequencing runs of a single cdna library obtained from seedlings of palomero toluqueño collected  <dig> weeks after germination, and generated the largest collection of maize transcripts corresponding to a single developmental stage. on average we obtained over  <dig> mb per run and a total of  <dig>  mb of high quality sequence, and our overall coverage was sufficient to detect transcripts similar to at least 50% of all publically available ests present in the unigene and zmgi databases. the total number of zmgi sequences that are represented in our transcript collection increased 14% between the first and the fourth pyrosequencing run; however, the fourth and last run only yielded an increase of  <dig> %, indicating that despite the importance of increasing the number of sequencing runs in terms of statistical accuracy, the last run had little contribution to the overall coverage and the discovery of novel transcripts. this percentage is slightly increased when pyrosequencing reads are compared to the magi collection, suggesting that magis might have an under representation of rare or low abundant transcripts. this is supported by the fact that increasing the number of  <dig> sequencing runs shows a significant increase on the number of novel genomic sequences matched with expressed sequence tags, providing expression evidence for such genome regions, which most probably represent genes or transcriptionally active non-coding regions with low levels of expression. overall, our analysis suggests that  <dig> consecutive pyrosequencing runs are sufficient to obtain a representation of most of the transcriptome present in palomero plantlets.

the phenotypic and molecular diversity of maize has been essential to harness important traits for crop improvement. on the basis of landrace germplasm, the activity of modern plant breeders gave rise to inbred lines currently used in hybrid production, causing significant improvements in yield, grain quality, resistance to biotic or abiotic stress, and maturity. a genome wide survey of gene content in b <dig> and mo <dig> revealed that more than 20% of gene fragments examined in allelic contigs were not shared between these  <dig> inbred lines  <cit> ; reasonable predictions anticipate that the genomic divergence between  <dig> landraces is far more important. our results identified more than  <dig>  sequences that represent novel transcripts that are expressed in palomero plantlets, indicating that a large portion of the intrinsic transcriptional diversity present in native landraces remains to be explored. the discovery of this collection of novel transcripts suggests that many more should be present in different tissues and developmental stages, opening the possibility for large-scale efforts to characterize the transcriptional universe of genetically distinct native landraces.

when estimating transcriptional abundance of representative genes, we noticed a direct correlation between the number of reads corresponding to a transcript and its level of expression assessed by qpcr, indicating the possibility that in some transcriptional ranges, deep sequencing of cdna samples could provide an accurate estimation of transcriptional abundance. it is likely that an increase in the number of pyrosequencing runs could enhance the accuracy of this type of quantitative estimations, as the number of pyrosequencing runs necessary for deep coverage of a given transcriptome will depend on the nature and the complexity of the sample. overall, our results suggest that a systematic and detailed characterization of gene expression in maize using high-throughput technologies will generate useful information for the understanding of maize biology.

access to large-scale landrace transcriptional sequences promise to become an invaluable source of polymorphic information for exploring maize natural variation and exploiting allele diversity and recombination. we expect that a renewed interest in landrace germplasm will emerge with the development of new initiatives to explore the functional diversity of maize.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, using an optimized protocol for pyrosequencing of a palomero cdna library we generated and analyzed the largest collection of maize transcripts corresponding to a single developmental stage. the palomero sequences covered over 50% of all reported maize unigenes, and an estimated of  <dig> % of the reads potentially represent new maize transcripts. our results indicate that recurrent pyrosequencing is necessary to attain a thorough representation of the transcriptional universe present in a single cdna sample, as well as for transcript abundance estimation in a non-normalized cdna library. finally, large-scale transcriptional sequencing of native landraces represents a valuable approach to characterize the functional diversity of maize.
