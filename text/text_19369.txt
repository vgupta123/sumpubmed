BACKGROUND
in mammals, pluripotency, the ability to generate derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers, is an essential characteristic of cells in the preimplantation and very early postimplantation epiblast as well as their in vitro counterparts, embryonic stem  and epiblast stem  cells respectively. the maintenance of a pluripotent state is mediated by the activity of a core transcriptional network dominated by the principal pluripotency factors oct  <dig>  nanog and sox <dig>  cells  <cit> . in humans, teratocarcinomas and teratomas, their more benign versions lacking obvious ec cells, are classified as germ cell tumours as, by puberty, they mainly occur in the testis and ovary . in neonates, however, the majority of teratomas are extragonadal and occur along the midline, most frequently in the sacrococcygeal region  <cit> . this may indicate that primordial germ cells  initiate these tumours, as they pass along the midline to reach the genital ridges. an alternative hypothesis is that a somatic cell type may acquire pluripotency resulting in teratocarcinogenesis. the midline location of these tumours might in this case indicate either a susceptible somatic cell type or a permissive environment  <cit> . in support of the latter hypothesis, ectopic oct <dig> reactivation in somatic cells from somitogenesis-stage embryos grafted to the adult kidney capsule has been shown to induce teratocarcinoma formation  <cit> . furthermore, the transient induction of the main reprogramming factors, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc in vivo drives the emergence of teratomas in a variety of somatic cell types in the adult mouse  <cit> . nevertheless, injection of pluripotent cells into a compatible embryonic environment, the blastocyst  <cit>  or postimplantation embryo  <cit>  leads to assimilation of those cells into normal development. thus the genesis of teratomas/teratocarcinomas depends on the activity of a minimal set of pluripotency factors combined with a permissive environment.

the predominant occurrence of extragonadal teratomas/teratocarcinomas in human neonates suggests that pluripotent cells are tumour-forming even during gestation. here we sought to define whether the mouse embryo is permissive for teratocarcinoma formation on ectopic expression of pluripotency factors. we found that although injected es cells efficiently induce tumour formation in midgestation embryos, ubiquitous or axial progenitor-specific ectopic expression of pluripotency factors in somitogenesis-stage embryos did not lead to the generation of tumours. instead, severe developmental abnormalities occurred along the developing axis. our findings suggest that while the somitogenesis-stage embryonic environment can suppress the neoplastic potential of cells ectopically expressing individual pluripotency factors, once pluripotency is established, pluripotent cells are capable of seeding extragonadal teratomas during gestation.

RESULTS
induction of teratomas by pluripotent cells
manual injection of es cell suspensions into conceptuses  at e <dig>  led to the appearance after birth of extragonadal teratocarcinomas in 2/ <dig> injected pups  , showing that ectopic pluripotent cells can seed teratomas during embryogenesis. no tumours were observed when non-pluripotent primary somatic cells from e <dig> - <dig>  embryos were injected into age-matched embryos embryos  . furthermore, a survey of the literature showed that, while reports of spontaneously occurring extragonadal teratomas are extremely rare, they can occur upon injection of es cells to blastocysts . in one case, they arose from a cell line known to harbour a large chromosome  <dig> deletion  <cit> , a karyotypic abnormality frequently encountered in es cell lines  <cit> . interestingly, such tumours were generally found in young mice under 9 weeks old . tumours were detected in multiple sites in the body , including two instances of tumours in the tail. in humans, extragonadal teratomas are often apparent at birth or in the early neonatal period , and while they are also found at multiple sites, some of which overlap with those in mice, the predominant location is at the base of the spine, in the sacrococcygeal region. collectively, these data indicate that persistence of pluripotent cells after the natural shutdown of embryonic pluripotency is likely to result in the formation of extragonadal teratocarcinomas/teratomas shortly after birth and suggest that the posterior midline  represents a permissive environment for the manifestation of a pluripotent phenotype.fig.  <dig> pluripotent cells and the location of extragonadal teratomas in mice and humans. a teratomas formed after manual injection of es cells to the yolk sac and/or amniotic cavity of e <dig>  embryos. ec, embryonal carcinoma; n, neural tissue; b, bone; kw, keratin whorl; c, cartilage; de, digestive epithelium; sm, striated  muscle. b locations and ages of mice developing teratomas, in this work and reported in the literature. individual animals are assigned an arbitrary identifier  to account for the presence of multiple tumours in some animals. f, female; m, male; herm, hermaphrodite; nd, not determined. c summary of teratoma location in humans . data in piecharts is arranged clockwise starting with most frequent location at  <dig> o’clock



coincidence of pluripotency transcription factors in the posterior of somitogenesis-stage embryos
we hypothesised that if the acquisition or persistence of pluripotency in somatic cells in post-gastrulation stage embryos correlates with teratocarcinoma formation in extragonadal sites then it is likely to occur in locations exhibiting pluripotency factor expression. we thus examined the presence of the main pluripotency/reprogramming factors in somitogenesis stage embryos. we have shown that nanog expression disappears around the end of gastrulation while oct <dig> becomes absent from somatic tissues by the ~10-somite  stage  <cit>  although, like nanog, its expression is retained in the pgcs  <cit> . expression of klf <dig>  one of the original factors necessary for reprogramming to induced pluripotency, was undetectable during early somitogenesis . however, in situ hybridisation analysis revealed that klf <dig> transcripts were present at later somite stages  predominantly in the posterior end of the embryo up to the tb . furthermore, we found by real-time qpcr that the chordoneural hinge , a site within the tb shown to harbour progenitor cells with neuromesodermal  potency  <cit> , also exhibited klf <dig> expression . the same region was also found by qpcr to be positive for sox <dig> expression while being devoid of oct <dig> and nanog transcripts . these data combined with the reported presence of the other main reprogramming factor c-myc in the posterior end of the embryo  <cit>  indicate that there is a coincidence of pluripotency/reprogramming factors in this location, although two major pluripotency transcription factors, oct <dig> and nanog, are absent.fig.  <dig> pluripotency factor expression in the somitogenesis stage embryo. a klf <dig> mrna expression in an e <dig>  mouse embryo analysed by wholemount in situ hybridisation.  magnified detail from image a’ showing the increased presence of klf <dig> transcripts at the posterior.  embryo section showing klf <dig> expression within the chordoneural hinge  of the e <dig>  tailbud. pcnh, region immediately posterior to cnh.  inset: klf <dig> in situ hybridisation in undifferentiated es cells  qpcr analysis of the expression of the main pluripotency factors and positive control genes  and evx1) in cnh regions microdissected from an e <dig>   embryo . expression levels are represented as relative to tbp. error bars represent s.d. mouse es cells were included as a positive control



ubiquitous induction of oct <dig> expression in vivo causes severe developmental abnormalities but does not reactivate the pluripotency indicator nanog
given the presence of several critical reprogramming factors in somatic cells of somitogenesis stage embryos we next tested the effects of restoring the expression of the principal pluripotency determinant oct <dig> during these stages. we employed a mouse line  carrying an oct <dig> transgene that is ubiquitously expressed in response to doxycycline  administration  <cit> . we have previously shown that ectopic oct <dig> induction in this line at somitogenesis stages leads to reactivation of the pluripotency indicator nanog within 24 h  after explantation in episc culture conditions and subsequent re-establishment of pluripotency evidenced by the derivation of stable episc lines and formation of teratocarcinomas from grafts of tissue pieces to the adult kidney capsule  <cit> . we thus tested whether pluripotency is reactivated in dox-treated embryos in utero. a 24 h treatment of pregnant females with dox led, as expected, to the robust upregulation of oct <dig> in transgenic embryos , and wholemount in situ hybridisation showed widespread oct <dig> expression . however, we observed no reactivation of nanog expression, as assessed either visually using a nanog-gfp reporter transgene , or by qpcr . a slight upregulation of sox <dig> in the lateral area of the somites was detected , but otherwise there was no ectopic sox <dig> expression . these results indicate that ubiquitous induction of ectopic oct <dig> expression in somitogenesis-stage embryos does not result in widespread reactivation of the pluripotency transcriptional network.fig.  <dig> induction of ubiquitous ectopic oct <dig> expression. a

although dox-treated transgenic embryos showed no evidence of pluripotency network reactivation, they exhibited consistent developmental abnormalities . the most prominent was a failure of dorsal closure of the anterior neural tube . similar brain malformations have been reported by  <cit>  after ubiquitous oct <dig> expression. however, we also observed a phenotype in the posterior parts of the axis not reported by these authors. therefore we initiated a series of experiments to explore this phenotype. treatment of heterozygous tgoct <dig> embryos  from e <dig> -e <dig>  led to severe retardation with very little somitogenesis evident . shorter treatments from e <dig> -e <dig>  or e <dig> -e <dig>  produced phenotypes in the posterior part of the axis with little perturbation to the axial regions formed prior to treatment . in axial regions formed after dox administration, a kinked neural tube, suggestive of excess neural tissue, and small somites were evident . therefore, ectopic oct <dig> expression during somitogenesis disrupts axis elongation, and in particular may interfere with the balance of neural and mesodermal tissues emanating from the tb region.fig.  <dig> phenotypic consequences of ubiquitous ectopic oct <dig> expression. a timings/duration of dox administration. b-f wildtype untreated  or 24 h dox-treated tgoct <dig> embryos  recovered at e <dig> .  high magnification views of wildtype  or dox-treated tgoct <dig> embryos showing affected somites. g-j wildtype untreated  or 24 h dox-treated tgoct <dig> embryos  recovered at e <dig> .  high magnification views of wildtype  or dox-treated tgoct <dig> embryos showing affected neural tube. k, l 72-h dox-treated tgoct <dig> e <dig>  embryo. l high magnification view showing kinked neural tube. wt, wild type; s, somite; n, neural ectoderm. arrowheads indicate the position of the somite pair formed at the time of oct <dig> induction. black arrowheads: 24 h induction ; white arrowheads: induction from e7- <dig>  scale bar: 500 μm ; 250 μm ; 800 μm . the observed phenotypes are summarised in the table



development of a novel t-based tool for inducible gene expression in the ps and tail bud
the severity of the embryonic phenotype produced by ubiquitous oct <dig> expression precluded assessment of tumour formation over a longer period. therefore we developed a system that would allow targeted and inducible transgene expression specifically at the midline of the extending axis, i.e. the site where extragonadal teratomas are most often observed in humans . we established a feeder-free e14tg2a-derived es cell line which contains a randomly integrated cassette  consisting of the ps/tb-specific  <dig>  kb t promoter fragment  <cit>  driving the reverse tetracycline transactivator rtta2s-m <dig> gene  <cit> . to conditionally express heterologous genes, we targeted a tetracycline responsive element  module coupled to a gene of interest at the hprt locus . this strategy has been shown to be very efficient for achieving introduction of single copy transgenes into a locus offering a defined chromatin environment for stable ectopic gene expression  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ps-specific induction of dsred <dig>  a schematic diagram depicting the targeting strategy for the construction of the tps/tb-red es cell line. correctly targeted clones reconstruct a functional hprt locus and these are therefore resistant to hat selective medium. numbers indicate hprt exons. hat, hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine. g.o.i. gene of interest; p, promoter; tetop, tet operator sequences. b flow cytometry analysis of dsred <dig> expression in tps/tb-red es cells cultured in the absence of lif and the presence of varying concentrations of dox for four days. e <dig>  e14tg2a; mfi, mean fluorescence intensity. c qpcr expression analysis of indicated markers in sorted dsred2+ and dsred2− differentiated tps/tb-red es cells. results are represented as log <dig> ratio of expression versus dsred2− cells. error bars represent the s.e.m . d immunocytochemical analysis of t expression in differentiated tps/tb-red es cells cultured in the presence of dox. its correlation with dsred <dig> expression as assessed by single cell image analysis is shown in the graph on the right. e dsred <dig> expression in the ps of a dox-treated chimeric e <dig>  tps/tb-red embryo. the broken line area denotes the node and emergent notochord; the arrow indicates a labelled cell cluster in the node-streak border.  representative optical confocal image sections of the posterior region of a chimeric e <dig>  tps/tb-red embryo showing the presence of dsred2+ cells in the ectoderm  and mesoderm  . cell nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole .  dsred <dig> induction in the ps of dox-treated e <dig>  chimeric c <dig>  es derived embryos. gfp expression marks chimeric contribution. ne, neuroectoderm; pxm, paraxial mesoderm.  dsred <dig> expression in the tail bud of dox-treated e <dig>   and e <dig>   c <dig> chimeric embryos. in all cases chimeric embryos were treated with doxycycline for at least 24 h prior to the indicated recovery time point



we tested the spatiotemporal specificity of our system by examining the dox-dependent expression of a tre-dsred <dig> fluorescent reporter introduced into the hprt locus in the tps/tb-rtta es cell line. we first investigated the dynamics of dsred <dig> induction in vitro by culturing the resulting tps/tb-rtta/hprttre-dsred <dig> reporter es cell line  in the absence of lif and in presence of serum. we found that these conditions promote the induction of t positive, ps-like cells within 3– <dig> days  in line with previously published data . culture of tps/tb-red es cells in –lif/+serum media and in the presence of dox promoted the induction of dsred2+ cells with dsred <dig> expression peaking at day  <dig> of differentiation . a 10-fold reduction in the levels of dox correlated with a decreased induction of dsred2+ cells , mean fluorescence intensity also decreased at low dox concentrations  indicating that our inducible gene expression system exhibits a degree of tunability . we observed no leakiness in dsred <dig> expression in the absence of dox .

to determine the identity of dsred2-expressing cells on day  <dig> after lif removal in vitro, the expression of ps markers was examined in flow sorted dsred2+ and dsred2− populations. sorted dsred2+ cells were enriched for all ps markers tested compared to their dsred2− counterparts . conversely, expression of neural markers such as sox <dig> and pax <dig> was underrepresented in dsred2+ cells . all dsred2+ cells were also t-immunopositive, although t expression was more widespread than that of dsred <dig> . this suggests that at least some t+/dsred2− cells may have a ventral node/notochord identity, since the promoter is inactive in this population. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that these cells may also reflect a lower sensitivity of detection of dsred fluorescence or differences in turnover between the dsred <dig> and t proteins. collectively, these results indicate that dsred <dig> induction takes place in vitro specifically within cells exhibiting a ps/mesodermal identity and are consistent with our previous findings that the tps/tb promoter becomes activated within the ps quite early, at the beginning of gastrulation  <cit> .

we investigated the induction of the dsred <dig> reporter in dox-treated somitogenesis-stage  chimeric embryos generated using tps/tb-red es cells modified to carry a ubiquitously-expressed gfp transgene . we found that dsred <dig> was expressed in the ps, tail bud and recently emerged mesoderm at all stages tested . at e <dig> , expression was present up to and including the epiblast close to the node , but absent in the ventral node and notochord . while early on e <dig>  , expression was almost exclusively mesodermal, later e <dig>  embryos  showed expression in emerging neurectoderm as well as mesoderm . at e <dig> - <dig> , dsred <dig> fluorescence was visible in both the ectodermal and mesodermal components of the tb as well as the emerging neurectoderm and mesoderm . the highest intensity dsred <dig> expression was seen in the presomitic mesoderm, consistent with the relatively long maturation time of this fluorescent protein  <cit> . thus the expression of dsred <dig> accurately reports activation of t expression in the ps and tb and is in agreement with previously published findings  <cit> . examination of the anterior limits of expression at e <dig>  and e <dig> - <dig>  suggests that dsred <dig> protein persists for around 24 h after its initial transcriptional activation in the ps and tb. together these data indicate that our transgenic system comprises a reliable platform for inducible heterologous gene expression in the ps and tb.

expression of oct <dig> and nanog in the primitive streak/tail bud after the start of somitogenesis does not result in neoplasia
we next examined whether expression of pluripotency factors in the primitive streak /tail bud after gastrulation is sufficient to reactivate pluripotency in vivo potentially leading to the formation of teratocarcinomas in the midline. we introduced a tre-oct4-2a-nanog-2a-venus cassette into the hprt locus in tps/tb-rtta es cells  thus allowing the simultaneous expression of three proteins: oct <dig>  nanog and venus, within cells in which the tps/tb promoter is active.fig.  <dig> ectopic induction of pluripotency factors in the ps/tail bud. a diagram showing the components of the dox-inducible pluripotency factor expression cassette targeted to the hprt locus. numbers indicate hprt exons. tetop, tet operator sequences; p, promoter. b venus expression in the tail bud of an e <dig>  wt a tps/tb-oct-nanog-venus chimeric embryo treated with dox at e <dig> . c nanog and venus expression in the tail bud of an e <dig>  wt a tps/tb-oct-nanog-venus chimeric embryo treated with dox at e <dig>  following immunostaining with a anti-nanog antibody. d experimental strategy employed for the derivation of tail bud episc explants from tps/tb-oct-nanog-venus chimeric embryos. e qpcr expression analysis of oct <dig>  nanog and endogenous nanog expression in dox-treated, untreated and wild type  episc explants as well as es cells. for detection of endogenous nanog expression a set of primers complementary to the nanog 5’utr region were employed as previously described  <cit> . expression is shown as relative to tbp. error bars represent s.d. f morphology of tps/tb-oct-nanog-venus chimeric embryos and p <dig> pups after continuous dox treatment starting at e <dig> . a wild type embryo and an untreated chimeric pup are also shown as controls. the arrowhead in the e <dig>  embryo image indicates exencephaly. far right: skeletal preps of a wild type and a chimeric p <dig> pup. the arrowhead indicates a kink in the tail of the chimeric embryo. g summary of the phenotypes observed in tps/tb-oct-nanog-venus chimeric embryos after continuous dox treatment starting at e <dig> . these correspond to each of the chimeric embryos recorded in the second column of the table with the exception of the e <dig>  chimeras where the same 4/ <dig> chimeric embryos exhibited the phenotypes noted in the panel and the remaining two chimeric embryos appeared normal. the e <dig>  chimeric embryo exhibited endogenous nanog reactivation following explantation in episc conditions. in all cases doxycycline administration started at e <dig> 



differentiation of tps/tb-rtta-oct-nanog-venus es cells in the absence of lif resulted in robust induction of venus expression correlating with the emergence of ps-like cells in vitro . these es cells were injected into blastocysts and chimeras were recovered during gestation or after development to term. dox treatment starting at e <dig>  drove efficient venus expression and transgene induction in the ps/tb . since we previously showed that nanog reactivation serves as an early indicator of successful pluripotent episc derivation  <cit> , we tested whether induction of these transgenes in explants reactivated endogenous nanog on culture in activin/fgf episc growth conditions. explantation of e <dig>  chimeric tail buds to episc culture in the presence of dox led to reactivation of endogenous nanog, revealed by qpcr using primers against the 5’utr of the nanog locus  <cit>  which is absent from the tps/tb-oct4-nanog-venus vector, , showing that oct <dig> was active in this system. most dox-treated chimeric embryos exhibited developmental defects reminiscent of those observed after ubiquitous oct <dig> induction at midgestation: open neural tube, oedema, and kinked posterior neural tube . some dox-treated chimeras were born apparently healthy although skeletal preparations revealed small kinks in the tail  while one animal exhibited hindlimb polydactyly . since we also observed the same polydactylous phenotype in one untreated control chimera  this phenotype is most likely to be unrelated to the induction of the oct4/nanog/venus transgenes. importantly, we did not observe any teratomas in dox-treated liveborn chimeric animals .

in conclusion, we find no evidence that ectopic expression of oct <dig> and nanog within the ps and tb during mid-late gestation results in tumour formation in vivo. although both ubiquitous oct <dig> expression, and tail bud-specific oct4/nanog expression reactivated pluripotency in vitro in episc culture, their embryonic expression neither reactivated endogenous nanog nor led to or the development of teratomas.

discussion
embryonic environment and tumorigenicity of pluripotent cells
human teratomas/teratocarcinomas typically occur in the gonads of postpubertal individuals and hence are classed as germ cell tumours and considered of germ cell origin  <cit> . however in prenatal and neonatal infants, teratomas most frequently occur in extra-gonadal locations  <cit> . since around 50 % of sacrococcygeal teratomas are detectable by ultrasound scan at 18– <dig> weeks  <cit> , these tumours may arise early during gestation. the predominant view regarding their aetiology is that pgcs fail to migrate properly towards the genital ridges and through evasion of apoptosis give rise to germ cell tumours  <cit> . however, the occurrence of extra-gonadal teratomas in locations distant from the canonical route of germ cell migration  raises the possibility that at least some may be of a somatic cell origin. since pluripotent cells of somatic origin are capable of normal development in gastrulation-stage embryos  <cit> , yet form teratocarcinomas in an adult environment  <cit> , there must be a stage at which pluripotent cells become neoplastic. here we provide proof-of-principle that introduction of established pluripotent cells into midgestation  embryos after normal pluripotency shutdown leads to the development of teratomas. thus, the midgestation environment is prohibitive for the integration of established pluripotent cells, and permissive for their growth as teratocarcinomas.

embryonic pluripotency is extinguished in vivo around the start of somitogenesis, coincident with a rapid downregulation first of nanog and then of oct <dig> expression  <cit> . oct <dig> is critical for the maintenance of a pluripotent state in the postimplantation epiblast and ectopic oct <dig> reactivation in post-pluripotent primary embryonic tissue after grafting beneath the adult kidney capsule leads to teratocarcinoma formation  <cit> . this led us to hypothesise that the failure of embryonic somatic cells to shut down oct <dig> might result in extragonadal teratomas. however, we did not observe tumour formation following ectopic induction of oct <dig> alone or in combination with nanog even at the posterior of the embryo, a site where the other main reprogramming factors, sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc were found to be present . so far only cells that express pluripotency gene regulatory network factors, including oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog, have been shown to produce teratocarcinomas. in adult mice, expression of oct <dig> alone leads to atypical epithelial neoplasias  <cit> , whereas expression of all four reprogramming factors produces teratocarcinomas  <cit> . thus it is likely that a cell-of-origin of spontaneously arising teratomas would express all these genes or their functional equivalents. both ubiquitous oct <dig>  <cit>  and ps/tb-specific oct4/nanog  are sufficient to promote the reassembly of the pluripotency network in episc culture, as evidenced by the reactivation of endogenous nanog expression  <cit> . however, neither of these perturbations resulted in the in vivo reactivation of the pluripotency network or teratoma formation in vivo. this reinforces the conclusion that a permissive environment, as well as the expression of intrinsic factors, is important for the formation of teratomas.

the extracellular environment is known to be important in determining the behaviour of pluripotent cells. mouse es cells readily incorporate into preimplantation embryos at the stage from which they were isolated  <cit>  and contribution to the resulting chimeras suggests that they respond correctly to differentiation cues provided by the embryo. similarly, episcs efficiently colonise cultured gastrulation-stage embryos  <cit> . however, es cells cannot integrate in post-implantation embryos  <cit>  while episcs are incompatible with either early somite-stage embryos from which pluripotency is lost  <cit>  or pre-implantation embryos  <cit> . moreover, either pluripotent cell type, when introduced into adults, forms teratocarcinomas at very high frequencies. thus, the ability of the organism to suppress neoplasia in a pluripotent cell type depends critically on the extracellular environment.

the failure of pluripotent cells to integrate correctly into a normal environment may be a necessary early step in the formation of a niche that is permissive for pluripotent cell maintenance. such a niche could either be supplied by the surrounding embryonic cells, or by the pluripotent cells themselves, for example via the ability of differentiated derivatives of pluripotent cells to secrete self-renewal factors  <cit> . the latter possibility provides a potential explanation for the ability of established lines to form tumours in midgestation embryos, while expressing oct <dig> in situ at the same stage does not. together with the observation that fresh tissue grafted to the adult kidney capsule leads to teratocarcinoma formation, this suggests that the e <dig> - <dig>  embryonic environment lacks factors that promote a pluripotency-permissive niche.

what signalling pathways could constitute a pluripotency-permissive niche? in vitro, oct4-induced nanog reactivation in somitogenesis-stage episc explants and subsequent acquisition of pluripotency is dependent on nodal/activin signalling  <cit> . at the beginning of gastrulation, nodal signalling is widespread in the posterior region of the embryo, but becomes highly restricted to the node coincident with the extinction of embryonic pluripotency at early-somite stages, and is absent after 7– <dig> somites  <cit> . similarly, activin subunit transcripts are absent from the embryo proper during the critical period of pluripotency shutdown, till around e <dig> , after which restricted expression domains appear in various regions  <cit> . moreover, nodal signalling has been shown to be critical for regulating germ cell pluripotency  <cit>  and perturbations in its levels have been linked to the formation of germ cell tumours, including extragonadal ones .

ectopic oct <dig> expression perturbs normal development
the phenotypes produced by oct <dig> expression are reproducible and dependent on the stage at which expression was induced. ubiquitous oct <dig> overexpression before closure of the cranial neural folds leads to an open brain phenotype, while expression thereafter affects mainly the parts of the anteroposterior axis that form after induction of the oct <dig> transgene, where somites are smaller than normal and the neural tube is kinked. induction of oct4/nanog in the ps/tb leads to rather similar phenotypes , suggesting both that the phenotypes observed are mainly due to oct <dig> expression, rather than nanog, and that these phenotypes result from ectopic pluripotency factor expression in the ps/tb. the combination of small somites and a kinked neural tube suggests that oct <dig> expression during somitogenesis may hinder the production or expansion of mesoderm at the expense of neurectoderm. interestingly, depletion of oct <dig> around e <dig>  severely affects both neural tube closure and somitogenesis/posterior development and results in misregulation of a number of key signalling pathways such as tgfβ and notch  <cit> . together, these findings suggest that oct <dig> plays a critical role in morphogenetic processes possibly by influencing proliferation  <cit>  and/or adhesion  <cit> .

a transgenic tool for inducible expression in the ps and the tail bud
various transgenic strategies for t-dependent expression have been reported, including targeted replacements of the t gene  <cit> , cells and mice containing integrated copies of cosmid  <cit>  or bac constructs  <cit>  spanning the t genomic region, and up to  <dig>  kb upstream of the transcription start site  <cit> . the expression of our reporter in the primitive streak but not node and notochord is consistent with these studies that show up to  <dig>  kb of upstream sequences contain only these regulatory elements. the expression of the dsred <dig> and oct/nanog transgenes specifically in the primitive streak and tail bud and their nascent mesoderm derivatives demonstrates the utility of t-rtta driver for ps and tail bud-specific expression of heterologous genes in vitro and in vivo. targeting heterologous genes at the hprt locus offers a convenient selectable strategy allowing integration of a single transgene copy at a single site in a permissive chromosomal domain thus eliminating unpredictable chromosomal position effects on expression due to random integration.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that established pluripotent cells are neoplastic if present after the time when pluripotency is normally shut down, i.e. at organogenesis stages. we also show that reactivation of oct <dig>  or oct <dig> and nanog, after pluripotency shutdown is not sufficient to reactivate pluripotency in vivo, and requires additional signals from the cellular microenvironment. it will be interesting in future to determine whether sites at which either activin/nodal/fgf or lif/bmp signalling is naturally present coincide with sites at which teratomas spontaneously arise in mice and humans.
