BACKGROUND
identifying the key features and dynamics of gene regulatory networks  is an important step towards understanding behaviours of biological systems. thanks to the development of high-throughput technology, the amount of microarray gene expression data has greatly increased, and numerous mathematical models attempt to explain gene regulations using gene networks  <cit> . once a network structure is inferred, its dynamics needs to be considered. however, most methods focus on the inference of network structure which only provides a snapshot of a given dataset. probabilistic boolean networks  represent the dynamics of grns  <cit> , but pbns are limited by the computational complexity of the related algorithms  <cit> .

in  <cit> , a new approach to the steady-state analysis of grns based on g-network theory  <cit>  is proposed, while g-networks were firstly applied to grns with simplifying assumptions concerning gene expression in  <cit> . however, the g-network approach also exhibits specific difficulties because of the large number of parameters that are needed to compute their steady-state solution. thus, in this study we reduce the number of model parameters on the basis of biological assumptions and focus on estimating two parameters in particular: the total input rate and steady-state probability of a gene.

a g-network is a probabilistic queuing network having special customers which include positive and negative "customers", signals and triggers  <cit> . it was originally developed also as a model of stochastic neuronal networks  <cit>  with "negative and positive signals or spikes" which represent inhibition and excitation. in terms of grns, a queue is a "place" in which mrnas are stored, and an mrna can be considered to be a "customer" of the g-network. the positive and negative signals are interpreted as the protein activities such as transcription factors, inducers and repressors. note that the customers or signals of the g-network can be any biological molecules. however, in our study, we focus on behaviours of mrnas because the available grn data are usually mrna expressions. each queue has an input and service rates which represent a transcription and degradation processes, respectively. our interest is to estimate the steady-state probability that a queue is busy, which corresponds to the probability that an mrna is present, and we are also interested in the total mrna input rate of each queue. to evaluation the accuracy of the proposed method, we generated a simple simulation dataset by using the stochastic gene expression models processed with the widely accepted gillespie algorithm  <cit> . we also examine a real biological dataset obtained from the cell cycle of the budding yeast  <cit> .

although queueing theory is a common computational tool, g-networks are an essential departure from queueing theory; in particular conventional queues could not be possibly applied to grns because the notion of inhibition does not exist in queueing theory but was introduced by g-network theory. there are two other essential novelties in our work. first, our approach enables us to obtain the steady-state of grns with only polynomial computational complexity due to the product form solution of g-networks; the computational cost due to large memory space and non-polynomial computational complexity are basic limitations in conventional methods such as pbn. also our method can provide more reliable measures to detect differentially expressed genes in microarray analysis .

g-networks and gene regulatory networks
the grn model used in this study is the probabilistic gene regulatory model introduced in  <cit> . in this model, let ki be integer-valued random variables which represent a quantity  of the gene i at time t. if the ki is zero, the gene i cannot interact with other genes. then we have the following probabilities,

where Λi is the total input rate , μi is the service rate . o →  <dig> as t →  <dig>  let ri is representing the activity  rate of each gene i. then 1/ri is the average time between successive interactions of gene i with other genes. if the ith gene interacts with other genes, the following events occur:

• with probability p+ , gene i activates gene j; when this happens, ki is depleted by  <dig> and kj is increased by 1

• with probability p- , gene i inhibits gene j; when this happens, both ki and kj are depleted by 1

• with probability q gene i joins with gene j to act upon gene l in excitatory mode, as a result of which both ki and kj are reduced by  <dig>  while kl is increased by 1

• with probability di, which is defined as follow,

the signal of gene i exits the system so ki is depleted by 1

let's define a random process k = , t ≥  <dig> and an n-vector of non-negative integers k = . the p  is the probability that k takes k at time t, p  = p  = k). then the probability that k have k at time t + Δt is defined by

where  is a vector that the value of ith element is ki +  <dig>  and i is indicator function which is  <dig> if the condition, x, is satisfied or  <dig> other wise. the first and second terms describe the increment and decrement of the length of queue i, respectively. third term is the probability that the gene i is activated but nothing is happened except queue i lose one mrna. from fourth to sixth terms are the probabilities that gene i is activated and interacts with gene j. the rest terms of  represent the probabilities that the interaction of gene i and gene j affect the gene l . divide  by Δt and introduce the equilibrium probability distribution of the system p = limt → ∞ p  then we obtain following dynamic behaviour,

now, let's consider following equations,  and 

where qi ) represents the probability that gene i is expressed in steady-state. using  and , e. gelenbe showed the following product form is satisfied  <cit> .

where for any subset i ⊂  <dig>  ..., n such that qm< <dig> for each m ∈ i, and i{m <dig>  ..., m|i|}.

RESULTS
simple gene regulatory networks using stochastic gene expression model
in order to assess our g-network model, we construct a simple grn structure and generate the expression data using a synthetic stochastic gene expression model  <cit> . this stochastic gene expression model has several important features such as protein dimerization  <cit>  and time delay for protein signalling  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the simulated network structure which is based on the following basic principles: the number of proteins per cell chases the number of mrnas which in turn chases the number of active genes  <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts the assumptions of our model and ~ give the corresponding processes :

where i, j ∈ {a, b, c, d} in figure  <dig>  in addition, we assume that proteins such as transcription factors and repressors require accumulation times for their activation  <cit> , and use the modified gillespie algorithm to generate the expression data  <cit> . the cell growth rate and cell volume are fixed, and we consider five cells. detailed parameters are summarized in table  <dig> with their references.

cell growth rate and the cell volume are fixed.

the transcription process in  follows an exponential distribution with transcription initiation rate λ <dig>  <cit> . the translation processes are given in  and include direct competition between the ribosome binding site and the rnase-e binding site which degrade the mrnas. thus the translation process follows a geometric distribution with probability p and busting size b = p  <cit> . td is the average time interval between successive competitions, and the number of surviving mrnas n <dig> in the population after transcription is blocked with n <dig> = n <dig>  . this is equal to thalf = -/log)td  <cit> . thus the translation initiation rate, λ <dig> = 1/td, can be computed. the protein dimer association and disassociation rates are ka <dig> and kd <dig>  respectively, as shown in  and   <cit> . we also consider the dna-protein association and disassociation rates  and , respectively)  <cit> . the degradation rate of mrna and of proteins are obtained by using the half-life of each molecule   <cit> .

we generate three sets of expression data ; each dataset has two groups, the normal and the case group. these groups are obtained with the same parameter values except for the transcription initiation rate of ga in case group is  <dig>  sec- <dig> which is half of the transcription rate in normal group,  <dig>  sec- <dig>  both groups are simulated during  <dig> seconds. in order to compare these two groups, we perform not only the g-network analysis but also the t-test which is widely used to find differentially expressed genes in microarray analysis. datasets  <dig> and  <dig> consist of  <dig> samples each which are drawn from all the data points. in dataset  <dig>  the expression of ga is significantly different  while the difference of the ga expression in dataset  <dig> is not significant. the third dataset consists of  <dig> samples which are randomly chosen from the original observations.

modeling cell cycle gene regulatory networks in budding yeast
the cell cycle regulated transcription and its overall controls have been studied in detail for budding yeast  <cit> . recent developments in high-throughput microarray techniques help to reveal many of yeast genes controlling the cell cycle  <cit>  which consists of four distinct phases: gap <dig> , synthesis , gap <dig> , and mitosis . the cells grow during their g <dig> and g <dig> phases and their dna is replicated during the s phase. in the m phase, cell growth stops and the cell divides into two daughter cells that include nuclear division. many genes are involved with specific cell cycle phases, but the number of key regulators that are responsible for the control of the cell cycle process is much smaller. thus, based on published information, we build a cell cycle grn with the key regulators in budding yeast as shown in figure  <dig>  although the relationships that contribute to the true regulatory network structure of the cell cycle still remain uncertain. therefore we simplify the cell cycle network structure by selecting thirteen key regulatory genes  and connect the genes without regard to the transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. figure  <dig> shows the reconstructed regulatory network structure.

the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases  plays an important role in controlling periodic events during cell cycle. some studies of cell cycle with high-throughput technologies have suggested alternative regulation models of periodic transcription  <cit> . d. olando et., al.  <cit>  measured the transcription levels of cell cycle related genes with the use of yeast  <dig>  oligonucleotide array and determined the manner in which transcription factor networks contribute to cdks and to global regulation of the cell-cycle transcription process. this microarray dataset is used in our study with the cell cycle network structure of figure 4; it consists of two groups: one group is obtained from wild-type  cells and the other is from cyclin-mutant  cells which are disrupted for all s-phase and mitotic cyclins .

the microarray data consist of a total of  <dig> data points taken over  <dig> minutes. we subdivide it into five states , each consisting of  <dig> data points. the expression levels are transformed by taking the natural logarithm. figure  <dig> depicts the transformed expression profiles of the  <dig> genes with  <dig> states. the black and gray solid lines are the expression profiles from wt and cm cells, respectively, and s <dig>  s <dig>  ..., s <dig> represent the five states. it is obvious that the profiles of clb <dig> are different between wt and cm cells because the cm dataset is designed to monitor the cell cycle processes without the clb cyclines.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper has used the g-network approach  <cit>  to model grns. two model parameters, the steady-state probability, qi, and the total input rate, Λi, are estimated by determining the boundary of Λi and using a grid search. we first use simulated gene expression data generated on the basis of a stochastic gene expression model. two groups  of expression data are examined. these two groups are exactly the same except for one parameter, the transcription initiation rate. we have observed that the g-network based method is able to detect the abnormally expressed genes, while the t-test produces false positives. then, using real data, we have observed that the steady-state probability of clb <dig> is lower than that of other agents and concluded that the key genes of cell cycle regulation can be expressed without the clb cyclines; this result is consistent with the original experimental study.

however, the unchanged steady-state probabilities in all the five states may need to be considered, because the cell cycle has four phases  and expressions of genes involved with a specific phase are expected to be different from those in other phases. also the small decrease rate and relatively large total input rates of clb <dig> may require a more careful analysis of the g-network approach in relation to cell cycle grn structure. the manner in which we have used g-network models in this paper did not currently include simultaneous interactions with three or more nodes. however this is not really a limiting effect of the model, since it suffices to include chain representations of dependencies in the g-network model as has been done for neuronal networks  <cit>  to cover excitatory and inhibitory effects that involve three or more nodes, and in fact random chains of nodes of any length. although in this study the probabilities that gene i affect gene j, p+  and p-  in , are fixed at the value one, we think that the conventional reverse engineering grn methods using the "ensemble" method  <cit>  can provide these probabilities more accurately for an improved steady-state analysis of grns.

in conclusion, our study has illustrated the use of g-networks as a new approach for the steady-state analysis of grns, and has shown their usefulness in obtaining quantities such as the effective transcription rate and the steady-state probabilities, using them to detect differentially expressed genes, thus introducing a new approach which differs from more conventional microarray analysis methods. future research will investigate the ensemble approaches to grns  <cit>  based on the g-network methodology in  <cit> , which will allow to infer grn structures, and also to monitor their steady-state behaviour.
