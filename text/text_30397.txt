BACKGROUND
flax  has been a valued crop plant throughout human history. its main products are its oil and fibres, which are used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food, paper and textile industries. in poland, where there is a good climate for the growth of flax, cultivation has been limited in recent decades due to the commercial competitiveness of cotton fibre and rapeseed oil. the renewal of its cultivation is significant because of the possibilities for its waste-free applications and its possible biomedical uses  <cit> . in parallel with this renewal, there has been a development of research into its genetic modification in order to improve the fibre and oil quality and increase the plants’ resistance to pathogen infections.

unlike the fibres of cotton, which are composed exclusively of cellulose, flax fibre is characterised by the presence of antioxidants. this makes it more valuable, giving it the potential to be used not only for textile manufacture, but also for the production of flax dressings and sutures  <cit> . two major factors limit the yield of good quality flax fibres: any decline in plant productivity caused by infections; and the dependence of the retting process on external and internal conditions, such as the weather, the lignification of the plant cell wall, and the pectin and hemicellulose contents of the fibre.

the flax retting process involves the separation of flax fibres from the epidermis and the cortical part of the stalk through pectin and hemicellulose degradation by microorganisms. the most common method of retting is the dew method, which involves flax decomposition in the field, with fungi and bacteria degrading the polysaccharides in the cell walls of the stalks  <cit> .

pectin is a polysaccharide with galacturonic acid residues constituting up to 70% of its overall structure. it consists of four pectin domains: homogalacturonan , rhamnogalacturonan i , rhamnogalacturonan ii  and xylogalacturonan . pectin plays a significant role in both plant physiology and plant defence against pathogen infection, as it constitutes a structural barrier to attack by fungi  <cit> . the quantitative and qualitative contribution of pectin to the construction of the plant cell wall depends on the plant species, so there are various possible consequences of modifications of pectin metabolism in various species  <cit> .

lignification of the cell walls in stalks is also a relevant issue for retting and thus for fibre quality. flax intended for fibre production is harvested on day  <dig> of plant growth to prevent too great a degree of cell wall lignification. in order to improve the yield of flax, research is focused on generating transgenic flax plants that are more resistant to specific pathogens but characterised by unchanged or improved productivity relative to non-modified plants. studies have shown that genetically modified flax with higher contents of certain constituents also has the potential to become a source of innovative products with biomedical properties.

pathogen infections cause large loses in the yield from flax cultivation. varieties of plants that are more resistant to infection have been generated through the introduction of genes for secondary metabolite synthesis or pr genes  <cit> .

plant β- <dig> -glucanases are pathogenesis-related proteins classified as members of the pr- <dig> family. they are constitutively expressed at low levels, but their expression dramatically increases during infection. β- <dig> -glucanase hydrolyses β- <dig> -glucans, which are the main components of the cell wall of fungi. it acts in at least two different ways: directly, by degrading the cell walls of the pathogen; and indirectly, by promoting the release of cell wall-derived materials that can act as elicitors of defence reactions, stimulating the production of other pr proteins or low molecular weight antifungal compounds, such as phytoalexins  <cit> . by degrading callose, β- <dig> -glucanases are also involved in various physiological and developmental processes, namely cell elongation  <cit> , cell division  <cit> , fruit ripening  <cit> , fertilization  <cit> , pollen germination and tube growth  <cit> , bud dormancy release  <cit> , microsporogenesis  <cit> , somatic embryogenesis  <cit> , seed germination  <cit>  and flower formation  <cit> . callose is a linear homopolymer that consists of glucose residues linked by β- <dig>  binding with some β- <dig>  branches, and it is widespread in higher plants  <cit> .

recently, in order to improve the resistance of flax to pathogen infection, we generated a transgenic plant that overexpresses β- <dig> -glucanase. the resulting transgenic flax  was characterised by a threefold increase in resistance to fusarium oxysporum and f. culmorum infection. in vitro-cultivated type b plants also displayed a significant decrease in the contents of carbohydrates, fatty acids and organic acids, and an increase in the levels of selected amino acids, polyamines and antioxidants  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the constitutively expressed β- <dig> -glucanase in flax type b on the biochemical composition of the cell wall and the mechanical properties of flax fibres in order to establish the usefulness of this transgenic plant for textile and pharmaceutical production. of particular interest to us were the polysaccharide composition  and the phenolic compound contents of the flax fibres. it was also important to analyse whether the overproduction β- <dig> -glucanase could affect the quantity and the composition of the fibres obtained from the straw.

RESULTS
fibre quantity
the usability of flax fibre depends on the efficiency of the retting process. the transgenic flax line b <dig> and the non-transgenic flax line nike gave similar yields of fibre from their straw . this indicates that the overexpression of the β- <dig> -glucanase gene in flax had no influence on the quantity of the isolated fibre.

major cell wall structural components
cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin are the major structural components of the plant cell wall. cellulose, a linear polysaccharide consisting of β- <dig> -linked d-glucose units, is the core of the plant cell wall, serving as a scaffold for the other cell wall components. hemicellulose, a heteropolymer of polysaccharides, is divided into several classes: xyloglucans, glucomannans, glucuronoarabinoxylans and mixed linkage glucans  <cit> . lignins are large, complex polymers of three principal alcohols: coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl  <cit> .

the amounts of those components were determined in fibres from transgenic flax line b <dig> and a control, non-transgenic flax line . the results are presented in figure  <dig>  the cellulose content was only slightly higher in fibres from b <dig> flax. however, the lignin level was significantly lower in fibres from b <dig> flax. the pectin and hemicellulose contents were higher in the fibres of the transgenic flax than in those of the control and these differences were statistically significant.

the transgenic flax plants overexpressing the β- <dig> -glucanase gene were characterised by alterations in the composition of the cell wall. the higher cellulose content could indicate improved mechanical properties. the reduced lignin content could give better elastic properties and higher fibre flexibility. additionally, the lower degree of lignification has a positive effect on the retting process, increasing its efficiency. however, the higher pectin content may have compensated for the lower lignin content and may be the reason that the efficiency of retting process was unchanged. no in vitro experiment on straw retting was performed, but the observed field retting time for the transgenic flax did not differ from that for the control.

infra-red spectrophotometry analysis
the ir spectra of the fibres from the nike and b <dig> plants are presented in figure 3a. four characteristic ranges can be distinguished: 2500– <dig>  1400– <dig>  900– <dig> and 400– <dig> cm- <dig>  the main contours are similar to those reported for other flax fibres  <cit> . however, the relative intensities of several narrow lines that appear on the slope of these broad bands lead to an important conclusion on the chemical content of the transgenic flax. the ir spectra of the fibres from the control and genetically modified flax mainly consist of the bands that are characteristic for cellulose  <cit> .

the broad absorption band at  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponds to the stretching v mode of the free hydroxyl groups and those involved in intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds  <cit> . the shape of this band is nearly the same for all of the studied samples, but the bands differ in terms of their absorption intensity . the intensity of the contour in the range from  <dig> to  <dig> cm- <dig> clearly increases for fibres from b <dig> flax. this is probably caused by different conformations of the intra- and inter-molecular o-h···o hydrogen bonds in the b <dig> samples. the contours observed in the ir spectra of the flax fibres in the ranges 1500– <dig> cm- <dig>  1200– <dig> cm- <dig> and 950– <dig> cm- <dig> are typical for flax cellulose with some amounts of lignin and pectin. the bands in these multiplets can be assigned to the vibration of δas at  <dig> cm- <dig>  δs at about  <dig> cm- <dig>  δ at  <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig>  v and v in the range 1200– <dig> cm- <dig>  δ at  <dig> cm- <dig>  vas in the range 1000– <dig> cm- <dig>  γ in the range 850– <dig> cm- <dig>  and δ in the range 500– <dig> cm- <dig>  the spectrum in the 1200– <dig> cm- <dig> range consists of a strong multiplet that is characteristic of in-plane bending vibrations of the hydrogen bond, δ. integral intensities of the component at  <dig> cm- <dig> increase for fibres from b <dig>  relative to fibres from nike, suggesting an increase in the hydrogen bond number in the transgenic fibres. other bands at  <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig> respectively correspond to the δ + δ and δas vibrations. the comparison of the integral intensities of these bands gives the following relationships: for the  <dig> cm- <dig> band ib <dig> fibres > inike fibres  and for the  <dig> cm- <dig> band ib <dig> fibres > inike fibres . the band at about  <dig> cm- <dig> was described as cellulose and hemicellulose absorbance. its integral intensities are higher for fibres from b <dig>  than for those from nike. the bands at  <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig> originate from the v vibrations of the β- <dig> -glycosidic bond of the cellulose chains. the integral intensities analysed for these bands show the trend ib <dig> > inike. this difference is  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . the weak band at  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponds to vibrations of cellulose. the integral intensity for this band is slightly higher for fibres from b <dig> than for those from nike . the integral intensities of the band at  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponding to the γ vibration also change  <cit> . they are higher for fibres from b <dig> . all these data suggest a higher amount of cellulose and hemicellulose in fibres from b <dig> than in those from nike, which agrees with a chemical analysis data.

the ir bands in the 1800– <dig> cm- <dig> range may be used to identify the changes in the pectin content in the fibres from the control and transgenic flax. ir spectra in this range can be deconvoluted into three lorentzian components. the component at about  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponds to the vas vibrations of the unconjugated carboxyl group of pectin. the integral intensity of this band fulfils the relationship inike fibres < ib <dig> fibres, showing that transgenic flax b <dig> exhibits higher contents of pectin. this difference comes to  <dig> % . the position of the band at  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponds to the vas vibration of the conjugated carboxyl group  <cit> . its intensity slightly increases for fibres from transgenic flax. the third band, which appears at about  <dig> cm- <dig>  corresponds to the vs vibrations of the carboxyl group present in pectin. the strongest integral intensity is observed for fibres from b <dig> flax. the difference comes to  <dig> % . these data show that the content of pectin increases in fibres of transgenic flax line b <dig> 

the ir bands in the 1300– <dig> cm- <dig> range may be used to identify the changes in lignin content in the fibres from the control and transgenic flax. it can be deconvoluted into four lorentzian components. the components at about  <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig> correspond to lignin vibrations  <cit> . the integral intensities of these bands decrease for b <dig> fibres  suggesting a decrease in the lignin content in the b <dig> fibres . useful information can be obtained by comparing the integral intensities of the band observed at about  <dig> cm- <dig>  which corresponds to v  vibration. the intensities of this band fulfil the relationship ib <dig> fibres < inike fibres. these data show that the lignin content is lower in the flax fibres of transgenic line b <dig> than in those from the control flax confirming the results obtained by chemical analysis.

mechanical properties
overexpression of β- <dig> -glucanase did not significantly alter the essential mechanical characteristics of the retted fibres, including their tensile strength, tensile stiffness, energy to break and relative extension at break . however, a statistically non-significant reduction was observed in young’s modulus and the energy to break for fibres from transgenic flax line b <dig> relative to the values for the control, non-transgenic flax.

despite some changes in the carbohydrate and lignin contents, the effect of introducing the β- <dig> -glucanase gene on the load-bearing performance of the fibre cell wall and thus that of the retted fibres was rather negligible. that may be explained by the compensating impact of the various biochemical changes observed in the transgenic plants.

uronic acid content in the cell wall fractions
during fractionation of the cell wall material, three fractions of pectin were obtained: the water-soluble fraction ; the cdta-soluble fraction ; and the na2co3-soluble fraction . two fractions of hemicellulose were also obtained: the  <dig> m koh-soluble fraction  and the  <dig> m koh-soluble fraction . the content of uronic acids  was determined using spectrophotometry, as described in the methods section. the data are presented in figure  <dig> 

the results obtained from the three fractions of pectin  revealed an increase in the uronic acid content in the fibres of transgenic line b <dig> compared to the values for the non-transgenic flax fibres. statistically significant changes were observed in the csf and nsf, whereas only a slight, non-significant increase was detected in the wsf. galacturonic acid is the main component of pectic polysaccharides, so the csf, which contains the highest amount of galac , can be called the key fraction of a flax pectin.

the data obtained for the two hemicellulose fractions revealed a significant decrease in the uronic acid content in fibres from transgenic flax line b <dig> in k1sf and a significant increase in the fibres from transgenic flax in k4sf compared to the values for the control fibres.

monosaccharide composition in cell wall fractions
the monosaccharide compositions of the three fractions of pectin  and the two fractions of hemicellulose  were analysed by uplc. figure  <dig> shows the statistically significant increase in glucose content in the three fraction of pectin in the fibres of transgenic line b <dig> relative to the contents for the control fibres the amount of galactose, the other major sugar, is increased in all the pectin fractions, but these changes were statistically insignificant. the only other sugar significantly changed in wsf fraction was ribose present however on a very low level. the more significant changes were observed for csf fraction where increase in mannose and arabinose and decrease in xylose were found statistically significant. for nsf fraction statistically significant increase in mannose and xylose and lowering of rhamnose was observed.

similarly the increase in glucose content was observed in hemicellulose fractions however those changes were statistically significant only for k1sf fractions. the mannose contents were significantly higher and rhamnose, arabinose and ribose significantly lower in k1sf fraction of the fibres from transgenic flax. a statistically significant increase in xylose and fucose content was found in the hemicellulose k4sf of the fibres of transgenic line b <dig> relative to the values for the non-transgenic plants. there were noticeable similarities in the changes in the contents of particular monosaccharides in the pectin and hemicellulose fractions. to better illustrate the changes in a pectin and hemicellulose composition the molar participation of particular monosaccharides in the pectin and hemicellulose fractions was calculated and is presented in table  <dig>  there are some significant differences between the monosaccharide composition of all of the fractions in the fibres of transgenic line b <dig> and the composition of the fibres of the control flax, mostly coinciding with the data presented as the quantity of monosaccharides . the most notable exception is in mannose whose molar ratio to other sugars is not statistically changed in all fractions except k1sf even though its general level is increased. the strongest and statistically significant changes in composition are observed for fractions nsf and k4sf. the data also confirmed that csf is the main fraction of pectin, because its galacturonic acid content is higher than the content of other monosaccharides. k1sf and k4sf contain a considerable amount of xyloglucans compared to the pectin fractions.

the amount of mol of the studied monosaccharides to  <dig> mol of monosaccharides in the cell wall fractions  for fibres from transgenic flax line b <dig> and the non-transgenic control flax nike. man – mannose, rha – rhamnose, glc – glucose, xyl – xylose, ara – arabinose, fuc- fucose, rib – ribose, gal – galactose and galac – galacturonic acid. data represents the mean values ± sd from three independent experiments. the significance of the differences between the means was determined using student’s t test .

flax fibre callose content
callose contents were determined using spectrofluorometry with β- <dig> -glucan as the standard for preparing the calibration curve. the callose content was reduced in the fibres from transgenic flax b <dig> relative to that of the control flax fibres. the difference in the compound content came to 20% and was statistically significant .

phenolic acid, phenolic aldehyde and vitexin contents in the cell wall fractions of the cell wall
phenolic acids , phenolic aldehydes  and vitexin  were detected in all of the cell wall fractions after alkaline hydrolysis, which indicated an ester bond with the monosaccharides that compose the pectin and hemicelluloses in the cell wall . a statistically significant increase in the contents of vanillin, ferulic acid and vitexin, and a statistically non-significant increase in the contents of vanillic acid, coumaric acid and syringic aldehyde were detected in the csf of the fibres from transgenic line b <dig> compared to the values for the control flax fibres. slightly reduced levels of vanillic acid, coumaric acid and syringic aldehyde and slightly increased levels of ferulic acid, vanillin and vitexin were found in the wsf of the fibres from the transgenic flax. a significantly lower level of vanillic acid and syringic aldehyde and a lack of changes in the levels of the rest of phenolic compounds were detected in the nsf from the transgenic flax. the levels of all of the phenolic compounds with the exception of vitexin increased significantly in the hemicellulose k4sf and slightly in the hemicellulose k1sf of the fibres from transgenic flax compared to the levels for the non-transgenic plants. in the k1sf, the increases for coumaric acid, ferulic acid and vitexin were statistically significant.

uplc determination of the vanillic acid, coumaric acid, ferulic acid, vanillin, syringic aldehyde and vitexin contents in the cell wall fractions  for fibres from transgenic flax line b <dig> and non-transgenic control flax nike. analyses were performed as described in the methods section. data represents the mean values ± sd from three independent experiments. the significance of the differences between the means was determined using student’s t test .

the content of phenolic compounds expressed as mmol per  <dig> mol of monosaccharides in the various cell wall fractions are shown in table  <dig>  giving a sense of the stoichiometry of the components of the analysed fractions. the highest level of phenolic compounds was measured in the hemicellulose k1sf in both the transgenic and control fibres. the calculated molar stoichiometry of phenolics and monosaccharides reveals that the hemicellulose k4sf accumulates a statistically significant excess of phenolic compounds detected in transgenic fibres. vanillin and vanillic and phenolic acids were predominantly detected in this fraction. since the monosaccharide content of the k4sf from both of the analysed fibre types differs mainly in terms of the xylose content, we speculate that this sugar unit is predominantly esterified by phenolic acids in the transgenic fibre. however, this needs to be verified.

the amount of mmol of the studied phenolic compounds  to  <dig> mol of monosaccharides in the cell wall fractions  for fibres from transgenic flax line b <dig> and non-transgenic control flax nike. data represents the mean values ± sd from three independent experiments. the significance of the differences between the means was determined using student’s t test .

antioxidant activity
the antioxidant activities of particular cell wall fractions were determined using the dpph method. the free radical  <dig> -diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl  is scavenged by antioxidants, and the percentage of inhibition could be measured as the decrease in absorbance at  <dig> nm. the scavenging activity of the pectin and hemicellulose fractions at a concentration of  <dig> mg/ml was compared with that of commercially available pectin at the same concentration . the antioxidant activity of commercial pectin was the lowest . the percentage of inhibition of free radicals for the three pectin fractions  was between  <dig> and 15%. the antioxidant potential for transgenic fibre b <dig> was lower than that of the control, but these changes were statistically insignificant. the highest antioxidant potential was observed for the k1sf: from 23% inhibition for the control fibres and 27% for the b <dig> transgenic fibres. the k4sf displays an increase in antioxidant activity for the transgenic flax fibre  relative to the control flax fibre . these data indicate that the hemicellulose k1sf has the best antioxidant potential, which correlates with the phenolic compound content .

discussion
flax  is a valuable source of oil rich in omega- <dig> fatty acids  and fibres containing antioxidant compounds. flax fibres are mainly used by the textile industry, but the presence of valuable bioactive compounds means there is potential for biomedical applications as wound dressings and sutures  <cit> .

the production of high-quality flax fibres is limited by several factors, such as plant productivity, the efficiency of straw processing  and the contents and stoichiometry of biopolymers . the productivity of flax depends on abiotic  and biotic  factors. in our previous study, in order to improve productivity, flax plants with overexpression of the β- <dig> -glucanase gene were generated and characterised by the increase in resistance to fungal infection  <cit> . this effect was expected because β- <dig> -glucanase is responsible for the hydrolysis of β- <dig> -glucans, the main compound of the fungal cell wall  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to assess the fibres of fourth generation plants of this transgenic line that had been field-cultivated on a semi-technical scale in the  <dig> growing season. the rationale behind the study was that fibre polysaccharides determine the technological properties of fibres and their industrial usefulness. β- <dig> -glucanase is capable of endogenous β- <dig> -glucan  degradation and glucose derivatives are the main constituents of fibre polysaccharides, so the transgenic plants should display different properties.

there were no changes in the fibre yield from the transgenic flax that overproduces β- <dig> -glucanase compared to the yield from the control plants. however, there were significant differences in both the quantity and quality of the main biopolymers that constitute the fibre. the genetic modification resulted in a slight increase in the cellulose content, a statistically significant increase in the pectin and hemicellulose contents, and a decrease in the lignin content in the fibres.

the biochemical data were confirmed by the ir analysis of the fibres. the integral intensities of the successive bands were assessed and differences in the cellulose, pectin, hemicellulose and lignin contents were found. the bands responsible for hydrogen bonds and thus polymer arrangement were also analysed. fibres from the transgenic b <dig> line were characterised by a rise in band intensity in the  <dig> to  <dig> cm- <dig> range, resulting from different conformations of the intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds in the cellulose. also, the integral intensity of the  <dig> cm- <dig> band was higher for b <dig> flax, suggesting an increase in the number of hydrogen bonds in the cellulose. thus, the overexpression of the β- <dig> -glucanase gene results in changes to the cellulose polymer organization, namely their closer packing in the fibres. one possible reason for the comparable fibre strength of the control and transgenic plants was the only slight change in the cellulose content. however, the reduced level of lignin affects the elastic properties of the fibre. the flexibility of fibres from the b <dig> line was elevated, as indicated by the lower young’s modulus. additionally, lignin plays a very important role during fungal infection. it is known that an increase in lignin content gives a higher resistance to fungal attacks  <cit> . however, some studies yielded results that indicate that plants are more resistant to fungal infection in spite of the reduced lignin content  <cit> .

significant changes in the pectin and hemicellulose contents observed in the fibres of the transgenic flax indicated the need for a detailed analysis of these polysaccharides, including an assessment of the monosaccharide composition and the phenolic acid content. the quantitative and qualitative contribution of pectin to the construction of the plant cell wall depends on the developmental stage  <cit>  and the plant species  <cit> . the monosaccharide analysis revealed a higher content of galacturonic acid in all of the pectin fractions in the fibres from the transgenic flax, with the highest result in the csf. moreover, the fibres from b <dig> flax were characterised by a significant increase in the glucose content and an increase that was not always significant in the mannose and rhamnose content in all of the pectin fractions. therefore, this genetic modification not only increased the quantity of pectin, but also changed its constituents. a similar tendency was observed in the two hemicellulose fractions from the fibres. significantly elevated contents of glucose and mannose in the k1sf and xylose in the k4sf but slightly reduced contents of rhamnose and galactose in both fractions were detected in the fibres from the transgenic plants. there is a marked galacturonic acid content reduction in the hemicellulose k1sf in the transgenic plants.

the changes in pectin and hemicellulose composition  are even better illustrated when molar ratio of participating sugars were calculated giving a clearer picture of stoichiometry of forming units. what is mostly visible is statistically significant increased percentage of glucose and insignificant increase in galactouronic acid content with decrease of contribution of all other sugars in pectin fractions. in case of hemicelluloses increase in glucose percentage is observed only for k1sf fraction. the increase in the content of predominant monosaccharides is noteworthy, particularly the significantly elevated glucose content, which raises questions about the underlying molecular mechanism. we reasoned that β- <dig> -glucanase hydrolyses β- <dig> -glucans not only from the fungal cell wall, but also flax callose, an endogenic β- <dig> -glucan. since the level of callose was reduced in the fibres from transgenic line b <dig> relative to the levels for the control fibres, we speculate that the excess of glucose units could be used as substrate for the synthesis of other wall polymers   <cit> . the detailed analysis of the wall constituents revealed significant differences in the content of phenolic compounds bound with the pectin and hemicellulose fractions. three phenolic acids , two phenolic aldehydes  and one flavonoid  were identified in the pectin fractions isolated from fibres. the total content of phenolic compounds in the fibres from the transgenic plants was about 26% higher than in the fibres from the control plants. of the wall fractions that were analysed, csf and k4sf were characterised by a significant increase in the contents of most of the phenolic compounds. in k4sf, this is probably caused by the increase in xylose content in the transgenic flax fibres, as it was reported that phenolic acids bind preferentially to arabinoxylans  <cit> . in the remaining fractions, the quantities of particular compounds were different and depended on the fraction and the compound analysed.

the obtained results were reflected in the antioxidant properties of particular fractions. the highest antioxidant potential was shown by the k1sf of the fibres from the transgenic flax. it is worth noting that regardless of the similar quality of phenolic compounds in the wsf, nsf and k4sf, the hemicellulose fraction displayed the lowest ability to inhibit the reactive form dpph•. it is speculated that besides the phenolic compound contents, the proper composition and structure of pectin might also affect the antioxidant properties  <cit> . it is interesting to note that the antioxidant activity of all of the wall fractions from flax fibres was statistically higher than that for commercially available pectin. the results confirmed that flax fibre pectin is potentially more beneficial than commercial citrus pectin and indicated the possibility of its biomedical application.

CONCLUSIONS
fibres from flax plants overexpressing the β- <dig> -glucanase gene have an altered wall biopolymer composition. the contents of particular polysaccharides  were higher, but reduced lignin content was also observed. a decrease in the content of callose, which is a substrate for β- <dig> -glucanase, was also found. it is thus suggested that the glucose units released from the callose are redirected to the production of other polysaccharides. the increase in the contents of monosaccharides, the main component of hemicellulose, is accompanied by an accumulation of phenolic compounds in this fraction. the reason for this accumulation is unknown.

the antioxidant potential of the pectin fractions could be predicted from the amount of phenolic compounds. the fibres from transgenic plants showed a higher antioxidant potential than those from the control plants, which suggests their potential usefulness as biomedical products.

in summary, this study shows for the first time that the β- <dig> -glucanase gene is involved in plant polysaccharide and lignin metabolism and establishes its benefits in the production of improved flax fibres.
