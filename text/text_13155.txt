BACKGROUND
comfrey belongs to the family boraginaceae. three plant species in the genus symphytum contribute to the crop known as comfrey, symphytum officinale l. , s. asperum lepechin , and s. x uplandicum nyman . symphytum officinale l. is a tall perennial with large hairy leaves and small purple flowers  <cit> . comfrey has been used as an herbal medicine for more than two thousand years for the treatment of broken bones, tendon damage, ulcerations in the gastrointestinal tract, and lung congestion, as well as for wound healing and/or reducing joint inflammation when it is applied externally  <cit> .

in addition to essential nutrients, comfrey also contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids . pas are constituents of over  <dig> plants, and many of them are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic in humans and animals  <cit> . in the liver, pas are transformed to pyrroles by the mixed-function oxidases. pyrroles exert their toxic effect by reacting with cellular macromolecules, including proteins and dna  <cit> . therefore, comfrey's therapeutic use might increase the risk of liver toxicity. many countries including canada, germany, and the uk, have restricted its availability. in  <dig>  the us food and drug administration requested voluntary compliance for the removal of products containing comfrey  <cit> .

the major hepatotoxic manifestation in humans ingesting comfrey is the hepatic veno-occlusive lesion   <cit> , also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome   <cit> . comfrey is also carcinogenic in rats, which suggests the potential tumorigenic effects of the plant  <cit> . hepatocellular adenomas were induced in rats receiving a diet containing comfrey. feeding rats comfrey leaves produced a dose-dependent reduction in survival and an increase in liver tumor incidence  <cit> . comfrey roots are much more toxic than the leaves.

in a previous study, we developed evidence indicating that the liver tumors induced by feeding rats 2% comfrey root were generated by a genotoxic mechanism and that the pas in the plant were responsible for mutation induction and tumor initiation in rat liver  <cit> . considering the fact that rats tolerate diets containing up to 33% comfrey leaves and 8% comfrey roots for relatively long periods of time   <cit> , in the present study, we evaluated the mutagenicity of 8% comfrey root. using a toxicogenomic approach, we analyzed the changes in global gene expressions in the liver of rats following comfrey-treatment.

RESULTS
growth curve of rats fed with 8% comfrey root
male big blue transgenic rats were fed with 8% comfrey root for  <dig> weeks. the mean body weight of the comfrey-fed rats was less than that of the vehicle controls throughout the study . rats fed with comfrey weighed 5%, 23%, and 35% less than the control rats after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> weeks of the study, respectively, and displayed little weight gain after  <dig> weeks of feeding with comfrey.

mutant frequency  in the liver cii gene of comfrey-fed rats
the results of cii mf analyses in the comfrey-fed and control rats are shown in figure  <dig>  dna from each liver was packaged 2– <dig> times either to confirm the mf or to obtain a minimum of  <dig> ×  <dig> plaque-forming units for mutant detection. the mf for rats fed with 8% comfrey was  <dig> ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which was similar to the mf previously detected in 2% comfrey-fed rats  <cit>  and significantly increased over the control group .

mutation spectrum in the liver cii gene from comfrey-fed rats
comfrey-induced mutations in the liver cii gene were evaluated by dna sequence analysis of  <dig> mutants isolated from  <dig> rats fed a diet containing 8% comfrey root. since mutations that were found more than once among the mutants isolated from a single animal were assumed to be siblings and to represent only one independent mutation, a total of  <dig> independent mutations were identified. table  <dig> summarizes the types of cii mutations observed in the livers of rats fed 8% comfrey compared with mutation spectra of control and 2% comfrey-fed rats that we reported previously  <cit> . the overall pattern of mutations in 8% comfrey-fed rats differed significantly from controls , but did not differ from 2% comfrey-fed rats. among the independent mutations, about 85% from both the comfrey-treated and control rats were base pair substitutions. g:c → t:a transversion  was the major type of mutation in the 8% comfrey-fed rats, whereas g:c → a:t transition was the predominant mutation in the controls. in addition, a 13% frequency of tandem base substitutions was observed among the mutations from the 8% comfrey-fed rats. the 8% comfrey-fed rats had more large deletions than control rats, although the percentages of frameshift mutations were the same.

gene expression regulated by comfrey-treatment
in order to determine gene expression changes associated with comfrey exposure, we employed the genome survey microarray, which contains  <dig>  verified rat genes. we isolated total rna from the livers of  <dig> control and  <dig> comfrey-fed rats. for the purpose of visualizing the data, the intensities of the whole rat gene data were analyzed by principal components analysis within arraytrack . it demonstrates that one array of sample  <dig> from the control group appears to be quite different from the rest of the arrays, which was further identified as an outlier array by the pearson's correlation coefficient of pair-wise log <dig> intensity correlation . this outlier was excluded from further data analysis. a separation between control and comfrey-treated groups was clearly observed, suggesting that there was a clear comfrey-treatment effect on liver gene expression . to select significant genes, minimum requirements were established for both a two-fold change in the gene expression compared to the controls and a p-value less than  <dig>  for the difference. a total of  <dig>  genes satisfied the requirements;  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and  <dig>  genes were down-regulated in response to comfrey treatment . among the regulated genes,  <dig>  were identified by ingenuity pathway analysis. in this study, we focused on genes involved in metabolism, injury of endothelial cells, and liver injury and abnormalities.

genes associated with drug metabolizing genes
since the pas in comfrey require metabolic activation to exert their biological effects, we investigated the gene expression changes of drug metabolizing genes. we observed the up- or down-regulation of many cytochrome p <dig> genes , glutathione s-transferases , atp-binding cassette transporters , and other metabolism-associated genes, including nadh oxidoreductase  and aldehyde dehydrogenase . table  <dig> shows the significant changes in gene expression related to phase i, ii, and iii drug metabolizing genes.

genes involved in injury of endothelial cells
considering the involvement of sinusoidal endothelial cells and sometimes hepatic venular endothelial cells in vod/sos  <cit> , we focused on genes expressed in endothelial cells. table  <dig> summarizes the alteration of genes related to cell death, apoptosis, and cell growth of endothelial cells. for example, we observed the up-regulation of previously reported tumor necrosis factors , transforming growth factor , and other genes   <cit> . several novel genes were responsive to comfrey treatment, including activating transcription factor  <dig> , b-cell cll/lymphoma  <dig> , caspase  <dig> , mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> , and secreted phosphoprotein  <dig> .

genes involved in liver injury and abnormalities
endothelial damage can lead to hepatocellular injury, and fibrotic reaction in the sinusoids is characterized as the later stages of vod/sos. chronic comfrey treatment also resulted in the induction of a number of genes involved in liver injury and abnormalities. significantly changed genes were divided into subsets based on functionality, and categories included cell death, growth, fibrosis, morphology, and liver cancer development . sixteen genes were functionally categorized in liver cell death. besides the tumor necrosis factors and transforming growth factor, comfrey treatment resulted in strong up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a  and heme oxyenase  <dig> , as well as down-regulation of epidermal growth factor  and ccaat/enhancer binding protein beta . of note, genes involved in cell growth were up-regulated along with the genes involved in liver cell death, such as cyclin e <dig> , hepatocyte growth factor , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig> .

liver fibrosis is the hallmark of all chronic liver diseases, irrespective of their origin. ingenuity pathway analysis showed that sixteen significantly regulated genes appeared to have a role in liver fibrosis . most of them encode cytokines , angiogenic molecules , chemokines and their receptors , coagulation cascade genes , and cytoskeletal molecules . moreover, eight genes related to the development of liver cancer were among the most discriminating genes involved in cancer development, such as growth arrest and dna damage inducible  <dig> alpha , b-cell cll/lymphoma  <dig> , n-myc downstream regulated  <dig> , and xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group c .

discussion
comfrey was one of the most popular herbal teas in the world, including the united states. although its popularity has declined due to the understanding of its dangers, it is still available commercially in several forms. the regular use of comfrey is a potential health risk owing to the presence of pas. comfrey contains as many as nine pas, including acetyl intermedine, acetyl lycopsamine, echimidine, intermedine, lasiocarpine, lycopsamine, symlandine, symphytine, and symviridine  <cit> . the pa content of comfrey is less than 1% and depends on the plant part  <cit> . higher pa concentrations occur in the roots of comfrey than in the leaves, and commercially available comfrey tablets containing high levels of pas are likely to be derived from comfrey roots  <cit> . pas are the leading plant toxins associated with disease in humans and animals.

several cases of vod/sos associated with comfrey ingestion have been reported in humans  <cit> , as well as in experimental animals  <cit> . deleve and her colleagues  <cit>  have developed a reproducible animal model of hepatic vod, in which the rats are gavaged with a single dose of pa, monocrotaline. the model exhibits the characteristic clinical and histological features of hepatic vod, including the earliest manifestations , early vod , and late vod   <cit> . comfrey and the specific alkaloids in comfrey  induce hepatoadenoma and hemangioendothelial sarcomas in rats  <cit> . the mechanisms by which toxicity and carcinogenicity are produced are still not fully understood. gene expression profiling offers a powerful approach for identifying differentially expressed genes and identifying mechanisms.

gene expression was markedly affected  in the livers of rats exposed to 8% comfrey root, a dose that resulted in significant decreases in body weight  and increases in liver mf . out of  <dig>  genes evaluated, the expression of  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes were altered more than 2-fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively. at p-values of  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes, respectively, displayed a significant effect after comfrey-treatment compared to control group. in this study, differential gene expression was considered significant for genes showing at least a 2-fold up- or down-change, and a p <  <dig> . in total,  <dig>  genes  satisfied the requirements and about half of them were down-regulated and half up-regulated in response to comfrey exposure . such a large number of significantly altered genes may partly reflect the therapeutic effects of comfrey exerted through plant components other than pas  <cit> . in the present study, we concentrated on the analysis of genes involved in metabolism, injury of endothelial cells, and liver injury and abnormalities.

liver is the major organ for biotransformation of xenobiotics and drugs. pas are metabolically activated to toxic, alkylating pyrroles by mixed-function oxidases. the cytochrome p <dig>  superfamily contains  <dig> genes and plays a critical role in the phase i metabolism of a variety of xenobiotics including drugs, carcinogens, steroids and eicosanoids  <cit> . in the present study, comfrey exposure resulted in changes in the expression of  <dig> cyp genes . among phase i, ii, and iii drug metabolizing genes, cyp2c <dig>  cyp7a <dig>  cyp <dig>  gsta <dig>  and abcc <dig> were increased 6-21-fold. in contrast, cyp2c, cyp39a <dig>  gstm <dig>  abcc <dig>  and others were reduced in the comfrey-treated livers. it is known that many herbal/dietary constituents form reactive intermediates capable of irreversibly inhibiting various cyps . the resultant metabolites lead to cyp inactivation by chemical modification of the heme, the apoprotein, or both, as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the apoprotein. phase ii consists of conjugating enzymes, such as glutathione s-transferases , udp-glucuronosyltransferases , and sulfatases. gsts also participate in oxidative stress release pathways. the altered expression of phase i and phase ii enzymes along with altered drug transport proteins  could contribute to the increased susceptibility of rats to carcinogenic chemicals, such as comfrey.

sinusoidal endothelial cells are more susceptible than hepatocytes to pas that cause vod/sos  <cit> . functional annotation extracted from ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that many of the transcriptional responses were associated with the apoptosis, cell death, adhesion, and cell movement of endothelial cells . the genes in these pathways were highly expressed in comfrey-treated livers; these genes included the endothelial cell markers plasminogen activator inhibitor type  <dig>  and tissue plasminogen activator , and the cytokine tumor necrosis factors , and transforming growth factors . induction of a number of genes involved in the injury of endothelial cells was also detected, including endothelin  <dig> , urokinase plasminogen activator receptor , collagen type iv alpha  <dig> , matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> , mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> , and secreted phosphoprotein  <dig> . it has been reported that edn <dig> is a mediator of hepatic sinusoidal constriction, and increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases is responsible for changes of sinusoidal endothelial cells  <cit> . elevated plasma pai- <dig> levels are useful in distinguishing vod/sos  <cit> . endothelial injury is the initiating event in the cascade of events leading to the hepatic changes and clinical manifestation of vod/sos  <cit> . our results offer a more comprehensive overview of the molecular responses to comfrey exposure by expression of multiple genes in liver endothelial cells.

pas in comfrey can reach the hepatocytes via the sinusoidal blood, and their toxic metabolites lead to immediate damage to the hepatocytes  <cit> . genes involved in liver cell death and growth were also induced or repressed in response to comfrey treatment , including tumor necrosis factors, transforming growth factor β, chemokine receptor ccr <dig> gene , heme oxygenase  <dig> , immediate early response  <dig> , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , inhibin beta a , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig> . it is well known that hmox <dig> induction is a protective mechanism against the oxidative stress associated with liver injury  <cit> , and that elevated hgf could protect hepatocytes from injury or promote hepatocellular regeneration  <cit> . since inhba, so-called activin a, is a negative regulator of hepatocyte cell growth  <cit> , the decreased expression of inhba observed after comfrey treatment suggests the induction of hepatic growth.

necrosis of hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells follows comfrey-induced liver cell injury, and functional cells are replaced by fibrotic tissues  <cit> . in the present study, we observed  <dig> genes involved in the function of liver fibrosis by ingenuity pathway analysis . liver fibrosis is characterized by cell proliferation and the accumulation of extracellular matrix components and is mediated by cytokines and growth factors, of which tgf-β <dig> appears to be a key mediator  <cit> . the up-regulation of cytokines hgf and tnfrsf <dig> and down-regulation of igf <dig> and lif play an important role in the pathogenesis of liver injury and fibrosis. decreased serum igf- <dig> levels provide a useful index of hepatocellular dysfunction and impaired nutritional status, and increased hgf appears to limit liver fibrosis  <cit> . agt and agtr1a, cytokines with vasoactive properties, also regulate liver fibrogenesis. chemokines have a much wider biological role including angiogenesis, carcinogenesis, and cell cycle control  <cit> . chemokines in the liver  may modulate the progression of liver fibrosis through their actions on hepatic stellate cells.

pa-induced dna damage in the liver , if not repaired prior to dna synthesis, might produce replication errors and mutations, which eventually could result in the development of neoplasmas in the treated animals. we determined mfs in the liver cii gene of big blue transgenic rats. after feeding with 8% comfrey root for  <dig> weeks, we observed a 4-fold higher mf in the liver cii gene compared to the controls . the induction of mutation was similar to that reported previously for rats fed with 2% comfrey root  <cit> . these observations suggest that the rats could not tolerate the feeding of roots in concentrations over 2%, in terms of mutation induction. furthermore, the overall pattern of mutations induced by 8% comfrey in liver was similar to that in the livers of rats fed 2% comfrey root , whereas both the 2% and 8% comfrey-induced mutation spectra were significantly different from liver controls. in contrast to the g:c → a:t transition that was the predominant mutation in the controls, the major type of mutation in the 8% comfrey-fed rats was g:c → t:a transversion , a mutation that was also induced by riddelliine, a representative genotoxic pa that is tumorigenic for rat liver  <cit> . in addition, 13% of mutations from the 8% comfrey-fed rats were tandem base substitution, which has been suggested as a mutational signature for the genetic damage of pas  <cit> . g:c → t:a transversion may cause the initiation of tumors in the liver of rats fed with comfrey, because it has been reported that more than half of riddelliine-induced liver hemangiosarcomas have a g → t mutation at k-ras codon  <dig>  <cit> . p <dig> mutation also has been detected at an early stage of riddelliine exposure  <cit> . mutations are thought to be involved in carcinogenesis because the transition from a normal somatic cell to a cancer cell is due to mutations in protooncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and/or genes that function in the maintenance of genomic stability  <cit> . comfrey-induced neoplasms in the rat were mostly found in the liver. hepatocellular adenomas were induced in all experimental groups that received diets containing 1–8% comfrey root or 8–33% comfrey leaves. in addition, a few rats bearing hepatocellular adenomas simultaneously had hemangioendothelial sarcoma of the liver  <cit> . the first hepatocellular carcinoma  appearance was  <dig> months after initiating the 8% comfrey diet.

ingenuity pathway analysis found  <dig> genes  involved in liver cancer development that were altered due to comfrey treatment . in mammals, the nucleotide excision repair process is the most important repair pathway for elimination of dna damage caused by exogenous agents, including uv light, dna-reactive carcinogens, and some endogenously generated oxidative lesions  <cit> . xeroderma pigmentosum group c  is implicated in the early steps of this repair pathway. a significantly higher incidence of chemically induced liver and lung tumors is observed in xpc null mice  <cit> . gap junction membrane channel protein beta  <dig> , also called connexin  <dig> , is the main gap junction protein in hepatocytes and plays an important role in the regulation of signal transfer and growth control in the liver. it has been reported that cx <dig> expression decreases gradually as liver disease progresses to cirrhosis and hcc  <cit> , and a low expression of cx <dig> mrnas in hcc tissues is also predictive of the postoperative recurrence of hccs  <cit> . bcl- <dig> is characterized as an antiapoptotic/oncogenic protein and also functions as an antioxidant. increased bcl- <dig> expression in cirrhotic patients correlates with the development of hcc  <cit> . bcl- <dig> is also expressed in hcc tissues and the increasing bcl- <dig> expression associated with hcc progression suggests that the bcl- <dig> protein takes part in the formation of hcc  <cit> . hgf, identified originally as the most potent mitogen for hepatocytes, is now known to be a cytokine with numerous functions in a wide variety of cells  <cit> . it is up-regulated in inflammatory liver diseases and stimulates dna synthesis preferentially in initiated hepatocytes, presumably resulting in tumour promotion  <cit> . n-myc downstream-regulated gene  <dig>  plays a role in growth arrest and cell differentiation, is induced by several stress conditions, and is overexpressed in many cancers  <cit> . expression of ndrg <dig> was significantly up-regulated in hcc tissues compared to that of noncancerous and normal liver tissues  <cit> . cyclin e , a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  is an important regulator for entry into the s phase of the mammalian cell cycle. overexpression of ccne <dig> has been observed in many tumors including primary hccs  <cit> ; overexpression results in chromosome instability and thus may contribute to tumorigenesis  <cit> . growth arrest and dna damage  <dig> alpha  is a nuclear protein involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, dna repair, and the suppression of cell growth  <cit> . gadd45a protein levels are higher in liver cirrhotic and neoplastic tissues  <cit> . tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig>  is a contributory factor to fibrosis of a variety of organs including the liver. timp <dig> and other extracellular matrix remodeling genes are implicated in the transition from mild to moderate fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis c  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the integration of gene expression changes with a mechanistic pathway analysis suggests a scheme for comfrey treatment leading to tumorigenesis via mutation induction . the available evidence suggests that active metabolites of pas in comfrey interact with endothelial and hepatocyte dna, causing damage to hepatic endothelial cells and hepatocytes. this may result in liver fibrosis and increases in mutation induction, which may be associated with the development of hcc and hemagiosarcoma. we have identified  <dig>  genes in the livers of comfrey-fed rats that were differentially expressed. some of the gene changes are associated with the metabolism, injury of endothelial cells, and liver injury and abnormalities that are postulated to occur as a result of comfrey exposure. this approach provides further insight into the mechanisms involved in the development of vod/sos and tumorigenesis after exposure to comfrey.

materials and methods
plant material and animals
comfrey roots  were purchased from camas prairie products . male big blue fisher  <dig> transgenic rats were obtained from taconic laboratories  through purchase from stratagene . all animal procedures followed the recommendations of the nctr institutional animal care and use committee for the handling, maintenance, treatment, and sacrifice of the rats.

comfrey diet and treatments
the comfrey roots were ground into powder using a wiley mill, and the comfrey root powder was stored at room temperature until use. nih- <dig> pellets  were autoclaved and ground into meal form. the base diet was blended with comfrey root powder in a hobart mixer to make 8% comfrey root dosed diet, which was provided in rat feeders. the treatment schedule was based on the protocol used in a carcinogenesis assay  <cit> . male, 6-week-old big blue rats were fed without  or with 8% comfrey roots for  <dig> weeks. six rats from each treatment group were sacrificed at the end of the treatment. the livers were isolated, frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°c.

cii mutation assay
high-molecular-weight genomic dna was extracted from rat livers using the recoverease dna isolation kit  and stored at 4°c until dna packaging was performed. the packaging of the phage, plating the packaged dna samples, and determination of mf were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions for the λ select-cii mutation detection system for big blue rodents . the shuttle vector containing the cii target gene was rescued from total genomic dna with phage packaging extract . the plating was performed with the escherichia coli host strain g <dig>  to determine the total titer of packaged phages, g <dig> bacteria were mixed with 1: <dig> dilutions of phage, plated on tb <dig> plates, and incubated overnight at 37°c . for mutant selection, the packaged phages were mixed with g <dig>  plated on tb <dig> plates, and incubated at 24°c for about  <dig> h . under these conditions, phages with wild-type cii genes undergo lysogenization and become part of the developing bacterial lawn, whereas phages with mutated cii genes undergo lytic growth and give rise to plaques. when incubated at 37°c, phages with wild-type cii genes also undergo a lytic cycle, resulting in plaque formation. assays were repeated until a minimum of  <dig> ×  <dig> plaque-forming units from each sample were examined for mutation. the cii mf is defined as the total number of mutant plaques  divided by the total number of plaques screened .

sequence analysis of the cii mutants
the mutants were sequenced according to the method of mei et al.  <cit> . the cii mutant plaques were selected at random from different animals and replated at low density to verify the mutant phenotype. single, well-isolated plaques were selected from these plates and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing  <dig> μl of sterile distilled water. the tube was heated at 100°c for  <dig> min and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min. the cii target dna for sequencing was amplified by pcr using primers 5'-aaaaagggcatcaaattaacc-3'  and 5'-ccgaagttgagtatttttgctg-3' . for pcr amplification,  <dig> μl of the supernatant were added to  <dig> μl of a pcr master mix  and the primers. the final concentrations of the reagents were: 1× taq polymerase reaction buffer,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig> μm of each dntp,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  and  <dig>  u of taq dna polymerase. the pcr reactionwas performed using a pcr system  <dig> , with the following cycling parameters: a  <dig> min denaturation at 95°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 95°c,  <dig> min at 60°c, and  <dig> min at 72°c, with a final extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr products were isolated using a pcr purification kit . the cii mutant dna was sequenced with a ceq dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and a ceq  <dig> genetic analysis system . the primer for cii mutation sequencing was the upstream primer used for the pcr.

statistical analyses for mutagenicity data
analyses were performed using the sigmastat  <dig>  program . all of the mf data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation  from  <dig> rats per group. statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance  followed by the holm-sidak test. mutational spectra were compared using the computer program written by cariello and colleagues  <cit>  for the monte carlo analysis developed by adams and skopek  <cit> .

rna isolation and quality control
total rna was isolated from liver tissues of  <dig> control and  <dig> comfrey-fed rats using an rneasy system . the yield of the extracted rna was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the optical density at  <dig> nm. the purity and quality of extracted rna were evaluated using the rna  <dig> labchip and agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . rna samples with rna integrity numbers  greater than  <dig>  were used for microarray experiments performed using applied biosystems' rat genome survey microarray platform, which is a one channel microarray with chemiluminescence detection, and contains  <dig>  probes  for the interrogation of  <dig>  genes and  <dig> controls that track system performance through each experiment.

preparation of digoxigenin labeled in vitro transcribed crna
all rna targets were labeled using the applied biosystems rt-ivt labeling kit version  <dig> . briefly,  <dig>  μg of total rna was reverse transcribed via  <dig> h incubation at 42°c with arrayscript rt enzyme  and oligo dt-t <dig> primer. double stranded cdna was produced following  <dig> h incubation with e. coli dna polymerase and rnase h at 16°c. double-stranded cdna was purified according to the rt-ivt kit protocol. in vitro transcription was performed by incubation of the cdna product with t <dig> rna polymerase,  <dig>  mm digoxigenin-11-utp  and all other ntps for  <dig> h. labeled crna was purified according to the rt-ivt kit protocol and analyzed for quality and quantity using standard uv spectrometry and the bioanalyzer.

hybridization of labeled crna to microarrays and microarray imaging
digoxigenin labeled crna targets were hybridized to applied biosystems rat whole genome survey microarrays using the applied biosystems chemiluminescent detection kit. briefly,  <dig> μg of labeled crna targets were fragmented via incubation with fragmentation buffer provided in the kit for  <dig> min at 60°c. fragmented targets were hybridized to microarrays during a  <dig> h incubation at 55°c with buffers and reagents from the chemiluminescent detection kit. post-hybridization washes and anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase binding were performed according to the protocol of the kit. chemiluminescence detection, image acquisition and analysis were performed using applied biosystems chemiluminescence detection kit and applied biosystems  <dig> chemiluminescent microarray analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols. images were auto-gridded and the chemiluminescent signals were quantified, corrected for background, and finally, spot- and spatially-normalized using the applied biosystems  <dig> chemiluminescent microarray analyzer software version  <dig> .

microarray data analysis
gene expression data from the applied biosystems' rat genome survey microarray were input to arraytrack, a software system developed by the fda's national center for toxicological research for the management, analysis, visualization and interpretation of microarray data  <cit> . raw microarray intensity data were normalized per chip to the same median intensity value of  <dig>  chemiluminescent signals from  <dig> control probes that track system performance through each experiment were not used in normalization. the identification of differentially expressed genes based on t-tests and fold-change cutoffs, and principal component analysis were conducted within arraytrack. ingenutity pathway analysis  was used for pathway and function analysis.
