BACKGROUND
the mechanisms by which organisms survive extreme low temperatures are not only of interest to ecologists, but also to a number of applied medical fields  <cit> . in this respect, one of the most amenable and studied groups of organisms is the collembola  where the physiological processes behind such survival are well documented  <cit> . they possess three main strategies to survive the cold: freeze tolerance, freeze avoidance or protective dehydration  <cit> . whilst most springtails use freeze avoidance, it is the latter strategy of protective dehydration in the arctic springtail onychiurus arcticus  which is the subject of this study  <cit> . in protective dehydration loss of water occurs across a diffusion gradient between the animal's super-cooled body fluids and ice in its surroundings, such that freezing point depression always exceeds the environmental temperature experienced, and eventually the animals lose sufficient water to ensure that a freezing event cannot occur  <cit> ; the animals desiccate. o. arcticus is widely distributed throughout the northern parts of the palaearctic region  <cit>  and is found in moist habitats; mainly in mosses and under large stones in the coastal areas of svalbard, particularly on glacial outwash fans and under bird cliffs  <cit> . studies have shown that o. arcticus, exposed to sub-zero temperatures and low water vapor pressure induces extensive dehydration through a highly permeable cuticle  <cit> . this is combined with the rapid synthesis and accumulation of the membrane/protein cryoprotectant trehalose from glycogen  <cit> .

whilst there are a number of physiological and ecological studies on this organism , there have been no molecular analyses to date . this situation is not unusual, as the number of organisms where there is even moderate amounts of sequence data are severely limited. however, genomics is being increasingly applied to the study of non-model organisms and ests are generally viewed as the most efficient and cost effective strategy for the identification of genes and generating a first pass scan of a genome  <cit> .

as part of a larger project examining over-wintering strategies in polar arthropods, we have generated  <dig>  ests for o. arcticus from  <dig> cdna libraries of animals in different desiccation states. in this article we present the analysis of these library data. this represents the first sequence data for this organism and significantly increases the number of collembolan ests in the databases from the previous total of  <dig>  produced from the springtail folsomia candida  <cit> .

RESULTS
cdna libraries construction and characterisation
five libraries were produced from both desiccating and re-hydrating populations of o. arcticus from stages that had previously been defined as potentially informative for molecular analyses  <cit> .

• library c: controls

• library d1: desiccating: animals at -2°c. this is the critical temperature at which trehalose is significantly up-regulated at the expense of stores of glycogen.

• library d2: fully desiccated animals.

• library r1: animals that had been recovering for  <dig> hours.

• library r2: fully recovered animals.

for more detail, see methods. a total of  <dig>  clones were sequenced from the 5' direction. this was reduced slightly to  <dig>  clones after quality checks, each of which had a minimum transcript size of  <dig> bp and an average of  <dig> bp. each library proportionally contributed between  <dig> and 23% of the total est dataset . the libraries were normalised to optimise the chances of obtaining rare transcripts. indeed, both gene diversity and discovery ratios were high in all libraries, with a minimum diversity score of 79%  and even the largest clusters comprising only approximately  <dig> % of any one library . when sequence similarity searches were run on the processed sequences, on average 40% produced significant matches  against the sequence databases. this level of gene identification is not surprising and recent est data generated from the springtail folsomia candida  produced similar levels of blast identity. this is largely because there are a limited number of insects that have been sequenced. the two main insects in the ensembl database  <cit>  are drosophila melanogaster and anopheles gambiae, which are only related to o. arcticus at the super class level . of the two, a. gambiae has most recently been sequenced and the vectorbase genome build from june  <dig>  produced only 10% known genes from a  <dig> fold genome sequence coverage of  <dig> mb. similarly recent est data  from the silkworm  only provides confirmation of 15% of the predicted genes from the wgs project  <cit> .
general statistics for all libraries individually and combined. * reads that are submittable and > <dig> bp. ** threshold for blastx significance = 1e- <dig>  gene discovery is defined as the number of different "genes" each library contributed, divided by library size. gene diversity is defined as the number of singletons in each library divided by library size  <cit> .

the sequences from each library were further processed using blast2go  <cit> , but showed very similar compositions when defined in terms of their molecular function . an example of this output is shown for all libraries in figure  <dig>  with the majority of clones having either catalytic or binding activities. although the libraries were normalised, gossip  <cit>  was used to perform statistical analyses using pair-wise comparisons of each library with the control library to identify any potential enrichment for particular genes or gene functions. no enrichment was found using the corrected p-values of the false discovery rate, although there were a number of significant single test p-values. for example go016860: intramolecular oxidoreductase activity and go008237: metalloexopeptidase activity were both elevated in the desiccated library compared to the control with single test p-values of  <dig> , these were not significant using the false discovery rate. the problem with such pair wise comparisons is that even though the comparative library was always the control animals, the go categories listed for each pair wise comparison varied considerably and it was not possible using this technique to make global statements of certain molecular functions being statistically enhanced in one library compared to the others. these data do indicate that the normalisation procedure in the library production process was relatively effective.

go annotation
the decision was made to analyse the libraries using go annotation rather than keyword extraction from blast comment lines, as go categories are more generic than gene names. this facilitates the comprehensive identification of gene sets associated with biochemical pathways without in-depth knowledge of individual pathway components and also where potentially multiple pathways exist for a particular process . in the following discussion pgo refers to a biological process go annotation; fgo is molecular function and cgo is cellular component.

initially the focus of the searches concentrated on general processes such as response to water, water deprivation, abiotic stimulus, desiccation and qdrought recovery. disappointingly only  <dig> clones were identified from the five libraries, but even so, these did include some clones of further interest. pgo: <dig>  response to water deprivation identified a putative aquaporin  and pgo: <dig>  response to water, produced ests with matches to dehydrin which is induced in response to water stress in plants, the latter of which would not have been identified using extraction of blast keyword data. given the relative lack of success of the generic searches, specific genes and pathways were targeted. of the genes present in the libraries, there was particular interest in identifying the following genes:

• the trehalose and glycogen pathways   <cit> .

• aquaporins:  <dig> transmembrane domain proteins involved in water transport  <cit> .

• genes involved in cell protection, such as antioxidants

• genes involved in moulting, as moulting has previously been implicated in lowering the supercooling point and survival ability of antarctic springtails   <cit> .

• lea  proteins, which have been shown to be involved in desiccation in a number of organisms  <cit> .

trehalose and glycogen pathways
initially the trehalose pathway was screened only for the go molecular functions directly associated with it, but this revealed very few matching clones, with only  <dig> clones for fgo: <dig>  activity, none for fgo:  <dig>  and  <dig> for fgo: <dig>  . because of the redundancy in levels of go annotation, all six clones identified by the molecular processes matched the same gene: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase . a similar situation occurred when identifying genes involved in the glycogen pathway, in that a number of clones were identified , but many were to the same gene: glycogen phosphorylase which breaks up glycogen into glucose subunits.

further analysis was carried out on the trehalose pathway by expanding the search to the biological process pgo: <dig> . this produced  <dig> matches in total. in-depth analysis of these revealed matches to trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, trehalase precursor and a number of different protein kinases . these included a serine-threonine protein kinase from the yellow fever mosquito, which in humans is involved in phosphorylation and protein kinase a camp-dependant catalytic subunit from the same organism. phosphorylation is an integral process in trehalose biosynthesis and degradation, so protein kinases are certainly involved. the question is, which ones? the go annotations, whilst largely based on mammalian data, provide immediate candidates for further analysis, which would not have been identified using screening of blast outputs using specific keywords for the trehalose pathway enzymes. it is interesting to note that libraries produced from control animals did not contain any matches to trehalase activity, which is associated with the breakdown of trehalose. however, this is to be expected as biochemical studies indicate that trehalose is largely absent in control animals and that it is only produced in response to the desiccation process  <cit> . also that the libraries prepared from the desiccated animals contained the highest number of potential matches to trehalose synthesis go annotations, which is where it is expected that most trehalose would be produced.

aquaporins
these proteins are associated with water transport across membranes  and have the go annotation: fgo:0015250: water channel activity. searches of all libraries revealed  <dig> clones in total  matching three potentially different aquaporin genes:

• q0ig28: aquaporin  <dig> from aedes aegypti. two clones from control and desiccating libraries , matches in excess of p value =  <dig>  expect value =  <dig> e- <dig> 

• q9nhw7: aquaporin aqpae.a from aedes aegypti. two clones from desiccated and recovering libraries , matches in excess of p value =  <dig>  expect value =  <dig>  e-47

• uniref <dig> 000051a00b: predicted similar to drip cg9023_pb isoform b apis mellifera.  <dig> cluster of  <dig> genes from the desiccated library  with a match of p value =  <dig>  expect value =  <dig>  e-44

translation of the individual clones and alignments confirmed that three different aquaporin genes had been cloned  with a maximum of  <dig> % amino acid identity between clones when compared over identical lengths . the clones were all around  <dig> amino acids in length, which is approximately 80% of the expected length of an aquaporin gene. all clones included  <dig> complete transmembrane  domains with tm <dig> present in sb_006_05h <dig> and partial in the two other clones. all three contained the classical footprint of aquaporins: two npa motifs, cysteine  <dig> was not conserved and only cl <dig> had the consensus site for n-linked glycosylation. the consensus site for phosphorylation by protein kinase c was not present in any of the clones  <cit> . homology between the clones was relatively low at a maximum of  <dig> %, but not surprising as homology within aquaporins is generally low. for example the maximum homology between the latest aquaporin identified in mouse  with the other mouse aqps is  <dig> %  <cit> . when the  <dig> bp sequence from exon  <dig> of the gene for aquaporin- <dig> was compared in  <dig> mammalian species, only  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acids were conserved throughout the mammalian aquaporin family, of these  <dig> were conserved in the springtail aqps . identity of the springtail clones was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis . all three clones clustered with the other insect aquaporins extracted from the database. interestingly all insect clones clustered more strongly with the aquaglyceroporins, aqp <dig>  the putative ancestral molecule  <cit>  and aqp  <dig> and  <dig>  relatively little is known about the latter two genes, but the human aqp <dig> is hypothesised to play a novel intracellular role in digestive enzyme secretion  <cit> . limited functional analysis has been carried out on the insect aquaporins, but evidence points toward them being designated as classical water channel molecules  <cit> . cicadella viridis aqpcic has been shown to increase osmotic membrane water permeability when expressed in xenopus oocytes and the aedes aegypti aqp  gene was localised to tracheolar cells associated with malpigian tubules and therefore it was hypothesised that this protein played a role in the removal of tracheolar fluid during respiration.

cell protection
a general search for the level  <dig> go annotation fgo: <dig> revealed  <dig> potential clones with antioxidant activity from all  <dig> libraries. however because of the complexity of the go annotation network, further searches were carried out for level  <dig> molecular functions and biological processes under specific functions: hydrogen peroxide, melanin, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase . these identified a greater number of clones , many of which were duplicated between the libraries . it is interesting to note that the highest number of antioxidant clones were present in both the desiccating and desiccated libraries . from the percentages of clones present in each library for each antioxidant, the major components would appear to be glutathione, catalase and hydrogen peroxidase, with melanin and superoxide dismutase playing minor roles.

moulting
processes involved in the survival of insects at low temperatures include the removal or deactivation of ice nucleating agents, accumulation of cryoprotectants and thermal hysteresis proteins  <cit> . moulting has recently been shown to be associated with reduction of the supercooling point  and hence cryoprotection in antarctic springtails   <cit> . this might be expected to depress the scp, because in collembola the mid-gut and its entire contents are shed during moulting  <cit>  resulting in the expulsion of potential ice nucleators in the animal gut. the physiology and timing of moulting in o. arcticus has not been documented to date, although with a rigid exoskeleton they clearly moult regularly in order to grow. so genes and pathways involved in moulting were also investigated using go annotations . a number of relevant genes were identified for both juvenile hormone  and members of the ecdysone pathway. the latter included the ecdysone receptor and the protein ultraspiracle  chorion factor. in addition to a considerable number of putative transcription factors and chromatin remodelling subunits were identified. it was interesting to note that more matches were found in the actively desiccating  and recovering animals   compared to only  <dig> in the control and  <dig> in the desiccated populations. thus indicating that moulting may either play a role in the desiccation process, or potentially is triggered in some animals by the cellular stress involved in desiccation and recovery. we are currently investigating the role of moulting in desiccation of o. arcticus using a biochemical test for 20-hydroxy ecdysone and are also actively collecting animals that have either just moulted or are in the process of moulting for more detailed molecular analysis.

lea proteins
of the genes and pathways under investigation, only lea proteins were without go annotations. so a search was made of the ests using blast annotations. identification of leas is problematical as these proteins are not highly conserved  <cit> . comparison of lea proteins between different species reveals only  <dig> % identity between two cereal crops , which reduces dramatically to  <dig> % between different phyla such as chick pea and nematode . even the  <dig> amino acid repeat unit, which is a feature of leas shows little conservation with only  <dig> or  <dig> identical amino acids between chick pea and the nematode aphelenus avenae. searches of the o. arcticus blast annotations revealed a cluster of two clones present in library d <dig>  and a single clone in library d <dig> . this is exactly where such genes would be expected if they were involved in the desiccation process. translation of all three clones and alignments indicated that only one gene was present. the primary blast match results for this clone against the databases were to q1dh <dig>  a putative uncharacterised protein from the yellow fever mosquito. after a number of subsequent matches to uncharacterised insect proteins, there were then matches to abhydrolase genes and lea proteins  with probability and expect scores for the latter of  <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> . at the amino acid level, identities were low with the best match to the uncharacterised protein showing 45% identity and the lea protein, 31%.

database searches of lea proteins can produce matches to abhydrolase genes , due to the presence of an abhydrolase domain . abhydrolases are a largely uncharacterised protein family, but members of this family do contain domains with hydrolase activity and therefore could potentially be involved in desiccation biochemistry. phylogenetic analysis of the o. arcticus translated gene fragment suggests that this fragment most closely matches the abhd_a  abhydrolase domain . the question remains, is this clone sb_009_02e <dig> an lea or an abhydrolase? this is virtually impossible to answer with short sequence fragments and the answer may become apparent with the full-length sequence, the cloning of which by race pcr is now underway. also western blotting studies are being carried out on o. arcticus using heterologous probing of a lea antibody to identify such proteins via an alternative route.

differences between the libraries
all libraries were normalised during the construction process and therefore in-depth expression analysis was difficult. the primary aim of this est production was to produce clones for a microarray and therefore normalisation was considered the best option for maximising gene discovery. however, lack or gain of gene expression could be inferred by presence or absence in some libraries. certainly some go annotations revealed similar distributions and levels of function across all libraries. but where very specific enzyme reactions or genes were identified some differences between libraries could be discerned using a plus/minus system cf. aquaporins and putative leas, as discussed above . the identification of candidate genes for involvement in the desiccation process and some generalised differential expression between libraries has to be further verified using more comprehensive laboratory analyses such as race pcr to obtain full-length clones, microarrays and q-pcr.
differences between the libraries for specific clones.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper describes, for the first time, est data from the arctic springtail , significantly enhancing the number of collembolan ests in the public databases. 40% of the clones produced significant matches against swissprot and trembl and these ests were further analysed using go annotations. this facilitated the identification of genes involved in biochemical pathways of interest, such as trehalose biosynthesis and moulting. the go annotations produced a greater range of potential "genes" for further investigation and was more effective at identifying genes in a particular pathway than could have been identified using extraction of data from blast. candidate genes involved in the desiccation process were identified including three members of the aquaporin family and a putative lea protein. these genes are under further investigation. the go annotations identified in this publication will be used to automatically extract est clone ids from in-house produced insect libraries to target further investigations into over-wintering survival of insects in extreme environments. this will include construction of customised microarrays.
