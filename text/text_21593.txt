BACKGROUND
rhizobium-legume symbiosis represents the most important nitrogen-fixing mechanism, which may have the potential to increase nitrogen input in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. however, biotic , and abiotic  constraints limit legume crop production in arid and semi-arid lands, which are often located in developing countries  <cit> . both drought and salinity impose osmotic stress, as a result of large concentrations of either salt or non-ionic solutes in the surrounding medium, with the resulting deficit of water  <cit> . the rhizobium-legume symbiosis is highly sensitive to osmotic stress. therefore strategies to improve the symbiosis efficiency and legume production under this constraint should target both symbiotic partners, together with appropriate crop and soil management  <cit> .

rhizospheric rhizobia are subjected to frequent fluctuations in the osmolarity of their environment due to the succession of drought and rain periods, the exclusion of salts like nacl from root tissues, the release of plant exudates, or the production of exopolymers by plant roots and rhizobacteria. in addition, rhizobia must also adapt to the osmotic situation during the infection process and in a nodule exchanging nutrients with the host plant  <cit> . therefore, besides symbiotic efficiency, osmotolerance may constitute a competitive trait for either native or inoculant rhizobia, in order to persist in drought/salt-affected soils, and/or after the process of seed coat-mediated desiccation, and maybe to improve the colonization and/or infection process.

one of the main mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to hyperosmotic conditions is the intracytoplasmic accumulation of low molecular-weight organic osmolytes  <cit> . these molecules are termed compatible solutes because they do not interact with macromolecules in detrimental ways  <cit> . compatible solutes are accumulated either by uptake from the environment  or by de novo biosynthesis . the diversity of compatible solutes is large but falls into a few major chemical categories, such as sugars , polyols , amino acids and derivatives , betaines and ectoines  <cit> . it is very common for microorganisms to use a cocktail of compatible solutes, a strategy that allows the cell to adapt the compatible solute pool to different environmental injuries. indeed, the role of compatible solutes goes beyond osmotic adjustment alone, to protection of cells and cell components from freezing, desiccation, high temperature and oxygen radicals  <cit> . on the other hand, hypoosmotic adaptation in gram-negative bacteria, including the rhizobiaceae, involves the accumulation of periplasmic cyclic glucans, which appear to contribute substantially to periplasmic osmolarity  <cit> .

among the rhizobiaceae, the best studied species regarding osmoadaptation is sinorhizobium meliloti one of the most common alfalfa microsymbionts. specific concomitant accumulation of potassium and glutamate was found to be the primary response in s. meliloti to hyperosmotic stress  <cit> . out of four potassium uptake systems found within the s. meliloti genome, trk was shown to be the most important k+ importer involved in the osmoadaptation of this bacterium  <cit> . by using 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , it was shown that s. meliloti long term response to hyperosmotic stress involves the synthesis and accumulation of the dipeptide n-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide and the disaccharide trehalose, the latter one specially when cells are subjected to severe osmotic stress  <cit> .

trehalose is a non-reducing glucose disaccharide that is widespread in nature. it protects numerous biological structures against abiotic stresses including desiccation, oxidation, heat, cold, dehydration, and hyperosmotic conditions  <cit> . recently, the importance of trehalose in osmotolerance and nodulation of their legume hosts by s. meliloti  <cit>  and bradyrhizobium japonicum  <cit>  has been firmly established. trehalose has shown to play also a major role in desiccation tolerance of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <cit> .

common bean  is an important staple crop in the diets of people of latin america, asia, africa, and other regions of the developing world. paradoxically, despite common bean is a promiscuous legume able to form symbioses with a number of rhizobial species including r. tropici, r. etli, r. gallicum, r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli or r. giardinii  <cit> , it is considered as a poor nitrogen fixer, if compared to other grain legumes  <cit> . this problem has been attributed to the ineffectiveness of indigenous rhizobia  <cit>  or to adverse abiotic conditions  <cit> . in a recent work, suarez et al.  <cit>  reported an increase in root nodule number and nitrogen fixation by p. vulgaris cv. negro jamapa  inoculated with a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase-overexpressing strain of r. etli. thus, manipulating trehalose metabolism in p. vulgaris looks a promising strategy to improve plant tolerance to osmotic stress and grain yield. compared to this body of knowledge on the osmoadaptation of these agronomically important rhizobacteria, little is known about the osmostress responses of rhizobial strains nodulating common bean in africa. the purpose of the work described here was threefold. first, we used 13c-nmr to compare the osmoadaptive responses of three effective rhizobium strains isolated from root nodules of p vulgaris grown in tunisian fields under rainfed conditions  <cit>  with that of the reference strain r. tropici ciat 899t, a latin american isolate that has been shown to tolerate several abiotic stresses, including high temperature, low ph, or salinity  <cit> . despite a number of r. tropici ciat  <dig> osmosensitive mutants has been characterized, none of them was affected in compatible solute synthesis  <cit> . in fact, the complete set of compatible solutes in this strain was unknown previously to this work. second, we aimed to determine the osmoadaptive mechanism of agrobacterium sp. 10c <dig> , which was isolated from the same tunisian common bean fields as the above strains  <cit> . agrobacterium sp. 10c <dig> could not nodulate p. vulgaris per se, but it was able to colonize pre-formed p. vulgaris nodules  <cit>  and to modulate, either positively or negatively, nodulation of common beans by native rhizobia  <cit> . third, we focused on trehalose, which we found as the major compatible solute in the four rhizobium strains. we determined the trehalose content of the strains and traced its biosynthetic pathway both molecularly and biochemically. collaterally, the β- <dig> -cyclic glucan from r. tropici ciat  <dig> was co-extracted with the cytoplasmic compatible solutes when cells were grown at low salinity, and its chemical structure was determined by using a suite of one-dimensional and two-dimensional nmr spectra and mass spectrometry.

RESULTS
strain identity and phylogeny
strains r. gallicum bv. gallicum 8a <dig>  r. etli 12a <dig>  agrobacterium sp. 10c <dig> and r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> were previously isolated by mhamdi et al.  <cit>  from nodules of p. vulgaris grown on neutral soil samples collected from north tunisia. a preliminary strain affiliation was made upon rflp analysis of the 16s rrna, nodc and nifh genes  <cit> , and partial sequence of the 16s rdna and blast search for homologous sequences . to confirm the identity and phylogenetic position of the strains, we sequenced their nearly complete 16s rdna figure  <dig> shows the phylogenetic tree constructed using the neighbor-joining method based on these sequences and those of closely related rhizobia obtained from genebank. strains r. etli 12a <dig>  r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig>  and agrobacterium sp. 10c <dig> grouped with the r. etli, r. gallicum and a. tumefaciens type strains. on the basis of its phylogenetic relatedness to the type strain of a. tumefaciens, we propose strain agrobacterium sp. 10c <dig> to be named as a. tumefaciens 10c <dig>  r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> was in the same cluster as the type strains of r. leguminosarum bvs. trifolii and viciae, but in a separate branch. interestingly, the type strain of r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, was in a separate group, close to the r. etli type strain. this lack of clustering between the type strains of r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli and the other two biovars of r. leguminosarum was previously reported  <cit> , and it was proposed that r. phaseoli should be retained as a separate species.

differences in halotolerance of the strains
as a previous step to investigate the compatible solute content of the local and reference strains, we selected a suitable minimal medium for their growth and determined their tolerance to nacl. growth was tested in two chemically defined minimal media  with two different carbon sources . cell yield  showed that r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> grew better in m79-i with glucose, r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> and r. etli 12a <dig> in m79-i with mannitol, and r. tropici ciat  <dig> and a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> in mas with mannitol . subsequently, cells were grown in  <dig> ml of their optimal minimal media containing increasing nacl concentrations up to  <dig> mm nacl. cultures were incubated at 28°c and growth was monitored up to the stationary phase. the most salt-tolerant strain was a. tumefaciens 10c <dig>  which grew well in mas medium containing  <dig> mm nacl and displayed optimal growth at  <dig> mm nacl . a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> growth was totally impaired at  <dig> mm nacl . the second most nacl-tolerant strain was r. tropici ciat  <dig>  which grew well in mas medium containing up to  <dig> mm nacl and showed optimal growth at  <dig> mm nacl. strains r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig>  r. etli 12a <dig> and r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> were the most salt sensitive ones, showing optimal growth in basal m79-i medium with no extra salt added. r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> was slightly more salt-tolerant than r. etli 12a <dig> and r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig>  growth of these three strains was severely impaired over  <dig> mm nacl .

analysis of major intracellular solutes
the differences found in salt tolerance of the strains prompted us to investigate and compare their compatible solute content. for this purpose, we analyzed cellular extracts by using 1h- and 13c-nmr. the 13c-nmr spectrum of r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> grown in mannitol m79-i medium with  <dig> mm nacl contained three sets of chemical shifts that were assigned to the disaccharide trehalose , the sugar alcohol mannitol  and the amino acid glutamate  . trehalose and mannitol, but not glutamate, were also majoritarily found in extracts from strain r. etli 12a <dig> cultivated in mannitol m79-i medium with  <dig> mm nacl . the identity of these three compatible solutes was confirmed by 1h-nmr analysis of extracts from the two strains .

when grown in mas medium with  <dig> mm nacl in the presence of mannitol, r. tropici ciat  <dig> spectrum displayed three sets of resonances that could be assigned to trehalose, mannitol and glutamate, and a fourth set of six sugar carbon resonances  that could not be initially assigned to any known compound . however, the presence of a signal with a chemical shift above  <dig> ppm, indicated β configuration of a glucose unit. when the salt concentration was raised up to  <dig> mm nacl in the same medium, only chemical shifts due trehalose and glutamate were observed, whereas those corresponding to mannitol and the unknown sugar were not detected . trehalose, mannitol, and an unknown minoritary sugar showing a similar resonance pattern as the unidentified compound found in r. tropici ciat  <dig>  were detected in the 13c-nmr spectra of r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> grown in m79-i medium with  <dig> mm nacl and mannitol . however, mannitol was not accumulated in r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> cultivated in the same medium with glucose as a carbon source , suggesting that mannitol accumulation depends on its transport, rather than synthesis, in this strain.

trehalose content of the rhizobial strains
as the four rhizobium strains which accumulated trehalose displayed different salt tolerance, we investigated if there was a correlation between their intracellular trehalose content and their tolerance to salinity. for this purpose, trehalose was quantified colorimetrically from cells grown up to early stationary phase in their optimal minimal medium with  <dig>  m  or  <dig>  m nacl  nacl. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  intracellular trehalose content of strains r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig>  r. etli 12a <dig> and r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> grown at  <dig>  m nacl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μmol/mg protein. at the same salinity, cells of the more salt-tolerant r. tropici ciat  <dig> accumulated ca.  <dig>  μmol of trehalose per mg of protein, but they displayed a  <dig> -fold higher trehalose content when they were grown at  <dig>  m nacl, suggesting that trehalose accumulation in this strain is osmoregulated. however, even at  <dig>  m nacl trehalose levels of r. tropici ciat  <dig> were equivalent to those of the more salt-sensitive strains r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> and r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> grown under their nacl limiting conditions . the above data suggest that there is not a direct correlation between trehalose content of the strains and their salt tolerance. in addition, they suggest that, although trehalose accumulation in r. tropici ciat  <dig> is osmoregulated, trehalose alone cannot account for the higher halotolerance of r. tropici ciat  <dig> 

isolation and phylogenetic analysis of the otsa gene
since all rhizobium strains tested synthesized trehalose, we were interested to check if this occurs through the otsa-otsb pathway. this very well conserved route involves the transfer of glucose from udp-glucose to glucose-phosphate to form trehalose-6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase . then, a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase  dephosphorylates this intermediate to produce trehalose  <cit> . the otsa genes of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <cit> , s. meliloti  <cit> , r. etli  <cit>  and b. japonicum  <cit>  have been recently isolated. to check the presence of otsa in the genome of the rhizobium strains, we designed oligonucleotides covering two very well-conserved regions and amplified the corresponding genes from genomic dna of the selected strains. single pcr products of ca.  <dig> kb were obtained from genomic dnas of r. etli 12a <dig>  r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> and r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> , and r. tropici ciat  <dig> . as expected, a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> dna was not amplified with any of the two otsa primer pairs.

the aligned otsa proteins were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, and the resulting tree is shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, the otsa proteins from r. tropici ciat  <dig>  r. etli 12a <dig>  r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> and r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> grouped with otsa proteins of α-proteobacteria, but some incongruencies were found. for example, r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> otsa was more related to the otsa proteins of sinorhizobium  than to those of r. etli or r. leguminosarum. in addition, r. etli 12a <dig> otsa did not cluster with r. etli cfn  <dig> otsa but with the otsa proteins from r. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 31c <dig> and r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii. from the above results, we suggest that the otsa-otsb pathway may be involved in trehalose synthesis in all strains tested.

synthesis of trehalose by r. tropici ciat  <dig> from different carbon sources
the results presented so far indicated that trehalose is synthesized from mannitol-derived glucose via the otsa-otsb pathway in the four rhizobium strains tested. we were interested to know if trehalose could be also synthesized from other carbon sources. for this purpose, r. tropici ciat  <dig> was grown in  <dig>  m nacl mas with glucose, galactose, mannose and mannitol and the accumulated compounds were analyzed by 1h nmr. figure 8a-d shows that whereas the unknown sugar  was synthesized from any of the tested carbon sources, trehalose was only accumulated when glucose, galactose or mannitol, but not mannose, was present in the culture medium.

to elucidate if the synthesis of trehalose by r. tropici ciat  <dig> involves the transformation of mannitol to one or both of the trehalose glucose units, or a full degradation of the carbon source followed by a synthesis de novo, this strain was grown in  <dig>  m nacl mas medium with 1-13c-mannitol as carbon source, and the cellular extracts were analyzed by 1h spectroscopy. as shown in figure 8e, only resonances corresponding to the c <dig> and c <dig> carbons of the glucose units of trehalose and the unknown sugar, as well as those of the c1/c <dig> of mannitol, could be observed. in contrast, the three signals corresponding to glutamate were 13c-labelled. these findings indicate that the two glucose moieties of trehalose, as well as the unknown sugar units, were derived directly from mannitol, whereas glutamate synthesis occurred de novo, after complete mannitol degradation.

the unknown sugar accumulated by r. tropici ciat  <dig> at low salinity is a cyclic -β-glucan
initially, the six remaining resonances in the 13c-nmr spectrum of cellular extracts from r. tropici ciat  <dig> grown at low salinity could not be assigned to any known compatible solute . to determine the structure of this unknown sugar, we took advantage of the fact that r. tropici grown in the presence of mannose does not synthesize trehalose, which could interfere in the identification of this compound. thus, cells of r. tropici were grown in mas medium containing  <dig> mm mannose as a carbon source, and the unknown sugar was identified by using a set of 1h-nmr, cosy, noesy, hsqc, hmbc and ms experiments. first, in the 1h spectrum, a doublet at  <dig>  ppm  was unequivocally assigned to the anomeric hydrogen of a β-glycoside unit. second, the combination of the cosy and noesy spectra  and the 1h-13c hsqc spectrum permitted the assignment of all proton and carbon signals in the compound . third, the hmbc experiment confirmed a 1→ <dig> link between two monosaccharide, unsubstituted, molecules . finally, the mass spectrum showed a peak at m/z  <dig> corresponding to ++, from which we could deduce a molecular weight of  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> β-glucopyranose units. on the basis of this result, the structure of the compound was established as a cyclic -β-glucan formed by  <dig> β-glucopyranose units . this compound had been previously described as an extracellular glucan secreted by r. tropici ciat  <dig>  <cit> . our results clearly indicate that, as expected, the r. tropici ciat  <dig> cyclic -β glucan is also cell-associated.

a 1h and 13c signals were referenced to internal tetramethylsilane.

discussion
in this work, we investigated the osmoadaptive mechanisms used by four native rhizobia isolated from root nodules of p. vulgaris cultivated in north tunisia  <cit> . strains r. etli 12a <dig>  r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> and r. leguminsarum 31c <dig> are potentially good inoculants as they were infective and showed efficient nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with p. vulgaris  <cit> . in addition, agrobacterium 10c <dig> was able to colonize preformed p. vulgaris nodules  <cit>  and to specifically favour nodulation by some local strains  <cit> , suggesting that it might be used as co-inoculant. our results confirm the strain affiliations proposed by mhandi et al.  <cit> . in addition, on the basis of its phylogenetic relatedness to the a. tumefaciens type strain, agrobacterium 10c <dig> is proposed in this work to be renamed as a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> 

as shown by 13c- and 1h-nmr analyses, the long-term response of the four rhizobium strains to nacl involved the accumulation of trehalose, mannitol and glutamate; but the latter one was only observed in r. leguminsarum 31c <dig> and r. tropici ciat  <dig>  the reason why glutamate was not present in the extracts of r. gallicum bv. phaseoli 8a <dig> and r. etli 12a <dig> is unknown. it might be that glutamate is accumulated in these strains only during the early osmostress response, as the most commonly used charge counterbalance for k+ influx  <cit> , but it is subsequently replaced by trehalose. this was previously demonstrated in s. meliloti by gouffi et al  <cit> . on the other hand, mannosucrose and glutamate were the main osmolytes in a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> grown at high salinity, whereas at low salt only mannitol was observed. mannosucrose accumulation was found to be nacl-dependent in a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> , a tumefaciens strains c <dig> and nt <dig>  <cit>  and in rhizobial isolates from acacia nodules  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that this compatible solute participates in alleviating osmotic stress. however, isolation and analysis of osmosensitive mutants would be necessary to prove the latter statement, and additional mechanisms involved in a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> osmoadaptation cannot be ruled out.

in the tested strains, mannitol was not accumulated when glucose was used as a carbon source . on the other hand, cells grown with mannitol as a carbon source accumulated mannitol, indicating that mannitol was not synthesized de novo but accumulated upon transport from the external medium. bacteria rarely synthesize mannitol as a compatible solute, but it is frequent to find it as an external osmoprotectant  <cit> . in general, uptake and accumulation of osmoprotectants is preferred over the synthesis of endogenous compatible solutes, as the latter is energetically more costly  <cit> . however, r. tropici ciat  <dig> and a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> used mannitol both as carbon source and as an osmoprotectant solute at low salinity, but mannitol was replaced by endogenous compatible solutes  when cells were exposed to hyperosmotic stress . this finding may be explained by two, non-exclusive, reasons:  that trehalose and mannosucrose are better osmolytes than mannitol, and/or  that energy-requiring systems, other than trehalose or mannosucrose synthesis, were operating at high salinity, and mannitol catabolism was enhanced in detriment of its accumulation.

the role of trehalose as a compatible solute involved in bacterial tolerance to osmotic stress has been widely demonstrated in the literature. thus, e. coli  <cit> , s. meliloti  <cit>  and b. japonicum  <cit>  mutants lacking the otsa gene for the synthesis of trehalose are osmosensitive. in another study, alarico et al.  <cit>  found a direct correlation between the presence of genes for trehalose synthesis  in thermus thermophilus strains and their halotolerance. in this work, we found that trehalose synthesis in r. tropici ciat  <dig> is osmoregulated , suggesting the involvement of trehalose in the osmotolerance of this strain. however, we could not find a direct correlation between the trehalose content of the rhizobial strains and their osmotolerance. on the contrary, trehalose levels in the less salt tolerant strains grown at  <dig>  m nacl were  <dig> fold-higher than those of the more salt-tolerant r. tropici ciat  <dig> grown under the same conditions . therefore, trehalose alone cannot account for the higher osmotolerance of r tropici ciat  <dig>  it is improbable that accumulation of mannitol by r tropici ciat  <dig> conferred it a higher halotolerance, as mannitol was also accumulated by the less salt-tolerant strains. other salt-induced responses, as modifications in the pattern of extracellular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides might be involved  <cit> . upon transposon mutagenesis, nogales et al  <cit>  identified eight gene loci required for adaptation of r tropici ciat  <dig> to high salinity. these included genes involved in regulation of gene expression, genes related to synthesis, assembly, and maturation of proteins, and genes related with cellular buildup and maintenance.

to date, three different enzymatic pathways have been described for trehalose synthesis in rhizobia . the most common two-step otsab pathway catalyzes the synthesis of trehalose from udp-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. trehalose synthase  catalyzes the reversible conversion of maltose and trehalose. finally, the two-step treyz pathway acts in the production of trehalose from a linear maltodextrin   <cit> . in this work, we showed the presence of otsa within the genome of the four rhizobium analyzed strains, suggesting that trehalose synthesis in these strains occurs at least via otsab. synthesis of trehalose from maltooligosaccharides in r. tropici ciat  <dig> was earlier reported  <cit> , although trey activity could not be detected  <cit> . interestingly, the phylogenetic position of otsa from r. gallicum bv phaseoli 8a <dig> and r. etli 12a <dig> was not consistent with the 16s rdna-based tree, suggesting the existence of lateral transfer events. avonce et al.  <cit>  also found inconsistencies in the topology of a proteobacterial otsa-based tree, and suggested to be caused by either lateral gene transfer or differential loss of paralogs.

cyclic -β-glucans have a role in hyposmotic adaptation of the legume symbiont rhizobiaceae  <cit> . in r. tropici ciat  <dig>  cells grown at low salinity, the cyclic β-glucan was co-extracted with the cytoplasmic compatible solute pool, suggesting that high amounts of beta glucan were present in the periplasm.. as trehalose, cyclic -β-glucans are synthesized from udp-glucose  <cit> . we found that mannitol and galactose were substrates for both trehalose and the β-glucan of r. tropici ciat  <dig>  in contrast, mannose was a substrate for the β-glucan but not for trehalose.. from the above data, we conclude that r. tropici ciat  <dig> can convert mannitol and galactose into udp-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate, the two trehalose precursors, but it cannot transform mannose into glucose-6-phosphate. in e. coli and other bacteria, galactose degradation pathway i  can yield both udp-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate  <cit> . thus, a similar route might be operating in r. tropici ciat  <dig>  by using mannitol as a carbon source, we showed that both trehalose moieties, as well as the β-glucan units, where derived directly from mannitol. in e. coli and other bacteria, mannitol and mannose enter the cell via specific phosphotransferase systems so the first intracellular species are mannitol-1-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate, respectively. in a second step, these phosphoderivatives are converted by a single dehydrogenase or isomerase reaction, respectively, into the glycolytic intermediate fructose-6-phosphate, which in turn is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the action of a phosphoglucose isomerase  <cit> . a search in the kegg specialized pathway database  <cit>  showed that the genomes of r. etli cfn  <dig>  r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig>  s. meliloti  <dig>  a. tumefaciens c <dig>  mesorhizobium loti maff <dig>  b. japonicum usda  <dig> and rhizobium sp. ngr  <dig>  among others, do not carry the mtla gene encoding the specific mannitol phosphotransferase, suggesting that in the rhizobiaceae mannitol do not use a phosphotransferase system to enter the cell. instead, we found the smoefgk genes encoding a sorbitol/mannitol abc transporter, mtlk , and xyla . by analogy with these phylogenetic relatives, we suggest that in r. tropici mannitol could be converted into glucose via fructose. in the case of mannose, we found that the above genomes carried manx, encoding the phosphohistidine-sugar phosphotransferase protein, suggesting that the first intracellular species is mannose-6-phosphate. the gene mana, encoding the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase  is present in s. meliloti, rhizobium sp. ngr  <dig>  a. tumefaciens and b. japonicum, but not in r. etli, r. leguminosarum, or m. loti. this finding suggests that the latter microorganisms, and most probably r. tropici ciat  <dig>  cannot convert mannose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate, and consequently it cannot yield glucose-6-phosphate. r. etli, r. leguminosarum and m. loti carried noek, encoding a phosphomannomutase that converts mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, and noej, encoding a mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase that converts mannose-1-phosphate to gdp-mannose, a precursor for glucan biosynthesis. in addition, r. tropici ciat <dig> carries a noej-like gene, as described by nogales et al  <cit> . again by analogy with its close relatives, we suggest that a similar pathway might be operating in r. tropici, explaining why this microorganism can synthesize the cyclic β-glucan from mannose, but cannot convert mannose into trehalose.

CONCLUSIONS
the accumulation of compatible solutes is referred as one of the main mechanisms of bacterial tolerance to osmotic stress conditions such as salinity and drought. in this work, we found that all rhizobium strains tested synthesized trehalose, whereas the most nacl-tolerant strain a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> synthesized mannosucrose. whereas this finding suggests that mannosucrose might be a better compatible solute than trehalose, this would need experimental support. despite trehalose synthesis was osmoregulated in r. tropici ciat  <dig>  our data suggest that trehalose alone cannot account for the higher osmotolerance of this strain. thus, osmoadaptation in r. tropici ciat  <dig>  is probably a complex process involving many physiological and biochemical response mechanisms, not yet fully elucidated. although trehalose, without doubt, participates in some way to alleviate osmotic stress, there is increasing evidence that trehalose is primarily a stress metabolite designed to ensure cell survival. in fact, trehalose synthesis in e. coli is under the control of the general stress factor σs, which is responsible for the expression of genes induced upon entry of stationary phase  <cit> . in s. meliloti, trehalose synthesis is under the control of the general stress factor rpoe <dig>  <cit> , which is also necessary for desiccation resistance  <cit> . thus, it may be possible that nacl-induced synthesis of trehalose and mannosucrose in the isolated soil strains are also involved in drought tolerance. this will be investigated in a future work.

in this work, we showed the presence of otsa within the genome of the four studied rhizobium strains, suggesting that trehalose synthesis in these strains occurs at least via otsab. in addition, by using mannitol as a carbon source, we showed that in r. tropici ciat  <dig> both trehalose moieties, as well as the β-glucan units, where derived directly from mannitol. this finding, together with in silico analysis of rhizobial genomes, suggests that r. tropici takes up mannitol via a sorbitol/mannitol abc transporter. subsequently, mannitol is converted to fructose  and the latter one into glucose, the trehalose precursor, by a xylose isomerase. in the case of mannose, the in silico analysis suggest that r. tropici incorporates it through a phosphotransferase system, yielding mannose-6-phosphate, but it cannot convert mannose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate, as it may lack the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase. this metabolic reconstruction would explain why r. tropici ciat  <dig> cannot synthesize trehalose from mannose.
