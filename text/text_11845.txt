BACKGROUND
the low success rate of in vitro embryo production procedures in cattle, together with early embryonic mortality, lead to the loss of a large number of potential calves, retarded genetic progress and consequently the loss of money and time for the cattle breeding industry. despite improvements on the culture media and culture conditions only 30–40% of the fertilised oocytes reach the blastocyst stage and it is generally accepted that the quality and developmental competence of in vitro produced  bovine embryos has failed to keep up with those of their in vivo counterparts  <cit> .

normal preimplantation embryo development in cattle is characterised by several cleavage divisions of the fertilised egg, activation of the embryonic genome around the 8– <dig> cell stage, compaction and blastocoel formation leading to the blastocyst. before the major activation of the embryonic genome, the bovine preimplantation embryo is controlled by maternal genomic information that is accumulated during oogenesis  <cit> . both the maternal and embryonic gene expression occurs in a stage- and time-dependent manner  <cit> .

the first important differentiation events take place at the blastocyst stage, resulting in the generation of two distinct cell lineages: the trophectoderm cells  and the inner cell mass . the icm gives rise to the embryo, whereas the te forms the placenta. since these two lineages are divergent in morphological and biochemical aspects, it is reasonable to hypothesise that many differentiation-related genes are expressed at this stage. genes being expressed in the blastocyst stage but not in earlier stages are therefore functional candidates for the regulative processes that take place at the onset of differentiation  <cit> . the identification of novel genes involved in blastocyst formation and the analysis of their expression patterns may help us to understand the mechanisms that control blastocyst formation and may help us to understand why certain embryos do not make it through this stage. as in vitro culture conditions do not fully mimic the in vivo situation and as it has been shown that morphological and physiological differences  <cit>  as well as differences in gene expression  <cit>  exist between in vivo and in vitro cultured embryos, the rna expression levels of in vitro produced embryos should be compared with those of in vivo "golden standard" embryos. changes in transcript abundance between in vitro and in vivo embryos may help to assess the normality of in vitro produced embryos and may help to optimise the in vitro culture conditions.

in previous studies, genes involved in preimplantation embryo development were identified using techniques such as differential display reverse transcription pcr  <cit> , large scale cdna library construction  <cit> , cdna microarray  <cit>  and suppression subtractive hybridisation   <cit> . subtractive cdna cloning  <cit>  is a powerful tool for the detection of stage-specific transcribed genes. in contrast to e.g. microarray analysis, this pcr-based method can be accomplished without prior knowledge of the genes being expressed, and yields subtracted cdna pools that are differentially expressed. however, further confirmation of the outcome is required by means of real-time pcr, which is a perfect technique not only to validate the subtractive cdna cloning results, but also to gather quantitative data concerning the selected transcripts. in the present study subtractive cdna cloning was used to detect genes that are differentially expressed in the bovine blastocyst compared to genes present in 2-cell and 8-cell stage embryos. the differential rna expression status of  <dig> subtracted cdna clones was validated throughout  <dig> stages of preimplantation embryo development  and compared with the rna expression levels of their in vivo "golden standard" counterparts using real-time pcr. by immunofluorescent labelling, the protein expression of  <dig> genes with high differences in rna expression levels between the developmental stages was examined during preimplantation embryo development to check whether the protein expression patterns were comparable with the rna expression levels.

RESULTS
construction and screening of the ssh library
a subtractive cdna library was constructed for the enrichment of transcripts preferentially expressed in in vitro cultured blastocysts relative to 2-cell and 8-cell embryos.

as bovine embryos contain limited amounts of mrna and as the subtractive cdna cloning requires at least  <dig>  μg of starting material, a linear amplification step was performed using the smart pcr cdna synthesis kit. by using  <dig> pcr cycles for linear amplification, the formation of non-specific pcr products due to overcycling was prevented.

the amplification products enriched for blastocyst specific genes were cloned, single clones were randomly picked and single-pass sequenced. partial sequence information was obtained for  <dig> clones. those partial sequences were compared with known sequences in the genbank by doing a blast analysis against the mammal nr database. blast searches revealed that  <dig> sequences were homologous to  <dig> different known genes,  <dig> sequences were homologous to genomic sequences and  <dig> clones had no matches in the database and could not be identified. the  <dig> remaining clones were false positives, giving similarity with the cloning vector. among the identified genes, we found  <dig> genes coding for ribosomal proteins and  <dig> mitochondrial genes.

the sequence data of the clones were submitted to the ncbi dbest database  <cit>  and the accession numbers and their putative identities are listed in table  <dig> 

quantification of specific transcripts by real-time pcr
real-time rt-pcr analysis was performed for  <dig> genes in order to make a relative quantification of the rna levels in the  <dig> studied bovine developmental stages and to check for differences in rna levels between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos.

primers were designed for a selection of  <dig> identified genes, based on their gene function. the primer information  is listed in table  <dig>  gene-specific amplification was confirmed for the  <dig> primer pairs by sequencing, by a single peak in melt-curve analysis and a single band with the expected size in agarose gel-electrophoresis. no primer-dimer formation was detected and the standard curves derived from 10-fold serial dilutions of pooled cdna gave correlation coefficients greater than  <dig>  and efficiencies between  <dig> and 105%. the rna expression levels of the selected genes were measured in duplicate in  <dig> to  <dig> single in vitro and in vivo produced embryos from the  <dig> studied stages of preimplantation development .

to correct for any variation in both mrna content and differences in enzymatic efficiencies, the quantitative results were normalised to the geometric mean of the  <dig> best reference genes as described in our previous study  <cit> . the normalised values for each target transcript were analysed using the 95% confidence intervals.

the mean relative abundances of the gene transcripts studied are shown in figure  <dig> 

krt <dig> was not detected up to the blastocyst stage, and no differences were observed between in vitro and in vivo produced embryos. for myl <dig> and fn <dig> the rna levels were significantly higher at the blastocyst stage compared to the earlier stages. remarkable is the  <dig> -fold higher fn <dig> rna expression in in vivo produced blastocysts compared with their in vitro produced counterparts.

the differences between the blastocysts and the 2/8-cell stage embryos for fth <dig> were smaller but significant in both in vitro and in vivo produced embryos.

atp1b <dig>  hint <dig>  slc25a <dig>  atp6v0b and rpl <dig> had significantly lower rna levels in in vitro produced 2/8-cell embryos compared to the in vitro produced blastocysts, but surprisingly no significant differences exist between the in vivo produced 8-cell and in vivo produced blastocyst embryos. this is due to a lower rna level in the in vivo produced blastocysts  on the one side and a higher rna level at the 8-cell stage  on the other side or a combination of both .

in contrast,  <dig> genes  showed a relative expression pattern that was not in agreement with the results obtained by ssh. the rna levels for those  <dig> genes were highest at the 8-cell stage and decreased significantly at the blastocyst stage. especially for cope but also for eef1a <dig> the in vivo produced 8-cell embryos had a significantly higher rna level than their in vitro produced counterparts.

immunofluorescent labelling
immunofluorescent labelling was performed for krt <dig>  fn <dig> and myl <dig> on in vitro produced embryos of different developmental stages  to verify whether the protein expression showed the same pattern as the rna expression. the results of the immunofluorescent labelling experiments are shown in figure  <dig> 

no krt <dig> expression was measured in the 2– <dig> cell and 5– <dig> cell embryos except for a few small positive spots on the surface of the embryos, which may be caused by remainders of cumulus cells. the first onset of the krt <dig> protein expression was detected at the morula day  <dig> p.i. and at the morula day  <dig> p.i. a ring of krt <dig> positive cells was observed. at the blastocyst stage, krt <dig> was predominantly expressed in the te cells, whereas little or no expression was measured in the icm. as shown in figure 3a, krt <dig> was detected at the cell-cell contact sites of the te cells.

fn <dig> was not detected in the first developmental stages. the first onset of fn <dig> expression was seen in 7-day old morulae and it was clearly present at the blastocyst stages. but in contrast to krt <dig>  fn <dig> was very distinct in the icm, forming filamentous structures between the te and the icm.

no myl <dig> protein expression was seen before  <dig> days p.i myl <dig> was strongly expressed at the late morula, the blastocyst and hatched blastocyst stage. in figure 3b one can appreciate that myl <dig> is located in the te cells surrounding the blastocoel cavity.

the images of the positive and negative control experiments are supplemented in additional file  <dig> 

the results of the immunofluorescent experiments were consistent with the rna expression patterns during preimplantation embryo development.

discussion
in the present study a subtractive cdna library was constructed between blastocyst embryos as the tester population and a pool of 2-cell and 8-cell embryos as the driver population, in order to enrich for genes differentially expressed at the blastocyst stage.

sequence information was obtained for  <dig> randomly picked clones. out of these  <dig> ests representing the blastocyst embryos,  <dig> were homologous to mitochondrial genes and  <dig> to ribosomal genes. mitochondria play an essential role in many events during early development. in cattle, the mtdna copy number increases during blastocyst expansion and hatching, consistent with an increase in mitochondrial rnas. this indicates that the transcriptional activation of the mitochondrial genome coincides with the pronounced structural and functional differentiation of the mitochondria during preimplantation development  <cit> . the largest group of ests was identified as genes involved in protein synthesis and included several ribosomal proteins. the high degree of ribosomal protein mrnas corresponds with previous data showing that between the 2-cell stage and the blastocyst stage, the level of ribosomal protein mrna is said to increase about 20-fold  <cit> . the protein content of in vivo derived preattachment cattle embryos increases 2-fold from the 2-cell through to the blastocyst stage  <cit> . this rise in protein content is correlated with rapid cell divisions at the late morula and early blastocyst stage  <cit> .

real-time qpcr was used to verify the ssh results and at the same time to compare the gene expression between in vitro produced embryos and in vivo golden standard embryos. the geometric mean of gapd, ywhaz and sdha was used for normalisation. vandesompele and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalisation leads to relative large errors and validated the geometric mean of multiple carefully selected housekeeping genes as an accurate normalisation factor. in goossens and colleagues  <cit>  it was demonstrated that gapd, ywhaz and sdha were stably expressed reference genes, suitable for normalisation of quantitative data within different preimplantation embryo stages. the problem of measuring rna expression levels throughout preimplantation development is confounded by the fact that cell numbers and cell sizes are constantly changing during this developmental interval. to allow ontogenic analysis, the embryos were compared as a single unit and the reference genes will correct for the differences between the embryos. other normalisation strategies, like normalisation against total cell number, normalisation against rna mass quantity or the use of exogenous control rna   <cit>  are not assumption free. spikes correct for differences in rna extraction and differences in enzymatic efficiencies but do not account for the quality and quantity of input sample.

in most studies about gene expression in embryos, only the rna expression was considered, but the differences in rna expression do not always imply differences on protein level, as there may be regulation at the translation level as well. by immunofluorescent labelling using mouse antibodies, the protein expression of krt <dig>  fn <dig> and myl <dig> was evaluated for the first time during bovine preimplantation embryo development. furthermore, the location of the protein expression in the embryo can tell us more about the specific function of the protein during the process of blastocyst formation.

both krt <dig> mrna and protein expression were found to be absent at the 2-cell and 8-cell stage and abundant at relatively high levels at the blastocyst stage, demonstrating the embryonic origin of this transcript. krt <dig> was only expressed in the cell-cell contact sites of the te, but not in those of the icm. this makes that krt <dig> can be seen as a marker for differentiation, adding to previous described markers for trophoblast differentiation in mice as there are cdx <dig> and eomes  <cit> . as te is a kind of specialized epithelium, genes involved in de novo differentiation of an epithelium, including gene families encoding for cell polarity, cell junctions, cytoskelet formation and ion transport  <cit>  are involved in te differentiation. krt <dig> is a cytoskeletal protein and is found, together with krt <dig>  in simple epithelia where they heterodimerise to form the intermediate filaments. they influence the 3-d formation of cell-cell or cell-substrate contacts in embryonic visceral endoderm  <cit> . stanton and green  <cit>  reported in mouse embryos a progressive rise for both krts from the 2-cell to the blastocyst stage, paralleling the development of the te. targeted deletion of krt <dig> in the mouse leads to trophoblast fragility and early embryonic lethality  <cit> . other cytoskeletal proteins such as α-catenin, β-catenin, occludin, zonula occludens protein- <dig> and connexin <dig> are also expressed at the cell-cell contact sides of the te cells  <cit> , suggesting a co-localisation with krt <dig> 

fn <dig> was found to be significantly higher expressed in blastocysts compared to the earlier stages, and this difference was even  <dig> × higher in the in vivo produced embryos compared to the in vitro produced ones. fn <dig> protein was predominantly expressed in the icm and formed filamentous structures between the te and the icm. the differential expression of fn <dig> in blastocyst stage embryos of several mammalian species, including bovine, has previously been reported by other authors  <cit>  and this gene has been associated with blastocyst formation. it is an adhesive extracellular matrix component and performs a vital role during cell proliferation, cell adhesion and cell mobility. it exists as a homodimer and is composed of several domains such as a heparin binding domain, a fibrin binding domain, a collagen binding domain and a cell recognition domain. this provides fn <dig> with the opportunity to interact with and bind to several ligands such as cells, heparin, fibrin, collagen, immunoglobulins and dna  <cit> . because events such as cell proliferation, cell adhesion and cell mobility are essential during early embryogenesis, fn <dig> does qualify as an important participant during this phase of embryo development. besides, aplin and colleagues  <cit>  reported that fn <dig> acts as a bridging ligand between the collagen matrix and integrins at the cytotrophoblast surface, mediating anchorage and/or migratory activity in the process of implantation. the vital importance of fn <dig> for normal embryo development has been demonstrated convincingly since mouse embryos lacking this protein die shortly after gastrulation from mesodermal defects  <cit> . the significant difference in fn <dig> mrna expression levels which we noticed between in vivo and in vitro produced bovine embryos has also been reported by mohan and colleagues  <cit> . lower rna levels exhibited by in vitro produced embryos may be responsible for the poor quality of these embryos compared to their in vivo counterparts.

myosin light chains associate with the motor protein myosin and are believed to play a role in the regulation of its actin-based atpase activity. rna levels of myl <dig>  the smooth muscle isoform of myosin light chain, were significantly higher at the blastocyst stage compared to the earlier stages. no significant differences were seen between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos. myl <dig> is involved in the cytoskeletal organisation  <cit>  which is in agreement with the observed protein expression in the te cells surrounding the blastocoel cavity. the expression of myl <dig> proteins around the blastocoel may also contribute to the statement of niimura  <cit>  who inferred that contractions in mouse blastocysts occur by activation of myosin light chain kinase resulting in the phosphorylation of myosin light chains and causing the efflux of blastocoelic fluid.

atp1b <dig> shows a significant difference in rna levels between the 2/8-cell stage and the blastocyst stage of in vitro produced embryos, but remarkably this difference is negligible for in vivo produced embryos. the na/k atpase consists of a catalytic α subunit and a noncatalytic, glycosylated β subunit, each encoded by multigene families  <cit> . the β subunit is required for structural and functional maturation of the α subunit  <cit> . blastocyst formation involves the establishment of a transtrophectoderm ion gradient mediated by the na/k atpase which pumps water through water channels called aquaporins  <cit> . accumulation of fluid in the blastocoel is essential for differentiation of the icm and te cell types  <cit> . the gene expression patterns of several na/k atpase subunits have been reported previously in mouse  <cit>  and bovine  <cit> , and adjaye and colleagues  <cit>  identified atp1b <dig> as a marker specific for the te in human blastocysts using a cdna microarray but as far as we know, this is the first study in which the rna expression levels of atp1b <dig> in bovine embryos are described. the higher atp1b <dig> rna levels in in vitro produced blastocysts might be an explanation for the faster blastulation of in vitro produced embryos compared to in vivo produced ones. van soom and colleagues  <cit>  have demonstrated that in vivo morulae display a more firm and prolonged compaction and that they start blastulation at a later embryonic age and cell number, moreover the addition of serum to the culture medium seemed to enhance blastocyst development  <cit> . in vivo morulae develop more gradually to the blastocyst stage and this might go together with a slower rise in atp1b <dig> expression. another explanation for the higher atp1b <dig> expression in vitro might be a compensation for the lower expression of another na/k atpase subunit or another functional analogue, but this was not further investigated.

the differences between the blastocysts and the 2- and 8-cell stage embryos for fth <dig> were smaller but significant and no differences were observed between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos. fth <dig> has an important role in the control of intracellular iron distribution and the constitution of long term iron stores. the ferroxidase activity associated with the h subunit is necessary for iron uptake by the ferritin molecule. fth1-/- mice embryos die between  <dig>  and  <dig>  days of development  <cit>  demonstrating that the ferritin h subunit is indispensable for embryonic development. fth <dig> was also present in the human blastocyst ssh library as reported by morozov et al.  <cit> .

the mrna levels for atp6v0b, hint <dig>  rpl <dig> and slc25a <dig> were higher at the blastocyst stage compared to the earlier stages for in vitro produced embryos, but no significant differences existed between the in vivo produced 8-cell and in vivo produced blastocyst embryos. the qpcr results of those genes for in vitro produced embryos confirmed the results of the subtractive cdna library.

the rna expression patterns of the remaining genes  were not in agreement with the subtractive cdna cloning results. those genes were abundant at an equal amount or higher at the earlier stages. those false positives prove the requirement for the verification of the subtractive cdna outcome and are in agreement with the reported 30% false positives obtained by subtractive cdna cloning in previous studies  <cit> . the significantly higher rna levels in vivo produced 8-cell embryos for cope but also for eef1a <dig> is an important observation. cope is a subunit of the coatomer protein complex and is involved in the retrograde golgi-to-er transport of dilysine-tagged proteins, whereas eef1a <dig> is responsible for the enzymatic delivery of aminoacyl trnas to the ribosome. both genes are involved in protein synthesis. around the 8– <dig> cell stage the embryonic genome becomes active, resulting in the synthesis of embryonic proteins. the lower expression of genes involved in protein synthesis  in in vitro 8-cell embryos might indicate that the embryonic protein synthesis is affected or delayed in in vitro embryos.

differences in gene expression between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos reflect the effects of the in vitro culture system on the transcriptional activity  <cit> . preimplantation embryos are capable of developing in a wide range of culture conditions. however, this adaptation of the embryo to suboptimal conditions may result in a lower embryo quality. it will be a challenge for the future to determine the importance of the affected genes for the process of embryo development and to change the culture conditions in vitro in order to induce the expression of those genes to levels identical to those under in vivo conditions, and in this way improve the quality of the embryo.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study add to the knowledge of the process of bovine blastocyst formation. several genes were identified as candidate markers involved in blastocyst formation. the fact that some of those candidate genes were differentially expressed between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos confirms the belief that culture conditions influence embryonic gene expression. further functional analyses of these candidate genes may help to optimise in vitro embryo culture systems in order to improve the quality of in vitro produced bovine embryo.
