BACKGROUND
rett syndrome  is a neurodevelopmental disorder and a leading cause of severe intellectual disability in females  <cit> . distinguishing features of rtt include a loss of previously acquired skills such as communication, purposeful hand movements and mobility, as well as deceleration of head growth, seizures, and the development of characteristic stereotypic hand wringing.

one of the most prominent neuropathological features of rtt is the impairment of normal neuronal development, primarily at the synapse with a disruption to the normal development of axodendritic connections. there is a decrease in the size of the rtt brain which is partially explained by a decrease in the size of individual neuronal cell bodies, an increase in the packing density of neurons  <cit> , possibly an absence of specific neuronal populations  <cit>  and a decrease in dendritic arborization  <cit> . additionally, areas of 'naked' dendritic spines are observed on pyramidal neurons of layer ii and iii in the frontal cortex  <cit> .

the rtt neuropathology manifests in specific regions of the brain. the shortening and thickening of dendritic branches are observed in the same brain regions that have a decreased volume, for example layers iii and v of the frontal, motor and inferior temporal regions, whereas the dendrites of the occipital cortex are comparatively less affected  <cit> .

a diagnosis of rtt is typically made on the evolving clinical phenotype, although most cases have a genetic basis and are caused by mutations in the x-linked mecp <dig> gene   <cit> . mecp <dig> has been thought to be a transcriptional repressor that acts by binding to methylated cg dinucleotides in some gene promoters, ultimately causing chromatin compaction leading to gene silencing. more recent studies suggest that it may also mediate splicing  <cit> , may be involved in the higher order organization of chromatin architecture  <cit> , and in some circumstances can act as a transcriptional activator  <cit> .

a small subset of atypical cases with a rtt-like phenotype, characterized by the early onset of seizures, is associated with mutations in cdkl <dig>   <cit> , whilst some individuals with the congenital rtt variant have mutations in the foxg <dig>  gene  <cit> , and still others remain genetically undefined.

the localization of mecp <dig> to the postsynaptic region  <cit>  as well as the nucleus, coupled with the possibility that more than one gene locus is affected, suggests that dysfunction of more than one molecular pathway may contribute to the neurological phenotype, and these pathways could involve abnormal transcription and/or synaptic transmission.

in order to gain an insight into the molecular pathways that may be affected in rtt, it is important to determine the genes whose transcription patterns are altered. recent studies have uncovered a number of these genes in frontal cortices of human  <cit> , human non-clonal  <cit>  and clonal  <cit>  lymphoblast cell lines, human clonal fibroblasts  <cit> , and various mecp <dig> mouse models  <cit> . some genes have been found to be under the direct transcriptional control of mecp <dig> and so the downstream effect of this misregulation offers clues as to the molecular basis of the severe neurological deficit that is observed in rtt.

in this study we capitalized on the observation that rtt pathology is predominates in specific neuroanatomical regions of the brain. cdna microarray analysis uncovered a number of genes that were abnormally expressed in the frontal cortex, but not in the occipital cortex of rtt patients. using rna interference, the differential expression of these genes was confirmed in vitro to result from a deficiency in mecp <dig>  the direct interaction between mecp <dig> and the promoter of some of these genes was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation . in addition, the functional consequence of the differential expression of one of the genes, cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig>  was evaluated.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes in the frontal cortex of rett syndrome brains
control brain samples were  not age-matched . at the time the study was performed, we were unable to access age-matched controls from australia or the usa. we acknowledge that expression patterns may change with age, however, the genes that were analyzed following initial microarray analysis were also  differentially expressed in an in vitro rnai-mediated knockdown system and  differentially expressed between the frontal and occipital cortex of the individual rtt brain samples, independent of any comparison with the control brain samples. it should be noted that after careful consideration it was decided that this was a unique opportunity to be able to utilize these postmortem samples that we had available to us, however it was obvious to us from the outset that using postmortem brain samples of different ages, was a shortcoming of the study.

the frontal cortex is one of the brain regions in rtt that displays the characteristic histopathology associated with this disorder. in order to establish if there is abnormal expression of a subset of genes in the rtt frontal cortex, we examined and compared mrna expression profiles between the rtt and control frontal and occipital cortices. four sets of six microarray experiments were conducted . the double arrows represent co-hybridization of the samples at each end of the arrows. for example, six individual rtt frontal cortices were co-hybridized with six individual control frontal cortices.

based on this experimental design differential expression between:  the rtt frontal cortex and control frontal cortex would possibly be due to individual variation or could be contributing to rtt pathology;  the rtt frontal cortex and rtt occipital cortex would possibly be due to normal expression differences that occur between these brain regions or could be contributing to rtt pathology, and  the control frontal cortex and control occipital cortex would possibly be due to normal expression differences that occur between these brain regions. using a subtractive method, genes that were exclusively differentially expressed in the rtt frontal cortex were determined as those that were differentially expressed in  and , but not in . genes that were differentially expressed between the rtt occipital cortex and control occipital cortex were considered to be due mostly to individual variation as this region appears to be spared the reduction in dendritic trees  <cit>  and volume that is observed in other regions of the rtt brain.

samples were evaluated on an individual basis, rna samples were not pooled.

the number of transcripts that reached 'cut-off' for each set of analyses were those that were expressed above minimal pixel intensity, and were therefore considered to be expressed in the brain samples analyzed . those that were considered differentially expressed either by 'fold-change' analysis or by sam analysis were determined and the genes of interest in the group that overlapped these two types of analysis are listed in table  <dig>  the expression of these genes was verified using quantitative reverse transcription -pcr.

the number of genes that passed cut-off were those that were expressed  and undistorted  in each group of  <dig> experiments. the number of genes that was deemed significantly differentially expressed is listed for the 'fold change'  and the sam analysis comparison. fc = frontal cortex; oc = occipital cortex. a gene that was differentially expressed between rtt fc vs. con fc and rtt fc vs. rtt oc, and not in the con fc vs. con oc was considered for further analysis. column labeled 'overlap' contains the number of transcripts that were differentially expressed in both the fold-change and the sam analysis.

these genes were differentially expressed in the rtt frontal cortex when compared to expression in the rtt occipital cortex and the control frontal cortex. n.b. the value given for differential expression  refers to the average of the experiments; sd = standard deviation; sem = standard error of the mean; m = mitochondrial.

* this sequence is 99% identical to 16s ribosomal mitochondrial rna, and also to some nuclear encoded cdnas.

qrt-pcr was performed using new rna extractions taken from the same tissue as that subjected to microarray analysis. clu, co <dig>  crmp <dig> and dnm <dig> were each differentially expressed in the rtt frontal cortex when compared to the rtt occipital cortex  and when compared to the control frontal cortex . each was differentially expressed in the same direction as in the microarray analysis. interestingly, dnm <dig> was upregulated in the rtt frontal cortex compared to the rtt occipital cortex , and compared to the control frontal cortex  however, the expression in the rtt occipital cortex was also significantly lower than the control occipital cortex , suggesting that it was downregulated in the rtt occipital cortex. aplp <dig> was significantly upregulated in the rtt frontal cortex compared to the control frontal cortex . both gnb <dig> and gdi <dig> were significantly differentially expressed in the rtt frontal cortex compared to the rtt occipital cortex . gdi <dig> appeared to be expressed less in the rtt frontal cortex compared to the control frontal cortex however this was not statistically significant. eml <dig>  hmn <dig> and rtn <dig> were not significantly differentially expressed by qrt-pcr, even though eml <dig> and rtn <dig> showed an expression trend similar to that observed in the microarray experiments.

these data indicate that a subset of genes is  differentially expressed in the frontal cortex of rtt patients. in summary, clu, co <dig>  crmp <dig> and dnm <dig> were specifically differentially expressed in the rtt frontal cortex compared to rtt occipital cortex and control frontal cortex, aplp <dig> was specifically differentially expressed in the rtt frontal cortex compared to the control frontal cortex and gdi <dig> and gnb <dig> were differentially expressed in the rtt frontal cortex when compared to the rtt occipital cortex. eml <dig>  hmn <dig> and rtn <dig> were not differentially expressed.

dnmi, gnbi, co <dig> and clu are differentially expressed following in vitro rnai-mediated mecp <dig> knockdown
to provide more specific evidence that reduced expression or function of mecp <dig> is responsible for the altered mrna expression noted in the microarray experiments, rnai was used to knockdown mecp <dig> in vitro. a  <dig> base pair dsrna construct that targeted exon  <dig> of mecp <dig> was transfected into cultured sh-sy5y cells. knockdown efficiency was evaluated by assessing mecp <dig> mrna  and protein  expression. time course experiments were conducted to evaluate the level and duration of the knockdown . mrna expression was consistently reduced by 75% to 80% with the greatest reduction observed at day  <dig> -  <dig>  protein expression was consistently lowest at day  <dig> -  <dig> with greater than 90% knockdown, and with complete recovery to normal levels between day  <dig> and day  <dig> 

co <dig>  clu, dnmi and gnbi were amongst the transcripts of interest that had statistically significant differential expression in the rtt frontal cortex. clu and co <dig> were of interest because of known associations with neurological disorders, and co <dig> because of the described mitochondrial abnormalities observed in rtt. dnmi and gnbi were of interest because of their respective roles in endocytosis and signal transduction in neurons.

the differential expression of these genes in rtt could be the result of a direct interaction of mecp <dig> with these genes or it could be due to the interaction of mecp <dig> with a gene upstream in a common pathway. we investigated the expression of these genes following rnai-mediated knockdown of mecp <dig> in sh-sy5y cells. the expression pattern of these genes was analyzed over a fourteen day period, either with or without retinoic acid-induced differentiation of sh-sy5y cells . time course experiments were conducted twice and qrt-pcr measurement of the expression of each gene was conducted in triplicate on two occasions for each time course experiment. the expression levels of each gene were normalized to the expression levels of gapdh, and therefore values on the y axis reflect a ratio of expression of the gene of interest to the expression of gapdh in the same sample. the expression of gapdh is unaffected by mecp <dig> knockdown .

clu mrna expression in undifferentiated cells gradually fell throughout the  <dig> days . the reduction was less pronounced in the mecp <dig> knockdown sample however , than in the control . in the differentiated samples clu expression increased in the mecp <dig> knockdown sample , whilst it fell in the control sample . therefore, the absence of mecp <dig> in differentiated cells caused an uncharacteristic increase in clu expression. it is not entirely clear why clu showed a general trend downward in undifferentiated cells. expression in sh-sy5y cells was evaluated a number of times and for up to  <dig> days . it repeatedly showed a downward trend which would plateau after  <dig> div. as clusterin is a secreted protein that binds membranes and possibly inhibits apoptosis by interfering with bax activation in mitochondria  <cit> , it is possible that the initial higher levels of expression were a consequence of the in vitro culturing of the cells and the initial stress on the cells following passaging, whilst they adhere to the culture dish and become confluent.

undifferentiated cells showed a gradual increase in co <dig> mrna expression in control samples . following mecp <dig> knockdown however, there was a  <dig> -fold reduction of co <dig> expression at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  differentiation of sh-sy5y cells caused a dramatic rise in co <dig> expression in the control sample , however this was not reflected in mecp <dig> knockdown sample, where by day  <dig> co <dig> expression increased only  <dig> -fold. thus, it appeared that a normal increase in co <dig> expression during cellular differentiation was suppressed by mecp <dig> knockdown.

dnmi mrna expression remained steady in both the differentiated and undifferentiated control samples . however, following mecp <dig> knockdown, there was a 2-fold increase in the undifferentiated sample  and 3-fold in the differentiated sample. in both cases expression levels returned to basal levels by day  <dig> 

gnbi mrna expression remained steady in the undifferentiated control sample and then increased 46-fold following differentiation . following mecp <dig> knockdown, gnbi expression increased  <dig> -fold in undifferentiated samples and 77-fold in differentiated samples. therefore, a significant increase in gnbi expression was observed in the absence of mecp <dig> 

each of these genes showed differential expression following in vitro mecp <dig> knockdown in the same direction  observed in the patient brain samples. this differential expression was more pronounced following the differentiation of the sh-sy5y cells into a neuron-like phenotype. these results suggest that the abnormal expression of clu, co <dig>  dnmi and gnbi is due to a lack of mecp <dig> 

mecp <dig> associates with promoter regions of clu, crmp <dig>  dnmi and gnbi
the upregulation of clu, dnmi, gnbi and in some analyses, crmp <dig>  was further investigated by evaluating a potential association between mecp <dig> and sequences within the promoters of these genes. co <dig> was not investigated in this experiment due to the fact that mitochondrially-encoded genes lack cpg methylation, and it is therefore not likely to be under the direct transcriptional control of mecp <dig>  for differentiated and undifferentiated sh-sy5y, proteins were cross-linked to genomic dna, followed by shearing of the chromatin, and immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for mecp <dig> and baf  <dig>  after reversing the protein/dna cross-links, the immunoprecipitated dna was purified and subjected to quantitative real time pcr. clusterin and crmp <dig> interestingly showed minimal association with mecp <dig> in undifferentiated cells. however, following ra-induced differentiation of the cells to a mature neuron-like phenotype, mecp <dig> showed greater association with these genes . in contrast there was a strong association between dnmi and gnbi promoter regions with mecp <dig>  in differentiated and undifferentiated cells. the chip assay clearly shows that mecp <dig> is associated with bdnf promoter in human sh-sy5y cells .

cytochrome c oxidase activity is reduced following mecp <dig> knockdown
down-regulation of co <dig> expression in both the rtt frontal cortex postmortem tissue and in vitro following mecp <dig> knockdown suggests mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to rtt neuropathology. this gene is of specific interest because of reports of mitochondrial abnormalities in rtt  <cit> . to determine if down-regulation of the mitochondrially-encoded, largest subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, co <dig>  was associated with a functional abnormality of cytochrome c oxidase , cox enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the rate of oxidation of reduced cytochrome c following in vitro mecp <dig> knockdown in sh-sy5y cell line three days post-transfection with the mecp <dig> dsrna knockdown oligonucleotide, or the control.

the reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity at day  <dig> in the mecp2-deficient system  was statistically significant, being approximately 60% of that observed in the untreated sample at day  <dig> and the control sample at day  <dig>  this therefore suggests that the down-regulation of co <dig> in the frontal cortex of rtt brains may be functionally significant, as cox activity is reduced, which potentially could impact on the efficiency of atp generation in the brain.

discussion
the discovery that mutations in mecp <dig> are responsible for most cases of rtt has led researchers to search for transcriptional targets and misregulated expression of genes. a profile of aberrantly expressed genes or classes of genes has slowly emerged, and subsequent downstream functional analyses of these genes are shedding light on the impact that their abnormal expression has on the pathology of rtt. various mrna microarray or differential display studies in human postmortem tissue  <cit> , mecp2-mutant mice  <cit> , patient fibroblast  <cit> , lymphoblastoid  <cit>  and lymphocyte cells  <cit> , and neuroblastoma  cells in which mecp <dig> has been knocked down  <cit> , have revealed that mecp <dig> transcriptionally controls a wide range of functionally distinct genes.

our aim was to expand the repertoire of genes that are aberrantly expressed in the rtt brain. to achieve this, we took the novel approach of evaluating differential mrna expression between an affected and an unaffected brain region in mecp <dig> mutation-positive rtt patient postmortem tissue samples while also comparing mrna expression in diseased and healthy tissue. we acknowledge that a potential limitation of our study is that at the time of this study we were unable to obtain equivalent age-matched control samples. it could be argued that the observed differences are a consequence of the developmental and aging processes or could be an epiphenomenon as a result of the disease process. however, we feel that the conclusions drawn in this exploratory phase of the study were valid for several reasons. firstly, we applied very stringent criteria in selecting genes for further study, including the requirement that for a gene to be flagged as potentially significant it had to be differentially expressed in at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> relevant microarray data sets. secondly, comparison of microarray data sets of different regions in the same subject yielded results that were consistent with our central hypothesis, namely that brain region-specific differences in gene expression would allow us to identify genes of potential biological relevance to the rtt neurodevelopmental phenotype. thirdly, the subset of genes we chose for further analysis all showed differential expression in our rnai-mediated knockdown system in the same direction as was seen in the microarray experiments. finally, enzymatic studies of cytochrome c oxidase in the rnai treated sh-sy5y cells confirmed that the abnormalities seen at the rna level were of functional significance at the protein level.

only one other microarray study has used rtt patient brain samples as the source material  <cit> . there were, however, a number of limitations of this study, including difficulties in comparing expression data obtained by using different microarray procedures, which differed significantly in four ways - substrates , types of labels , numbers of cdna clones , and the threshold for delineating differential expression. for our studies we used only one array platform, containing around  <dig>  transcripts, and employed very stringent filtering criteria with the aim of having a low false discovery rate of less than  <dig> %. using this approach we identified only a small number of genes showing altered expression in the frontal cortex of rtt patients, and our in vitro studies of a subset of these genes recapitulated our microarray results.

recognized, but little studied, findings in rtt patients are morphological abnormalities of mitochondria  <cit> , functional defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain  <cit> , and evidence of increased oxidative stress  <cit> . in addition, some of the non-neurological manifestations of rtt have been seen in patients with primary respiratory chain disorders, including short stature, myopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction  <cit> . however, the contribution of these functional abnormalities of the respiratory chain to the pathogenesis of rtt remains unclear. at a molecular level, an association between mecp <dig> and the promoter of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein  <dig> has been demonstrated  with subsequent up-regulation of this gene and mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in mecp2-null mice  <cit> , as noted above. here we show that cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> expression was down-regulated exclusively in the frontal cortex of the rtt brain. this down-regulation was a consequence of mecp <dig> deficiency  and manifested as a decrease in cox enzyme activity. these two findings suggest that a defect in mecp <dig> activity is likely to result in significant dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the brain and possibly other organs, which could contribute to the clinical abnormalities seen in rtt patients. it should be noted however that cpg methylation is absent in mitochondrially-encoded genes. therefore, it is not likely that cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> is under the direct transcriptional control of mecp <dig>  but may be affected as a consequence of a direct interaction of mecp <dig> and a nuclear-encoded component of the processes responsible for mitochondrial dna replication, transcription or translation, or direct interaction of mecp <dig> with a nuclear-encoded protein that plays a role in maintaining the structure and stability of the cox protein complex.

dynamin i was upregulated in the frontal cortex of the rtt brain, and we have demonstrated in vitro that it was upregulated as a result of mecp <dig> knockdown, and that the promoter region of dynamin i associated with mecp <dig>  dynamin i is a large gtpase that is involved synaptic vesicle endocytosis. specifically, it assembles around the invaginated clathrin-coated pit and pinches the vesicle from the plasma membrane  <cit> . other indications of abnormalities in synaptic transmission in rtt have come from studies investigating the aberrant expression of glutamate receptors such as nmda and ampa receptors at excitatory synapses  <cit> , and associated impairment of both long term potentiation  and depression   <cit> , and by the correction of abnormalities in ltp when mecp <dig> deficiency is reversed in a mouse model of rtt  <cit> . nmda receptor expression is decreased in rtt and interestingly, the internalization of this receptor is clathrin-mediated and is facilitated by a postsynaptic member of the dynamin family, dynamin  <dig>  <cit> . additionally, it has been demonstrated that synaptic activity can induce phosphorylation of mecp <dig> which subsequently leads to gene transcription  <cit> . the increase in the expression of dynamin i in the frontal cortex of rtt patients may manifest as abnormal rates of synaptic vesicle cycling which adds another dimension to the idea that anomalous synaptic transmission is contributing to the severe cognitive impairment in rtt.

the regulation of expression and function of the glycoprotein clusterin remains incompletely defined. it is associated with apoptosis, and whilst it is thought to promote tumor progression in cancer through bax interaction  <cit> , it possibly suppresses beta-amyloid deposition in alzheimer disease  <cit> . upregulation of clusterin expression is not only associated with amyloid deposits in alzheimer disease  <cit>  but also with various other neurological disorders. increased expression is associated with deposition of prion protein in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  <cit> , with status epilepticus  <cit>  and following cerebral ischemia where it is associated with tissue remodeling  <cit> . in the brain it is expressed in specific neuronal populations of cells in the hippocampus and cerebellum. these are regions of the brain that have been implicated in dysfunction in rtt at a histological level, and increasing evidence now also suggests that these regions are also dysfunctional at a molecular level. in this study, clusterin was upregulated in the frontal cortex of rtt brains and this upregulation was the result of mecp <dig> deficiency as demonstrated by in vitro rnai-mediated knockdown of mecp <dig>  in addition, the cpg-rich promoter region of clusterin associates with mecp <dig>  and it is interesting to note that it has previously been shown that expression of clusterin is induced by histone deacetylase inhibitors  <cit> , raising the possibility that one mechanism by which mecp <dig> mutations may exert their effect could be by failing to repress transcription through the interaction of mecp <dig> with histone deacetylase. interestingly, in the delgado study, clusterin was underexpressed in mutant t-lymphocyte clones from rtt patients  <cit> . whether abnormal expression of clusterin is related to a pro- or anti-apoptotic function is unknown, but the fact that it is upregulated in a region that displays a greater level of cellular pathology makes it seem likely that its role in rtt is not of a neuroprotective nature.

crmp <dig> is involved in semaphorin-induced growth cone collapse during neural development. it was upregulated in the rtt frontal cortex and we showed that mecp <dig> associated with its promoter region in differentiated neuronal cell cultures. in adult mice, crmp <dig> is localized to dendrites of cortical and hippocampal  pyramidal neurons  <cit> , where it is possibly involved in neurite outgrowth and ltp  <cit> . crmp <dig> knockout mice display abnormal map <dig> staining  <cit> . abnormalities in crmp <dig> expression in this study may explain in part the morphological abnormalities observed in neurons in the rtt brain whereby there is a decrease in dendritic arborization.

this study utilized stringent inclusion criteria for differentially expressed genes. it can be noted however  that there was a large number of transcripts that were differentially expressed in some comparisons, but not in others. it is interesting to note that a number of the genes that were up- or downregulated in the frontal cortex were also up- or downregulated in other studies. another component of the respiratory chain succinate dehydrogenase , eh-domain containing  <dig>  and amyloid precursor protein were all differentially expressed in some of the analyses in this study as well as in the study conducted by colantuoni et al.  <cit> . genes that were statistically upregulated in this study  were also upregulated in the delgardo study including eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit  <dig> alpha, thioredoxin, autism susceptibility candidate  <dig> and cox  <dig> homolog. mir  is a protein linking membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, pam  catalyzes neuroendocrine peptides and fhl <dig>  involved in cell growth and differentiation. these transcripts were all differentially expressed in the frontal cortex in this study  and in rtt-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines  <cit> . additionally, creatine kinase was upregulated by sam analysis in the frontal cortex in this study and in the olfactory proteomic study  <cit> .

this study has looked at the differential expression of genes in an area of the rtt brain that displays abnormal neuronal development. we have found that this differential expression was reproduced in an in vitro mecp <dig> rnai system. the promoter regions of two of these genes  associated with mecp <dig> in differentiated and undifferentiated neuron-like cells, whilst two other genes  associated with mecp <dig> in differentiated cells only. in addition, downregulation of co <dig> expression manifested as a downregulation of cox activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

in summary, this study has further contributed to our understanding of how mecp2-mediated misregulation of transcriptional repression of subsets of genes may influence the pathology in rtt. of particular importance is the emerging role of mitochondrial dysfunction as well as the possibility that specific abnormalities in synaptic transmission contribute to the disease.

in considering the role of mecp2-regulated genes highlighted in this study, further investigations of the effect of mecp <dig> on apoptosis and/or neuroprotection, respiratory chain function, vesicle-mediated endocytosis, and secondary messenger/cell signaling in the rtt brain may provide further insight in to the pathophysiology of rtt.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have used microarray technology to identify targets of mecp <dig>  the gene responsible for most cases of the devastating neurodevelopmental disorder rett syndrome. this is only the second time that brain samples from humans with rett syndrome have been used in such a study. using a stringent filtering approach we have found only a small number of genes show consistent altered expression in the frontal cortex of rett syndrome patients. we provide evidence that rett syndrome may in part be due to abnormalities of mitochondrial respiratory chain function and neuronal vesicle dynamics.
