BACKGROUND
there is a growing demand by the pharmaceutical and medical industries for protein molecules, including antibodies, of diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy, as well as a perpetual need in the production and manufacturing industries for improved biocatalysts. these demands have directed the innovation of a number of sophisticated and complex methods for the in vitro evolution and optimization of proteins  <cit> . one fundamental approach to this process is the introduction of random mutations into a known nucleotide sequence to produce a library of variants. these variants are subsequently translated to produce modified proteins that are accordingly screened for chosen properties.

the potential of this approach has been limited by deficiencies in the methods currently available for random mutagenesis and library generation  <cit> . current methods exclusively target dna, and include error-prone pcr   <cit> , the incorporation of triphosphate derivatives of nucleoside analogues with taq or other dna polymerases  <cit>  and novel error-prone dna polymerases or polymerase blends  <cit> . unfortunately, dna-based mutagenesis systems generally suffer from a nucleotide incorporation bias that favors transitions over transversions and/or results in a skewed preference for mutations at either a/t or g/c pairs  <cit> . without doubt, base substitution bias will diverge the distribution of mutations from a poisson distribution, effectively diminishing the functional size of a randomly mutated gene library available for subsequent screening  <cit> . in essence, any nucleotide bias reduces the probability for generating specific amino acid substitutions that may be required at key positions along the protein, dramatically reducing the potential for recovering protein variants with a desired set of properties. directed protein evolution using powerful selection strategies such as ribosome display  are more likely to identify improved variants when a library is maximally diverse which would be the case when all variants in a library are equally probable  <cit> .

we have exploited qβ bacteriophage rna replicase, an error-prone rna-dependent rna polymerase, and its ability to amplify and mutate rna very rapidly, to develop an in vitro mutagenesis strategy targeting mrna. we have found that base substitutions at the rna level are made with very little bias for the incorporation of particular bases, approaching what can be considered as ideal random mutagenesis. the result is the generation of random mrna libraries carrying very high diversity.

to verify that qβ replicase manufactured variant mrna libraries can be highly effective tools for in vitro protein evolution, two basic demonstrations are presented here. first, qβ replicase mutagenesis in combination with a simple functional assay was used to alter the substrate specificity of β-lactamase for the antibiotic cefotaxime. and second, qβ mrna mutagenesis coupled to ribosome display was used to enhance the affinity of a single domain antibody fragment  to its antigen. ribosome display is an in vitro display and selection strategy that couples the newly translated protein to the ribosome complex, which in turn, remains tethered to the mrna message due to the absence of a stop codon on the mrna . an mrna library can be translated in vitro and the ribosome-protein-mrna complexes can be subsequently screened  for binding towards the appropriate molecule and non-specific or weaker binding complexes removed by extensive washing.  <cit> . the mrna is eluted from the remaining  ribosome complexes and amplified with rt-pcr. ribosome display, in particular, is ideal for the effective screening of large mrna libraries, with the number of variants that can be screened limited only by the total number of ribosomes in solution  and the total amount of mrna that can be added to the translation mix  <cit> .

RESULTS
constructing the qβ replicase mutagenesis and ribosome display vectors
developing a vector that would allow for the routine application of qβ replicase for the amplification of target mrna that could also subsequently be used directly in ribosome display was not straightforward. as qβ phage has a double-stranded rna genome, qβ replicase has a strong bias for replicating its own genome with both rna  and  strands serving as templates  <cit> . to adapt this stringent template preference and allow replication of foreign rnas, pegx <dig>  a universal mutagenesis vector  was constructed based around a small multi-cloning site  inserted into a modified rq 135- <dig> sequence. the rq 135- <dig> sequence is the result of a spontaneous recombination of e. coli  <dig> s rna and the phage λ origin of replication with the resulting sequence efficiently recognized and amplified by qβ-replicase  <cit> . the integrated mcs did not appear to perturb the secondary structure required by qβ-replicase to recognize the rna template. an upstream t <dig> rna polymerase promoter sequence on pegx <dig> was used to synthesize rna suitable for qβ-replicase.

for the coupling of mutagenesis to ribosome display, pegx <dig> was modified to generate a dual purpose mutagenesis/ribosome display vector  by adding various elements required for efficient translation and for tethering the mrna to the ribosome complex . the mrna transcribed from this vector was subsequently mutated with qβ replicase, heat denatured and shunted directly into ribosome display. note that the 5'-utr, the kozak sequence, the target gene, and the cl region were cloned in the reverse orientation relative to the t <dig> promoter to avoid intrinsic stop codons found in our modified rq 135- <dig> sequence. a prerequisite for ribosome display is that there are no stop codons downstream of the translational start signal. consequently, the target gene sequence, the cl tether, and the downstream segment of our modified rq sequence  could not include a translational stop codon. however, stop codons are found in all three frames of the 3' segment of the rq 135- <dig> sequence but in only two frames of the 5' segment. by cloning into the appropriate frame in the reverse orientation relative to the rq sequence, stop codons were avoided down stream of the translational start codon. qβ replicase amplifies rna in both directions, using both the  and  rna strands as templates, consequently, mrna in the correct orientation for translation and ribosome display was innately generated following qβ replicase mutagenesis . note that due to the replication of both  and  rna strands, replication of the starting template would be expected to be limited to one round of replication that would stall when inert rna duplexes are eventually formed by annealed  and  strands. however, the rq 135- <dig> sequence contains highly developed secondary structures that have been postulated to prevent complementary  and  strands of rna from annealing to each other during replication leading to efficient and very rapid replication  <cit> . this property also appears to be important with respect to translation. ugarov and collegues  <cit>  found that the expression of mrnas in cell-free translation systems was greatly enhanced as a result of their insertion into rq <dig> rna, again partly attributed to the very stable tertiary structure of the rq <dig> rna. we have found that qβ replicase amplified mrna, upon heat denaturing , was a suitable template for translation without the need to further purify and isolate the correct strand for translation.

the mutational spectrum of qβ replicase
a  <dig> base pair random gene sequence  from escherichia coli was used as a model template to establish the mutational spectrum of qβ replicase and to compare this with the mutational profiles generated by other mutagenesis methods. the  <dig> bp rds had a gc content of 53% and did not contain any unusually long stretches of any particular nucleotide. the rgs was embedded into the rq 135- <dig> sequence via the mcs of pegx <dig>  the mrna synthesized from this template was subsequently amplified and mutated with qβ replicase . the mutated mrna was converted to cdna using rt-pcr and cloned. random clones were selected and sequenced. under the conditions outlined here, the qβ replicase error rate was approximately  <dig> substitution in every  <dig> bases. the data in figure  <dig> demonstrates that qβ replicase substituted bases randomly across the target template with no obvious hot spots or clustering around particular sequences. qβ replicase showed an equal preference for inserting a/t or g/c changes, with minimal bias for transitions over transversions .

the background error rate  was measured by sequencing  <dig>  base-pairs from the control reaction. only a single point mutation was detected which was consistent with the predicted error rate expected from a combination of taq dna polymerase  and the error rate contributed by reverse transcriptase . together, taq dna polymerase and superscript iii™ did not significantly contribute to the observed mutation rate seen with qβ replicase which in this example was in the order of ~ <dig> × 10- <dig> 

the mutational spectrum of qβ replicase compiled on the rgs was directly compared with three dna-based protocols traditionally used to randomly mutate dna and generate variant libraries. two common protocols of ep-pcr  and mutazymer ii dna polymerase , a recent blend of two different error-prone polymerases that is claimed to produce an even, non-biased spread of mutations , were used to mutate the rgs as outlined above. our analysis showed that ep-pcr exhibited a typical and well documented bias for a/t over g/c changes and a strong preference for transitions over transversions  <cit> . both ep-pcr protocols gave similar mutation patterns. mut ii showed a somewhat reduced preference for transitions over transversions but still strongly favored a/t changes over g/c changes .

using rna-based mutagenesis to engineer the specificity of tem- <dig> β-lactamase
as an example of the efficacy of qβ replicase for generating diverse mrna libraries, and to provide a direct comparison with published reports of protein evolution using other mutagenesis methods, qβ replicase mutagenesis was used to modify the well-characterized tem- <dig> β-lactamase antibiotic resistance protein of e. coli. although tem- <dig> β-lactamase has broad substrate specificity  <cit> , it can not efficiently hydrolyze the extended-spectrum, third generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime  <cit> . for instance, when wild-type β-lactamase is expressed in e. coli from the plasmid puc <dig>  the minimum inhibitory concentration  for cefotaxime is  <dig>  ug/ml. to modify the ability of β-lactamase to hydrolyze cefotaxime, the protein coding sequence was cloned from the plasmid puc <dig> into pegx <dig>  transcribed to synthesize mrna, and the mrna was then mutated with qβ replicase. the mutated mrna was converted to cdna using reverse transcriptase, cloned into a modified puc <dig> plasmid  and transformed into e. coli. clones were selected for growth on agar plates containing increasing concentrations of cefotaxime.

resistant colonies chosen after the first round of mutagenesis and selection had a mic of  <dig> ug/ml  indicating a 1000-fold increase in cefotaxime resistance. ten clones in total were sequenced yielding five variants. all clones carried the g238s amino acid substitution with  <dig> clones showing no other mutations. five clones carried two mutations; e104k and g238s . the remaining  <dig> clones carried the g238s mutation in combination with either f22s , h153r  or s267g . these five variants were used as the basis for the next round of mutagenesis and selection. the mrna that was generated from each of the variants was mixed together in equal proportions and taken through a second round of mutagenesis and selection as outlined previously with round one. resistant clones from the second round had a mic of at least  <dig> ug/ml  constituting a minimum  <dig> -fold increase in cefotaxime resistance. again, ten clones were sequenced with all clones carrying in combination with the round  <dig> mutations e104k and g238s, an extra mutation, m182t  with no silent or other mutations. these three mutations have been described in previous studies of β-lactamase evolution  <cit> . interesting to note that two of the key amino acid mutations resulted from g->a substitutions which would be well represented in a qβ replicase generated library  and less frequent with error-prone pcr  or mut ii .

note that control experiments performed with mrna treated in an identical fashion to that described above, however, not mutated with qβ replicase, did not yield any cefotaxime resistant variants at the concentrations of cefotaxime used for selection.

coupling rna-based mutagenesis to ribosome display
qβ replicase-generated mrna libraries were directly coupled to ribosome display and used to successfully affinity mature a number of small protein ligands . described here is the affinity optimization of a vnar that is based on the antibody-like ig new antigen receptor unique to sharks  <cit> . these single domain antibody-like fragments have been reported to bind to their targets via a single, long, finger like loop . a vnar ii family member, 12y- <dig>  originally isolated by nuttall and coworkers  <cit> , binds to ama- <dig>  a single, trans-membrane domain protein that is thought to be essential for binding and penetration of the plasmodium falciparum  parasite  into red blood cells  <cit> . peptides that bind to ama- <dig> have been shown to prevent merozoite invasion  <cit>  suggesting that ama- <dig> binders such as 12y- <dig> may be biologically useful tools. 12y- <dig>  however, has only a modest affinity for ama- <dig> in the order of  <dig> nm  making it an ideal candidate for affinity maturation.

the protein-coding sequence of 12y- <dig> was cloned into the mutagenesis/ribosome display plasmid pegx <dig>  transcribed to synthesize mrna, and the mrna subsequently mutated with qβ replicase. the mutated mrna was used directly in ribosome display. one round of selection via ribosome display was performed; the mrna was recovered and cloned into an expression vector and transformed into e. coli. a total of  <dig> clones were analyzed for binding to ama- <dig> by elisa. a range of variants with affinity increases in the order of 3–7-fold were recovered. one of these clones contained a single mutation k61r  mapping to framework region  <dig>  this variant was subjected to a second round of qβ replicase mutagenesis and selection via ribosome display, and again, a total of  <dig> round  <dig> clones were analyzed. the best variant identified after this second round  had a 22-fold increase in binding affinity  compared with the 12y- <dig> parent molecule with an approximate 2-fold increase in the association rate and a 13-fold increase in the dissociation rate  <cit> ). 1a- <dig> contained two mutations; the parent k61r mutation  and p90l  generated in the second round. the p90l mutation has also been recently described by nuttall and co-workers  <cit>  and maps to the cdr3-like region. western blot analysis and gel filtration chromatography indicated that the expression and monomeric state of 1a- <dig> appeared unchanged from the starting 12y- <dig> parent .

discussion
in this report, we have outlined an rna mutagenesis method that was specifically developed to provide an improved approach for the in vitro evolution of proteins, in particular, as an effective tool that can be coupled to ribosome display. the rna-based method is as simple and convenient as pcr to perform and generates a close to ideal random mutational spectrum. further, qβ replicase is not only error prone, but also highly processive and productive  <cit>  with reactions containing  <dig> ng of recombinant template mrna yielding over  <dig> μg of double-stranded rna product in  <dig> minutes. consequently, amplification and mutation can be achieved rapidly in a single step.

as a practical demonstration of the effectiveness of the mrna libraries generated with qβ replicase, we used the method to alter the substrate specificity of β-lactamase. several other groups have evolved β-lactamase using a variety of mutagenesis approaches in an attempt to increase the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze cefotaxime. these studies serve as a solid basis for the evaluation of the data presented here. a comparison is reasonably straight forward as the downstream selection for improved cefotaxime resistance is based on a simple functional assay for growth on an agar plate in the presence of increasing concentrations of cefotaxime, which is expected to be equivalent between laboratories.

as noted above, the cefotaxime mic for e. coli carrying a wild-type β-lactamase plasmid is typically around  <dig>  ug/ml. in one of the early examples of β-lactamase protein engineering, palzkill & botstein  <cit>  used cassette mutagenesis to isolate variants with a maximum mic of  <dig>  ug/ml. later, stemmer  <cit>  used three rounds of dna shuffling and  <dig> rounds of back-crossing to yield a tem- <dig> variant with an mic of  <dig> ug/ml. this cefotaxime resistant mutant contained six amino acid changes  and an engineered promoter mutation located between the - <dig> and - <dig> sites of the β-lactamase p <dig> promoter that increased β-lactamase expression levels by 2–3-fold. finally, zaccolo and gherardi  <cit>  isolated tem-1β-lactamase variants with activity against cefotaxime that was reported to be  <dig> -fold higher  than wild-type tem- <dig> by screening small pools of hyper-mutated clones  from libraries containing up to  <dig> nucleotide substitutions per gene. zaccolo and gherardi  <cit>  required  <dig> rounds of mutagenesis and selection to isolate clones containing the mutations e104k, g238s and m182t,  <dig> silent mutations, and a mutation in the pbr <dig> promoter region. we presume that our second round clones isolated in this study were comparable to the highly resistant zaccolo and gherardi clone since the same amino acid substitutions were selected in both studies . interesting to note that the unselected tem- <dig> libraries of zaccolo and gherardi contained a mean mutation frequency of  <dig>  and  <dig>  substitutions per gene length, however, clones selected on the basis of cefotaxine resisitance showed only 1– <dig> mutations at the dna level. it is clear that although increasing the mutation rate allowed a greater diversity to be sampled, it was from the sequences that carried the least number of mutations that functional variants were isolated  <cit> .

this report highlights the efficiency of the qβ replicase rna methodology. comparable cefotaxime resistant variants were selected relatively quickly  and with no silent or other superfluous mutations, an approach that was accomplished through what we have termed a "minimal mutational pathway". this approach is based on the premise that a small number of key amino acid substitutions at crucial positions can have a dramatic effect on the properties of the protein. this type of strategy can only be successfully applied when a low, unbiased mutation frequency is used to generate a large number of extremely diverse variants that allow for complete sampling of the immediate sequence space neighborhood. moore and maranas  <cit>  noted that base substitution bias introduced by taq dna polymerase under error-prone conditions would render some variants more likely than others, effectively reducing the overall library diversity. patrick and coworkers hypothesised  <cit>  that given that directed evolution is most likely to identify an improved variant when a library is maximally diverse, this would certainly be the case when all variants in a library are equally probable.

the minimal mutational pathway also provides a number of other significant advantages. due to the relatively low mutation rate, variants have few, if any superfluous or silent base changes, ensuring that a significant fraction of the variant pool being screened is functional. by minimizing the introduction of unnecessary amino acid changes, the method also avoids collateral damage to proteins. unnecessary amino acid substitutions can have significant negative effects on a target protein including increased immunogenicity  <cit> , a reduction in expression level and protein stability  <cit> , amongst others. in particular, altering the immunogenicity status of a protein can have a significant downstream impact on the effectiveness of a product as a potential therapeutic  <cit> .

without doubt, one of the significant advantages of a rna-based mutagenesis strategy is the potential to convey variant mrna libraries directly into selection approaches such as ribosome display with little intervention, therefore maintaining maximum library diversity during the selection process. the effectiveness of qβ replicase-generated mrna libraries coupled to ribosome display was demonstrated by affinity maturing 12y- <dig>  two discrete rounds of qβ replicase mutagenesis and ribosome display yielded the 1a- <dig> mutant that showed a 22-fold increase in binding to ama- <dig> relative to the 12y- <dig> parent molecule. 12y- <dig> has also been affinity-matured by nuttall and colleagues  <cit>  using ep-pcr and  <dig> rounds of selection via phage display. this group isolated several mutants of 12y- <dig> with the best of these variants carrying the p90l mutation and showing an 8-fold enhanced affinity for ama- <dig> 

apart from demonstrating the relative efficiency of the qβ replicase mutagenesis approach, the 1a- <dig> example is also highlighted here to illustrate the potential difficulties that challenge directed antibody or protein engineering strategies that focus mutagenesis on predicted target contact regions alone. the structure of 12y- <dig> has recently been published and the authors suggest that the binding of 12y- <dig> is essentially mediated via the relatively long cdr3-equivalent loop  <cit> . while amino acid  <dig> falls within the expected attachment region in this loop, the k61r mutation is situated along the exposed flank of the vnar, apparently outside the antigen-binding paratope. our finding suggests that the k61r mutation may either rotate or flex cdr <dig> and improve the interaction of cdr <dig> with ama- <dig> or that this distal exposed site may in fact have a significant functional role in the binding interaction by making contact with peripheral remote locations on ama- <dig> relative to the epitope targeted by cdr <dig>  <cit> . potentially, the k61r mutation may fall within an additional hyper-variable region that forms a belt around the periphery of the molecule  <cit> . this additional hyper-variable region may be an important consideration when engineering the affinity of ignars in general. certainly, a directed protein engineering approach exclusively targeting the extended cdr <dig> loop would not have identified the 1a- <dig> variant.

CONCLUSIONS
the success of the minimal mutation pathway approach to protein optimization presented here may be pertinent in light of the debate in the literature over the benefits of exploiting large random libraries created at a low mutation frequency versus smaller libraries manufactured using saturation mutagenesis  <cit> . our data suggests that the nature and diversity of mutations generated within a gene library governs the outcome, and not the mutation frequency per se- the wider the spectrum of single amino acid variations that are generated along the gene length , which can then be sampled from a library, the more likely that the best possible amino acid changes required for improving protein properties will be identified. the practical implications of our results are that suitable improved protein candidates generated through in vitro protein optimization technologies can be selected using significantly fewer rounds of mutagenesis and selection, and with little or no collateral damage to the protein or its mrna.
