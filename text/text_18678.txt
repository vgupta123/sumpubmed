BACKGROUND
the pancreas is a multifunctional organ that is critical for maintaining glucose homeostasis and for producing many of the enzymes required for digestion of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. to carry out these diverse functions, the pancreas contains three major tissue types: the exocrine acinar cells, the endocrine cells that comprise the islet of langerhans, and the ductal epithelial cells. although each of these pancreatic components performs unique functions, all are derived from a defined set of endodermally-derived progenitors  <cit> . subsequent pancreatic morphogenesis and differentiation of these progenitor populations is dependent on the concerted action of multiple transcriptional regulators. early during pancreatic bud evagination, pancreatic duodenal homeobox  <dig>  and pancreatic transcription factor 1a  are co-expressed in the pancreatic progenitor population  <cit> . ptf1a, a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor, becomes restricted to the exocrine cell population, where it is essential for exocrine cell formation and function  <cit> . pdx <dig> expression is maintained throughout the early pancreatic epithelium and becomes mostly restricted to β and δ cells after the secondary transition, although low levels of pdx <dig> persist in some acinar cells into adulthood  <cit> . pdx <dig> has distinct functions at each developmental stage and in each of the cell types where it is expressed, and itself is critically dependent on the winged helix transcription factors foxa <dig> and foxa <dig>  <cit> . ngn <dig>  a bhlh transcription factor, is required downstream of pdx <dig> to activate the endocrine differentiation program  <cit> . further islet cell fate determination in the ngn3+ cells then depends on a number of additional transcription factors including pdx <dig>  nkx <dig> , pax <dig>  pax <dig>  isl <dig>  neurod <dig>  arx, and nkx <dig> , each of which has been identified and characterized through genetic deletion or overexpression studies  <cit> . these and other transcription factors are then necessary for appropriate neogenesis, differentiation, and maturation of the five islet cell types .

although much is known about the identity, expression and function of many of the intrinsic regulatory proteins involved in pancreatic development and differentiation, the identification of downstream targets of these transcription factors to mediate these developmental events has proven to be more challenging. in efforts to identify downstream functional players during pancreagenesis, multiple groups have determined pancreatic gene expression profiles of wild type and transcription factor knockout models, including pdx <dig>  ngn <dig>  neurod <dig>  and foxa <dig>  <cit> . alternatively, temporal comparisons between transcription factor positive cell populations, such as pdx1+ or ngn3+  <cit> , by microarray analysis have also uncovered important downstream factors. here we present the first study comparing gene expression alterations between wild type and nkx <dig> -/- mouse pancreata at e <dig>  and e <dig> , the stages marking the onset of the secondary transition when the major wave of islet cell type specification events occur for both endocrine and exocrine pancreas.

nkx <dig>  is a homeodomain containing transcription factor critical for endocrine pancreas specification  <cit> . prior to e <dig> , the pancreas of nkx <dig> -/- mice appears overtly normal and contains wild type numbers of undifferentiated pdx1+ pancreatic epithelium and ngn3+ endocrine progenitor cells  <cit> . as development proceeds, the nkx <dig> -/- mice form the normal numbers of total endocrine and exocrine cells; however, within the endocrine compartment all β cells, most α cells and a subset of pp cells fail to differentiate and are replaced by a ghrelin-producing cell population, which persists to comprise the majority of a misshapen islet. nkx <dig> -/- mice die within days after birth with severe hyperglycemia  <cit> . nkx <dig>  expression is initiated at e <dig>  in the dorsal pancreas and e <dig>  in the ventral pancreas, shortly after the activation of pdx <dig> in each anlage  <cit> . high level nkx <dig>  expression subsequently becomes restricted to the centralized epithelium at e <dig> , where it is upregulated in a large number of the ngn3+ endocrine progenitor cells  <cit> . cells expressing low levels of nkx <dig>  are also apparent throughout the undifferentiated pancreatic epithelial population until after the secondary transition  <cit> . multiple in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that nkx <dig>  mediates early islet cell fate decisions by functioning both as a transcriptional repressor and activator, depending on temporal and cellular context  <cit> . to date, however, mafa and insulin  are the only two verified direct targets identified downstream of nkx <dig>  in the pancreas  <cit> . mafa and ins <dig> both represent mature β cell genes; the molecular mechanisms by which nkx <dig>  controls early endocrine specification remain largely unknown. in an effort to identify downstream direct and indirect targets of nkx <dig>  that promote or inhibit appropriate islet cell differentiation, we performed microarray analyses at e <dig>  and e <dig>  during pancreas development. this analysis has resulted in the identification and characterization of expression differences for several known and previously uncharacterized pancreatic genes. these studies clarify the position of nkx <dig>  within the known transcription factor network that regulates islet specification. furthermore, we have identified a novel role for nkx <dig>  in the regulation of several exocrine-specific genes, suggesting that nkx <dig>  may also function to influence gene expression in the early pdx1+ ptf1a+ pancreatic progenitor cell.

RESULTS
gene expression differences between wild type and nkx <dig> -/- pancreata
to identify genes that function downstream of nkx <dig>  during early pancreas development, we compared gene expression profiles of e <dig>  or e <dig>  wild type and nkx <dig> -/- pancreata. we restricted our analysis to the onset of the secondary transition, when the principal wave of endocrine differentiation begins, to enrich for downstream direct and indirect targets of nkx <dig>  that are involved in the early events of islet cell type specification. global gene profiling at these time points also allowed us to minimize gene expression differences caused by the islet cell type conversions that occur later in the nkx <dig> -/- mice. in addition, between e <dig>  and e <dig> , nkx <dig>  is expressed broadly throughout the undifferentiated pancreatic epithelium, which is present in comparable amounts between wild type and nkx <dig> -/- pancreata . this allows for the enrichment of equal quantities of wild type and mutant tissue that would normally contain a high percentage of nkx <dig> -expressing cells.

pools of cdna generated from e <dig>  and e <dig>  pancreata  were amplified, labeled and hybridized to pancchip  <dig>   microarrays containing  <dig>  mouse cdnas  <cit> . both statistical significance  and a fold change threshold of  <dig>  were used to select genes for further verification and analysis. at e <dig> ,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed, of which  <dig> were downregulated and  <dig> upregulated in nkx <dig> -/- pancreata compared to wild type . by e <dig> , an additional  <dig> genes were downregulated, which may begin to reflect the differences in islet cell type populations between wild type and nkx <dig> -/- mice and/or may be due to the identification of additional direct or secondary downstream nkx <dig>  targets . we used gene ontology  terms to categorize the protein products of genes misregulated in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas . many of the genes encode proteins not previously identified in the pancreas, as well as known pancreatic factors. as expected, we saw a large decrease in nkx <dig>  expression, as well as significant changes in the expression of glucagon, insulin and ghrelin . as further validation of the experimental approach and microarray platform, we used quantitative real-time pcr to verify many of the altered genes that represented several classes of proteins. of those tested,  <dig> % displayed expression changes that corresponded well with the microarray analysis , closely reflecting the 20% fdr used as a statistical cutoff. below we discuss the further characterization of a select subset of genes with altered expression using quantitative real-time pcr  to compare their gene expression levels and mrna in situ analysis to compare their spatial localization in wild type versus nkx <dig> -/- pancreata.

 <dig> genes were downregulated in nkx <dig> -/- pancreata at e <dig>  when compared to wild type. genes were identified using pancchip  <dig>  microarray analysis. statistical significance of 20% fdr and a fold change of  <dig>  were used as cutoffs for determining expression changes. genes were categorized based on function determined by gene ontology  term associations.

 <dig> genes were upregulated in nkx <dig> -/- pancreata at e <dig>  and e <dig> . genes were identified using pancchip  <dig>  microarray analysis and a fold change of  <dig>  was used as a cutoff for determining expression changes. genes were categorized based on function determined by gene ontology  term associations.

 <dig> additional genes were downregulated in nkx <dig> -/- pancreata at e <dig> . genes were identified using pancchip  <dig>  microarray analysis and a fold change of  <dig>  was used as a cutoff for determining expression changes. genes were categorized based on function determined by gene ontology  term associations.

altered expression of genes encoding transcription factors
interestingly, a relatively large proportion  of downregulated genes in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas are transcription factors , whereas no transcription factors were found to be significantly upregulated . six of the nine transcription factors were confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr  ; expression of irx <dig>  hes <dig> and irf <dig> did not appear to be changed in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas at e <dig> , e <dig> , or e <dig>  . of the genes with altered expression, it appears that several encode transcription factors that are critical during early islet cell fate specification, including ngn <dig>  myt <dig>  neurod <dig>  and mafb.

ngn <dig> is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for the formation of the endocrine islet cell population  <cit> . ngn <dig> expression defines the endocrine progenitor cell and several knockout and lineage tracing studies have determined that ngn <dig> is required for the specification of all five endocrine cell types  <cit> . nkx <dig>  and ngn <dig> are co-expressed in the endocrine progenitor cell and in the absence of ngn <dig>  nkx <dig>  expression in these cells is lost  <cit> . in the absence of nkx <dig> , ngn3+ cell numbers remain unchanged , but there appears to be a significant and sustained reduction of ngn <dig> expression . these combined results suggest that ngn <dig> and nkx <dig>  function in a co-regulatory loop, and maintenance of their respective expression levels within the progenitor cell may be necessary to specify appropriate islet cell fates. not surprisingly, myelin transcription factor  <dig> , a downstream target of ngn <dig>  <cit> , is significantly reduced in the nkx <dig> -/- mice. myt <dig> has also been shown to be important for appropriate endocrine pancreas differentiation and, at e <dig> , over 60% of ngn3+ cells also express myt <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, myt <dig> and ngn <dig> are believed to form a feed-forward loop to promote endocrine differentiation  <cit> . a significant reduction of myt <dig> expression in the nkx <dig> -/- mice is not apparent until e <dig> , which may suggest that its down-regulation is secondary to the loss of ngn <dig>  qrtpcr analysis confirmed that myt <dig> expression becomes decreased at e <dig>  and the reduction in expression is maintained throughout gestation . rna in situ hybridization analysis at e <dig>  and e <dig>  further verified decreased myt <dig> expression throughout the pancreatic epithelium . in summary, our data suggest that nkx <dig>  functions within the myt <dig> and ngn <dig> regulatory loop. future studies will elaborate the precise regulatory connections between these three factors to specify appropriate islet cell fate decisions.

neurod <dig> is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that has also been shown to function directly downstream of ngn <dig>  consistent with the reduction of ngn <dig> expression, neurod <dig> is downregulated in the nkx <dig> -/- mice . furthermore, we have recently determined that nkx <dig>  and ngn <dig> cooperate to directly activate the neurod <dig> promoter  <cit> , suggesting that the reduction of neurod <dig> expression could be caused by both direct and indirect regulation. previous experiments also indicate that nkx <dig>  and neurod <dig> genetically interact in the alpha cell population  <cit> . it is likely that these complex regulatory and functional interactions between nkx <dig> , ngn <dig>  myt <dig> and neurod <dig> are necessary to precisely control early islet cell fate decisions.

we also detected a significant reduction in mafb expression. two members of the large maf transcription factor family, mafa and mafb, are important for endocrine pancreas development  <cit> . mafa, a mature β cell marker, is a direct transcriptional target of nkx <dig>  and its expression is absent in nkx <dig> -/- mice  <cit> . in this study, the comparative gene expression analysis was performed at a time point prior to mafa expression in the pancreas  and therefore mafa was not included on our list of downregulated genes. mafb is expressed prior to mafa and is critical for appropriate differentiation of α and β cells  <cit> . here we demonstrate that mafb expression is decreased in nkx <dig> -/- mice at e <dig>  . further verification by qrtpcr confirmed that decreased expression of mafb was maintained throughout gestation, with the largest observed differences occurring at e <dig>  . although it is possible that the reduction in mafb expression is due to the loss of α and β cells, as shown by a reduction of mafb+ cells at e <dig>  , mafb in situ hybridization analysis suggests that mafb expression is also reduced on a per cell basis throughout the pancreatic epithelium . we have also determined that nkx <dig>  binds directly to a highly conserved dna sequence within the mafb 5' upstream regulatory region , suggesting that nkx <dig>  may regulate both mafa and mafb to impact the early specification of α and β cells in addition to their proper maturation state.

isl <dig> and etv <dig>  show differential expression by e <dig>  in the nkx <dig> -/- mice . isl <dig> is necessary for dorsal pancreatic mesenchyme and endocrine cell differentiation  <cit> . etv <dig>  an ets domain family member, is expressed in the pancreas  <cit> ; however, its function during pancreas organogenesis remains unknown. etv <dig> is important in neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis  <cit>  and has recently been shown to form a transcriptional complex with sox <dig>  a characterized pancreatic progenitor marker, in breast cancer cells  <cit> . interestingly, isl <dig>  and etv <dig> appear to be shared downstream  targets of nkx <dig>  and ngn <dig> . the complex regulatory relationship between nkx <dig>  and ngn <dig> suggests that these factors function in the same pathway or in parallel to regulate isl <dig> and etv <dig>  further elucidation of the co-regulatory pathways and intricate feedback mechanisms that we have uncovered in these studies will facilitate our understanding of elaborate transcriptional networks that regulate islet cell fate decisions.

altered expression of genes encoding transmembrane and secreted factors
two particularly interesting classes of genes that displayed altered regulation in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas are transmembrane proteins  and secreted factors . these classes of proteins are particularly interesting because they have the potential to interface with environmental and extracellular signals to direct cellular function. to determine whether these gene alterations were due to the loss or gain of specific cell types, or due to aberrant ectopic expression, we analyzed gene expression changes over the course of embryonic development and performed mrna in situ analysis to define their spatial localization within the pancreas.

the transmembrane protein tmem <dig>  also known as collectrin, is expressed in multiple endocrine cell types during development, including α and β cells, but becomes restricted to β cells in the adult where it functions to increase β cell proliferation in vivo  <cit> . tmem <dig> expression is increased in hypertrophied islets and has been shown to function in β cell lines and primary β cells to enhance glucose stimulated insulin secretion  <cit> . however, in vivo loss of tmem <dig> did not affect overall islet number, β cell mass, or function; islet composition was not assessed in this study  <cit> . as would be expected of a factor that is expressed in α and β cells during development, tmem <dig> is significantly reduced in e <dig>  and e <dig>  nkx <dig> -/- mice, which have less α cells and completely lack β cells . unexpectedly, however, by late gestation tmem <dig> transcript is expressed at equivalent levels throughout the endocrine compartment in wild type and nkx <dig> -/- pancreas, as measured both by qrtpcr  and rna in situ hybridization analysis . furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of tmem <dig> and ghrelin on adjacent sections of e <dig>  wild type and nkx <dig> -/- pancreas  confirm that some ghrelin cells normally co-express tmem <dig> and this expression is maintained in the nkx <dig> -/- ghrelin-expressing population. therefore, the early reduction in tmem <dig> expression in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas could be attributed to the absence of the α and β cell populations, and the restoration of normal tmem <dig> expression levels could be due to its expression in the ghrelin cell population that has now replaced the missing islet cell types. however, this does not account for the loss of tmem <dig> expression during midgestation  when the replacement ghrelin cells have already formed. this would suggest that there is a transient reduction or loss of tmem <dig> expression in mutant pancreas during the secondary transition that may contribute to, or be caused by, the cell fate switch that is occurring in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas.

in contrast to tmem <dig>  adra2a, a g-protein coupled receptor, has increased expression early in nkx <dig> -/- pancreas development, but becomes decreased in late nkx <dig> -/- pancreas . adra2a is normally expressed in pancreatic islets  <cit>  where it functions as a β cell postsynaptic receptor to inhibit insulin secretion  <cit> . the loss of adra2a expression late in gestation is consistent with the absence of β cells. however, the elevated expression of adra2a in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas between e <dig>  - e <dig>   suggests that adra2a might also be expressed in non-β cell populations prior to β cell formation. the early adra2a gene expression changes that occur in response to loss of nkx <dig>  activity may be indicative of a functional role for adra2a outside of the β cell.

one of the most highly upregulated genes identified in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas by the microarray analysis is tm4sf <dig>  a member of the l <dig> domain superfamily of tetraspanin surface proteins  <cit> . tm4sf <dig> is expressed in non-dividing hepatocytes  <cit>  and the human orthologue, il-tmp, is found in non-dividing intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . expression of tm4sf <dig> in the pancreas has not been previously reported. our analysis shows that in wild type pancreas, tm4sf <dig> is normally expressed at low levels throughout the pancreatic epithelium at all stages examined . furthermore, tm4sf <dig> is enriched in facs-purified ngn3-egfp cells  and is upregulated in pancreata that have undergone exocrine to endocrine reprogramming  <cit> . in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas, qrtpcr and mrna in situ analysis demonstrated that tm4sf <dig> expression is increased in the pancreas throughout gestation . at early stages of pancreas specification, tm4sf <dig> appears to be broadly expressed throughout the nkx <dig> -/- pancreatic epithelium , but beginning at e <dig> , tm4sf <dig> mrna becomes restricted to the ductal and endocrine compartment in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreata . interestingly, at e <dig>  we observed a subpopulation of tm4sf4+ cells in nkx <dig> -/- pancreata that appear to express extremely high levels of tm4sf <dig> within the ductal epithelium . antibodies against tm4sf <dig> are not available to precisely determine cell type localization; however, analysis of tm4sf <dig> mrna and ghrelin protein expression on adjacent sections demonstrates that tm4sf <dig> is restricted to the ductal and endocrine compartments, and partially co-localizes with the ghrelin population in the e <dig>  nkx <dig> -/- pancreas . future studies will focus on pancreatic cell type expression and subcellular localization of tm4sf <dig>  closely-related tm4sf <dig> family members and other tetraspanins are known to interact with integrins, and are often involved in emt, cell adhesion mechanisms and/or migration events  <cit> . since tm4sf <dig> appears to be enriched in the ngn3+ cell population and is one of the most highly upregulated genes in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreata, we speculate that the aberrant upregulation of tm4sf <dig> in the endocrine progenitor cells of the nkx <dig> -/- mice may interfere with normal cell-cell interactions and/or the interpretation of extrinsic signals to prevent appropriate islet cell differentiation. furthermore, the tm4sf <dig> gene contains two highly conserved nkx <dig>  binding sites , suggesting that tm4sf <dig> might function directly downstream of nkx <dig>  in the progenitor population to modulate islet cell fate choice.

altered expression of exocrine genes
surprisingly, although we had not previously detected a change in exocrine cell numbers, several genes expressed in the exocrine compartment also display altered expression in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas. the nkx <dig> -/- mice do not display overt exocrine pancreatic defects  <cit> ; however, nkx <dig>  is initially co-expressed with pdx <dig> and ptf1a in the pancreatic progenitors that give rise to all the pancreatic cell types. it is therefore possible that nkx <dig>  plays a transient role in exocrine gene regulation. whether these gene expression changes translate into functional defects cannot be determined in the nkx <dig> -/- animals, which die shortly after birth.

elastase  <dig>  is a digestive enzyme produced within the pancreatic acini  <cit> . in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreata, ela <dig> appears to be upregulated as early as e <dig>  when both exocrine and endocrine cell types are differentiating, but prior to acini maturation . we confirmed elevated mrna expression at e <dig>  and e <dig>  by qrtpcr  and demonstrated that the elevated ela <dig> was restricted to the exocrine compartment at e <dig>  and e <dig>  using mrna in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analysis . it therefore appears that there may be an increase in elastase expression per cell, rather than ectopic expression of elastase.

nephrocan , a secreted glycoprotein of the kidney that can inhibit tgfβ signaling and is important for a variety of essential developmental events including epithelial to mesenchymal transitions  and cell migration  <cit> , also displays increased expression in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas at e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig>  . nepn has not been previously reported in the pancreas, however, in both wild type and nkx <dig> -/- pancreas, nepn expression is detectable in the exocrine compartment and overlaps with the elastase expression domain . in the embryonic kidney, nepn is expressed transiently, with its highest expression levels peaking at e <dig>   <cit> . similarly, in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas, we could detect a large increase in nepn expression between e <dig>  and e <dig> , but by e <dig>  nepn expression could not be detected by either qrtpcr or mrna in situ analysis . furthermore, in both wild type and nkx <dig> -/- pancreas nepn mrna expression was already considerably lower at e <dig>  when compared to e <dig> , although even at e <dig> , nepn levels were still significantly higher in the mutant pancreas compared to wild type . this would suggest that nepn is transiently upregulated in the exocrine pancreas of the nkx <dig> -/- mice.

the exocrine gene serine protease inhibitor kazal type  <dig>   <cit>  is also affected in nkx <dig> -/- pancreata, but unlike ela <dig> and nepn, spink <dig> is downregulated in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas at e <dig>  . in wild type pancreas, spink <dig> mrna can be detected as early as e <dig>  and is expressed in acini by e <dig>  continuing through e <dig> . spink <dig> is also expressed in the intestine, kidney, and some reproductive tissues during embryogenesis  <cit> . recent functional analysis suggests that spink <dig> has essential roles in the maintenance of the integrity and regeneration of acinar cells. qrtpcr and in situ hybridization of spink <dig> mrna levels in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas confirmed the downregulation of spink <dig> at e <dig>   and e <dig>  . spink <dig> mrna levels in wild type and nkx <dig>  null pancreata appear to equilibrate between e <dig>  and e <dig>  , suggesting that the upregulation of spink <dig> is a transient event.

a number of additional known exocrine genes are also downregulated in the nkx <dig> -/- mice at e <dig> , including pancreatic lipase-related protein, chymotrypsinogen b <dig> and carboxypeptidase  <dig> . there are no overt changes in the number of exocrine cells or their morphology and polarity in the nkx <dig> -/- mice to suggest a defect in the formation of the exocrine cell population  <cit> . furthermore, nkx <dig>  expression normally becomes extinguished in the differentiated acini cells. we predict that the observed exocrine gene expression changes reflect differences in the regulation of these genes in the pancreatic progenitor population. it is possible that these gene expression changes are transient  or, alternatively, they may initiate events that lead to persistent functional changes in the acini that are as yet uncharacterized.

CONCLUSIONS
although the nkx <dig> -/- mice display a severe islet cell misspecification phenotype, our microarray studies identified very few altered transcription factor changes that contribute to these changes during the secondary transition. what the global gene expression profiling suggests, however, is that nkx <dig>  plays a predominant role in regulating islet cell fate choices within the ngn <dig> regulatory circuit. nkx <dig>  is not likely to function upstream of this regulatory junction, since the loss of nkx <dig>  does not affect the expression of pdx <dig>  ptfl1a or sox <dig> . we do, however, demonstrate that ngn <dig> and its functional partners, myt <dig> and neurod <dig>  all have reduced expression in nkx <dig> -/- mice. the reduction of myt <dig> and neurod <dig> may be secondary to the reduction of ngn3; however, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that the regulatory and functional inter-relationships between these proteins are more complex, as summarized in figure  <dig>  it has been demonstrated that nkx <dig>  expression is reduced in ngn3-/- mice indicating that these proteins function in a feedback loop  <cit> . furthermore, myt <dig> expression is decreased in ngn3-/- mice, but myt <dig> has also been shown to induce ngn <dig> activation, and myt <dig> and ngn <dig> apparently cooperate in their regulation of islet differentiation  <cit> . additional studies have demonstrated that ectopic expression of neurod <dig> activates nkx <dig>  and it has been suggested that ngn <dig> and nkx <dig>  autoregulate their own transcription  <cit> . these complex regulatory interactions are likely necessary to fine tune this critical juncture in islet cell specification. precise regulation of the expression levels and activity of each of these essential factors may be necessary for the appropriate initiation of the critical developmental events that function downstream of the ngn <dig> progenitor, including the regulation and co-regulation of downstream targets, such as mafb, isl <dig> and etv <dig>  rather than the simple linear regulatory pathway that is often invoked, an intricate web of feedback and feedforward regulation must be necessary to induce appropriate islet cell specification.

in this study, we have identified several known and novel secreted and transmembrane proteins that may function downstream of nkx <dig>  to mediate differentiation events. transmembrane proteins such as tm4sf <dig> or signaling molecules such as nephrocan may function in or on the endocrine progenitor cells to translate the cell's intrinsic signals to the environment or vice versa. the identification and characterization of transmembrane and secreted molecules that influence islet cell formation will provide critical information about the extrinsic signals that are necessary to manipulate pancreatic development and cell differentiation. in support of this, a recent study demonstrated the tetraspanin tm4sf <dig> mediates fusion of the dorsal and ventral buds, as well as acinar cell differentiation during xenopus pancreatic development  <cit> .

finally, these studies demonstrate for the first time that nkx <dig>  indirectly or directly regulates the expression of several exocrine genes. the functional impact caused by misregulation of these exocrine genes is not clear; however, it suggests that nkx <dig>  also plays a minor role in non-endocrine lineages. it is possible that the regulation of exocrine gene expression occurs in the "nkx <dig>  low" expressing cells that are present in the pdx1+, ngn3- pancreatic progenitors  <cit> . this is similar to the finding that deletion of nkx <dig> , a β cell transcription factor that is co-expressed with nkx <dig>  in the early pancreatic epithelium, transiently upregulates the expression of the exocrine factor nkx <dig>  in pdx1+ pancreatic progenitor cells  <cit> . misregulation of additional exocrine genes was not reported in the henseleit study. however, we have determined that nkx <dig>  is also upregulated in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas .

in summary, the results of our comparative expression analysis of nkx <dig> -/- and wild type pancreata begins to illustrate the cell type specific requirements for nkx <dig>  in the regulation of endocrine and exocrine gene expression and will ultimately help to dissect out the molecular functions of nkx <dig>  in regulating important pancreatic cell fate decisions.
