BACKGROUND
the gdsl motif enzyme is a relatively newly discovered lipase, with many characteristics that have not yet been fully, clearly, and precisely described  <cit> . since  <dig>  when upton and buckley first reported the new gds-motif-like subfamily of lipases , new questions have arisen about the specific functions of these fascinating lipolytic enzymes.

the number of lipases  and esterases  that have been studied tremendously increased over the last decades. the lipase and esterase families belong to hydrolases—a class of enzymes that shows very broad substrate specificity. all enzymes in these families contained a catalytic triad composed of serine , aspartic , and histidine  residues. the role of the nucleophile in lipases is played by a ser residue, which is a part of the highly conserved motif gly-x-ser-x-gly , positioned in the middle of the amino acid sequence. in contrast, enzymes that belong to the gdsl family of esterases/lipases share five blocks of highly conserved homology, which are important for their classification. the active-site ser is located close to the n-terminus. the gdsl family is further classified as sgnh hydrolase because of the presence of the strictly conserved residues ser-gly-asn-his in the conserved blocks i, ii, iii, and v  <cit> . two other proton donors to the oxidation hole are the glycine  residue in block ii and the asparagine  in block iii. the his amino acid in block v serves as a base that makes the ser in block i more nucleophilic by deprotonating the hydroxyl group. additional characteristic for block v is the presence of aspartate  three amino acids ahead of his . unlike other lipases, gdsl hydrolases have a flexible active site and they change conformation in the presence of different substrates; hence, some gdsl enzymes have broadly diverse enzymatic activities, including esterase and protease activity in the same enzyme  <cit> .

the gdsl esterases/lipases are found throughout all kingdoms of life. due to their broad substrate specificity, these highly promising enzymes can be potentially used for biotechnological application in a wide range of industries   <cit> . they have been previously identified in a wide range of organisms, and several gdsl ser esterases/lipases have been cloned and characterized. many gdsl esterases/lipases have been found in bacteria, and advancement has been made toward uncovering their structures, functions, and physiologic roles  <cit> . the enzymes of gdsl esterases/lipases have been cloned and characterized, and at present, the crystal structures from streptomyces scabiesescherichia colipseudomonas fluorescensmycobacterium smegmatis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are available  <cit> . their mature enzymes display expansive hydrolytic activity with different types of substrates, including acyl-coas, a variety of esters, and amino acid derivatives.

all the structures of the gdsl esterase/lipase that have been described to date belong to the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily of proteins. the main difference in folding from classical α/β hydrolase fold is a distinct location of the residues involved in active site formation, which direct to a different analogous orientation of the catalytic triad with regard to the central parallel β-sheet  <cit> . recently, the structure of the gdsl esterase/lipase proteins from several species of bacteria has been determined  <cit> , but no structure from plants has been resolved yet.

the gdsl esterases/lipases have been also found in plant species and have become very attractive subjects because of their newly discovered properties and functions. recently, in the plant kingdom, the novel family of the gdsl esterases/lipases is represented by more than  <dig> members from the twelve different fully sequenced plant genomes. it was reported that gdsl family from arabidopsis thaliana consists of  <dig> members  <cit> , and vitis vinifera, sorghum bicolourpopulus trichocarpa, and physcomitrella patens contain  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively  <cit> . search across multiple databases revealed  <dig> members from oryza sativa,  <dig> members from zea mays,  <dig> members from selaginella moellendorffii,  <dig> members from medicago truncatula,  <dig> members from chlamydomonas reinhardtii,  <dig> members from ostreococcus tauri, and  <dig> members from phaeodactylum tricornutum <cit> . several plant gdsl esterases/lipases have been isolated, cloned, and characterized. physiologically, the gdsl esterases/lipases that have been described so far are mainly involved in the regulation of plant development, morphogenesis, synthesis of secondary metabolites, and defence response  <cit> .

rice has become a model plant for genomic research of monocotyledonous species because of its small genomic size and economic importance, but our knowledge of the gdsl esterases/lipases gene family in rice is rather limited. although there are more than  <dig> members of the gdsl esterase/lipase family in the rice genome, only a few gdsl esterases/lipases genes have been studied and the functions and properties of the majority of members remain unknown. currently, only two rice gdsl esterases/lipases genes have been reported. gdsl-containing enzyme rice  <dig>  and wilted dwarf and lethal  <dig>  were cloned from the rice genome, and their physiologic functions were suggested as regulatory in coleoptile elongation and plant growth in the seedling stage, respectively  <cit> .

in the present study,  <dig> osgelp genes were identified in rice. this is the first bioinformatics genome-wide survey of the osgelp gene family with description of: the genomic distribution, gene structure of the osgelp genes, phylogenetic analysis, as well as motif analysis, and structure modelling for the osgelp proteins. more than  <dig> additional, clade-common and -specific peptide motifs outside the gdsl domain were uncovered, described, and their putative functionality based on the gdsl-lipase protein tertiary structure was proposed. potentially important regions for substrate specificity and binding, as well as functional grouping according to the phylogenetic relations are discussed. the expression patterns of some representative genes analysed by quantitative real-time pcr in response to cytokinin hormone treatment matched with the digital expression results. the results of the microarray expression profiling under the different treatment conditions, and the phylogenetic relatedness of the genes were analyzed in order to predict their functions in rice.

considering the fact that a very limited number of the osgelp genes have been characterized to date, results reported in this study is the first step towards the understanding of the roles of the gdsl esterases/lipases in rice, which provide a solid foundation for function predictions of possible roles of the gdsl enzymes in rice. our work introduces a fundamental framework for selection of appropriate candidate genes for the subsequent functional analysis of the osgelp family members.

RESULTS
identification of the gdsl esterase/lipase family genes in rice
a total of  <dig> putative osgelp genes were identified and designated as osgelp <dig> to osgelp <dig> based on their order and position in corresponding chromosomes 1– <dig> from top to bottom. their gene name, locus id, the accession numbers for coding sequences , genomic dna, cdna, and predicted isoelectric points of all the  <dig> osgelp genes are listed in additional file  <dig>  the open reading frame  sizes of the osgelp genes vary from 570 bp  to  <dig>  bp , with an average sequence length of  <dig>  bp.

most of the osgelp genes are expressed in various organs. ninety nine genes have one or more full-length cdna  and/or expressed sequence tags  . the expression of  <dig> other genes were confirmed by microarray data available at genevestigator  <cit> , and two  genes had only mpss data support . the number of mapped est sequences for the osgelp genes was quite variable, indicating marginal 1– <dig>  to strong  <dig> to > <dig>  expression .

up to  <dig> %  of the osgelp genes were predicted to be alternatively spliced by the rice genome annotation project  database . the osgelp genes are present in two to four alternatively spliced forms, giving rise to a total of  <dig> transcripts . this number is slightly higher than that predicted for rice genes overall  <cit> . the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts was confirmed by fl-cdna evidence . several annotation errors were observed in the automated annotation of the rice genome, including intron/exon numbers/positions that were corrected according to the rice fl-cdna sequences from the knowledge-based oryza molecular biological encyclopedia database   <cit> . for example, the annotation of two osgelp  genes were corrected. their structure annotations were changed from  <dig> exon/ <dig> intron into  <dig> exon/ <dig> intron, and  <dig> exon/ <dig> intron to  <dig> exon/ <dig> intron patterns. also, the predicted orf sizes were modified according to the availability of fl-cdna , from  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  and 846 bp, respectively.

chromosomal distribution, gene structure and evolutionary expansion of the osgelp genes
the chromosomal regions where the candidate genes reside vary in their size. their genomic sequence lengths range from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp due to the large introns . the intron sizes of  <dig> % of the osgelp genes appear to exceed  <dig>  bp. the osgelp <dig> and osgelp <dig> genes contain over 10-fold longer introns than the other genes in the family. the two huge introns from these genes,  <dig> , and  <dig>  bp, are consistent through all alternative splicing forms. within these long introns, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> repetitive elements were detected. these elements are represented by different types of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements, transposons, and retrotransposons. in general, the diverse repetitive sequences, from several superclasses with a variety of sizes, were discovered within introns, exons, and 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions  of  <dig> osgelp genes .

phylogenetic analysis and evolution of the osgelp genes
to study the evolutionary relationship of the members of the osgelp gene family, as well the phylogenetic relationship among the rice osgelp genes and other plant gdsl genes, whose putative functions were elucidated recently, the unrooted phylogenetic trees based on the multiple sequence alignment of their protein sequences were constructed by the neighbour-joining  method and displayed using the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis  program.

for the rice osgelp phylogenetic tree, a dataset of  <dig> protein sequences containing  <dig> conserved alignment regions were collected, including the special features of the gdsl esterase/lipase such as blocks i, ii, iii, and v. other  <dig> osgelp genes contain gap-rich regions. during evolution, they probably lost some common gdsl enzyme blocks, as well as other shared regions. for this reason, they were eliminated from further phylogenetic analyses .

the rice osgelp gene family was divided into four clades in the final unrooted phylogenetic tree construction . the result suggests that clades i and iv can be further subdivided into  <dig> subclades . the osgelp genes, that grouped together in the subclades conformed their predictional arrangement of segmental and tandemic duplication events. osgelps from  <dig> of the  <dig> genomic clusters were verified to have close phylogenetic relationships through their high node numbers . up to  <dig> osgelp genes comprise  <dig> sister pairs. a total of  <dig> pairs belong to  <dig> gene clusters and  <dig> pairs are segmentally duplicated genes . each subclade consists of one or more sister gene pairs. this suggests the major role of duplication events in the expansion of the osgelp gene family in the rice genome.

given that orthologs frequently hold an identical function  <cit> , our second unrooted nj phylogenetic tree combined  <dig> rice osgelp genes and  <dig> plant gdsl orthologs or homologs whose putative functions were annotated recently . according to the phylogenetic analysis, the osgelp genes and their close plant orthologs or homologs were divided into three major subfamilies represented by clades i, ii, and iii. in addition, clades i and iii each were separated into six subclades . among the plant gdsl esterases/lipases whose functions have been determined,  <dig> genes  were found as orthologs of the  <dig> osgelp genes . orthologs, as well as the close homologous proteins, share more than 40% similarity and assemble together in the same subclades of the phylogenetic tree. all  <dig> subclades of the osgelp tree order remained conserved in the newly generated conjoint plant gdsl esterase/lipase gene family tree constructed from a total of  <dig> members . locations of the plant gdsl genes that were chosen for our study coincided with the previously reported tree topology of the gdsl esterase/lipase gene family in land plants   <cit> .

of the four clades of the original rice osgelp phylogenetic tree, a new clade of the plant gdsl genes appeared. the emerging clade  is well supported by the bootstrap value  and consists of six members of the gdsl esterase/lipase genes from a. thalianabrassica rapa, and carica papaya, which have been shown to be correlated with different kinds of biotic stress responses, except one cpest gene   <cit> . the specific nature of clade ii in the tree can be explained by the association of the clade members with the myrosinase–glucosinolate system. this system is almost exclusive to the order capparales, which includes the brassicaceae plants  <cit> . this fact can account for separation of the group of genes in clade ii from the other clades in the phylogenetic tree, and every member shows relatively low similarity  to the osgelp genes .

relationship between protein motifs and phylogenetic classification
a total of  <dig> motifs with statistical significance  from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> were found among the osgelps and the known plant gdsl esterase/lipase proteins . motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> represent gdsl esterase/lipase conserved blocks i, ii, iii, and v, respectively . as expected, the presence of the common gdsl domain proteins, represented by the four blocks, affirms its major functional role. other well-conserved motifs outside the gdsl domain were also detected. significantly,  <dig> conserved motifs  with more than  <dig> but less than  <dig> amino acids in length are present in almost all proteins . the other  <dig> motifs were found to be specific to the different subclades of the gdsl esterase/lipase phylogenetic tree. we found that the gdsl proteins that cluster in clade i in the phylogenetic tree share a similar motif pattern , whereas there were no specific motifs for clade iii. at the same time, the subclades of clade iii demonstrate high diversity in specific motifs . most of the osgelp proteins that clustered together with homologs and/or orthologs in the same subclade share more than one additional conserved motifs outside the gdsl domain. motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are specific to subclades ia, ib, ic, and id, whereas motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> exclusively appear in subclade ie . subclades iiia, iiib, and iiid, iiie, iiif contain specific motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  respectively . subclades ia and ib exclusively contain motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. motif  <dig> is specific to subclade iiib. subclade iiie appears to have distinct motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  finally, five particular motifs  belong to subclade iiif .

the newly found additional, subclade-specific motifs were considered as novel, because there were no any statistically significant sequence similarities of our motifs with known motifs or possible function assignments within the prosite and uniprotkb/swiss-prot databases  <cit> .

distribution of the conserved motifs and their locations on the three-dimensional structure
we consider the possibility that the consensus regions outside of the motifs encoding gdsl esterase/lipase conserved blocks i, ii, iii, and v may contain functionally important motifs involved in substrate specificity, protein structure ordering and arrangement, protein–protein interaction, etc. such “supplemental” functional motifs often remain conserved among members of a subgroup in large families in plants  <cit> . thus, the proteins within the subgroups that share these motifs likely display similar functions. to find the three-dimensional orientation of these additional motifs, in order to support our functional prediction, the structure prediction were conducted on the osgelp proteins using the protein homology/analogy recognition engine  server  <cit> .

the structural homology detection showed four of the most closely homologous structures of the bacterial gdsl motif proteins. the lipase/acylhydrolase from enterococcus faecalis  showed 10%–15% similarity, esterase from streptomyces scabies  demonstrated 10%–14% similarity, and thioesterase i from e. coli  showed 15–18% similarity. finally, the general prediction model of the osgelp proteins was built using the x-ray structure of the aryl esterase from m. smegmatis , which showed the highest similarity from 17% to 19% .

the predicted basic structural model consists of six α-helices and a central β-sheet core containing six parallel β-strands . the active ser residue is located in the loop region  right after the first β-strand; meanwhile, in the bacterial structural model, ser appears in a short helical segment following the first β-strand. the aspartic acid and his residues, which together with ser form the catalytic triad, seems to hold the same location in plants and bacteria, and reside in the turn structure preceding the c-terminal α-helix . blocks ii and iii with their representative gly and asn residues, which act as proton donors to the oxyanion hole, are located in the unstructured regions following the second β-sheet and right after the third β-sheet, respectively, and designated in figure 5b as l <dig> and l <dig> 

moreover, many predicted putative motifs within the unstructured loop regions were observed to be specific to the members of phylogenetic clades i or iii and/or the subclades of these clades . three loops  can be specified as the most divergent in terms of motifs for the different osgelp phylogenetic groups that deviate in biological functions. these particular loops possibly play a role in differentiation of substrate-binding specificity for the different subclades and thus bring their broad functional divergence.

discussion
for plants, during the course of their evolution, gene families generally underwent either tandem and/or large-scale segmental duplication to maintain a high number of family members  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree  demonstrates that the genes from  <dig> gene clusters are sister genes, with high degrees of phylogenetic relatedness. only  <dig> genes from gene clusters i, iv, vi, viii, and xii probably emerged as a result of local duplication, as it was previously shown by the phylogenetic analysis by volokita et al.  <cit> . the phylogenetic study of plant gdsl esterases/lipases from bryophytes, gymnosperms, monocots, and eudicots suggested that duplication of more than 40% of rice gdsl genes predated the sorghum-oryza split  <cit> . if this number is combined with the number of other instances of genes’ duplication events, such as segmental or tandem duplication, the high number  of the osgelp genes potentially arose from such mode of evolutionary novelty. taken together, the data suggest that duplications in general played a major role in the multiplication of the osgelp genes, in the course of evolution. these conclusions are in line with a previous examination of the evolutionary mechanisms of the gdsl esterase/lipase gene family in land plants  <cit> . the fact that many osgelp gene clusters are interrupted by a number of te-related gene insertions implies that duplication events of the gdsl esterase/lipase protein family genes were followed by insertion of the tes throughout the course of their evolution. the large number  of the osgelp genes with tes can be also regarded as supporting evidence in favour of the theory that subsequent and important events for the expansion in size of the osgelp gene family in the rice genome after duplication could be the amplification of the repetitive elements . this observation is consistent with the previous conclusion that one of the forces for amplification of the rice genome is the addition of tes  <cit> .

several forms of gene regulation, positive and negative, that involve plant introns were found  <cit> . considering that the intron evolution in the rice genome is largely dominated by intron loss  <cit> , the large introns within the osgelp genes that were left in the course of natural selection are likely due to their possible functionality. recent studies have shown that some introns can function as alternative promoters or enhancer elements, and some introns promote mrna accumulation through diverse processes called intron-mediated enhancement  <cit> . in addition, in contrast to exon evolution, introns appear to be under a lower selection pressure; thus, they could frequently vary in size and sequence, and slowly diverge if their position in the genes that facilitate the evolution of new proteins through exon shuffling and alternative splicing increased the coding capacity of a genome  <cit> . although the osgelp genes with long introns contain repetitive elements, the majority of them  are expressed. for example, aforementioned osgelp <dig> and osgelp <dig> genes are expressed in various rice organs in three and two alternative splicing forms as supported by cdna evidence . stress conditions are one of the effectors of the alternative splicing of pre-mrnas because stress regulation might enable plants to quickly regulate the splicing and gene expression of many unrelated genes  <cit> . many alternatively spliced transcripts that were expressed under stress conditions were found among long intron genes . for instance, the osgelp <dig> gene that encodes three alternative spliced forms in the first and third forms is expressed in the shoots and calluses under the etiolation and heat treatments. these results suggest that subsequent studies should continue to investigate the advanced functions and transcriptome complexity of the osgelp gene family.

in accordance with the phylogenetic analysis,  <dig> plant gdsl esterases/lipases genes, whose functions were elucidated recently, fell into two putative groups that differ in their generic biological processes: clades i and iii. in general, according to the experimental findings  <cit> , the osgelp gene orthologs and paralogs of known functions from clade i can be potentially involved in the secondary metabolism pathways, plant development and morphogenesis, whereas the orthologs from clade iii seem to play a role in plant defence and reproduction . furthermore, to show possible function divergence of gelp genes in rice, the microarray expression data of clade i and clade iii were searched in terms of their responses to different treatment conditions by querying the genevestigator microarray database  <cit> . with the 2-fold expression difference cutoff, the expression profiles of  <dig> osgelp genes that share  <dig> to 80% similarity, to the  <dig> gdsl esterases/lipases genes of known functions are summarized in figure  <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  such factors as nutrient deficiency, chemical and hormonal treatments, biotic and abiotic stresses can modulate the expression of these  <dig> genes. the most notable expressional difference between clade i and iii seems to be in response to the cytokinins trans-zeatin , 6-benzylaminopurine , or kinetin ] treatment . cytokinins are a class of plant hormones associated with regulations of plant growth and development, chloroplast biogenesis, bud and root differentiation, shoot meristem initiation and growth, stress tolerance, and organ senescence  <cit> . expression profiles of genes from clade iii do not show significant change in their expression fold in the presence of the cytokinin. at the same time, many members of clade i show differential expression under kt, tz, bap hormones treatment , implying the possible role of the genes from clade i in plant growth and development.

to validate the results of the microarray data obtained from genevestigator database, changes in the expression level of  <dig> representative osgelp mrnas from clades i and iii, under cytokinins  treatments in rice seedling were examined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. the treatment conditions were repeated according to the description of the experiments in the genevestigator database. the expression patterns that were obtained via rt-qpcr for  <dig> and  <dig> selected genes which were treated with tz and bap, respectively, followed the same tendency and confirmed the microarray data . results of the digital expression analysis for the osgelp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and osgelp <dig> genes were not coherent with the qpcr analysis, and did not show up-regulation during the tz and kt treatments, respectively. although, most of the genes from both clades showed up-regulation of their expression, only  <dig> genes  from clade i were significantly up-regulated  after treatment with tz or bap hormones for 30 min or 3 h, respectively. at the same time, none of the genes from clade iii demonstrated significant fold change under the cytokinins treatment , therefore suggesting functional differentiation of the two examined clades. further experiments are needed to confirm the microarray validity in order to explore functional divergence of the osgelp family.

following the assumption that functional information of unknown gdsl esterases/lipases can be deduced from the orthologs of known functions  <cit> , we attempted to extrapolate the functional characteristics of described plant gdsl onto the osgelp rice genes. using the functional descriptions of the potential orthologs and homologs, based on the phylogenetic grouping, the possible putative functions for a number of the osgelp genes were predicted, and discussed further.

the rice gdsl esterase/lipase family members osgelp <dig>  and  <dig> from subclade ia share high similarity with amgdsh <dig>  that demonstrates acetylajamaline hydrolase activity and it is involved in alkaloid metabolism  <cit> . subclade ib  is expected to be involved in plant development and morphogenesis at the seedling stage according to the function of their close homologue ger <dig>   <cit> . these genes are not only expressed in many rice organs and development stages, as well as share analogous gene structure and special protein motif  <dig>  but also change their expression dramatically under stress conditions during early plant development . two genes from clade ib have received attention in recent literature. the osgelp <dig> gene is induced by both red and far-red light and by jasmonic acid, and acts in response to drought and cold stresses  <cit> . the study of osgelp <dig>  has demonstrated the role of this gene in the rice plant development at the seedling and coleoptile elongation stages  <cit> . osgelp <dig>  together with its sister genes osgelp <dig> and osgelp <dig>  arose from the segmental duplication event . their close phylogenetic relationship is confirmed by the high node number and the high protein similarity score . therefore, the functions of these genes might be similar to that of the osgelp <dig> . subclade ie, mentioned previously, is a good example of the group of genes with possibly related functions. the genes in subclade ie appear to belong to the cell wall-associated proteins with carbohydrate substrate specificity . together with the cell wall-associated gdsl esterase/lipase orthologs   <cit> , rice osgelp <dig>  and  <dig> genes form a distinctive group in clade i . the α-fucosidase  <dig>  from a. thaliana, lanatoside 15′-o-acetylesterase  from digitalis lanata ehrh. woolly, and their homologue early nodulin protein  from medicago sativa are reportedly active on oligo- or polysaccharide substrates  <cit> . lae acts as deacetylators on cardenolide glycosides   <cit> . atfxg <dig> modifies xyloglucan oligosaccharides through the hydrolysis of t-fucosyl residues  <cit> . the representatives of the acetylcholinesterase  gene family have been characterized and cloned recently in several plants, including z. mays l., macroptilium atropurpureum, and salicornia europaea l.  <cit> . although the definite physiologic role of the ache gene family has not been elucidated yet, aches are suggested to play a role in the gravity response of plants. according to the motif analysis, this group of the cell wall-associated proteins shares several special motifs in the subclade ie, such as motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . a total of  <dig> rice osgelp genes from clades i and iii putatively can be important to the plant defence response against biotic infections, as evident from their microarray expression data  and relatively high similarity to the number of defensive gdsl esterases/lipases    <cit> . as potentially appealing subjects for future analyses of the osgelp gene family, subclade iiif can be specifically studied. it not only contains five different exclusive motifs , but also some of its members show expression in all rice organs and share similar gene structure patterns within a particular subclade .

based on the protein sequence analysis, a diversity of the consensus regions outside of motifs that encoded the gdsl esterase/lipase conserved blocks i, ii, iii, and v was found. these consensus motifs are specific to different phylogenetic clades and/or subclades from conjoint tree that differed in biological functions . the gdsl esterases/lipases are active on a wide range of substrates. this multienzymatic activity can be explained by the flexible substrate-binding pocket in the active site, which facilitates the binding of different substrates  <cit> . considering that many motifs can be functionally important and play a role in enzyme specificity and biochemical activity, the long loop regions extending from the protein core in the plant gdsl esterases/lipases might be involved in the diversification of molecular multifunctionality, as this was found in bacterial species  <cit> . for example, aryl esterase from m. smegmatis and thioesterase i from e. coli share a common structural fold, but differs in the additional insertions—unstructured loop regions in the aryl esterase proteins. it was suggested that such insertions might determine the type of enzymatic mechanism, contribute to the oligomerization, and greatly restrict the shape of the enzyme active site  <cit> . many of the predicted motifs within the loop regions were found to be specific to the members of particular phylogenetic subclades that unite the gdsl enzymes with similar biological functions . based on these findings, we would like to specifically highlight l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig>  the peptide regions of these loops are specific to different subclades from clades i and iii. based on the functional prediction, these subclades represent the proteins with different molecular functions and reaction types. as shown in the 3d protein structure prediction model , loops l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig> are hypothetically oriented around the enzyme active site and function in the flexibility of the substrate-binding pocket. therefore, these loops should be studied further to determine their role in molecular functional diversification of the plant gdsl enzymes. experiments using reverse genetics would be required to establish contribution of these motifs. the close homologs or orthologs from plant species with known putative functions, which cluster together with the osgelp proteins in the same subclades, share one or more additional conserved motifs . although the functions of these specific motifs outside the gdsl esterase/lipase domain are still unknown, the presence of the conserved motifs certainly reflects the functional similarities among the osgelp proteins that share these common motifs with other plant homologue proteins of known function.

the rice gdsl esterase/lipase family is notably one of the  <dig> largest families in the rice genome, with more than  <dig> members  <cit> . in other fully sequenced plant genomes, the gdsl esterase/lipase family also consist of high number of family members  <cit> . the remarkably high number of genes in the gdsl family in different plants can be explained by differences in enzyme function and activity on a wide range of substrates, as it was shown by volokita et al.  <cit> . this claim is supported by the existing data collected by investigations of the gdsl esterases/lipases, which have already undergone functional analysis, cloned, and characterized in different plant species, and whose physiologic role, properties, and functions have been elucidated . the multifunctionality of the osgelp family in rice, as well as in other land plant species, their diverse roles in different aspects of plant growth and development can be explained by the complexity and diversity of the genes at the structural level. the large number of genes that comprise the gdsl esterase/lipase family in land plant species, with many distinct groups and subgroups arising in the course of evolution, further explains functional divergence. hypothetically, plant gdsl esterase/lipase proteins are the evolutionary product of recombination of several proteins, and contain various domains/motifs with putative functions. such an assumption provides a clue to further study the diverse functionality of this enzyme family. motif search analysis, presented here, offers further evidence for such supposition. our manuscript introduces, for the first time, a concrete rationale for further experimentation with the rice osgelp family members, and presents unique opportunities, and articulates coherent basis for functional studies. further analyses of the gene functions using rnai and overexpression are currently under way to elucidate the mechanisms further.

CONCLUSIONS
the present bioinformatics analysis accommodates new insights into the genomic and proteomic diversity of the rice gdsl esterase/lipase gene family. the phylogenetic analysis divides the osgelp gene family into the distinct groups that share similar protein motif structure. we found  <dig> additional motifs that represent the core secondary structure elements or appear specifically in different phylogenetic subclades. members within the specified subclades can have common evolutionary origins, and obtain common unambiguous motifs that probably reflect their related molecular functions. thus, our study support required basis, and should stimulate future full-fledged functional studies of these particular motifs, as understanding the structure-function relationship of the members of the osgelp gene family is necessary.

recently, only few rice osgelp genes have been studied in order to determine their function. here, we provide a rationally reasoned, well defined platform for more detailed functional, in-depth studies of the osgelp genes based on combination of the phylogenetic, motif, and protein dimensional structure analyses. the findings presented in our manuscript can be utilized for selection of candidate genes for functional validation studies. it is of broad interest to the biological research community with wide and important practical applications in biotechnology and food science. the researchers from different domains, with different goals will find our analyses crucial for the initiation of their investigations.
