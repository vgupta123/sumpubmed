BACKGROUND
the human gut is home to 10- <dig> trillion generally symbiotic bacteria that comprise the gut microbiome 
 <cit> . some species become very pathogenic and cause serious infection if they escape their normal niche because of a compromised host gut . bacteroides fragilis is one such example. as a commensal it provides many benefits to the host, including digestion of complex polysaccharides, production of volatile fatty acids, bile acid recycling and immunity development. however, outside its niche b. fragilis can be an opportunistic pathogen 
.

while b. fragilis accounts for only a small percentage of the gut bacteroides, it is the major bacteroides species isolated from human infections 
 <cit> . while the scope of the factors that account for the particular virulence of b. fragilis are not fully known, several virulence factors have been described including the ability to withstand low concentrations of oxygen 
 <cit> , release of degradative enzymes such as fibrinogenolysin 
 <cit> , enterotoxin production, evasion of complement-mediated killing and phagocytosis, induction of abscess formation, and extensive within-strain variation of surface proteins and polysaccharides  
 <cit> . the capsular polysaccharides  that can induce abscess formation 
 <cit>  have been extensively studied. intra-abdominal abscesses can result in intestinal abstraction, erosion of resident blood vessels and ultimately fistula formation. abscesses may also rupture and result in bacteremia 
 <cit> .

in many cases, treatment of b. fragilis infection is problematic owing to its high level of resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. many b. fragilis clinical isolates are resistant to aminoglycosides, β-lactams and macrolide antibiotics 
 <cit> . resistance to metronidazole, the most widely prescribed antibiotic for b. fragilis infections, is also increasing 
 <cit> . identification of essential genes  helps in defining targets for new antimicrobial agent development 
 <cit> . in addition, essential genes conserved across the species may serve as potential targets for designing broad-spectrum antibiotics. in fact, this approach was used in identifying new antimicrobial targets in burkholderia thailandensis <cit> . on the other hand, if a narrow spectrum was desired, an agent that targeted only functions specific to the pathogen could potentially be designed.

recent advancement in sequencing technologies has allowed the simultaneous study of large mutant libraries and the subsequent identification of genes necessary for bacterial survival 
 <cit>  and has resulted in the identification of essential genes in many pathogenic bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, salmonella typhimurium, helicobacter pylori, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the results of many of these studies been collated in a database of essential genes  
 <cit> .

we undertook this study to identify the essential genes of b. fragilis 638r. essential gene identification has limitations irrespective of method used  
 <cit> . one of the key factors for success in essential gene identification in bacteria is the generation of mutants. mutants can be generated either using traditional methods such as gene deletion by homologous recombination or by using a transposon delivery vector. although the traditional method may be more technically rigorous, it is very labor-intensive and therefore expensive 
 <cit>  especially in b. fragilis species that is less amenable for genetic manipulation due to its restriction/modification system 
 <cit> . on the other hand, transposon mutant generation is relatively easy but requires an efficient and unbiased transposon delivery vector. in addition, the advantage of transposon mutagenesis is that it allows the simultaneous study of the large number of mutants in a variety of conditions, thereby identifying the genes important or detrimental to growth in that particular condition. interestingly, the mariner transposon vector psam_bt, developed for use in b. thetaiotaomicron <cit>  was useful for constructing saturated transposon libraries of b. fragilis 638r, a frequently used strain in molecular studies of b. fragilis <cit> . in addition, psam_bt has been successfully used for essential gene identification in b. thetaiotaomicron and p. gingivalis <cit> . in the present investigation we generated a saturated mutant library using psam_bt and identified the genes required for the survival of b. fragilis.

RESULTS
construction of transposon mutant library and mutants’ analysis
we previously described the technique of b. fragilis 638r transposon mutant library construction used in this analysis 
 <cit> . the psambt mariner transposon that was designed for essential gene identification has 1) illumina p <dig> sequencing adapters  near inverted repeats that facilitate sequencing of mutants and 2) a two-hairpin motif downstream of the ermf cassette that prevents read-through of the transposon disrupted gene 
 <cit> . for the subsequent mutant analysis we used the procedure described in detail for the identification of the essential genes in porphyromonas gingivalis <cit> .

we independently generated two ~ <dig>  mutant libraries . after the genomic dna preparation, each of these samples was split into two technical replicates  to minimize any changes due to technical variation introduced by downstream manipulations . these samples  were used for the identification of transposon disrupted region as described 
 <cit> .

averages of  <dig> million reads were obtained for each sample in a multiplex run. after quality filtering and clipping,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  million reads per sample were mapped to the genome of b. fragilis 638r. the transposons inserted both within  and between  the genes. the number of unique insertion sites/gene between technical replicates showed good correlation; r <dig> values for technical replicates of mp1-tr1/mp1-tr <dig> and mp2-tr1/mp2-tr <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . we then averaged the number of unique insertion sites/gene of two technical replicates and compared the values of the biological replicates. the reproducibility between two biological replicates was also high; the number of unique insertion sites/gene in mp <dig> and mp <dig> gave an r <dig> value of  <dig> . figure 
1c is a representation of those genes which had 100- <dig> unique insertions/gene in two biological replicates . the results confirm that mutant generation by the transposon vector and identification of the transposon disrupted genes is reproducible and reliable. each of the biological replicates yielded mutant libraries of >  <dig>  mutants .figure  <dig>

identification of candidate essential genes
b. fragilis 638r has  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> trna genes and  <dig> rrna genes 
 <cit> . we investigated the genes that were disrupted by transposons in two independent mutant pools. genes that had transposon insertions in the last 5% of the gene  were filtered out since they may likely to generate active product and the remaining reads were mapped against the b. fragilis 638r genome 
 <cit> . analysis of the mutant pool indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> of the  <dig> trna genes and all nineteen rrna genes were disrupted by the transposon. of the  <dig> disrupted genes,  <dig> were disrupted only once in either one or both the biological replicates. closer examination of these  <dig> mutant reads indicated that transposon was integrated well within the genes. in addition, all  <dig> genes were disrupted in a mutant pool which was sequenced following re-growth of mutants on bhi medium, confirming that these genes are not essential for survival of b. fragilis 638r. there were  <dig> genes with 1- <dig> disruptions and  <dig> genes with 6- <dig> disruptions in both biological replicates. thus,  <dig> genes  can be individually disrupted without eliminating growth of b. fragilis 638r on bhi medium.

genes were considered essential if they were not disrupted by the transposon in either biological replicate. mariner transposons preferentially insert into ta sites, therefore, we disregarded genes which have either less than  <dig> ta sites or were less than  <dig> bp in length, since these genes are likely to escape random transposon disruption 
 <cit> . with these qualifications in place,  <dig>  genes were classified as essential for growth of b. fragilis 638r on bhi medium. the essential genes were distributed evenly throughout the genome . the full list of essential genes along with kegg ortholog numbers, kegg pathways, cog classification is presented in additional file

cog and kegg classification of essential genes
we classified the essential genes according to the cog . of the  <dig> essential genes,  <dig>  genes are distributed in various domains of cogs and  <dig> genes belong to kegg orthologous members . the majority of the essential genes code for proteins involved in basic cellular process such as translation, cell wall biogenesis, replication, recombination and repair, and transcription. the relative abundance of essential genes compared to total genes was highest in the cog group j  . noticeably the essential gene list is missing  genes of cog groups for essential pathways suggesting that multiple genes can substitute for each other.figure  <dig>

four of the six subunits of dna polymerase iii holoenzyme , dna elongation and topology changing genes , and a few, but not all, recombination repair genes  were essential. in the transcription pathway, the core subunit of rna polymerase , transcription terminator , antitermination protein , nitrogen utilization regulator  and several other sigma factors were essential. the translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis cog group included many essential genes encoding 30s and 50s ribosomal proteins  and all twenty aminoacyl trna synthetase genes were identified as essential genes. in addition, a few, but not all, genes involved in translation initiation , elongation  and release factors  were essential.

the  <dig> essential genes in the cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis pathway code for proteins involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, lps core region and lipid-a biosynthesis; proteins for o-antigen biosynthesis were not among the essential genes. in the signal transduction pathway, one two-component regulator was essential . the genes encoding for chaperones  such as groel, groes, grpe and ftsh  were also identified as essential for b. fragilis growth. also, many genes involved in amino acid, nucleotide, lipid and cofactor metabolism were present in the essential gene list.

conjugation associated tra genes
surprisingly, many conjugation related genes  were classified as essential genes. similar conjugation transfer related genes were also present in the essential gene list of b. thetaiotaomicron <cit>  and particular domains of certain of the tra genes were not disrupted in p. gingivalis, although the other domains were disrupted 
 <cit> . the function of these genes outside of their importance in conjugation has not been described. the results suggest that they either have some function in cell viability or are somehow not available for transposon insertion.

capsular polysaccharides  biosynthesis, rnd efflux pumps and many regulator genes are not essential genes
interestingly the genes in the eight clusters involved in cps biosynthesis, the sixteen rnd efflux pump genes and the  <dig> arac-type regulator genes are not among the essential genes of b. fragilis 638r, although a few of them have been shown to be critical in b. fragilis under specific conditions. since these gene classes are particularly redundant in b. fragilis, it is reasonable to presume that the deleted gene is complemented by homologous members. it would be tempting to speculate that the essential genes are more likely to be non-redundant with a critical function that is not complemented by homologous genes. it is of special interest that the two component transduction regulator, rprx, is essential in spite of having seventeen and thirty-six homologs respectively in the database of essential genes  for rprx and rpry, respectively. the b. fragilis rprx/rpry genes expressed from a multicopy plasmid in e. coli affect the respective levels of the ompf and ompc porins, perhaps by interfering with normal regulation of ompf 
 <cit>  and in p. gingivalis, rpry appears to regulate stress responses 
 <cit> .

essential genes of unknown function
only  <dig>  of the essential genes could be assigned to a cog functional category  and  <dig> of these genes had no specific function delineated. the remaining  <dig>  essential genes that were not assigned to cog groups coded for hypothetical proteins. thus,  <dig>  genes  of the essential genes encode hypothetical proteins, demonstrating that the functions for nearly half of the genes critical for b. fragilis survival are still unknown.

comparison of b. fragilis 638r essential genes with related strains
a whole genome comparison indicated that 88%  of protein coding genes of b. fragilis 638r are conserved in b. fragilis  <dig> and b. fragilis ych <dig>  respectively. then we compared b. fragilis 638r essential genes with b. fragilis  <dig> 
 <cit>  and b. fragilis ych <dig> 
 <cit> . four hundred ninety four  and  <dig> genes  of the  <dig> essential genes of b. fragilis 638r were conserved in b. fragilis  <dig> and b. fragilis ych <dig>  respectively . thirty-four essential genes in b. fragilis 638r  were missing from the other two b. fragilis strains, indicating that while the majority of the essential networks of b. fragilis 638r are likely conserved among the species but there are still differences between strains.figure  <dig>

genes needed in one bacterium are not necessarily essential in another species and comparing the essential genes of divergent species can provide valuable information about networks that are shared or not shared between organisms. we looked for homologs of b. fragilis essential genes in the related species b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig>  and in the periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis atcc  <dig> . the essential genes in bt and pg were previously identified using a saturated transposon mutant library 
 <cit>  and have  <dig> and  <dig> essential genes, respectively. therefore, we also determined which of the essential genes of bf638r were also essential in those two species. since bt and pg are less closely related to b. fragilis 638r, relatively fewer genes are conserved across the whole genome; sixty-nine percent  and 35%  of b. fragilis 638r genes are conserved in bt and pg respectively. interestingly, 77%  and  <dig> %  of the essential genes of b. fragilis 638r have close homologs in bt and pg, respectively  but not all of them are designated as essential in the other species. in fact, only  <dig> and  <dig> of the b. fragilis 638r essential genes are shared as essential genes by bt and pg, respectively . the majority of the conserved genes are highly enriched in certain cog groups . many b. fragilis 638r essential genes  assigned to cog groups with critical functions , recombination and repair , n-utilization regulator , thiamine biosynthesis  and many transcriptional regulators  are, in fact, not essential for b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> 

although b. fragilis and p. gingivalis live in widely different niches , more b. fragilis essential genes are present in the oral anaerobe p. gingivalis atcc  <dig> essential genes than in the gut anaerobe b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig>  the reasons for this are not clear. essential genes with known function that are shared between b. fragilis 638r and p. gingivalis but not essential for b. thetaiotaomicron include 1) thirty-four genes belongs to translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, 2) eight genes involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, and 3) chaperones . in addition, all six genes involved in lipid-a biosynthesis are essential for b. fragilis 638r and p. gingivalis atcc  <dig> , however only the latter three genes are essential in b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> even though all of the six genes are present only in a single copy in the b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> genome 
 <cit> . thus, although b. fragilis 638r and b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> are closely related species, they apparently rely on different sets of essential genes for their survival. presumably, b. thetaiotaomicron has other homologs that code for these essential functions that were not picked up in the blast analysis for essential genes. about 21%  of the b. fragilis 638r essential genes which are missing in b. thetaiotaomicron and p. gingivalis are annotated as hypothetical proteins . further study of the species and strain specific requirements of b. fragilis strains will help us to understand its abilities to adapt to specific microniches.

the relationships between groups of essential genes between the b. fragilis strains and deg is shown in a venn diagram in figure

the gc distribution of the total genes, essential genes and various groups of essential genes of b. fragilis 638r is shown in figure 
 <dig>  the gc% distribution of the essential gene set essentially matches that of the total genes, except for a few genes. interestingly, many of the genes that were not found in b. thetaiotaomicron and p. gingivalis had gc% outside the normal distribution of b. fragilis 638r, suggesting that these genes may have been horizontally transferred from a phylogenetically diverse organism. sixteen of these genes had gc% above  <dig> or below 40; thus it is possible that they recently transferred from another species and do not have close homologs in the related anaerobes .figure  <dig>

most of the genes that had no homologs in the deg  coded for a hypothetical protein. . the annotated protein sequences of these genes were also submitted to the phyre <dig> server that predicts function based on conserved fold analysis; in some cases the phyre <dig> server will predict function when the other servers do not. phyre  <dig> analysis predicted functions for  <dig> genes which were previously annotated only as hypothetical proteins: bf638r_ <dig> and bf638r_ <dig> , bf638r_ <dig>  and bf638r_ <dig>  .

transposon insertion in certain genes may not be tolerated, not because those genes themselves are essential, but because the disruptions may affect expression of downstream essential genes present within the same operon. therefore, we analyzed potential polar effects of the b. fragilis 638r essential genes. based on the operon prediction, disruptions in  <dig> of the  <dig> essential genes are likely to have a polar effect on downstream genes present in the same operon . these  <dig> genes are at the upstream end of an operon that contains one or more known essential genes as described in the deg. interestingly,  <dig> of those  <dig> genes are also present in the deg; many of those genes are conserved in essential genes of more than one strain and deserve further study.

transcription analysis of essential genes
whole genome transcription analysis by rna-seq 
 <cit>  indicated that  <dig> of  <dig>  genes are transcribed in b. fragilis 638r. transcription levels of essential genes demonstrated that most of the essential genes with assigned cog  are transcribed  . also, 187/ <dig> genes classified as hypothetical proteins are transcribed. mid-log cells were used for rnaseq analysis, thus it is possible that the other  <dig> genes which did not show transcript/expression may be transcribed at a different growth stage. this data suggests that many genes with completely unknown function are essential for the growth of b. fragilis 638r.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified the essential genes required for the survival of b. fragilis 638r in bhi medium using a transposon delivery vector and illumina sequencing technology. the results indicate that only  <dig> %  genes are essential. the b. fragilis genome is known for having redundant genes; for example, it has sixteen rnd efflux pumps, at least four genes for the major membrane protein ompa 
 <cit> , more than  <dig> arac-type regulators 
 <cit> , multiple operons for the degradation of dietary polysaccharides, and eight operons for capsular polysaccharides. in cases of gene redundancy, a disrupted gene may be complemented by another gene , and it would be expected that genes with multiple homologs might not be essential for survival of b. fragilis 638r but will result in synthetic lethality if all homologs are targeted. thus, most of the essential genes described for b. fragilis 638r are genes which do not have a complementary gene. further study is needed to determine why specific genes are essential, particularly for the  <dig> genes code for hypothetical proteins with no known function. since most of the essential genes code for proteins that are involved in fundamental biological process such as translation, cell wall biogenesis, translation and transcription, we presume that  <dig> hypothetical genes also encode for proteins in vital pathways. further characterization of these hypothetical proteins may provide novel information about unique pathways used by b. fragilis.
