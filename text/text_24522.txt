BACKGROUND
ubiquitylation  is an important mechanism of post-translational modification that ubiquitin will be linked to specific lysine residues of target proteins by forming isopeptide bonds. three enzymes including activating enzyme , conjugating enzyme , and ubiquitin ligase  are involved in the ubiquitylation process. another enzyme e <dig> can help to stabilize and extend polyubiquitin chain  <cit> . the first discovered function of ubiquitylation is to target proteins for subsequent degradation by the atp-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome system. subsequently, many regulatory functions of ubiquitylation were discovered including the regulation of dna repair and transcription, control of signal transduction, and implication of endocytosis and sorting  <cit> .

because of the important regulatory roles of ubiquitylation, numerous methods were developed to purify ubiquitylated proteins  <cit> . also, the growing number of studies of large-scale identification of ubiquitylated proteins and analysis of ubiquitin-related proteome reflect the importance of identifying ubiquitylation proteins and sites  <cit> . the three steps affinity purification, proteolytic digestion, and analysis using mass spectrometry were applied in most of these studies  <cit> . these works cost a lot of experimental efforts. therefore, this study focuses on the computational identification of ubiquitylation sites from protein sequences by developing an accurate prediction method.

using both informative features and an appropriate classifier is essential to design an effective system for prediction of ubiquitylation sites. in the past, numerous sequence-derived features have been proposed to discriminate protein or residue functions. for example, the automotif server utilized six kinds of features and support vector machine  to predict post translational modifications  <cit> . the popi server used physicochemical properties as efficient features to predict peptide immunogenicity  <cit> . in this study, three kinds of useful features which can be extracted from protein sequences are evaluated: conventional amino acid identity  <cit> , evolutionary information  <cit> , and physicochemical property  <cit> . at the same time, three machine learning classifiers, k-nearest neighbor, naïvebayes, and svm are also evaluated.

we established an ubiquitylation dataset  consisting of  <dig> ubiquitylation sites and  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites extracted from  <dig> proteins in ubiprot, a database of ubiquitylated proteins  <cit> . for predicting functions of a residue in a protein, it is well recognized that nearby residues will influence the property and structure of a central residue. the environmental information will be useful to enhance prediction accuracy that is extensively used in previous studies  <cit> . we constructed ten datasets with window sizes  <dig>   <dig> ...,  <dig> from ubidata to evaluate all combinations of the evaluated features and classifiers. according to the prediction accuracies of using 10-fold cross-validation , the physicochemical property and svm are the best kind of features and classifier, respectively.

in order to provide insights into the underlying mechanism of ubiquitylation and advance the prediction accuracy, an informative physicochemical property mining algorithm  is proposed to further select an informative subset of  <dig> physicochemical properties based on an inheritable bi-objective genetic algorithm  <cit> . this approach to identifying a problem-dependent set of informative physicochemical properties served as input features to svm is shown to be effective in predicting both protein subnuclear localization  <cit>  and immunogenicity of mhc class i binding peptides  <cit> . by applying ipma to mine informative physicochemical properties and tune svm parameters while maximizing the 10-cv accuracy, a set of  <dig> informative physicochemical properties was obtained. based on the informative physicochemical properties, a decision tree method c <dig>   <cit>  was used to acquire if-then rule-based knowledge for biologists to further understand the mechanism of ubiquitylation.

a prediction system ubipred for predicting ubiquitylation sites was implemented by utilizing the  <dig> informative physicochemical properties. ubipred performs well with a prediction accuracy of  <dig> % using leave-one-out cross-validation , compared with the svm-based methods using amino acid identity , evolutionary information  and all physicochemical properties . besides the prediction accuracy, the receiver operating characteristic  curve is commonly used to evaluate the discrimination ability of a classifier. the larger the area under the roc curve, the better discrimination ability a classifier has. the area under the roc curve of ubipred is as high as  <dig>  by using the decision value of svm as a tuning parameter. ubipred has been implemented as a web server and is available online  <cit> .

because there are still many ubiquitylation sites to be discovered  <cit> , ubipred can predict ubiquitylation sites accompanied with a prediction score  each to help biologists in selecting the most promising sites for experimental verification. by selecting the sites with scores larger than  <dig>  from an independent dataset of  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites,  <dig> promising ubiquitylation sites can be identified. the in silico validation by using the prediction rules obtained from c <dig>  provides another confirmation in identifying the  <dig> promising sites as ubiquitylation sites.

RESULTS
assessments of features and classifiers
the dataset ubidata consists of  <dig> ubiquitylation sites and  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites extracted from  <dig> proteins in ubiprot  <cit> . ten datasets with window sizes w =  <dig>   <dig> ...,  <dig> were constructed from ubidata to assess three kinds of sequence-based features and three classifiers: ibk , naïvebayes, and svm . in assessing the feature of physicochemical properties, all n =  <dig> properties available were used. five versions of the classifier ibk with k =  <dig>   <dig> ...,  <dig> were evaluated to find the best value of k for classification. for naïvebayes, both the normal distribution and the estimated distribution were applied to evaluate prediction performances.

informative physicochemical properties
most of the  <dig> physicochemical properties may be irrelevant features or even interfere with prediction of the svm classifier. therefore, it is important to mine informative physicochemical properties for advancing the prediction accuracy. ipma determines a feature set of r informative physicochemical properties and the values of svm parameters  for a given window size w. because of the non-deterministic nature of ipma, the obtained solutions would be different for each run. to obtain the features with robust performance,  <dig> independent runs of ipma were performed for each window size w.

the highest, mean, and lowest prediction accuracies of ipma using 10-cv are shown in fig.  <dig>  for comparison, the decision tree method c <dig>   <cit>  with the ability of feature selection based on information gain was also evaluated. the accuracies of c <dig>  and svm with the properties selected by c <dig>  for various window sizes are also given in fig.  <dig>  for all window sizes, the accuracies of svm using informative physicochemical properties mined by ipma are better than those of c <dig> , svm using all  <dig> physicochemical properties, and svm using the c <dig> -selected properties. considering the mean accuracies of svm with informative physicochemical properties in fig.  <dig>  the best window size is w =  <dig> 

the quantified effectiveness of individual physicochemical properties on prediction is useful to characterize the ubiquitylation mechanism by physicochemical properties. orthogonal experimental design with factor analysis  <cit>  can be used to estimate the individual effects of physicochemical properties according to the value of main effect difference   <cit> . the property with the largest value of med is the most effective in predicting ubiquitylation sites.

according to med, the  <dig> informative properties are ranked and their descriptions are shown in table  <dig>  the most effective property with med =  <dig>  is nadh <dig> denoting "hydropathy scale based on self-information values in the two-state model of 9% accessibility". the least effective properties with med =  <dig>  are nakh <dig> and qian <dig> denoting "amino acid composition of total protein" and "weights for coil at the window position of -4", respectively. the ranked informative physicochemical properties provide valuable information to biologists for further experimental verification.

knowledge of data mining
although the prediction accuracy of svm is rather high compared with the other classifiers evaluated, it is not easy for biologist to interpret the prediction rules. in order to acquire interpretable knowledge from experimental data, c <dig>  was applied to construct a compact decision tree by using the  <dig> informative physicochemical properties selected by ipma on the whole training dataset. figure  <dig> shows a constructed decision tree by c <dig> . by utilizing this decision tree to classify the whole training dataset, the accuracy is  <dig> %. this decision tree can be directly converted into a set of eight interpretable rules  <cit> , consisting of three and five if-then rules for ubiquitylation sites and non-ubiquitylation sites, respectively.

to obtain rather simple rules for easy interpretation, five concise if-then rules obtained from c <dig>  are shown in table  <dig>  the first rule with the highest confidence value  <dig>  can be interpreted as 'given a peptide with a central residue lysine , if the average reduced distance for side chain  <cit>   is less than or equal to  <dig> , then the residue is a non-ubiquitylation site with a confidence value  <dig> '. this rule covers  <dig> sites in the training dataset and no site is misclassified by this rule.

there is only one of five classification rules for identifying ubiquitylation sites with a moderate confidence value  <dig> . this rule means that if the average reduced distance for side chain is larger than  <dig> , then the residue is an ubiquitylation site with a confidence value  <dig> . this rule reveals that the ubiquitylation sites are not easily discriminated from non-ubiquitylation sites. furthermore, the property meih <dig> plays an important role in predicting ubiquitylation sites. examining the med value  of meih <dig> in table  <dig>  it is rather consistent that meih <dig> is an informative property with a rank  <dig> 

the second rule means that if the mean volume of residues buried in protein interiors  <cit>   is larger than  <dig>  and the nneig index  <cit>   is larger than  <dig> , then the residue is a non-ubiquitylation site with a confidence value  <dig> '. this rule covers  <dig> samples in the training dataset and  <dig> of them are misclassified by this rule.

the third rule indicates that if the composition of amino acids in nuclear proteins   <cit>  is larger than  <dig> , then the residue is a non-ubiquitylation site with a confidence value  <dig> '. this rule covers  <dig> samples in the training dataset and  <dig> of them are misclassified.

the fourth rule indicates that if the linker propensity from helical  dataset  <cit>  is less than or equal to  <dig> , then the residue is a non-ubiquitylation site with a confidence value  <dig> '. this rule covers  <dig> samples in the training dataset and  <dig> of them are misclassified.

prediction system ubipred
the  <dig> informative physicochemical properties  with w =  <dig>  c =  <dig>  and γ =  <dig>  were used to implement a prediction system ubipred for identifying ubiquitylation sites. the system flow of the prediction server ubipred is shown in fig.  <dig>  the input to ubipred is a protein sequence. ubipred will automatically encode the peptide with a central residue lysine of size w =  <dig> using the  <dig> informative physicochemical properties. subsequently, the lysine residues will be annotated in terms of both ubiquitylation and a prediction score.

for comparisons with ubipred, the same loocv performances of svm using the three kinds of features: all physicochemical properties, amino acid identity, and evolutionary information are also evaluated using their corresponding best parameter settings obtained from the previous learning results, shown in table  <dig> 

informative physicochemical properties , amino acid identity, evolutionary information, and all physicochemical properties.

four measurements were used for evaluation of prediction performances including sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , and matthew's correlation coefficient , defined as follows: sen = tp/, spe = tn/, acc = /, and mcc = -)/), where tp, tn, fp and fn are the numbers of true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative, respectively.

ubipred performs well with a prediction accuracy of  <dig> %, compared with the svms with physicochemical property , amino acid identity  and evolutionary information . the sen, spe and mcc performances of ubipred are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively. to compare ubipred with other methods in terms of robustness abilities, the nonparametric method of using a roc curve is utilized by using the decision value of svm as a tuning parameter. the area under the roc curve  is calculated, as shown in fig.  <dig>  ubipred with auc =  <dig>  performs well, compared with the svm-based methods using all physicochemical properties , amino acid identity  and evolutionary information .

the problem of sequence redundancy may result in overestimation of prediction performance. to address this issue, six thresholds of sequence identity  were applied to construct six additional datasets from the dataset of w =  <dig> by using cd-hit  <cit> . the numbers of positive and negative samples of datasets with various sequence identity thresholds are shown in table  <dig>  by using the strictest threshold 40%, there are only  <dig> redundant samples and the resulting dataset consists of  <dig> negative samples and  <dig> positive samples. by applying loocv to evaluate prediction accuracies on these datasets, good performance  was obtained by using svm with the mined  <dig> informative physicochemical properties and svm parameters . the results show the effectiveness of the proposed ubipred.

screening promising ubiquitylation sites
recently, a new experimental method was proposed with  <dig> -fold increase in the number of identified ubiquitylation sites, compared with previous methods  <cit> . it implies that there may be still many undiscovered ubiquitylation sites. to identify promising ubiquitylation sites from putative non-ubiquitylation sites, a scoring method is designed by normalizing the range of the decision values of svm obtained from the training dataset of w =  <dig> into the range  <cit>  of prediction scores. normally, the default threshold value  <dig> used by the svm classifier for discriminating ubiquitylation sites from non-ubiquitylation sites is mapped to a prediction score  <dig> . the site with a prediction score close to  <dig> has a high possibility to be an ubiquitylation site. if the high prediction score  <dig>  instead of  <dig>  was adopted when classifying the peptides in the training dataset for all window sizes, there would be no false positive.

the prediction system ubipred is applied to score  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites in an independent dataset that are not included in the training dataset of w =  <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  the screening result is shown in fig.  <dig> using a histogram of prediction scores. there are  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites with scores larger than  <dig> . there are  <dig> peptides with scores larger than  <dig> , which are the most promising ubiquitylation sites, listed in table  <dig>  the detailed information can be found in the website of ubipred  <cit> . the sequence logo of the  <dig> peptides shown in fig.  <dig> represents low information content similar to the sequence logo of the  <dig> positive samples in training dataset.

for further validating the  <dig> peptides as ubiquitylation sites, the five prediction rules obtained from c <dig>   were applied to the  <dig> peptides. results show that all the  <dig> promising peptides are classified as ubiquitylation sites. for example, the average value of property meih <dig> for the  <dig> peptides is  <dig>  which is larger than the threshold of  <dig> . this value is close to that  of the  <dig> positive samples in training dataset. note that the smallest and largest index values of meih <dig> for  <dig> amino acids are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the prediction system ubipred can predict ubiquitylation sites with prediction scores to identify the most promising ubiquitylation sites for experimental verification or future research.

CONCLUSIONS
ubiquitylation plays many important regulatory roles in the physiology of eukaryotic cell. nowadays, many experimental studies are working on identifying ubiquitylated proteins and their ubiquitylation sites. to efficiently identify promising ubiquitylation sites by computational prediction methods is helpful to save experimental efforts. in this study, the combinations of three kinds of features  and three classifiers  were evaluated for predicting ubiquitylation sites. the ubiquitylation dataset consists of  <dig> ubiquitylation sites and  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites extracted from  <dig> proteins in the ubiprot database. results show that the best prediction method is the combination of using an svm classifier and all physicochemical properties.

it is well recognized that irrelevant information will interfere with classifiers. this study proposes an algorithm ipma to identify a small set of informative physicochemical properties to advance the prediction performance and further understand the underlying mechanism of ubiquitylation. the derived  <dig> informative physicochemical properties improve the prediction accuracy from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and the properties were ranked in terms of their individual effectiveness of prediction. a decision tree method c <dig>  was also applied to derive the rule-based knowledge and analyze the  <dig> informative physicochemical properties. five concise rules provide a human-interpretable way to biologist for distinguishing ubiquitylation sites from non-ubiquitylation sites.

finally, the system ubipred for predicting ubiquitylation sites is designed by using the  <dig> informative physicochemical properties. the web server of ubipred has been implemented and is available online  <cit> . the prediction scores of ubipred can be utilized to identify promising ubiquitylation sites for experimental verification. in this study,  <dig> promising ubiquitylation sites whose prediction scores are larger than  <dig>  were identified from an independent dataset of  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites and were also validated by the five concise rules obtained from the training dataset.
