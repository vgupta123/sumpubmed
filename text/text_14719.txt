BACKGROUND
stomach ulcers are the common gastrointestinal and global disorders  <cit> . it occurs mainly due to the imbalance between the destructive and offensive factors of the mucosal barrier  <cit> . the destructive factors include stomach hydrochloric acid , mucosal hypoperfusion, free oxygen radicals, ethanol, helicobacter pylori and excessive ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  that promote the gastric mucosal injury and contribute to gastric ulceration  <cit> .

the prevention or treatment of gastric ulcers is a medical challenge  <cit> . gastric ulcer therapy has major disadvantages, including limited efficacy of drugs against the gastric illness and severe side effects  <cit> . therefore, medicinal plants may be a viable alternative therapy that has fewer side effects and contains a wide variety of antioxidants. medicinal plants are also promising alternative medications for the development of new drugs to control gastrointestinal diseases, which has been reviewed extensively in the literature .


cibotium barometz hair  is known traditionally as “golden hair dog fern”. cibotium is a tropical native medicinal plant in the malaysian peninsula and parts of china. it is an anti-inflammatory plant and is used in contradiction of rheumatic and menstruation problems, as well as herniated discs and hyperosteogeny  <cit> . there are many phenolic compounds in cibotium that are potent antioxidants and strong chelators. the rhizomes are comprised of approximately β-sitosterol, caffeic acid, daucosterol, alternariol, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde, -des-o-methyl lasiodiplodin, protocatechuic aldehyde, -stigmast-4-ene-3-one, onitin, 24-methylenecycloartanol, protocatechuic acid, n-butyl-β-d fructopyranoside, palmitic acid, 1-monopalmitin, d-glucose and 30% starch  <cit> . it has been confirmed that c. barometz obstructs osteoclast creation with no effects on cell viability  <cit> . the hairof cibotium is a staple ingredient in the ointments that are applied in natural treatments, such as to stop bleeding  <cit> . the objective of our study was to evaluate the stomach-protective effect of c. barometz hair ethanol extracts on ethanol-induced stomach ulcers in rats.

discussion
traditional medicine has become an important type of alternative medicine in many countries. several medicinal plants have been used to protect the stomach from a number of ulcerative agents. one type of medicinal plant is c. barometz leaves, which are used to stop bleeding  <cit> . in this study, the results of acute toxicity experiment revealed no signs of toxicity or mortality in vivo and no variations in kidney and liver on biochemical investigation. additionally, no differences in body weights were observed for both sex sd rats. these findings corroborate previous studies . our data suggest that c. barometz hair extract has high free-radicals scavengings and antioxidant activities in vitro. our results agree with a previous report that indicated that the consumption of medicinal plants that contain natural antioxidants can reduce free radicals and protect biological molecules from oxidative injury  <cit> . c. barometz hair is one of the medicinal plants that have medicinal properties and natural antioxidants  <cit> . c. barometz hair displays good free-radical scavenging activity and ferric-decreasing antioxidant power in a fe3+-dependent hydroxyl-radical generation assay  <cit> . this outcome agrees with earlier studies of c. barometz, in which it showed a greater antioxidant activity  <cit> . our data indicate that significant protection of stomach wall mucosa and decreases in ulcer area are observed in rats pre-fed with c. barometz extract. our observation is consistent with the findings of several other studies  <cit> .

we also observed a significant elevation of stomach mucus content and ph in rats pre-fed with c. barometz hair extract compared to category of the ulcer control rats. this shows the extracted plant of c. barometz is able to protect the mucosal layer of the stomach from destructive causes. these results are similar to those previously reported by others . a severe distraction of the gastric mucosa layer, edema and leucocyte penetration of submucosal layers were apparent in the ulcer control rats compared with rats pre-fed with c. barometz hair extract. the rats treated with c. barometz hair extract displayed a mild distraction of stomach epithelium and reduced edema and inflammatory cell penetration of the submucosal layers. similarly, many studies have also observed mild distraction of stomach mucosa, mild edema and penetration of inflammatory cells in the submucosal layers . additionally, the condensing of the submucosal layer was detected in the ulcerated group where there was edema and hemorrhagic abrasions in the mucosal layer, which is an indicator of ethanol damage. absolute ethanol harshly damages the stomach glandular epithelium leading to augmented neutrophils access into the disrupted stomach mucosa. the presence of oxygen free radicals resulting from the penetration of neutrophils in the wounded gastric wall can damage stomach gastric mucosa in rats  <cit> . neutrophils are the main sources of inflammatory mediators and can release the potent reactive oxygen species, which are cytotoxic and can promote tissue injury  <cit> . furthermore, neutrophils that congregate in the stomach mucosa have been exposed to irritation through the microcirculatory defect  <cit> . the present study illustrated strong staining of glycoprotein discharge of stomach glandular epithelium in rats pre-fed with c. barometz extract. mucus released from the stomach epithelium performs one of the vital mechanism of stomach mucosal barrier resistance against absolute ethanol  <cit> . mucus and bicarbonate liberation may have a considerable role in ulcer development because the mucus/bicarbonate layers guards newly produced cells from acidic and peptic damage  <cit> . the amplified production of mucus in the present work was an indicator of local mucosal defense in the stomach and can be described as the possible cytoprotective mechanism. numerous studies have suggested that the gastroprotective defense is due to increased mucosal resistance, and a decline in aggressive factors, primarily acid and pepsin .

the consequences of the present immunohistochemistry experiments indicate that rats pre-fed with c. barometz hair displayed an up-regulation of hsp <dig> proteins that contributed to the protection of stomach cells from heat shock, oxidative stress, and down-regulation of the bax proteins. earlier studies reported that there was up-regulation of hsp <dig> protein in animals fed with plant extracts  <cit> . however, the down-regulation of heat shock protein expression appeared in the ulcer control animals as a gastric injury marker. this is consistent with the results from other studies  <cit> . up-regulation of hsp <dig> protein in the stomach wall mucosa in animals pre-fed with c. barometz hair extract may stop the initiation of damage to the gastric epithelium upon exposure to absolute alcohol  <cit> . the hsp <dig> protein protected mitochondria and delayed a stress-induced apoptotic programmer  <cit> . our data suggest that bax immune-staining confirmed that rats fed with c. barometz hair extract displayed increased an expression of the bax protein. thus, these results demonstrate that c. barometz hair extract is a protective agent and prevents alcohol-induced damage to the rat stomach, which is associated with decreased expression of the bax protein. similarly, many amendments have been described by many investigators  <cit> . animals pre-fed with c. barometz hair extract displayed decreased expression of the bax protein. on the other hand, up-regulation of bax was observed in the ulcer control group. bax is a key protein that is linked to apoptosis during mitochondrial damage and plays a significant role in the disruption of stomach mucosal integrity that is observed after ethanol administration  <cit> .

the results from the present work demonstrated that rats pre-fed with c. barometz displayed an increase in the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes  and a decrease in mda levels in the stomach compared to the ulcer control rats. these findings are consistent with observations from other studies  <cit> . therefore, the elevation of sod and gpx enzymatic activities leads to increased scavenging of superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl and lipid peroxyl radicals, resulting in a reduction in tissue damage  <cit> . additionally, increases in cat enzymatic antioxidant activity rapidly converted the peroxyl radicals into biologically safe substance, such as water  <cit> . in contrast, the low levels of mda reduced lipid peroxidation and ros  which are products of oxidative gastric damage  <cit> . taken together, our observations suggest that c. barometz hair facilitates gastric mucosa protection due to its scavenging of free radicals and anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that c. barometz hair has beneficial and dose-dependent anti-ulcer effects against ethanol-induced acute stomach hemorrhagic injuries in sd rats. the gastro-protective effects of this effective medicinal plant could be associated with free radicals scavenging activities, elevated levels of ph and gastric mucus glycoprotein, increases in the cellular endogenous enzymes activity of sod, cat and gpx antioxidants, and a reduction in mda levels. additionally, these effects may be due to hsp <dig> up-regulation and bax protein down-regulation. thus, c. barometz hair is a promising gastro-protective agent that can potentially be used to treat gastric ulcers.
