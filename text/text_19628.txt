BACKGROUND
trichomonas vaginalis causes trichomonosis, the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted infection  in humans  <cit> . this sti poses a risk for adverse health consequences in both women and men. adverse pregnancy outcomes, cervical neoplasia, atypical pelvic inflammatory disease are serious adverse outcomes for women  <cit> . complications related to trichomonal infection in men are non-gonoccocal urethritis, prostatitis, epydidymitis, urethral disease, and infertility  <cit> , and recently a relationship between trichomonosis and prostate cancer has been shown  <cit> . furthermore, increased risk for hiv acquisition and seroconversion has been well documented in both women and men  <cit> .

t. vaginalis has increased ability to cytoadhere to epithelial versus fibroblast cells  <cit> , and it is now accepted that preparatory to successful host infection and pathogenesis is adhesion of t. vaginalis to vaginal epithelial cells   <cit> . five different adhesin proteins  mediate adherence to vecs, are members of multigene families, and except for one ap <dig> gene, are coordinately up-regulated by iron in medium, lactoferrin-iron, and heme-iron  <cit> . interestingly, laboratory-adapted t. vaginalis isolates synthesize lower amounts of adhesins and have lost the ability to up-regulate synthesis by iron  <cit> . fresh clinical isolate trichomonads immediately upon adherence to vecs but not hela cells display a dramatic change in morphology concomitant with synthesis and surface placement of adhesins  <cit> , and this was more recently confirmed by analysis of the numerous trichomonad genes up-regulated upon contact with vecs  <cit> . the adhesins ap <dig>  ap <dig>  ap <dig>  and ap <dig> were found to have sequence identity to metabolic enzymes  <cit> , which reside within the hydrogenosome  <cit> .

ap <dig> is the hydrogenosomal nad-dependent decarboxylating malic enzyme and is a prominent trichomonad adhesin  <cit> . this conclusion is based on several lines of evidence. first, there is a direct relationship between the amount of ap <dig> bound to vecs and levels of adherence compared to other adhesins  <cit> . second, polyamine depletion increased levels of adherence up to 20-fold, and most of this increased adherence was abrogated by anti-ap <dig> antibody  <cit> . third, the genetic approaches involving antisense decreased expression of ap <dig>  <cit>  and heterologous expression of t. vaginalis ap <dig> in t. foetus  <cit>  reaffirmed the role of ap <dig> in adherence. more recently analysis of the proteins secreted during growth of t. vaginalis parasites revealed numerous metabolic enzymes, among which included ap <dig>  it is noteworthy that ap <dig> of the secreted protein preparation was found capable of being internalized by vecs, and this resulted in signaling of vecs for expression of genes, which included il- <dig> and cox- <dig>  <cit> . episomal expression of ap <dig> within epithelial cells confirmed a role for ap <dig> within cells in up-regulating expression of genes  <cit> . therefore, as ap <dig> appears to play a role in establishment of infection and host response and given the significance of trichomonosis as a major sti, it is necessary to continue to characterize this adhesin and identify receptor-binding epitopes for possible future interference strategies.

in previous work, we have demonstrated that anti-ap <dig> serum igg antibodies inhibit adherence of live parasites. further, the mapping of the antibody-binding epitopes of ap <dig> revealed a cluster of epitopes at the amino terminus of ap <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that the receptor-binding epitope of ap <dig> was localized to the n-terminal region of the protein. in this study we confirmed that cytoadherence to vecs by t. vaginalis requires protein synthesis and surface placement of adhesins on trichomonads and showed that ap <dig> binds to trichomonads, but not trypsin-treated parasites, in an auto-ligand assay. furthermore, purified recombinant overlapping fragments of ap <dig> tested for binding activity in a ligand assay showed that a complete n-terminal domain was required for binding to both vecs and parasites. a working model is proposed to explain how this secreted trichomonad protein associates with surface membranes and functions as an adhesin.

RESULTS
binding to vecs requires protein synthesis and surface proteins
we wanted to confirm that cytoadherence to vecs by t. vaginalis requires protein synthesis and surface placement of adhesins on trichomonads  <cit> . we performed an adherence assay with cycloheximide and/or trypsin-treated parasites. as shown in this representative experiment in figure  <dig>  compared to control, untreated trichomonads , inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide for  <dig> min prior to the adherence assay resulted in a 70% decrease in binding of trichomonads to fixed vec monolayers . this result affirms previous data that showed prerequisite synthesis of adhesins for optimal attachment of organisms to host cells  <cit> . further, pretreatment of parasites with trypsin alone caused a ~90% decrease in binding , again affirming involvement of surface proteins in adherence  <cit> . treatment with both cycloheximide and trypsin further reduced parasite binding to vecs by 95% . the data for each condition was statistically significant, and as indicated by the asterisks above the bars, all were p <  <dig> . the standard deviation for each condition never exceeded 5% of the mean. these treatments did not affect parasite viability and motility. these data show that both de novo synthesis of proteins coupled with surface placement is necessary for optimal attachment to host cells by trichomonads  <cit> .

ap <dig> associates with fixed t. vaginalis organisms
fluorescence with non-permeabilized trichomonads and immunocytochemical experiments using polyclonal and monoclonal antibody  detect ap <dig> on the surface  <cit> . ap <dig> is also one of numerous proteins secreted by the parasite  <cit> . therefore, we examined the association of exogenous ap <dig> in a detergent extract to fixed t. vaginalis organisms using an auto-ligand assay similar to a ligand assay employed with vecs . as seen in figure  <dig>  immunoblots after sds-page with mab dm <dig> detected ap <dig> from parasite lysate that bound to fixed trichomonads . organisms first pretreated with trypsin to remove surface proteins followed by the auto-ligand assay had no detectable ap <dig> bound . as a control to show that the ap <dig> band in lane  <dig> was due to binding of exogenous ap <dig> with fixed parasites and not due to the release of any ap <dig> from the fixed trichomonads, an additional experiment was performed. in this case fixed trichomonads alone were boiled followed by sds-page and immunoblotting. as seen in lane  <dig>  no ap <dig> or crossreactive protein was detected, showing that the ap <dig> band seen in lane  <dig> is from bound exogenous ap <dig>  the absence of bound ap <dig> on trypsinized parasites strongly indicates a proteinaceous site on the surface to accommodate the exogenously bound ap <dig>  these data further support the idea that ap <dig> detected by fluorescence and immunocytochemical assays may in part be due to the association of secreted ap <dig> with the parasite surface.

ap <dig> recombinant fragments react with mab and polyclonal antibodies to ap65
we wanted to determine the receptor-binding epitope interacting with both trichomonads and vecs. overlapping fragments of the ap65- <dig> gene as illustrated in figure  <dig> were cloned in the pet-26b vector that contains a c-terminal his·tag® and expressed in e. coli tuner™ cells. figure  <dig>  shows a coomassie blue-stained gel of the purified ap <dig> recombinant clones , and band intensities indicate equivalent amounts of purified proteins were added to each lane. the same amounts were used for immunoblots after sds-page in part b, which shows reactivities of the five recombinant proteins detected by various antibodies. the recombinant clones had reactivity according to previously-characterized antibody epitope mapping with the mabs 12g <dig>  and f <dig> , as illustrated in figure  <dig> <cit> . polyclonal  <dig> is a newly-generated polyclonal rabbit antiserum to ap <dig>  this data indicates that recombinant proteins were expressed and represent fragments based on the ap <dig> protein. further, recombinant proteins are readily detected with antibodies essential for probing in subsequent ligand and auto-ligand assays.

recombinant subclone c <dig> binds to vecs and t. vaginalis
in order to identify the receptor-binding domain of ap <dig>  the purified ap <dig> recombinant protein fragments were used in a ligand assay with ms- <dig> vecs and t. vaginalis. figure  <dig>  shows results from a representative immunoblot after sds-page of recombinant protein that bound to ms- <dig> vecs, and as can be seen, clone c <dig> containing the complete amino terminus bound to ms- <dig> vecs . interestingly, clone c <dig> that is missing the first  <dig> amino acids as shown in figure  <dig> lost complete binding ability . these data indicate that the  <dig> amino acids of the amino-terminus are essential for a functional receptor-binding epitope for vecs. the other recombinant fragments  also did not bind to vecs in a ligand assay performed identically as with c <dig>  part b shows the relative equivalent amounts of protein for each clone used in this experiment, as evidenced by staining the gels after sds-page. this amount visualized in stained gels  represented one-tenth that added to vecs in the ligand assays. in the course of this experiment we performed an auto-ligand assay with fixed t. vaginalis organisms followed by sds-page and immunoblotting. the same amount of each clone as added to vecs was incubated with trichomonads. remarkably, as with vecs and shown in panel a <dig>  only recombinant protein fragment c <dig> bound to trichomonads. this indicates that the same recombinant fragment c <dig> of ap <dig> bound to both t. vaginalis organisms and vecs.

recombinant subclone c <dig> competes with ap <dig> binding
finally, since recombinant ap <dig> competes with the natural ap <dig> for binding to host cells  <cit> , we performed a competition experiment using clone c <dig> and ap65-ha fusion protein in a ligand assay. in this experiment, fixed ms- <dig> vecs were pre-incubated with recombinant clone c <dig> followed by addition of detergent extract derived from transfected parasites episomally expressing ap65-ha  <cit> . as seen in figure  <dig>  recombinant clone c <dig> prevented the binding of ap65-ha in a concentration-dependant manner . densitometric scanning of these same ap65-ha immunoblot bands  for comparison showed a 50% reduction of bound ap65-ha in vecs pretreated with  <dig> μg c <dig> . scans never varied more than 4% of the mean. a decrease by 50% was statistically significant . pretreatment with recombinant clone c <dig> at the same concentrations had no effect . likewise, competition was observed when fixed t. vaginalis were used  and binding of exogenous ap65-ha was fully blocked by pretreatment of fixed parasites with  <dig> μg of clone c <dig>  overall, these results indicate strongly that the binding epitope is localized to the n-terminal region of ap <dig>  and the first  <dig> amino acids of the protein are essential for ap <dig> binding to both organisms and vecs. panel a <dig> and c <dig> show the clone c <dig> bound to vecs and organisms, respectively, in these competition experiments.

discussion
binding of t. vaginalis to host cells requires synthesis and surface expression of adhesins , in accordance with earlier studies  <cit> . recent data shows contact with vecs results in the up-regulation of various trichomonad proteins, among which include the trichomonad adhesins  <cit> . the de novo synthesis of proteins might include not only the adhesins but chaperons or vesicle-associated proteins required to transport the adhesins to the surface. in fact, it has been shown that trichomonad disulfide isomerase , a protein with multiple functions and known to be a chaperon, is also up-regulated upon contact with vecs possibly helping in the compartmentalization of ap <dig> to various sites  <cit> . moreover, that ap <dig> was found to be secreted by t. vaginalis  <cit>  requires that we reassess the manner in which this protein asserts its adhesive function. we hypothesized that ap <dig> and possibly other adhesins represent surface-associated enzymes bound after secretion and that possess alternative functions as has been shown for other microbial pathogens  <cit> . it is noteworthy, however, that re-association of secreted ap <dig> for function need not exclude alternative mechanisms of surface placement of ap <dig>  for example, two transmembrane domains have been identified  <cit> , which may play a role for localizing ap <dig> onto the surface. if in fact there are multiple mechanisms at work for placing ap <dig> on the parasite surface, then this may represent an adaptation that enhances the overall functions of the adhesin-enzyme.

this data suggests the first  <dig> amino acids are essential to the binding domain of ap <dig> that is localized at the amino-terminus of the protein . deletion of the first  <dig> amino acids resulted in the complete abolishment of binding to chemically-stabilized cells using a standardized ligand assay  <cit>  of the recombinant clones . it is possible that a secondary structure formed by these amino acids is responsible for ap <dig> association. this hypothesis is supported by several observations. two synthetic peptides  comprising the first  <dig> amino acids of ap <dig> did not inhibit adherence , and bioinformatic analysis  of ap <dig> predicted two small helixes are formed by amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and by amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  as a result, the recombinant ap <dig> subclones lacking the  <dig> amino acids would be missing the first helix, and this likely would yield improper folding of the putative binding motif. in addition, the hydrophobic nature of regions of ap <dig>  <cit>  may have no role in the binding of ap <dig> to host cells and parasites  <cit> , and this is illustrated by the fact that all clones possess hydrophobic amino acids. yet, only one recombinant clone bound to cell surfaces. further, the recombinant clone c <dig> contains the 11– <dig> amino acid hydrogenosomal presequence, and our recent findings suggest based on electrophoretic mobility that the secreted ap <dig> is a preprotein with the presequence intact  <cit>  and not processed as is the enzymatic form found within hydrogenosomes. this is a significant finding because it permits us understand for the first time the difference between the hydrogenosomal and the surface-associated ap <dig> 

a specific interaction between ap <dig> and a surface structure in both organism and host cells is demonstrated by the inhibition of binding of ap65-ha fusion protein by the n-terminal recombinant c <dig> fragment  and the association of ap <dig> with untreated t. vaginalis, but not with trypsinized parasites, in the auto-ligand assay . moreover, the ap <dig> n-terminal domain binding to both vecs and t. vaginalis suggests that such a structure  has common features in both host cells and parasites. this suggests that the ap <dig> amino-terminus domain is external on the protein in order to face the surface of both organisms and host cells. indeed, models of the quaternary structure of malic enzymes show a tetrameric protein with a double dimer structure  <cit> . the monomer has the n- and c-termini close to each other and protruding outward, thereby making the amino terminal domain exposed for binding. the malic enzyme dimer that is formed by two monomers mirroring each other would provide a basis for binding between parasite and host cell, thus conferring the property of adherence to the organism. indeed, in the dimer form the n- and c-termini of each malic enzyme monomer do not interact with each other  <cit> . it is conceivable, therefore, that each ap <dig> surface dimer would have one amino-terminus exposed that interacts with the parasite and a second one interacting with the host membrane as is proposed by us in the model presented in figure  <dig>  furthermore, given the dimeric nature of ap <dig> with accessible n- termini, it stands to reason that a feature of trichomonads in suspension would be auto-agglutination. indeed, this is exactly what is seen among fresh clinical isolates, and immunofluorescence with anti-ap <dig> antibody always detects ap <dig> parasite-parasite, membrane-membrane regions  <cit> . interestingly, laboratory-adapted batch culture trichomonads unable to up-regulate expression of adhesins and that synthesize significant lower amounts of adhesins, including ap <dig>  <cit> , display little or no self-agglutination.

as mentioned above, housekeeping enzymes of pathogenic organisms are secreted and are anchorless, surface-associated proteins  <cit> . interestingly, the mechanism of secretion of some of these enzymes is unknown, and enzymes have no secretion peptide signal or lpxtg anchor motif  <cit> . t. vaginalis in fact secretes numerous metabolic enzymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-enolase, fructose-1-6-biphosphate, and the adhesin ap <dig> into the extracellular environment  <cit> . like bacterial anchorless, surface proteins, t. vaginalis secreted metabolic enzymes do not possess any known secretion peptide signal or anchor motif  <cit> . these characteristics clearly categorize trichomonad ap <dig> and possibly other secreted enzymes as members of multifunctional proteins similar to those of other microorganisms.

CONCLUSIONS
the secretion and the absence of a covalent anchor motif suggest that ap <dig> is released extracellularly and binds to the surfaces of both organisms and vecs. data suggests that the first  <dig> amino acids of the amino terminus are essential for the receptor-binding epitope. once bound to a putative receptor on parasites, ap <dig> could form at least a dimer, since hydrogenosomal decarboxylating malic enzyme-ap <dig> is a dimer and a tretramer  <cit>  possessing two amino-termini available for binding to respective parasite and host cell. this work permits us to generate a model for the association of trichomonad ap <dig> with surfaces of both trichomonad and vecs . this model is supported by previous data showing that polyclonal antibodies recognize surface ap <dig> and prevent cytoadherence  <cit> . furthermore, extracellular malic decarboxylase activity identical to ap <dig> is present  <cit> . these data collectively support the idea of a protein motif, in both vecs and t. vaginalis, binding the n-terminal region of ap <dig>  further work will confirm the structure and orientation of the ap <dig> on the surface of t. vaginalis.
