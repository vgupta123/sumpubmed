BACKGROUND
halobacterium salinarum is a halophilic archaeon utilizing light to produce atp via a retinal-based photosynthetic system. the key component of this system is a light-driven proton pump consisting of the integral membrane apoprotein bacterioopsin  with a covalently attached retinal. under conditions of low oxygen and high light, bacteriorhodopsin  is highly expressed and forms two-dimensional crystals in the cell membrane, the so-called purple membrane  <cit> . bacterioopsin is encoded by the bop gene, clustered in a locus together with other genes related to its synthesis . one of these is brp    <cit> . brp, as well as the paralog blh , are enzymes that convert beta-carotene to retinal  <cit> . another gene near bop is crtb <dig>  which encodes phytoene synthase , an essential enzyme for bacteriorhodopsin production. crtb <dig> catalyzes the synthesis of phytoene from the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, a key step in the retinal biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . also clustered with bop are several genes of unknown function, which are conserved among photosynthetic haloarchaea  <cit> . one of them is blp , encoding a protein co-regulated with the bop gene  <cit> . the other three are: bac , encoding a paralog of cdc <dig>  an aaa-atpase cell division cycle protein; bap , a small orf, following the bop gene  <cit> ; and the oe3095r gene , coding for a protein of unknown function but possessing a zinc finger like motif that could function in dna binding  <cit> .

the brp gene is transcribed together with bat, a gene encoding a transcription factor  that activates the bop operon  <cit> . the bat protein contains gaf and pas/pac domains, as well as a c-terminal dna-binding helix-turn-helix motif  <cit>  and induces the bop operon in the presence of light and at low oxygen tension  <cit> . mutations in bat were suggested to be responsible for the phenotype of constitutive br-overproduction in the s <dig> mutant strain of h. salinarum  <cit> . another protein factor regulating bop transcription is brz , a small zinc finger protein  the brz gene is located between the brp-bat and bop operons, and previous work has shown that brz is not only involved in the regulation of bop, but also of crtb <dig>  oe3107f and oe3095r  <cit> . since crtb <dig> codes for a phytoene synthase, brz appears to be a regulator of both the bop apoprotein and the retinal chromophore production. such co-regulation is possible by binding to an upstream activator sequence in the promoters of both bop and crtb <dig> operons  <cit> . dna microarray studies of brz mutants showed that the regulatory effects of brz on the bop operon are not mediated via bat. this indicates two possibilities for bop regulation: either a regulation of brz via bat or the cooperation between bat and brz at the protein level  <cit> . oe3095r, a protein containing a cpxcg-related zinc finger motif could also be involved in a hierarchical bop gene regulatory network  <cit> . long before the brz gene was identified, differences in the nucleotide sequence of this region were reported between mutant s <dig> and the wild type r <dig> strain. sequence differences were also reported downstream of brz but before bop. until now, it was not clear if these changes were relevant to the br overproducing phenotype of strain s <dig>  <cit> . besides bat, hbt. salinarum also carries two homologues of bat, annotated as boa <dig> and boa <dig>  but their functions have not yet been experimentally determined. adjacent to boa <dig>  and boa <dig>  are genes encoding small proteins that also contain cpxcg-related zinc finger motifs: oe3131f  and oe2447f .

in this study we investigated the functions of two transcription factors, brz and bat, in the context of bop gene regulation. we show that the brz mrna is bi-cistronic and the additional orf encodes a small basic protein, brb. the protein could not be detected by mass spectrometry but the translation activity of start codon of the brb gene was confirmed by bgah reporter assays. the requirement of this protein for bop transcription, and the relevance of s <dig> mutations of brz and brb to the s <dig> phenotype, was tested by site-directed mutagenesis in vivo. in addition, a cooperation of three proteins, bat, brz and brb, for light dependent activation of the bop promoter was demonstrated using a gfp reporter assay.

RESULTS
cooperation of three proteins: bat, brz and a small basic protein as partners in the regulation of bop transcription
in a previous study, brz was identified as a second regulator of bop transcription in hbt. salinarum  <cit> . this changed a simple model of bop transcription control from one using only one activator, bat, to a more complex system with two indispensible activators that probably interact with each other. the same study also showed that the regulatory effects of brz on bop are not mediated via bat  <cit> . in the current study, the activation effect of bat on bop via direct regulation of brz by bat was excluded by the phenotype of Î”bat mutants, in which transcription of brz was found not to be down-regulated . these results strongly suggest that bat and brz cooperate at the protein level. in addition, a new candidate for cooperation with brz and bat was found to be encoded by a small orf on the brz mrna. the existence of this orf was recognized after 3'-end determination of the brz transcript. for this, the mrna was circularized and the joined ends reverse-transcribed and pcr amplified according to the method described by brenneis;  <dig>  <cit> . the 3'-ends of the brz mrna were located 173- <dig> bp downstream of the brz stop codon , in some cases downstream of the tata box of the adjacent bop gene. although mrna degradation cannot be excluded as a cause of the multiple 3' ends detected by race, previous studies have shown that ragged transcription termination is common in archaea  <cit> . these results correlate well with the position of the 3'-end of the brz mrna reported previously by koide;  <dig>  <cit> , who used a different approach that averaged the signals from the mrna population. they located the 3'-end of the message at  <dig>  bp from brz stop codon. in both cases, there are sufficient nucleotides downstream of the brz stop codon to encode a small protein of  <dig>  kda  with an alkaline pi of  <dig>  . the gene was named brb  as, later in the current study, it was found to be involved in regulation of bop transcription. according to rt qpcr results, brz-brb transcript level is as low as the level of bat transcripts .

the brb translation start codon is active
to test the translation activity of the start codon of the brb gene, a mutant producing an n-terminal bgah fusion protein was constructed by insertion of a suicide plasmid into the brz-brb locus. the construct  contained the 5'-end of the brb gene fused to the bgah reporter gene , thus translation could only start from the start codon of the brb gene . enzymatic activity of the brb-bgah fusion protein was detected on agar plates containing x-gal. colonies of the mutant became blue . in a control experiment, a mutation eliminating the brb start codon  resulted in red colonies  on the plates with x-gal , proving no other potential start codons were active upstream or downstream of the tested brb start codon.

attempts to detect the gene product, brb, in various wt cell fractions using mass spectroscopy were not successful, possibly due to low levels of this protein, consistent with the low level of brz-brb transcripts by rt qpcr. the small size and high pi value may also be contributing factors limiting the number of endoproteolytic peptides available for the identification. we also tried to produce samples for analysis that were enriched in brb. for this purpose, a mutant was constructed which carries an insertion of the dna fragment encoding the cellulose binding domain  in frame and just upstream of the stop codon of the brb gene. no visible band corresponding to a brbcbd fusion protein was observed on the gels and no brbcbd fusion protein was found by mass spectrometry, again probably due to low amount of the fusion protein expressed under the native promoter.

brb can influence bop transcription
two series of mutants in the brz-brb region were produced to demonstrate the involvement of brb in regulating bop transcription. one series used a wild-type brz background, and the second used a brz inactive mutant  as the parental background. although brbcbd fusion protein was unable to be detected, the brbcbd mutant produced less bop mrna and br than wild-type cells, indicating a role for brb in bop expression . given the negative effect of the brbcbd fusion on bop gene expression, the role of brb was assessed next by translational knockouts. two knockout mutants having stop codons in the brb gene were constructed: brbstop <dig> and brbstop <dig> . the brbstop mutants were constructed instead of the brb deletion mutant to avoid any possible polar effects of the deletion on transcription of the neighboring genes. the brbstop <dig> mutant had a stop codon in the middle of the brb gene and so should produce only the first half of the brb protein. mutant brbstop <dig> contained two stop codons at the beginning of the brb gene. the bop mrna  and br levels , were found to be the same as in wild-type cells in both mutants. the lack of a phenotype could be explained either by the residual activity of a proposed protein complex that regulates bop transcription in the absence of brb protein, or by the ability of the putative complex bat/brz to recruit other proteins able to substitute brb functionally. in the first case, appropriate mutations in the brb sequence could have more deleterious effects than a knock-out of brb. to test this, mutants were constructed based on old observations of changes in brz and brb that were previously published in a study of hbt. salinarum strain s <dig>  long before these orf's were recognized to be involved in bop regulation  <cit> . the s <dig> strain is a constitutive br-overproducer, and mutations in bat were suggested to be responsible for this phenotype  <cit> . however, if there is a cooperation of bat with brz and brb, mutations in brz and brb could also contribute to the phenotype in a bat wild-type background. therefore, the naturally selected mutations in brz and brb of s <dig> were introduced separately or together into r <dig> wild-type cells, using the pop-in/pop-out gene replacement method. the brz mutations s <dig> converted val to ala, and ala to thr located in a region of high homology with brz from the archaeon halorhabdus utahensis . the brb gene mutations s <dig> resulted in a frame shift and translation of a protein with the n-terminal half of the native brb followed by a new c-terminal sequence .

for br measurement cell samples were taken at the same time as for northern blot analysis. br concentration values are given in Î¼m.

cell samples were taken at the same time for northern blot analysis and br measurement.

in the initial round, two single mutants, brzs <dig> and brbs <dig> as well as a double mutant brzs9brbs <dig> were produced . northern blot analysis showed the mutated brb gene  had no effect on bop transcription if the brz gene was from wild-type . in contrast, cells with the wild-type brb gene but mutations in the brz gene  showed down-regulated levels of bop mrna and br expression . the effect was more prominent at the stationary  stage of growth and did not depend on the presence of light. surprisingly, the double mutant carrying both changes, brzs9brbs <dig>  showed bop mrna level elevated up to that of wild-type and br expression up to half of the wild-type level at the stationary stage of growth . apparently, the brb protein can be omitted genetically at the level of the wild-type brz either completely or with sequences like that of the brbs <dig> mutation. however, at the level of the brzs <dig> mutant knocking out br regulation, the brbs <dig> protein can rescue the s <dig> mutation of brz to restore bop mrna levels up to that of wt. since the naturally selected c-terminal sequence of brb in the brbs <dig> strain shows this compensatory effect, a further two control mutants were produced, brbm <dig> and brzs9brbm <dig>  with frame shifts changing only the sequence of the c-terminal part of the brb protein beyond amino acid  <dig> in an arbitrary manner . the single mutant, brbm <dig>  possessed the wild-type brz, and the double mutant, brzs9brbm <dig>  carried the s <dig> mutation in brz . the phenotypes of both mutants confirmed the dominant role of brz and specificity of s <dig> mutations in brb, as the m <dig> c-terminal sequence in contrast to the s <dig> c-terminal sequence in s <dig> restored the wt phenotype only to a small extent .

for br measurement cell samples were taken at the same time as for northern blot analysis. br concentration values are given in Î¼m.

taken together, these results suggest that brb participates in the regulation of bop transcription and, further, that brz and brb proteins depend on each other for the activation of bop transcription.

cooperation of bat, brz and brb in the activation of the bop promoter
while bat and brz are crucial regulators of bop transcription, the results described above indicate that brb is also at least marginally involved in this process. to further test a possible cooperation between the brz, brb and bat proteins, a gfp reporter assay was established. reporter plasmids contained the gfp gene and different sets of the brz, brb, bat genes in a single operon under the bop promoter control . at the 3'-end a terminator sequence from the a flagellin operon was added. the reporter plasmids included replication origins of hbt. salinarum and e. coli, and resistance markers for novobiocin and ampicillin. a control plasmid was identical except for using the oe3095r gene  instead of brz, brb or bat, since its deletion did not effect bop transcription . expression of gfp in these constructs is controlled by the bop promoter, allowing the effects of brz, brb and bat on bop promoter activity to be directly assessed.

the wild-type cells r <dig> were transformed by the reporter plasmids and transformants were selected on plates containing novobiocin. prior to measuring gfp activity, the transformants, grown in medium with novobiocin, were washed and then resuspended in novobiocin-free medium. this was to avoid the negative effects of novobiocin on bop promoter activity  <cit> . for each transformant, cells were grown under light or dark conditions, and the fluorescence measured and compared. plasmid copy number should not depend on the presence and absence of light, so the results for the same transformant should be directly comparable. since light is an inducer of bop transcription, gfp fluorescence would only be expected to be increased in light versus dark conditions by the correct combination of brz, brb, bat proteins expressed from the reporter plasmid. as shown in figure  <dig>  the enhancement of gfp fluorescence by growth of cells under light was only observed when all three genes: brz, brb and bat were present in the reporter plasmid. this indicates their cooperation for light mediated activation of the bop promoter. while the absolute values of gfp fluorescence varied between transformants carrying the same plasmid construct, as well as between transformants carrying plasmids with different constructs of brz, brb and bat, these variations do not effect the interpretation of light versus dark behavior of individual transformants, and were probably due to differences in plasmid copy number. this data clearly identifies a requirement for all three genes, brz, brb and bat, in bop induction.

homologues and analogues of brz and brb in hbt. salinarum and other halophilic archaea
orfs oe2447f and oe3131f encode hypothetical proteins that carry zinc finger motifs like brz, and might also be involved in the bop gene regulation. for this reason, searches near these orfs were conducted to check if they also possessed brb-like orfs encoding proteins potentially able to substitute for the brb protein. the 5' and 3' utrs of many genes in hbt. salinarum have been determined by koide;  <dig>  <cit>  and this data indicated that transcripts of both oe2447f and oe3131f were unusually long. the transcription start site  of oe2447f  lies  <dig>  bp upstream of its start codon, while the transcription termination site  is located  <dig>  bp downstream from the stop codon. the  <dig>  bp region, upstream of oe2447f contains a small orf in the same orientation as oe2447f , and can code for a small, basic protein  . we designated this protein as basic protein  <dig> . since the tts of oe2447f is located  <dig>  bp downstream from its stop codon, bp <dig> and oe2447f are co-transcribed with the boa <dig> gene. additionally, a tss for boa <dig>   <dig> bp upstream of the boa <dig> start codon, also supports co-transcription. for oe3131f , the analysis of tss  and tts  revealed that, in the region  <dig>  bp downstream of the orf, another small orf is present that overlaps with the 3'-end of oe3131f  and is predicted to code for a basic protein . this was designated as basic protein  <dig>  . thus, besides the brz/brb pair, hbt. salinarum has the potential to express two similar pairs of small zinc finger and basic proteins, which, together with the boa <dig> and boa <dig> proteins, could form complexes active in transcriptional regulation.

to test whether bp <dig> and bp <dig> are functional analogues of brb, and also influence bop transcription, mutants with stop codons aborting translation of the bp <dig> and bp <dig> genes, bp2stop and bp4stop, were constructed from wild-type cells. the introduced stop codons did not effect br expression . to test a possible substitution of brb by these proteins, the brbstop <dig> mutant was used as the parental strain to construct a double mutant having stop codons aborting translation of the bp <dig> or bp <dig> genes. repeated attempts to make such double mutants were not successful even though the same pop-in/pop-out method was used that had readily been able to generate the previous bp <dig> or bp <dig> stop codon mutations. the results indicate that bp <dig> and bp <dig> are not essential by themselves, but may become significant in a brb knockout background.

in haloquadratum walsbyi, orfs encoding a small zinc finger  and a small basic protein  were also found upstream of the bat gene. the gene encoding the basic protein overlaps with the bat gene, so they are likely to be co-transcribed. the hq1083b gene may be transcribed separately or together with bp and bat genes . the only close homologue of hbt. salinarum brz, is that carried by hrb. utahensis. in this archaeon, the brz gene appears to be transcribed as a monocistronic mrna, but an orf encoding a small basic protein can be annotated between the bat and crty genes . this orf could either be part of an operon starting from the brp and ending just before crty, or transcribed together with the crty gene.

novobiocin induces bop transcription in hbt. salinarum r <dig> strain
an inhibitory effect of novobiocin on bop transcription was reported for the nrc- <dig> strain of hbt. salinarum  <cit> , but its influence in r <dig> strain is not known. although experimental care was taken not to allow novobiocin to interfere with transcriptional experiments reported here, we were interested to see the genome wide influences of novobiocin on transcription. therefore, a dna microarray analysis of the transcripts from r <dig>  was performed, comparing cells grown in the presence or absence of novobiocin . surprisingly, bop transcription in the r <dig>  strain was not inhibited, but was 5-fold increased by the presence of  <dig>  Î¼g/ml novobiocin. this represents a clear difference to the behavior of the nrc- <dig> strain, even though r <dig> and nrc- <dig> are extremely similar in sequence  <cit> . it most likely reflects a strain-specific mutation in the b subunit of gyrase in r <dig> cells , as novobiocin binds to and directly affects the gyrase. attempts to generate an asn-544-lys mutant in r <dig> cells failed, possibly because of the important role of the b subunit of gyrase in recombination events during the pop-in/pop-out procedure.

besides the novobiocin-induced changes in bop transcription, the expression of many other genes were affected, including stimulation of gyrase and type i topoisomerases. these results are similar to the effects described previously in e. coli, where topoisomerases are known to be regulated by dna supercoiling in a negative feedback loop  <cit> . it has been reported also, that the expression of several heat-shock genes depends on the level of dna supercoiling  <cit> , and we detected as well an up-regulation of heat-shock gene hsp <dig>  finally, novobiocin exerted an up-regulating effect on genes of the basal transcription apparatus, while some genes encoding ribosomal proteins and many metabolic enzymes were down-regulated .

discussion
the current study has shown that besides bat and brz there is a third protein, brb , involved in regulating bop transcription. the brb gene is co-transcribed with the brz gene, and is predicted to specify a small basic protein. insertional mutagenesis of brb was shown to impair transcription of the bop gene and to lower br expression. in addition, mutations in brb could complement the effects of brz mutations, indicating cooperation of the brz and brb proteins. at the same time, blocking expression of the brb gene by introducing stop codons did not effect bop transcription. this would be consistent with an interaction model where bat and brz can still form a functional complex without brb, but a mutated brb negatively effects function. the latter types of mutants are classified as dominant negative, and commonly reflect alterations in multisubunit complexes. for this type of mutation, null mutations of functionally redundant genes do not alter the phenotype  <cit> . redundant genes of brb are likely to exist in hbt. salinarum, as two other small basic proteins  are predicted to be encoded by genes found in vicinity of the boa <dig> and boa <dig> genes, which code for bat homologues. these genes  were not previously annotated, but they are co-transcribed together with genes encoding small zinc-finger proteins according to published data on the transcription of these genes  <cit> . blocking of bp <dig> or bp <dig> expression did not affect the level of br expression, but surprisingly, the same pop-in/pop-out approach used for construction of the single mutants failed to produce a double mutant with stop codons inserted in both brb and bp <dig> or brb and bp <dig> genes. this may indicate such double-mutants have a negative effect on cell growth. thus, the importance of these proteins as substitutes of brb in bop transcription remains an open question.

using a gfp reporter assay, we found that light induction of the bop promoter takes place only when all three regulating factors are expressed, bat, brz and brb. this indicates that brb can be a co-activator of bop promoter in light  when, additionally, oxygen is naturally and gradually depleted during cell growth. expression of only brz and bat in the same conditions did not have a similar activation effect. thus, the combination of these three proteins can be considered as an optimal set of factors to reach maximum activation of bop transcription in light conditions. similar genes are also found in hqr. walsbyi, indicating this regulatory network is not limited to hbt. salinarum but is distributed among other haloarchaea. it cannot be excluded that this set of proteins  might activate transcription not only of bop, but also of other genes encoding opsin proteins in haloarchaea. in hbt. salinarum, such genes can potentially be activated not only by bat, brz and brb, but also by a complex comprising zinc-finger protein oe2447f , basic protein bp <dig>  and bat as a flavin-containing protein. the bat homologs boa <dig> and boa <dig> cannot have the same functionality as bat since, in contrast to bat, they do not possess a pas domain containing a flavine binding site.

a marked complexity of bop expression at the transcription level has become more apparent from mutational studies of brz and brb. while only mutations in bat were previously suggested to be responsible for the bop-overexpression phenotype of the s <dig> strain  <cit> , our results demonstrate that mutations in both brz and brb can also contribute to this phenotype. such multiple influences on bop transcription are possible if all three proteins form an interacting complex, and where changes in the ternary structure directly affect its ability to influence bop transcription. in addition, comparison of bop mrna and br levels in mutants and wild-type cells points to a tight regulation of both bop transcription and translation. br levels were significantly lower at the early growth phase , but bop mrna levels were relatively constant, and only slightly higher at a later phase of growth . this indicates a delay in br biosynthesis despite the presence of bop transcripts. the complex regulatory network controlling br synthesis probably reflects the huge energy investment required to switch to photosynthetic growth and so provides the cell with the ability to react when conditions are most favorable to do so.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our results, the activity of bop transcription is not only regulated by two major protein factors brz and bat, but is also tuned by an additional factor, a small basic protein, brb. while brb was not found to be as important as brz and bat, a cooperation of brb with brz and bat was demonstrated to provide higher induction of bop transcription in response to light.
