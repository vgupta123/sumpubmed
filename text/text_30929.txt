BACKGROUND
gene expression variation has been shown to be important for the etiologies of common disorders including cancers  <cit> , neuropsychiatric diseases  <cit> , and various autoimmune disorders  <cit> . thus, the identification of genetic polymorphisms, in the form of expression quantitative trait loci   <cit> , that have a functional impact on the regulation of gene expression provides a powerful means to characterize the molecular events responsible for disease pathogenesis and to inform potential therapeutic applications.

micrornas , a class of conserved non-coding rna molecules produced by a multi-step biogenesis pathway, have been shown to be a fundamental mechanism of gene expression regulation, targeting the 3′ untranslated region  of specific target messenger rnas  for endonucleolytic cleavage or translational repression. in contrast to mrnas, mirnas are processed into duplexes by nuclear and cytosolic rnase iii enzymes  in a maturation process. first identified in caenorhabditis elegans <cit> , mirnas have been implicated in key aspects of cellular, developmental, and pathophysiological processes. studies have illuminated the roles of mirnas in diverse biological phenomena, including cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> , developmental timing of stage-specific cell lineages  <cit> , the patterning of tissues in the developing embryo  <cit> , and the regulation of immune response to pathogens  <cit> .

the functional characterization of mirnas is currently an active area of investigation. in this study, we sought to contribute to the functional understanding of mirnas by performing genome-wide expression profiling in human liver. the liver is the primary organ in xenobiotic disposition, through a complex system involving a variety of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes. thus, patterns of gene expression in liver are likely to influence the systemic availability of xenobiotics, mediating downstream pharmacologic effects. furthermore, studies of the liver transcriptome are likely to reveal important insights into liver physiology and disease processes. recent studies have shown that mirnas are abundant in the liver and regulate a broad spectrum of liver functions  <cit> . these biomolecules may serve as diagnostic markers for such liver diseases as hepatocellular cancer  <cit>  and polycystic liver diseases  <cit> , or as promising therapeutic targets   <cit> .

thus, we conducted a genome-wide integrative study of mirnas in human liver with the purpose of clarifying their functional impact on the transcriptome and on complex human traits. we identified a comprehensive list of mirnas abundantly expressed in liver. we sought to dissect the genetic basis of mirna expression variation in a tissue of direct relevance to many human diseases and pharmacologic phenotypes. we applied quantitative trait loci  mapping to characterize genetic regulation of mirna expression levels as quantitative traits. given the relevance of the tissue for drug metabolism, we identified mirnas significantly correlated with the expression of the so-called very important pharmacogenes  as maintained by pharmgkb  <cit> , comprising a list of genes of particular importance for drug response. finally, this study provides biologic insights into certain findings from genome-wide association studies by establishing potential mechanistic links into replicated associations with a broad spectrum of complex traits.

RESULTS
mirna expression profiling
genome-wide expression profiling  identified  <dig> expressed mirnas in liver, defined here as having non-missing expression values for at least 75% of the samples. of these,  <dig> mirnas had zero missing values. a missing value for a given sample may result when the calling of the particular mirna failed. this “failure” meant that  <dig> or more of the  <dig> replicated measures of the mirna were flagged  <dig> or  <dig> by the  image software, indicating that the quantified signal was below background. alternatively, a missing value may result when the hy <dig> and hy <dig> signals were lower than  <dig>  times that of the median signal intensity of the given slide.

the  <dig> mirnas with no missing values include some of the most abundantly expressed mirnas in liver, including mir- <dig>  a liver-specific mirna previously known to be expressed in liver tissue, human primary hepatocytes, and in cultured liver cells  <cit> . included in these  <dig> mirnas too are other mirnas known to be abundantly expressed in adult liver tissue, including mir- <dig>  mir-27b, mir-30d, mir- <dig>  as well as the let- <dig> family of mirnas  <cit> . additional file 1: figure s <dig> is a heatmap illustrating a two-way hierarchical clustering  <cit>  of mirnas and samples.

mirna expression levels negatively correlated with putative target mrnas
global baseline gene expression in liver on these samples was previously quantified using the agilent 4x <dig> array  <cit>  . figure  <dig> illustrates the distribution of p-values for the negative associations between mirna expression and mrna expression.  the enrichment of low p-values among the mirna-mrna relationships suggests that our study is capturing some true signals and, of these, mirnas tend to be associated with multiple mrnas . for multiple testing for the mirna-mrna  correlations, we used a false discovery rate  approach  <cit> ; we defined fdr <  <dig>  as significant.

at this stringent threshold, we found  <dig> mirnas  to be negatively correlated with mrna expression ; comparisons were made against  <dig>  transcripts in this analysis. in particular, mir- <dig>  is associated with  <dig> target mrnas . additional file 3: table s <dig> lists the most significant of the mirna-mrna relationships and their overlap with computational mirna target prediction approaches, mirbase  <cit>  and exprtarget  <cit> .

furthermore, we conducted functional enrichment analyses, using david  <cit> , on the genes that showed the most significant negative correlations with mirnas in liver  and found a highly significant excess  for genes  involved in cell adhesion, characterized as the attachment of a cell, either to another cell or to an underlying substrate such as the extracellular matrix, via cell adhesion molecules  <cit> .

the genetic basis of mirna expression in liver
we hypothesized that mirna expression variation may in part be due to effects of genetic polymorphisms. we therefore conducted genome-wide association studies to map mirna expression levels to genomic loci as mir-eqtls. first we used the increased density of interrogated snps from conducting imputation with bimbam  <cit>  as previously described  <cit> . using mean imputed genotypes for nearly  <dig> million snps and mirna expression levels for the identified expressed genes in liver, we performed qtl mapping on each mirna. given our sample size, we considered only those snps that meet the minor allele frequency threshold of 15% in our qtl mapping. we used a strict bonferroni threshold  to define a significant “trans” association. despite this stringent threshold, we nevertheless found a genome-wide significant set of mir-eqtls, including rs <dig> for mir- <dig> , rs <dig> for mir-200c , and rs <dig> and mir-10b . at a suggestive threshold , we found  <dig> mirnas  to be associated with snp genotypes  , including rs <dig> and rs <dig> for the abundantly expressed and liver-specific mir- <dig> . figure  <dig> provides, as an illustrative example, a regional view  <cit>  of a genome-wide scan for mir-eqtls for mir-200c, a molecule that has been reported to successfully distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from liver metastases  <cit> .

several patterns emerge from this analysis. first, we identified some snps associated with multiple target mirnas. for example, rs <dig> was found to be significantly associated with mir- <dig>  mir-509-3-5p and mir-519e* . second, we identified mirnas associated with multiple snps , the last two of which are not in linkage disequilibrium.

mir-eqtls are enriched for mrna eqtls
we sought to further functionally characterize the mir-eqtls obtained from our genome-wide mapping analysis. our group had previously conducted whole-genome gene expression profiling in a larger set  of these liver samples, which allowed us to determine to what extent the identified mir-eqtls influence global gene expression as mrna eqtls  <cit> . in this previously reported eqtl study,  <dig>  genes were found to have significant cis-linked genetic effects on expression levels, a large proportion of which were replicated in two other independent collections of human liver; furthermore,  <dig> gene expression traits were found to have significant trans eqtls. we devised a simulation procedure to test for enrichment of mrna eqtls among mir-eqtls. we asked whether snps associated with mirna expression  are enriched for snps associated with mrna expression . using  <dig> randomly generated sets of snps  as controls, we generated the empirical null distribution for the overlap count with the mrna-associated snps. we observed that the mirna-associated snps are more likely to be mrna-associated  than a random set of allele frequency matched snps.

mir- eqtls and replicated associations from genome-wide association studies of disease susceptibility and quantitative traits
we hypothesized that the results of our mir-eqtl mapping might help to clarify many of the associations found in the nhgri catalog of published genome-wide association analyses, most of which have been validated in a subsequent replication study. for the definition of mirna-associated snps, we chose the liberal threshold p < 10- <dig>  because we were interested in functionally annotating snps with information on mirna expression and, furthermore, the snps had prior information on association with complex human phenotype. additional file 5: table s <dig> lists the overlap between mirna eqtls and gwas snps; for every trait-associated snp, it shows the target mirnas, the p-value for the snp-mirna association, and the direction of effect. we found mirna-associated snps for a broad spectrum of complex traits, including serum uric acid, qt-interval, pulmonary function, cognitive performance, weight and height, as well as a list of complex diseases such as alzheimer’s disease, crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, myocardial infarction, and multiple sclerosis. we found no excess of a particular direction of effect  for these trait- and mirna- associated snps; that is, there is no tendency for the “risk allele” to be associated with lower or higher mirna expression. of note however, among these snps, we found several which were associated with the expression levels of multiple mirnas , which were thus annotated to the same complex trait. this latter observation raised the hypothesis that trait- and mirna- associated snps may indeed be more likely to regulate the expression levels of multiple mirnas than allele frequency matched snps. simulation analyses using  <dig> randomly generated sets of snps  in fact confirmed this to be the case .

we asked whether the trait-associated snps in the nhgri catalog are enriched for mirna associations in liver. figure  <dig> is a qq plot that shows a significant excess of mirna regulatory signals among the nhgri catalog snps. the blue dots depict the distribution of mirna association p-values for the trait-associated snps from the nhgri catalog. the qq plot includes all  association p-values between trait-associated snps and mirna expression . furthermore, the departure from expectation is observed for only the most significant snp-mirna pairs.

vip genes and mirna regulation
given the aforementioned crucial role of liver in xenobiotic metabolism, we hypothesized that identifying genetic variations influencing mirna expression, which in turn regulates the expression of the specific target mrna of the corresponding vip gene, should highlight polymorphisms  with potential functional impact, at the pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic level, on drug response. pursuing this hypothesis, we first conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the association between mirna expression and mrna expression for each of the vip genes. we conducted random sampling  of the same size as that of the vip genes and found, on the basis of comparisons of the median p-value, that no p-value distribution  of any random set matches or exceeds that of the vip genes . figure  <dig> shows a qq plot from the association p-values between mirna expression and transcript  level, for which increased  mirna expression was associated with decreased  mrna expression. we compared the distribution of the best association p-value per gene for the vip genes  to that of random sets of the most significant p-value per gene for the randomly selected genes . again, in the “observed” and “expected” data, only the negative correlations between the mirnas and mrnas were used. taken together, these results demonstrate that the vip genes show substantial regulatory mirna effect, indeed greater than expected by chance.

we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> vip genes were significantly  associated  with mirna expression in liver. several mirnas  were negatively associated  with multiple vip genes . additional file 6: table s <dig> shows the full list of these significant mirna-vip genes relationships. notably, several of the relationships we identified  were predicted by mirbase  <cit>  as well as exprtarget  <cit> .

we investigated the mirna effect  on the vip genes relative to the global distribution of effect sizes for the negative associations  between mirnas and mrnas . this distribution showed a mean of μ = − <dig>  and standard deviation of ơ =  <dig> . we then considered those vip genes with β < − <dig> to identify pharmacogenes showing substantial mirna regulatory effect from the most significant of the mirna-mrna relationships . we identified  <dig>  such vip genes: ptgis, kcnh <dig>  gstp <dig>  adrb <dig>  nqo <dig>  adrb <dig>  f <dig>  abcb <dig>  mthfr, brca <dig>  slco1b <dig>  and dpyd. this represents a significantly higher proportion relative to what is expected genome-wide , demonstrating that these pharmacogenes are enriched for large mirna regulatory effects.

clinical associations in pharmacogenetics and mir- eqtls
since the liver is the most important site of drug metabolism and excretion, we asked to what extent the identified mir-eqtls may be used to clarify the mechanistic role of published genetic associations in a broad spectrum of pharmacologic traits. we thus compiled a list of such pharmacogenetic associations from pharmgkb   <cit>  and from our own curation  <cit> . these clinical annotations are classified according to the strength of evidence for the association  <cit> . level  <dig> requires replication in populations of at least  <dig>  cases and  <dig>  controls of the same ethnicity and corrected p-value <  <dig> . among these level- <dig> variants are the established associations rs <dig>  for clopidogrel, rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  for warfarin, and rs <dig>  for cyclosporine. level  <dig> annotations require corrected p-value <  <dig>  and at least one population of at least  <dig> although the variant may or may not be replicated. among these are rs <dig>  for lithium , rs <dig>  for atenolol , and rs <dig>  for ritonavir . level  <dig> falls short of level  <dig> criteria due to sample size or p-value, or because the evidence is based on in vitro/pharmacokinetic  support only. consistent with this evidence-based annotation, we incorporated published results from genome-wide association studies of a wide array of chemotherapeutic agents, as cataloged in a public resource pacdb  <cit>  we created. in total,  <dig> snps from all three levels were included.

we found that these clinical associations are enriched  for mirna-associated snps  relative to frequency-matched snps. for example, snps that show evidence for regulating the expression of mirnas in liver include several replicated clinical associations with response to chemotherapeutic agents, including rs <dig>   <cit>  and rs <dig>   <cit> . we hypothesized that the mirnas associated with these pharmacogenetic variants have significantly higher regulatory effect on their target genes. additional file 8: figure s <dig> compares the distribution of effect sizes on target mrnas for the mirnas associated  with the pharmacogenetic variants and the remaining expressed mirnas, indicating the larger effect sizes  of the former . the larger effect sizes  on the target genes for the mirnas associated with these pharmacogenetic associations become more significant  when we restrict only to those variants  with the highest level of evidence .

experimental confirmation of gene expression, mirna-mrna correlation and mir-eqtls
we chose two mirnas , two mrnas , and two mir-eqtls  for additional experimental confirmation. in the aforementioned analysis, mir-148a and mir-185a were significantly inversely correlated with ptgis  and adrb <dig> , respectively, while rs <dig> and rs <dig> were significantly associated with mir-148a  and mir-185a , respectively. the two mirnas and two mrnas were quantified using quantitative pcr  in the samples for which rna was still available . we found that the correlations between the q-pcr and microarray data in gene expression were generally high  . in these  <dig> samples, both the correlation coefficient and the direction of the correlation between the mirnas and the mrnas were quite similar . in confirming the two mir-eqtls, there was only a limited number of samples in the heterozygote genotype class  and the rare-allele homozygote genotype class  at the rs <dig> locus. however, we did observe similar correlations between the genotype at rs <dig> and the expression of mir-185a when comparing the q-pcr and the microarray data .

the correlation coefficient  and statistical significance  of the comparisons between q-pcr data and the original microarray data are shown. analyses were based on the samples for which rna was available .

discussion
in this study, we performed large-scale integration of genomic information, transcriptome data, and mirnaome profiling in human liver. the resulting integrative map offers the possibility of identifying key regulatory pathways involved in disease biology and therapeutic outcome. genome annotation of global mrna and mirna expression in this tissue should facilitate explorations of the complex interrelationships between genetic variation, the regulome consisting of the regulatory nodes and networks underlying biological function, and complex traits . the resource we have created expands on earlier studies of the heritability of mirna expression in  lymphocytes  <cit>  and of the utility of eqtl mapping in a variety of tissues for the identification of disease-associated genes  <cit> .

this study presents a genome-wide analysis of mirna expression in human liver, with a primary focus on understanding mirna regulatory effects on the transcriptome, but also a special emphasis on obtaining pharmacogenomic insights from an exploration of gene regulation in the tissue of key importance for drug metabolism and excretion. consistent with studies that show that mirnas target a third of the genome  <cit> , we found that  <dig> mirnas are inversely correlated  with the expression levels of  <dig>  genes. this finding implies that mrna expression in liver is likely to be altered by multiple mirnas. in particular, we identified several mirnas that significantly downregulate  the so-called vip genes, which are key pharmacogenes involved in modulating response to one or more drugs; these mirnas are thus likely to have a significant pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic influence on drug response phenotypes. for example, mir-23b, which has been implicated in liver stem cell differentiation  <cit> , significantly downregulates the expression of multiple vip genes , including f <dig>  adrb <dig>  gstp <dig>  kcnh <dig>  kcnj <dig>  nqo <dig>  and ptgis. in addition, we have shown that these important pharmacogenes are significantly enriched for large mirna regulatory effects in liver, compared to genome-wide expectation.

we found, in a gene set enrichment analysis, that the genes with the most significant negative correlations with mirnas in liver were enriched for cell adhesion molecules. regulation of cell adhesion molecules has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of many human diseases  <cit>  as well as in normal cellular and organismal homeostasis  <cit> . a growing body of literature  has demonstrated the crucial role of mirnas in four major adhesion processes: cytoskeletal dynamics, cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, and extracellular matrix; interestingly, as robert weinberg et al. <cit>  noted, those mirnas that target genes belonging to more than one of these adhesion processes are notably the same mirnas that have been implicated in various human diseases  <cit> .

our study demonstrates that mirna expression in human liver has a significant genetic component. most investigations of the effect of genetic variation on mirnas have so far been focused on genetic influence  on mirna target site recognition. our study sought evidence for the role of genetic variation in modulating mirna expression variation.

importantly, our findings can be integrated into studies of complex phenotypes from genome-wide association studies and sequencing efforts. we investigated published associations between genetic variation and disease susceptibility or quantitative traits from the nhgri repository. for example, we identified two snps, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  that have been found to be associated with ulcerative colitis  <cit>  and that predict the expression of hsa-mir-629*; remarkably, hsa-mir- <dig> has been independently found to be differentially expressed in ulcerative colitis  <cit> . two independent snps, rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  are reported associations with multiple sclerosis  <cit>  and associated with the expression of hsa-mir-126* and hsa-mir- <dig> respectively in our dataset. a snp rs <dig> has been associated with serum uric acid  <cit>  and is associated with the expression of mirna hsa-mir- <dig>  which has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the prevention of progressive kidney disease  <cit> .

in a similar vein, we systematically investigated published clinical pharmacogenetic associations for their role in regulating mirna expression. a snp rs <dig> was found to be associated with end-of-induction minimal residual disease in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia from  <dig> independent cohorts and higher methotrexate clearance  <cit> . leukemias with rearrangement of the mll gene have been shown to be characterized by the absence of hsa-mir- <dig> expression  <cit> . our mir-eqtl data support a relationship  between rs <dig> and the expression of hsa-mir- <dig>  furthermore, a snp rs <dig>  has been found to be associated with exacerbation rates in asthma patients treated with montelukast  <cit> . our data support a relationship between this snp and the expression of mir-146b , which has been implicated in asthma pathogenesis in murine models of acute and chronic asthma  <cit> . as the detailed mechanisms underlying numerous genotype-phenotype correlations in both disease genomics and pharmacogenomics remain largely unknown, our study provides important hypotheses for future investigations. to this end, we make the results of our study available to the scientific community through an online public resource  <cit> .

using q-pcr, we were able to confirm the expression of two mirnas and two mrnas, the inverse correlations between these mirnas and mrnas, and an identified mir-eqtl, despite the limited sample size due to the availability of rna. although the biological interactions between the mirnas and the mrnas will require extensive experimental validation , our study generates, in aggregate, numerous hypotheses that warrant continued investigations and that may have substantial impact on the study of human diseases as well as on pharmacogenetics.

CONCLUSIONS
our comprehensive catalog of mir-eqtls in liver suggests numerous functional links to important disease traits and drug response phenotypes. the discovery of genetic variations that influence mirna expression  facilitates a genomic annotation approach that is likely to lead to more robust associations between variants and complex human phenotypes.
