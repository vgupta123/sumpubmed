BACKGROUND
the aggregation phenomenon in lactococci has been studied for more than thirty years. it was found to be directly associated with a sex factor and lactose plasmid co-integration event  <cit>  or duplication of the cell wall spanning  domain of prtp proteinase  <cit> . lactose plasmid conjugation in lactococcus lactis  <dig> and in the related strains c <dig> and ml <dig>  frequently involves plasmid co-integration with a sex factor. moreover, this phenomenon is often associated with a cell aggregation phenotype and high frequency transfer ability  <cit> . the lactococcal sex factor exists integrated in the chromosome  <cit> , although it can be excised as a closed circular form and lost from the cell  <cit> . deletion and over-expression experiments confirmed that clua is the only sex factor component responsible for aggregation in l. lactis. this  <dig> kda surface-bound protein, encoded by the chromosomally located sex factor of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig>  is associated with cell aggregation linked to high-frequency transfer  <cit> . two domains of clua involved in distinct functions were determined. the region from d153-i <dig> is important for promoting cell-to-cell binding , whereas k784-k <dig> tra domain is involved in dna transfer and responsible for high conjugation frequency  <cit> . furthermore, the aggregation ability of l. lactis subsp. lactis bgmn1- <dig> and its cured derivative was dependent on the presence of the plasmid encoded extracellular proteinase, prtp  <cit> . the prtp proteinase of bgmn1- <dig> contains a duplication of the c-terminal cell wall spanning domain . experiments in which hybrids of bgmn1- <dig> prtp, containing one or more cws domains were constructed, showed that only cells producing a fusion protein with two or more cws domains sedimented. sedimentation resulted from specific interaction between cws domains  <cit> . it is interesting that both, clua protein and prtp proteinase, have an lpxtg pentapeptide at the carboxy terminus, which is conserved among many cell surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . in gram-positive bacteria, these proteins have a multitude of functions, which include binding to host cells and/or tissues or specific immune system components, protein processing, nutrient acquisition and interaction between bacteria during conjugation  <cit> . many cell-surface proteins are involved in aggregation and adhesion processes, including the colonization of oral and commensal bacteria  <cit>  and initiation of infection by pathogens  <cit> . pathogenic gram-positive bacteria express cell surface proteins that contribute to virulence  <cit> . the genes encoding the surface proteins derived from several enterococcus faecalis plasmids, including pad <dig>  ppd <dig> and pcf <dig> have been sequenced  <cit>  and over-expressed in different bacteria including lactococcus lactis  <cit> . it was found that aggregation substance , a surface protein of e. faecalis, might contribute to virulence  <cit> .

l. lactis subsp. lactis bgkp <dig> was selected in our laboratory as a specific strain due to the expression of a unique auto-aggregation phenotype. in the present study, we isolated a non-aggregating derivative  of bgkp <dig> and performed comparative analysis. we found that a cell surface protein of high molecular mass, around  <dig> kda, is responsible for the aggregation. the gene encoding for aggregation protein  was mapped on plasmid pkp <dig> . the gene was cloned, sequenced and expressed in homologous and heterologous lactococcal and enterococcal hosts, showing that aggl protein is responsible for cell aggregation in lactococci. therefore, we propose aggl as a novel lactococcal aggregation factor.

RESULTS
aggregation may play the main role in adhesion of bacteria to the gastrointestinal epithelium and their colonization ability, as well as in probiotic effects through co-aggregation with intestinal pathogens and their subsequent removal.

isolation and comparative analyses of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bgkp <dig> and its non-aggregating derivative bgkp1-20
considering the importance of aggregation, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bgkp <dig> was selected during the characterization of microflora of artisanal white semi-hard homemade cheeses manufactured in the village of rendara  on kopaonik mountain, serbia. among  <dig> lactic acid bacteria , lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bgkp <dig> was chosen for further study due to its strong auto-aggregation phenotype .

bgkp <dig> is a lactose positive, bacteriocin and proteinase non-producing strain. the aggregation phenotype may be observed after vigorous mixing of a stationary phase culture, when snowflake-like aggregates become visible . the aggregates of bgkp <dig> cells differed in appearance from those of l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> expressing clua or l. lactis subsp. lactis bgmn1- <dig>  aggregates rapidly sedimented under resting conditions and more than 95% of bgkp <dig> cells aggregated in the first minute, as observed by the decrease of cell suspension absorbance . bgkp <dig> cell aggregates resemble those of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgsj2- <dig>  <cit> . the aggregation ability of bgkp <dig> was lost spontaneously after transfer of cells from -80°c to 30°c, with a frequency of 5% to 10%, as previously shown for bgsj2- <dig>  <cit> . the resulting non-aggregating derivative  of bgkp <dig> was designated as bgkp1- <dig>  agg+ cells formed smaller and prominent colonies, whereas agg- derivatives showed flat colonies on agar plates. mutations in genes encoding biofilm-associated proteins were also shown to result in transformation of colony morphology  <cit> . since bgkp <dig> and bgkp1- <dig> were not able to form biofilms on plastic tissue culture plates, the aggregation phenomenon present in bgkp <dig> is most probably not linked to biofilm formation. spontaneous high-frequency loss of the trait indicated a plasmid location of the gene encoding the aggregation phenotype. comparative analysis of the fitness of bgkp <dig> and bgkp1- <dig> in the exponential phase of growth showed differences in generation times between the strains. the doubling time for bgkp <dig> was  <dig>  min , while that for bgkp1- <dig> was  <dig>  min . the presence of the aggregation phenotype resulted in a significantly prolonged doubling time for bgkp <dig>  when compared with that of bgkp1- <dig>  taking into consideration that bacteria maintain and procure gene coding for the aggregation factor in spite of the energy cost, we could hypothesize that this feature provides some benefit for the cell.

nature of molecules involved in aggregation
the spontaneous loss of the capacity to aggregate in bgkp <dig> was tested under various conditions. aggregation capacity was found to be reversibly lost after repeated washing of bgkp <dig> cells with bi-distilled water. nevertheless, when washed bgkp <dig> cells that had lost the agg+ phenotype were re-suspended in the wash material, they re-gained the ability to aggregate. obviously, a some molecule with a role in aggregation were washed from the cell wall. however, aggregation was not observed when bgkp1- <dig> agg- cells were re-suspended in wash material from bgkp <dig> agg+. to check the nature of molecules involved in the aggregation, bgkp <dig> agg+ cells were treated with proteinase k prior to washing by water. the wash material of proteinase k-treated cells did not restore the aggregation ability of bgkp <dig> agg- washed cells. results indicated that the aggregation factor is of proteinaceous nature. since a protein is involved in aggregation, the influence of various ph levels and the concentration of five ions  on this phenomenon was examined. it was found that ph did not have as strong impact on the ability of bgkp <dig> to aggregate as cations did, especially iron. the presence of  <dig> mm fecl <dig> promoted aggregation of bgkp <dig> washed cells.

cell surface protein profiles of bgkp <dig> and the agg- derivative bgkp1- <dig> were compared in order to detect any differences between strains. as demonstrated for bgsj2- <dig>  <cit> , the sds-page pattern of cell surface proteins from bgkp <dig> and bgkp1- <dig> differed. thus, agg+ contained an additional ≈ <dig> kda protein, which was absent from the bgkp1- <dig> agg- derivative . this suggested that the aforementioned protein might be responsible for the aggregation. the protein detected and potentially involved in the aggregation of l. lactis subsp. lactis bgkp <dig> had a slightly smaller molecular mass than that of l. paracasei subsp. paracasei bgsj2- <dig> 

localization and cloning of genes linked to the aggregation phenomenon
plasmid profile analysis  of parental strain bgkp <dig> and the agg- derivative bgkp1- <dig> showed differences in one plasmid designated as pkp <dig>  indicating its potential role in the expression of the aggregation phenotype .

in order to facilitate cloning and expression of gene responsible for the aggregation phenotype in homologous and heterologous hosts, new lactococcal-e. coli shuttle cloning vectors pazil and pazilcos, based on pacyc <dig>  <cit>  and pil <dig>  <cit>  were constructed . these vectors enabled cloning of large dna fragments , blue-white selection for the inserted fragments and high stability of the constructs. the plasmid library of pkp <dig> constructed in pazil enabled sequencing and subsequent in silico analysis of the obtained sequence.

sequence analyses of plasmid pkp1
the complete sequence of plasmid pkp <dig> was found to consist of  <dig> bp, with a g+c content of  <dig> %. within the  <dig> bp long nucleotide sequence of pkp <dig> , a 99% identity with the psrq <dig> plasmid of lactococcus lactis  was determined. this sequence represented approximately one fourth of the pkp <dig> nucleotide sequence. this region encompassed the origin of replication, repb gene, repx replication associated gene and putative hsds gene . the rest of the nucleotide sequence  did not share identity with psrq <dig> and carried three genes, including two new genes  and one known transposase gene, which implies its novelty.

in addition, seven open reading frames  were revealed in pkp <dig> by application of the dna strider program . it is interesting that all orfs on the plasmid were in the same orientation except the gene encoding for transposase. two potential orfs, designated as aggl and mbpl, were additionally analysed. blast search revealed that aggl gene showed no similarity with any of the genes from the ncbi blast database, while aggl protein shared 51% identity with a hypothetical protein from oenococcus oeni awrib <dig> . the nucleotide sequence of mbpl shared 84% identity with orf from leuconostoc citreum km <dig> plasmid plck <dig> and 53% amino acid identity with a protein from enterococcus faecalis tx <dig> . motif scan http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan and das transmembrane domain  <cit>  programs were used to analyse their potential protein products. it was revealed that aggl included several motifs important for cell adhesion, such as a collagen-binding domain with a jelly-roll fold , cnab-like domain  as well as serine and threonine-rich domains . mbpl contained a mucbp-like domain and ysirk-signal. both aggl and mbpl were predicted to have the gram-positive cocci cell wall anchoring domain  and two transmembrane domains . additionally, both proteins had short amino acid repeat regions at the n-terminus, serine and threonine rich regions for aggl and an alanine rich region for mbpl. mbpl had five identical consecutive repeats at its n-terminus, each encompassing  <dig> aa  starting at position  <dig> and ending at position  <dig>  and two identical repeats at its c-terminus consisting of  <dig> aa , the first at position 750- <dig> and the second at 890- <dig>  at its c-terminus, aggl protein encompassed four repeats of  <dig> aa  organised in two pairs with a space of  <dig> aa between repeats and  <dig> aa between pairs  .

aa - amino acid

primary structural analysis of aggl revealed domain organization similar to lpxtg proteins of gram-positive cocci. the lpxtg motif is a highly conserved part of the c-terminal sorting signal and it plays a role in the covalent linkage of many cell-wall-associated surface proteins to the nascent pentaglycine crossbridge in peptidoglycan  <cit> . for example, s. aureus is known to express  <dig> proteins with the lpxtg motif including two clumping factors clfa and clfb  <cit> . another characteristic of aggl primary protein structure is modular architecture and a number of repeat regions that share high mutual identity . previous studies on staphylococcal lpxtg proteins indicated modular architecture and b repeats as their specific characteristics. such organization could have arisen during evolution through the acquisition of distinct domain-sized polypeptides of which some have expanded by duplication and homologous recombination  <cit> . collagen-binding protein b domain  is the most abundant domain of aggl. such a structure might mediate bacterial adherence to collagen. repeated units have been suggested to serve as a 'stalk' that projects the region crucial for adherence to the bacterial surface, thus facilitating bacterial adherence to collagen. additionally, the n-terminal serine and threonine rich domains of aggl could play a role in aggregation, since it is known that such domains of cd <dig> protein promote efficient adherence of neisseria gonorrhoeae to host cells  <cit> . interestingly, the ysirk domain, another characteristic of staphylococcal lpxtg proteins, was not found in aggl, although it was present within the signal peptide of mbpl. the requirement of a ysirk motif for efficient secretion implies the existence of a specialized mode of substrate recognition by the secretion pathway of gram-positive cocci. however, this mechanism is not essential for the surface protein to anchor to the cell wall envelope  <cit> . considering the primary protein organization of mbpl, its role in the cell could most likely be interaction with gastrointestinal epithelial cells. interestingly, the search for lactococcal proteins similar to aggl and mbpl against the ncbi blast database revealed that aggl shared identity only within its n-terminal region . on the other hand, mbpl shared identity within its c-terminal region .

homologous and heterologous expression of the aggl gene
cloning of different fragments of plasmid pkp <dig> into the pazil vector  and transfer of constructs into three lactococcal strains  revealed that the aggl gene is sufficient for the aggregation phenotype . furthermore, aggregation of enterococcal cells carrying the aggl gene was observed, but the intensity of cell aggregation was lower than that obtained in lactococci .

this conclusion was confirmed by transformation of the same lactococci with two types of constructs: pazil harboring pkp <dig> linearized in the aggl gene, that results in the inactivation of this gene  and by constructs carrying the dna fragment of pkp <dig> containing solely the aggl gene  . it was noticed that cell aggregation phenotypes of mg <dig> and bgkp1- <dig> transformants, carrying the aggl gene, were identical to those of the parental strain bgkp <dig>  transformants of bgmn1- <dig> showed the aggregation phenotype with slightly different cell aggregates, which were smaller than in bgkp <dig> .

the location of the gene involved in the aggregation of bgkp <dig> on plasmid pkp <dig> potentially enables transfer of this factor through the microbial population.

experiments with heterologous expression of aggl and/or mbpl revealed the main role of aggl protein in the aggregation phenomena. according to the morphological characteristics of cell aggregates in heterologous strains, we can assume that even though aggl is crucial for aggregation, some additional protein  might have a modulatory effect on the aggregation phenotype. additionally, preliminary ex vivo experiments with rat colon sections indicated that aggl is not involved in adhesion to the gastrointestinal epithelium .

further experiments will be focused on studies of aggl and mbpl interactions with human epithelial cells and their role in the adhesion and possible probiotic potential of bgkp <dig>  moreover, co-aggregation with various pathogenic bacteria will be also tested.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that in lactococci, a novel aggregation-promoting factor aggl is encoded by the aggl gene located on the  <dig>  kb pkp <dig> plasmid. moreover, functionality of aggl was confirmed by homologous and heterologous expression of different clones containing or lacking this gene in the newly constructed shuttle-cloning vector, pazil.
