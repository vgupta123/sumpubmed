BACKGROUND
wheat  is an important food crop providing a fifth of the world’s calorie intake. wheat is grown on more than  <dig> million hectares and cultivated across more regions of the world than any other staple crop  <cit> . wheat diseases caused by various pathogens cause significant yield loss across the world. of these, the rust fungi cause serious diseases of wheat and pose significant constraints to wheat production. the three wheat rust diseases are stem, leaf, and stripe  rust, caused by puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici eriks. & e. henn., puccinia triticina eriks., and puccinia striiformis westend. f.sp. tritici erikss., respectively  <cit> .

wheat leaf rust occurs more frequently and is more prevalent globally than other cereal rust pathogens  <cit> . in the eastern prairies of canada, annual yield losses due to leaf rust are estimated at  <dig> to 15% when susceptible wheat cultivars are grown  <cit> . leaf rust can be effectively controlled by applying fungicides or through genetic resistance. of these, host resistance is the most efficient, economical, and environmentally effective means to control this disease. in addition, there is the possibility that rust pathogens may develop resistance to fungicides  <cit> . to date,  <dig> numerically designated wheat leaf rust resistance  genes have been identified and catalogued . additionally, a small number of race-specific seedling stage leaf rust resistance genes have been cloned, including lr <dig>  lr <dig>  and lr <dig> . all of these resistance  genes were found to belong to the coiled-coil, nucleotide binding site, leucine rich repeat  class of r proteins. lr <dig> was the first wheat resistance gene to be cloned that provides partial resistance to multiple pathogens  <cit> . more recently, the partial leaf rust resistance gene lr <dig> was also cloned  <cit> . lr <dig> and lr <dig> encode a putative abc transporter and a hexose transporter, respectively. lr <dig> is likely a member of the cc-nb-lrr class of r proteins given its activity at the seedling stage and race-specificity. although many wheat leaf rust  resistance genes have been identified, virulence mutations in the p. triticina population have overcome host resistance conferred by a number of lr genes . to mitigate the problem posed by the evolution of new virulent races of the pathogen, deployment of multiple lr genes or gene pyramiding is recommended to promote the durability of lr genes  <cit> .


lr <dig> is a seedling leaf rust resistance gene, conditioning an incompatible interaction with a distinct necrotic ring surrounding the uredinium  <cit> . in canada, lr <dig> was first deployed in the variety selkirk  <cit> . virulence to lr <dig> was first detected in canada in  <dig>  although considered a defeated gene, lr <dig> still retains a partial resistance effect against virulent p. triticina isolates and still offers protection against wheat leaf rust in canada  <cit> . it is widely deployed and is particularly effective against the north american p. triticina population when pyramided with lr <dig> . the exact nature of the interaction with lr <dig> is not understood, but similar interactions were reported between lr <dig> and lr <dig>  lr2a, lr <dig>  lr3ka, lr <dig>  lr <dig>  lr <dig>  and lrb  <cit> . genetic analysis has revealed the presence of lr <dig> in the canadian wheat cultivars ‘ac domain’, ‘ac karma’, ‘ac majestic’, ‘ac splendor’, ‘columbus’, the american cultivar ‘grandin’, and in other cultivars elsewhere  <cit> . resistance conferred by lr <dig> has been utilized in wheat breeding programs in canada and around the world.


lr <dig> has been mapped to the terminal region of wheat chromosome arm 2bs  <cit> . previous studies have identified simple sequence repeat  markers that were linked with lr <dig> on chromosome arm 2bs  <cit> . however, lack of distally flanking markers has hampered the fine mapping and cloning efforts of lr <dig> and slowed the development of diagnostic molecular markers for marker-assisted selection . thus, the main objectives of the present study were to map lr <dig> in multiple mapping populations, develop numerous snp markers for the lr <dig> region, and identify snp markers that are tightly linked with lr <dig> and useful for efficient selection of lr <dig> in wheat breeding programs.

methods
mapping populations
four mapping populations were used in this study. an f6‐derived recombinant inbred line  population  was developed from the cross of bw <dig>  with ‘ac foremost’ . bw <dig> is a canadian spring wheat breeding line that carries lr <dig>  and ‘ac foremost’ is canadian spring wheat cultivar that is susceptible to p. triticina isolate 12– <dig> mbds at the seedling stage. the ‘ac majestic’/‘glenlea’ population consisted of 400 f1-derived doubled haploid  lines. ‘ac majestic’  is a canadian spring wheat cultivar that carries lr <dig>  while ‘glenlea’  is a canadian spring wheat cultivar that is susceptible to p. triticina isolate 12– <dig> mbds at the seedling stage. the rl4452/‘ac domain’ f1-derived doubled haploid population  was generated from the cross of the susceptible wheat line rl <dig> , which is susceptible to p. triticina isolate 12– <dig> mbds at the seedling stage, with the resistant  canadian spring wheat ‘ac domain’ . the fourth population was developed from a ril population of  <dig> lines of the cross ‘kenyon’/86ismn  <dig>  ‘kenyon’  is a canada western red spring  cultivar that carries lr <dig> , while 86ismn  <dig> is of unknown origin and is susceptible to p. triticina isolate 12– <dig> mbds at the seedling stage. the ‘kenyon’/86ismn  <dig> mapping population was developed and provided by dr. g.r. hughes, university of saskatchewan, crop development centre. all other mapping populations were developed by the authors at agriculture and agri-food canada.

seedling tests with race mbds 
tests for leaf rust resistance conditioned by lr <dig> were done at the seedling stage as previously described  <cit> . seeds were planted in clumps of approximately  <dig> seeds evenly spaced in fibre flats . approximately  <dig> d after seeding, the seedlings at the two leaf stage were inoculated with urediniospores of p. triticina isolate 12– <dig> mbds  mixed with a light mineral oil  sprayed onto the leaves using a compressed air sprayer. this p. triticina isolate is fully avirulent on lr <dig> carriers. the plants were allowed to dry, to evaporate the mineral oil, for at least 1 h then moved to a 100% humidity cabinet for approximately 17 h of incubation. the plants were then moved to a greenhouse at 20 ± 4 °c with supplemental lighting. after approximately  <dig> d, plants were rated for symptoms using a ‘0’ to ‘4’ infection scale where ‘0’ , ‘;’ , ‘1’ , and ‘2’  were considered resistant responses and ‘3’  and ‘4’  were considered susceptible responses  <cit> .

dna marker development
ssr markers linked to lr <dig> were identified for analysis based on previous research  <cit> . previous studies mapped lr <dig> to the terminal region of wheat chromosome bin 2bs <dig> . all sequences of previously mapped ssr, diversity arrays technology , and snp markers near lr <dig> were used as queries in the blastn search of the brachypodium genome to identify orthologous loci. wheat est  that were mapped to bin 2bs <dig>  and publically available west sequences which are orthologous to putative brachypodium genes within the syntenic genomic region on chromosome  <dig> were used for developing conserved primers using conservedprimers  <dig>  software  <cit> .

snp markers were developed with multiple strategies. linked wheat 90 k infinium snp markers  <cit>  were identified by genotyping the rl4452/‘ac domain’ and bw278/‘ac foremost’ mapping populations. kasp assays were designed for these snps and tested on the other populations.

in addition, a blast search using sequences of previously mapped markers on chromosome arm 2bs was performed to identify putative snp markers linked to the lr <dig> locus. the wheat 90 k iselect infinium assay  <cit>  and the snp database at cerealsdb  <cit>  were used to mine snps. additional snp markers were also developed through comparative synteny analysis using brachypodium and rice genomes. here, syntenic brachypodium and rice genes were used as queries in blastn searches against the wheat chromosome arm 2bs survey sequence to identify putative syntenic wheat genes. these wheat genes were then used as queries in blastn searches of the cerealsdb snp database  <cit> . genomic resources at ncbi  <cit>  and graingenes  <cit>  were utilized to discover additional snp markers linked with lr <dig> 

whole exome capture  data  <cit>  of chromosome 2bs was also utilized to mine snp markers associated with lr <dig>  bulked segregant analysis  coupled with wec sequencing was used to identify snps. four sets of dna  were sequenced with illumina short read technology  and assembled against the wec reference sequence. snp variants were called that accurately differentiated the resistant and susceptible lines and bulks, respectively.

finally, all potential genes from chromosome arm 2bs survey sequence of hexaploid wheat variety chinese spring  <cit>  were predicted using gene prediction software genemark  <cit> . resistance gene analogs  from the genes on 2bs were identified using the rga prediction pipeline program rgaugury  <cit> , although chinese spring does not have lr <dig>  rgas linked with the lr <dig> locus were detected using previously mapped markers. blast was used to identify wheat rgas co-linear with rgas in brachypodium and rice as described above. rga-based snp markers were developed from sequences of rgas sanger sequenced in wheat lines with and without lr <dig>  moreover, a blast search of snps from the cerealsdb wheat snp database  <cit>  and the 90 k wheat infinium snp array was conducted using sequences of the filtered rga contigs as queries to identify snp markers putatively linked to the lr <dig> locus. rga-based markers linked with lr <dig> were also identified from rna sequences  and an in silico subtraction method  <cit> . polymorphic snps were genotyped on the appropriate mapping populations and used for linkage analysis.

dna marker analyses and genotyping
genomic dna for the populations, ‘ac majestic’/‘glenlea’, rl4452/‘ac domain’ and kenyon/86ismn  <dig>  were extracted from lyophilized fresh leaf tissue using the dneasy plant dna extraction kit . for the bw278/‘ac foremost’ population, dna from lyophilized fresh leaf tissue was extracted using a modified ammonium acetate method as described previously  <cit> . stock dna concentration was estimated with a fluorometer using hoechst  <dig> stain and diluted to a working concentration of 15 ng/μl. all of the snps identified were genotyped using the kasp assay  <cit> . using dna sequence flanking the variant snp position, two allele-specific forward primers and one common reverse primer were designed . pcr conditions and kasp assays were performed using methods as previously described  <cit> . fluorescence detection of the pcr products was performed using an omega fluorostar plate reader . the data were analyzed using klustercaller software . only snp markers that showed high quality allele calls were used for linkage analysis. the quality of the marker was determined based on the cluster quality of the scatter plot and by comparing the allele call of each genotype with alleles of the parental lines. datapoints that did not fit within clusters were scored as missing data and were excluded from linkage analysis. pcr conditions and genotyping methods for ssr markers were previously described  <cit> , and the same protocol was used to test the sequence characterized amplified region  marker pwm <dig> and the conservedprimer marker pwm <dig> 

linkage analysis
a linkage map of the region of chromosome arm 2bs carrying lr <dig> was constructed for each mapping population using mapdisto  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . loci were analyzed for conformation to a mendelian segregation ratio  using a χ
 <dig> test. a minimum lod  threshold of  <dig>  and maximum recombination fraction of  <dig>  were used to identify linkage groups. recombination fractions were converted into map distances using the kosambi mapping function  <cit> .

haplotype analysis of wheat lines with lr <dig> snp markers
marker haplotype analysis was performed on a panel of  <dig> wheat lines and cultivars to evaluate the diagnostic potential of snp markers linked with lr <dig> for mas. this collection of wheat germplasm was assembled by dr. d.j. somers, formerly of agriculture and agri-food canada, from western canadian wheat breeders. the wheat cultivars and breeding lines were previously tested with p. triticina isolate 12– <dig> mbds and have known infection types. the panel consists of cultivars and breeding lines from nine canadian wheat marketing classes, which represent different grain quality profiles for different end-uses. considerable diversity exists between these marketing classes. the haplotype panel also included wheats from  <dig> additional countries to further broaden the diversity sampled . most wheat lines in the haplotype panel were susceptible to isolate 12– <dig> mbds . the few resistant lines included in the haplotype panel were known carriers of lr <dig> 

RESULTS
phenotypic evaluation
each of the mapping populations  fitted a  <dig> resistant :  <dig> susceptible segregation ratio, indicating single gene segregation for resistance to p. triticina isolate 12– <dig> mbds . although each of these parental lines carries a number of leaf rust resistance genes, the isolate used here  was virulent on those genes, except for lr <dig> on which it was avirulent. resistant lines in these populations had the infection type ‘1’ with a large necrotic ring around a small uredinium, characteristic of lr <dig>  whereas susceptible lines had infection types ‘3’ or ‘4’.table  <dig> segregation of lr <dig> in four wheat populations, including χ

marker development
the scar marker pwm <dig> was developed from the dart marker wpt- <dig> that mapped near lr <dig>  and the conservedprimer marker pwm <dig> was developed from the west bf <dig> that was mapped on the distal end of chromosome 2bs.

snp markers were identified from publicly available wheat genomic resources and snp databases using sequences of previously mapped markers linked to the lr <dig> locus on chromosome 2bs, syntenic genes of brachypodium and rice genomes and from rgas identified from rna-seq and in silico subtraction. snps were also identified from sequences of rgas that were tightly linked with lr <dig>  a total of  <dig> putative snp loci were identified. of these,  <dig> snps were mined from cerealsdb using wests, ssrs, and darts located on chromosome arm 2bs as blast queries or were reported on cerealsdb as tentatively mapped to chromosome arm 2bs  <cit> ,  <dig> snps from 90 k iselect infinium array  <cit> , six snps were from rgas identified through rna-seq and in silico subtraction analysis  <cit> ,  <dig> snps were from the exome sequence of bw278/‘ac foremost’ population  <cit> , and  <dig> snps were identified from cerealsdb or the 90 k wheat infinium snp array using syntenic genes in brachypodium and rice genomes as blast queries. additionally,  <dig> snp markers were derived from coding sequence  of rgas tightly linked with lr <dig>  kasp assays were designed for snps and tested on the parents of the four mapping populations, which yielded  <dig>  polymorphic snps that were tested for linkage.

lr <dig> genetic linkage map
a total of  <dig> high quality new snp markers and two pcr markers  were mapped on chromosome arm 2bs linked with the resistance gene lr <dig> across the four mapping populations . the snps were selected based on cluster quality of the allele calls as revealed on the kasp genotyping assay. three ssr markers  were previously mapped relative to lr <dig>  <cit> . genetic positions and marker order were consistent across the four populations  and no marker deviated from the expected 1: <dig> mendelian segregation ratio . in all four populations, lr <dig> was flanked distally by the snp marker bs00099465_kwm <dig> while the ssr marker wmc <dig> was the proximal flanking marker in all populations except ‘kenyon’/86ismn  <dig>  the snp marker 2bs-5157588_kwm <dig> flanked lr <dig> proximally in both the ‘kenyon’/86ismn  <dig> and bw278/‘ac foremost’ populations. it is worth noting that 2bs-5182563_kwm <dig> was the closest proximal flanking marker of lr <dig> in bw278/‘ac foremost’ while it co-segregated with lr <dig> in ‘kenyon’/86ismn  <dig>  this result was not unexpected given the higher genetic resolution of bw278/‘ac foremost’, which consisted of  <dig> rils . similarly, the snp marker kukri_c6626_57_kwm <dig> was the closest distal flanking marker in the bw278/‘ac foremost’ and ‘ac majestic’/‘glenlea’ populations. one ssr and nine snp markers were mapped in all the four populations while the remaining markers were mapped in one, two or three populations . of the ten markers mapped in all populations, an ssr  and eight snp markers  co-segregated with lr <dig>  five of the co-segregating snps were derived from three rgas found in the lr <dig> region. the snps bs00108724_kwm <dig>  2bs-5175914_kwm <dig>  and 2bs-5175914_kwm <dig> were derived from the same rga, while 2bs-5203447_kwm <dig> and 2bs-5194460_kwm <dig> were from two additional rgas. a snp marker identified from rna-seq and in silico subtraction analysis  co-segregated with lr <dig> in the bw278/‘ac foremost’ population. snp16_tp <dig> and 2bs-5194460_kwm <dig> were derived from the same rga.fig.  <dig> genetic linkage maps calculated for four mapping populations showing the location of the leaf rust resistance gene lr <dig> on wheat chromosome arm 2bs. lines identify markers in common between adjacent linkage maps. the ruler on the left of the linkage maps is scaled in centimorgans 




haplotype analysis
the eight snp markers that co-segregated with lr <dig> in all four populations were tested on a diverse set of  <dig> wheat lines and cultivars . all lines and cultivars were previously tested with leaf rust race 12– <dig> mbds and have a known genotype at the lr <dig> locus. the panel was comprised of  <dig> resistant lines , while the remaining lines were susceptible  . six of the snp markers  were consistent with lr <dig> phenotype and were completely predictive of lr <dig> for all wheat lines/cultivars in the panel . all these markers have exhibited high quality clustering as kasp assays when testing homozygous lines . of the six predictive snp markers, 2bs-5194460_kwm <dig>  2bs-5192454_kwm <dig>  2bs-5175914_kwm <dig>  and 2bs-5175914_kwm <dig> were best for distinguishing heterozygotes  and are well suited for mas of lr <dig> in wheat breeding programs.table  <dig> haplotype data of wheat lines with six snp loci co-segregating with lr16

discussion
in the present work, we were able to develop numerous new markers that delineate the lr <dig> interval on the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 2b. a higher resolution snp linkage map for lr <dig> was developed using four independent mapping populations, which represent approximately  <dig> , approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gametes . in total,  <dig> snp and two pcr markers were mapped in the lr <dig> interval that was localized within ~  <dig>  cm.


lr <dig> is a race-specific seedling stage resistance gene  <cit> . previously characterized seedling stage leaf rust resistance genes  were found to be rgas . the majority of wheat r genes have coiled coil , nucleotide-binding-site , and leucine-rich-repeat  motifs, and are referred to as cnl type r genes. various studies have reported that r genes are often present in clusters in the genomes of many species. here, we identified three rga-like genes clustered near the lr <dig> locus and five snp markers , which were developed from these rgas and co-segregated with lr <dig> in all mapping populations .

stacking  of multiple resistance genes is necessary to prolong resistance durability and enhance effective use of lr genes  <cit> . lr <dig> has been shown to confer effective resistance in leaf rust nurseries when combined with adult-plant r genes such as lr <dig> and lr <dig>  <cit> . in fact, lr <dig> does not provide effective resistance in canada when used as the sole source of leaf rust resistance  <cit> . thus, diagnostic molecular markers are necessary to stack lr <dig> with other lr genes through mas. here we found six snp markers that were predictive of the presence or absence of lr <dig> in the diverse set of wheat germplasm tested . kasp assays were designed for snps that can readily be used in wheat breeding programs. the utility of the snp markers was confirmed using a panel of  <dig> wheat lines/cultivars. the panel included reference stocks, spelt wheat, and a diverse set of cultivars and breeding lines from canada, usa, asia, australia, north africa, and south america with known genotype at the lr <dig> locus . the canadian wheat cultivars and breeding lines comprised different marketing classes with different end-use functionality.


lr <dig> is believed to be originally sourced from five wheat cultivars, ‘columbus’, ‘warden’, ‘exchange’, ‘selkirk’, and ‘etoile de choisy’  <cit> . ‘ac domain’, ‘kanata’ and ‘columbus’ inherited lr <dig> from rl <dig>  subsequently, the wheat line bw <dig> inherited lr <dig> from ‘ac domain’, while ‘ac barrie’, ‘ac majestic’, ‘mckenzie’ and ‘prodigy’ inherited lr <dig> from ‘columbus’. for kenyon, the source of lr <dig> was ‘buck manantial’. the wheat cultivar ‘buck manantial’ was originally released in argentina and its source of lr <dig> could not be determined by the authors. the thatcher-lr <dig> differential line rl <dig> inherited lr <dig> from ‘exchange’. interestingly, both kenyon and rl <dig> have a different allele for the ssr marker wmc <dig> than the other lr <dig> carriers in this study  <cit> . the polymorphism at wmc <dig> between the lr <dig> carriers is most likely a relatively recent mutation since snps in the lr <dig> region do not differentiate the different sources of lr <dig>  six snp markers  presented in this work were completely predictive of lr <dig> in a diverse set of wheat germplasm and will be useful for mas of lr <dig>  interestingly, all the markers except 2bs-5192454_kwm <dig> were derived from rgas . these new snp markers will be useful in fine mapping and cloning of lr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
leaf rust resistance is a high priority for wheat breeders across the world. lr <dig> is a widely deployed r gene that provides effective resistance when pyramided with lr <dig>  lr <dig> was mapped to chromosome arm 2bs relative to numerous snp markers in four mapping populations. the position of lr <dig> relative to the dna markers was consistent in all crosses. six snps co-segregating with lr <dig> were identified that are individually predictive for the presence/absence of lr <dig> in a diverse set of  <dig> wheat lines. in this study, several approaches were used to develop markers, including  using previously mapped ssr, dart and snp markers,  developing conserved primers using west,  mining snp markers based on sequences of previously mapped markers or comparative synteny analysis with brachypodium and rice, and  rga-based snp marker development. of the  <dig> snps identified in this study, only  <dig> snps  were developed from rgas. however, five of the six predictive and co-segregating snp markers were derived from rgas. this demonstrates that rga-based marker development is an effective approach for fine mapping and further cloning of resistance genes. the new predictive snp markers developed here will enable efficient selection of lr <dig> in wheat breeding programs and will be useful for further cloning efforts of lr <dig>
