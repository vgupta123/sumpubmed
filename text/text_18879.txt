BACKGROUND
to respond to environmental fluctuations, bacteria employ a large and elaborate family of two-component signaling systems. the classical two-component system consists of a sensor kinase and its cognate response regulator  <cit> . in response to the signal input, the kinase phosphorylates its own histidine residue. the phosphoryl group is then transferred to a conserved aspartate residue on the cognate response regulator, which then acts as a transcription factor in most cases. given the many studies on how response regulator regulates output response by phosphorylation, it is not surprising that variable strategies were found  <cit> . upon phosphorylation, some regulators dimerize to be activated or interact with other proteins or dna  <cit> , while other regulators are relieved from inhibition by their n-terminal domain  <cit> . one such two-component system in the gram-positive soil bacterium bacillus subtilis consists of the response regulator degu and its cognate histidine kinase degs. degu belongs to the narl family, whose members have a helix-turn-helix structure at their c-terminus  <cit> . the degs-degu system regulates many cellular processes, including exoprotease production and competence development  <cit> . it has also been reported to sense salt stress and to mediate appropriate responses  <cit> . in addition, it was found recently that the protein machinery for chromosome separation  forms a complex with degs and inhibits its kinase activity  <cit> . the activity of degu itself has been shown to be finely tuned by several factors. the rap-phr systems are regulatory machinery to receive extracellular signals  <cit> . degu is negatively regulated by rapg since the protein inhibits its dna-binding activity  <cit> . rapg activity is in turn inhibited by its cognate extracellular pentapeptide phrg after the peptide is taken up by the cell. thus, the rapg-phrg system functions as a positive regulatory mechanism for degu. moreover, the transcription of rapg is repressed by rghr  <cit> .

unphosphorylated degu is required for competence development and binds to the promoter region of comk, which encodes a master regulator of competence development  <cit> . unphosphorylated degu has also been reported to facilitate the binding of comk to the comk promoter  <cit> . previously we identified a degu-recognized incomplete inverted repeat  on the comk promoter  by using various mutated comk-lacz fusions  <cit> . additional targets of unphosphorylated degu have not been identified.

phosphorylated degu  activates the expression of more than one hundred twenty genes, including apre  and sacb ; it also represses wapa, which encodes a cell-wall associated protein  <cit> . in addition, the expression of bpr, which encodes bacillopeptidase f, has been reported to be probably dependent on degu-p  <cit> . to date, the dna recognition sequence of degu-p has not been identified with the exception of apre and bpr. our analysis revealed that an important cis-factor for degu-dependent apre expression is a direct repeat  of the downstream half of the degu-recognized ir in the comk promoter with two-nucleotide spacing ,  <cit> . in addition, we identified three drs with zero or two-nucleotide spacing, which are important for degu-binding to the bpr promoter region and degu-p-dependent expression of bpr  <cit> . furthermore, overproduction of degu or the degu <dig> mutation, which renders degu-p resistant to dephoshorylation, resulted in a decrease in the expression of the fla/che operon encoding chemotaxis-related proteins and components of the flagella apparatus  <cit> .

since degu-p stimulates the transcription of many genes and unphosphorylated degu is required for comk transcription, degu is regarded as a molecular switch that controls cell fate  <cit> . however, what factor determines promoter selectivity of degu-p and unphosphorylated degu remains unclear.

in this paper, we found that flgb, which is the first gene of the 26-kb-long fla/che operon, is subject to direct positive regulation by unphosphorylated degu through two degu-binding sequences containing an ir-like sequence. in contrast, footprint analyses of the sacb promoter revealed that degu-p bound to a dr within the degu-binding sequence. since unphosphorylated degu bound to flgb, the arrangement of the degu-binding sequence within promoter regions  must dictate which form of degu  binds to them. this hypothesis was confirmed by expression analysis of sacb-lacz fusions carrying an artificial ir within their degu-binding sequence.

RESULTS
unphosphorylated degu binds to two ir-like sequences in flgb
while studying the interaction of degu with its target promoters, we found that unphosphorylated degu bound to two degu-binding regions present within flgb . br <dig> seems to contain an ir-like sequence  with long spacing , and br <dig> also seems to contain an ir-like sequence  with two-nucleotide spacing . next, we performed footprint analysis using his-tagged degu and obtained essentially similar protection profiles to those obtained by using untagged degu . previously, gel retardation analysis using unphosphorylated his-tagged degu showed that degu bound to an upstream region from the transcription start site of flgb, although the binding sequence was not identified  <cit> . it should be noted that each of the half sites of these two ir-like sequences shows similarity to the degu-recognition sequences in the comk promoter, although they are not perfect ir sequences. furthermore, phosphorylation of degu by his-tagged degs abrogated its binding to br <dig> but not that to br <dig>  based on these results, we concluded that unphosphorylated degu binds to two regions containing the ir-like sequence in the flgb regulatory region.

degu and swraa regulation of the expression of a f1d fusion carrying two brs
to examine the in vivo functions of the brs, we constructed a f1d fusion carrying both brs and measured the β-galactosidase activities of the fusion in various genetic backgrounds, including disruption mutation of degs or degu in the presence of active or inactive swraa . the degs mutation is an in-frame deletion, which results in acting as a non-polar type mutation to the downstream degu gene. the swraa gene has been reported to enhance flgb expression by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . in addition, this gene carries a frame-shift mutation in the  <dig> strain  <cit> . the transcription of the flgb fusion is solely driven by sigma a type rna polymerase, as the fusion lacks a promoter for sigma d type rna polymerase  <cit> . in the strain bearing functional swraa at an ectopic thrc locus, the expression of f1d was about four-fold higher than that in the  <dig>  strain, which is consistent with former results  <cit> . as unphosphorylated degu binds to two brs, it was expected that unphosphorylated degu would regulate the expression of f1d. if this were the case, then only the degu mutation but not the degs mutation would have an effect on fusion expression. as shown in figure 3a, in swraa and swraa+ backgrounds, the degu mutation decreased the expression of f1d, while the degs mutation had little or no effect. the effect of the degu mutation was more prominent in the swraa+ background than in the swraa background. these results indicated that unphosphorylated degu positively regulates f1d fusion expression. moreover, the degu <dig> mutation, which makes degu-p resistant to dephosphorylation  <cit> , reduced the expression of f1d 3-fold and  <dig> -fold in the swraa and swraa+ backgrounds, respectively. this observation is in good agreement with former results  <cit>  .

degu and swraa act on flgb expression through br1
to determine the in vivo role of br <dig> in the positive regulation of flgb by degu, we constructed a fusion carrying br <dig> alone  and tested its expression in various genetic backgrounds . as well as f1d, the expression of f <dig> was decreased in the degu but not degs background, suggesting positive regulation of f <dig> by unphosphorylated degu. the reduced expression in the presence of the degu mutation and the increased expression in the presence of functional swraa were abolished by introducing point mutations into the upstream and downstream half sites of the ir-like sequences in br <dig> and the long spacing region  or by deleting br <dig> . these results demonstrated that unphosphorylated degu binding to br <dig> is required for the positive regulation of flgb by degu, and for the enhancing effect of swraa. this result strongly suggested that at least part of the positive function of swraa is exercised through degu. in fact, in the degu strain carrying f1d, f1dm or f <dig>  swraa had little effect on the expression of flgb. surprisingly, the introduction of the degu <dig> mutation into a strain carrying f <dig> and swraa resulted in about a three-fold increase in the expression of f <dig>  which is not consistent with the results of the expression analysis of f1d. this positive effect of degu <dig> in the swraa strain was abolished by disrupting or deleting br <dig>  suggesting that higher cellular concentrations of degu-p may positively regulate flgb expression through increased binding of degu-p to br <dig>  however, this hypothesis is not in agreement with the result shown in figure  <dig>  we will discuss this discrepancy with respect to the binding of degu to br <dig> .

br <dig> appears to prevent the positive regulation of flgb by degu-p through br1
to investigate the in vivo role of br <dig>  we constructed a f2d fusion carrying an incomplete br <dig>  br <dig>  and the core promoter, and tested its β-galactosidase activities in various genetic backgrounds. the levels of expression of f2d in all of the genetic backgrounds tested were similar to those of the f <dig> fusion, which should reflect strength of the core promoter of flgb. moreover, the absence of effects of degu and functional swraa in f1md was reasonable, because f1md is equivalent to f2d with respect to distribution of brs. these results suggested that br <dig> is not involved in positive regulation by swraa and unphosphorylated degu. a comparison of the expression patterns of the f1d and f1dm fusions showed that there was essentially no difference except for the epistatic effect of the degu <dig> mutation. this suggested that br <dig> could have some role to play in the negative effect of the degu <dig> mutation on f1d expression. in the presence of br <dig>  the degu <dig> mutation did not exhibit positive regulation of flgb through br <dig>  while, in the absence of br <dig>  the mutation resulted in increased fusion expression. thus, br <dig> appears to prevent the positive regulation of flgb by degu-p through br <dig>  leading to downregulation of f1d in degu <dig> cells . in addition, degu-p bound to br <dig> could not serve as a repressor, because there was no significant effect of the degu <dig> mutation on f2d expression. it should be noted that the slight reducing effect of the degu <dig> mutation on f1md was observed in the swraa background. this is due to an unknown reason.

transcription start site of sacb
to characterize the interaction of degu-p with its targets, we selected sacb, which is a well-characterized gene belonging to the degu-p regulon. the degu-p dependency of sacb expression has been reported previously  <cit> . we determined the transcription start site of sacb by primer extension analysis . a previous analysis found that the transcription start site is seven-base downstream of the newly determined site  <cit> . this discrepancy is due to an unknown reason. the numbering of nucleotide of sacb was done based on our result hereafter.

footprint analysis of the sacb promoter region
to further characterize the interaction of degu with the sacb promoter, we performed dnase i footprint analysis . unphosphorylated degu had no effect on dnase i cleavage of the sacb promoter region, while degu-p protected the several regions on the both strands from dnase i cleavage. these results are consistent with degu-p-dependent regulation of the sacb gene observed in vivo. the region containing a dr  of the putative degu-binding sequence was only protected on the both strands. in addition, we found that his-tagged unphosphorylated degu was able to bind to the sacb promoter region in footprint analysis for an unknown reason . in the experiments using his-tagged degu the region containing the dr was protected from dnase i cleavage .

confirmation of the in vivo function of the detected dr by lacz fusion analysis
to confirm the functions of the detected degu-binding regions in vivo, we performed lacz fusion analysis. the expression of sacb is known to be regulated in two ways, namely, by degu-p and by the antitermination system involving sacy. it has been shown previously that the upstream and downstream regions of the core promoter are required for the former and latter regulatory mechanisms, respectively, and that the deletion of the downstream region resulted in high constitutive expression of sacb in the absence of sucrose  <cit> . thus, we only fused the upstream region of sacb to the lacz gene. sequential deletion of this sacb-lacz fusion revealed the importance of the - <dig> to - <dig> region in the sacb promoter . we introduced various point mutations and a deletion into the - <dig> to - <dig> region, which contains the degu-p binding sites, and examined their β-galactosidase activities. especially, the deletion of the region containing the dr resulted in the strongest effect on sacb expression  among the mutants tested. in addition, the m <dig> and m <dig> mutations disrupting the dr led to significant decreases in sacb-lacz expression. these results confirmed the functionality of the dr. furthermore the other detected degu-binding sites did not have significant in vivo roles, because the introduced mutations to the regions showed marginal effects on transcription of the fusions. we note that the mutation located immediately downstream of the dr  reduced fusion expression to some extent. notably, a previous deletion study had shown that the ability of the degu <dig> mutation to enhance sacb expression is dependent on the - <dig> to - <dig> region of the sacb promoter  <cit> ; this region contains the dr we identified. another interesting point is that the nucleotide change that yields the s-m <dig> point mutant makes the sequence of the upstream motif closer to the degu-p-binding consensus motif ; this led to a  <dig> -fold higher level of expression of the fusion compared to that of s-wt.

changing the dr to an ir in the sacb promoter results in degs-independent but degu-dependent regulation
according to the above results, it is possible that the ir-like and the dr sequences positively regulate gene expression by unphosphorylated degu and degu-p, respectively. the expression of apre and sacb, whose promoters carry a dr, is positively regulated by degu-p   <cit> . in addition, we found recently that three drs with zero or two-nucleotide spacing serve as positive cis-elements for degu-p in the regulatory region of bpr, which is a degu-p-regulated gene  <cit> . in contrast, the expression of comk and flgb, whose promoters carry ir and ir-like sequences, respectively, is regulated by unphosphorylated degu   <cit> . thus, we examined the effect of changing a dr to an ir on degs-dependent expression of the sacb-lacz fusion by replacing the downstream half of the sacb dr by that of comk ir with various spacers. the expression of wild-type sacb-lacz was dependent on both the degs and degu genes . in the case of sc-ir <dig>  expression of the fusion was not affected when the degs mutation was introduced, although the expression was still dependent on functional degu . this strongly suggested that changing the dr to an ir results in the appearance of unphosphorylated degu-dependent positive regulation. the other series of sc-ir fusions showed similar regulation patterns to that of sc-ir <dig> . next, we reversed the orientation of the downstream half site of sacb dr to make an artificial ir in the sacb promoter, which had the original sequence except for the insertion of one g nucleotide to make two-base spacing. this change rendered the expression of the sc-ir fusion resistant to the degs mutation to some extent. furthermore, unphosphoylated degu was able to bind to the ir in sc-ir <dig> in the footprint analysis . these results are further supports of our hypothesis.

another difference between the promoters of degu-regulated and degu-p-regulated genes is that the ir of comk and ir-like sequences of flgb  have long spacing regions, whereas the drs of apre, bpr and sacb have short spacing regions. thus, we examined whether a long spacer between the two half sites of sacb dr might alter its regulation. the introduction of a long spacer corresponding to that of the comk ir into the dr of sacb  did not affect degs-dependent positive regulation of sacb . this suggests that spacing between two half-sites would not be a critical factor for the promoter selectivity of degu.

discussion
this study demonstrated that while phosphorylation of degu stimulates its binding to the dr in the sacb promoter, it inhibits degu-binding to the artificial ir of the same promoter. these results strongly suggested that degu-p prefers binding to dr but not to ir . this hypothesis is consistent with the observation that phosphorylation of degu abolished its binding to br <dig> containing the ir-like sequence in the flgb promoter under the condition used. degu-p, however, could bind to the br <dig> in flgb and the degu <dig> mutation resulted in positive regulation of the f <dig> fusion through br <dig>  suggesting that degu-p could bind to this region when cellular concentrations of degu-p were high enough. we note that this positive regulation of the degu <dig> mutation was observed only in the swraa background. the possible binding of degu-p to the flgb promoter may be an exception to the hypothesis and remains to be elucidated.

notably, degu belongs to the narl response regulator family, which is characterized by a classical helix-turn-helix domain that recognizes irs of the same motifs  <cit> . however, narl has also been reported to bind to differently arranged motifs, namely, drs  <cit> . indeed, another report has shown that the narl-binding sites in various promoters are differently arranged as direct repeats, monomers, or inverted or divergent repeat  <cit> . it is quite possible that the binding to differently arranged motifs requires different protein-protein interactions within the putative dimers of degu, which might be regulated by phosphorylation. global analysis of the degu regulon has identified many genes other than the genes analyzed in this study  <cit> . it would be of interest to determine how the degu motif is arranged in the promoters of these genes as this may further enhance our understanding of degu regulation.

on the basis of the degu-binding sites we have identified, we propose that 5'-gncattta-3' is the consensus dna-binding sequence of degu and degu-p . supporting this is a previous study, which also proposed a putative degu consensus sequence on the basis of genetic analysis of the wapa promoter  <cit> : our newly proposed consensus is consistent with the important sequences for degu-binding to the wapa promoter. the degu-binding sequences that we identified are rather degenerate, and we speculate that this may be a common feature of the sequences recognized by other global regulators. therefore, it may be difficult to identify degu-binding sequences by inspecting of the upstream regions of degu-regulon genes. for example, there is degu-consensus-like sequences in the sacb promoter region , and the region appeared to be protected from dnase i cleavage to some extent. the mutational analysis, however, revealed that the sequences do not serve as a functional cis-element for degu-p . unknown features other than the primary sequence of the dna target may be involved in degu-p regulation.

we observed that his-tagged unphosphorylated degu bound to the promoter regions of apre and sacb   <cit> . this might mean that his-tagged unphosphorylated degu can bind to dr. this characteristic is different from that observed for intact unphosphorylated degu. it was reported that his-tagged spo0a was phosphorylated in e. coli, resulting in an isolation of spo0a-p without any phosphorylation reaction  <cit> . thus, it is possible that his-tagged degu purified from e. coli might undergo phosphorylation and serve as degu-p. the possibility is unlikely, however, because a half-life of degu-p has been reported to be less than  <dig> min due to an intrinsic phosphatase activity of degu  <cit> . it has been shown that the addition of the his-tag to the c-terminus of salmonella phop response regulator affects its biochemical properties and conformation with respect to its dimer formation and dna-binding ability  <cit> . addition of his-tag at the n-terminus of degu might alter its conformation as in the case of salmonella phop.

in our analysis of the mechanisms regulating flgb expression, we observed that swraa requires degu-binding to br <dig> to enhance flgb expression. while the exact function of swraa is not yet understood, it is known that swraa is required for swarming motility  <cit> , γ-poly-glutamic acid synthesis  <cit>  and enhancing of the transcription of the large fla/che operon in a non-laboratory strain  <cit> . the result that swraa stimulates the fla/che transcription in a degu-dependent manner led us to a speculation that swraa might facilitate degu-binding to its target promoter or modulate the degu function. we noted that if swraa functions to enhance the expression of some degu-dependent genes, it remains to be determined how swraa focuses specifically on its targets among the many genes that are regulated by degu.

amati et al. showed that the downstream region from the flgb transcription start site containing br <dig> did not interact with degu  <cit> . this result is inconsistent with our footprint data . we do not know the reason for this discrepancy. in addition, they claimed that degu-binding to the upstream region resulted in repression of ylxf, which is the ninth gene of the fla/che operon. our result clearly showed that the expression of the f <dig> fusion containing only br <dig> was increased in degu <dig> cells . the different interpretation between their results and ours might be due to the use of ylxf-lacz in their analysis. degu-p bound to br <dig> could be somehow dysfunctional in the presence of br <dig>  the regulatory mechanism involving the two brs remains to be solved, although we speculate that degu-p bound at each region might interact together through dna-looping, leading to the abolishment of the positive effect of degu-p through br <dig>  as a result, in the regulatory region carrying both regions, the degu <dig> mutation results in a decrease in flgb expression. this could be caused by a decrease in the cellular concentrations of unphosphorylated degu, but not in the repressor function of degu-p at br <dig>  as br <dig> did not serve as a functional cis-acting site in the absence of br <dig>  degu-p at br <dig> might rather work as an anti-activator.

we found that unphosphorylated degu is a positive regulatory factor of the flgb promoter, which is the first gene in the fla/che operon . it was reported that disruption of degu decreases the expression of sigd  <cit> , which is governed by the upstream flgb promoter  <cit> . our findings are consistent with this observation.

recently it has been reported that swarming motility and the flgb expression in the non-laboratory strain requires degs-independent low-level of degu-p  <cit> . these observations may be consistent with our findings, since unphosphorylated degu  may positively regulate the expression of the fla/che operon. to further characterize the degs-independent phosphorylation of degu, a study using a degu mutant lacking the phosphorylation site should be needed.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that degu positively regulates flgb and sacb via the brs containing the ir-like sequences and the dr present in their promoter regions, respectively . in, addition, we showed that degu-p prefers binding to dr but not to ir in the regulatory region of the sacb promoter.
