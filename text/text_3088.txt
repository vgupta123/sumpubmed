BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional modification of transfer and ribosomal rnas is essential for their cellular activities as core molecules of the translation apparatus. to date, the chemical structure of more than one hundred rna modifications have been identified in all domains of life  <cit> . in transfer rnas, modified nucleotides are found predominantly within the 3d-core of molecules and in the anticodon arm, especially at the wobble position  <dig> and at position  <dig>  3' adjacent to the anticodon . these particular modifications allow the molecules to adopt the canonical l-shaped conformation and modulate interactions with various interacting macromolecules such as aminoacyl:trna-synthetases, initiation, elongation and termination factors, mrna and/or elements of the decoding and peptidyl-centers of the ribosome . in ribosomal rnas, modified nucleotides are located mostly in regions corresponding to the functional centers of the ribosome  <cit> . their location suggests a role in accuracy and efficiency of translation, however the specific function of each modified nucleoside is still largely unknown. this lack of knowledge stems from peculiarities of the rrna molecule itself: it is a large molecule ; some nucleotides are only partially modified and their function are most certainly dependent on a network of synergistic interactions with different elements of the ribosome, including other modified nucleosides that may act cooperatively. nevertheless, function has been attributed to modified nucleosides in rrna in a few cases  <cit> .

difference in profile and type of rna modifications  is one of the criteria that distinguish the three kingdoms of life. while universal modifications such as Ψ, m5u, t6a or m1g are found in a large numbers of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryal trnas, each kingdom has a set of signature modifications. for examples mimg, g+, m22gm, ac6a or m1Ψ are typical of archaeal trnas, while yw, mcm5u and manq, or k2c, mo5u and m6t6a are typical of trnas from eukarya or bacteria respectively . the same conclusion applies for modified nucleotides in rrnas .

in archaea, our knowledge of the diversity of rna modifications is largely founded on the lifework of jim mccloskey and pamela crain, who analyzed bulk trna and rrna preparations from a phylogenetically diverse set of archaea. the technique used combined separation of nucleosides of bulk rna rnase hydrolysate by liquid chromatography, followed by comparison of the derived modified nucleosides to synthetic ones by mass spectrometry techniques  <cit>  . however, to date haloferax volcanii, a halobacteriaceae that lives optimally at 42°c in the presence of  <dig> – <dig>  m nacl  <cit> , is the only archaea for which both the chemical identities and positions of almost all modified ribonucleosides have been mapped for nearly the whole set of the  <dig> sequenced trnas with distinct anticodons  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> trna sequences of two closely related mesophilic halophiles are available, halobacterium cutirubrum  and halococcus morrhuae   <cit> . for h. volcanii ribosomal rnas, the type and position of modifications are available in the case of the 16s rna  <cit> , but not for the 23s nor the 5s rnas. these can be inferred from studies on another closely phylogenetically related halophilic archaea haloarcula marismortui  <cit> . however, while the rna modifications have been mapped in rnas of halophiles, including h. volcanii, the identity of the genes that code for the corresponding rna modification enzymes remains largely ignored.

using a comparative genomic analysis method, that we have recently applied to the only other organism with an almost complete set of sequenced trnas, the pathogenic bacteria mycoplasma capricolum  <cit> , we set out to predict all the rna modification genes in the halophilic archaeaon h. volcanii. some were easily predicted by homology with experimentally validated rna modification genes from other organisms, while a few are original predictions based on comparative genomic analysis  <cit>  . this computation work provides predictions that can now guide the experimental validation work with the goals of elucidating the role of rna modifications in archaeal translation, and ultimately obtaining a better understanding of the emergence of this extraordinary complex enzymatic machinery during evolution.

RESULTS
post-transcriptional modification of rna
modification pattern of trnas
thanks to the "tour de force" of gupta  <cit> , a list of almost all of the modified nucleosides present in the different trnas of haloferax volcanii, a typical mesophilic halophile, is available. figure 1a shows their distribution  in the general 2d-cloverleaf structure of trna, while figure 1b shows their positions in a schematic 3d-architecture model. the modifications that are unique to archaeal trnas are shown in gray. for example g+- <dig> , c*- <dig>  and m1Ψ- <dig> are unique to all archaeal trnas analyzed so far, both by their chemical structure and their positions in the nucleic acid, while others such as m22g- <dig>  Ψ- <dig>  Ψ- <dig>  cm- <dig> and m1i- <dig>  are unique only because of their position, rather than their chemical structure . since trna modification enzymes are usually site-specific, we expect the corresponding genes to be different from those in the other kingdoms. in terms of chemical structure , the modified nucleosides m22g, m5c and m1i found in trnas of h. volcanii are characteristic of eukaryal rather than eubacterial trnas, while d , i , m5u, i6a , q  and m7g, which are common in trnas of bacteria and eukarya, are absent in h. volcanii . also, as mentioned in the methods section, m1g at position  <dig> and m5c at positions 50– <dig> are found in trnas from another halophile, h. cutirubrum, but absent in these positions in all h. volcanii trnas.

the identification of a modified nucleotide does not imply it is present in a one to one ratio with the rna molecule. indeed, the presence and final chemical structure of certain modified nucleotides, particularly the hypermodified ones, may vary according to the physiological constraints of the cell . the a- <dig>  c- <dig>  u- <dig> and u- <dig> residues in some h. volcanii trnas were reported to be only partially modified into g+- <dig>  ac4c- <dig> , Ψ- <dig> or Ψ-54/m1Ψ- <dig> respectively, giving rise to distinct iso-trna species that sometimes can be separated by liquid chromatography or 2d-gel electrophoresis  <cit> . when a modification requires multiple modification enzymes like m1Ψ- <dig>  g+- <dig> and few u- <dig> derivatives , only intermediate products may exist under certain physiological conditions. however, the genes corresponding to all of the expected modified nucleotides  in the cellular trna population should be present in the genome.

modification pattern of rrna
in their early work, gupta and woese identified four positions with modified bases in h. volcanii 16s rna <cit> . these were later confirmed  <cit>  and identified as acp3u- <dig>  in hairpin  <dig> located in the 3' major domain, m6a- <dig>  in helix  <dig>  the tandem m62a- <dig> and m62a- <dig>  in hairpin  <dig> and a modified cytidine  of still unknown structure  at position  <dig>  in helix  <dig> in the 3' minor domain of ssu rna. their locations are shown in the schematic 2d-structure  and 3d-structure  of 16s rrna.

the characteristic pair of tandem dimethylated adenosine  is universally present at analogous positions in rrna of all organisms examined so far. these are located at the interface of the two ribosomal subunits  <cit>  and their formation may serve as a checkpoint in quality control of ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . likewise, acp3u- <dig>  in hairpin  <dig> appears to be nearly universally modified, although the type of base and corresponding modification vary from one organism to another: m2g 3'-adjacent to a m5c in 16s rna of both e. coli and thermotoga maritima  <cit> , m22g 3'-adjacent to m5c in thermus thermophilus  <cit> , m1Ψ-acp3u in drosophila melanogaster ssu rna and designated as unknown modified nucleoside in ssu rna of other organisms, mostly archaeons  <cit> . this modified nucleotide is above the p-site-bound trna and directly contacts the anticodon stem-loop of trna at position  <dig>  <cit> , and is also often modified . several studies indicate this nucleotide is important in decoding genetic information, particularly at the step of initiation  <cit> .

helix  <dig> is the dominant structural component of the 30s subunit interface. it's upper end lies just below where the mrna transverses the subunit in the p site  <cit> . this portion forms a significant intersubunit bridge while at the same time is directly functionally important for efficient and accurate decoding since two bases, at least in the e. coli ribosome  flip out of an internal loop in this region  <cit> . this allows the monitoring by direct contact of the mrna-trna base pairing in the a site, a conformational transition facilitated by the binding of aminoglycoside antibiotic, e.g. paromomycin, to a pocket in the major grove of the top of helix  <dig>  <cit> . modified nucleoside m6a- <dig>  at the bottom of helix  <dig> is present in ssu rna of most  archaea, and only a few eukarya, but never in bacteria . it is also termed a 'decoding site nt'  <cit>  because it is present in the functionally significant region of helix  <dig>  adjacent to a critical intersubunit bridge . contrary to the others above, the unknown n- <dig>  is found in archaea and in many bacteria, but not in eukarya. while it directly contacts paromomycin bound to helix  <dig>  its function remains an enigma and its chemical structure remains to be elucidated.

modification pattern of large subunit rrnas
no data are available for h. volcanii 23s rna modifications. we therefore used the analysis performed in the closely related organism haloarcula marismortui  <cit>  that led to the identification of modified nucleotides at eight positions. their locations in the generalized schematic 2d and 3d-stucture of 23s rrna are shown in figures 2c and 2d.

three Ψ residues are present: two of which, Ψ- <dig> and Ψ- <dig>  are located at universally conserved positions  in helix  <dig> loop of domain iv. the helix  <dig> stem-loop contacts a- and p-site trnas, contributes to bridge regions b2a and b2b of 23s rrna, is involved in translation termination, contacts ribosome recycling factor, plays an active role in dissociation of subunits at the end of translation, and is important for subunit association  <cit> . specifically, Ψ- <dig>  contacts the d stem of trna in the a site  and Ψ- <dig>  is immediately adjacent to bridge b2a contacts, as well as direct contacts to a-site trna; they are important for the conformational flexibility of helix  <dig> and their loss affects subunit association, dissociation, and translation termination  <cit> . the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit is the rrna that directly surrounds the active site of peptide bond formation and is made of the rrna of the central loop and proximal nucleotides of domain v, as well as the a-loop  and p-loop   <cit> . the third Ψ is conserved only in eukaryotes and is located at position  <dig>  between hairpin  <dig> and  <dig> in the central loop of domain v, immediately adjacent to rrna contacts with the p-site trna   <cit> .

three 2'-o-ribose methylations were also found: one gm is located at position  <dig>  in the structurally conserved helix  <dig> of domain iv contacting nucleotide  <dig> of the trna in the p site  <cit> , while the conserved tandem umgm, is located at positions 2587/ <dig>  in hairpin  <dig>  also called a-loop or peptidyltransferase loop of domain v, that contacts acceptor end of trna in the a-site of the ribosome. in the case of h. marismortui, mutagenesis studies  <cit>  and x-ray crystallography  <cit>  demonstrated the existence of base pairing between gm- <dig>  and c- <dig> of cca end of trna in the a-site of the ribosome, thus implicating a role in the peptidyl transfer reaction.

lastly, two base methylations  are present respectively at position  <dig>  in hairpin  <dig>  of domain ii and at position  <dig>  of domain v, between hairpins  <dig> and  <dig>  the importance of each of these two modified nucleotides  for maintenance of the archaeal ribosome architecture or translation is not known. however, since m3u-  <dig>  is in the central loop of domain v and immediately adjacent to rrna contacts with p-site trna <cit> , a fact revealed early on by affinity labeling results showing e. coli  <dig> adjacent the cca end of p-site rna  <cit> , this suggest a role in peptidyltransferase activity. moreover, the absence of the u-methylation in the homologous position in h. salinarium 23s rrna confers resistance to sparsomycin, and antibiotic that normally binds to the peptidyl transferase center  <cit> .

in domain v of 23s rna of h. salinarium, an additional Ψ- <dig>  at the bottom of helix  <dig>  not present in rrna of h. marismortui, has been reported  <cit> . however, as no homolog of the bacterial rluc-type, or the eukaryotic pus5p-type of enzymes responsible for the formation of this Ψ in the lsu rrna of respectively e. coli and s. cerevisiae can be found in the genome h. volcanii , its presence in the 23s rrna of h. volcanii is highly unlikely.

the case of 5s rrna
as no modifications were detected in the 5s rrna of the two halophilic archaea h. halobium and h. marismortui  <cit> , we predicted that h. volcanii would also lack modifications in this rrna. a 2'o-methylcytosine  at a conserved c-position  has been reported only in the 5s rrna of the thermophiles sulfolobus acidocaldarius  <cit>  and s. solfataricus  <cit> , while in the hyperthermophilic pyrodictium occultum the base at the same location  is further acetylated into ac4cm. both derivatives ac4c and ac4cm coexist, indicating incomplete modification of c- <dig> under the conditions the cells were grown before extraction of the rna  <cit> . the same is true for other modified nucleotides in the 16+ <dig> s rrnas.

a complete inventory of trna genes 
the genome of haloferax volcanii, strain d <dig>  comprises one chromosome  in several identical copies  and four smaller plasmids . all trna genes are located on the chromosome. this mesophilic halophile exhibits the typical archaeal trna set  <cit>  which is characterized by  <dig> distinct anticodons able to read all  <dig> sense codons . the extra g nucleotide at position  <dig> of tdna-his  is encoded in the genome but none of the cca 3' terminal sequence of tdnas are present. the list of tdna sequences in linear and cloverleaf forms is given in additional file  <dig>  remarkably the sequences of each mature trna  and corresponding tdnas as identified above perfectly match. the only sequences of mature trnas that are missing from gupta's analysis are those specific for trna-val , trna-ser , trna-thr , trna-gln , trna-arg  and trna-arg , all but one harboring a t <dig> wobble base in the corresponding trna gene. as stated in the original work  <cit> , the missing trnas probably correspond to minor isoacceptor species that co-migrated with one of the major species and therefore were impossible to isolate and sequence.

six trna genes are present in two copies, raising the total number of trna genes from  <dig> to  <dig>  among these six pairs, five are perfect duplicates , while the two tdna-gly  differ by the two base pairs 4– <dig> and 5– <dig>  as previously noted  <cit> . three of these trna pairs are organized in direct tandems with a short distance between the two genes:  <dig> × tdna-gly ,  <dig> nt;  <dig> × tdna-asp ,  <dig> nt;  <dig> × tdna-val ,  <dig> nt probably revealing a recent gene duplication. the two tdna-ala  are each embedded in the two copies of the ribosomal operon . other tdnas are randomly distributed throughout the genome; the next closest distance between two tdnas being  <dig> nt.

as only one gene exists for the majority of trnas harboring each a distinct anticodon, large differences must exist either in the expression levels of individual tdnas, or in the half-life of individual mature trnas . indeed the steady state concentrations within the cell of the major trnas  must be higher than those of minor trnas . the regulation of the expression of the different tdnas is yet to be elucidated in h. volcanii and in all other archaea . its is possible that trna stability depends on factors similar to those identified in yeast .

only three genes carry introns and in contrast with many other archaea , all are found at the canonical position 37/ <dig>  the three genes, tdna-met  , tdna-gln   and tdna-trp , display a nearly perfect hbhbh' motif  <cit>  with the so-called h helix being the anticodon stem and the so-called h' helix being 3-, 8- and 2-bp long, respectively . pre-trna-trp is unique as it contains the c/d and c'/d' boxes that allow methylation of 2' hydroxyl of the ribose at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the intron sequence  <cit>  – see also below).

as always in archaea and bacteria but not in eukarya  <cit> , three different tdnas bearing the  anticodon are present: the initiator tdna-met , the elongator tdna-met  and the tdna-ile . in this last case, the final identity of the mature functional trna-ile depends on post-transcriptional modification of c- <dig> into an as yet unknown modified c-derivative .

codon decoding strategy
the sequences of the  <dig> trnas harboring a distinct anticodon  are listed in figure  <dig> from the wobble base at position  <dig> to nucleotide- <dig> . this figure allows us to define the codon decoding strategy in a halophilic archaeon. it appears that: i) a systematic 'a- <dig> sparing' strategy is found, allowing the decoding of all pyrimidine ending codons  by one trna harboring a g <dig>  n'n' anticodon . the presence of g- <dig> in trna-arg  of the four codons decoding box is remarkable as the corresponding nucleoside is always an a- <dig>  in all eukarya and most bacteria  <cit> ; ii) no 'c- <dig> sparing' strategy is used, that would require a u34-containing trna to decode a codon ending with g- <dig>  while in the majority of bacteria such a situation is frequent . thus in h. volcanii, the only wobbling-type case of decoding during translation of the mrna is between a g34-containing trna and a codon ending with a u- <dig>  an acetyl group is present on n <dig> of c- <dig> in many c34-containing trnas, and many of these trnas seem to be only partially modified  <cit> . the presence of ac4c at the wobble position of trnas is unique to archaea, with the exception of the elongator trna-met  in e. coli  <cit> . however, the same modification has been found at position  <dig> in the d-arm of some trna-leu and trna-ser molecules of s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and in the 5s rrna of some thermophilic archaea . this modified nucleotide exhibits an exceptional conformational rigidity when embedded in an rna molecule  <cit> . its presence in the wobble position probably allows better binding of the trna to the cognate codon, possibly helps the trna to discriminate against codons ending with a  <cit>  and to aid in phase maintenance during translation; iii) the rare isoleucine aua codon is translated by a minor trna-ile, like in all bacteria. it harbors a unique type of modified cytidine able to discriminate against the met-aug codon. in e. coli, , this c- <dig> residue is always modified into lysidine ; while in archaea, the chemical structure of the modified cytosine- <dig> remains to be identified ; iv) due to lack of sequence information about many of the mature u34-containing trnas the identification of the chemical nature of the modified u  will require the discovery of potential u- <dig> modifying enzymes in the genome of h. volcanii  or additional analytical experiments; v) without exception, three isoacceptor trnas are always used to decode four synonymous codons in the four codons decoding boxes and two isoacceptor trnas for decoding the two purine-ending codons  in the split codon boxes. thus altogether  <dig> elongator trna and one additional initiator trna-met are required to decode the  <dig> sense codons in h. volcanii. from the early work of bayley and griffiths  <cit> , it is known that accuracy of translation of synthetic homopolymers by extracts of the extreme halophilic bacterium h. cutirubrum, and probably all halophiles, requires the presence of very high salt concentration .

genes coding for transfer rna modification enzymes 
biochemical analysis using as substrate t7-transcripts of trna genes lacking all the modified nucleosides, allows enzymatic activities for producing pseudouridine and several base-methylated derivatives in trna, such as m1a- <dig>  m1i- <dig>  cm- <dig>  m1Ψ- <dig>  m5c- <dig> and m22g- <dig> to be demonstrated in cell-free extracts of h. volcanii  <cit> , but none of the corresponding genes were identified. only recently were the genes coding for the multiprotein complex that use guide rna to methylate the 2'-hydroxyl of cytosine- <dig> and uridine- <dig> in h. volcanii trna-trp characterized  <cit> . in other archaeal species , genes coding for several trna modification enzymes have been not only identified, but also experimentally validated. these were used to easily predict the h. volcanii orthologs with good confidence . these include the enzymes that introduce the m2g/m22g- <dig>  m1g- <dig>  and m1a- <dig> modifications . a protein homologous to the key enzyme transglycosyltransferase  responsible for the insertion of the g+ precursor preq <dig> in m. jannaschii trna  <cit>  is also found in h. volcanii. the genes involved the synthesis of preq <dig> and in the conversion of preq <dig> to g+ after its insertion in trna, are not known in any archaeal organisms to date. they are currently being identified in our laboratory at the university of florida in gainesville and will be described elsewhere. another set of trna modification enzymes that introduce the Ψ- <dig>  m2g/m22g- <dig> and t6a- <dig> modifications respectively can be predicted by homology with yeast and/or e. coli experimentally validated orthologs . for the  <dig> remaining modifications, the prediction process is less straightforward because the homology scores with the experimentally validated yeast or bacterial homologs are too low, paralog families complicate the analysis or the corresponding gene has not been identified in any species. these are discussed separately below.

cm/um residues
in h. volcanii trna, 2'-o-methylation of ribose occurs in four positions,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . as stated above, cm- <dig> and um- <dig> in the anticodon branch of trna-trp are formed by the guide rna machinery that includes the fibrillarin enzyme  and accessory proteins nop56/ <dig> and l7ae  <cit> , all encoded in the genome of h. volcanii . the rna antisense bearing the c/d and c'/d' boxes is part of the pre-trna sequence and includes the long intron of  <dig> nt, a situation that exists also in pre-trna-trp from at least  <dig> archaea   <cit> . the mechanism by which the 'intronic' antisense sequence acts in vivo in cis to 'self' induce the 2'-o-methylations of c- <dig> and u- <dig> in pre-trna-trp, or in trans by acting on an other molecule of pre-trna-trp, is still an open question. however in vitro experiments favor a trans-acting box c/d snrna guided mechanism  <cit> . in the case of intron-containing trna-met, cm- <dig> is also guided by a srna  but here the c/d antisense rna is not intronic but exonic as described for the c/d box srna sr <dig>  which was predicted to guide the modification of cm- <dig> in the trna-met of pyrococcus  <cit> . we identified  <dig> srna candidates to guide the modification of cm- <dig>  we found a candidate in the genome of h. walsbyi for which no trna-met containing an intron could be identified in the genomic sequence available at ncbi. thanks to the target region, we also identified the trna-met containing the intron. our analysis reveals that srna guiding formation of 2'-o-methyl ribose at position  <dig> and  <dig> in pre-trna-trp is always intronic, while the formation of the same cm- <dig> in pre- trna-met is always exonic. in both cases, part of the intron sequence is involved in base pairing with srna, thus 2'-o-methylation at ribose in position  <dig> and  <dig> in pre-trna-trp and in position  <dig> in pre-trna-met have to occur before intron splicing  <cit> .

remarkably, halobacteria show more degenerated c, c', d and d' boxes and a longer region between d' and c' boxes  than other orders . in contrast, the insertion of cm- <dig> found in the anticodon loop of four trnas  and of cm- <dig> found in all h. volcanii trnas , is almost certainly catalyzed by non rna guided enzymes. indeed, a solid homolog of the trmh  protein that has been found to catalyze the formation of xm- <dig> in e. coli  <cit> , is present in the genome of h. volcanii . it is the only member of the spou family  <cit>  found in this organism. for cm- <dig> in the Ψ-loop, a strong homolog of the p. abyssi protein found to catalyze this reaction in vitro , can be identified in the genome of h. volcanii .

Ψ residues
apart from Ψ- <dig> which is most certainly modified by the trud ortholog , seven other Ψ residues? are present in h. volcanii trna at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . Ψ- <dig> is a universal modification inserted in yeast by pus4p  <cit>  and in e. coli by trub  <cit> , both belonging to the same cog <dig>  the only homolog of these two proteins that can be identified in the h. volcanii genome is cbf5p, which is the catalytic subunit of the guide machinery . however, recent work from different laboratories have shown that in vitro, cbf5p can modify u- <dig> in trna, as well as in rrna, in a guide-independent fashion, the enzymatic reaction being stimulated by the presence of nop10p  <cit> . psu10p from p. furiosus, that is not part of the trub/cbf5p family of proteins  but is instead a member of the cog <dig> family , can also introduce the Ψ- <dig> modification in archaeal trnas in vitro. this observation has been validated by complementation experiment using an e. coli trub mutant  <cit> . it is however still not clear which of the two enzymes  is responsible for the formation of Ψ- <dig>  in archaeal trnas in vivo. as discussed in  <cit> , the possibility exists that each of the two Ψ- <dig> forming enzymatic systems act on distinct sets of trnas. it is worthy of mention that no psu10p homolog is found in n. equitans, whereas a genes coding for cbf5p and nop <dig> homologs are detected . unfortunately, no evidence for the presence or absence of Ψ- <dig> in any of the trnas, or of Ψ in rrna is available for this organism.

other quasi universal Ψ. modifications are Ψ-38/ <dig> of the anticodon branch inserted in yeast by pus3p  <cit>  and in e. coli by trua  <cit> , both members of the cog <dig> family. only one protein of this family could be identified in h. volcanii . its homology with both the e. coli and the yeast gog <dig> members is quite low but multiple sequence alignments using clustalw  <cit>  confirmed that the critical trua specific active site consensus sequence   <cit>  is conserved in the haloferax protein. no homologs of yeast pusp 1-  <dig>  <cit>  or e. coli truabcd  could be identified in the h. volcanii genome, leaving Ψ 's at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with no corresponding candidate pseudouridine synthase. the corresponding uridines are located in helical regions , thus perhaps relatively inaccessible to the enzyme, and these are isomerized to Ψ only in one trna species, whereas the other Ψ modifications, at least those in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are located in loops and found in several trnas . this led us to suppose they may be introduced at a very early stage of the trna biosynthesis, possibly still during transcription and when the cloverleaf structure of the nascent pre-trna is not yet formed, potentially by the rna-guided machinery including cbf5p, nop10p, gar1p and l7ae homologs . however no h/aca snrna could be identified in h. volcanii. this could be due to a high divergence of h/aca rna structures in h. volcanii or, as discussed above in the case of Ψ- <dig> formation, to a guide rna independent pseudouridylation by the cbf5p/nop10p dependent machinery acting during transcription on an as yet unfinished trna molecule composed of stems and loops. one cannot however rule out that an as yet unidentified pseudouridine synthase family is present in this organism.

m5c residues
four positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are modified to m5c in h. volcanii. in yeast, trm4p is not site-specific and introduces this modification at several positions in trna molecules  <cit> . members of this huge family of proteins  are however difficult to annotate by sequence alone as some also modify rrna  <cit> . recently one of the five cog <dig> members from p. abyssi  was found to catalyze in vitro the formation of m5c at several positions in trna, including positions  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . h. volcanii has just one member of this family  that is highly similar to pab <dig>  and ribosomal rna of this organism does not contain any m5c . hence, it is highly probable that hvo_ <dig> is the only rna:m5c methyltransferase that modifies the four cytosines found in the sequenced trnas of h. volcanii . the presence of additional m5c residues at positions 50– <dig> in some trnas of h. cutirubrum probably also result from the action in this organism of a unique multi-site specific trna:m5c methyltransferase.

i <dig> and m1i57
in h. volcanii, the only inosine  residue is found at position  <dig> of the majority of trnas . enzymatic formation of the doubly modified m1i occurs in two strictly sequential steps. the first step is the methylation of a- <dig> catalyzed by the trna:m1a methyltransferase of the p. abyssi trmi family  . then deamination of m1a- <dig> occurs by a trna:m1a-specific deaminase  <cit> , that is different from other trna deaminases such as tad1p and tad2p/tad3p catalyzing the formation of inosine from adenosine in position  <dig> and  <dig> respectively in s. cerevisiae trnas  <cit>  or tada catalyzing the site-specific formation of inosine- <dig> exclusively in trna-arg  <cit> , as we could not identify any homologs of these families in the h. volcanii genome. we searched for protein families specifically conserved in all archaea but absent in eukarya, with rna binding domains. one candidate is the cog <dig> family. it is annotated as an rna-binding protein as the structure of the a. fulgidus family member  showed that the n-terminal domain is similar to many nucleic acid binding protein with the presence of a characteristic s <dig> domain  <cit> . analysis of a clustalw sequence alignment reveals a highly conserved histidine residue in a motif  h l   that is similar to the adenosine deaminase "motif i" found in all adenosine deaminases  <cit> .

m <dig> Ψ
the methylation at position  <dig> is a hallmark of archaea, except in thermococcales where m5u <dig> is found  <cit> . cog <dig> proteins that are part of spout superfamily have been predicted as candidates for this missing methylase  <cit>  and genes of this family do indeed cluster with psu10p in several genomes . however, it is present in organisms that are expected to have m5u and not m1Ψ at this position such as the pyrococci  <cit> . experimental validation is required to ascertain the function of this putative Ψ-dependent methyltransferase .

modified uridine- <dig> derivatives
as a rule u34-harboring trnas belonging to the split codon boxes corresponding to leu , gln , lys , glu  and arg  need to discriminate for the nn-purine codons and not miscode for the nn-pyrimidine codons. only certain types of modified u- <dig> can perform this task  <cit> . in contrast, trnas bearing unmodified u- <dig> are able to decode codons ending with purines and pyrimidines, such as those found in the four codon decoding boxes as in mycoplasma for example  <cit> . as expected a modified u!  was identified in naturally occurring trnas of h. volcanii specific for lys  and glu   <cit> . however for trna-leu  and trna-arg , the identity of u- <dig> is yet to be determined as these trnas remain to be sequenced . curiously, u- <dig> of h. volcanii trna-leu  was reported not to be modified, while the u- <dig> residue in trna-leu , trna-arg  and trna-gly  belonging to the four codons boxes appears to be . unexpectedly, u- <dig> in trna-pro  and trna-ala  is not modified  <cit> , while the corresponding four codons decoding boxes contains two other trnas  able to decode the other codons, except the one ending with a . thus the pattern of modified/unmodified u- <dig> in h. volcanii trnas is non-canonical and the exact chemical nature of the u! in the different trnas of h. volcanii remains an enigma [as well as in the few other archaeal trnas sequenced so far  <cit> .

in the case of trnas specific for gln, lys and glu in h. volcanii, a thiolated u- <dig> derivative should exist, as for their bacterial and eukaryal counterparts . indeed, in the genome of h. volcanii, a gene homolog to eukaryal tuc <dig> belonging to cog <dig> is found. in s. cerevisiae, this tuc <dig> protein has recently been shown to be involved in the formation of s2u- <dig> in yeast cytoplasmic trnas  <cit> . also, clustering of tuc <dig> with iscs and iscu, the two proteins required for donating the thio compound  strengthens the prediction that this family of proteins do participate in the formation of thiolated compounds. however, analysis of the h. volcanii genome suggests that ?u <dig> in trnas, as in many other archaeal trnas, is more complex than just a s2u. indeed, homologs of the yeast trm9p methylase and of the radical sam enzyme elp <dig> are also found in h. volcanii genome . trm9p is the yeast mcm5u/mcm5s2u trna carboxyl methyltransferases  <cit>  and elp <dig> is in yeast part of the elongation complex comprised of  <dig> proteins elp1- <dig> that have all been shown to have a role in the formation of mcm5u  <cit> . in vivo the pleiotropic effect of mutations in the yeast elp genes appear to be due to the absence of the modified base in trna  <cit> . however, out of the six eukaryal elp proteins only homologs of elp <dig> can be found in archaea. this protein is part of the radical sam family  <cit> . in s. solfataricus, the elp <dig> and trm9p encoding genes are also clustered . tuc <dig> is present in all sequenced genomes of archaea, elp <dig> is lacking only in n. equitans, and trm9p homologs are found only in a limited subset of archaea . taken together, the data suggest that the type of u- <dig> modification in h. volcanii trnas belonging to two codon split decoding boxes is similar but not identical to the mcm5s2u derivative found in eukaryal trnas.

gupta proposed that mo5u- <dig> may exist in h. volcanii trnas <cit> . in bacteria it has been shown that chorismic acid is a precursor to mo5u- <dig> formation through the ho5u intermediate, with the product of cmob catalyzing the conversion of ho5u- <dig> to mo5u- <dig>  <cit> . cmob protein is part of the methyltransferases type  <dig> family  that is difficult to annotate because it is so widespread. a distant homolog of cmob was indeed identified  and could be the potential mo5u synthase but this prediction is not very robust and absolutely requires experimental validation. the genes that are responsible for the formation of ho5u have not been identified in any organism.

ac4c-34
is found only at position  <dig> in many h. volcanii trnas. in certain archaea and eukaryotes it has also been detected in ribosomal rna . the only known enzyme involved in ac4c formation is yeast tan <dig>  that does not have any homolog in h. volcanii. however it was predicted that tan <dig> binds trna and carries the recognition determinants but must function in complex with yet unidentified acetylation enzymes  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . one enzyme family cog <dig>  that contains an atpase domain fused to an acetyltransferase domain was identified as a potential candidate. genes of this family cluster with translation genes . in yeast, the homolog  is essential  <cit> , whereas the e. coli ypfi homolog is not  <cit> , and has recently been shown to be responsible for ac4c formation in trna initiator in e. coli  <cit> .

lysidine/k2c <dig> homolog
finally, like bacteria, all archaea but n. equitans have a minor trna-ile   <cit> . this requires the modification of c- <dig> to a c*. otherwise this trna-ile would be charged erroneously with methionine  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . in all bacteria except in mycoplasma mobile  <cit> , a lysinyl group is inserted by the atp-dependent tils family of enzymes  <cit> , but in archaea the structure of c- <dig> modification is still not known, and no tils gene has been found in h. volcanii. potential candidates for a gene coding for an enzyme catalyzing the selective modification of c- <dig> in trna-ile  should be found in all archaea but n. equitans and should also be absent in the genomes of e. coli and s. cerevisiae. using the orthomcl phylogenetic distribution search tool  <cit> , we identified  <dig> protein families that conform to the above criteria. we favor two candidates in this list for missing c*-synthase genes: i) the nucleic acid binding protein-ob fold family  that contains a potential rna binding domain, and ii) the cog <dig> family, annotated as an atp-grasp superfamily. both these families cluster with trna modification genes in several archaea  and follow the expected phylogenetic distribution .

genes coding for ribosomal rna modification enzymes
very few archaeal enzymes involved in the modification of ribosomal rna have been experimentally characterized to date with the exception of the guide rrna methylation and peudouridylation machinery enzymes . however thus far little investigation has been performed in the case of halophilic organisms, including h. volcanii. the analysis below  is hence mainly based on comparative genomics predictions that await experimental validations.

m62a
among modification enzymes acting on rrna that can be easily identified in h. volcanii by sequence homology is the archaeal member of the rsma/dim1p family. this enzyme introduces four methyl groups in the conserved tandem adenosine in hairpin  <dig> of the 16s rna to form m62a m62a . the function of the m. jannaschii rsma ortholog was experimentally confirmed  <cit> . a strong homolog of this enzyme is found in h. volcanii .

2'-o-methylated derivatives
likewise, a homolog of rrmj  that catalyzes the formation of the quasi universally conserved um at position  <dig> of the hairpin  <dig> of bacterial 23s rna  <cit>  in e. coli  is also found in h. volcanii . in s. cerevisiae a site-specific mrm <dig> enzyme introduces the same modification in the mitochondrial 21s   <cit>  but a guide rna  machinery is responsible for the equivalent cytoplasmic yeast 28s rrna methylation   <cit> . in this later case, spb1p  can also catalyze the formation of um- <dig>  even if its normal function is to catalyze the 2'-o-methylation of adjacent g- <dig>  <cit> . since the snrnp-dependent formation of um- <dig> occurs within the nucleus at an early step of the rrna maturation process, and the action of spb <dig> enzyme proceed later within the cytoplasm, only if u- <dig> has not previously been fully modified in the nucleus, can spb1p then complete the reaction  <cit> . in the case of u- <dig>  and/or g- <dig>  methylation in 23s rna of h. volcanii, searches for potential guide rna have been unsuccessful by using both pattern matching approaches and the dedicated snoscan software, while in p. abyssi, a sr <dig> c/d box srna was predicted to guide the methylation of u- <dig>   <cit> . failure to detect the guide in the halophiles might be due to a divergent structure of the snrnas in these organisms or could reflect the real absence of such guide rnas for these particular methylation targets. the possibility exists that the halophilic rlme homolog, identified above, is a multi-site specific enzyme and catalyzes both the formation of um- <dig> and gm- <dig>  a precedent for such a situation is found in the enzymatic formation of m1a at both positions  <dig> and  <dig> of trna by the pyrococcale trmi enzyme  <cit> , while the bacterial and eukaryal homologs  are strictly site-specific and methylate only a- <dig> in trnas  <cit> . another possibility is that halophiles have multiple paralog copies  of cog <dig> family that contain the rna binding tram   <cit>  and one of these enzymes could be responsible for the formation of um- <dig> 

we found at least one c/d box srna candidate to guide the 2'o-methylation of the ribose at position g- <dig> . homologous sequences were found in  <dig> archaeal genomes . moreover, our results suggest that in pyrococcus, the sr <dig> orphan c/d box srna  could modify the equivalent of g- <dig> position.

pseudouridines
no homologs of the multiple known e. coli pseudouridine synthases that modify rrna  could be identified in h. volcanii. as demonstrated for rrna of eukarya and some archaea, such as s. solfataricus, a. fulgidus or p. furiosus and p. abyssi, Ψ residues could also be introduced by the guide rna machinery and indeed, all the enzymes needed are presents in the h. volcanii genome . in eukaryotes, the equivalent of Ψ- <dig> and Ψ- <dig> are modified by the same h/aca srna, respectively u <dig> in human and snr <dig> in yeast. in archaea the equivalent of Ψ  <dig> was proposed to be modified in pyrococcales and a. fulgidus respectively by pf <dig> in p. furiosus and afu <dig> in a. fulgidus  <cit> . recently a combination of in silico and experimental work identified seven h/aca involved in pseudouridylation of rrna in p. abyssi while a total of  <dig> Ψ residues were detected  <cit> . some of these srna modify several positions in rrna but clearly not all the  <dig> Ψ residues are accounted for, and for certain positions  the modification can be introduced in vitro by the cbf5p/nop10p dependent complex in the absence of any guide rna  <cit> . indeed Ψ- <dig>  was introduce by the pf <dig> homolog  and the afu- <dig> h/aca srna in vitro but the modification equivalent to Ψ- <dig> was not  <cit> . pf <dig> contains three hairpin motifs, namely pf7-stem-i, pf7-stem-ii and pf7-stem-iii, each one able to guide a modification. the in silico approach used in the present analysis allowed to identify two h/aca srna hairpins, respectively hp <dig> and hp <dig>  candidate to the modifications of Ψ- <dig>  Ψ- <dig> and Ψ- <dig>  we did not find the homolog of pf7-stemi hairpin, which is consistent with the absence of a fourth modification in h. marismortuii. hp <dig> is clearly the homolog of pf7-stemiii and hp <dig> appear to be the homolog of pf7-stemii. remarkably in h. volcanii and other halobacteria, both hairpins are conserved but are separated by a long spacer whereas they are adjacent in thermococcales. hp <dig> would be able to guide Ψ  <dig> and Ψ  <dig> by forming alternative structures around the position to modify  while the hp <dig> could target Ψ- <dig> . remarkably in p. abyssi, this last modification was not found experimentally  <cit>  whereas pab <dig> could adopt an alternative structure able to target this position . finally we did not find the homolog of pf7-i and pf7-ii in the crenarchaeote ignococcus hospitalis. certainly, the modification targeted is not present.

m1a
this methylated adenosine is located in hairpin  <dig>   of domain ii . a weak homologs of rlma that introduces a m1g in the e. coli large subunit in position  <dig>  <cit>  can be identified  and is a possible candidate for the formation of m1a, even if it is a different purine base. indeed, during evolution, an enzyme able to methylated n <dig> in guanosine might have adapted to methylation of n <dig> in adenosine, exactly as an ancient c5-methylated enzyme has derived to become a c5-methyltransferase of uridine by simply changing few aminoacids in the active site in order to accommodate u instead of c  <cit> .

m3u
this n <dig> methylated uridine  is located between hairpins  <dig> and  <dig> . a good candidate for the missing m3u inserting enzyme in h. volcanii is the protein belonging to cog <dig> . indeed, analyzing the spout family enzymes, bujnicki and coll.  <cit>  found that cog <dig>  exemplified by e. coli rsme that introduces the m3u modification in 16s rna  <cit> , has a complementary phylogenetic distribution to the cog  <dig> family found in archaea and eukaryotes. moreover, genes encoding cog <dig> proteins are inserted in operons encoding for ribosomal proteins in phylogenetically diverse archaea such as the pyrococci, archeoglobus fulgidus and h. salinarium .

m6a
this methylated exocyclic nh <dig> of adenosine is located at position  <dig>  of 16s rna in helix  <dig> in the 3' minor domain . compilation of modification data in the ssu rna modification database  <cit>  shows that the m6a modification found in the h. volcanii 16s rna can also be found at the same position in s. solfataricus and in three eukaryotes homo sapiens, xenopus laevis and rattus norvegicus. by searching for genes that are present in these four organisms  we identified the cog <dig> family. annotated as rna methyltransferase or n6-dna-methylase, members of this family are present in most archaea and many eukaryotes. the structure of the cog <dig> member ph <dig> was determined in complex with s-adomet  <cit>  and revealed that this protein was a structural homolog of ermc'  that confers resistance to macrolides by introducing an n6-methylation at adenine  <dig>  of 23s rrna  <cit> . we propose that the h. volcanii cog <dig> member  is also involved in m6a formation but in the 16s rna, not the 23s rna.

acp3u
this uridine bearing a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group on n <dig> of uridine is located at position  <dig>  of hairpin  <dig> in 3'major domain of 16s rna . it is modified to m1acp3Ψ. in all eukaryotes analyzed so far but is never present in small rna subunits of bacteria that always have a non modified g  in this position  <cit> . using the phylogenetic pattern tool of the orthomcl database  <cit>  we searched for genes that are conserved in mammals, s. cerevisiae and all archaea but absent in all bacteria. a large collection of genes follow this pattern , most of them are ribosomal proteins and other translation related genes. one candidate stood out as a potential acp3u inserting enzyme, the cog <dig> family. proteins of this family are found in all sequenced archaea and eukaryotes and contain a c-terminal pua domain  that is often involved in rna binding  <cit> . the yeast member of the cog <dig> family, yer007c-a, has been shown to associate with ribosomes and a null mutant has clear translation defects  <cit> .

beside the putative genes identified above, a few other genes corresponding to as yet unidentified modified nucleotides need to be discovered, such as for the currently unidentified c* derivative located at position  <dig> in hairpin  <dig> in the 3' minor domain ssu rna . n- <dig> is also found at the same position in the bacteria thermotoga maritima  <cit> . lastly, while the possibility is meager, one or two additional modified nucleotides might still exist in rrnas of h. volcanii. indeed, the full lengths of the 16s and 23s  of h. volcanii or of h. marismortui have not been explored, only the most critical regions where the probability was high to discover conserved or semi-conserved nucleotides have been investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
the archaeaon haloferax volcanii has the particularity of being a 'salt-loving' prokaryote that lives in the mildly hot and hypersaline environment of the dead sea  where it was first isolated  <cit> . life at such high salt concentrations is energetically costly. indeed, to insure the osmotic balance between the cytosol and the high salt environment in which they thrive, halophiles have to accumulate and maintain high concentrations of solutes. these are mainly inorganic ions, such as kcl that can reach molar concentrations or mg2+, but various organic osmotic solutes such as glycerol, trehalose and/or glycine betaine are also used  <cit> . as there are no visible compartments in the haloferax cell  <cit> , this lifestyle requires the adaptation of the entire intracellular enzymatic machinery, including rna maturation and mrna translation processes. indeed, at high salt concentrations, the high molecular weight rrna and the majority of proteins from non halophilic prokaryotes simply precipitate .

here we combine the identification of the whole set of functional trnas, including the presence of modified nucleosides , with the identification of most of the corresponding rna modification enzymes  in h. volcanii. this analysis allows to address: i) the peculiarities of the decoding strategies used by h. volcanii to read the  <dig>  sense codons of mrnas; and ii) to emphasize the relative low number of modifications in halophilic t+rrnas. this work is a logical continuation of a similar trnomics analysis of fully sequenced genomes from the three kingdoms of life  <cit> , later extended to the modomics analysis of mollicutes, a family of parasites that underwent a drastic reduction of their genomes during evolution  <cit> . on an evolution point of view, halobacteriales like the euryarchaeon h. volcanii, and other distantly related organisms able to grow at salt concentrations above  <dig> g/l , such as certain methanosarcinales , flavobacteria, cyanobacteria and proteobacteria  or a few flagellated, ciliates and fungi , are all located on a relatively 'recent' branches of the small subunit rrna based phylogenetic tree . thus, emergence of halophilic organisms likely results from an adaptive-type of cellular evolution from a non-halophilic ancestor arising independently several times during the evolution of the three domains of life.

the detailed mechanism by which mrnas are accurately decoded without slippage by the ribosome in an extremely halophiles is largely ignored. the only published study using cell-free system from halobacterium cutirubrum shows that incorporation of radiolabeled amino-acids into polypeptides under the direction of synthetic polyribonucleotides, follows the same decoding rules found in non halophilic organisms, but that the accuracy of amino acids incorporation was dependent on the presence of various salts at high concentrations . this lead to the conclusion that the codon recognition processes are only secondarily dependent on ionic interactions and that the effect of salts was probably to enable all the macromolecular components to assume their correct secondary and tertiary configuration, a conclusion that is evident nowadays.

what is clear from the present work, is that the  <dig>  trnas found in h. volcanii that read the  <dig> universally used sense codons  are typical of the archaea that have been analyzed to date with a few minor differences discussed above . what is more interesting is that h. volcanii uses only  <dig> different types of modified nucleotides at  <dig> positions in the  <dig> mature trna isoacceptors, while both e. coli and s. cerevisiae use at least  <dig> different types of modified nucleotides at  <dig> and  <dig> different positions respectively  <cit> . as far as the type and position of modified nucleoside in trnas, the archaeon h. volcanii resembles eukarya in some ways and eubacteria in others . the cases where an identical modification is found at the same position in the three kingdoms are rare . the modifications that are archaeal specific by their chemical structure and/or their positions in trnas are also not numerous . examples include g+- <dig>  ac4c- <dig>  m1Ψ- <dig>  cm- <dig> and m1i- <dig> . phylogenetic and structural analysis of the transglycosylase tgt catalyzing the incorporation of precursor of archaeosine  into trna, points to a common evolutionary origin with the present-day enzyme catalyzing the formation of queuosine at position  <dig> in many bacteria and higher eukaryotes  <cit> , a typical case of divergent evolution. in contrast, the enzymatic formation of m1i at position  <dig> in archaeal trna involves a totally different set of enzymes than those needed to catalyze the formation of the same modification at position  <dig> in eukaryal trna-ala  <cit> , this time a case of convergent evolution. our analysis has raised several questions that await experimental follow-up. several predictions such as those for the genes involved in m1i or ac4c formation need to be validated. the nature of s2u- <dig> derivative that was predicted from the comparative genomic analysis but was not found in the initial trna sequencing work  <cit>  has to be identified. we failed to find any gene coding for putative  site-specific rna pseudouridine synthase, nor for 'classical' box h/aca guide rnas with that catalyze the formation of pseudouridines at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as point out above, it might well be that these Ψ 's are formed at very early step of the trna maturation  by the non rna guide cbf5p/nop10p/gar <dig> complex.

for h. volcanii and yeast mitochondria  all modifications are listed whereas for e. coli, m. capricolum and yeast cytoplasm those that are relevant for the comparison are indicated ; modifications present in a,b,e are in bold; modification that appear specific to h. volcanii  are in underlined bold and.

the type and location of modified nucleotides found in 16s rrna of h. volcanii and in the 23s rrna of the closely phylogenetically related h. marismortui were compared to those found in e. coli and s. cerevisiae . there again the surprising feature in halophiles is the paucity of rrna modifications with only  <dig> different modified nucleotides in  <dig> positions in the 16s rrna  and  <dig> in  <dig> positions in the 23s rrna . in e. coli there are  <dig> different types of modified nucleotides within  <dig> positions of the 16+23s rrnas and in s. cerevisiae 18+23+5s rrnas contain at least  <dig> different modified nucleotides located at more than  <dig> positions  <cit> . only a few of these modifications are found in all the three biological domains in rrna analyzed to date from . without exception, they are located in critical functional domains of the rna molecules, e.g. in the decoding center of the ssu rrna  and near the peptidyl transferase center of lsu rrna  manifesting their functional importance in various aspects of the dynamic process or mrna translation . their importance is further supported by the fact that the genes coding for the corresponding enzymes, as well as the srna guided modification machinery allowing the formation of these conserved t+rrna modifications, are also remarkably conserved among the different domains of life, except for gm- <dig>  m1a- <dig> and acp3u- <dig> that are present in eukaryotic rrna and absent in bacterial rrna .

here, the numbering of the specific organisms is given; modifications present in a,b,e are in bold; modification that appear specific to h. volcanii/h. marismortui  are in underlined bold; for m. capricolum the presence of the modification has been predicted from the presence of the corresponding gene  <cit>  ; for h. volcanii and yeast mitochondria  all modifications are listed whereas for e. coli, m. capricolum and yeast cytoplasm those that are relevant for the comparison are indicated, however, in few cases, is listed a given modification in e. coli or yeast rrna that has no equivalent in h. volcanii but is present in the vicinity of a modified nucleotides found h. volcanii.

a clear positive correlation has been observed between the total number of ribose methylation sites, the eventual corresponding number of methylation guide srnas and the optimal temperature at which an organism is growing, suggesting an important role of this type of modification in rna stabilization . clearly as the number of 2'- o-methyl ribose is exceptionally low in rrna of halophiles, the rules guiding the faithful maturation of rrna molecule, as well as the stabilization of their quaternary structure within the ribosome, might differ from other archaea . of note also is the absence of polyamines in extreme halophiles, as the slight amount of polyamines that can be detected actually originate from the culture medium . polyamines, like mg2+ and other ions stabilize nucleic acids  and also facilitate protein synthesis  <cit> . the 3d structure of the large 50s subunit of h. marismortui has been solved to  <dig>  angstrom resolution  <cit> . analysis of the structure reveals a great number of monovalent and divalent ions as well as water molecules that are critical for the formation and stabilization of that rrna structure. hence, we propose that the presence of high concentration of salts  in the cytosol of h. volcanii has allowed the elimination of numerous rrna and trna modifications as well as of polyamines biosynthesis, whose 'global' functions are to allow faithful maturation of pre-t+rrnas and/or to stabilize the mature t+rrnas and their association with other proteins . if the functional replacement of many rna modification by salts had indeed occurred, then modified nucleotides remaining in t+rrna of halophilic organism must serve purposes other than stabilization of rna architecture, such as decoding, accuracy of translation or other functions that cannot be functionally replaced by the electrostatic interactions provided by the surrounding salts. this hypothesis is corroborated with the fact that most, if not all of the modified nucleoside found in h. volcanii/h. marismortui rrna are among the most evolutionary conserved modified nucleosides along organisms of the three biological domains . they are also among those we have pointed out as being the most refractory to reductive evolution in mycoplasma  <cit> . this would suggest that the modifications remaining in h. volcanii trna are also critical for functions that cannot be replaced by salt and we are currently mutating all the corresponding genes to address the functional of these modifications in vivo.

this trnomics and modomics analysis of h. volcanii reinforces the necessity to integrate the knowledge of both t+rrna sequences and modifications in order to understand the decoding properties of a given organisms. for most organisms this information can be derived only from comparative genomic analysis as sequence information of mature rnas are lacking. however, to predict the presence or absence of modified nucleotides just from the analysis of the encoded genes is still quite dangerous and requires the type of systematic analysis performed here as a foundation in order to analyze other archaeal genomes and understand of the function of rna modification in archaeal translation and its evolutionary importance.
