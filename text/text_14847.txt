BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small endogenous non-coding rnas that regulate expression at the post-transcriptional level in animals and plants  <cit> . both plant and animal mirnas are cleaved from one arm of foldback precursors . it is generally accepted that pre-mirna secondary and/or tertiary structures are critical in mirna biogenesis  <cit> . the thermodynamic stability of pre-mirna hairpin secondary structures, hereafter called pre-mirna stability, is a fundamental property of rna structure and has been systematically studied. bonnet et al. reported that in five animal species and one plant species pre-mirnas have significantly lower estimated folding minimum free energies  than those of their shuffled sequences, unlike other kinds of rnas such as trnas, rrnas  <cit> , and mrnas  <cit> . zhang et al. directly compared the stability of pre-mirnas and other kinds of rnas in seven plant species and showed that pre-mirnas form more stable secondary structures  <cit> . currently, the lower limit of pre-mirna thermodynamic stability is widely used as a criterion for predicting and verifying sequences of rna that constitute pre-mirna  <cit> .

however, several studies have characterized pre-mirna sequence and structural features that can lead to pre-mirna instability. the unwinding of pre-mirna foldback duplex structure is critical for processing of pre-mirnas  <cit> . therefore, less stable pre-mirnas may be processed more easily. pre-mirnas have higher total adenine  and uracil  contents than other kinds of rnas  <cit> . as a-u and guanine -cytosine  form two and three hydrogen bonds respectively, pre-mirnas with a higher a+u content may be less stable. some studies of mirna biogenesis in animal species have suggested that instability, or enhanced flexibility of pre-mirnas, resulting from mismatched nucleotides, bulges, and especially unstable base pairs at the 5' end, can increase the efficiency of dicer enzymes involved mirna biogenesis  <cit> . the human nuclear processing enzyme drosha has also been found to selectively cleave pre-mirnas hairpins bearing a large terminal loop   <cit> . this type of terminal loop could also result in pre-mirna instability. while these studies provided evidence for structural and sequence features that destabilize pre-mirnas, a systematic investigation of pre-mirna instability has not been carried out. it has been shown that there is a tendency against unstable pre-mirna structures  <cit> . however, the question remains: is there a tendency against ultra stable secondary structures in pre-mirna sequences?

a correlation between pre-mirna stability and nucleotide sequence conservation would be expected due to natural selection, if there is a range of stability that directly or indirectly results in efficient pre-mirna functioning. mirnas were previously regarded as highly conserved  <cit> , but a number of non-conserved mirnas have been recently found in closely related species  <cit> . to investigate the relationship between sequence conservation and thermodynamic stability, we compared the thermodynamic stability of conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas from human, mouse, and chicken genomes, with special emphasis on ultra stable and unstable pre-mirna sequences. we also investigated the correlation between pre-mirna structural elements and sequence conservation.

RESULTS
stability comparison between conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas
we calculated the minimum free energy  values of  <dig> conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas. as the mfes increased linearly with sequence length, we normalized the amfe values to  <dig> nucleotide sequence to yield adjusted mfes   <cit>  for comparing pre-mirna thermodynamic stability . potential artefacts arising from difference sequence lengths were excluded by using amfes for comparisons. conserved pre-mirnas were divided into three conservation levels, termed as sc <dig>  sc <dig>  and sc <dig>  representing low, moderate, and high levels of conservation, respectively . non-conserved pre-mirnas were classed as sn. the summary of the pre-mirna stability, sequence length, and conservation was given in additional file 2_sheet  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the distributions of amfes for the conserved and the non-conserved pre-mirnas are shown in figure  <dig>  amfes in conserved and non-conserved pre-mirna groups were from normal distribution expect mouse sc <dig> group , and for each species we statistically compared the mean amfe and amfe variances of sn with sc <dig>  sc <dig>  and sc <dig> . for pre-mirnas from the human and chicken genomes, the mean amfes of the non-conserved and conserved pre-mirnas were not statistically different. for pre-mirnas from the mouse genome, although the mean amfes of sc <dig> and sc <dig> were significantly larger than that of sn at the  <dig>  fdr level, the mean amfe difference decreased and became non-significant for the sc <dig> pre-mirnas. the mean amfe of sc <dig> was only  <dig>  kcal/mol higher than that of sn, while the mean amfe of sc <dig> was  <dig>  kcal/mol higher. therefore, although pre-mirnas are significantly more stable than other non-coding rnas  <cit> , the conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas had relatively similar mean amfes.

the number of pre-mirnas within each set is indicated in brackets behind set name. a sc <dig> for chicken was excluded as it contained fewer than five pre-mirnas. amfe, the amfe mean values . pair-wise comparisons were performed between non-conserved  and conserved pre-mirnas  from human, mouse, and chicken genomes. p <dig>  p-value of two-sample two-sided t-test  for amfe means. p <dig>  p-value of two-sample two-sided f-test for amfe variances. * the p-value is significant at the  <dig>  fdr level.

unlike the mean amfe values, the amfe variances of the conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas were significantly different in all three species at the fdr  <dig>  level . moreover, the amfe variance consistently decreased from sc <dig> to sc <dig> in all three species . the amfe standard deviations of sn were  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> -fold larger than sc <dig> for pre-mirnas from the human, mouse, and chicken genomes, respectively.

conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas were classed as relatively ultra stable or less stable to further investigate the stability distribution of pre-mirnas. in each species, pre-mirnas with amfes in the top  <dig> percent were classed as ultra stable, and in the bottom  <dig> percent were classed as unstable. in the sc <dig> group,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  of pre-mirnas were ultra stable. in comparison, in the sn group,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  were ultra stable. similar results were obtained for unstable pre-mirnas. in the sc <dig> group,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  of pre-mirnas were unstable, while in the sn group,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  of pre-mirna were unstable. in summary, the mean amfes of conserved and non-conserved pre-mirna amfes were similar, but the distribution of amfes for conserved pre-mirnas was significantly smaller than that of non-conserved pre-mirnas.

sequence comparison between conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas
we next investigated how the pre-mirna nucleotide compositions were correlated with sequence conservation. firstly, for all pre-mirnas, we calculated the proportion of nucleotides forming base pairs  and the proportion of these base pairs that were a-u base pairs  %) . on average, the conserved pre-mirnas contained significantly more base pairs  than the non-conserved pre-mirnas . however, the mean values of  % for the conserved pre-mirnas were also significantly larger than those of the non-conserved pre-mirnas . on average,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  base pairs of the conserved pre-mirnas were a-u, compared with  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  of the non-conserved pre-mirnas. in this study, conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas had similar mean amfes. this is consistent with the base pairing results as a-u base pairs are less stable than g-c base pairs. so, although the conserved pre-mirnas have a higher bp % than the non-conserved pre-mirnas, this is offset by a larger proportion of a-u base pairs. on the other hand, the distribution variances of both bp % and  % could explain the observed stability variances. conserved pre-mirnas had consistently smaller bp % and  % variances than non-conserved pre-mirnas.

results represent the mean  of detailed information of base pairing and nucleotide composition. the number of pre-mirnas within each set is indicated in brackets behind set name. * sc <dig> for chicken was excluded as it contained fewer than five pre-mirnas. pair-wise comparisons of means  and variances  were performed between non-conserved  and conserved pre-mirnas  from human, mouse, and chicken genomes. a mean value significantly different from that of sn at the  <dig>  fdr level. a mean value is significantly different from that of sn at the  <dig>  fdr level. b variance is significantly different from that of sn at the  <dig>  fdr level. b variance significantly different from that of sn at the  <dig>  fdr level.

the nucleotide composition of the conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas was also examined, as shown in table  <dig> . all conserved pre-mirna sets had higher average a+u contents than g+c contents, while the a+u contents of the non-conserved pre-mirna sets were all below 50% and significantly smaller than the conserved pre-mirna sets, expect for the mouse sc <dig> set. compared with non-conserved pre-mirnas, conserved pre-mirnas had an increase of a and u contents but a decrease of g and c contents . notably, the u content of conserved pre-mirna was higher than a, g, and c. the average u content in overall conserved pre-mirnas was  <dig> % while the average a content was  <dig> %. furthermore, conserved pre-mirnas had  <dig> % higher u contents than non-conserved pre-mirnas while the a content was only  <dig> % higher in conserved pre-mirnas than in non-conserved pre-mirnas. in contrast, the g and c contents were  <dig> % and  <dig> % lower in conserved pre-mirnas than in non-conserved pre-mirnas respectively. we also observed that the nucleotide content of conserved pre-mirnas has a narrower distribution than non-conserved pre-mirnas.

structural element comparison between conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas
hairpin secondary structures can be divided into five basic structural elements  <cit> , including two kinds of stems  and three kinds of loops  . we examined whether conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas differed with respect to structural elements. we compared non-conserved pre-mirnas  with the most conserved pre-mirnas  from the three genomes, focusing on two features:  the ratio of the structural element length to the complete sequence length and  the ratio of u nucleotides to the total number of nucleotides within the structural element. two amfe thresholds were selected  corresponding to the 10th quantile and 90th amfe quantile of the sc <dig> pre-mirnas respectively. non-conserved pre-mirnas were denoted as snu, snm, and sns with amfes <t <dig>  t <dig> ≤ amfes ≤ t <dig>  and amfes >t <dig>  respectively. scm denotes the conserved pre-mirnas with amfes between t <dig> and t <dig> .

although amfes for pre-mirnas in the scm and snm groups were comparable , there was considerable variation in structural elements . for the non-conserved pre-mirnas, interior stem and first stem length ratios increased with increasing sequence stability. surprisingly, the scm group exhibited significantly larger interior stem ratios on average than the sns group . the snm group had smaller overhangs than both the snu and sns groups, but the overhangs of the scm group were even significantly smaller than those of the snm group . the scm group also had significantly lower interior loop ratios  and larger terminal loop ratios than the snm group . only first stem ratios of the scm and snm groups were comparable. on the other hand, the structural element u contents of conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas are shown in figure 3g-j. the scm group had significantly higher u ratios at interior stem region  than the snm group. the scm group also had higher u content on average than the snu group at terminal and interior loops, although the differences were not significant. no apparent increase of u content in the scm group first stem regions was observed. we did not compare u contents of overhangs due to their usually short element lengths.

discussion
here we present a systematic comparison of structural stability for non-conserved and conserved pre-mirnas from human, mouse, and chicken genomes. previous studies have compared comparisons between other kinds of rnas and native pre-mirnas, and have proposed that pre-mirnas are more stable  <cit> . our results from comparisons within the pre-mirna population provide novel insights into pre-mirna thermodynamic stability and possible links with the pre-mirna evolutionary process in animal species. the results presented here indicated both an upper and lower limit for pre-mirna thermodynamic stability, implying a natural selection pressure against both ultra stable and unstable pre-mirnas.

moderately stable pre-mirnas in animal could result from a trade-off between structural rigidity and flexibility. it is known that secondary structures of pre-mirnas are needed for a correct recognition of specific enzymes in the mirna biogenesis  <cit> . thus maintaining a stable secondary structure could be necessary for pre-mirna functioning, which could explain the result that unstable pre-mirnas were less favoured by natural selection. however, the process of mirna maturing also involves cleavage and duplex unwinding of pre-mirnas  <cit> . human drosha has been reported to selectively cleave pre-mirna with large terminal loop  <cit> , which was consistent with our observation that conserved pre-mirnas had on average larger terminal loops than non-conserved pre-mirnas. it is also known that duplex unwinding is critical for the processing of pre-mirnas to generate mature mirnas  <cit> . as a-u base pairs were less stable than g-c base pairs, larger  % of conserved pre-mirna could increase structural flexibility that facilitate the unwinding process. conserved pre-mirnas also had larger bp % than non-conserved pre-mirnas, which could be possibly ascribed to  the influence of bp % on duplex unwinding was minor and/or  a trade-off between structure rigidity and flexibility.

however, the natural selection pressure for pre-mirna stability could also involve selection for pre-mirna characteristics other than thermodynamic stability, but that affect pre-mirna stability as a side effect. we have shown that conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas with comparable amfes exhibited significant differences in structural elements. these differences might be due to a trade-off between pre-mirna structural rigidity and flexibility, but the possibility of selection for factors other than thermodynamics could not be ignored.

in this study, the enrichment of u nucleotides in conserved pre-mirnas was particularly noteworthy. high pre-mirna u nucleotide content might both contribute to maintaining moderate stability and serve as a signal for mirna biogenesis  <cit> . these results provide topics for future experimental and theoretical investigations, and raise an interesting theoretical question about the evolutionary dynamics underlying pre-mirna structure and stability. is the enrichment of u nucleotides in pre-mirna the result of step-wise mutation accumulations or filtering from non-conserved pre-mirnas? exploration of this question could provide a deeper understanding of the mirna evolutionary process and underlying mechanism.

as determining the conservation level of pre-mirna sequences was critical for our analyses, we chose three genomes with abundant pre-mirnas and used dual conservation constraints to select pre-mirnas in this study. although this method convincingly determined pre-mirna conservation, it also reduced the size of the pre-mirna population used for our investigation.  <dig>  sequences of pre-mirnas were obtained from human, mouse, and chicken genomes, from which  <dig> were selected for further analyses. as more pre-mirnas are identified and their sequence conservation determined, the size of the pre-mirna population available for study will increase, allowing for the identification of stronger general trends in the future. for instance, investigation of exhaustive mirna families would allow us to derive the pre-mirna evolutionary trajectory by comparing their thermodynamic stability, nucleotide compositions, structural features, and mutations from consensus ancestor sequences.

the results presented here might also be used in the future to predict or verify pre-mirna candidates. the correlation between pre-mirna thermodynamic stability and sequence conservation could be helpful for establishing more comprehensive pre-mirna filtering criteria in practical applications. for instance, a loose candidate sequence filtering constraint could be applied to identify novel non-conserved pre-mirnas for a given genome. on the contrary, a strict constraint for both unstable and ultra stable secondary structures would reduce the false positive rate for identifying novel conserved pre-mirnas.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings further the understanding of pre-mirna thermodynamics, and might facilitate the investigation on mirna evolution process. a correlation was identified between sequence conservation and thermodynamic stability for pre-mirnas from human, mouse, and chicken genomes. the distribution of amfes for non-conserved pre-mirnas was significantly larger than for conserved pre-mirnas but the overall mean amfes of the two groups were similar. investigation of pre-mirna sequence features was used to explain their stability distribution. compared with non-conserved pre-mirnas, conserved pre-mirnas form more base pairs on average but have a greater proportion of a-u bonds. furthermore, the variances of sequence features of conserved pre-mirnas, such as bp % and nucleotide composition, were consistently narrower than those for non-conserved pre-mirnas. notably, the u content of conserved pre-mirnas was higher than the a, g, or c content, while the non-conserved pre-mirnas had more g and c nucleotides, implying an importance of u nucleotide in pre-mirna evolutionary history.

in addition to thermodynamic stability, we identified characteristic structural element features of conserved pre-mirnas by comparing conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas with comparable stabilities. the results of this comparison indicated that the natural selection of pre-mirna structure and sequence involved more than thermodynamic stability, indicating that pre-mirnas evolutionary is a complex process.
