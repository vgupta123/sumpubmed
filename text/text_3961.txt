BACKGROUND
global climatic oscillations and associated glaciation cycles have profoundly influenced species population distributions  <cit> . pleistocene climate oscillations have contributed to the genetic structure of current species  <cit>  and have played an important role in initiating intra-specific divergences of north american animal taxa  <cit> . however, climate condition in china during glacial periods appears to have been different from those of the rest of the world and bring about a series of eco-environmental effects, primarily due to the continuing uplift of the qinghai-tibet plateau  <cit> . the uplift has heavily influenced the climatic and environment changes, and formed a complicated topography . the uplift has also had a decisive effect on the formation of the east-asia monsoon, which increased the climatic differences between the glacial and interglacial period and influenced the extent of the glacial advance in china  <cit> . additionally, climatic change induces changes in vegetation distribution, which also influences the distribution of animal populations through food chain and habitat modifications  <cit> . thus, the distribution and change of forest vegetation may have influenced the migration, expansion and even extinction of animal populations which differed considerably from other regions of the world at the same latitude  <cit> .

david's myotis  is endemic to china, occurring in a small province of middle and northern china  <cit> . this species is considered of least concern by iucn  <cit> . the measurements of the bat specimen have on average  <dig>  mm forearm length  <cit> ,  <dig>  mm wingspan and weight  <dig>  g . the wing morphology of this bat species is characterized by low wing loading and low aspect ratio, indicating that m. davidii has typically good manoeuvrability  <cit> . they prey on flying insects and inhabit rock or karst cavities  <cit> . generally, cavities inhabited by this species are located in forests with high levels of insect diversity . however, there are no reports about migration, hibernation or ecological preferences. previous research  <cit>  on animal fossils of china has shown that the survival of bats depended mainly on forest cover. furthermore, bat numbers or activity changes can be related to climate change  <cit> . thus, bats are a good model for examining historical processes and distributional patterns following climatic oscillations.

in china, studies on the geographic distribution pattern of vertebrates, such as bats  <cit> , birds  <cit>  and amphibians  <cit> , have described evolutionary histories following the global pleistocene climatic oscillations and reflected differences with europe in terms of evolution history in the context of complex regional scenarios  <cit> . colonization events, dispersal patterns and migratory behaviours play a key role in determining a species' geographical distribution range and demographic history  <cit> . in addition, both historical events and ecological factors shape extant genetic diversity and population structure of animals  <cit> . usually, analysis of genetic markers can be useful to successfully differentiate fine-scale structures in natural populations  <cit> .

different markers have their own unique genealogy, which may indicate concordance or divergence from the species' history. mitochondrial dna only reveals a species' maternal demographic history. however, microsatellite-derived data is influenced by sex-biased dispersal because of the character of biparental inheritance. thus, the combination of different markers may actually provide complementary information to test the population demographic history  <cit>  and extant population structure  <cit> . we therefore chose to include both nuclear dna  and mitochondrial dna  analyses in our study of the phylogeography of m. davidii, for which genetic diversity, demographic history, and population structure remain unknown. our main aims were to identify genetic diversity, describe macrogeographical population genetic patterns, and investigate the population demographic history within a context of climate oscillations, complex topology and eco-environmental variation since the mid-late pleistocene. we inferred the historical causation of the extant population structure to better understand its distribution and population status. additionally, we wanted to identify possible conservation management units and ultimately use information from the study to provide some advice on the further protection for m. davidii.

RESULTS
based on our research from  <dig> to  <dig>  m. davidii was found to be scarce, but the distribution range was more extensive than previous records. based on topography and physiography, populations of m. davidii can be divided into three regions: middle east plain , southwest plateau , and south hills  .

mep represents middle east plain; swp represents southwest plateau; and sh represents south hills. the number of individuals per population , number of haplotypes , haplotype diversity , nucleotide diversity , observed heterozygosities , expected heterozygosities , allelic richness , inbreeding coefficients .

mtdna and ndna genetic diversity
examination of mitochondrial hvi sequences showed length variation . the r <dig> repeat  within mtdna hvi region which responsible for the length variation of hvi region, were excluded from the analysis. after exclusion of the tandem repeats, the  <dig> bp sequence of the hvi region revealed  <dig> different haplotypes, defined by variation at  <dig> polymorphic sites. thirty-eight of these polymorphisms were the result of indels, and  <dig> polymorphic sites were parsimony-informative. haplotype diversity  averaged over all populations  <dig>  ±  <dig> . haplotype diversity  was uniformly high and was the highest in the mep region . most haplotypes were unique . other haplotypes were shared within populations , among populations  or among regions  . nucleotide diversity  averaged over all populations  <dig>  ±  <dig> . patterns of variation in nucleotide diversity across regions were consistent with that of haplotype diversity in that the greatest diversity was found in the mep and the lowest in the swp and the sh lineages .

analysis of ndna genetic diversity indicated that observed heterozygosity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and allelic richness ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  among populations . we did not detect any statistically significant deviations from hw equilibrium among the eight loci . no genotypic linkage disequilibrium was found between or within population samples. none of the inbreeding coefficients  were significant at the population level , suggesting random mating within populations and the absence of null alleles.

phylogenetic and demographic analysis
maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference  yielded highly concordant results . each tree revealed that m. davidii formed a monophyletic lineage with respect to congeneric species . in three trees, haplotypes grouped into two clades, representing the swp/sh and mep lineages . divergence time was estimated to be  <dig> ka  based on the results of mdiv analysis. the former lineage was further subdivided into two subclades, swp and sh , for which the divergence time was estimated to be  <dig> ka bp .

in regard to the neutrality tests, negative values of tajima's d and fu's fs in mep  and swp  were all significantly deviated from "0" , which can be interpreted as a signal of demographic expansion in both regions. however, sh and the populations in the whole distribution range did not indicate demographic expansion based on the non-significant p values of tajima's d and fu's fs . a mismatch distribution analysis also indicated population expansion events in mep and swp based on a small and nonsignificant ssd and r values . the population expansion time was  <dig>  ka bp and  <dig>  ka bp in mep and swp, respectively .

population structure
an amova revealed significant genetic variance for all three hierarchical levels examined  . the grouping pattern was mep , swp , and sh  gave the highest Φct value . most of the genetic variance  was explained by differences among the three regions . the subdivisions depicted by the amova are consistent with the macrogeographical structure of china . in addition, the analysis of amova highlighted a low but significant microsatellite genetic variation  among the three regions and a high proportion of genetic of variation  within populations . in mtdna, the pairwise genetic differences among populations varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>   , and only  <dig> % of pairwise genetic differences were not significant in the whole population. in ndna, the pairwise genetic difference among populations varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>   , and  <dig> % pairwise genetic differences in the swp lineage were not significant. thus the pairwise genetic differences among populations within regions were smaller than among regions in both markers . these results suggest that the genetic differentiation maximizes among the three regions.

a mantel test indicated that genetic subdivision within m. davidii fits an isolation-by-distance model  with respect to mtdna. however, nuclear markers failed to support isolation-by-distance model .

due to its small sample size, the cq <dig> population  was excluded from the structure analysis. clustering of individuals based on their multi-locus genotypes revealed substantial hierarchical structure among populations across the species range . when we assigned individuals to clusters at k =  <dig> clustering recovered two groups, which is in agreement with the ml tree lineages  . at k =  <dig>  the swp and sh groups formed a distinct cluster which is in agreement with the sub-lineages of ml tree . individuals from sh region showed the least similarity with the mep region. swp region was observed to be separated into two clusters at k =  <dig>  represented by a relatively low-elevation plateau  and a relatively high-elevation plateau, with evidence of a cline in membership between these clusters. an additional division was detected between cq <dig> and other populations in the swp region at k =  <dig>  the separation at k =  <dig> and k =  <dig> was not the same as the ml tree lineages. the division was detected between ah2-zj and other populations in the mep group at k =  <dig>  however, a marked separation was found between ah <dig> and zj in the ml tree. within the mep region, individuals were assigned to two or more populations at k = 5- <dig>  whereas they can trace ancestry to more than one population. the results of individual assignment test indicated a frequency gene flow within the mep region. no marked variation in the population structure was detected at k ≥  <dig> 

individual assignment test indicated that a greater proportion of individuals of m. davidii  were assigned to the populations from which they were sampled. within the mep, swp and sh regions,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the individuals, respectively, were assigned to other populations. thus, results of the individual assignment test also pointed toward higher gene flow among populations within regions, especially within the mep region. when using individual assignment tests according to the three mtdna clades, one individual  in the swp  group were assigned to the sh  group. two individuals  in the mep  group were assigned to the swp  group. three individuals  in the swp group were assigned to the mep group, where yn <dig> and gz <dig> originated from zj/js and jx, respectively. thus,  <dig> % of individuals were assigned to other lineages, which indicated a weak gene flow among the three regions.

discussion
genetic structure of populations
compared with similar study on bat mtdna  <cit> , m. davidii showed higher mean nucleotide diversity . the presence of high h and high π indicated that a sub-lineage formed over long periods of evolutionary time  <cit> . in addition, a high h and high π indicated high levels of divergence within three regions, which was attributed to secondary contact between previously differentiated allopatric lineages. like other bat species  <cit> , m. davidii was not detected the continuity gene flow among populations based on mtdna. in addition, isolation by distance was an important factor for the formation of genetic structure within maternal populations. the pattern of subdivision into subpopulations can be explained by the influence of environmental characteristics. in china, the west-east axis was a direction of the prominent changes in many environmental variables, such as vegetation types, temperature, precipitation, and topography, all of which were due to the continuing uplift of the qinghai-tibet plateau. the dependence of genetic differentiation on a gradient of environmental variables is in agreement with the theoretical model of doebeli & dieckmann  <cit> , showing that processes of evolutionary diversification may lead to sharp geographical differentiation along environmental gradients. the environmental gradients existed for an extended period of time which reflected in mtdna.

however, the population genetic structure in microsatellite loci was less pronounced than in the case of mtdna analysis. bayesian clustering analysis  and individual assignment test showed frequent migration within regions. and the patterns of migration followed a stepping-stone colonization model. large and non-significant fis values also showed frequent transfer in males among populations and led to an unobvious population structure. patterns of genetic differentiation in two molecular markers were attributed to male dispersal and female philopatry  <cit> . male-biased gene flow implied low introgression of mtdna haplotypes from neighboring populations, and therefore greater structuring in mtdna as compared with nuclear markers.

our comparisons showed that the deepest phylogenetic split  among the haplotypes corresponded exactly to ndna-based structure when genotypes were in two groups . the deepest phylogenetic split was similar to the pattern obtained from rhinolophus ferrumequinum in china  <cit> . swp and sh lineages split during stage iii of the glacial epoch in the yun-gui plateau   <cit> , and separated into two geographically defined lineages , which was in agreement with the results of the ndna analysis . the population genetic structure was consistent with topographic and geographic characteristics of china. thus, ecological environmental changes, landscape structure differentiation, and the climate discrepancy are primary determinants of population boundaries and rate of movement among regions  <cit> .

when these regions were considered separately we found clear differences in the phylogeographical signal obtained from the two sets of markers. multi-locus genotyping data suggest that m. davidii has multiple levels of population structure , which were not shown by mtdna. compared with mtdna, the concordance between the two markers seemed to break down within the swp clade. these similarities and discrepancies between the data sets together clarify the history of this species within the swp region. in the swp, four sampling locations in yunnan, formed an independent lineage , which coincided with the elevation difference of other populations . this result is in agreement with previous studies on birds  <cit>  and amphibians  <cit> . however, ndna analysis indicated that the separation of the yn1-yn <dig> vs. other populations in the swp group was maintained following the introduction of a fourth and fifth microsatellite-based cluster, which indicated much more frequent contact between yn <dig> and yn <dig> populations than between these two and any other population. additional discordance at k =  <dig> indicated postglacial colonization across the whole range of swp region with evidence of a cline in membership between these clusters. discordance at k =  <dig> indicated that cq <dig> population might be isolated by geographical barrier, although cq <dig> and other locations  were all in the same lineage of the phylogenetic tree . these clusters in yn1-yn <dig> and cq <dig> may represent a discrete, discontinuous jump across a relatively small geographical distance. the gene exchange among m. davidii populations in swp also may be impeded by the limit of landscape.

in the mep region, no obvious population structure was found at the higher level of k = 5- <dig>  which indicated a continual population contact with one another. extensive and overlapping ranges within the mep region of the bayesian clustering analysis  indicated the absence of geographical features in the landscape that would not constitute efficient barriers for bat dispersal. sh also showed no clear population division and indicated a much more stable population structure than that of mep.

population demographic reconstructions
since the middle and late pleistocene, violent glacial-interglacial cycles , complicated topology and eco-environmental changes due to the qinghai-tibet plateau uplift  <cit>  had important influences on the demographic history of many species  <cit> . with the complexity climatic conditions due to glacial oscillation and qinghai-tibet plateau uplift, chinese species have experienced a unique evolutionary history  <cit> .

based on the divergence time estimated among mtdna lineages, the demographic history of m. davidii could be traced back to before the riss glaciation  during the pleistocene  <cit> , which was similar to the glacial epoch in middle, southern and southwestern china   <cit> . both markers thus support the scenario that the swp and sh groups have a similar history and a common origin, while a parallel evolving history is observed for the swp/sh and mep lineages.

in the mep lineage, a population expansion event of m. davidii was occured around  <dig>  ka bp . this expansion thus took place during the end of the last interglacial period , one of the warmer periods  <cit> . the expansion time was younger than of the greater horseshoe bat  for japan   <cit>  and was nearly the same as amphibians of the same region   <cit> . the different expansion time with the greater horseshoe bat may be due to the influence of glacial oscillations at different latitudes at the same time  <cit> . bats are sensitive to environmental changes  <cit> , such as the large-scale marine transgressions in the mep region  <cit> , which may influence bats' migratory behaviour and geographic distribution  <cit> . thus, a stepwise population expansion, inferred by individual assignment test of ndna, has taken place in association with eco-environmental changes.

in the swp region, a population expansion event of m. davidii occurred around  <dig>  ka bp , and originated from relatively high elevation areas in swp to the mep during 72- <dig> ka bp   <cit> . the expansion time was a little earlier than that of the greater horseshoe bat  for europe  and during the same period for russia   <cit> . two haplotypes  were shared between yn populations in the swp and ah1-js populations in the mep region. this conclusion is in agreement with previous studies on bats  <cit> , birds  <cit>  and amphibians  <cit> . the result of ndna analysis  and an individual assignment test also indicated that some individuals of m. davidii shared the same ndna alleles in the swp and mep regions, and no cline across these populations. the high elevation areas of the swp region were the first to be affected by the sudden cold weather caused by the lowering of the snow line during the last glacial period   <cit> . therefore, some species or individuals in high altitudes may have immigrated to refuges, such as yunnan, or to other regions in order to avoid such cold climatic conditions.

based on the analysis of microsatellite data, a possible regional population contact was interpreted, which showed a similar allele site among populations in the sh group . although the phylogenetic tree was interrupted between sh and swp, the relationship between swp and sh groups was much closer than mep based on the mtdna results , which may be an indication of swp and sh origin from a common ancestor.

refuges for myotis davidii
at least two refuges have been reported in east china and in the lower elevations of the southwestern plateau  <cit> . in our study, the existence of three mitochondrial lineages, with high nucleotide and allelic diversity directed towards three relict refuges for m. davidii in china, where an initial population expansion took place. there is no clear indication of where the refuge of m. davidii populations were located, but the possible areas are the low-elevation plateau, such as yunnan area and sichuan basin , where there were large-scale relict refuges for many species  <cit> . in our study, the results of ndna analysis imply a relatively simpler genetic structure for m. davidii in yn1-yn <dig> and cq <dig>  which is attributed to relict refuge during the last glaciations. the eastern coast and south hills all were glacial refuges which were indicated by the high nucleotide and allelic diversity of both markers. this trend also has been demonstrated for other species  <cit> .

protection considerations
genetically divergent populations are increasingly being recognized as appropriate units for conservation. the results presented here potentially indicate three conservation management units . for the different management units, we suggest that protection require several different measures. as for the mep region, in considering frequent contact among populations, there may be no barrier in population migration due to the lack of mountains. therefore, it is important to strengthen the protection of these habitats. in the swp and sh regions, the gene exchange among m. davidii populations may be impeded by the limit of landscape. therefore, it is important to protect migration corridors. in addition, cq <dig> is located in the three gorges area at the entrance of the sichuan basin. small mammal fossils in the three gorges area indicate that it provids a corridor for the exchange of fauna occurring in temperate and more tropical areas to the south  <cit> . the position of cq <dig> in the phylogenetic tree also points to a corridor of genetic exchange between the mep and swp/sh regions. in addition, the finding that fst and Φst values between cq <dig> and other populations within the mep region exceed values among all the other populations suggests that populations of m. davidii are especially vulnerable to small population effects and fragmentation. a corridor of genetic exchange, such as cq <dig>  and prey or colony habitats should be protected to maintain population contact and its population persistence.

CONCLUSIONS
m. davidii is considered to be of least concern by iucn  <cit> . also, before  <dig> there were no systematic studies made of the distribution limit, status, and phylogeography of chinese endemic bat species. our research has shown that the distribution range of this species is more extensive than indicated by previous records. m. davidii also were found to be scarce and were not found in most recorded locations during the last nine years. therefore, the public, environmental protection agencies, and various stakeholders should spark efforts for its future protection.

high haplotype and nucleotide diversity indicate that m. davidii has had a long evolutionary history. based on the analysis of mdiv, the differentiation times among the three regions were during the riss glaciation , and the population differentiations correspond to a series of geological events and glacial cycles. the populations in the mep and swp experienced expansion events at about  <dig>  ka bp and  <dig>  ka bp, respectively. the phylogeographic study showed deep genetic differentiations among populations of m. davidii. glacial cycles, ecological barriers and topological differences are associated with the extant distribution patterns and phylogenetic clades of m. davidii. the populations of m. davidii formed multihierarchical population structures and also conserved high genetic diversity in each region. the degree of genetic differentiation, based on the analysis of mtdna and ndna of m. davidii, suggests a male-mediated gene flow among populations or regions.
