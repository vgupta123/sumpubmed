BACKGROUND
the tick-transmitted protozoan theileria parva is an apicomplexan parasite that is phylogenetically distantly related to the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum <cit> . t. parva causes east coast fever , a costly tick-borne disease that kills about  <dig> million cattle per year in eastern, central and southern africa  <cit> . ecf threatens some  <dig> million cattle in  <dig> countries and is now putting at risk a further  <dig> million animals in new regions, such as southern sudan, where the parasite has recently been discovered to be endemic  <cit> .

the life cycle of t. parva involves transmission of the sporozoite stage to cattle or buffalo in the saliva of feeding adult and nymphal rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks  <cit> . within the bovidae host, sporozoites invade lymphocytes and this ensuing multi-nucleate schizont stage immortalizes infected lymphocytes and divides in synchrony with them, ensuring that the parasite is transmitted to each daughter cell. a proportion of schizonts develop subsequently into merozoites followed by the piroplasm stage that is infective to the r. appendiculatus ticks. after ingestion by the tick, free piroplasms develop into micro- and macro-gametes that undergo syngamy to form the diploid zygotes  <cit> . zygotes undergo meiotic division accompanied by sexual recombination resulting in the development of the kinete stage that later invades tick salivary gland type iii acinar cells. sporozoites differentiate within these acini and become the infective stage again for mammalian hosts  <cit> .

vaccination against ecf is achieved by the live “infection and treatment” immunisation method that induces potent cytotoxic t cell responses against the schizont stage of the parasite  <cit> . this immune protection is partially t. parva isolate-specific, dominated by responses targeting a limited range of antigens in the vaccinated animal and vulnerable to breakthrough infection upon challenge  <cit> . for obligate sexually reproducing eukaryotic pathogens with a complex life cycle in arthropod vectors and mammalian hosts, a map of recombination events is essential for understanding parasite genome evolution. such data provide insight into the mechanisms of immune evasion and host and parasite co-evolution. in-depth studies for t. parva are at an early stage due to lack of informative high-resolution markers. the approaches previously used to dissect t. parva parasite polymorphism and recombination events include monoclonal antibodies  <cit> , gene probes binding to multi-copy loci  <cit> , panels of micro- and mini-satellite markers  <cit>  and most recently the sequence polymorphism in antigens that are targets of cd8+ t cell responses  <cit> . while useful to generate preliminary information, these techniques were unable to provide high resolution dissection of recombination events at the whole genome level.

recent experimental analyses performed in t. parva based on a panel of variable number tandem repeat  and pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers  <cit>  indicate high frequencies of crossover events. an initial linkage map of t. parva has been constructed using  <dig> vntr markers and  <dig> recombinant clones derived from ticks fed on cattle co-infected with muguga and marikebuni stocks  <cit> . the average genome-wide crossover rate was calculated to be approximately three times higher than that in plasmodium falciparum. in total  <dig> crossover  events, ten recombination hot spots and  <dig> cold spots were identified  <cit> .

massively parallel dna sequencing technologies are becoming affordable for genotyping and have been applied to map recombination events by sequencing progeny strains and their parents across a wide range of different taxa. these include humans  <cit> , rice  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , toxoplasma gondii <cit>  and most recently p. falciparum <cit> . the elucidation of the t. parva  genome sequence  <cit>  provides a reference template for the generation of a genome-wide panel of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers for high-resolution genotyping.

we describe herein the whole genome sequencing of two recombinant clones resulting from co-infection experiments of cattle with different t. parva isolates. with the panel of high density snp markers established via sequencing, we identified crossover and non-crossover events, as well as co-associated gene conversions. intra-species genome comparison identified a preliminary list of genes undergoing positive selection, which can be useful for the future systematic analysis of t. parva genes involved in co-evolution with its tick vector and its cattle and cape buffalo  hosts.

RESULTS
whole genome sequencing, mapping and de novo assembly
in this study, we sequenced four t. parva isolates using the roche  <dig> gs flx titanium chemistry , which included two parental parasite isolates, marikebuni and uganda, and two recombinant clones derived from experimental co-infection experiments of cattle. after tick pick up, sporozoites were isolated from tick salivary glands and used to re-infect t. parva-naive cattle to finally recover purified piroplasms for dna sequencing. the two recombinant clones sequenced here were denoted mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda. the other parent for both recombinant clones was t. parva muguga, the reference isolate previously sequenced using the sanger shotgun method  <cit> . the sequencing coverage ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> fold, with an average of  <dig> fold. the  <dig> reads were first mapped to the muguga genome and a mapped assembly was obtained for each strain . although more than 98% of the muguga genome could be mapped with  <dig> reads for each of the strains, the sub-telomeric regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  were less well covered , as were the sub-telomeric regions of chromosome  <dig> -c1a, data not shown). these regions contain hyper-variable multi-copy gene families, such as the tandemly arrayed tpr family on chromosome  <dig>  which could only be partially assembled in the reference genome  <cit> , and sub-telomeric gene families, which are known to be isolate-specific in some instances  <cit> . since the mapping algorithm randomly assigned repetitive reads to one of the mapped regions, unmapped regions were most likely due to highly variable sequences in the strains, although some might also be due to low complexity sequences .

the  <dig> reads were also assembled de novo into scaffolds and contigs . for all isolates except mugugamarikebuni, the n <dig> contig length produced by the de novo assembly was higher compared to that of mapped assembly, indicating that de novo assembly was less fragmented. the total numbers of bases assembled were also significantly higher  in all isolates for the de novo assembly compared to those in the mapped assemblies, irrespective of the difference in sequence coverage between isolates. this also suggested the presence of highly divergent sequences among the strains, from which the reads could not be mapped back to the reference t. parva muguga sequence but could be assembled de novo.

southern blot analysis of recombinant mugugauganda using telomeric probes
the analysis of the mugugauganda recombinant clone generated in this cattle co-infection and tick pick-up experiment revealed a mixed genotype by southern blotting using a telomeric probe . the presence of two fragments of muguga origin  and three smaller fragments of uganda origin  was detected. the parental origin of the other three fragments is ambiguous and we presume that they are in the large dna fragments at the top of the gel that are not fully resolved . there were three fragments of muguga origin  and one of putative uganda origin  that were absent from the mugugauganda recombinant . there was no evidence found for novel fragments within the mugugauganda recombinant and for major rearrangements adjacent to the telomeres, as has been demonstrated to occur in p. falciparum <cit> . all five polymorphic telomeric ecor <dig> fragments were identical in size to either the muguga or uganda parents, consistent with simple telomeric structure of t. parva that lacks major tracts of telomere-associated simple repeat sequences  <cit> .


identification of snp markers and parental alleles
snps in the two parental and two recombinant progeny clones were first identified by mapping the  <dig> reads to the muguga reference genome. the de novo assemblies were also aligned with the muguga genome with the aim of identifying snps in regions where the sequences were too divergent for mapping. of regions unmapped in the muguga genome, approximately 60% of the nucleotides remained unaligned . many of the genes that fall within these regions overlap with  <dig> genetic loci encoding t. parva antigens or multi-copy gene families that are likely to be under selection for diversification, such as the sub-telomeric sfii st and svsp families, the cd8+ target antigen tp <dig>  and the hyper-variable tpr locus . others were either hypothetical proteins with unknown functions or contained low complexity repetitive sequences .

in total,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> snps were identified in marikebuni, uganda, mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda, respectively . in all four isolates more than 65% of the snps were found in exons, between 14% and 17% of the snps were in introns while 18-19% of snps were in intergenic regions  . the proportions of snps observed in each category correspond to the proportions of these categories found in the genome  <cit> . within exonic snps almost equal proportions of synonymous and non-synonymous snps were observed for all isolates.


by combining the snp markers of the parent and the corresponding progeny strain, we were able to genotype  <dig> snp markers in mugugamarikebuni, and  <dig> snp markers in mugugauganda .  <dig> marikebuni and  <dig> uganda markers were not typed in the corresponding progeny strain due to lack of confident consensus calls in the progeny strain. high confidence non-parental snps were retrieved in the progenies –  <dig>  and  <dig>  in mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda, respectively. a majority of these non-parental snps were observed as alleles of minor frequencies  in its non-muguga parental counterpart  as would be expected from an infection of non-clonal parental strains. these snps were excluded from further analyses. the average distance between adjacent markers that could be genotyped in both progeny strains was  <dig> bp. this resolution is over  <dig> times higher than in the recently published p. falciparum recombinant map  <cit>  and more than  <dig> times higher than in the current t. parva genetic map  <cit> . the level of sequence coverage here was similar to that in the p. falciparum study, suggesting that snp numbers between the t. parva parents were much greater than in p. falciparum. in both progeny strains, the majority of the snp alleles on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes  were inherited from the non-muguga parent. for example, in the mugugamarikebuni clone, only 1-2% of the snp loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had muguga alleles. in mugugauganda, the bias towards uganda alleles was less prominent - 5%, 41% and 29% loci had muguga alleles in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . chromosome  <dig> had inherited more t. parva muguga-derived alleles  than non-muguga alleles  in both mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda. southern blot data supported this analysis by indicating that the tandemly arrayed tpr locus located on chromosome  <dig> was similar to that of muguga .


detection of crossover events
in the current study, we genotyped one mugugamarikebuni and one mugugauganda recombinant clone using more than  <dig> thousand markers. a sliding window of  <dig> contiguous snp markers  <cit>  was implemented for identification of cos. fifteen and  <dig> co breakpoints were identified in mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda, respectively . the average distance between cos detected was  <dig> kb, with a median distance of  <dig> kb . this can be compared to the previously determined t. parva linkage map, where the median number of cos per clone was  <dig>  and the average and median distance of cos were  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively. the much higher marker density achieved in our study allowed for the detection of more cos, especially cos separated by shorter distances . two mugugamarikebuni and four mugugauganda co breakpoints fall within previously defined high frequency recombination sites, whilst one mugugamarikebuni and three mugugauganda co breakpoints overlapped with sites previously defined as non-recombinogenic  <cit> . two mugugamarikebuni and two mugugauganda cos occurred within the sub-telomeric regions. these were not detectable in the earlier study due to the lack of vntr marker coverage in those regions .


the high marker density also allowed us to study co associated gene conversions . in mugugamarikebuni, eight  of the co breakpoints were simple breakpoints, where one parental allele changed into the other parental allele without any associated gene conversion. the other seven were complex breakpoints, associated with conversion tracts containing frequent allele changes. the length of the gene conversion tracks ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb, with a median length of  <dig> bp . in mugugauganda,  <dig>  were simple breakpoints and  <dig>  were complex breakpoints. the median length of gene conversion tracks was  <dig> bp  . in both progeny strains, the median length of the conversion tracks accompanying co breakpoints was much shorter than the observed length of  <dig> kb in yeast  <cit> .

the percentage of complex breakpoints  was higher to those reported for p. falciparum recombinants  and yeast . such complex gene conversion tracks associated with cos have been predicted to result from the resolution of a double holliday junction because of multiple distinct hetero-duplexes in a single co event  <cit> . mismatch repair alternating between conversion and restoration could also lead to formation of such complex gene conversion tracks  <cit> . this high fraction of cos accompanied by gene conversions could contribute to the diversity and evolutionary success of t. parva, by not only redistributing existing genetic variations, but also by changing allelic frequencies.

in mugugauganda, each chromosome had at least one co event, which is consistent with the expectation of one obligate co per pair of homologous chromosome  <cit> . in mugugamarikebuni, no co events were detected in chromosome  <dig>  chromosomes without detectable cos were also observed amongst the  <dig> mugugamarikebuni recombinant parasite clones typed with the vntr markers . this might be due to the fact that the obligate co on chromosome  <dig> could have been formed on the sister chromatid not analyzed here.

effects of detection methods on crossover identification
to investigate the effect of the method employed for crossover identification, two sliding window methods to determine cos were implemented and applied for both progeny strains. one method varied the number of snps  and the other method varied the physical distance . the number of snps  selected for each window size has been used in a similar study  <cit> . the physical distances  that were calculated based on the mean marker distance of  <dig> bp, roughly corresponded to the average distances between  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> snps, respectively.

in both methods, smaller window sizes identified more cos, and the extra cos tended to be smaller. for example, when the sliding window size was decreased to seven contiguous markers, one co breakpoint of  <dig> kb was detected on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig>  mb in mugugamarikebuni, which was not identified using larger window sizes. on chromosome  <dig> in mugugamarikebuni, the  <dig> kb window also detected two cos, which became undetectable when the window size increased. counts and positions of major co events remained the same for both methods, although the sensitivities of the two methods seemed to vary for small cos. for example, both the  <dig> snps and the  <dig> kb distance windows scanned through the chromosomes with an average resolution of  <dig> kb, the window of  <dig> kb called smaller cos in both progeny strains on most chromosomes compared to the  <dig> snp window. also, the estimated sizes of the breakpoints obtained from these two methods were not always identical. for example, co breakpoints on chromosome  <dig> at positions around  <dig>  mb in mugugamarikebuni were detected by all window sizes. the breakpoint sizes calculated by the snp method were too short to be visible on graphical plots, while those calculated by the method of physical distance were large enough to be visible in the plots of the same resolution . on chromosome  <dig> in mugugamarikebuni, the opposite was observed; here the breakpoints became visible with the snp method but not with the physical distance scanning.

the differences between the two methods can largely be explained by the variation of snp densities along the chromosomes. windows of snps would scan through highly variable regions with shorter physical distance, while windows of physical distances would scan through such regions with higher number of markers. consequently, in regions with higher marker density, the snp method would detect smaller cos and in regions with lower marker density the distance method would annotate smaller cos. in our study, the distance method identified higher numbers of smaller cos than the snp method, suggesting that regions of lower marker density were more abundant in our dataset than regions of higher marker density. we decided to use the snp method using  <dig> markers for further analysis for the following practical reasons. first, the method has been applied in a similar study in p. falciparum <cit>  therefore allowing a direct comparison of the results between the two species. second, we wanted to minimize detection of small cos as our study design did not make such calls with high confidence. ideally, cos would be events where nucleotide sequences change from parent one  to parent two  in one meiotic product and from p <dig> to p <dig> in another at similar positions. an event where such a change in nucleotide sequence occurs only in one meiotic product is a non-crossover   <cit> . however, due to the technical challenges involved in generating recombinant clones, in the current study only one out of four meiotic products was sequenced for each pair of parental clones. consequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the cos could be tracts of ncos. for example, small cos found on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> in mugugamarikebuni  might actually be ncos, considering the very low number of muguga alleles observed on these two chromosomes .

detection of non-crossover events
the high density of markers also allowed us to characterize non-crossover  gene conversions. fifty-two and  <dig> nco events were identified in mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda, respectively . in both progeny clones, all chromosomes carried one or more ncos. in total, we identified  <dig> cos and  <dig> ncos for mugugamarikebuni and  <dig> cos and  <dig> ncos for mugugauganda. this sum of cos and ncos  was lower than the estimate of 140– <dig> double-strand breaks  per meiosis in yeast, but higher than the  <dig> described in p. falciparum <cit> . yeast and p. falciparum are not suitable comparators for t. parva as although the genome sizes of yeast and t. parva are similar  yeast has more chromosomes . additionally p. falciparum, which is pylogenetically closer to t. parva, has a larger genome . the total recombination events we observe is likely to represent a minimal estimate of the true total. the stringent definition of nco applied here may have missed conversion events involving less than three snp markers, or those that may have resulted in restoration of the original alleles. nco signatures containing a complex pattern of genotype changes were also not included in the totals. this includes several long and complex gene conversion signatures observed in sub-telomeric regions in both progeny clones . by analyzing only one meiotic product out of the four, theoretically half of the cos and two thirds of the ncos would have been missed. we were not able to differentiate long ncos  from cos either, although this would not affect the total. as discussed earlier, genotyping of all four meiotic products will be needed to address these issues  <cit> .

compared to the length of co-associated gene conversion signatures, the length of nco conversion tracks was not significantly different , which deviates from previous observations in yeast and humans  <cit> . the median length of the nco gene conversion track was  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda, respectively. this is considerably shorter than estimates from saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit>  but similar to those in homo sapiens <cit> . in mugugamarikebuni, seven ncos overlapped with the previously defined co hot spots and eight with putative non-recombinogenic regions. in the mugugauganda progeny clone considerably more ncos overlapped with the known co cold spots compared to hot spots . in both strains, ncos were distributed rather uniformly across each chromosome, including the sub-telomeric regions. however, clusters of ncos were also observed such as in the sub-telomeric region of chromosome  <dig> 

crossover and non-crossover interference
the distance between recombination events could reflect interference. in yeast co-co and co-nco interference has been reported  <cit> . we analyzed the distributions of distances between co-co , nco-nco , and co-nco  events. all three distributions were consistent with the poisson distribution , suggesting there was no measurable interference among the recombination events. however, more measurements would be required for a thorough study of interference among cos and ncos.

effects of marker density on detections of crossover and non-crossover
to test if snp marker density had an effect on recombination frequency, we calculated marker densities along each of the chromosomes using a  <dig> kb window, and graphically plotted the total number of cos  against their corresponding marker density values. similar plots were generated for cos identified using vntr by katzer f. et al.  <cit>   and ncos found in this study . we found a reduced frequency of cos in regions of high marker densities and the methods used to identify cos had little effect on this correlation. similar observations that sequence divergence between parental strains adversely affects co frequencies have been reported in yeast  <cit> .


genomic locations of recombination breakpoints
the location of breakpoints differed between cos and ncos. most of the nco breakpoints  occurred within genes, while ~15% were either located in igr or overlapped with the gene-igr boundary . in contrast, a majority  of the co breakpoints overlapped with the gene-igr boundaries, only five  mugugamarikebuni and three  mugugauganda co breakpoints fell within genes. most dsbs are known to occur in the promoter regions  <cit> . classical eukaryotic promoter elements are thought to be absent in apicomplexan species, and it appears that regulatory motifs located in the igr are responsible for transcription regulation  <cit> . studies in yeast showed that > 84% of dsbs were located in promoter regions  <cit> . in comparison, a significantly smaller proportion  of co and nco breakpoints in mugugamarikebuni - 47%  of cos, 3%  of ncos - and mugugauganda - 42%  of cos, 15%  of ncos - overlapped with the putative promoter regions. interestingly, of the breakpoints that overlapped with promoter regions, 25%  and 28%  in mugugamarikebuni and mugugauganda, respectively, contained four of the five most over-represented regulatory motifs in t. parva identified by guo and silva  <cit> .

correlation of recombination events with chromosome size
in the two recombinant clones analyzed, the number of cos and ncos did not correlate with chromosome sizes . there were differences in the distribution of cos among the four chromosomes in the two recombinant clones. for example, on chromosome  <dig> of mugugamarikebuni, there was one co per  <dig>  mb, while it was one per  <dig>  mb in mugugauganda. distributions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were similar in both progeny strains, with one co per  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  respectively. chromosome  <dig> showed the lowest number of cos in both clones. analysis of more recombinants would be essential to substantiate these results and to identify any correlations, if they exist.

intra-species polymorphism analysis
although t. parva genes potentially under positive selection have been previously identified by inter-species polymorphism analysis  <cit> , genome wide intra-species polymorphism analysis has not been performed systematically. we aligned  <dig> t. parva muguga mrna sequences to genome drafts of marikebuni, mugugamarikebuni, mugugauganda and uganda. about  <dig> mrna sequences could be fully aligned and were subjected to ka/ks analysis . the mean value of ka/ks ratio was about  <dig>  . in total, we identified  <dig> genes with ka/ks ratio above  <dig> among the four strains . comparison of these genes to the eukaryotic orthologous groups  did not find any functional category that was enriched within these genes potentially under positive selection. the blat alignment method of identifying gene homologues in the four strains limits our analysis to less diverged genes. genes with highly divergent sequences were not subjected to ka/ks calculation as a full-length sequence alignment with their respective muguga counterpart was not obtained. amongst these diverse genes is the ctl antigen, tp <dig>  <cit>  that was found to be under positive selection in cattle and buffalo isolates  <cit> . pain et al.  <cit>  predicted a total of  <dig> orthologous genes between t. parva and t. annulata genomes. inter-species ka/ks analyses of these orthologous genes produced highest ka/ks values for predicted merozoite surface proteins and macroschizont proteins without predicted membrane retention motifs potentially secreted into the leukocyte cytosol. these proteins could be involved in immunological interplay between host and parasite. amongst genes without kog matches but with ka/ks ratio above  <dig> was tp02_ <dig>  which has been annotated as a putative sporozoite surface protein. its orthologue in t. annulata has been characterized as sporozoite and macro-schizont gene  <dig>  expressed in sporozoites, macro-schizont-infected leucocyte and piroplasm stages. a monoclonal antibody specific for spm <dig> blocked partial invasion of sporozoites to host cells indicating that this protein could play a role in protective immune responses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
roche  <dig> gs flx titanium chemistry was used to sequence the  <dig>  mbp genomes of two haploid progeny clones from an experimental t. parva co-infection in cattle and two of the parent isolates. all four strains were genome typed by comparing the  <dig> reads with the t. parva muguga reference genome, which represented the other parent of both recombinant clones. our data demonstrate that the a-t rich genome of t. parva can be reliably sequenced and assembled with  <dig> technology. the panel of genome-wide snps established can be used for molecular epidemiology studies in the future, particularly to trace potential new alleles introduced in t. parva endemic regions by applying the live vaccination method of “infection and treatment”  <cit> . additionally, the list of genes with high ka/ks values by intra-species comparisons can be further explored for potential functional implications. the high resolution mapping of cos and ncos on all four chromosomes showed patterns distinct from p. falciparum, yeast and humans. the high number of gene conversion events found to be associated with recombination between different t. parva genotypes was not previously known. this observation, together with the relatively high crossover frequency reported previously <cit> , indicates that meiotic recombination plays a very important role in generation and distribution of genetic diversity in t. parva population, which is essential for the evolutionary success of the pathogen. the high multiplicity of infection in both cattle and the ancestral wildlife host, cape buffalo, suggests that recombination processes may occur frequently under natural conditions, thus contribute to the high level of polymorphism observed in t. parva in the field.
