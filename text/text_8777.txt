BACKGROUND
lymph node involvement is the first indication of spreading and a strong prognostic factor for epithelial cancers  <cit> . a better understanding of the development of metastatic tumor phenotypes and the identification of molecular markers for lymphatic spread would be useful in design of improved treatment strategies  <cit> . cervical carcinomas have been studied extensively during the last years in the search for biological characteristics that are associated with lymph node involvement. tumor volume is among the strongest prognostic factors. severe hypoxia, high level of lactate, high proliferation rate, increased angiogenesis, high interstitial fluid pressure, and low apoptotic activity have also been associated with poor prognosis  <cit> , suggesting that these are metastasis promoting phenotypes. the molecular biology behind these phenotypes has not been clarified, but the proliferation proteins egfr and erbb <dig>  the anti-apoptosis proteins ciap <dig> and bcl <dig>  and the glucose transporter glut <dig> may be involved  <cit> . a more comprehensive characterization of the tumors is, however, needed to achieve a complete understanding of how metastatic phenotypes develop in cervical cancers.

gene expression microarrays are useful for discovery of new genes that are regulated in metastatic tumors  <cit> . panels of genes associated with lymph node metastasis have been identified for several cancer types by using this technique  <cit> , suggesting that the gene expression program is altered in metastatic as compared to nonmetastatic tumors. genes related to treatment outcome or lymph node metastasis have also been identified in microarray studies of cervical cancers  <cit> . less than  <dig> patients were included in these studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the results. moreover, protein expressions or copy numbers of the genes were not addressed.

in the present work we have used microarrays to identify gene expressions associated with metastatic phenotypes of cervical cancers and to investigate whether gains or losses of these genes could play a role in the transcriptional regulation and phenotype development. locally advanced primary tumors of squamous cell origin, all receiving curative radiotherapy, were included. treatment outcome differs considerably among these patients, emphasizing the need for identifying and exploring risk factors. we report  <dig> genes that differed in expression between lymph node positive and negative tumors, as diagnosed from magnetic resonance  images. these genes provided a basis for further analyses and enabled us to generate hypotheses of gene functions in metastatic tumors. the importance of gains and losses for the expression of these genes were explored by including genomic microarray data in the analyses. the gene data were further related to progression free survival, since this end point is a stronger indicator of the metastatic capacity of the tumors than the diagnosed metastatic status per se. unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed to identify coregulated genes that were probably associated with the same phenotypes.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes in node positive versus node negative tumors
twenty-nine patients were diagnosed with pathologic lymph nodes in the pelvic region, including three with additional pathologic para-aortic nodes, whereas  <dig> patients were node negative. thirty-one genes with major difference in expression when comparing the data of node positive and negative tumors, were selected. these were  <dig> genes with higher and  <dig> with lower expression in the node positive tumors  and included genes coding for structural proteins, such as the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins mrps <dig> and mrpl <dig>  enzymes participating in metabolism, like the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pdk <dig> and the hexokinase hk <dig>  proteins interacting with the extracellular matrix, such as moesin  and the hyaluronglucosaminidase hyal <dig>  the cell division cycle cdc <dig> protein kinase regulatory subunit  <dig> , the proteinase inhibitor cystatin a , and others with multiple or more unclear functions with regard to metastasis development, like the hypothetical proteins mgc <dig>  lsm <dig>  and flj <dig>  the muscleblind-like protein mbnl <dig>  the t-box transcription factor tbx <dig>  the krüppel-like factor klf <dig>  the annexin anxa <dig>  and the myocyte enhancer factor mef2a . the data of probes representing the same gene, but with a different sequence, were always highly correlated , and the most differentially expressed probe is listed. the microarray data showed significant correlation to quantitative real time  pcr measurements of selected genes .

gene copy numbers
pronounced gene copy number changes were observed in most tumors, and gains on chromosome 1q, 3q, and 5p and losses on 3p were among the most frequent ones . the  <dig> genes identified from the gene expression microarray analysis were selected for further analyses . gain and/or loss was seen for all these genes , however, the aberrations were generally not frequent and occurred in less than half of the tumors for all but csta on 3q <dig>  some genes were located on the same chromosomal region , such as mrps <dig> and pdk <dig> on 17q , and the data of these genes were highly correlated . significant relationship between the gene copy number changes and expressions was found for seven genes: mrps <dig>  msn, lsm <dig>  anxa <dig>  mbnl <dig>  flj <dig>  and mgc <dig>  for which aberrations were detected in 5– <dig> tumors . among these genes, the copy number changes correlated with metastatic status for anxa <dig> and flj <dig> . the comparison of the data between node positive and negative tumors was, however, hampered by the very few cases with aberrations.

protein expressions
immunohistochemistry was performed on five genes , for which differentially expression between node positive and negative tumors was observed and antibodies were commercially available, to assess the protein expression and identify the cell types expressing the gene. all proteins were expressed in tumor cells , and expression was also seen in stroma cells for hk <dig>  mef2a, and msn. the expression levels differed considerably among the tumors for all proteins. to search for relationships between gene and protein expression, the immunostaining in both tumor and stroma cells was considered by calculating an average score for the two cell types using data on tumor cell fraction. for csta and msn there was a linear relationship between protein and gene expression, but for cks <dig> a certain transcript level seemed to be needed before protein was detected . we therefore compared the immunostaining score between the quartile of cases  with the highest gene expression and the remaining  <dig> ones for cks <dig> and csta, which were upregulated in node positive tumors, and between the quartile of cases with the lowest gene expression and the remaining  <dig> ones for msn, hk <dig>  and mef2a, which were downregulated in node positive tumors. the immunostaining score of cks <dig>  csta, and msn was significantly higher in the cases with high gene expression compared to those with low , in concordance with the gene expression results. the difference remained significant when only the immunostaining in tumor cells was considered for msn . no correlation between gene and protein expression was found for mef2a or hk <dig>  regardless of whether immunostaining in both cell types  or only in tumor cells was considered .

progression free survival
the data of the differentially expressed genes were related to progression free survival in univariate analysis to find the genes with the strongest relationship to metastasis. the correlation was significant for the expression of mrpl <dig>  pdk <dig>  klf <dig>  mrps <dig>  cks <dig>  tbx <dig>  lsm <dig>  and msn , suggesting that these genes were more strongly associated with metastatic phenotypes than the others. mrpl <dig>  cks <dig>  and pdk <dig> were the most significant ones . the highest significances were generally achieved with the categorised data and are listed for all genes, although the ratios  were more significant for mrps <dig>  cks <dig>  lsm <dig>  tumor volume was the strongest prognostic factor among the clinical variables . metastastic status per se, as determined by mr imaging, showed no prognostic significance due to the limited number of patients, however, number of pathological lymph nodes was significant. multivariate analysis identified mrpl <dig>  tbx <dig>  and pdk <dig> expression as independent prognostic gene variables, whereas only tumor volume was identified in a model containing the clinical variables . tumor volume and pdk <dig> expression remained independent prognostic variables when both clinical and gene variables were considered.

univariate analysis of the gene copy number changes, categorised as gain, loss, or no change, showed a significant relationship to progression free survival for mrps <dig> , pdk <dig> , and msn . although the aberrations were not frequent, occurring in  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  tumors, they seemed to have a pronounced influence on the survival probability when they occurred . the relationship for mrps <dig> and pdk <dig> was similar, except for two additional losses of pdk <dig>  reflecting their colocation on chromosome 17q. the three tumors with gain of pdk <dig> had a high pdk <dig> expression, however, there was no general correlation between expression and aberration for this gene . the results in figure 4b for pdk <dig> could therefore be a consequence of its colocalization with mrps <dig>  the results of mrps <dig> and msn, on the other hand, were consistent with our observations that the aberrations correlated with the expression levels of these genes  and that the expression levels showed prognostic significance .

in univariate analysis of the protein expressions the immunostaining score of the tumor cells was included as continuous data, without considering the score in stroma cells. the data showed a significant relationship to progression free survival for cks <dig>  and msn , but not for csta, mef2a, and hk <dig>  the largest difference in survival was achieved when using a cut off for the immunostaining score of  <dig> and  <dig> for cks <dig> and msn, respectively . the protein data were therefore in concordance with the gene expression results, showing that high expression of cks <dig> and low expression of msn were associated with poor survival .

gene clusters
unsupervised clustering of the eight prognostic genes was performed based on the gene expression microarray data  to identify genes that were coregulated in the same tumors and therefore probably associated with the same phenotypes. the genes clustered into two major groups with high degree of collinearity , one group with msn, tbx <dig>  lsm <dig>  cks <dig>  mrpl <dig>  and mrps <dig> and another with pdk <dig> and klf <dig> , suggesting that they were associated with at least two distinct phenotypes. the data of the former group, except for msn expression, showed a significant correlation to tumor volume , whereas no such relationship was found for pdk <dig> and klf <dig> expression.

to ensure that the expression data of each phenotype separated the patients into groups with different survival probability, unsupervised clustering of the patients was performed. the combined expression data  of each group of coregulated genes were used in two separate analyses. clustering based on msn, tbx <dig>  lsm <dig>  cks <dig>  mrpl <dig>  and mrps <dig> expression identified four tumor groups, for which patients of group  <dig> and  <dig>  with high expression of lsm <dig>  cks <dig>  mrpl <dig>  and mrps <dig> and, in general, low expression of msn and tbx <dig> compared to group  <dig> and  <dig>  had the lowest survival probability . seven of the eight tumors with gain of mrps <dig> or loss of msn were in these groups. a similar analysis based on klf <dig> and pdk <dig> expression, separated two major tumor groups, for which patients in the group with high pdk <dig> and low klf <dig> expression had the lowest survival probability . all tumors with gain of pdk <dig> were in this group. each of the two phenotypes indicated by the coregulated genes in figure 5a were therefore associated with poor progression free survival probability and therefore with metastasis development.

discussion
genes that differed in expression between node positive and negative cervical tumors and therefore may be related to metastatic phenotypes, were identified in our study. our data on protein expressions and gene copy numbers provided information on the cell type expressing the genes and the regulation mechanisms involved. the frequent copy number changes, especially on chromosome 1q, 3q, 3p, and 5p, were consistent with previous reports  <cit> . copy number changes of the differentially expressed genes were, however, less common. such changes do probably not play a role in development of the metastatic phenotypes in the majority of tumors, for which other transcriptional regulation mechanisms seem to be important. it should be noted that no general conclusion about the role of gene copy number changes in development of the metastatic phenotypes could be drawn from our study, since only selected genes were considered. gains or losses of other genes may be important and even influence the expression of the genes addressed here.

the protein data were not correlated with the gene expressions of two of the five proteins investigated, hk <dig> and mef2a. cross-reaction of the antibodies used for immunohistochemistry to other proteins may explain this apparent discrepancy. hence, although the mef2a antibody used was recommended for this protein, the producer states that cross-reactions to mef2c and mef2d may occur to a lesser extent. the protein data may also be less representative of the entire tumor than the gene expressions, since they were derived from a single biopsy whereas several samples were used in the microarray analyses. moreover, post-transcriptional control of the protein levels is a likely explanation of these results as well  <cit> .

we identified two independent groups of genes with prognostic significance, suggesting the existence of at least two major metastatic phenotypes of the locally advanced stages of cervical carcinomas. none of the prognostic genes have previously been associated with metastasis in this tumor type. genes, such as egfr, erbb <dig>  bcl <dig>  ciap, and glut <dig>  which have shown correlations to survival in protein studies  <cit> , were, however, not identified here. none of these were differentially expressed between the node positive and negative tumors with the cut off used in our study and therefore not considered in the further analyses. a separate analysis showed that egfr expression correlated with survival , in concordance with previous reports  <cit> . the other genes may be regulated post-transcriptionally or be prognostic in larger studies. our strategy was therefore not suited to find all prognostic genes, but ensured that the ones identified were truly associated with metastatic phenotypes. based on the current knowledge of gene function it was possible to relate the prognostic genes to biological characteristics that have been associated with metastasis development in cervical cancers and thereby propose molecular mechanisms underlying these characteristics.

mrps <dig>  mrpl <dig>  cks <dig>  tbx <dig>  lsm <dig>  and msn constituted the largest group of coregulated and prognostic genes. the former five genes probably play a role in tumor growth, since their expression showed a significant relationship to tumor volume. mrps <dig> and mrpl <dig> are structural components of the mitochondria. upregulation of these genes suggests increased mitochondrial activity, energy production through oxidative phosphorylation, and a high oxygen consumption rate. cks <dig> is involved in cell cycle control, and its activation has been associated with high proliferation of lymphoma cells and incidence of metastasis in colon carcinomas  <cit> . lsm <dig> and tbx <dig> may also participate in cell cycle control; upregulation of lsm <dig> promotes proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, and tbx <dig> may interact with the cell cycle protein cdkn2a  <cit> . our data are therefore consistent with increased mitochondrial activity and cellular proliferation in metastatic tumors, probably leading to rapid growth and large volumes. these phenotypes have previously been associated with poor prognosis of cervical cancer  <cit> , and our findings point to genes that are associated with and might participate in their development. furthermore, when gains and losses of mrps <dig> and lsm <dig> occur, they may influence the gene expressions and possibly the development of metastatic disease.

clustering of msn together with mrps <dig>  mrpl <dig>  cks <dig>  tbx, and lsm suggests a role of this gene in cell proliferation, consistent with previous studies  <cit> . loss of msn function may also cause cell depolarization, increased motility, and invasiveness, and therefore be directly involved in several steps during spreading  <cit> . msn repression may therefore actively promote metastasis development in some rapidly growing tumors. our data further suggest that gene loss leads to msn downregulation and is associated with a metastatic phenotype. loss of heterozygosity studies have shown increased imbalance on the x chromosome in lymph node metastases as compared to the primary cervical tumors, in agreement with this hypothesis  <cit> .

the other group of coregulated and prognostic genes, pdk <dig> and klf <dig>  is probably associated with hypoxia tolerance. activation of pdk <dig> directs glycolytically derived pyruvate towards anaerobic metabolism and lactate output rather than oxidative phosphorylation through repression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase  complex  <cit> . repression of klf <dig> may indicate increased glucose metabolism under hypoxia, although other functions involving growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, have also been proposed  <cit> . our data on pdk <dig> and klf <dig> therefore suggest activation of strategies to conserve energy and, hence, survive under hypoxia. hypoxia and high lactate content are prognostic factors for cervical cancer  <cit> , consistent with our hypothesis. moreover, repression of pdh subunit alpha  <dig> has previously been associated with treatment outcome of this disease  <cit> , and similar survival strategies are probably used in other tumor types, showing activation of lactate dehydrogenases  <cit> . our data showed that tumors with concurrent gain of pdk <dig> and mrps <dig> had high expression of mrps <dig> and pdk <dig>  large volumes above the median value, a very short survival time and, therefore, an extremely high risk for metastasis development, suggesting the combined characteristics of rapid proliferation, high oxygen consumption, and hypoxia tolerance.

the regulation of the other differentially expressed genes also contributes to the characteristics of metastatic disease. many of them were coregulated with the prognostic ones, and could be markers of a high proliferation activity or regulated in response to hypoxia. repression of ntn <dig> and hyal <dig> may promote cell migration and invasive growth, whereas bai <dig>  vwf, and epb41l4b probably participate in angiogenesis, attachment of tumor cells to endothelial surfaces, or reflect vascular structures in the tumors  <cit> . moreover, regulation of nek <dig>  csta, anxa <dig>  and ddost indicates activation of dna damage repair  and resistance to apoptosis   <cit> , whereas transcriptional downregulation of hk <dig> may be a result of glucose deprivation  <cit> . the roles of mbnl <dig>  rcl <dig>  mgc <dig>  ero1l, dnajc <dig>  plac <dig>  and mef2a are more unclear, but may involve regulation of proteins like the insulin receptor   <cit>  or proteins participating in development . elevated vwf plasma levels have been found in node positive cervical cancer patients  <cit> , consistent with our results. moreover, increased csta protein expression has been correlated with poor prognosis of breast carcinoma, whereas repression of ero1l has been shown to increase the recurrence probability of pulmonary adenocarcinoma  <cit> , suggesting that these genes are related to metastasis development also in other tumor types.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified genes associated with major metastatic phenotypes of cervical cancers that probably are related to rapid proliferation and hypoxia. copy number changes of the genes may be involved in development of these phenotypes in some cases, but other mechanisms for transcriptional regulation are probably important in the majority of tumors. the gene expressions may be useful markers of cancer spread, since they showed a stronger relationship to progression free survival than the metastatic status and number of pathological lymph nodes and added prognostic information to tumor volume. although our findings need to be confirmed in larger studies with more patients, they provide a useful basis for further investigations to reveal the mechanisms underlying development of these phenotypes.
