BACKGROUND
over the past decade, clostridium difficile has emerged as an important gut pathogen, causing hospital- and community-acquired diarrhea. the number of patients and the severity of disease have increased dramatically, due to the emergence of two hypervirulent pcr ribotype,  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> . traditionally, pcr ribotype  <dig> has been linked to nosocomial outbreaks. in contrast, pcr ribotype  <dig> has been detected frequently in farming animals, especially pigs  <cit> , and is found more during community acquired infection. the increase in c. difficile infections  of humans has boosted interest in c. difficile biology, diagnostics and pathogenesis.

in the past few years, multiple genome sequences of several pcr ribotypes have been determined  <cit> . the analyses of the genomes, aided by comparative genomics of dna-dna microarrays  <cit>  has shown that the genomes of c. difficile are highly variable with inserts of mobile dna from phage, plasmid or transposon origin. these mobile dna elements are actively moving within c. difficile genomes and are frequently passed on to neighboring bacteria, harboring mosaic genomes  <cit> . it is unclear what role the mobile elements play in the virulence of c. difficile. some virulence linked genes, for example the holin-like tcde, have a phage origin  <cit> . in fact, it has been suggested that the whole pathogenicity locus , encoding the major c. difficile virulence factors tcda and tcdb, is of phage origin  <cit> . recently, phages have been shown to upregulate toxin production in c. difficile, thereby increasing the virulence  <cit> . c. difficile transposons have been shown to contain antibiotic resistance genes  <cit> , and therefore acquiring such an element could increase the virulence and/or colonization potential of a particular strain.

mobile elements play an important role in the diversification of bacterial genomes. one important group of mobile genetic elements is the tn <dig> family of conjugative transposons   <cit> . these conjugative transposons usually code for tetracycline resistance and are found primarily in the firmicutes. numerous transposons have been described to be present in c. difficile genomes  <cit> . several elements closely related to tn <dig> are present in diverse c. difficile strains, including tn <dig> which confers tetracycline resistance  <cit> . other transposons have been described to confer resistance to chloramphenicol and erythromycin  <cit> .

recently, the first full length genome of a pcr ribotype  <dig> strain was published  <cit> . this m <dig> strain has been isolated from an irish diarrheic patient. it was shown that pcr ribotype  <dig> is highly divergent from pcr ribotype  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, this pcr ribotype  <dig> strain was described to contain a unique  <dig> kb insert that showed 80% similarity to sequences of thermoanaerobacter species and streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> . in this paper we show that the  <dig> kb insert is a mobile element that is only sporadically present in pcr ribotype  <dig> strains. furthermore, we show that the  <dig> kb consists of at least two independent mobile elements that were fused during evolution.

RESULTS
previously, an insert, unique for c. difficile, was described in the genome of strain m <dig>  a pcr ribotype  <dig> strain, isolated from an irish diarrheic patient  <cit> . we analyzed the open reading frames  present in the insert to investigate their nature and origin . 

the  <dig> kb insert has a modular composition
bioinformatic analysis revealed that the insert has a modular composition. the 3’ end of the insert  is homologous to tn <dig> of s. pneumoniae which confers erythromycin resistance. although this element has not been shown to transfer via conjugation, transfer via transformation was shown  <cit> . in c. difficile strain m <dig> this element appears to be the backbone into which several other elements have been inserted . the first  <dig>  kb on the 5’ end of the insert  has only moderate homology  to known sequences. interestingly, this part of the insert contains  <dig> putative modification dna methylases and a putative endonuclease, possibly enabling a form of molecular vaccination as described by kobayashi et al.  <cit> . during this process methylation protects the incoming element from host endonucleases and, following integration, will protect the host chromosome from endonucleases present on other mobile genetic elements. this sequence is followed by a complete prophage of approximately  <dig>  kb , which shows 92% sequence identity to a thermoanaerobacter sp. prophage . the next  <dig>  kb stretch  is 99% identical to part of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pef <dig> containing, amongst others, a putative methyltransferase and a putative spectinomycin adenyltransferase ia)  <cit> . it is also described to be part of a pathogenicity island in streptococcus suis <cit> . finally, an insertion of approximately  <dig>  kb  with 90% sequence identity to the transferable pathogenicity island of campylobacter fetus subsp fetus <cit>  is present within the sequence of tn <dig>  this sequence contains, amongst others, putative tet and ant-ib genes, which could respectively confer tetracycline and streptomycin resistance.

the g + c content of the entire insert  was significantly higher than that of the entire genome , clearly indicating that the insert was of foreign origin . in addition, within the insert the different modules could be distinguished by their g + c contents. the g + c content of module a, b, c, d and e was 31%, 41%, 35%, 28% and 31%, respectively.

the  <dig> kb insert is a transposon
based on the bioinformatic comparison of the insert described above, the possible excision of  <dig>  elements was predicted. primers were designed  to amplify the circular intermediates of the complete insert , the putative thermoanaerobacter sp. phage  and the c. fetus pathogenicity island  of the element. pcr confirmed only the excision and circularisation of the entire insert . it is expected that the serine recombinase at the 3’ end of the element is responsible for excision . sequencing of the circular intermediate was used to determine the precise ends of the element, showing the element is flanked by a tg dinucleotide; serine recombinases prefer a  <dig> bp crossover site identical in the target site and joint of the circular intermediate  <cit> . in silico extraction of this sequence from the genome confirms that the element is present in the homologous target site of ctn <dig> in strain  <dig>  <cit> . the precise size of the element is  <dig>  bp and it runs from bp  <dig> - <dig>   in the m <dig> genomic sequence . upon our request, the transposon number tn <dig> was provided by the transposon registry  <cit>  .

to test the conjugative transfer of the element, filter mating assays were performed, selecting for the possible tetracycline resistance by means of the tet gene. however, m <dig> contains also a copy of tet present on a conjugative transposon with 97% sequence identity to tn <dig> <cit> , which we have designated tn <dig>  this element has inserted intragenically in the homologue of c. difficile strain  <dig> orf cd <dig>  tn <dig> contains homologues to all tn <dig> orfs except orf <dig> which is involved in regulation of tet through transcriptional attenuation  <cit> .

during filter mating experiments with m <dig> as a donor strain and cd <dig> as a recipient, all putative transconjugants were identified as the recipient strain. in total  <dig> transconjugants were tested by pcr, using primers lok <dig>  lok <dig>  <cit> , <cit> , tn <dig> fw, and tn <dig> rev  <cit> . however, none contained tn <dig>  all contained only tn <dig> .

tn <dig> is sporadically present in pcr ribotype 078
simultaneously with the publication of the m <dig> sequence, we obtained illumina sequence reads of the c. difficile strain  <dig>  which was isolated from a diarrheic piglet from a pig farm in the netherlands  <cit> . comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> to m <dig> revealed an almost complete overlap of the two genomes. however, reference assembly of the  <dig> reads to m <dig> showed that tn <dig> was not present in  <dig> . this prompted us to investigate the prevalence of tn <dig> in pcr ribotype  <dig> strains. we designed a pcr to show presence  or absence  of tn <dig> in pcr ribotype  <dig> genomic dna . in addition, in view of the heterogeneous origin of tn <dig> and to investigate the presence of both the thermoanaerobacter prophage and streptococcus dna , we designed two more pcrs . finally, we designed a pcr to detect the presence of the tet gene present on tn <dig> . besides the sequenced  <dig> strain,  <dig> human pcr ribotype  <dig> strains and  <dig> porcine pcr ribotype  <dig> strains  were tested for the presence of these elements.

a minority of the isolates tested did contain a dna insert at the indicated location in the genome;  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates  were positive in the 1– <dig> pcr . remarkably, all  <dig> strains were tetracycline resistant human isolates. none of the porcine strains contained an insert at the position tested. strains positive in the 1– <dig> pcr were negative in the 1– <dig> pcr, and vice versa, showing complete complementarity of the two pcrs in pcr ribotype  <dig> strains.

*pcr only positive when no insert is present, §pcr only positive when insert is present #pcr detects module b, ¶pcr detects module e, †pcr detects module d. ‡ pcr only positive in strains containing half of the element. location of the oligonucleotides used is indicated in figure  <dig>  +, pcr positive; -, pcr negative; n.t., not tested.

evidence for multiple insertions in tn6164
all the strains that contained an insert  were further analyzed for the presence of module b and e present in tn <dig>  using primer pairs 4– <dig> and 6– <dig> . only nine of  <dig> strains positive for pcr 1– <dig> were positive for pcrs 4– <dig> and 6– <dig>  suggesting the presence of the complete element as described for m <dig>  the other  <dig> strains were only positive for module b , showing the existence of alternative  elements , as predicted by the bioinformatic analysis. the strains that were positive for module e  were also positive for module d . in contrast, strains containing module b, but not module e, thus containing only half the element, also lacked module d. this indicates that the 3’end of half the element was situated upstream of module d.

of the isolates that were only positive for the pcr 4– <dig>  the exact 3’end of the insert was determined by sequencing the pcr product obtained with primers  <dig> and  <dig> , which yielded a  <dig> bp product. the border of the 3’end was between the 3’ end of module c and the 5’end of module e. a similar sequence was found at the homologous site when the full element was present, but also at the 3’ end of the full element, the 5’ end of the element, the joint of the circular intermediate and the predicted target site as based on the  <dig> sequence . this indicates that tn <dig> was created by two elements integrating in the same target site  and fusing, with a second copy of the target site still present between the two original elements within tn <dig> 

absence of tn <dig> sequences in other pcr ribotypes
since pcr ribotype  <dig> has been shown to be very closely related to pcr ribotype  <dig>  with an almost indistinguishable pcr ribotype banding pattern, we also tested a small collection of pcr ribotype  <dig> strains with the 1– <dig> and 1– <dig> pcrs. in none of the  <dig> pcr ribotype  <dig> strains tested could we demonstrate the presence of an insert at the site in which tn <dig> was inserted in m <dig> .

in addition, a collection of  <dig> other pcr ribotypes was tested as well. this collection consisted of the  <dig> most frequently found pcr ribotypes in europe, supplemented with the leeds-leiden collection  <cit> . none of the other pcr ribotypes, was positive for pcr 1– <dig>  4– <dig> or 6– <dig> 

no antibiotic resistance phenotype linked to presence of tn6164
since several putative antibiotic resistance genes were found to be present on the element , strains containing full tn <dig>  only half of the element, or no element at all were tested for antibiotics resistance. resistance to tetracycline, spectinomycin and streptomycin was tested using several methods . surprisingly, no correlation was found between the presence of tet, antib or antia and resistance to tetracycline, spectinomycin or streptomycin .

r, resistant ; s, sensitive .

strains containing full tn <dig> are all genetically related
since we could not find many isolates containing tn <dig>  we reasoned that the element could be relatively recently acquired and that the isolates thus might be genetically closely related. therefore, we applied mlva  <cit>  on all the isolates containing tn <dig>  or only half of it, supplemented with a number of isolates without the element, to investigate the genetic relatedness of the strains. in figure  <dig>  a minimal spanning tree of all the isolates containing an element is shown, with control strains. based on the mlva, all the isolates containing full tn <dig>  are genetically related  and four of them are in one clonal complex. six isolates containing half of the element are also in this genetically related cluster, whereas the other three isolates containing half the element are not . 

suggestive link between the  <dig> kb insert and increased virulence
to investigate a possible increased virulence of strains containing the element, clinical parameters of patients with a c. difficile infection due to a strain that contained tn <dig> were compared to parameters of patients that suffered from a strain that did not contain the full element. patients with tn <dig> resembled patients without the element concerning demographic characteristics. clinical characteristics were only known for patients from the ecdis study  <cit>  and patients registered in the cdrl . patients with and without the element suffered from severe diarrhea in similar proportions. mortality due to cdi was more common in patients infected with c. difficile::tn <dig> . this suggests that tn <dig> might convert pcr ribotype  <dig> strains to a more virulent strain. however, since the number of patients infected with a tn6164-positive strain, and for which the clinical data was available, was very low , no multivariate analysis could be performed, which means that a bias cannot be ruled out. further research is needed to confirm a possible link between increased virulence and the presence of tn <dig> 

discussion
pcr ribotype  <dig> has recently emerged as a hypervirulent c. difficile strain  <cit> . previously published mlva studies have shown that all pcr ribotype  <dig> strains are closely related  <cit> , irrespective of human or porcine origin  <cit> , fostering the notion that pcr ribotype  <dig> infection could be a zoonosis. recently, the full genome sequence of a c. difficile pcr ribotype  <dig> strain was published  <cit> . this m <dig> strain was shown to contain a unique insert of approximately  <dig> kilobases. in this paper we show that this insert is a transposable element, tn <dig>  it is not representative for all pcr ribotype  <dig> strains. on the contrary, we found that the majority of the pcr ribotype  <dig> strains do not contain the element. moreover, some strains contain only half of the element. so, three different kinds of pcr ribotype  <dig> can now be distinguished: those with a full length element, those with half the element, and those with no element at all. tn <dig> was exclusively found in tetracycline resistant pcr ribotype  <dig> strains, isolated from humans. we tested a collection of other pcr ribotypes, of which none contained the element. since we only tested  <dig> strain per pcr ribotype, we cannot rule out the possibility that tn <dig> is present in other pcr ribotypes. we covered the whole genomic spectrum of c. difficile since we tested multiple samples of each genetic clade previously identified  <cit> . in addition, tn <dig> has not been found in any other c. difficile genome that has been published so far than m <dig> 

although tn <dig> contained a tet gene, we could not demonstrate increased tetracycline resistance of strains containing the element. previously, it has been shown that this gene, present on a homologues resistance island, is active in c. fetus <cit> . in c. difficile, the copresence of the tet gene on tn <dig> and the tet gene on the tn <dig> in one bacterium does not result in an increased resistant phenotype. also the spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance genes did not result in a phenotype, despite the presence of two potential aminoglycoside resistance genes ia) and ant) on tn <dig> . we do not know if the resistance genes are expressed in m <dig>  however, since we show the presence of the circular intermediate transposon dna, some activity of transposon related genes is expected.

since we have only found tn <dig> in strains also containing tn <dig>  it is possible that tn <dig> transfer is dependent on tn <dig>  further research is needed to investigate the possibility of tn6190-dependent transfer of tn <dig>  in addition, remarkably, tn <dig>  was significantly  more found in strains isolated from humans than in strains isolated from pigs. although the same strains circulate in humans and pigs  <cit> , and also tn <dig> circulates in pig strains  <cit> , we did not find any porcine strain that contained the element. we have no explanation for this difference.

none of the transconjugants tested showed the presence of tn <dig>  but all contained tn <dig>  these results indicate that tn <dig> has a  lower transfer frequency than tn <dig>  nevertheless, a complete set of proteins, required for transfer, is present on tn <dig>  loss of tn <dig> or introduction of another selection marker in tn <dig> <cit>  could prove to be a strategy to further study the capability of conjugative transfer of this element.

tn <dig> has integrated intergenically between homologs of the  <dig> orfs cd <dig> and cd <dig>  a trna methyltransferase and a hypothetical protein respectively. in strain  <dig>  this target site is occupied by the conjugative transposon ctn <dig> <cit> . there is no significant homology between tn <dig> and ctn <dig>  the empty target site is present in many sequenced strains of c. difficile. however, no other mobile genetic elements have been reported to integrate at this site.

it was impossible to phenotypically distinguish strains containing tn <dig> from strains without the element. although we have no transcriptional data available of the genes that are located on tn <dig> it is clear that it could provide an advantage under certain circumstances. in this respect it is interesting to note that the patients suffering from an element-containing strain are suggested to undergo a more severe illness than patients with a strain not containing tn <dig>  however, because of the low number of strains containing the insert no multivariate analysis could be carried out. therefore, we cannot rule out that these data are biased. further research is needed to confirm this observation.

isolates containing the full element originated from all over europe, including ireland, england, norway, germany, bulgaria, greece and the netherlands, whereas isolates containing half the element were only found in the united kingdom, spain and the netherlands. mlva showed genetic relatedness between most of the strains, although no epidemiologic link between the strains from different countries could be found. it has recently been shown that pcr ribotype  <dig> strains show a lot less heterogeneity in mlva than for instance pcr ribotype  <dig> or pcr ribotype  <dig>  <cit> . this could indicate a higher level of relatedness, or it could mean that the mechanism behind the mlva variability is different in pcr ribotype  <dig> strains than in other pcr ribotypes  <cit> .

altogether, we show the presence of a  <dig> kb transposon in some c. difficile pcr ribotype  <dig> strains. although we could not show any evolutionary benefits of the transposon, it could very well serve as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance  <cit> , for commensal bacteria in the human gut.

CONCLUSIONS
tn <dig> is a novel transposon of approximately  <dig> kb, found sporadically in clostridium difficile pcr ribotype  <dig> strains, isolated from humans. tn <dig> has a modular composition and is the product of multiple insertions of separate elements from various origins, as evidenced by the existence of strains containing only half the element. strains containing tn <dig> were all genetically related. we were not able to find a readily distinguishable phenotype for strains containing the element, although several potential antibiotic resistance genes were present on tn <dig>  tn <dig> may act as a source of antibiotic resistance genes in the human gut. further research is needed to investigate if tn <dig> plays a role in the virulence of pcr ribotype  <dig> clostridium difficile strains.
