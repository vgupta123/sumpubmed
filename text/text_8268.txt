BACKGROUND
the antagonistic interaction between host and pathogen results in adaptation and counter-adaptation in both players. the continual need for host immune systems to respond to evolving pathogens has led to the prediction that immune genes will show greater evidence of adaptive evolution than the genome average. this prediction has been supported in a recent study documenting the spatial allele frequency distributions in humans  <cit>  and in studies comparing amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees  <cit> , rodents  <cit> , chickens  <cit>  and between drosophila species  <cit> . however, not all genes within the immune system show a strong signature of adaptive evolution, possibly reflecting the diverse functional roles that immune system genes play. for example, the drosophila study of obbard et al.  <cit>  concluded that the global pattern was driven by a small number of genes within a limited portion of the immune system such as antiviral rnai genes and members of the immune deficiency  pathway. in addition to the expectation that immune genes as a class will show more adaptive divergence than non-immune system genes, it has also been hypothesized that immune genes involved in the recognition of pathogens will show stronger signatures of positive selection than signal transduction molecules, which are more likely to be the subjects of purifying selection  <cit> . in order to test the generality of these hypotheses, the analyses of multiple immune genes need to be extended to additional species.

here, we estimated the proportion of nucleotide sites that have been subjected to positive selection in immune versus non-immune genes in the crustacean daphnia pulex. we compared a set of  <dig> putative immune system genes to  <dig> non-immune system genes. the immunity genes were initially identified by searching the d. pulex genome for homologous sequences to genes known to be involved in the immune system of other arthropods  <cit> . coupling a phylogenetic approach such as mctaggart et al.  <cit>  with population genetic data can provide additional support that a gene might have an immunological role, and specifically whether it is co-evolving with pathogens. additionally, this type of approach can potentially uncover whether homologs play different roles in different taxa. finally, population genetic theory provides the framework to identify and describe the different types of selection that might be at play in host-pathogen interactions. our aim was to address the following questions:  do immune system genes in daphnia undergo greater adaptive protein evolution than non-immune system genes?  which immune system genes show the strongest signature of adaptive change?  what type of selective pressure  are the identified genes under?

RESULTS
we amplified  <dig> loci from daphnia pulex  and  <dig> loci from d. parvula  . we were not successful in amplifying a pcr product in all individuals at all loci. in particular, clone cc was difficult to amplify. phylogenetic analysis indicates that cc belongs to an incipient lineage of d. pulex, found in western oregon, called d. arenata <cit> , hence it was removed from all analyses, unless we failed entirely to amplify a pcr product from d. parvula . in the latter case, d. arenata samples were used as the outgroup. in total,  <dig> genes were classified as non-immune genes and  <dig> genes were classified as putative immune genes . there was no difference in the mean sequence diversity  between the cyclical parthenogenic  and the obligate asexual d. pulex samples  . thus, all d. pulex samples were considered as a single group for all other tests.

sequence diversity and divergence
there was a significant difference in the average pairwise number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  between d. pulex and d. arenata compared to d. pulex and d. parvula  , consistent with the much closer relationship between d. pulex and d. arenata. since including two species in the ingroup would artificially inflate estimates of its sequence diversity, the d. arenata samples were excluded from the mcdonald-kreitman tests, except for  <dig> single-locus tests in which they comprised the outgroup. likewise, all d. arenata samples were removed from the diversity and divergence calculations and multilocus analysis. over the  <dig> remaining genes, the average pairwise sequence diversity between d. pulex and d. parvula at synonymous sites  was = <dig>  and at non-synonymous sites  was = <dig>  , and the average pairwise sequence divergence at synonymous sites  was  <dig>  and at non-synonymous sites  was  <dig>  . there is no significant difference between the average πs —an estimate of 4neμ —of non-immune and putative immune genes , or in the average πa between the two gene classes . similarly, there is no difference in the average divergence at either synonymous or nonsynonymous sites between the two classes of genes .

two loci, caspase  <dig> and chitinase  <dig> have extremely high diversity  compared to the average , and comparable with the average ks , which could result if two paralogous loci were sequenced instead of one, or if two highly divergent alleles were being maintained by balancing selection. blastn of the sequences to the d. pulex genome does not suggest that we had amplified two loci. to be conservative they were removed from the multilocus mk analysis. the extremely high pairwise sequence diversity  seen for these loci also results in significantly positive tajima’s d statistics, reflecting a high proportion of intermediate-frequency alleles . again, this is consistent with either the amplification of multiple loci or balancing selection. caspase  <dig> also has the highest ka/ks ratio  , which is driven by an extreme excess of nonsynonymous substitutions between the species . kscaspase <dig> is also higher than average , although to a lesser extent.

mcdonald-kreitman tests
the mcdonald-kreitman test compares the within species nucleotide diversity to between species nucleotide divergence at synonymous and non-synonymous sites  <cit> . evolutionary theory predicts that if nucleotide substitutions are neutral, then the ratio of synonymous: non-synonymous changes will be equivalent within and between species. forty of the  <dig> loci showed sufficient polymorphism to conduct individual mcdonald-kreitman  tests . of these,  <dig> loci were significant or marginally non-significant prior to a benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate  correction , p =  <dig> ; scavenger  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; and toll  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). the significance is due to an excess of nonsynonymous divergence at the toll  <dig> and scavenger  <dig> loci , and an excess of non-synonymous polymorphism in mpi . after the fdr correction for multiple tests, none of the loci show a significant deviation from the expectations under a model of neutral evolution.

forty-seven out of  <dig> loci were included in the multilocus model . genes that used d. arenata as the outgroup  were excluded from this analysis as their inclusion violates the assumption of the model that the divergence time is equal at all loci. caspase  <dig> and chitinase  <dig> were removed for the reasons described above. the results of the likelihood ratio tests amongst the four models show that both m <dig> and m <dig> are significantly better than the null model m <dig> . of these two, the akaike information criterion strongly supports model m <dig>  where a separate α value is estimated for each class of genes , over m <dig>  = <dig>  versus  <dig>  respectively) . this is consistent with a significant permutation test between the two classes of genes : - <dig> ,  <dig> ), αimmune =  <dig>  , p =  <dig>  by permuting genes between classes).

the rank order between the estimate of the absolute number of adaptive nonsynonymous substitutions/nonsynonymous site  and α differed , indicating that the level of constraint may differ among the genes. the five loci with the highest a values are all classed as immune system genes . however, there is not a clear split between immune and control genes; indeed  <dig> putative immune genes are amongst those with negative a values. the gene with the highest estimated a =  <dig>   was marginally non-significant prior to the fdr correction  in the single locus mk test. the other gene that had significant mk tests prior to correcting for multiple testing , and was included in the multilocus mk test, was estimated to have a negative a value, indicating that either that some mildly deleterious alleles may be segregating at this locus, or that it was insufficiently sampled.

discussion
immune genes in daphnia undergo greater adaptive evolution than non- immune genes
consistent with the results obtained from humans  <cit> , rodents  <cit> , chickens  <cit>  and fruit flies  <cit> , our data support the hypothesis that on average immune system genes have experienced more adaptive evolution than non-immune system genes. specifically, the most likely evolutionary model for our data fits a separate and higher value of proportion of the non-synonymous divergence due to adaptive evolution  for immune  versus non-immune genes  . this is particularly striking since our classification of immune versus non-immune genes is likely to be conservative because, due to lack of functional information, we may have included immune genes in the non-immune gene group, which will lessen the actual the difference between the two classes. it is less likely that we have erroneously included non-immune genes in the immune class, as immune genes were only classified as such if functional information was available at homologous loci in other species. thus, this study illustrates that the effect of host-parasite co-evolution –which is the most likely driver of adaptive change in immune system genes – is strong and consistent across a diverse taxonomic range.

as not all immune system genes exhibit evidence of adaptive evolution, our data confirm the general conclusion that immune system genes are subject to a wide range of selective pressures  <cit> . one explanation for this variation is that molecules interacting directly with pathogens, either in their recognition or destruction undergo more adaptive changes than molecules that do not . in support of this hypothesis, a study in drosophila found that recognition molecules – but not signalling or effector molecules - had a significantly higher proportion of positively selected genes than the genome average  <cit> . additionally, effector molecules show evidence of positive selection in frogs and termites . in contrast, all members of the imd pathway in drosophila, including the signal transducers , showed evidence of adaptive change, while the recognition molecule that initiates this cascade did not  <cit> . while our dataset does not contain all members from a pathway, our results do not support the hypothesis; indeed a signal transducer  in the toll pathway is one of the five genes with the highest number of adaptive substitutions/site .

population genetic tests for adaptive evolution reveal likely candidate immune genes under selective pressure
in addition to testing if immune system genes as a class undergo more adaptive change than non-immune system genes, the estimates of α and a and/or single-locus mk tests from this study have identified several loci that may be evolving in a non-neutral manner. the first of these, toll  <dig>  encodes a transmembrane receptor that is activated by recognition proteins after fungal and bacterial invasion. toll  <dig> had the highest proportion of non-synonymous divergence due to adaptive evolution , as well as the highest number of adaptive substitutions per site . additionally, the single locus mk test was marginally non-significant because of an elevated number of nonsynonymous fixed differences between the two daphnia species. combined with the fact that this locus does not have an elevated synonymous site sequence diversity, indeed it is slightly lower than the average , we suggest that toll  <dig> may be evolving by directional selection. in contrast, we did not detect a signature of selection in the two additional toll genes included in this study . a phylogenetic analysis indicates that toll  <dig> is in a clade with toll  <dig>  while toll  <dig> is in a separate clade  <cit> . from this we speculate that the functionality of the toll  <dig> gene has evolved since its duplication from toll  <dig> 

similarly, the mcdonald-kreitman test showed that the scavenger  <dig> locus had a disproportionate excess of fixed nonsynonymous substitutions between d. pulex and d. arenata , consistent with adaptive divergence between the two species. scavenger receptors are responsible for binding a range of foreign ligands  prior to cellular internalization, and are therefore are candidate subjects of host-pathogen coevolution. at the scavenger  <dig> locus, we also observed that the proportion of silent polymorphisms in d. pulex was as high as silent divergence , but that πa was within the normal range. in contrast, scavenger receptors in drosophila have a rate of silent polymorphism that conforms to neutral expectations, but a higher rate of non-synonymous diversity compared to the genome average  <cit> . the observed pattern of variation in the daphnia scavenger  <dig> locus could be due to the amplification of multiple loci, recombination between loci or balancing selection. similarly, at the chitinase  <dig> and caspase  <dig> loci, these factors could drive the level of πs to be similar to ks, and tajima’s d to be positive and significant. thus, these three loci may be interesting targets for future population genetic studies examining the effects of host-pathogen co-evolution.

finally, the results of the single locus mk test indicates that a non-immune gene, the mpi locus, deviates from neutral expectations due to an excess of segregating nonsynonymous sites, which might be maintained by balancing selection. the negative value of α at this locus supports this hypothesis. however the deviation from neutral expectations could also be caused by weakly deleterious segregating alleles. the present study is unable to distinguish between these two hypotheses. nonetheless, studies in the acorn barnacle  have shown that mpi variation is differentially selected between distinct intertidal thermal habitats  <cit> . the daphnia sampled in this study span a large geographic distance  and therefore may experience selective structuring among populations due to some unknown environmental gradient. indeed, the non-synonymous sites segregating in d. pulex at the mpi locus are only found in the westernmost populations . since this is the only locus where polymorphisms segregate in this manner, this pattern is not due to population subdivision. further sampling at this locus in conjunction with an assessment of allelic fitness are needed to test if the mpi locus is under balancing selection in daphnia, as it appears to be in the acorn barnacle.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that, as a class, immune system genes show more adaptive evolution than non-immune system genes, supporting the hypothesis that host-parasite co-evolution is an important force in shaping genomes. as in drosophila, this result appears to be driven by a few genes within the class. our results also confirm that immune system genes experience a broad gradient of selective pressures and highlight that the targets of selection can differ among taxonomic groups. we have also identified two candidate loci under balancing selection and one under directional selection, demonstrating that the mode of action of selection in host-pathogen coevolution is variable.
