BACKGROUND
enzyme is important in biomass conversion and renewable energy production. however, biotechnological condition demands for thermostable enzymes. thermostability can be enhanced by fusing proper protein fragments, such as, the non-homologous fragments  <cit> , the thermophilic xylanase homologous n-terminus  <cit> , the hyper-thermophilic carbohydrate binding-module  <cit> , and the pseudoalteromonas arctica esterase osmc domain  <cit> . two catalytic domains, such as, xylanase and glucanase, can also be combined to create bi-functional chimeras  <cit> . however, the domain fusions were limited at xylanase one terminus. when fused at the other terminus, the clostridium thermocellum xylanase and thermotoga maritima glucanase activities were damaged  <cit> . thereby, domains need to be swapped with each other in fusion investigation.

xylanase  is widely used in feed, flour, baking industry, pulp bleaching, etc  <cit> . an aspergillus niger xylanase  has high catalytic activity   <cit> . the  <dig> residue enzyme is more suitable for domain fusion investigation, because it is the smallest xylanase in gh <dig> family. however, the xyn optimal temperature for activity  is 47 °c, and its thermal inactivation half-life  at 50 °c is  <dig>  min  <cit> . to break down complicated biomass  <cit> , the mesophilic fungal xyn needs enhanced thermostability and synergistic glucanase activity. an ideal partner is the t. maritima glucanase  , because it is hyper-thermophilic and  <dig> residue big   <cit> . linker-peptide is also important for enzyme thermostability  <cit> , because each domain needs necessary space to form to active conformation  <cit> . a linker-peptide , which was selected from the hyper-thermophilic t. maritima xylanase a  <cit> , was confirmed having enough space for connecting two domains  <cit> . thereby, the  <dig> residue linker-peptide is used to connect the a. niger xyn with the t. maritima glu to construct two chimeras, xyn-glu and glu-xyn . after expression in e. coli bl <dig>  the two chimeras exhibit bi-functional activities of xylanase and glucanase. especially, fusing the glu domain at c-terminus increases the mesophilic xylanase topt value and thermostability. the domain-swapping provides more insights into enzyme fusion investigation.

RESULTS
construction of chimeras
after step-extension pcr, the xyn-glu and glu-xyn construct genes appeared on the  <dig>  % electrophoresis gel as discrete dna bands at ~ <dig>  kb, approximately the combined molecular masses of contributing gene fragments . after the sequence accuracies had been confirmed for the recombinant plasmids , transformed cells containing pet20b-xyn-glu and pet20b-glu-xyn were induced to express the chimeric xylanases. the two proteins, xyn-glu and glu-xyn, appeared on the 10 % sds-page gel as discrete bands at ~ 53 kda. as expected, the molecular masses are approximately the sum of two contributing moieties , because the chimeras have residues equaling to the sum of xyn, glu, and linker peptide.

phopt: optimal reaction ph, topt: optimal reaction temperature, t1/ <dig> : thermal inactivation half-life, the residual xylanase activity was assayed after incubation at 50 °c at 10-min intervals from  <dig> – 30 min, and the residual glucanase activity was assayed after incubation at 95 °c at 20-min intervals from  <dig> – 60 min. km and kcat were determined for birch-wood xylan and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium .

properties of the chimeras
when properties were assayed, the two chimeras exhibited bi-functional activities of xylanase and glucanase. when xylanase activity was determined, both chimera xyn moieties had optimal reaction ph  at  <dig> , equivalent to the xyn. thus, fusing the glu domain at either terminus did not alter the xylanase ph property. both chimera xyn moiety activities decrease at ph higher than  <dig>  . as to thermal property, the xyn-glu xyn moiety had optimal reaction temperature, topt, at  <dig> °c, compared to  <dig> °c for the xyn . the xyn moiety had t1/ <dig> at  <dig> °c for  <dig>  min, ~  <dig> -times longer than the xyn . fusing the glu domain at c-terminus increased the xylanase thermo-activity and thermostability. in contrast, the glu-xyn xyn moiety had topt at  <dig> °c, equivalent to the xyn . however, the xyn moiety had t1/ <dig> value at  <dig> °c for  <dig>  min, shorter than the wild xyn. fusing the glu domain at n-terminus did not alter the xylanase thermal activity, but decreased its thermostability .

when glucanase activity was determined, both chimera glu moiety topt were higher than 96 °c, similar to the glu . the glu-xyn glu moiety had t1/ <dig> at 95 °c for  <dig>  min, and the xyn-glu glu moiety had t1/ <dig> clearly longer than  <dig>  min . the glu activity increased after incubation at 95 °c, because the chimera topt was higher than 96 °c and its thermostability was significantly high. fusing the xyn domain at either terminus, especially, at n-terminus, increased the glucanase thermostability. the glu-xyn glu moiety phopt was  <dig> ,  <dig> units higher than the xyn-glu glu moiety and the wild glu . fusing the xyn domain at c-terminus significantly shifted the glucanase ph property to higher ph environments.

when the kinetics were determined, the xylanase catalytic efficiencies  toward birch-wood xylan increased in the order xyn < glu-xyn < xyn-glu. the substrate-binding affinities  for birch-wood xylan increased in the order glu-xyn < xyn < xyn-glu . fusing the glu domain at either terminus cooperated with the xylanase to degrade substrate; however, fusing the glu domain at n-terminus interfered with the xylanase substrate-binding affinity. in contrast, the glucanase catalytic efficiencies  toward carboxymethyl cellulose sodium  increased in the order glu < xyn-glu < glu-xyn. the substrate-binding affinities  for cmc increased in the order xyn-glu < glu = glu-xyn . fusing the xyn domain at either terminus cooperated with the glucanase to degrade substrate; however, fusing the xyn domain at n-terminus interfered with the glucanase substrate-binding affinity. thus, a domain, especially, a bigger one, is better fused at c-terminus for enzyme getting higher activity.

the xyn-glu xyn moiety topt was 3 °c higher than the xyn. this is consistent with the xyn topt 3 °c increase after fusing the hyper-thermophilic carbohydrate-binding module  <cit> . previous domains were mainly fused at enzyme one terminus. for example, the bacillus subtilis xylanase was fused at the bacillus amyloliquefaciens glucanase c-terminus  <cit> . the t. maritima xylanase was fused at the t. maritima glucanase c-terminus  <cit> . the t. maritima β-glucosidase was fused at the t. maritima cellulase c-terminus  <cit> . when the domains were fused at the other terminus, the chimeras lost both moiety activities  <cit> . there are so many xylanase domains fused at glucanase c-terminus. the situation probably indicates that xylanase locates naturally at downstream of glucanase. it is probably a trace of natural evolution, because the site location order is shown in the glucanase-xylanase bi-functional protein selected from meta-genome library  <cit> . the domain-swapping created different effects on each moiety properties. the n-terminal glu domain decreased the xylanase thermostability; however, the c-terminal glu domain increased the xylanase thermostability. the glu has  <dig> residues, ~  <dig> -times bigger than the  <dig> residue xyn. probably, the c-terminal glu protects the xyn from thermal inactivation; whereas, the n-terminal glu interferes with the xyn folding and confirmation-forming, therefore, interferes with its thermostability. in contrast, fusing the xyn at either terminus, especially, at n-terminus, increased the glucanase thermostability. in addition, fusing the xyn at c-terminus shifted the glucanase phopt  <dig> units higher to alkaline environment. the result probably reflects that glucanase cooperates with other catalytic domains on both sides, because two glucanases, cela and celb, are shown connecting together in the t. maritima genome   <cit> .

each domain has a natural conformation to perform catalytic activity. therefore, each domain needs a necessary space to form to an active conformation  <cit> , that is the reason why a suitable linker-peptide is so important. the decreased chimera topt values in previous investigations are attributed to linker-peptide interference. for example, fusing the b. amyloliquefaciens β-glucanase decreased the b. subtilis xylanase topt value and thermostability  <cit> . fusing the t. maritima glucanase also decreased the xylanase topt value. when the domains were fused at other terminus, many enzyme activities were damaged  <cit> . the phenomenon is attributed to lack of linker-peptide. for example, the glucanases lost activities when fused at the other terminus  <cit> . to exclude the linker-peptide disturbance, we used the natural  <dig> residue linker-peptide to connect the glu and xyn. in addition, boundary determination is important for each domain to have complete residues. only a domain has complete residues, can it form to an active confirmation. in the meantime, we have to eliminate the extra residues encoded by unnecessary endo-nuclease sites in expression vectors. otherwise, the extra residues would disturb enzyme properties  <cit> . thereby, ndei and xhoi were used to delete the unnecessary endo-nuclease sites within the pet20b.

CONCLUSIONS
through the natural  <dig> residue linker-peptide, the mesophilic a. niger xyn was fused and swapped with the hyper-thermophilic t. maritima glu. after expression in e. coli, both chimeras exhibited bi-functional activities of xylanase and glucanase. especially, the xyn-glu xyn moiety had 3 °c higher topt and  <dig> -times higher thermostability than the xyn. in addition to the synergistic glucanase activity, the fungal xylanase was enhanced thermostability. the domain-swapping created different effects on each moiety. fusing the glu domain at c-terminus increased the xylanase thermostability, but fusing the glu domain at n-terminus decreased its thermostability. fusing the xyn domain at either terminus increased the glucanase thermostabilities, and fusing the xyn domain at c-terminus shifted the glucanase ph property  <dig> units higher towards alkaline environments. from the domain-swapping investigation, we can infer that a domain, especially a larger one, can only be fused at c-terminus to increase enzyme catalytic efficiency.
