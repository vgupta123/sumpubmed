BACKGROUND
plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria  increase the fitness and growth of host plants through various mechanisms, including biological nitrogen fixation, synthesis of plant hormones, solubilization of inorganic mineral phosphates, and siderophore production . many pgpr prevent colonization of the rhizosphere by pathogenic or parasitic organisms through both direct and indirect mechanisms. direct inhibition of pathogens typically involves secretion of antagonistic compounds and/or direct lysis mechanisms , while indirect mechanisms may include induction of plant defenses  <cit>  and/or competition for nutrients, such as iron, that are limited in the soil environment  <cit> . the gram-positive, sporulating, facultative anaerobic paenibacillus genus is comprised of over  <dig> species of which many act as important pgprs in agriculture and horticulture  <cit> . paenibacillus polymyxa is a well-studied pgpr and strains have been isolated from diverse geographic regions and ecological niches . p. polymyxa was originally identified and characterized as bacillus polymyxa as a result of its similarity to bacillus sp.  <cit> . p. polymyxa strains are best known for their production of various potent anti-microbial and volatile compounds that improve plant fitness through nutrient cycling, pathogen antagonism and induction of plant defenses . recent interest in the species has been driven by agribusiness and government initiatives for applications in bio-control, bio-fertilization and bio-fuel production  <cit> .

recently, our lab isolated p. polymyxa cr <dig>  from the rhizosphere of degrading corn stalks in southern ontario, canada. cr <dig> produces large amounts of indole-3-acetic acid  and excretes antagonistic compounds active against several plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi . additionally, cr <dig> was able to fix-nitrogen and promote the growth of a variety of crops. interestingly, cr <dig> metabolized lignin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose as a sole carbon source, and fermented these plant-derived compounds directly into alcoholic compounds . to better understand the relevant p. polymyxa cr <dig> metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the cr <dig> genome  <cit> . as of january  <dig>  four p. polymyxa genomes have been completely sequenced and annotated : p. polymyxa e <dig>  p. polymyxa m <dig>  p. polymyxa sc <dig>  and p. polymyxa cr <dig> .

e <dig>  isolated in korea from the rhizosphere of barley, was the first p. polymyxa strain to be completely sequenced. it promotes plant growth through production of indole-3-acetic acid ; and produces volatile compounds that elicit induced-systemic resistance in plants, priming the plant host defenses for a rapid response against pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . e <dig> has been investigated for various agricultural applications including microbial fertilization and bio-control activities against economically significant plant pathogens  <cit> . both m <dig> and sc <dig> were isolated in china from wheat roots and pepper rhizosphere respectively. all studied p. polymyxa strains possess various non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters encoding polymyxins, fusaricidins, paenicidins, gramicidins, bacitracins, polyketides, a bacilorin and a lantibiotic  <cit> . all strains of p. polymyxa are capable of strong growth antagonism of various bacterial and fungal plant pathogens and parasitic nematodes . furthermore, siderophores encoded by p. polymyxa increase plant-growth in iron-limited conditions by increasing iron availability for the associated plant host and decreasing iron availability for pathogenic organisms  <cit> .

as a major feature of the post-genomic era in biology, comparative genomics is recognized as an important tool for identifying and dissecting key metabolic pathways and regulatory networks amongst related organisms . these analyses provide insights into genetic features that have been acquired, modified, or lost during adaptation to specific environmental niches . in particular, in silico comparisons and analyses of taxonomically related bacterial species allows for rapid identification of functional similarities and unique genetic elements, uncovering complicated metabolic pathways and regulatory networks in the process . despite its potential importance in agriculture and industry, no comparative genomic studies have been completed for p. polymyxa. limited information is available regarding the specific adaptations and mechanisms that allow for their survival and growth in the soil environment.

here we perform detailed comparative genome analyses of the four sequenced p. polymyxa strains. the genomes of each strain were screened for the presence of loci associated with plant growth promotion and disease control. we also compared genomic regions implicated in metabolic versatility and association with plant hosts. these comparative genomic analyses have expanded our understanding of p. polymyxa biology and highlighted the gap in our current understanding of biomass metabolism pathways in gram-positive bacteria. this work will provide a foundation for follow-up studies of target genes and functions and will facilitate genetic and metabolic engineering of p. polymyxa to improve agricultural and industrial applications.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses
a phylogenetic tree was generated based on the 16s rrna of completely sequenced paenibacillus sp. using the maximum-likelihood method  <cit>  in mega <dig>  <cit>  . to support the obtained 16s rrna phylogeny, a whole-genome neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was generated using the dnadist and neighbour packages in phylip and visualized using phyloxml . on the basis of a 16s rdna phylogeny, cr <dig> and e <dig> form their own clade while m <dig> and sc <dig> form a separate clade. however, when the whole genome is used to compute the phylogeny, cr <dig> and e <dig> are no longer in the same clade. our results suggest p. polymyxa is most distantly related to paenibacillus mucilaginosus, which is currently employed in microbial fertilizers  <cit> , while being most closely related to paenibacillus terrae, a diazotrophic, free-living soil bacterium.figure  <dig>

general genomic features
general features of the four completely sequenced paenibacillus polymyxa genomes are presented in table  <dig>  immediately evident is the variation in genome size and differences in plasmid content amongst the strains, with no plasmids present in cr <dig> or e <dig>  genome size varies between  <dig>  mb in e <dig> to  <dig>  mb in cr <dig> excluding plasmids, with chromosome coding dna sequences  varying between  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the mean g + c mol% of the species is  <dig> % and no strain deviates from the mean by > <dig> %. the plasmids of sc <dig> and m <dig> have a lower g + c mol% in accordance with previously reported research  <cit> . with the inclusion of plasmids in the calculation, sc <dig> has the largest genome and the most cds  with m <dig> in a close second in terms of size, albeit with significantly fewer cds . this difference of  <dig> cds between m <dig> and sc <dig> is remarkable considering the genome size only varies by approximately 10 kb between the two strains . the differences in cds between m <dig> and sc <dig> is likely the result of different annotation methods employed, which can result in large discrepancies in the total number of genes identified in a genome  <cit> . despite the absence of a plasmid, cr <dig> has a large genome size , likely resulting from the large number of horizontally acquired genes presented later.table  <dig>

conservation of genome architecture
a global alignment of cr <dig>  e <dig>  m <dig> and sc <dig> chromosomes was performed using progressivemauve and visualized as local collinear blocks  to glean global information into the nucleotide level similarity amongst the sequenced p. polymyxa genomes . the nucleotide level similarity between m <dig> and sc <dig> is markedly higher than the similarity between any other grouping of strains , demonstrating the close relationship of these two strains. furthermore, the close relationship between the chromosomes of m <dig> and sc <dig> versus the more distant cr <dig> and e <dig> at the nucleotide level becomes evident, supporting our phylogeny showing the m <dig> and sc <dig> strains forming a sub-clade within the p. polymyxa species . also readily apparent is dissimilarity of the cr <dig> chromosome compared to any other combination of strains, with many strain-specific, low-similarity regions dispersed throughout the cr <dig> genome , which are discussed later.figure  <dig>

strains. the local collinear block  plot was generated using the progressivemauve algorithm using default parameters. the name of the strain represented is listed below each lcb plot. global alignments are visualized as lcbs, which represent regions of chromosomal similarity among strains. six lcbs were identified in the four p. polymyxa strains genomes and are coloured according to homology to lcbs of other strains. regions without colour both within and between lcbs represent the presence of strain-specific sequence. lcbs drawn below the horizontal correspond to inversions.



plasmid encoded genes
although m <dig> and sc <dig> show a high level of similarity ), comparison of the m <dig> and sc <dig> plasmids at a nucleotide level reveals an absence of homology . in the case of the pm <dig>  93% of cds were identified as strain-specific, while 98% of psc <dig> cds were identified as strain-specific. interestingly, the conserved cds of pm <dig> match genes encoded by e <dig> and cr <dig>  and not genes encoded by psc <dig>  suggesting the plasmids are unrelated to each other. notably, pm <dig> encodes an operon homologous to pyoverdine synthesis genes of fluorescent pseudomonads  <cit> . due to the limitations of annotation pipelines, the majority of genes encoded by psc <dig> are annotated as hypothetical genes with no conclusive function or experimentally characterized homologs. however, various genes are annotated as metal-dependent hydrolases suggesting sc <dig> may be dependent on plasmid encoded genes for scavenging nutrients during growth in nutrient-limited conditions. the low homology at the protein and nucleotide levels in conjunction with the large difference in size and number of cds encoded by pm <dig> and psc <dig>  suggests that these two plasmids were recently obtained by an ancestral p. polymyxa progenitor strain independently from each other. this notion is further supported when considering the high level of similarity between the core chromosomes of m <dig> and sc <dig> . to identify potential ancestral sources of the plasmids, we performed an iterative tblastx of the plasmids against the ncbi nucleotide database, which yielded no homology to any known bacterial species or sequenced plasmids .figure  <dig>

plasmids pm <dig> and psc <dig>  the local collinear block  plot was generated using the progressivemauve algorithm using default parameters. the plasmid visualized is listed below each respective lcb plot. global alignments are visualized as lcbs, which represent regions of chromosomal similarity between strains. five very short and dispersed lcbs were identified between the two plasmids and regions with the same colour represent homologous lcbs in the other plasmid. regions without colour both within and between local collinear blocks represent presence of strain-specific sequence. local collinear blocks drawn below the horizontal correspond to inversions. comparison of pm <dig> and psc <dig> versus their own respective genomes and the genomes of other strains yielded no lcbs and is thus omitted.



functional categorization of the p. polymyxagenomes
comparative analyses of protein function from genomic sequence data of less heavily studied taxonomic families, such as paenibacillacae, are limited by the availability of in-depth experimental data of closely related homologs. the clusters of orthologous groups  categories r and s represent general function prediction and unknown function, respectively, and offer minimal evidence of the substrate specificity and/or protein function of the annotated protein. as evidenced by the large proportion of genes assigned to the cog categories r and s, protein function in the paenibacillus genus is not well characterized. regardless of the limitations of available data sets and analytical tools, some important inferences into the metabolic capacities of each strain are still possible. the proportion of genes assigned to each cog is presented in figure  <dig> to visualize the functional differences between each genome. the cogs a, b, w and y correspond to eukaryotic functions and thus do not contain any proteins from p. polymyxa strains and are omitted . both the cr <dig> and e <dig> genomes have a higher proportion of encoded genes dedicated to energy metabolism and inorganic transport and metabolism , compared to m <dig> and sc <dig>  the similarity at the nucleotide, protein and functional levels between m <dig> and sc <dig> versus e <dig> and cr <dig> suggests the two sub-groups diverged and the m1/sc <dig> ancestor developed into two separate strains after independently obtaining unique plasmids. conversely, the most recent common ancestor of cr1/e <dig> likely diverged into each strain earlier giving more opportunities to develop the unique differences unique to each respective strain .figure  <dig>

strain-specific genes
whole genome alignments of protein coding sequences of the four p. polymyxa strains were conducted to visualize the similarity of encoded proteins. average amino acid identities were calculated using the pair-wise orthologous sets of cdss from the four p. polymyxa genomes. the accessory and core genomes were identified by an in silico subtractive hybridization approach using mgenomesubtractor  <cit>  . homology values  are defined as an arbitrary unit measuring the degree of similarity between a single protein coding sequence from the reference set and all proteins contained within the user defined subject sets. for purposes of this study we defined the subject sets as all completely sequenced p. polymyxa strains and their respective plasmids. h-values < <dig>  were considered strain-specific while those > <dig>  were considered conserved, representing approximate amino acid level similarity cut-offs of <41% and >81% respectively. when chromosomes and plasmids are considered together all strains contain between 9% and 18% strain-specific cds. the largest number of strain-specific genes is encoded by cr <dig> where  <dig> cds were identified as strain-specific , surprising when considering its genome size and absence of a plasmid . interestingly, even with its comparatively small genome size of  <dig>  mb, e <dig> contained a total of  <dig> strain-specific cds. despite an approximately 10 kb difference in total genome size sc <dig> contained  <dig> strain-specific cds while m <dig> contained only  <dig> strain-specific cds. the chromosomes of strains m <dig> and sc <dig> contain very few strain-specific coding sequences, with approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their chromosome encoded cds  being strain specific on a protein level, respectively . nevertheless, these unique strain-specific cds may confer some unidentified advantage to the bacterium that allows it to adapt to changing environmental conditions. further study will be needed to determine the ecological significance of the identified strain-specific genes.

horizontally transferred genes
foreign dna acquired by horizontal gene transfer  is commonly associated with insertion sequence  elements, trna genes, tmrna genes and transposons and is identified by an anomalous gc content, codon bias, di/trinucleotide differences and gc skew  <cit> . to visualize the general structure of completely sequenced p. polymyxa genomes, plus and minus strand cds, rna genes, transposons, phage related genes, insertion elements, potential horizontally transferred loci and strain-specific genes were annotated in artemis  <cit>  and plotted using dnaplotter  <cit>  . putative hgt events were identified using islandviewer  <dig>   <cit> , which scans the target genome for perturbations in the average gc content using a hidden markov model  <cit> . although robust, this method omits potential hgt between bacteria with a similar g + c content. notably, the variation observed earlier among p. polymyxa strains  appears to be largely generated through hgt events, as most strain-specific genes correspond to putative hgt loci.figure  <dig>

genomic islands  are thought to be genetic elements acquired during evolution from distantly related organisms and such horizontally transferred genes contribute to genome flux and variation  <cit> . initially identified and established as important mediators of virulence in pathogenic bacteria, gis were subsequently identified in non-pathogenic bacteria from niches such as the rhizosphere  <cit> . many gis encode traits that enhance bacterial fitness including iron-uptake systems, polyketide synthesis clusters, resistance cassettes, symbiosis genes, xenobiotic compound degradation and primary metabolism pathways  <cit> . the locations of identified genomic islands and their encoded genes are provided in additional file  <dig>  the majority of cds in the identified genomic islands are annotated as hypothetical genes although many genomic islands include antibiotic synthesis and resistance genes. some of the most interesting features encoded within identified genomic islands include a bacitracin synthase in e <dig> and cr <dig>  bacillorin and β-lactamase in sc <dig>  multidrug efflux pumps and sugar hydrolases in m <dig>  as well as a minimal nif cluster in cr <dig>  in addition, insertion sequences were identified using is finder  <cit>   and their genome locations are provided in additional file  <dig>  the p. polymyxa strains harbour between  <dig> and  <dig> is elements, and between  <dig> and  <dig> transposase containing genomic islands . a large number of transposons, insertion elements, prophages and tandem repeats are contained within genomic islands suggesting p. polymyxa is a common phage target. the plasmids pm <dig> and psc <dig> were visualized using the same method described above . since the majority of genes encoded by the plasmids have unknown functions only plus and minus strand cds, strain-specific genes and trna genes are presented.figure  <dig>

plant growth promoting traits
the majority of genes involved in plant-growth promotion and plant-derived compound metabolism were highly conserved amongst p. polymyxa strains . these include genes responsible for indole-3-acetic acid production, mineral phosphate and phosphonate solubilization, and synthesis of specific antimicrobial non-ribosomal peptides. this is expected as the association of the species with the rhizosphere and endophytic niches are well-documented . notably, presence of genes responsible for nitrogen fixation , carbohydrate hydrolases  and bio-control compounds  varied between strains. these traits have potential applications for sustainable agricultural and environmental processes aimed at reducing dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which are discussed in the follow sections.table  <dig>

biological nitrogen fixation
nitrogen is a critical limiting element for plant growth and production in agricultural systems, since plants are only capable of incorporating reduced forms of nitrogen   <cit> . nitrogenase, an oxygen sensitive dinitrogen reductase encoded by certain microorganisms converts inert atmospheric nitrogen  into ammonium  thereby improving plant growth and crop yields by increasing the concentration of biologically available nitrogen  <cit> . recent research on paenibacillus sp. wly <dig> has demonstrated that a minimal nif cluster can confer nitrogen fixation to escherichia coli
 <cit> . in this study, a minimal nif cluster was identified only in cr <dig> but not the other three p. polymyxa genomes. the gene organization and composition of the cr <dig> nif cluster was identical to the previously identified nif cluster of wly <dig>  <cit> . the entire nif cluster of cr <dig> is approximately  <dig>  kb and encodes  <dig> genes; nifb, nifh, nifd, nifk, nife, nifn, nifx, hesa, and nifv . the nifhdk genes encode a mo-nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for fixing-nitrogen, while nifbenx and nifv are responsible for the synthesis and maturation of the femo-cofactor. the gene hesa encodes a nad/fad-binding protein involved in molybdopterin and thiamine biosynthesis. interestingly, the identified nif gene cluster has higher g + c mol% content  than the rest of p. polymyxa genome  and the nif cluster was identified as a gi by islandviewer , suggesting this nif cluster may originate from a distantly-related higher g + c content bacterial species. however, comparison of the minimal nif cluster of cr <dig> with available genomic data on the joint genome institute integrated microbial genomics database  <cit>  and ncbi genebank databases did not reveal a potential source of the nif cluster. however, an identical nif cluster  was also identified in paenibacillus terrae hpl- <dig>  <cit> , the next closest related paenibacillacae to the p. polymyxa species . therefore, we speculate that p. polymyxa and p. terrae are likely derived from the same ancestor possessing the nif cluster, which would explain the identical cluster organization and high nucleotide level similarity between the cr <dig> and hpl- <dig> nif clusters . the whole genome phylogeny  taken in concert with the presence of the nif cluster in p. terrae hpl- <dig>  suggests that the ancestor of p. polymyxa strains encoded the nif cluster which was subsequently lost in the e681/m1/sc <dig> strains.

unlike free-living gram-negative nitrogen fixing bacteria such as gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus
 <cit> , there is no nifa gene in paenibacillus sp. or other gram-positive, diazotrophs such as clostridium sp. the nifa gene encodes a nif-specific regulatory protein that activates the expression of nifhdk genes  <cit> . in the n2-fixing alfalfa symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti, the three sigma- <dig> type ntra-dependent regulatory proteins nifa, ntrc, and dctd are required for activation of promoters involved in n2-fixation , nitrogen assimilation , and c4-dicarboxylate transport  respectively  <cit> . previous experiments revealed that the nifa gene is dispensable for n2-fixation since a mutation in ntrc <dig> allele in s. meliloti restores the n2-fixation ability of a nifa deletion mutant to 70-80% of the wild-type level  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the ntrc homolog encoded by cr <dig>  activates expression of the nif gene cluster. the other three p. polymyxa strains do not contain the ntrc homolog found in cr <dig>  consistent with the absence of the nif gene cluster in these three strains. however, it is unclear how these three p. polymyxa strains  handle nitrogen assimilation.

in rhizobia, dctd, a c4-dicarboxylate response regulator, activates the expression of dcta upon detection of c4-dicarboxylates. previous studies have found that dctd is not only involved in c <dig> uptake, but also participates in symbiotic nitrogen fixation through complex signalling mechanisms  <cit> . interestingly, our analysis also revealed a dctd homolog in the cr <dig> genome, which matched to the same protein identified as an ntrc homolog . these results suggest that cr <dig> maintained the nif cluster and a hybrid ntrc/dctd response regulator required for nitrogen fixation. conversely the absence of ntrc and dctd gene homologs in the other p. polymyxa strains is unsurprising since these strains lack the nif cluster and do not require their associated signalling pathways. in the case of a recent study that demonstrated escherichia coli nitrogen fixation by acquisition of the nif cluster from paenibacillus sp. wly <dig>  <cit> , it is plausible that the ntrc homolog in e. coli partially activates expression of the exogenous nif cluster. nevertheless, the  <dig> gene nif cluster identified in cr <dig> is particularly exciting for its potential use as a transferable nitrogen fixation genetic element to facilitate development of genetically modified plant-growth promoting bacteria. the broad host-range and free-living lifestyle of p. polymyxa coupled with the ability to fix nitrogen is in stark contrast to rhizobia sp. which require nodule organogenesis  prior to induction of diazotrophy  <cit> .

iaa production
a major mechanism employed by pgpr to enhance plant growth is the production of various plant hormones including auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins, or other factors that modulate plant regulatory systems . indole-3-acetic acid  is the primary auxin endogenously synthesized by plant-associated bacteria and has a profound effect on plant growth and development. auxins produced by plant-associated bacteria typically induce root branching and elongation in the plant hosts, thereby enhancing plant fitness/growth, and thus increasing available plant derived nutrients for the bacteria in return. we compared the sequenced p. polymyxa genomes for pathways involved in the production of iaa. indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase  is a key enzyme involved in the ipa pathway and is encoded by the ipdc gene, which has been established as necessary for the production of iaa in e <dig>  <cit> . highly similar genes  are present in m <dig>  sc <dig> and cr <dig> . however, genes encoding tryptophan-2-monooxygenase and indole-3-acetamide hydrolase, which convert tryptophan to iaa via the two-step indole-3-acetamide pathway, were not detected in the four genomes. this suggests the indole-3-pyurvatic acid  pathway is the sole iaa production mechanism employed by p. polymyxa. preliminary results in our lab corroborated the capacity to produce iaa by the ipa pathway in cr <dig> . furthermore, all genomes examined here encode putative auxin efflux carrier proteins, suggesting that these bacteria are capable of production and export of iaa in a tryptophan-dependent manner . however, our data suggests cr <dig> may also be able to produce iaa in a tryptophan-independent manner, which has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. since cr <dig> is a tryptophan prototroph, further experiments are needed to control for iaa production from endogenous tryptophan obtained either through de novo synthesis or protein catabolism. research is inconclusive on the production of cytokinins and gibberellins in p. polymyxa and if the produced amounts have a physiological effect on plants  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge no characterization of genes responsible for cytokinin and gibberellin production has been performed in any closely related species.

aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  is the immediate precursor of the plant hormone ethylene. stressed plants accumulate ethylene, which inhibits root elongation and accelerates abscission, aging and senescence. acc deaminase-producing rhizobacteria lower plant ethylene levels by converting acc into ammonia and α-ketobutyrate, preventing inhibition of root growth thereby improving tolerance to environmental or pathogen-induced stress  <cit> . the acds gene encodes acc deaminase, however no acds homologs were identified amongst the four sequenced strains.

phosphate solubilization and assimilation
phosphate is a major limiting nutrient in soils and a large proportion of phosphate in soils is sequestered in mineral compounds  <cit> . solubilization of mineral phosphates by bacteria is typically achieved through gluconic acid production. previous research in various pseudomonas sp. have implicated glucose-1-dehydrogenase  and gluconic acid dehydrogenase  in the production of gluconic acid and its conversion to 2-ketogluconate respectively  <cit> . the lowered ph resulting from the secretion of gluconic acid results in formation of phosphorylated gluconate, which in turn is up taken by sugar-specific transporters. our characterization demonstrated cr <dig> is capable of solubilizing inorganic mineral phosphates thereby increasing phosphate availability for the plant host . in this study, we identified putative genes encoding glucose-1-dehydrogenase and gluconic acid dehydrogenase in all sequenced p. polymyxa genomes , suggesting that phosphate solubilization is likely mediated through gluconic acid secretion, and that all strains are capable of solubilizing mineral phosphates.

another rich source of soil phosphate is trapped in the form of phosphonate, an organophosphorus compound that must be degraded prior to biological incorporation. the phosphonate gene cluster  is responsible for bacterial degradation of phosphonates, which releases biologically available phosphate for nearby plants. our comparative genomics revealed that p. polymyxa strains do not carry the complete phn cluster, lacking the genes encoding a c-p lyase protein  responsible for phosphonate degradation into phosphate and an alkane, a system commonly identified in other phosphonate degrading bacteria . all p. polymyxa strains appear to possess the capability to degrade phosphonoacetaldehyde and phosphonoacetate . in addition, cr <dig> and e <dig> also possess the necessary genes  for 2-aminoethylphosphonate and phosphonopyruvate degradation. furthermore, cr <dig> and e <dig> encode phnw, required for the biosynthesis of phosphonates, possibly utilizing produced phosphonates as a sequestered storage form of phosphate .

antimicrobial compound production
bacteria often produce antimicrobial peptides and proteins called bacteriocins to suppress surrounding bacteria to gain a colonization advantage over competing bacteria. enzymes responsible for synthesis of non-ribosomal peptides  and polyketides  are modular in nature and are comprised of a multitude of possible modification domains including adenylation, condensation, thiolation and esterification domains. the most well-known nrps produced by p. polymyxa are polymyxin b/e, which are used in over-the-counter antimicrobial ointments and renewed applications as a last resort antibiotic against multiple drug resistant bacteria  <cit> . there is evidence p. polymyxa co-produces nrps, presumably as an aggressive defense response against potentially hostile bacteria  <cit> . recent research has shown that antimicrobial compounds produced by paenibacillus sp. target a variety of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria and fungi .

our analyses identified a large number of heterogeneous nrp, pk and hybrid nrp-pk synthase modules in the genomes of p. polymyxa strains, which are summarized in figure  <dig> . however, all p. polymyxa strains do not possess identical clusters of nrp and pk synthesis genes, likely representing adaptations by strains to their specific ecological niche and the organisms it competes with. notably, each strain has an impressive repertoire of strain specific nrp, pk and nrp-pk hybrid synthases. for example, cr <dig> encodes a staphyloferrin-like-siderophore synthetase, tyrocidine synthetase, a type ii polyketide synthase, a type i polyketide synthase and a novel nrp-pk hybrid synthase not found in other bacteria. meanwhile, e <dig> encodes a novel gramicidin-like synthase, and a nrp-pk hybrid synthase also found in sc <dig>  m <dig> encodes fuscaricidin synthase, two nrps, lichenysin and a lantibiotic otherwise found only in sc <dig> as well as a plasmid encoded nrp and pyroverdine siderophore. finally, sc <dig> encodes gramicidin, two nrps and a lantibiotic otherwise found only in m <dig> and a nrp-pk hybrid also found in e <dig> .

iron acts as a co-factor and electron acceptor in various essential enzymes and proteins and is an important nutrient to organisms. siderophores are low molecular weight, ferric ion-specific chelating agents, synthesized by microorganisms growing in iron limited environments  <cit> . plant-growth promoting bacteria use nrp synthases to produce siderophores responsible for scavenging heme and non-heme iron from the rhizosphere, increasing its availability for associated plant hosts  <cit> . once iron is depleted in the surrounding environment, other microorganisms that do not produce siderophores cannot obtain necessary iron and are growth inhibited. therefore, siderophore production can act as an antagonistic mechanism by scavenging scarce iron from the soil environment. our comparative analysis revealed that only cr <dig> and m <dig> encode siderophore synthesis clusters. the siderophore synthesis cluster of cr <dig> shows homology to a siderophore synthesis cluster of staphylococcus aureus, a heavily studied human pathogen. interestingly, the siderophore synthesis genes are encoded by m <dig> on its plasmid and show homology to pyoverdine synthesis genes of fluorescent pseudomonads, suggesting siderophore synthesis genes in p. polymyxa are obtained by horizontal gene transfer events. our comparative genomic analyses reveals p. polymyxa strains sc <dig> and e <dig> do not encode any canonical siderophore nrp synthetase clusters. therefore, e <dig> and sc <dig> either cannot accumulate iron or obtain iron through yet unidentified mechanisms.

biomass degradation and bioproduct formation
bacteria that form commensal or mutualistic relationships with plants are at a selective advantage if they can metabolize plant-derived carbon sources, which are enriched in the rhizosphere environment  <cit> . therefore, understanding the bacterial metabolic network is crucial in understanding complex plant-bacterium interactions. the complexity of the p. polymyxa metabolic network is reflected by the ability to metabolize lignin or cellulose as a sole carbon source, which aids survival in diverse environments and allows for colonization of a variety of plant species. recent biofuel technologies are limited by the availability of highly active hydrolytic enzymes that mediate the degradation of complex plant polymers  <cit> . our initial characterization revealed cr <dig> is capable of growth using various plant-derived carbon sources including lignin, cellulose and hemi-celluloses . since highly active hydrolytic enzymes and bacterial strains are a desirable commodity in the developing biofuel sector we compared the quantity and nature of glycoside hydrolases  amongst p. polymyxa strains to glean an overall outlook of the strain-specific biomass degradation capacity . we found all strains of completely sequenced p. polymyxa encode a large number of various gh family proteins with cr <dig> encoding the largest repertoire of gh family proteins , followed by m <dig> . cr <dig> encodes an increased quantity of gh families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins  while showing a decreased number of gh family  <dig>  proteins. as a result of their increased number of cellulase domain containing enzymes, m <dig>  e <dig> and sc <dig> are also likely proficient cellulose degraders. interestingly, e <dig> encodes a large number of rhamnogalacturonan lyase and pectin lyase proteins, which are responsible for non-hydrolytic cleavage of pectin, possibly underpinning a previously unknown saprophytic niche occupied by e <dig> in soils. carbohydrate hydrolase enzymes function as complex, multi-meric proteins assembled from various numbers of encoded domains. this allows the substrate specificity of the complex to vary greatly dependant on the stoichiometry of the subunits  <cit> . it is therefore difficult to make conclusive arguments as to the degradation potential of each strain merely based on a bioinformatics approach. regardless, the large arsenal of gh domain enzymes makes p. polymyxa an untapped reservoir of potentially valuable hydrolytic enzymes and plant biomass degradation complexes. furthermore, the large quantity of gh family genes present in p. polymyxa genomes is consistent with the intimate association of p. polymyxa with plant hosts in the rhizosphere where there is an increased concentration of plant-derived compounds.

lignin metabolism by many actinomyces bacteria as well as various fungi occurs through non-specific redox and free-radical generating mechanisms. fungal laccase enzymes are copper-dependent hydrolases expressed by white and brown rot fungi that non-selectively depolymerize lignin through reduction-oxidation reactions . conversely, bacterial encoded dyp-family peroxidases have been shown to be capable of degrading phenolic dyes, whose structures mimic complex lignin polymers. notably, the genomes of all sequenced p. polymyxa contain putative dyp-peroxidase and laccase genes . recent research has suggested there are two subfamilies of dyp-peroxidase genes, the a subtype, capable of liberating iron from heme, while the b subtype possesses lignin degrading capacities. analyses of the putative dyp-peroxidases encoded by p. polymyxa using hhpred  <cit>  and phyre  <dig>  <cit>  suggests structural homology to the dyp type b peroxidase of rhodococcus jostii rha <dig>  that is responsible for non-specifically degrading lignin substrates  <cit> . furthermore, our preliminary data demonstrates cr <dig> decolours extracellular methylene and toluidine blue dyes, suggesting the dyp peroxidase is secreted and may be responsible for the lignin degrading phenotype. further experimental data will be needed to determine their respective functions and their applicability to industrial processes.table  <dig>

specific strains of p. polymyxa are noted for their ability to sterioselectively ferment valuable - <dig>  3-butanediol from monosaccharide feed stocks . preliminary data from our lab shows cr <dig> is capable of fermenting kraft lignin into a mixture of methylated and non-methylated short chain alcohol compounds . our attempts to characterize the lignin-degrading pathway by a computational approach are greatly limited by the lack of detailed studies of firmicutes lignin-degrading pathways. further studies are necessary for elucidating the responsible enzymes and regulatory networks. further complicating our analysis, our research suggests cr <dig> is incapable of degrading protocatechuate , a key nodal metabolite in currently characterized gram-negative lignin degradation pathways  <cit> . this is consistent with the lack of identified homologs for the protocatechuate cleavage pathway in all sequenced p. polymyxa strains, as determined using ko classification and blastx searches of characterized genes  from characterized species. therefore, p. polymyxa likely utilizes a yet to be characterized lignin and aromatic degradation pathway and to the best of our knowledge no complete characterization of the lignin metabolism network has taken place in any firmicutes bacteria.figure  <dig>

regulatory network and stress response
in variable and changing environments bacteria with larger genomes encoding varied metabolic capabilities have a long-term selective advantage  <cit> . the soil environment is heterogeneous with an irregular distribution of a variety of substrates, nutrients, antagonistic compounds and potential stressors. accordingly, many soil-dwelling, plant-associated bacteria have relatively large genomes, presumably to allow the bacterium to survive in such a variable environment  <cit> . soil bacteria coordinate multicellular behavioural responses to integrate environmental cues through complex regulatory networks. consistent with this premise, p. polymyxa encodes a large number of transporters and regulators allowing a wide range of substrates to be up taken. bacterial two-component signal transduction systems play important roles in enabling detection and response to diverse changes/stresses in the environment  <cit> . the b. subtilis degs/degu two component system is involved in the regulation of post-exponential phase processes, including activation of genetic competence, motility, poly-γ-glutamic acid production and biofilm formation  <cit> . during the transition from exponential to stationary growth, b. subtilis produces several proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes including an intracellular protease and several secreted enzymes , and xylanase), which are controlled at the transcriptional level by the degs/degu two-component system. to understand how p. polymyxa co-ordinates the decision-making processes to ensure appropriate physiological responses occur during different environmental conditions, we attempted to identify a p. polymyxa degs/degu two-component system. our analysis at the genome level indicates that a conserved degs  and degu  are present among the sequenced p. polymyxa genomes . however, without experimental evidence, we can only speculate the identified two-component system degs/degu participates in biomass degradation and provides a selective advantage to p. polymyxa.

motility is a fundamental process employed by many bacteria during adaptation to environmental changes and stresses. chemotactic pathways governed by two-component regulatory systems in response to specific signals are mediated through methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins . the repertoire of chemotactic signal pathways of a microorganism is correlated to the environments it inhabits and the hosts it colonizes  <cit> . many bacilli, including p. polymyxa, also encode anti-sigma-factors  or anti-anti-σ-factors that are secreted either as a mechanism of competition with other bacteria or to control their own gene expression in rapidly changing environments where tight gene regulation is paramount. strikingly, all strains of p. polymyxa encode a large number of σ-factors and mcps . in particular, all p. polymyxa strains contain a full complement of σ-factors related to spore formation, corroborating our experimental evidence of the propensity of cr <dig> to form spores in nutrient limited conditions . as expected, rpod, sige, rpon and flia are encoded by all strains, representing σ-factors responsible for basal transcription, general stress responses, nitrogen limitation and flagella assembly respectively. in addition to necessary basal transcription factors, each strain encodes a variable amount anti-σ-factors and anti-anti-σ-factors, which may be involved in sensing environmental conditions and modulating gene expression accordingly . m <dig> encodes  <dig> extracellular σ-factors, slightly more than sc <dig>  which encodes  <dig>  cr <dig> encodes  <dig> extracellular σ-factors, while e <dig> encodes the fewest with only  <dig> extracellular σ-factors. unexpectedly, e <dig> encodes  <dig> mcps despite having the smallest genome and fewest σ-factors, suggesting e <dig> prefers to migrate to higher nutrient environments as opposed to tight genetic control in nutrient limited conditions. both sc <dig> and m <dig> encode  <dig> mcps molecules while cr <dig> encodes only  <dig>  the abundance of predicted mcps and σ-factors indicates an elaborate sensing capability of p. polymyxa that presumably allows the bacterium to survive in different ecological niches.

quorum sensing
quorum sensing  is a specialized cell-to-cell communication mechanism employed by bacteria to control gene expression on a community level through secretion and detection of extracellular signalling molecules, called autoinducers, which accumulate in the environment proportional to cellular density  <cit> . qs-controlled behaviours include bioluminescence, biofilm formation, virulence, antimicrobial compound production and competence . the complex role of quorum sensing in the p. polymyxa lifestyle has not yet been revealed so far, however, other members of the genus are known for intricate signalling pathways and striking patterns formed during migration  <cit> . the comqxpa system of b. subtilis is a typical gram-positive qs system that controls bacterial competence  <cit> . however, our genomic analysis reveals no homologs of comqxpa genes in the p. polymyxa genomes, which may explain the low transformation frequency of cr <dig> compared to b. subtilis . in addition to comqxpa, b. subtilis operates a luxs-dependent qs system that regulates its morphogenesis and social behaviour  <cit> . the luxs gene product synthesizes autoinducer- <dig>  that modulates biofilm formation. expression of luxs is negatively regulated by two master regulatory proteins, sinr and spo0a. sinr is a key regulator for proper biofilm development and spo0a controls sporulation in b. subtilis
 <cit> . our comparative genomics revealed a conserved luxs gene homolog among the fully sequenced p. polymyxa genomes . in vibrio harveyi, two proteins, luxp and luxq, function together as the ai- <dig> sensor. luxp is a periplasmic binding protein, and luxq is a hybrid two-component protein that contains both a sensor kinase and response regulator domain  <cit> . however, genomic analyses did not identify a luxp homolog among these sequenced p polymyxa genomes, instead, a conserved luxq homolog was found within the p. polymyxa genomes . therefore, it is plausible that in these p. polymyxa strains, luxs is the main qs signal producer, whereas, the hybrid two-component protein luxq plays a major role as a sensor kinase and response regulator for the luxs-dependent qs amongst strains of the species.figure  <dig>

transport mechanisms
soil bacteria are known to be rich in atp-binding cassette  transporters. p. polymyxa is typically found either in association with plant hosts or as free-living in the rhizosphere and is expected to encode diverse metabolic networks and transporters to adapt to the specialized living environments  <cit> . to gain insights into the potential metabolic pathways we compared encoded transporter families and their specificities amongst sequenced p. polymyxa genomes . cr <dig> encodes both a larger absolute number and proportion of abc-transporters relative to genome size , possibly reflecting the difference in ecological niches available to the geographically isolated strains. all genomes were found to encode transporters involved in auxin efflux ; giving further evidence to support the identification of putative iaa production genes in all p. polymyxa strains . notably, all p. polymyxa strains encode a pstscab system , a high-affinity, high-velocity phosphate specific transport system  <cit>  suggesting p. polymyxa possess a strong capability for phosphate uptake from the environment. a large number of phospho-transferase transporters of the glucose-glucoside family are encoded by all strains. this family of transporters mediates the intake of simple sugars offering a simple transport mechanism for plant derived sugars. in addition to the multitude of simple sugar transport systems, all genomes of p. polymyxa encode various transporters involved in the uptake of cellobiose, arabinose, chitobiose and various other plant derived compounds, corroborating the capability of cr <dig> to degrade and utilize complex plant-derived compounds . as expected, abc transporters responsible for export of bacteriocins and other nrps and pks are encoded by all strains. in addition, our comparative genomic analysis found all p. polymyxa genomes encode a c4-dicarboxylate transporter  , reminiscent of rhizobia sp. where dicarboxylic acids  are major carbon and energy sources for the symbiotic bacteria  <cit> . in rhizobia, dctd, a c4-dicarboxylate response regulator, activates the expression of dcta upon detection of c4-dicarboxylates. our comparative genomic analysis revealed a dctd homolog in cr <dig> genome , which is absent in the other three p. polymyxa genomes.figure  <dig>

consistent with other gram-positive bacteria, all four p. polymyxa genomes encode complete twin-arginine translocation and sec systems for protein secretion. interestingly, all p. polymyxa genomes analyzed here appear to encode various genes responsible for type  <dig> secretion systems , however due to the similarity between flagella structures and t3ss structures, it is plausible these genes are actually involved in flagella structure, transport and function .

CONCLUSIONS
through detailed comparative analyses we present a global overview of the four completely sequenced p. polymyxa genomes and their respective transporters, metabolic pathways, environmental responses, plant-growth promotion traits, biomass degradation, bio-control and bio-product synthesis pathways . despite their geographical isolation and varied plant hosts, the majority of genes implicated in plant association and competitiveness were highly conserved amongst p. polymyxa strains. in particular, genes responsible for iaa production, phosphate/phosphonate solubilization, plant cell wall degradation, carbon metabolism and antimicrobial compound production were largely conserved amongst these strains . comparative genomic analyses also identified large numbers of regulatory elements that presumably confer the ability to adapt to diverse environmental cues. in particular, we identified a putative luxs-dependent quorum sensing system and two possible mechanisms by which p. polymyxa senses and adapts to dynamic environmental conditions, σ-factor mediated stress response versus a mcp-mediated chemotactic response.

not surprisingly minor genome variation exists among p. polymyxa strains, as evidenced by the presence of plasmids in m <dig> and sc <dig>  irregular distribution of strain-specific loci and horizontally transferred genes. notably, a minimal  <dig> gene nif cluster identified in p. polymyxa cr <dig> is absent in m <dig>  sc <dig> or e <dig> . given the broad host-range of p. polymyxa cr <dig> coupled with a free-living, nitrogen fixation capability, the strain may be developed as a crop inoculant to enhance nitrogen availability. in addition, the nif cluster and its regulatory factors may also be developed as a transferable bio-reactor for nitrogen fertilization.

our study provides new insights into the biology and genome structure of p. polymyxa. our results suggest that the investigated p. polymyxa strains have acquired various traits through horizontal gene transfer events. the wide host and geographic range of p. polymyxa indicates its intimate relation with host plants and niches, which is consistent with their complex regulatory networks and metabolic versatility. plant-growth promoting traits identified here offer a framework for further development of p. polymyxa strains for agricultural and industrial applications. knowledge generated from this study will also aid future genetic and metabolic engineering efforts in p. polymyxa to enhance their performance in sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy programs.
