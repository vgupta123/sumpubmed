BACKGROUND
vertebrate vision in both bright-light  and dim-light  conditions occurs following the absorbance of light by a chromophore  attached to a visual pigment protein  within retinal photoreceptor cells . opsin proteins are a subgroup of g-protein coupled receptors  with a seven transmembrane domain spanning the photoreceptor outer segment membrane. changes in amino acids surrounding the binding pocket of the light-sensitive chromophore of the opsin can directly alter the spectral sensitivity of the visual pigment. opsins arise from paralogous opsin genes, and the resulting visual pigments maximally absorb light from different parts of the spectrum from uv to near infrared . species from most vertebrate classes possess one or more of a total of five opsin genes; rh <dig> , rh <dig> , lws , sws <dig> , and sws <dig> . the persistence, loss or duplication of these opsin genes reflects the spectral environment and visual needs of a species  <cit> . while the opsin complement has been well studied in a number of aquatic and terrestrial species  <cit> , there remain large gaps in our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate opsins, particularly among species representing the period prior to the transition onto land such as the sarcopterygian, or lobe-finned fish.

sarcopterygian fish gave rise to the first tetrapods and are represented today by the lungfishes , and the coelacanth, latimeria chalumnae. the relationship between all early sarcopterygii remains controversial and highly debated despite the advent of phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences  <cit> . some molecular analyses of sarcopterygian phylogeny reveal that the lungfish is more related to tetrapods than to the coelacanth, l. chalumnae  <cit> , while others present an unresolved trichotomy between all three groups  <cit> . fossil forms of the lungfish family ceratodontidae  first appear in the fossil record in the triassic period . the genus neoceratodus  is found in the fossil record from the lower cretaceous period  <dig> million years ago  and therefore n. forsteri lays claim to being the oldest surviving vertebrate genus  <cit> . consequently, the visual system of n. forsteri may represent an evolutionary design most closely reflecting that present just prior to the emergence of land vertebrates in the devonian period.

the australian lungfish neoceratodus forsteri was thought to have poor eyesight due to its small eye size, low spatial resolving power  <cit> , sluggish behaviour in captivity  <cit>  and ability to detect prey using electroreception  <cit> . however, recent work on the retina of n. forsteri has revealed four morphologically-distinct photoreceptor types , some containing colored intracellular filters that are otherwise only found in terrestrial orders  <cit> . although a partial sequence of the african lungfish protopterus spp. rh <dig> opsin gene has been previously published , nothing else is known about lungfish opsins. the other extant sarcopterygian fish, l. chalumnae, possesses only two functional opsin genes, rh <dig> and rh <dig> and lives in a photon-limited deep-sea environment  <cit> . conversely, n. forsteri inhabits a brightly lit, shallow freshwater habitat more similar to the environment from which terrestrial evolution occurred  <cit> . this prompted us to investigate the complement of opsins expressed in n. forsteri in order to trace the evolution of photoreception in ancestral tetrapods.

RESULTS
opsin mrna
we have characterised the full length cdna coding sequences of five visual opsin genes , one from each of the five image-forming vertebrate opsin groups, in n. forsteri. in addition, 3' race experiments reveal multiple transcripts of rh <dig> utilising different polyadenylation  signal sequences within the rh <dig> 3' untranslated region . all five opsins are expressed in the retina of sub-adult fish and the deduced amino acid  sequences yield polypeptides ranging in size between 351– <dig> aa's. lungfish opsins share highly conserved residues known to be important in visual pigment function such as a glutamate counterion at aa site  <dig>  and a lysine residue forming the chromophore binding site at aa site  <dig> 

more than ten independent clones  from at least two individual lungfish were sequenced for each opsin gene family and, while there was evidence of polymorphism in the gene pool  with a variation between clones of up to  <dig> %, there was no evidence for gene duplications in individuals. we therefore conclude that we did not sequence paralogous opsins within the five main vertebrate opsin groups in n. forsteri and that the lungfish genome encodes a single copy of each opsin gene. this is in contrast to opsin gene duplications in teleost fish. ray-finned fish  underwent a whole genome duplication event around  <dig> mya, after the divergence of the sarcopterygii, and many lineages of teleost fish are tetraploid , whereas n. forsteri is a diploid animal  <cit> . in addition, some species of teleost fish appear to have undergone multiple opsin gene duplications independently  <cit> . these have accumulated subsequent amino acid changes, resulting in differences in the maximum sensitivity of opsins. these opsins can then be preferentially expressed to fine-tune the animal's spectral sensitivity to environmental light, thus reflecting a degree of visual plasticity  <cit> . for example, african cichlid fish determine their spectral sensitivity by means of preferential expression by up to seven available cone opsin genes  <cit> .

two rh <dig> polya transcripts were successfully sequenced from neoceratodus forsteri  and sequence analysis shows that the two polya signals are present in a tandem array within the 3' utr. this finding adds to increasing evidence that multiple transcripts arising from tandem polya signals are a common, yet little studied, feature of rh <dig> genes  <cit> . the longer lungfish rh <dig> transcript shows a more intense band than the shorter transcripts , which could be a result of differential stability of the transcripts. there is evidence that some genes contain regulatory elements between polya sites, which influence the stability of the longer mrna transcript  <cit> . rh <dig> transcript levels in mice change according to circadian rhythms, possibly due to inherent transcript stability or even a circadian variation in competing mrna processing factors and therefore site preference  <cit> . the use of alternative polya transcripts as a mechanism of rh <dig> gene regulation therefore evolved early in vertebrate evolution and has been selectively maintained in mammals.

phylogenetic analyses
phylogenetic comparison of codon-matched alignments of both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of rh <dig>  rh <dig>  lws <dig>  sws <dig> and sws <dig> with other vertebrate opsins  using two fundamentally different methods of phylogenetic inference  method and bayesian inference via a metropolis markov chain monte carlo simulation) reveals that lungfish opsins share more similarity with tetrapod opsins than those of other fishes . lungfish opsins form a clade with tetrapod opsins rather than teleost fish in four out of the five opsin families in each analysis, but different topology is obtained between tree branches with low bootstrap values or low posterior probability, in particular within the rh <dig> and lws groups.

phylogenetic analysis of rh opsin nucleotide sequences does not favour the coelacanth as a closer relative to tetrapods than lungfish and further supports an unresolved trichotomy between the coelacanth, lungfish and early tetrapods, which varies according to the gene family investigated and the method of analysis  <cit> . for example, the phylogenetic tree produced using the nj method with nucleotide sequences places lungfish rh <dig> together with tetrapod opsins rather than the coelacanth opsin gene. within the rh <dig> rhodopsin group, however, lungfish and coelacanth sequences are placed together as a sister group to the tetrapod rod pigments. bayesian inference favours the lungfish and coelacanth forming a sister group to the tetrapods from both rh <dig> and rh <dig> sequences . conversely, comparison of amino acid sequences using the nj method  supports coelacanth opsins forming a sister group to both teleost and tetrapod opsins, while lungfish rh <dig> and rh <dig> genes are placed as both a sister group to teleost fish opsins  and tetrapod opsins .

the fish-tetrapod transition occurred in a space of < <dig> million years around  <dig> mya  <cit>  and a large array of genes or whole genome sequences may therefore be needed to resolve the trichotomy between sarcopterygian fish  <cit> . it is unfortunate that the coelacanth genome does not encode a functional sws <dig> pigment as sws <dig> genes have recently been proposed as a good marker for vertebrate phylogenies  <cit> .

the lungfish visual system
our results demonstrate that the full complement of the orthologues of the known vertebrate photoreceptive visual pigment genes are expressed in the retina of the australian lungfish, the nearest, and most primitive, extant relative to the land vertebrates. partial sequences of rh <dig> and lws have also been successfully amplified from the more derived african lungfish protopterus sp. . an earlier molecular study of visual pigments in the retina of a sarcopterygian fish  found only two opsins, rh <dig> and rh <dig> in addition to a pseudogene Ψsws <dig>  <cit> . the coelacanth inhabits a photon-limited deep-sea environment and the move to this low-light, shortwave-shifted environment meant that the subsequent loss of three cone visual pigments  was not a selective disadvantage, revealing a correlation between loss of opsin genes and the spectral habitat/functional needs of a species  <cit> . conversely, the retention of all five vertebrate opsin families in n. forsteri suggests that the dipnoan lineage has lived in a brightly-lit colorful environment throughout its evolutionary history, making it a more appropriate model organism for the early tetrapod visual system than the coelacanth.

CONCLUSIONS
the characterization of four cone opsins reveals the potential for tetrachromatic vision in lungfish, although behavioral work is needed to verify if lungfish can discriminate objects based on differences in chromatic hue. multiple opsins and a range of colored intraocular filters in the retina of n. forsteri  <cit>  suggest that it is adapted for diurnal vision, in contrast to earlier reports that adult lungfish are crepuscular  <cit> . lungfish have a mostly carnivorous diet  <cit>  and may utilise color vision in prey capture or reproductive behaviour. these findings indicate that the first tetrapods probably possessed eyes adapted for chromatic diurnal vision, with all five opsins expressed in the retina. colored oil droplets within the photoreceptors would have also filtered the incident light, enhancing color discrimination by reducing the spectral overlap of pigment absorbance curves  <cit> .
