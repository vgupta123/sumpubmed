BACKGROUND
gene duplication is a major contributor to genetic novelty and proteomic complexity. evolutionary pressures on duplicated genes differ from single copy  genes and several models have been proposed for the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes. in the non/neofunctionalization model, one of the duplicated genes becomes a pseudogene through the accumulation of deleterious mutations although on a rare occasion, it may acquire a new function  <cit> . in the subfunctionalization model  <cit> , duplicated genes adopt a subset of functions of the ancestral gene. functional redundancy of duplicated genes has been shown to increase the robustness of biological systems  <cit> .

gene duplication occurs frequently in plants, either in the form of segmental duplication, tandem duplication, and at the level of whole genome duplication  <cit> . genome duplication has been reported in rice , an important agricultural species and model species for the grass family   <cit> . depending on the methods, parameters, and genome assemblies used, 15% to 62%  <cit>  of the rice genome underwent one round of large-scale segmental duplication that occurred approximately  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . a more recent duplication, on the short arms of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  occurred approximately  <dig> ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . with respect to tandem duplications, depending on the parameters utilized, 14–29% of rice genes occur in tandem  <cit> . paralogous families, composed of tandemly and segmentally duplicated genes, have been studied to a limited extent in rice, typically in a comparative context with the finished genome of the dicotyledonous plant species, arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . to date, only limited genome-wide analyses of paralogous protein families have been reported in rice  <cit> . in horan et al.  <cit> , arabidopsis and rice proteins were co-clustered using pfam domain-based or blastp-based similarity clustering which allowed for the clustering of proteins into families common between these two model species and for the identification of proteins that were species-specific.

in this study, we classified proteins from the predicted rice proteome into paralogous protein families using a computational pipeline that utilizes both pfam and blastp-based novel domains  <cit> . while the focus in our study was analysis of the rice paralogous families, for comparative purposes, we performed a similar classification with the predicted arabidopsis proteome to compare and contrast paralogous family composition and features in two model species which represent two major divisions of the angiosperms, monocots and dicots. in rice, we characterized alternative splicing, functional classification of paralogous family proteins, expression patterns, and duplication age and compared these data to those observed in single copy proteins. a parallel analysis of alternative splicing and functional domain composition of paralogous family proteins was performed with arabidopsis to compare and contrast with the findings in rice. to highlight our observations, we examined in depth two rice protein families, prolamin and bowman-birk inhibitor. this study provides a comprehensive analysis of rice paralogous families in parallel with a comparative analysis in arabidopsis thereby providing novel insight into paralogous gene family evolution in these two model plant species.

RESULTS
classification of paralogous protein families in rice and arabidopsis
a total of  <dig>  paralogous protein families containing  <dig>  proteins were identified  from the  <dig>  total non-transposable element -related proteins predicted in the rice genome, leaving  <dig>  putative singleton proteins encoded by single copy genes. on average, a rice family contained six family members, ranging in size from two to  <dig> family members . a total of  <dig> paralogous protein families with more than one hundred member proteins were identified in rice which encoded proteins such as zinc finger proteins, protein kinases, myb-like proteins, and transducins , similar to the largest protein families reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . paralogous protein family genes of rice were distributed throughout the genome and within chromosomes in a pattern similar to the singleton genes . although paralogous protein family genes were more frequently located in the euchromatic regions, this was consistent with previous reports that non-te-related genes are found more prevalently in euchromatic regions. a comparison of segmentally duplicated genes with the paralogous protein family genes suggested that our classification pipeline was robust. of the  <dig>  segmentally duplicated gene pairs within  <dig> segmentally duplicated blocks,  <dig>  duplicated gene pairs  were classified in the same paralogous protein family. for the remainder of the segmentally duplicated genes,  <dig> pairs  were classified in different paralogous protein families and  <dig>  had one gene classified in a paralogous protein family and the other gene classified as a singleton. we observed that  <dig> segmentally duplicated gene pairs  were not included in any paralogous protein family. note that in our computational pipeline, four or more members were required to define a blastp-based domain. consequently, a single pair of segmentally duplicated genes alone is insufficient to define a blastp-based domain. the lack of 100% correspondence between segmental duplication and paralogous family classification may be due to the acquisition of new domain or loss of existing domain within one of the duplicated genes as in our computational pipeline, only proteins with the identical domain composition were classified into the same paralogous protein family. alternatively, the difference could be due to the different classification methods employed in each method. for example, loc_os08g <dig> and loc_os09g <dig> are segmentally duplicated genes from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these two protein sequences had a 56% identity over 70% of the length of the longer sequence and were within a segmentally duplicated block of  <dig> collinear gene pairs. loc_os08g <dig> has two pfam domains  while loc_os09g <dig> has only one pfam domain . as a consequence, these loci were classified in two different paralogous families . in a second example, loc_os11g <dig> and loc_os12g <dig> are from a segmental duplication event involving chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> which includes  <dig> collinear gene pairs. loc_os11g <dig> has a single pfam domain  and thus is classified in family  <dig> while loc_os12g <dig> is classified as a singleton as although it has two pfam domains  no other protein has exactly the same domain profile. note that in our computational pipeline, a paralogous family must have at least two members with identical domain profiles. in a third example, segmentally duplicated genes loc_os01g <dig> and loc_os05g <dig> are from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  these two genes were derived from full length cdnas  and had a 59% identity over approximately three-quarters of the longer protein sequence. loc_os01g <dig> has two pfam domains  while loc_os05g <dig> has only one single pfam domain . as a consequence, they were classified in different families, family  <dig> and family  <dig>  respectively. manual inspection of these three sets of loci revealed that they were correctly annotated and that the lack of clustering into a single paralogous family could not be attributed to incorrect structural annotation which is another potential cause for lack of 100% correspondence between segmentally duplicated genes and paralogous families.

a parallel construction of paralogous protein families in arabidopsis identified  <dig>  paralogous protein families  and  <dig>  single copy genes from a total of  <dig>  protein coding genes from tair <dig> release  <cit> . a similar size distribution of arabidopsis protein families was observed, ranging from two to  <dig> . in arabidopsis, the largest families encode myb-like proteins, zinc finger proteins, and protein kinases, consistent with what has been reported previously  <cit> . arabidopsis paralogous protein family genes distributed similarly to singleton genes and were more frequently located in the euchromatic regions .

function of paralogous protein families in rice and arabidopsis
we examined the functional annotation of paralogous family and singleton proteins. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were annotated as encoding known or putative proteins in rice and arabidopsis, respectively, due to strong similarity with proteins with a known function or the presence of pfam domains above the trusted cutoff. genes with no known or putative function can be supported by experimental transcript evidence  or are predicted solely by an ab initio gene finder and lack expression support as well as sequence similarity to known proteins with the exception of other hypothetical proteins . in rice, a total of  <dig>  genes encode expressed proteins as shown by experimental transcript evidence from expressed sequence tags , flcdnas, massively parallel signature sequencing  <cit> , serial analysis of gene expression, and/or proteomic data  <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig>  genes encode expressed proteins as shown by experimental transcript in the form of ests and/or cdna evidence . the remaining  <dig>  rice genes  <cit>  and  <dig>  arabidopsis genes  encode hypothetical proteins. a majority of rice paralogous family genes  encode either a known or putative protein . the remaining rice paralogous family genes encode expressed proteins  and hypothetical proteins . in contrast, rice singletons had a larger portion of hypothetical genes  and a smaller portion of genes with a known or putative function . even though arabidopsis overall has a smaller number of genes with unknown function than rice, a similar bias of genes with a known or putative function in paralogous family genes was observed in a parallel analysis in arabidopsis .

using plant goslim annotations  <cit> , we compared the function of the proteins within rice paralogous families to that in the singletons. within the  <dig> molecular function goslim categories identified in our analyses, rice paralogous protein families showed different patterns from singletons in a number of goslim categories . although, the relative abundance of each goslim category varied with the size of the rice paralogous family, no obvious correlation was observed . for each category, a two-tailed two-sample binomial test was performed by comparing the abundance of that category in rice paralogous families with that in the singletons. multiple testing was corrected using the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate control at a level of  <dig>   <cit> . the statistical test revealed a substantial enrichment of  <dig> categories in rice paralogous family proteins including transcription factor activity, hydrolase activity, dna binding, and transporter activity while a substantial reduction was seen in five categories including receptor activity, nucleotide binding and carbohydrate binding . a similar skew in goslim categories was observed in a parallel analysis in arabidopsis , consistent with a previous report in arabidopsis  <cit>  that non-random loss and retention of paralogous genes with different functions occurred after gene duplication.

paralogous protein family genes tend to have more alternative isoforms than singletons
alternative splicing has been regarded as a mechanism to increase genetic novelty. in the rice genome,  <dig>  non-te-related genes have evidence of alternative splicing  and we used this set of genes to examine alternative splicing in singleton versus paralogous protein family genes. the percentage of alternative splicing in single copy genes is  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %, while that in paralogous family genes is  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %; a statistically significant difference . to remove any bias due to genes that lack transcript evidence, we restricted our analysis to genes with est and/or flcdna evidence. the percentage of alternative splicing in singletons is  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %, while that in paralogous protein family genes is  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %; a statistically significant difference . we further restricted our analysis to high confidence genes whose structures were completely supported by ests and/or flcdnas. the percentage of alternative splicing in singletons increases to  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %, while that in paralogous protein family genes increases to  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %; a statistically significant difference .

to confirm that our observation was not restricted to rice, we performed a parallel analysis with arabidopsis. using data on alternative splicing as provided with the tair <dig> release , the percentage of alternative splicing in arabidopsis single copy genes is 943/ <dig>  =  <dig> %, while that in paralogous protein family genes is  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %. this difference is also statistically significant , similar to that observed in rice. restricting the analysis to only those arabidopsis genes with est and/or cdna support as provided in the tair <dig> release revealed that the percentage of alternative splicing in singletons is 942/ <dig>  =  <dig> %, while that in paralogous family genes is  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> %; a statistically significant difference . our findings are contradictory to previous reports in model animal species in which duplicated genes tend to have fewer alternative spliced isoforms thereby supporting the 'function-sharing model' that alternative splicing and gene duplication are two mechanisms that are complementary with respect to proteomic function diversity  <cit> . our results suggested that plants may employ multiple mechanisms for proteomic complexity, gene duplication and alternative splicing.

age of paralogous protein families in rice
while there are previous reports on gene duplication in rice  <cit> , they utilized alternative assemblies and annotation datasets of the rice genome. to provide information on the age of paralogous families identified in this study, we estimated the age of a paralogous family from the maximum value of the distribution of pairwise ds calculated among all members of that protein family . we found that the origin of most paralogous families dates back to over  <dig> million years , the point at which synonymous sites are saturated and dating becomes unreliable  . among protein families for which the maximum pairwise ds value is less than  <dig> , the distribution of maximum ds is fairly flat, with the exception of a recent peak at ds between  <dig> and  <dig>  . this suggests that paralogous families have been arising at a relatively constant pace within the past  <dig> my, but that a burst of duplication took place within the last  <dig>  my. alternatively, paralogous families arise at a rate similar to that observed for the first few million years, but about 2/ <dig> of them revert to single-gene status soon thereafter, accounting for the quick decline after the first  <dig>  my. the fairly constant number of older paralogous families can be due to selective constraints maintaining the elevated copy number or if the loss of paralogs is dependent on sequence similarity, such that after ~10% sequence divergence, paralog loss is negligible. finally, for each family we identified the largest peak below  <dig>   in the distribution of all pairwise ds values. the distribution of this peak value across all families is bimodal , and it confirms the presence of a large number of recently duplicated genes . in addition, the peak at  <dig>  ≤ ds ≤  <dig> most likely results from the large-scale segmental duplication event that occurred ~ <dig> mya.

expression of paralogous protein families in rice
we further examined the expression patterns of the paralogous families using mpss data from  <dig> libraries  <cit> . mpss tags were searched against our release  <dig> pseudomolecules and cdna sequences of all annotated gene models to ensure that all mpss tags would be identified even if they spanned the intron. we found  <dig>  genes within the paralogous protein families that were associated with unique, reliable, and significant mpss tags, which were referred as mpss-qualifying genes.

suitable summary statistics of correlation for expression divergence of a gene family can be found in gu  <cit>  and gu et al.  <cit> , though microarray data were the primary focus in these studies. to be concise, we restricted our analysis of expression correlation in the libraries and tissues to paralogous families with exactly two mpss-qualifying genes . to measure the expression correlation, the pearson's correlation coefficient  of their expression was computed for each pair of mpss-qualifying genes from each of the  <dig> protein families across all  <dig> mpss libraries. it is important to note that we excluded mpss tags which mapped to multiple locations, as most of these are likely to match to closely-related paralogs and could have confounded our analyses. we employed the method used by blanc and wolfe  <cit>  to determine a minimum cutoff value for pearson's correlation coefficient  to classify two duplicated genes as having divergent expression. basically, a total of  <dig>  gene pairs were generated by random shuffling of the singleton genes and the pearson's correlation coefficient  was calculated similarly for each pair. ninety five percent of the random shuffled gene pairs had a correlation value r <  <dig> . as random shuffled gene pairs should have divergent function and expression patterns, we utilized r <  <dig>  as an indicator of divergent expression. our results show that the expression correlation value  of the paralogous protein family genes ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig>  although the majority of the gene pairs had little correlation with r peaking at - <dig>  ~ <dig>  similar to that observed with the singletons . using the correlation cutoff , a total of  <dig>  paralogous protein families with two-qualifying mpss genes exhibited divergent expression patterns, consistent with what has been reported in arabidopsis  <cit>  and in yeast in which more than 80% of the older duplicated gene pairs  showed divergence in expression  <cit> .

to gain a better understanding of the expression patterns of paralogous protein family members in different organs/tissues, we classified the  <dig> mpss libraries  <cit>  into four groups by organs/tissues: roots, leaves, reproductive organs/tissues, and "other tissues". within the  <dig> paralogous families with exactly two mpss-qualifying genes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> paralogous families had only a single member of the pair expressed in roots, leaves, reproductive organs/tissues, and "other tissues", respectively, which demonstrated their diverged expression patterns, and possible tissue-specific expression. to further examine the tissue-specific or stress-induced expression patterns of paralogous protein family members, we calculated the preferential expression measure  for each of the  <dig>  genes from the  <dig> paralogous families  in the  <dig> mpss libraries. the pem shows the base- <dig> log of ratio of the observed expression level in a given tissue/treatment to the expected expression level assuming uniform expression across all tissues/treatments. a pem value of  <dig> means the observed expression level in a given tissue/treatment is  <dig> times that of expected and indicates strong tissue specific expression. for each gene, tissue with a stringent cutoff of pem ≥  <dig> were compared with the other member of the duplicated gene pair. a total of  <dig>  of the paralogous families showed little tissue-specific expression as none of the associated pems had a value equal to or greater than  <dig>  two hundred ninety-nine families showed strong tissue specific expression patterns;  <dig> families were preferentially expressed in the same tissue or treatment,  <dig> families were preferentially expressed in different tissues or treatments, and  <dig> families had only one of the duplicated genes with preferential tissue-specific expression.

we further examined the correlation between expression divergence and sequence divergence. for each family, we calculated the pearson's correlation coefficient  for all possible pairs of the mpss-qualifying genes to measure expression divergence. we then used ds as a proxy of divergence time for each gene pair. we restricted our analysis to ds ≤  <dig>  so that the synonymous sites are not saturated. the pearson's correlation coefficient  values were plotted against the ds values for each interval of  <dig>  to gain better resolution. that is, we plotted for gene pairs with  <dig> <ds ≤  <dig> ,  <dig>  <ds ≤  <dig> ,  <dig>  <ds ≤  <dig> , and so on. we found no correlation between ds and correlation of expression except for gene pairs with  <dig> <ds ≤  <dig>   where duplicated genes were relatively young . the number of non-synonymous substitutions per site  was also calculated for each gene pair and plotted against correlation of expression. no correlation was observed between dn and correlation of expression . this is consistent with reports in arabidopsis in which expression divergence is not strictly coupled with sequence divergence as shown by no appreciable change for the majority of gene duplicates with highly diverged amino acid sequences in expression pattern in developing roots  <cit> .

positive correlation of expression patterns among paralogous protein family members would suggest that similar transcriptional regulation was retained in both members and possibly, similar functions. however, we observed a large number of gene pairs with little expression correlation which could be an indication of subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization after gene duplication. the duplication-degeneration-complementarity  model proposed by force et al.  <cit>  and lynch and force  <cit>  suggests that subfunctionalization is a major mechanism for retention of duplicated genes as a result of differential expression caused by accumulation of mutations in regulatory regions rather than protein coding regions. the  <dig> families with preferential expression in two different tissues or treatments, along with the  <dig> families having only one member of the paralogous pair preferentially expressed, is a strong indicator of subfunctionalization. as our paralogous protein family classification required that each family member have the same domain profile, the differential expression may be attributable to mutations in regulatory regions rather than gene coding regions, consistent with the ddc model.

case studies of rice paralogous protein families
prolamin protein family
prolamin is one of the major endosperm storage proteins in cereal grains such as wheat, barley, rye, maize, and sorghum  <cit> . it was named prolamin due to its high content of proline and glutamine. in rice, prolamin contributes 35% of the total seed protein  <cit> . three classes of prolamins have been identified in oryza by their molecular weights:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda  <cit> . the major prolamin families in rice are family  <dig>  and family  <dig> . members of both families have a blastp-based domain. members of family  <dig> have a pfam domain  in addition to the common blastp-based domain and thus were not clustered within family  <dig> as the exact same domain profile is required for each family member in our computational pipeline . all of the prolamin genes were single-exon genes as reported previously  <cit>  with the exception of four genes that contained a single intron which were further examined and found that based on the est alignments they were single-exon genes that had not been properly annotated . the length of the deduced amino acids of the prolamin proteins  varied from  <dig> to  <dig> bp with two peaks at 101~ <dig> and 145~ <dig> bp, consistent with what had been reported in rice prolamin proteins  <cit> .

only five prolamin family members  were associated with unique, reliable, and significant mpss tags, which, as expected, were exclusively expressed in 3-day germinating seeds with relatively high abundances , respectively) . we also examined the expression of the two prolamin families with that of family  <dig>  which contained the same pfam domain  that was in prolamin family  <dig> . a total of  <dig> genes from family  <dig> were associated with unique, reliable, and significant mpss tags. however, the expression pattern observed in family  <dig> substantially differed from that of the prolamin families  in that most of the genes were expressed in multiple organs/tissues .

interestingly, we observed that genes encoding the prolamin protein family seemed to localize closely on the chromosomes. a total of  <dig> prolamin protein family genes were located together on chromosome  <dig> with a large number of te-related genes inserted between the family members . other prolamin protein family genes were located on chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , and chromosome  <dig> , suggestive of tandem duplication of the prolamin protein family genes followed by insertion of transposable elements throughout the course of evolution. this is consistent with previous report on the compact expansion of α-zein gene family of maize  <cit> .

bowman-birk inhibitor  type protein family
bbi is a cysteine-rich protein which has trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities  <cit> . it was first characterized in soybean  <cit>  and later found widely distributed in monocot and dicot species  <cit> . it has been extensively studied due to its possible role in plant defense  <cit>  and its potential application in cancer chemoprevention  <cit> . the major bbi type protein families in rice are family  <dig>  and family  <dig> . while both families have the pfam domain pf <dig> , family  <dig> also has a second domain identified via blastp . amino acid composition analysis showed that 31% and 47% of the conserved residues of family  <dig> and family  <dig>  respectively, was cysteine suggesting that this amino acid has an important role in the protease inhibitory activity of bbi. these composition data also revealed subtle differences between the two bbi type protein families. the phylogenetic tree generated by mega version  <dig>   <cit>  for family  <dig>  suggests that after the original duplication event, only one of the paralogs underwent further rounds of duplication, consistent with the physical clustering of this set of bbi genes on chromosome  <dig> .

mpss analysis showed that the bbi genes were differentially expressed in a wide range of tissues and organs, consistent with previously reported expression patterns  <cit> . seven genes of family  <dig> were associated with unique, reliable, and significant mpss tags with the pairwise pearson's correlation coefficient values ranging from - <dig>  to  <dig> . two genes within family  <dig> were associated with unique, reliable, and significant mpss tags, which showed little correlation in expression . it would be interesting to determine expression levels of the bbi genes following wounding, as seven proteins of the family  <dig> were annotated as bowman-birk type bran trypsin inhibitor precursors, a type which was reported to play an important role in plant defense  <cit> , and two members of the family  <dig> were annotated as wound-induced bbi type wip <dig> precursors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that even relatively small plant genomes such as rice and arabidopsis have a significant portion of their proteomes in paralogous families, resulting in a partially redundant proteome. the origin of most paralogous gene families in the rice genome seems to be very old, but duplicates have continued to arise at a fairly steady pace, with a peak in duplication being coincident with a major segmental duplication that took place at ~ <dig> mya. while conservation of protein domains was clearly observed within rice and arabidopsis paralogous families, we did observe a major skew in types of proteins and protein domains within paralogous families versus singleton proteins, suggesting an impact of selection occurred during genome evolution and gene duplication. another level of potential functionality in paralogous family proteins could also occur through alternative splicing which was statistically more frequent in paralogous family proteins compared to singletons in both rice as well as arabidopsis. in rice, while some paralogous family members were transcriptionally co-regulated, divergence in expression patterns was clearly evident, thereby allowing an expanded range of functionality for the protein. these data suggested that multiple mechanisms are present in plant genomes to generate protein diversity and that these two model plant species share at least a subset of these mechanisms.
