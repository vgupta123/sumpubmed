BACKGROUND
a small gram-negative bacterium that resembled members of the genus pasteurella in many features was isolated in  <dig> from a moribund muskrat found on the shoreline of a marsh on the bear river migratory bird refuge in northern utah
 <cit> . based on morphological and biochemical characteristics, this bacterium was originally classified as yersinia philomiragia . additional isolations  of bacteria similar to the muskrat pathogen were made in  <dig> from surface water samples collected in marshy areas within few miles of the bear river research station, utah
 <cit> . subsequent studies indicated that atcc strains 25015t,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were biochemically and genetically different from members of the genus yersinia <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig>  fourteen isolates resembling yersinia philomiragia were reported from clinical cases
 <cit> . these human isolates and the  <dig> atcc strains from utah were reclassified based on biochemical characteristics, cellular fatty acid compositions, and dna hybridization studies as francisella philomiragia  in 1989
 <cit> .

most of the clinical isolates of f. philomiragia are from human cases associated with saltwater exposure and the first environmental isolates were from a marshy area that forms part of the great salt lake waterway
 <cit> . not surprisingly, f. philomiragia is halotolerant and grows in media containing 6% nacl, whereas francisella tularensis does not
 <cit> . furthermore, in the laboratory, f. philomiragia is less fastidious than f. tularensis and does not require cysteine for growth
 <cit> . f. philomiragia is considered an opportunistic pathogen and is most commonly isolated from patients with chronic granulomatous disease or those who experienced near-drowning in saltwater
 <cit> . in contrast, f. tularensis is a highly infectious zoonotic agent and tularemia in healthy individuals exposed to contaminated freshwater sources has been reported
 <cit> . nevertheless, f. tularensis is generally not associated with saltwater exposure and is not known to cause near-drowning-associated pneumonia
 <cit> . isolations of f. philomiragia in the clinical laboratory have been sporadic and only four human cases have been reported in the last two decades
 <cit> . a case of septicemia due to f. philomiragia has also been reported in a north carolina dog that lived in a coastal town
 <cit> .

recent attempts at direct isolation of francisella spp. from environmental samples using cysteine heart agar with 9% chocolatized sheep blood have yielded three strains  from seawater collected in the galveston bay area, texas
 <cit> . comparisons of 16s rrna and sdha genes from these strains with those of other francisella spp.  have indicated that strain tx07- <dig> is more similar to f. philomiragia than to f. tularensis <cit> . a phylogenetic study based on 16s rrna genes of several members of francisellaceae has clustered strain tx07- <dig> with an uncultured bacterium clone ssw64au obtained from the salton sea in california
 <cit> . in addition, f. philomiragia has been detected in samples obtained from a brackish-water pond in martha’s vineyard, massachusetts
 <cit> . furthermore, a close taxonomic relationship between f. philomiragia and francisella noatunensis, an emerging fish pathogen associated with marine environments, has also been established
 <cit> .

francisella novicida is thought to constitute an environmental lineage along with f. philomiragia, and the genome of f. novicida strain u <dig> has been sequenced and compared to the genome sequences of f. tularensis strains pathogenic to humans
 <cit> . the genomes of f. novicida-like strains fx <dig> and  <dig>  which are clinical isolates from the usa and australia, respectively, have also been sequenced and compared to the genome sequence of strain u112
 <cit> . in view of the ecological significance of f. philomiragia, the complete genome of strain atcc  <dig>  and a draft genome of strain atcc 25015t  have been sequenced. comparative genomic analyses of these strains with f. novicida and f. tularensis isolates have revealed major differences in metabolic competency and putative pathogenic characteristics
 <cit> . in addition, a preliminary genomic sequence of f. noatunensis isolate gm <dig> and its comparison to f. philomiragia have been reported
 <cit> . the objectives of the present study were to sequence the genome of francisella strain tx07- <dig> and to identify the genetic differences between this strain and f. philomiragia strain atcc  <dig> using a comparative genomics approach. since genetic relationships and evolutionary contexts could be better understood by whole-genome analyses of conserved operons, it was envisaged to include the genomes of different francisella species and strains in the comparisons, when feasible.

methods
bacterial cultivation and chromosomal dna extraction were performed at the centers for disease control and prevention, fort collins, using standard procedures
 <cit> . genomic library construction, sequencing, and finishing were performed at the genome science facilities of los alamos national laboratory as described previously
 <cit> . prediction of the number of subsystems and pairwise blast comparisons of protein sets within strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> were performed using the rapid annotation using subsystems technology , which is a fully automated, prokaryotic genome annotation service
 <cit> . proteins deemed to be specific to each strain were compared against the ncbi non-redundant protein database to determine whether they were hypothetical or conserved hypothetical. if there was no adequate alignment with any protein , the translated open reading frame  was named a hypothetical protein.

multiple genome comparisons were performed using the ‘progressive alignment’ option available in the program mauve version  <dig> . <dig>  default scoring and parameters were used for generating the alignment. a synteny plot was generated using the program nucmer. the program uses exact matching, clustering, and alignment extension strategies to create a dot plot based on the number of identical alignments between two genomes. prophage regions  were identified using prophinder , an algorithm that combines similarity searches, statistical detection of phage-gene enriched regions, and genomic context for prophage prediction. insertion sequences  were identified by whole genome blast analysis of strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> using the is finder . gene acquisition and loss among the different strains were determined by comparing gene order, orientation of genes , gc content of genes , features of intergenic regions , and the similarity of proteins encoded by genes at a locus of interest .

the integrated microbial genomes system  was used for comparing the genomes and identification of shared and unique protein encoding genes. the phylogenetic profiling tool within img was used to find single gene homologs. three 3-way comparisons were performed using different genome orders, and the lowest number was used to represent the core genes in the venn diagram. pairwise comparisons were performed bidirectionally for each pair of genomes and the lowest number was used in the diagram. strain-specific genes were obtained by subtracting the larger number of common genes from the total number of genes in the genome. the specific parameters used for the analysis were: e-value: 1e-05; minimum percent identity: 30%; algorithm: by present/absent homologs; minimum taxon percent with homologs: 100%.

multiple sequence alignments for phylogenetic analyses of strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> were performed using the program muscle available at the website http://www.phylogeny.fr/
 <cit> . the alignment was followed by a bootstrapped  neighbor joining method for inferring the phylogenies
 <cit> . only full-length 16s rrna and succinate dehydrogenase  gene sequences from high quality, finished francisella genomes were included in these comparisons.

RESULTS
general genome comparisons
the chromosome of strain atcc  <dig> was  <dig>  bp larger than that of strain tx07- <dig>  although the chromosomes of strains atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  and tx07- <dig> had minor differences in size, their average gc content and the percentage of sequence that encodes proteins were similar . whole genome alignment using mauve showed the presence of extensive blocks of homologous regions among the chromosomes of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> . nucmer analyses revealed that the chromosome of strain atcc  <dig> had many gaps, translocations, and/or inversions when compared to that of strain tx07- <dig> . detailed sequence examination indicated that some of these gaps and/or inversions were associated with integrative elements. strain tx07- <dig> contained a genomic island  that was absent in strain atcc  <dig>  but was present in f. novicida strain u <dig> . strain tx07- <dig> contained yet another genomic island  that was also absent in strain atcc  <dig>  but was partially present in f. novicida strain u <dig> . strain atcc  <dig> contained a genomic island  that was absent in strain tx07- <dig> and f. novicida strain u <dig>  furthermore, strain tx07- <dig> lacked plasmids, but strain atcc  <dig> contained a single plasmid
 <cit> . 

 <dig> type strain, draft genome.

 <dig> subsystems predicted by rast server.

 <dig> each strain contains three rrna operons  and an orphan 5s rrna fragment.

a three-way comparison of the chromosomes of strains u <dig>  atcc  <dig>  and tx07- <dig> revealed that they encoded  <dig>  orthologous protein-coding genes . strain atcc  <dig> chromosome encoded  <dig> protein-coding genes with no homologs in strains tx07- <dig> and u <dig>  strain tx07- <dig> chromosome encoded  <dig> protein-coding genes with no homologs in strains u <dig> and atcc  <dig>  strain u <dig> encoded  <dig> protein-coding genes with no homologs in strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> . in strain atcc  <dig>   <dig> predicted genes could not be assigned a function based on blast analysis and have therefore been annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. in strain tx07- <dig>   <dig> predicted genes have been annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins.

ribosomal rna operons and trna genes
bacterial rrna operons generally contain the 16s, 23s, and 5s rrna genes linked together by one or more trna genes located in the internal transcribed spacer
 <cit> . chromosomes of most members of the genus francisella sequenced to date, including strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig>  contained three copies of the 16s rrna-trnaile-trnaala-23s rrna-5s rrna operon. although the three rrna operon sequences were remarkably homogenous within any genome, some degree of heterogeneity was obvious between the f. philomiragia and f. tularensis/novicida genomes . notably, the chromosomes of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained an unlinked  <dig> bp 5s rrna sequence  that was also present in other members of the genus francisella . furthermore, the positions of the three rrna operons were not conserved in the chromosomes of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig>  but they were relatively conserved among the chromosomes of f. novicida and f. tularensis strains.

a positive correlation between the abundance of trna and rrna genes among bacterial genomes has been observed
 <cit> . typically, bacteria with three 16s rrna genes are expected to contain ~ <dig> trna genes
 <cit> . not surprisingly, members of the genus francisella contain 37– <dig> trna genes , representing all  <dig> amino acids. although some redundancy of trna genes was apparent among all francisella genomes , they each contained a single copy of trnaasn, trnaasp, trnacys, trnagln, trnaglu, trnahis, trnaphe, trnapro, trnatrp, and trnatyr genes. in all of the publicly available francisella genomes, genes encoding trnaile and trnaala were never present outside of the rrna operons. this is generally true of most other bacteria and the occurrence of genes encoding trnaile and trnaala genes within the rrna operons has also been noted in escherichia coli k <dig> and rhodopseudomonas palustris <cit> . furthermore, almost all francisella genomes contained genes encoding putative aminoacyl trna synthetases specific for each of the  <dig> amino acids. they also contained a single gene encoding a putative peptidyl-trna hydrolase .

integrative and transposable elements
short sequence repeats, which include insertion sequences , are the hallmark of f. tularensis genomes and these is elements are thought to be generally stable among different isolates despite their diverse geographical origins
 <cit> . pair-wise blastn analyses indicated that is elements were less abundant in the genome of strain tx07- <dig> in comparison to those of f. tularensis strains schu s <dig> and osu <dig>  which contained at least six categories of is elements . whole genome blastp analyses showed that strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> each contained a single copy of the isftu <dig> sequence , but they lacked isftu <dig> and isftu3-isftu <dig> sequences . furthermore, strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> contained at least  <dig> truncated loci related to is <dig> .

in strain tx07- <dig>  the locus adjacent to f7308_ <dig> encoded an integral membrane protein , a phosphoserine phosphatase , a lignostilbene-alpha, beta-dioxygenase , and a beta carotene dioxygenase . interestingly, the homologs of these orfs in strain atcc  <dig>  were associated with fphi_ <dig>  which encoded a putative integrase . strain atcc  <dig> contained  <dig> full-length and  <dig> truncated orthologs of fphi_ <dig> . whereas an ortholog of fphi_ <dig> was present in francisella piscicida strain gm <dig> , it was absent in all other publicly available francisella genomes, including strain atcc  <dig> 

strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> also contained a putative mutator family transposase  that was absent in all other publicly available francisella genomes, except strain atcc  <dig>  in strain atcc  <dig>  this transposable element was associated with a gene encoding a putative chitinase  whose ortholog was present in strain atcc  <dig>  but not in strain tx07- <dig> and all other publicly available francisella genomes. strain tx07- <dig> mutator family transposase was associated with genes encoding a putative chitinase  and a two-component response regulator  whose orthologs were present in strain atcc  <dig>  but not in strain atcc  <dig> and all other publicly available francisella genomes. furthermore, strain atcc  <dig> contained a locus  encoding a putative tn <dig> family transposase , an integrase , a tn <dig> family transposase , a transposase-like protein , and an invertase/recombinase/resolvase-like protein . these genes were absent in all other publicly available complete francisella genomes, including strain tx07- <dig>  several genes encoding putative phage integrases were also identified in the genomes of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> .

type iv pili, oligopeptide abc transporter system, francisella pathogenicity island, and iron metabolism genes
several species of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria contain type iv pili, also known as fimbriae, which facilitate bacterial adhesion to host cells, biofilm formation, and twitching motility
 <cit> . structures resembling type iv pili have been observed on the surface of f. tularensis live vaccine strain  and f. novicida strain u <dig> using transmission electron microscopy
 <cit> . recent evidence suggests that type iv pili are required for virulence of f. tularensis and comparisons of available francisella genomes have revealed the heterogeneity of genes putatively involved in the assembly of type iv pili
 <cit> . strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained several orfs that encoded putative proteins related to the assembly of type iv pili . although most of these genes were found in different locations on the two chromosomes, two gene clusters were conspicuous from gross comparisons . since many of the genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of type iv pili in strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> were also present in f. novicida and f. tularensis strains , the biochemical and functional similarity of type iv pili among these bacteria cannot be ruled out. nevertheless, the role of type iv pili in the survival of f. philomiragia in the environment needs to be carefully studied, especially in light of recent reports of the ability of this bacterium to form biofilms and interact with the aquatic protist acanthamoeba castellanii <cit> . 

1homologs of these genes are also found in strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> 

2homologs of these genes are also found in strain atcc  <dig>  but absent in strain tx07- <dig> 

3homologs of these genes are also found in strain atcc  <dig>  but absent in strain atcc  <dig> 

4homologs of these genes are also found in strain atcc  <dig>  but absent in strain tx07- <dig> 

several bacterial species possess oligopeptide permeases , which are atp-binding cassette transporters of oligopeptides
 <cit> . the imported oligopeptides serve as a source of nitrogen for the cell and may also have a role in signal transduction and pathogenesis
 <cit> . a typical bacterial oligopeptide transport system consists of five proteins encoded by the oppabcdf operon
 <cit> . it has been reported that oppd and oppf occur as separate orfs in type a strains of f. tularensis, but a  <dig> bp internal deletion has caused the disruption of oppd and oppf coding sequences in type b strains of f. tularensis <cit> . genome comparisons indicated that f. philomiragia strain atcc  <dig> and f. novicida strain u <dig> contained an opp locus . within this locus, ftn_ <dig> encoded a putative full-length oppd protein , but fphi_ <dig> was annotated as a pseudogene because of a frame-shift mutation . although the opp locus was present in a complete or truncated form in most currently available francisella genomes, it was absent in strain tx07- <dig>  it is possible that strain tx07- <dig> lost the ancestral opp locus during reductive evolution or it represents a lineage that evolved before the acquisition of the opp locus by the f. philomiragia clade.

a cluster of 17– <dig> genes has been proposed to constitute the francisella pathogenicity island  and is found in a single copy in f. novicida strain u <dig> , but is duplicated in the genomes of f. tularensis <cit> . genome comparisons revealed that strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> also contained a cluster of genes related to the fpi . the predicted proteins within the putative fpis of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> had an average identity of  <dig> % . the order and orientation of genes within the fpi of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> were similar. furthermore, the homolog of ftn_ <dig>  which encodes a hypothetical protein in f. novicida strain u <dig>  was truncated in strain tx07- <dig>  and homologs of ftn_1318-ftn_ <dig>  were absent in strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> 

the biosynthesis of a polycarboxylate siderophore in f. tularensis strain schu s <dig> and f. novicida strain u <dig> has been described previously
 <cit> . strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained the ferric uptake regulator gene  and a cluster of genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of a polycarboxylate siderophore . an ortholog of strain schu s <dig> fupa , whose product is required for efficient utilization of siderophore-bound iron
 <cit> , was also found in strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> . the presence of fpi-related genes, fur, and fupa in almost all francisella genomes suggests that these functions are essential for their survival in the environment and/or host.

genetics of uronic acid metabolism
some bacteria have evolved mechanisms for the metabolism of uronic acids and uronates using the entner-doudoroff pathway
 <cit> . in this pathway, α-d-glucuronic acid  is converted into 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate  by a three-step process. the subsequent phosphorylation of kdg yields 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate , which is finally cleaved to produce glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  and pyruvate. comparative genomic analyses indicated that strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> contained a cluster of nine orfs that appeared to constitute a polycistronic operon . these orfs encoded putative proteins related to enzymes involved in glcua catabolism . similar operons were also identified in f. novicida-like strains fx <dig> and 3523
 <cit> .

the predicted mannonate dehydratase, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconokinase, kdpg aldolase, and glucuronate isomerase proteins from strain tx07- <dig> had 57%, 37%, 36%, and 28% identities to e. coli uxua , kdgk , kdga , and uxac , respectively . these enzymes catalyze the dehydration of d-mannonate to kdg, phosphorylation of kdg, cleavage of kdpg to pyruvate and g3p, and the conversion of d-glucuronate to d-fructuronate, respectively
 <cit> . the glcua utilization gene cluster of strain tx07- <dig> had some similarities to that of bacillus stearothermophilus t- <dig>  which has been predicted to metabolize glcua akin to e. coli and bacillus sutbtilis <cit> .

the orfs encoding a putative inositol oxygenase in strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> had no bacterial homologs in the public databases outside of the genus francisella. however, strain tx07- <dig> inositol oxygenase had 37% identity to mus musculus myo-inositol oxygenase , which catalyzes the conversion of myo-inositol to glcua
 <cit> . myo-inositol and its derivatives are ubiquitous among eukaryotes and archaea, but their synthesis and metabolism is believed to be less common among bacteria
 <cit> . although none of the f. tularensis genomes sequenced to date had orfs encoding proteins putatively involved in the transport and/or metabolism of myo-inositol, most of them had a suhb homolog . a suhb homolog was also found in the genomes of strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> . this evolutionarily conserved gene encoded inositol-1-monophosphatase, which hydrolyzes myo-inositol-1-phosphate to yield free myo-inositol
 <cit> . thus, it appears that most members of francisella can convert myo-inositol-1-phosphate to free myo-inositol. however, only some strains may be able to utilize myo-inositol to synthesize glcua, which is then metabolized using the entner-doudoroff pathway.

atypical lac operons
the lac operon, which contains the structural genes encoding proteins that facilitate lactose metabolism, is found in a variety of bacteria. lactose is imported into the cell as a free sugar by means of a permease and the enzyme β-galactosidase hydrolyzes this disaccharide into galactose and glucose
 <cit> . genome comparisons revealed that strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  but not strain tx07- <dig>  contained a cluster of two orfs that appeared to constitute an operon . similar lac operons were also identified in f. novicida-like strains fx <dig> and 3523
 <cit> . strain atcc  <dig> predicted lacz had 29% identity to the β-galactosidase  of carnobacterium maltaromaticum <cit>  and 26% identity to the β-galactosidase  of bacillus subtilis <cit> , but was unrelated to the β-galactosidase of e. coli. strain atcc  <dig> lacy had 25% identity to the putative oligogalacturonide transporter  of e. coli cft <dig> and 22% identity to the putative sugar transporter  of bacillus cereus. however, genes encoding the galactoside o-acetyltransferase  and the regulatory protein  were not found in strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  in strain atcc  <dig>  an orf  encoding a putative transposase/integrase-like protein was found near the lac operon. furthermore, several f. tularensis genomes  contained a truncated/vestigial lacz, but lacked a lacy .

although the classic lac operon of e. coli consists of three orfs , which are regulated by the product of the adjacent laci repressor gene, bacteria containing only laczy or lacz have been identified
 <cit> . while the evolutionary origin of the e. coli lac operon is uncertain
 <cit> , the occurrence of lac genes near integrative and conjugative elements and the identification of e. coli-like lac operons in some gram-positive bacteria suggest their lateral mobility
 <cit> . from genome comparisons, it appeared that the last common lactose-utilizing ancestor of f. philomiragia strain atcc  <dig> and f. tularensis strains may have acquired the laczy operon by transposon-mediated horizontal transfer. nevertheless, detailed phylogenetic analyses are required to establish the evolutionary origin of the francisella lac operon. the loss of the laczy operon in most f. tularensis strains may be due to niche selection or through genetic drift, and a similar mechanism for some members of enterobacteriaceae has been proposed
 <cit> . the ability to metabolize lactose probably affords strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> a growth advantage in environments where the sugar is present and these may represent a subset of francisella that have retained an ancestral copy of the lac operon. the lacz gene identified in this report could be useful in studies involving pathogenic f. tularensis strains that require a native reporter protein.

genetics of thiamine, riboflavin, folate, biotin, and siroheme biosynthesis
thiamine pyrophosphate  is involved in several microbial metabolic functions
 <cit> . prokaryotes have evolved elaborate mechanisms to either synthesize this important co-factor de novo or acquire it from their niche
 <cit> . thiamine biosynthesis  in most bacteria is accomplished by two major pathways; one involves the formation of hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophospate  from aminoimidazole ribotide using thic and thid and the other involves the formation of hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate  using this, thif, thig, and thio. the enzyme thiamine phosphate synthase  combines hmp-pp and het-p to produce thiamine phosphate, which is phosphorylated by thiamine monophosphate kinase  to produce thiamine pyrophosphate
 <cit> .

strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained an operon with six orfs  encoding proteins related to enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis in several prokaryotes . a similar thicosgdf operon was also identified in f. novicida-like strain 3523
 <cit> . the genetic organization of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> thicosgdf locus was similar to the plasmid-encoded thicoge locus involved in thiamine biosynthesis in rhizobium etli <cit> . an analogous gene cluster  is found within plasmid pea <dig> of the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora strain ea88
 <cit> . the chromosome of the lithoautotrophic bacterium ralstonia eutropha h <dig> also contains a thicosge locus that is proposed to be involved in de novo synthesis of thiamine
 <cit> . at the protein level, strain atcc  <dig> thic was 68% identical to thic of r. etli  and ra. eutropha , whereas strain atcc  <dig> thif was 34% identical to thif of e. amylovora . furthermore, atcc  <dig> thio and this were 30% identical to thio  and this  of ra. eutropha, respectively . putative thiazole synthase thig of strain atcc  <dig> was ~51% identical to thig of r. etli  and ra. eutropha . 

in strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig>  fphi_ <dig> and f7308_ <dig>  respectively, appeared to encode a putative fused protein containing hydroxy-phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase and thiamine-phosphate pyrophosphorylase domains. in some bacteria, these functions are encoded by two different orfs . homologs of fphi_ <dig> or f7308_ <dig> were found in several bacteria  and plants . it has been proposed that these bifunctional enzymes are involved in the synthesis of hmp-pp as well as the condensation of hmp-pp and het-p to produce thiamine monophosphate
 <cit> . the 5′ untranslated regions of operons involved in thiamine biosynthesis and transport have been shown to contain a regulatory element called thi-box sequence
 <cit> . based on alignment of conserved sequences upstream of operons involved in thiamine biosynthesis from various bacteria, a putative thi-box sequence  was identified upstream of thic in strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig>  this suggests a thiamine-dependent regulation of thic in strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig>  as in other bacteria that have thi-box sequences upstream of tbs genes
 <cit> .

in bacteria that lack a tbs pathway, thiamine kinases may facilitate the salvage of dephosphorylated thiamine intermediates from the environment or growth medium
 <cit> . a gene that encoded a putative thiamine pyrophosphokinase  was found in most members of the genus francisella, including strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> . strain atcc  <dig> tpk was 27% identical to bacillus subtilis tpk , which catalyzes the direct conversion of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate
 <cit> . thus it appeared that most members of the genus francisella are capable of salvage of dephosphorylated thiamine intermediates, but some strains  can synthesize thiamine de novo, when thiamine intermediates are not available in their environments.

vitamin b <dig>  is the precursor of coenzymes flavin mononucleotide  and flavin adenine dinucleotide , which are cofactors for several biochemical reactions
 <cit> . most bacteria, fungi, and plants can synthesize riboflavin de novo using one molecule of gtp and two molecules of ribulose 5-phosphate as substrates
 <cit> . strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained five genes encoding enzymes putatively involved in riboflavin biosynthesis, of which four  were within a single locus . tetrahydrofolate participates in a number of biochemical reactions and reduced folate cofactors are required for the biosynthesis of a variety of molecules in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
 <cit> . the production of folate involves several enzymes catalyzing the pterin and para-aminobenzoic acid branches of the pathway
 <cit> . strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained seven genes encoding enzymes putatively involved in folate biosynthesis, of which four  were clustered together .

vitamin h, commonly known as biotin, acts as a coenzyme in several enzyme-catalyzed carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions
 <cit> . whereas most bacteria can synthesize biotin de novo using pimelic acid as a precursor, some others have evolved mechanisms for importing this essential cofactor from their natural environments
 <cit> . in the classic bioabfcd operon of e. coli, the bioa and biobfcd genes are divergently transcribed and encode the enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of biotin
 <cit> . the chromosomes of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained a cluster of genes that resembled the bioabfcd operon of e. coli . the bioabfcd operons of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> were adjacent to the genes encoding enzymes putatively involved in folate biosynthesis.

environmental bacteria utilize a variety of redox molecules such as porphyrins and other modified tetrapyrroles like heme, siroheme, and adenosylcobalamin for catalysis, energy transfer, and signal transduction
 <cit> . these tetrapyrroles are synthesized de novo using a branched pathway and aminolevulinic acid as the precursor
 <cit> . glutamyl-trna synthetase, glutamyl-trna reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase are involved in the synthesis of aminolevulinic acid using glutamate as the substrate. two molecules of aminolevulinic acid are condensed by the action porphobilinogen synthase to form porphobilinogen. four molecules of porphobilinogen are polymerized by the action of porphobilinogen deaminase to form the tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane. uroporphyrinogen iii methyltransferase cyclizes hydroxymethylbilane to produce uroporphyrinogen iii. siroheme synthase, the last enzyme in the pathway, transforms uroporphyrinogen iii into siroheme. strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained genes encoding putative homologs of some of the enzymes mentioned above .

most of the publicly available f. tularensis genomes contained genes/loci putatively involved in the biosynthesis of riboflavin, folate, biotin, and siroheme . the occurrence of these genes/loci in almost all francisella genomes suggests that these functions are essential for survival in their natural environments. however, the genomes of f. tularensis strains conspicuously lacked genes for the biosynthesis of thiamine. it is possible that these strains lost the ancestral tbs genes as a consequence of host adaptation and reductive evolution. the tbs genes identified in this study could be useful in rescuing the thiamine auxotrphy of f. tularensis strains and other bacteria in the laboratory. furthermore, it was evident from comparative genome analyses that strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> as well as most strains of f. tularensis lacked the vitamin b <dig> biosynthetic pathway. thus it appears that most extant members of the genus francisella are vitamin b <dig> auxotrphs and may require its supplementation for in vitro growth.

genetics of polysaccharide biosynthesis
the lipopolysaccharide  of francisella spp. has several unique features and has been demonstrated to undergo antigenic variation
 <cit> . the biochemical and immunobiological properties of lps from several f. tularensis strains are well characterized and their lps is implicated in pathogenesis
 <cit> . f. philomiragia has been proposed to contain lipooligosaccharide and the lipid a of strain atcc  <dig> has been shown to be rich in shorter fatty acid chains in comparison to f. tularensis <cit> . the wbt gene cluster of f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  is involved in lps biosynthesis and contained  <dig> orfs
 <cit> . in contrast, a similar gene cluster of f. novicida strain u <dig>  contained only  <dig> orfs
 <cit> . the lps o-antigens of f. novicida and f. tularensis have been shown to be structurally and immunologically distinct, due in part to the differences in wbt genes involved in their biosynthesis
 <cit> .

comparative genomic analyses revealed that strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained a cluster of  <dig>  and  <dig>  orfs, respectively, that were related to the wbt gene clusters of f. tularensis strain schu s <dig> and f. novicida strain u <dig> 
additional file 2: table s <dig> contains a comprehensive list of the annotated orfs found in the wbt gene clusters of these bacteria. although strains schu s <dig> and u <dig> contained manb and manc orfs encoding proteins putatively involved in mannose modification adjacent to the wbt gene cluster, strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained only a manb orf. among the other genes found in the wbt gene cluster of f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  only ftt_1450c, ftt_1451c, and ftt_1462c-1464c had homologs among strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig>  the wbt gene cluster of strain atcc  <dig> contained  <dig> genes  that had no homologs in strains tx07- <dig>  schu s <dig>  and u <dig>  similalry, the wbt gene cluster of strain tx07- <dig> contained  <dig> genes that had no homologs in strains atcc  <dig>  schu s <dig>  and u <dig> . in contrast, the wbt gene cluster of strain schu s <dig> contained four genes that had no homologs in strains atcc  <dig>  tx07- <dig>  and u <dig> , whereas the wbt gene cluster of strain u <dig> contained six genes that had no homologs in strains atcc  <dig>  tx07- <dig>  and schu s <dig> .

the wbt gene clusters of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained groups of two , three , and five  contiguous orthologous orfs that had no homologs in f. tularensis strain schu s <dig> and f. novicida strain u <dig>  they also contained three non-contiguous orfs  within their wbt gene clusters that had no homologs in strains schu s <dig> and u <dig>  the wbt gene clusters of strains schu s <dig> and u <dig> contained three contiguous orthologous orfs  that had no homologs in strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig>  furthermore, the wbt gene cluster of strain u <dig> contained a copy of isftu <dig> transposase  that appeared to have truncated the orf encoding a putative dtdp-d-glucose  <dig> -dehydratase  and the wbt gene cluster of strain schu s <dig> contained isftu <dig> transposases . however, the wbt gene clusters of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> were devoid of transposase genes within or adjacent to them .

from genome comparisons, it was apparent that the wbt gene clusters of strains atcc  <dig>  tx07- <dig>  f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  and f. novicida strain u <dig> display a cassette/mosaic structure with an outer conserved region and an inner variable region. since a similar cassette/mosaic structure with an outer conserved region and an inner variable region was also observed among the wbt gene clusters of f. novicida-like strains fx <dig> and 3523
 <cit> , it can be hypothesized that genes in the outer region encode functions common to all strains whereas genes in the inner region encode strain-specific functions. if the number of genes in the inner variable region is an indicator of the complexity of lps, then the lps of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> is likely more different from that of strains schu s <dig> and u <dig>  a similar chimeric arrangement has been observed in the gene clusters encoding polysaccharide antigens in salmonella enterica and it has been proposed that genes in the outer conserved region mediate the conspecific exchange of genes in the inner variable region
 <cit> .

biosynthesis of polysaccharides requires several glycosyltransferases , which catalyze the transfer of sugars from an activated donor to an acceptor molecule and are usually specific for the glycosidic linkages created
 <cit> . the genomes of strains atcc  <dig>  tx07- <dig>  schu s <dig>  and u <dig> contained yet another cluster of 10– <dig> orfs oriented in the same direction that encoded putative gts and other proteins related to enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis and/or cell wall/membrane biogenesis.
additional file 3: table s <dig> contains a list of the annotated orfs found within this gene cluster. a similar gene cluster, which was tentatively designated psl , was also identified in f. novicida-like strains fx <dig> and 3523
 <cit> . whereas strain atcc  <dig> had  <dig> strain-specific orfs  within the psl cluster, strain tx07- <dig> contained only two  strain-specific orfs within this cluster. furthermore, strain schu s <dig> contained  <dig> strain-specific orfs  within the psl cluster and strain u <dig> contained only one  strain-specific orf within this cluster. these strain-specific orfs were flanked by a single orthologous orf encoding a putative had family hydrolase  and a sugar transferase . based on gene content and organization, it may be surmised that the psl gene cluster was involved in lps and/or exopolysaccharide  biosynthesis. since the psl gene cluster of strain atcc  <dig> contained more genes compared to strains tx07- <dig>  schu s <dig>  and u <dig>  it is possible that the lps/eps of this strain is more complex.

atypical arsenic resistance loci
arsenic is an environmental pollutant and some microorganisms have evolved mechanisms of resistance to this cytotoxic agent. arsenic exists in two oxidation states, arsenite  and arsenate , in biological systems
 <cit> . in most bacteria, the minimal arsenical resistance operon contains three orfs  wherein the conversion of arsenate to arsenite is accomplished by a reductase , arsenite is transported out of the cell by a membrane-bound efflux pump , and arsr encodes an arsenic-resistance regulatory protein. plasmid or transposon-mediated horizontal transfer of genes that confer arsenic resistance has been well documented
 <cit> .

strain atcc  <dig> contained a locus encoding a truncated arsenite/antimonite exporter , an arsenate reductase , a sulfate permease , a hypothetical protein , and a mechanosensitive ion channel family protein . this locus was adjacent to the one that encoded several integrative/transposable elements . whereas homologs of fphi_ <dig> and fphi_ <dig> were absent in all other publicly available complete francisella genomes, homologs of fphi_ <dig> and fphi_ <dig> were found in strain tx07- <dig> . strain atcc  <dig> contained yet another locus encoding putative arsenical resistance proteins . strain tx07- <dig> contained an orthologous arsenical resistance locus . at the predicted protein level, fphi_ <dig>  and fphi_ <dig>  had 97% identities to f7308_ <dig>  and f7308_ <dig> , respectively. strain tx07- <dig> contained yet another locus encoding putative arsenical resistance proteins . at the predicted protein level, fphi_ <dig> and fphi_ <dig> had 77% and 52% identities to f7308_ <dig>  and f7308_ <dig> , respectively.

an arsenical resistance locus was also found in f. novicida strain u <dig> . although a gene encoding a putative is <dig> family transposase  was found adjacent to the arsrb locus of strain u <dig>  no such gene was found near the orthologous arsrb loci of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig>  furthermore, at the predicted protein level, strain atcc  <dig> arsb  was 61% identical to the arsenite efflux transporter of bacillus subtilis  and arsr  was 37% identical to arsr repressor of b. subtilis . although bsu <dig> and bsu <dig> have been shown to be involved in arsenate and arsenite resistance in b. subtilis <cit> , biochemical characterization is required to ascertain the role of the putative arsenical resistance loci of francisella strains. in addition, adjacent to fphi_1817- <dig>  strain atcc  <dig> contained a gene encoding a putative protein  that was 42% identical to the small multidrug resistance antiporter  of e. coli. interestingly, none of the f. tularensis genomes sequenced to date contained homologs of arsrb loci or emre. the occurrence of an ortholog of emre in strains u <dig>  and tx07- <dig>  suggests that arsrb and emre loci are ancestral and evolutionarily conserved among some environmental lineages of the genus francisella.

summary of important genetic traits and phylogenetic analyses
based on whole genome comparisons of different strains of francisella, the following genetic traits are obvious. whereas strain tx07- <dig> lacked the lac operon, strain atcc  <dig> lacked genes for glcua utilization. however, strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> contained genes for thiamine biosynthesis. although type a and type b strains of f. tularensis had lost loci for glcua utilization and thiamine biosynthesis, they do contain a vestigial lacz gene.

while f. novicida-like strain fx <dig> contained the lac operon in addition to genes for glcua utilization, f. novicida-like strain  <dig> contained the lac operon along with glcua utilization and thiamine biosynthesis genes
 <cit> . notably, f. novicida strain u <dig> lacked genes/loci for glcua utilization, thiamine biosynthesis, and lactose utilization. however, strain u <dig> contained an arsrb locus, which was absent in strains  <dig> and fx1
 <cit> , but was present in strains atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  and tx07- <dig>  it is possible that strain u <dig>  an environmental isolate of f. novicida, had retained an arsrb locus, but had lost loci for lactose and glcua utilization as well as genes for thiamine biosynthesis because of niche selection. similarly, extant strains of f. tularensis appeared to have lost the arsrb locus, loci for lactose and glcua utilization, in addition to genes for thiamine biosynthesis as a consequence of host adaptation and reductive evolution. based on comparative genome analyses, it may be concluded that the genes/loci encoding putative phenotypes such as arsenite resistance, lactose utilization, biosynthesis of various vitamins/cofactors, type iv pili, oligopeptide abc transporter system, and iron metabolism are more ancient within the genus francisella. figure

2b, but using full-length 16s rrna genes.

several previous phylogenetic analyses based on the 16s rna gene have indicated that f. philomiragia is more ancient than f. tularensis <cit> . analyses based on ~ <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms across the genomes have demonstrated a relatively large evolutionary separation of f. philomiragia from f. tularensis <cit> . furthermore, pairwise analyses of multiple francisella genomes have indicated that the average nucleotide identity between f. tularensis and f. philomiragia ranges between  <dig> % and  <dig> %
 <cit> . since deletion-based phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that f. novicida is ancient to f. tularensis and that both acquisition and loss of genes have occurred during the evolution of different species within the genus francisella <cit> , it is possible that f. novicida represents an intermediate environmental and/or pathogenic lineage between f. philomiragia and f. tularensis. phylogenetic analyses based on full-length 16s rrna and sdha genes support these observations .

CONCLUSIONS
analyses of the genomes of strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> imply that these strains are metabolically versatile and they represent new links in the chain of evolution from an early ancestor to the extant strains of f. novicida and f. tularensis. although strains atcc  <dig> and tx07- <dig> were isolated in different parts of the usa, both were associated with aquatic environments and their recent common ancestry was evident from genome comparisons. it was also evident that strains of f. tularensis have lost several ancestral traits and the consequent reductive evolution may be a cause for as well as an effect of niche selection of these strains. it is likely that the progenitor of f. tularensis strains originated in an aquatic environment and became host-adapted during subsequent evolution. although numerous previous studies have focused on the genetic relationships and evolutionary contexts among f. novicida and f. tularensis strains, comparative genome sequence analyses of f. philomiragia, f. novicida, and f. tularensis strains have provided a comprehensive account of the innate and acquired genetic traits among this important group of bacteria.
