BACKGROUND
protein tyrosine phosphatases  play a central role in cell biology, acting as a complement to the protein kinase system, to control levels of phosphorylated proteins in the cell. by the removal of the phosphate groups that are added by protein kinases, the ptps regulate processes that range from cell growth and differentiation to motility to adhesion, in both normal and disease states  <cit> . there are a wide variety of ptps, and within the human genome  <dig> ptps are classified into four classes. in this study, we focus on two class i ptps. one is the cysteine-based ptps, which are specific for phosphotyrosines. these are the so-called “classical ptps,” and include ptp1b  <cit> . a second category of class i ptp is the dual specificity phosphatases . our studies initially focused on targeting dusp <dig>  which in addition to phospho-tyrosine also dephosphorylates and phospho-threonine residue. ultimately, through serendipity, we identified a dusp <dig> inhibitor that was actually more potent and selective at inhibiting ptp1b as well as protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type  <dig> . the dusps, and their mitogen-activated protein kinase  partners, are involved in various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders . dusp <dig>  in particular, has been shown by the ramchandran lab as important for early vascular patterning in vertebrates, and a clinically relevant serine to proline mutation  has been identified in patients with vascular anomalies  <cit> . recently, it was shown using dusp <dig> knockout mice that dusp <dig> negatively regulates interleukin-33-mediated eosinophil survival and function,  <cit> , and upon viral infection, dusp <dig> is essential for t cell survival  <cit> . furthermore, dusp <dig> knockout rats displayed autoregulation of cerebral blood flow  <cit> . thus, dusp <dig> is an important new drug target, and was pursued by the studies presented herein – at least until it was discovered that our lead compound was a more potent inhibitor of ptp1b.

ptp1b is a drug target for treatment of cancer  <cit>  as well as type ii diabetes and obesity  <cit> . while there are presently no approved drugs targeting ptp1b  <cit> , it has been hotly pursued as a drug target by many pharmaceutical companies and academic labs  <cit>  in the hope that an inhibitor of ptp1b could be developed as a drug for treating type ii diabetes, which is anticipated to affect over  <dig> million people world-wide by  <dig>  <cit> . ptp1b works by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor, and studies with knockout mice have shown that decreased ptp1b activity is associated with weight loss and enhanced insulin sensitivity  <cit> . ptp1b was the first ptp to be cloned and characterized  <cit> , and was first characterized by crystallography in  <dig>  <cit> . despite this extensive knowledge base, and the recognition of ptp1b’s important role as a drug target, there are still no approved drugs that target ptp1b. it has been suggested that there are unique challenges to developing drugs for ptps, in part due to the requirement that inhibitors be highly charged, which creates bioavailability problems for drug lead molecules  <cit> . adding to this challenge, it has been noted that a large number of small molecules identified as ptp inhibitors were later found to be false positives, that inhibit nonspecifically  or via oxidation of the active site cysteine residue  <cit> . such screening artifacts are not unique to ptps, and are a growing concern as increasing numbers of labs participate in drug discovery and development efforts.

the studies presented herein provide a useful case study concerning the purity and chemical identities of small molecules and their degradation, role of careful analysis of apparent screening artifacts such as time-dependent inhibition, and the importance of serendipity in drug discovery.

methods
preparation of rr <dig> and rr601
commercial rr535
synthesis of rr <dig>  was achieved in a multi-step synthesis only in very poor yield and therefore the protocol was abandoned. fortunately, an acid derivative of rr <dig>  was commercially available. it was converted to rr <dig> by a reaction with equimolar sodium hydroxide in water under an inert atmosphere followed by precipitation by a layering technique with pure acetone. the resulting precipitate was further purified by repeated re-precipitation  with a mixture of water and layering with acetone to afford a pure sample of rr <dig> 

synthesis of rr601
a solution of 5-amino-1-naphthol-3-sulfonic acid hydrate, tci  was added an aqueous solution of naoh  under an argon atmosphere. the resulting mixture was stirred vigorously and the ph of the solution was checked to ensure the complete conversion of the acid into rr <dig>  water was evaporated by bubbling a constant stream of argon through the solution for 12 h to yield rr <dig> in quantitative amount. the resulting rr <dig>  was re-dissolved in deionized water  in a quartz tube equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. the resulting solution was vigorously stirred while a stream of air  was passed through the reaction mixture and the tube was exposed to a 120 w lamp for 18 h. the dark colored reaction mixture was slowly evaporated by bubbling argon through the solution at 45 °c to produce a black brown solid. this solid was further purified by repeated re-precipitation  from a mixture of water and acetone to afford a pure rr <dig> in 45% yield. nmr and mass spectrometry  was used to characterize rr <dig> scheme  <dig> scheme  <dig> synthesis of rr601




in vitro erk dephosphorylation western blot assay
gst-dusp <dig> purified protein was generated using previously published methods  <cit> . the protein was diluted in phospho-erk buffer  to a concentration of  <dig> – <dig>  nm, depending on the purity. active erk <dig>  and the compounds to be tested were also diluted in this buffer with an initial concentration of  <dig> nm for erk <dig> and serial dilutions for the compounds. 5 μl each of gst-dusp <dig> and diluted compound concentrations were incubated for  <dig> mins after which 5 μl of  <dig> nm erk <dig> was added and allowed to incubate for  <dig> mins. after this time 15 μl sds-loading buffer was added to each reaction. samples were boiled for  <dig> mins, loaded into lanes of 12% mini-protean tgx gels , and run at 120 v. protein samples were then transferred to pvdf western blotting membranes  at 90 v for 1 h. membranes were treated and utilized in the ibind flex western device  according to manufacturer protocols. membranes were probed for total and phospho-erk using rabbit anti-human p44/ <dig> mapk and mouse anti-human phospho-p44/ <dig> mapk primary antibodies and hrp-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies . images were developed using a fluorchem hd <dig> imager  after application of supersignal west femto and west pico chemiluminescent substrate .

ic <dig> calculation from the western blot assay
densitometry analysis of western blot images was performed using imagej software. ic <dig> values were obtained using graphpad prism  <dig> software to perform a non-linear least squares regression, which generated a sigmoidal dose-response curve. from this analysis ic <dig> values were obtained for each inhibitor being tested: nci <dig> , rr <dig>  and rr <dig> . in contrast to the ic <dig> assay determined in solution and described in the next section, this assay was done with full-length protein , and using perk as substrate. thus, it is expected that slightly different ic <dig> values might be obtained, since the conformation of the active site is expected to be affected by the presence of the erk binding domain, in the presence of perk.

dusp <dig> phosphatase domain protein synthesis and details of pnpp assay
the dusp <dig> phosphatase domain ) gene was synthesized by blue heron  and the protein expressed and purified as previously described  <cit> . to measure the enzymatic activity of wild type phosphatase domain of dusp <dig> {dusp <dig> pd} and the inhibitory capacity of selected compounds, an in vitro phosphatase assay was utilized as previously described  <cit> . briefly, assays without and with inhibitors were performed in greiner 96-well clear bottom plates with a total assay volume of 200 μl. the assay buffer contained 100 mm tris, 100 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl <dig> • 6h2o and 1 mm dithiothreitol  at ph  <dig> . p-nitrophenyl phosphate  5 mm was used as the substrate. dusp <dig> pd dephosphorylates pnpp to yield p-nitrophenolate, which absorbs at 405 nm, having an extinction coefficient of  <dig>  m- <dig> cm- <dig>  the reaction was initiated by the addition of 4 μl of a 29 μm dupsp <dig> pd enzyme stock and absorbance was monitored at 25 °c over time using a spectramax m <dig> microplate reader . blanks contained only buffer and pnpp. negative controls  contained assay buffer with pnpp and dusp <dig> pd.

inhibition of dusp5pd by nci <dig> , and effects of compound source and storage conditions
the first small molecule inhibitor tested was procured from three independent sources. first from the nci diversity chemical library , then from a commercial vendor , and was synthesized in our laboratories . these compounds should, in theory, all be the same chemical structure, 1-amio-5-napththol-7-sulfonic acid. stock solutions  of each inhibitor compound, including rr <dig>  and nsc- <dig>  were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide . we first noticed a time-dependent darkening of the stock solutions of nci <dig> stored in room light as well as stock solutions of rr <dig> and the mp biomedicals compound that had been exposed to room light for varying amounts of time. this initial observation prompted us to study the effect of light exposure and compound source on inhibitor potency. upon the addition of 4 μl of these respective inhibitor stock solutions to the assay buffer, the resulting range in assay inhibitor concentrations were  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  μm for the various 1-amino-5-naphthol-7-sulfonic acid sources,  <dig>  μm to 300 μm for rr <dig> and  <dig>  μm to 300 μm for nsc- <dig>  appropriate vehicles were added to the blank and negative control wells. a minimum of three replicate wells was run for each condition and at each inhibitor concentration. the replicate wells were averaged to give a single data point. the reaction was initiated upon addition of 4 μl of a 29 μm enzyme stock which was dispensed to each of the wells except the blanks utilizing a single channel pipette. the resulting dusp <dig> pd concentration in the assay buffer was  <dig>  μm. the plate was returned to the plate reader, shaken, and absorbance recorded at  <dig> °c every thirty seconds over a ten to sixty mins time course. in selected experiments the plate was returned to the plate reader following a  <dig> mins recording for one or two additional  <dig> mins absorbance recordings.

rr <dig> and nsc- <dig> inhibition of ptp1b and shp- <dig> activity
to examine the capacity of rr <dig> to inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1b , , activity, an in vitro phosphatase assay was adapted from  <cit> . assays with and without inhibitor were performed in corning 96-well clear bottom plates having a non-binding surface, with a total assay volume of 200 μl. the assay buffer contained 100 mm tris, 100 mm nacl, 1 mm edta at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm pnpp as the substrate. serial dilutions of each of the rr <dig> and nsc- <dig> stocks were performed such that upon the addition of 4 μl of a respective inhibitor stock to the assay buffer, the resulting range in assay inhibitor concentrations were  <dig>  μm to 100 μm for rr <dig> and  <dig>  μm to 300 μm for nsc- <dig>  the reaction was initiated upon addition of 4 μl of a  <dig>  μm ptp1b stock, which was dispensed to each of the wells except the blanks using a single channel pipette. the resulting ptpb <dig> concentration in the assay buffer was  <dig>  μm. the plate was returned to the plate reader, shaken, and absorbance recorded at 25 °c every thirty seconds over a  <dig> mins period when rr <dig> was used, or for  <dig> mins when nsc- <dig> was used as the inhibitor . since nsc- <dig> has also been reported to inhibit shp- <dig>  we also examined the capacity of rr <dig> and nsc- <dig> to inhibit shp- <dig> . assays were performed in 96-well plates in a similar manner as reported above. the assay buffer contained 50 mm hepes , 2 mm edta, 3 mm dtt and 100 mm nacl. an initial experiment was performed to determine the kinetic parameters of the shp- <dig> enzyme. the reaction was initiated with the addition of 4 μl of a  <dig>  μm stock shp- <dig> enzyme into wells containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 81 μm pnpp. the shp- <dig> assay concentration was  <dig> nm. absorbance was recorded every 30 s over a ten minute assay period at a temperature of 25 °c . initial velocities were fit to the michaelis-menten equation:  <dig> v=vmaxskm+s where v is the initial velocity, v
max the maximum velocity, k
m the michaelis constant, and  the pnpp concentration. following the determination of the michaelis constant of the shp- <dig> enzyme in the pnpp assay, inhibition studies with rr <dig> and nsc- <dig> were performed over concentration ranges of  <dig> –100 μm and  <dig> –300 μm, respectively. assay buffer contained  <dig>  mm pnpp, roughly one-half the value of the michaelis constant determined from the study above. reactions were initiated with the addition of 4 μl shp- <dig> enzyme, resulting in a final assay enzyme concentration of  <dig> nm. absorbance was recorded every 30 s over a 10 min reaction period at 25 °c in the rr <dig> study and every 30 s over a 60 min reaction period with nsc- <dig> 

ic <dig> calculation
initial rate values obtained from the plate reader were normalized to percent activity relative to the mean negative control rates. graphpad prism  <dig> software was utilized to calculate a non-linear regression  using a variable slope model equation, constraining the top and bottom values to 100% activity and 0% activity, respectively, using the following equation:  <dig> vi=bottom+top−bottom1+10logic50−x*hillslope where v
i is the initial rate.

nephelometry
nephelometry was performed to determine the relative propensity of the inhibitor compounds to aggregate in solution, based on the light scattering properties of the molecular aggregates. compound aggregation can lead to artifact inhibitory effects, thus confounding a study of mechanism of inhibition. compounds were tested for aggregation in a 96-well plate format, final volume 200 μl, using the phosphatase activity assay buffer at ph  <dig>  without added pnpp. compound concentrations ranging from 1 μm to 300 μm were generated by the addition of 4 μl volumes of serially diluted compound samples that were prepared from stock solutions of rr <dig>  or rr <dig> and mp biomedical stock solutions that had either been stored in the dark or exposed to light for 17 days. eight wells were used for blanks and for each compound concentration. plates were analyzed at two separate gains to determine if the signals were at saturating levels. progesterone was used as a positive control for compound aggregation. data were collected using a bmg nephelostar plus, equipped with a 635 nm laser.

mechanism of dusp <dig> pd inhibition by rr601
to investigate the mechanism of dusp <dig> pd inhibition by rr <dig>  initial velocity inhibition profiles of rr <dig> were obtained in a 96-well plate format by measuring dusp <dig> pd initial velocities in assay buffer containing of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 81 mm pnpp and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 75 μm rr <dig> at each pnpp concentration. reactions were initiated by the addition of dusp <dig> pd to a final concentration of  <dig>  μm in each of the wells, excluding the blank. the data were fitted to a global competitive inhibition model  using the following equation:  <dig> vi=vmaxskm1+iki+s where v is the initial velocity, v
max the maximum velocity, k
m the michaelis constant,  the concentration of pnpp,  the concentration of rr <dig> and k
i the inhibition constant.

the mechanism of rr <dig> inhibition of shp- <dig> was investigated in a similar manner. initial velocities of shp- <dig> were determined in assay buffer containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 30 mm pnpp along with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and 3 μm rr <dig> at each pnpp concentration. the data were fitted to a global competitive inhibition model . for substrate concentrations less than 30 mm, the data fit best to a competitive inhibition model .

spectroscopic study of the effect of light exposure on compound properties
it was observed that solutions of 1-amino-5-naphthol-7-sulfonic acid  prepared from solid material procured from different sources were different in color. therefore, compound solutions were studied spectrophotometrically. in addition, it was also observed that solutions of rr <dig> and mp biomedicals stored on the bench top became darker with time. this prompted a more systematic examination of the time-dependent nature of the color change. freshly prepared 15 mm solutions of rr <dig> and mp biomedicals were prepared in dmso, from which  <dig>  mm solutions in dmso were prepared. samples of each  <dig>  mm solution were added to quartz cuvettes and the absorbance of each sample was recorded from 400 nm to 700 nm . each  <dig>  mm sample was then divided into two equal volumes, one volume of each was stored in a cryovial on the benchtop exposed to room light while a second volume of each was stored in a cryovial wrapped in foil and placed in a drawer protected from light. absorbance was recorded seven days later, after which the samples were returned to their respective bench top or drawer locations, and again at seventeen days following sample preparation. the remaining 15 mm rr <dig> and mp biomedicals samples were stored on the bench top for seventeen days after which their inhibitory capacity against dusp <dig> pd activity was determined.

additional analytical measurements

1h nmr spectra of the mp biomedicals, rr <dig> and rr <dig> compounds were collected for comparison. also, mass spectrometry  of methanol extracts of mp biomedicals and rr <dig> compounds were performed using a nitroanthracene matrix.

RESULTS
initial identification of nci2602
in our previous work, we had identified suramin , an fda-approved compound that inhibited the dusp <dig> enzyme  <cit> . suramin was previously reported as an active site-directed, reversible, and tight binding inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases  <cit> , and is an fda approved drug for treatment of african trypanosomiasis  <cit> . because suramin has off target effects  <cit> , and aggregates  <cit> , we investigated the individual chemical moieties that comprise suramin, and first procured a compound from the nci diversity chemical library  that resembled this moiety . we first investigated the ability of nci <dig> to inhibit dusp <dig> in our published pnpp and perk assays  <cit> . in the pnpp assay , we observed an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm , while in our perk western blot assay , we observed an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  μm ±  <dig>  μm, as the average obtained from the global fit of three separate experiments. these data suggest that nci <dig> is a moderately potent inhibitor of dusp <dig> activity. to confirm our findings above, we resynthesized nci <dig>  referred to as rr <dig>  and also purchased compound from a commercial vendor  and re-analyzed these compounds which should, in theory, be identical to nci <dig> and behave the same in the dusp <dig> pd-pnpp and dusp5-perk assays. surprisingly, the compound obtained from mp biomedicals and the resynthesized nci <dig>  were found to be less effective inhibitors than the originally discovered nci compound . the mp biomedicals compound ic <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, while the rr <dig> compound failed to show inhibition over the concentration range tested. these data collectively suggest that nci <dig> and the purchased compound are not identical in structure, form and purity.fig.  <dig> chemical structures of suramin and nci2602

changes in nci <dig> color over time
to investigate the differences between nci <dig> and the resynthesized or purchased compound, we first focused on the color of these compounds from different sources. the nci <dig> was dark grey to black in color, the mp biomedicals was modestly lighter and the synthesized rr <dig> was white in color. photographic images of 25 mm samples of each compound in dmso , as well as absorbance spectra of each compound  correlate with the observed color differences observed in the solids. we rationalized that the change in color could be associated with impurities in the nci <dig> preparations or light-induced changes that result in alterations in color. to address the later possibility, we incubated stock solutions of rr <dig> and mp biomedicals in the dark or on the bench top exposed to room light.

stock solutions  of rr <dig> and mp biomedicals were prepared in dmso and serially diluted to  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm using dmso. half of each sample was pipetted into matched  <dig>  ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, generating two sets of serially diluted rr <dig> and mp biomedicals solutions. one set of each was stored on the bench top while the matched set was stored in a drawer protected from light. photographic images of the samples of the mp biomedical samples  or the rr <dig> samples  following storage for 7 days on either the bench top or the drawer were collected. the samples showed evidence of light-induced darkening when compared to the paired samples that were stored protected from light. absorbance spectra collected from  <dig>  mm samples of mp biomedicals  and rr <dig>  stored for  <dig> and 17 days, diluted with dmso to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm, displayed a light- and time-dependent increase in absorbance over the visible range. these results suggest that color of the resynthesized and the purchased compound changed over time to light exposure, and matched the nci <dig> compound color.fig.  <dig> light-sensitive nature of mp biomedicals and rr <dig> compounds . photographic images of two sets of  mp biomedicals and  rr <dig> compounds at concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm in dmso which were either stored in the dark  or on the bench top exposed to a twelve hour cycle of room light  over a one week period. light exposure resulted in darkening of both compounds relative to the matched sample sets which were stored in the dark. c absorbance spectra from  <dig> to 700 nm of  <dig>  mm concentrations of mp biomedicals and d) rr <dig> that were either stored in the dark or exposed to room light for seven and seventeen days. scans of each compound on the day they were prepared from solid compound are included for comparison, demonstrating the light- and time-dependent increase in absorbance of both compounds




effect of light exposure on rr <dig> and mp biomedicals on in vitro potency: dusp <dig> pd activity assays
the observed color changes brought about by light exposure led us to examine whether light exposure impacted the inhibitory capacity of mp biomedicals and rr <dig> compounds with respect to dusp <dig> pd activity. figure  <dig> shows ic <dig> curves generated from dusp <dig> pd activity versus increasing concentrations of mp biomedicals  and rr <dig>   prepared from stock solutions that had either been stored in the dark or exposed to room light for 17 days, using pnpp as the dusp <dig> pd substrate. the data shown in fig. 4a and b were collected during the first  <dig> mins of the reaction period. the calculated ic <dig> values for the mp biomedicals compound that had been stored in the dark or exposed to room light were 588 ± 351 μm and 221 ± 11 μm, respectively. rr <dig> that was stored in the dark did not inhibit dusp <dig> pd activity over the concentration range studied, while rr <dig> compound exposed to room light had an ic <dig> value of 725 ± 206 μm. when dusp <dig> pd activity was assayed between  <dig> and  <dig> mins during the reaction, the calculated ic <dig> values for the mp biomedicals compound that had been stored in the dark or exposed to room light were 360 ± 36 μm and 31 ± 1 μm, respectively . rr <dig> that was stored in the dark did not inhibit activity over the concentration range tested, while the ic <dig> for light-exposed rr <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  when assayed between  <dig> and  <dig> mins. there was no significant difference between the initial assay reaction rates of the negative controls recorded from  <dig> to 10 min or  <dig> to 25 min. these data collectively suggest that light induced changes in the activity associated with these compounds.fig.  <dig> effect of light exposure and assay reaction time on mp biomedicals and rr <dig> ic <dig> values for dusp <dig>  dusp <dig> pd initial velocity, monitored utilizing pnpp as the substrate, versus increasing concentrations of  mp biomedicals and b) rr <dig>  prepared from stock solutions that were either stored in the dark or exposed to room light for 17 days. ic <dig> values were determined from rate data collected during the first ten minutes of the reaction period. the calculated ic50 ± se for mp biomedicals that was stored in the dark was 588 ± 351 μm, compared to 221 ± 11 μm for the same compound when stored exposed to room light . rr <dig> that was stored in the dark did not inhibit dusp <dig> pd activity over the concentration range tested, while the ic <dig> for light-exposed rr <dig> was 725 ± 206 μm . c mp biomedicals ic <dig> values determined as in  from rate data collected between  <dig> and 25 min during the reaction period for compound stored in the dark or exposed to room light were 360 ± 36 μm and 31 ± 1 μm, respectively. d rr <dig> ic <dig> values determined as in  from rate data collected between  <dig> and 25 min. compound stored in the dark did not inhibit dusp <dig> pd activity while light exposed rr <dig> had an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. data points represent the mean ± sd of four trials with four wells at each mp biomedicals and rr <dig> concentration




the exact nature of the light-induced change on the structure of rr <dig> was not known, but was hypothesized to involve the dimerization reaction shown below based on the fact that arylamines are known to undergo ready oxidation when exposed to air and light forming highly colored azo dyes. accordingly, a deliberate light-induced transformation of pure rr <dig> was carried out in the presence of air  and the structure of the resulting dimeric azo dye  was established by mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy.

this newly synthesized compound was called “rr601” and was tested as an inhibitor of dusp <dig> 

because we observed increased activity over time for the original monomeric inhibitors , we performed a time-dependent light incubation profile for these compounds. inhibition as a function of time exposed to light in the plate reader  shows changes for dusp <dig> pd inhibition activity for mp biomedicals , rr <dig> , and rr <dig>  inhibitors. mp biomedicals and rr <dig> compounds were prepared from stock solutions exposed to light for 90 days while the rr <dig> stock was prepared from recently synthesized compound. compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit dusp <dig> pd activity in the plate assay and ic <dig> values calculated from dose response curves generated from activity data collected over the first  <dig> mins of the assay reaction period, then from  <dig> to  <dig> mins and from  <dig> to  <dig> mins, respectively . ic <dig> values for mp biomedicals and rr <dig> decreased with time however, rr <dig> was unique in that its ability to inhibit did not change as a function of time exposed to the light source in the plate reader.fig.  <dig> light-exposed mp biomedicals and rr <dig> inhibit dusp <dig> pd in a time-dependent manner while inhibition by rr <dig> is not time-dependent. dusp <dig> pd initial velocity monitored utilizing pnpp as the substrate versus increasing concentrations of  mp biomedicals,  rr <dig>  prepared from compounds exposed to room light for 90 days, and  freshly prepared rr <dig> . ic50 ± se values were determined from rate data collected during the first ten minutes, between  <dig> and 25 min and again between  <dig> and 40 min during the reaction period . data points represent the mean ± sd of three trials with eight wells at each compound concentration


assay reaction period

inhibitor compounds
ic <dig> values  for mp biomedicals, rr <dig>  and rr <dig> were determined in the presence of dusp <dig> pd as described in fig.  <dig>  data was collected during three successive 10 min assays with pnpp as the substrate




we also performed perk assay with rr <dig> and rr <dig> compounds , and found that indeed they inhibit dusp <dig> activity with ic50’s  <dig>  μm for rr <dig> and  <dig>  μm for rr <dig>  thus, collectively our results suggest that the azo-bridged dimer of rr <dig>  referred to as rr <dig>  is actually the more potent inhibitor of dusp <dig> 

nephelometry measurements of rr <dig>  mp biomedicals and rr <dig> aggregation
since compound aggregation is a common source of false positive inhibition, especially for polysulfonated aromatic compounds  <cit> , nephelometry experiments were performed on all compounds , to rule out this type of artifact inhibition. nephelometry experiments were performed as described in our previous publication  <cit> , to measure the propensity for rr <dig>  mp biomedicals and rr <dig> compounds to aggregate in solution. in all panels, the positive control compound progesterone is seen to aggregate at approximately 100 μm, and shown as an inflection in the curve. in fig.  <dig> panels a, b, d and e no other inflection is observed; in contrast, several points begin to show light scattering in panels c and f. figures 6b and e show nephelometry  measurements for rr <dig> prepared from stock solutions that had been stored in the dark or exposed to room light for seventeen days. there was little or no measurable aggregation of either sample over the concentration range tested. similarly, fig. 6a and d show nephelometry measurements as a function of increasing concentrations of mp biomedicals prepared from stock solutions that had been stored in the dark or exposed to room light for seventeen days. here also, there was little or no measurable compound aggregation over the concentration range tested. in contrast, rr <dig>  began to aggregate at approximately 30 μm. since aggregation occurs at a concentration that is higher than the ic <dig>  inhibition is not due to aggregation effects.fig.  <dig> mp biomedicals, rr <dig>  and rr <dig> nephelometry at two gain settings. aggregation of mp biomedicals , rr <dig>  and rr <dig>  was measured in  <dig> well plates with increasing concentrations of compound at gain levels of  <dig> , and  <dig> . mp biomedicals and rr <dig> samples were prepared from stock solutions that were either stored in the dark or exposed to room light for 17 days. stock solutions of rr <dig> were stored in the dark. progesterone  was used as the control. data points at each compound concentration are the mean ± sd of eight wells. single wells were used for each progesterone concentration




mechanism of rr601-mediated dusp <dig> pd inhibition
rr <dig> inhibition of dusp <dig> pd with pnpp as the substrate showed no time dependence . rr <dig> was shown to be a competitive inhibitor versus dusp <dig> pd, in initial velocity studies varying concentrations of pnpp and rr <dig>  a global competitive inhibition fit was performed, fitting the data to eq.  <dig> , resulting in best fit estimated values  for v

rr601- and nsc-87877-mediated ptp1b and shp- <dig> inhibition
on searching the literature and compound databases, we noticed chemical structure similarities between nsc- <dig>  and ptp1b   <cit> ) and rr <dig>  which inhibits dusp <dig> pd . this observation prompted us to investigate whether the newly synthesized rr <dig> would also inhibit ptp1b and shp- <dig>  figure  <dig> show ptp1b and shp- <dig> activity versus increasing concentrations of rr <dig> using pnpp as the substrate, and indicate surprisingly strong inhibition of ptp1b and the related phosphatase, shp- <dig> activity by rr <dig>  the ic <dig>  values determined from the fitted curves are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in the presence of ptp1b and shp- <dig>  respectively. these values are significantly below the aggregation point of 30 μm for rr <dig>  based on nephelometry. thus, rr <dig> is a more potent and selective inhibitor of ptp1b  and shp- <dig>  than it is for its originally intended target, dusp <dig> . ptp1b and dusp <dig>  while sharing the mechanism of being cysteine-based phosphatases, have very different tertiary and primary structures . thus, while the discovery that rr <dig> is a more potent inhibitor of ptp1b than of dusp <dig> was serendipitous, it is not surprising that 18-fold selectivity could be obtained for ptp1b over dusp <dig>  given these structural differences.fig.  <dig> rr <dig> inhibits ptp1b and shp- <dig>  ptp1b and shp- <dig> initial velocities versus rr <dig> concentration were fit to eq.  resulting in estimated rr <dig> ic50 ± se values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for ptp1b and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for shp- <dig>  activity was monitored utilizing pnpp as the substrate. data points represent the mean ± sd of three or four trials with three to eight wells at each rr <dig> concentration

interestingly, nsc- <dig> in the same assay did not initially inhibit ptp1b activity  at the tested concentrations; however, continuous monitoring of the assay over time revealed ic <dig> values of 723 ±  <dig> and 337 ± 130 μm after  <dig> and  <dig> mins, respectively, of the reaction assay. also, nsc- <dig> did inhibit shp- <dig> activity with an ic <dig> value of 168 ± 30 μm, with no change in the ic <dig> value after  <dig> mins . nsc- <dig> did not inhibit dusp <dig> pd activity . collectively, these data suggest that rr <dig> shows more selectivity for ptp1b and shp- <dig> over dusp <dig>  similar to the less potent nsc- <dig> 

discussion
protein tyrosine phosphatases  are drug targets for a wide range of diseases, ranging from vascular anomalies and cancer  to diabetes  . unfortunately, ptps are also extremely challenging targets for developing drugs, as evidenced by the fact that there are currently no fda-approved drugs that target ptps  <cit> . furthermore, drug screening for ptp targets often produces false positive or false negative results. studies presented herein address a false positive and negative result, wherein that actual active molecule is a product of light-induced chemical reaction formed in situ, or upon extended storage of a compound by the compound provider.

our initial studies focused on identifying inhibitors of dusp <dig>  as drug lead molecules to treat vascular anomalies. compounds were screened in silico first, via docking studies, followed by enzyme inhibition studies. a lead compound – nci <dig> – was identified from the national cancer institute  database, and then obtained and experimentally tested and found to be an inhibitor of dusp <dig>  but, the compound was observed to have variable potency depending on its source . furthermore, upon careful study of mechanism of inhibition, the compound was found to have a potency that increased over time, and only after exposure to light and oxygen. such exposure led to a color change for the compound , which correlated with increased potency . re-synthesis of the compound  led to the surprising result that the in-house synthesized compound actually had little enzyme inhibition activity, compared to compounds from other sources . but, after exposure to light and oxygen, it acquired enzyme inhibition activity. thus, we speculated that the compound underwent a chemical modification in situ, and that modification was identified as a light-induced dimerization to produce the azo-bridge sulfonated napthol, rr <dig>  this hypothesis was tested by synthesizing and testing the dimeric rr <dig> compound, which was found to be much more potent than the monomeric compound  that was initially screened. since sulfonated compounds are known to produce false positive inhibition via aggregation effects  <cit> , it was of course possible that rr <dig> was not a true inhibitor. but, based upon nephelometry experiments, the sulfonated compounds tested – including rr <dig> – showed less propensity for aggregation relative to the control aggregator progesterone . thus, the rr <dig> dimeric compound is a relatively potent inhibitor of dusp <dig> activity, with an ic <dig> of 36 μm. proton nmr  and mass spectrometry  revealed differences between the mp biomedicals and rr <dig> compounds. careful control experiments to monitor compound stability, coupled with re-synthesis of the original compound, and re-synthesis of the proposed in situ reaction product, was crucial for identifying the actual lead molecule , which is not the compound structure that was advertised by the suppliers. the above results provide a cautionary lesson on the importance of verifying compound identity using chemical re-synthesis.

rr <dig> had modest potency as a dusp <dig> inhibitor, our originally intended drug target. but, its structural similarity to nsc- <dig> implied that rr <dig> could target other cysteine phosphatases within the class i ptps, such as ptp1b, a known target of nsc- <dig>  ptp1b is a widely pursued target for treating diabetes  <cit> . these two ptps, while in the same family and having similar mechanisms, have very little structural similarity , suggesting it should be possible for an inhibitor to inhibit one selectively over the other. testing rr <dig> against ptp1b, for selectivity, demonstrated that the dimeric rr <dig> was actually a more potent inhibitor of ptp1b than of dusp <dig>  with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm against ptp1b. interestingly, rr <dig> is an azo-bridged dimer of sulfonated naphthol rings, and resembles previously reported ptp inhibitors  <cit> , but with 18-fold selectivity for ptp1b. since shp- <dig> is also a reported target of nsc- <dig>  we tested rr <dig> against shp- <dig> and determined an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm. rr <dig> is therefore selective versus dusp <dig>  but shows no selectivity between the class  <dig> phosphatases, ptp1b and shp- <dig>  thus, we have discovered a new molecule, in an established class of ptp1b  inhibitors, by serendipity. in particular, our path to a potent and selective ptp1b inhibitor began by first targeting dusp <dig>  and screening a commercial library. through a series of control experiments, we discovered one weak inhibitor that displayed light- and time-dependent inhibition of dusp <dig>  due to in situ formation of a colored and more active form of inhibitor. based on a chemical understanding of the potential light-induced reactivity of the compound in question, it was demonstrated that the compound formed an azo-bridged dimer. such dye-like compounds, comprised of polysulfonated aromatic rings tethered by an azo bridge, are actually well-known ptp inhibitors  <cit> . in fact, a recent study of food dyes in this class revealed that half of such compounds were actually ptp inhibitors, with several inhibiting in the low micromolar range  <cit> . of particular interest, compound nsc- <dig>  bears some resemblance to the azo-bridged polysulfonated aromatic ptp inhibitor discovered herein, and has been reported as a potent and selective inhibitor  of the shp- <dig> ptp  <cit> . although, it should be noted that our data indicate that nsc- <dig> may be less potent than previously reported, and is less potent that the rr <dig> compound reported herein.

importantly, the active compound we identified in our screening efforts was not the structure advertised by the supplier; however, it is still a unique and valuable lead molecule. our results therefore illustrate the importance of verifying compound identity in drug discovery efforts, and add another cautionary note in the growing concerns being expressed over reproducibility of published research studies, particular for preclinical drug development work  <cit> . a study by amgen scientists of published academic research in oncology found that <50% of published studies could be reproduced  <cit> , with similar results obtained in a report compiled by researchers at bayer  <cit> . some of these inconsistencies could be attributed to false positives that can occur due to chemical contaminants that are nonspecific and reactive  <cit> . in others, results like what we report here could explain the discrepancies. mis-assignment of chemical structure  can also occur for compounds that show up as false positive or negative hits in screening campaigns, because inhibitors are only formed in situ during the screening process – as we have observed in the studies reported herein. such issues can have serious consequences. for example, an anti-cancer compound was patented and approved for human clinical studies; but, the janda lab at scripps later showed the chemical structure of that drug lead molecule had actually been mis-assigned  <cit> . the wrong molecule had been patented and approved for clinical studies. although this is an extreme case, the problem of compound identity mis-assignment in drug discovery and development is considered to be common when high throughput screening methods are used  <cit> . our take home lesson from our screening efforts is that compound structure verification by nmr or other methods, followed by characterization of physical properties, re-synthesis and re-testing against the original target is a must. the value of comparative structure assessments is underappreciated, and perhaps can pivot drug discovery efforts in a new direction, as was the case here. collectively, our studies here point to a flexible, and highly dynamic model for drug discovery that encompasses multiple labs, orthogonal complementary approaches, and keen observation with deductive reasoning as key elements to making drug discovery valuable and fun in academics.

CONCLUSIONS
studies presented herein provide lessons on the importance of verifying mechanism of inhibition and compound identity when performing screening campaigns to identify enzyme inhibitors; and, on the value of being open to serendipity. compound re-synthesis and verification was used to diagnose and characterize the in situ dimerization of a dusp <dig> enzyme inhibitor, resulting in the serendipitous discovery of a new lead molecule for inhibiting both dusp <dig> and ptp1b. initial docking and then enzymatic screening of compounds from the national cancer institute  resulted in identification of an inhibitor of dusp <dig> that showed time-dependent inhibition, with an ic <dig> of 36 μm. the active form of the compound was shown to be an azo-bridged dimer of sulfonated naphthol rings, which formed upon exposure to light. it behaves as a competitive inhibitor of dusp5; and, is an even more potent inhibitor of ptp1b, with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm.
