BACKGROUND
mammalian reproduction is a complicated physiological process involving many important events, such as generation of mature gametes, fertilization, zygotic gene activation , and embryonic development. thus far, the key molecules and mechanisms involved in these events remain poorly characterized. mammalian oocytes, a highly specialized cell type, play unique roles in reproduction because only in these cells are maternal proteins and transcripts crucial for the above-mentioned processes.

during oogenesis, oocytes synthesize and accumulate a number of maternal proteins. some of them function in the formation of follicles and/or the growth of the oocytes, including, figÎ±, gdf <dig>  and bmp <dig>  <cit> . however, many maternal proteins stored in oocytes play significant roles in later stages, namely fertilization and early embryogenesis. the corresponding genes are called maternal effect genes  <cit> , and we call the proteins they code for maternal effect proteins. maternal effect genes/proteins have been shown to be important in early embryonic development of drosophila melanogaster and xenoupus laevis  <cit> . several maternal-effect genes/proteins have recently been identified in mammals, and their importance in embryonic development has also been demonstrated. mater  is one of the first characterized maternal effect proteins in mice, the absence of which precludes embryonic progression beyond the 2-cell stage  <cit> . npm <dig> is another well characterized maternal effect protein, which is required for nuclear and nucleolar organization during embryonic development  <cit> . much research has been done to identify maternal effect genes or proteins essential for preimplantation or postimplantation mouse embryo development. dppa <dig>  padi <dig>  tle <dig> and floped were successfully identified in individual studies  <cit> , but there remain many unknown players. therefore, the identification and molecular characterization of novel maternal proteins will be of great significance and novel proteomic technologies can potentially deduce most of the maternal proteins in mature oocytes.

there are several recent reports utilizing proteomics approaches to the study of ooctyes, including the exploration of the bovine, pig and mouse oocyte proteomes  <cit> . for example, calvert et al. identified  <dig> highly abundant heat shock proteins  and related chaperones in the mature mouse egg by two-dimensional electrophoresis   <cit> . vitale et al. used 2de and mass spectrometry  to identify  <dig> proteins that appeared to be differentially expressed between germinal vesicle  and metaphase ii  murine oocytes  <cit> . in our previous work that demonstrated post-translational modifications of maternal proteins, we used a similar approach to perform large-scale protein identification in mature mouse oocytes, and we successfully identified a total of  <dig> different proteins corresponding to  <dig> proteins spots  <cit> . the 2de platform is valuable to analyze heterogeneity of proteins in the forms of alternative splicing, post-translation modifications, etc  <cit> . although 2de continues to be a very popular tool for studying the proteome, it has some limitations in identifying proteins that have either high or low molecular masses, those with extreme isoelectric points , those are highly hydrophobic, and those of low abundance  <cit> . 1d sds-page liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry -a combination of 1de protein separation and lc-ms/ms analysis-has been used widely and is generally accepted as a more effective method of studying the proteome  <cit> . it is technically simple and combines improved protein separation capability that also captures those proteins typically not accessible via 2d page  with the well-established sensitivity of gel-based protein identification using ms for less complex samples  <cit> . for the purpose of identifying novel maternal proteins, we employed this high-performance proteomic approach to analyze proteins extracted from  <dig> mature mouse oocytes lacking zona pellucidae and we successfully identified  <dig> different proteins. the maternal protein compilation provided here is intended to serve as an important tool for expanding our knowledge of the regulation of multiple processes in mammalian reproduction.

RESULTS
identification of mature oocyte proteins
the mouse oocyte zona pellucida  is a thick extracellular coat containing, on average, ~ <dig>  ng of glycoprotein which contributes approximately 15% of the total egg protein  <cit> . given that high-abundance proteins may interfere with the identification of other proteins, the zp was removed by treating with acid tyrode solution  <cit> . in total,  <dig> zp-free mii oocytes were collected and the integrity of the oocytes was checked rigorously according to the criteria outlined in the materials and methods to ensure only morphologically normal oocytes were chosen for further research . oocytes passing these selection criteria were lysed and their proteins were separated by 1d sds-page. the gel was then cut into  <dig> slices, proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides extracted from each gel slice were analyzed by automated reverse phase lc  coupled with ms/ms. from  <dig> lc-ms/ms runs, a total of  <dig> ms/ms spectra were acquired and searched against the ipi mouse database v <dig>  by sequest. to experimentally verify the false discovery rate  in our dataset, all output files were searched against the reversed ipi mouse database, yielding an fdr of ~ <dig> %. we applied additional filter criteria to exclude proteins identified with low probabilities. the confidence score of the protein was calculated by applying the peptideprophet algorithm using scaffold software   <cit> , and only proteins with confidence scores of more than 90% were included in our dataset. identical peptide sequences are occasionally shared by biologically distinct proteins, thus it is occasionally difficult to determine the identities of proteins based on sequenced peptides unless unique peptides are identified. in our analysis, proteins with shared peptides were organized into a single group  in scaffold. if a protein group comprised only isoforms or overlapping database entries indistinguishable by ms/ms analysis, then the proteins in this group were counted as a single protein. if these proteins were the products of distinct genes, then all the proteins in the group were discarded from our dataset. consequently, the final number of identified proteins was lower than the actual number of proteins in the sample. in summary, our dataset included  <dig> proteins corresponding to  <dig> known genes and  <dig> proteins from uncharacterized genes . ms/ms spectra and fragment assignments of single peptide-based identifications are provided .

we were interested to compare the mature oocyte proteins identified in the present study with those discovered by other analyses, including the 2de study conducted in our lab as well as two other published reports  <cit> . protein ids in the datasets from each study were converted to gene symbols. as shown in figure  <dig>  a sum of  <dig> unique gene products were reported previously. of these,  <dig>  were also found in our present dataset, whereas  <dig> gene products were found only in our present study. therefore a total of  <dig> different maternal proteins have been identified from mature mouse oocytes thus far.

go and pathway analysis of the identified proteins
in figure  <dig> we have the categorized proteins identified in this study in terms of cellular components based on gene ontology  analysis. a majority of proteins  were assigned to the cytoplasmic compartment, accounting for 35% of the identified proteins. among the proteins classified by go annotation, 16%  were membrane proteins, followed by proteins of unknown localization , nuclear , and mitochondrial  proteins.

to examine what biologically importantly entries are enriched in the mouse oocyte, we compared our dataset with a combined database of multiple mouse tissues as a reference. generation of this combined proteomic database was based on the avaliable proteomic data from different tissues or cells created with the same or similar lc-ms/ms exprimental approach. this strategy can overcome the biases caused by the experimental approach  <cit> . as a result, ~ <dig>  genes with duplicates were included in the combined dataset. babelomics http://babelomics.bioinfo.cipf.es/entrypoint?loadform=fatigo, an advanced set of tools for the functional profiling of high-throughput transcriptomic, genomic and proteomic data  <cit> , was used to carry out the calculation. when compared to the pooled proteomic database,  <dig> go terms  for molecular function appeared to be significantly overrepresented, and none significantly underrepresented. in the biological process category,  <dig> go terms  appeared to be significantly underrepresented, and none significantly overrepresented . we found that transcription in the mouse oocyte was also underrepresented. recent studies have demonstrated that oocytes undergo large-scale chromatin modifications in the process of maturation, including acetylation and methylation of the histone proteins, and finally global transcriptional repression appears  <cit> . so, the global transcriptional activity of the mii oocytes is very low, and this is consistent with our results.

a key function of maternal proteins accumulated in mature oocyte is the regulation of early embryogenesis. a detailed analysis of embryonic development influenced by the protein profile of the mouse oocyte was performed using pathway studio, an automated text-mining tool which enables the software to generate pathways from entries in the pubmed database as well as other public sources. pathway analysis revealed that  <dig>  unique gene products were involved in early embryogenesis events .

analysis of high abundance proteins
the number of unique peptides identified is generally accepted as a semiquantitative measure of protein abundance  <cit> . we sorted the  <dig> proteins in our dataset according to the number of unique peptides identified. the highest ranked  <dig> proteins represented by more than  <dig> unique peptides are listed . among the high abundance proteins, some members have already been well characterized in oocytes. for example, dna methyltransferase  <dig> , is the predominant form of dna -methyltransferase in mammals and is essential for embryo development  <cit> . this protein was represented by  <dig> unique peptides and was the second-most abundant protein in our dataset.

screening for proteins with special mrna expression patterns
unique or atypical mrna expression patterns of maternal proteins suggest their key roles in oogenesis or early embryo development and this notion has been validated by other functional research on maternal effect proteins  <cit> . we adopted an in silico approach to investigate the expression patterns of proteins in our dataset by examining their expression in the mouse transcriptome database symatlas http://symatlas.gnf.org/symatlas/, which describes gene expression patterns in  <dig> mouse tissues  <cit> . surprisingly, many of the proteins in our dataset exhibited patterns worthy of note. we were particularly interested in genes highly expressed in oocytes and fertilized eggs . in total,  <dig> proteins, representing approximately 12% of the entire dataset, were included in this subset . as expected, many well known maternal effect proteins in mice were found in this subset. included in this subset were the earliest identified maternal protein mater, as well as the recently identified tle <dig>  <cit> . in addition to these well-known maternal effect proteins, many of the proteins we identified as highly expressed in oocytes and fertilized eggs have not been characterized.

to explore the functions of the  <dig> proteins with abundant mrna expression levels, we analyzed their domain composition with babelomics. statistical analysis indicated that the most significantly overrepresented domain was the f-box domain  and the  <dig> maternal proteins containing f-box domains are listed . different f-box proteins, as components of the skp1-cullin1-f-box  complex, can recruit particular substrates for ubiquitination and play central roles in cell-cycle regulation  <cit> .

intersection between the oocyte and esc proteome
somatic cells can be reprogrammed by transferring their nuclear contents into oocytes  <cit>  or by fusion with embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . this fact indicates that unfertilized eggs and es cells probably contain similar factors that can confer totipotency or pluripotency to somatic cells. in order to identify a common set proteins shared between oocytes and es cells, mouse mii oocyte proteins were compared with recently published data for proteins expressed in mouse es cells  <cit> . this analysis resulted in an overlap of  <dig> proteins . as expected, developmental pluripotency associated  <dig> , which has been implicated in cell pluripotency, was included in this set. of the  <dig> proteins,  <dig>  were either exclusively found in mouse es cells or highly enriched in es cells compared to differentiated es cells   <cit> . it is likely that novel factors associated with reprogramming are included in this subset.

discussion
activation of the embryonic genome in mice begins late in one-cell zygote and is fully underway by the two-cell cleavage stage  <cit> . the silencing of nuclear transcription occurring between meiotic maturation in oocytes and activation of the embryonic genome implies critical roles for preexisting stores of proteins and transcripts  <cit> . through knockout and knockdown strategies, individual maternal proteins have been demonstrated as essential for cleavage stage development in mice. in the present study, we identified many new and unknown maternal proteins in mice by constructing an mii oocyte proteome. in-depth analysis of these maternal proteins will assist us in screening for a proportion of great interest.

interestingly, many maternal transcripts deposited in mammalian oocytes are not polyadenylated and therefore not translated into proteins  <cit> . independent confirmation of the protein expression of maternal genes is therefore necessary. this was also an important reason for us to construct the oocyte proteome. as a case in point, nalp <dig>  nalp <dig> , and nalp4f were included in our subset of abundantly expressed maternal proteins. these three proteins belong to the multifunctional nacht nucleoside triphosphatase  family. nalp <dig> and nalp <dig> were previously reported as maternal effect proteins and play significant roles in mouse preimplantation embryo development  <cit> . nalp4f was represented by  <dig> unique peptides in our present study and a previous analysis demonstrated that nalp4f was an oocyte-specific gene  <cit> . our research has independently confirmed the high protein expression level of nalp4f in mature oocytes. assuming that nalp4f has similar roles to nalp <dig> and nalp <dig>  it is highly likely that nalp4f is an important factor necessary for normal embryogenesis and is a good candidate to be a maternal effect protein. in addition, we identified nalp <dig>  nalp4b, and nalp9b in our oocyte proteome. although the precise functions of nacht ntpase family members remain to be determined, we speculate that these members play significant roles in early embryo development based on their homology to nalp <dig> and nalp <dig> a distinguishing characteristic of maternal effect proteins identified to date is that the majority of them have an abundant mrna expression in oocytes and many are expressed only in oocytes  <cit> . this fact led us to filter maternal products in our protein list by analyzing their corresponding mrna expression patterns. as a result,  <dig> maternal proteins with high mrna expression levels in oocytes and fertilized eggs were selected out. of these proteins, we discovered that  <dig> previously described maternal effect proteins  were enriched in this subset. these maternal effect proteins have been reported to be absolutely necessary for oogenesis, fertilization or early embryo development. indeed, apart from these well-known examples, the majority of proteins in this subset have not been previously studied or reported in oocytes. we suggest that these proteins are excellent candidates as maternal effect proteins.

a group of proteins belonging to the t-cell leukemia/lymphoma  <dig>  protein family was of particular interest because their corresponding genes had dramatically similar mrna expression patterns. figure  <dig> demonstrates that tcl <dig>  tclb <dig>  tclb <dig> are almost oocyte-specific genes. tcl <dig> was initially identified as a gene involved in recurrent chromosomal translocation in human prolymphocytic leukemia  and overexpression of tcl <dig> played a causative role in t cell leukemias of humans and mice  <cit> . however, in tcl1-deficient mice, a female fertility defect was observed. tcl1-deficient females display normal oogenesis and rates of oocyte maturation/ovulation and fertilization, but the lack of maternally derived tcl <dig> impairs the embryo's ability to undergo normal cleavage and develop to the morula stage, especially under in vitro culture conditions  <cit> . the tcl <dig> loss-of-function phenotype indicates that maternal protein tcl <dig> plays a significant role in early embryo development. unfortunately the functions of tclb <dig> and tclb <dig> have not yet been investigated and we can speculate that the two proteins may play similar or complementary roles in embryogenesis.

domain composition analysis is an effective way to predict the functions of proteins identified in a proteomics analysis. among  <dig> proteins singled out because their corresponding genes are highly expressed in oocytes,  <dig> proteins  contained an f-box domain, which was first described as a sequence motif in cyclin-f that interacts with the skp <dig> protein. different f-box proteins, as substrate-specific adaptor subunits of the skp1-cullin1-f-box  complexes, recruit particular substrates for ubiquitination via specific protein-protein interaction domains. coincidentally, three core protein subunits  of the scf complex were all definitively identified in our proteome. as one of the major classes of ubiquitin ligases, the scf complex plays a central role in cell-cycle regulation  <cit> . in early stages of embryo development, degradation of maternal proteins is crucial for the oocyte-to-embryo transition  <cit> . our results suggest that the maternal scf complex probably exists in oocytes and may be important for the oocyte-to-embryo transition by recruiting specific substrates for degradation.

pluripotent stem cells are of considerable current interest as they can proliferate indefinitely in vitro and give rise to many adult cell types, serving as a potentially unlimited source for tissue replacement in regenerative medicine. recently, takahashi et al. demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells can be induced from mouse fibroblasts by retroviral introduction of oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig>  <cit> , indicating that the combination of these four factors can induce reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state. however, the use of retrovirus-transduced oncogenes represents a serious barrier to the eventual use of reprogrammed cells for therapeutic application because of tumor formation by c-myc reactivation  <cit> . therefore it is necessary to discover factors responsible for reprogramming that would be safer for therapeutic use. we compared the maternal proteins in our oocyte proteome with a recently published mouse es cell proteome and identified an overlap of  <dig> proteins. in addition to some pluripotency markers, this group included many uncharacterized proteins, some of which may be good candidates for studying the mechanism of reprogramming. a good example is translationally-controlled tumor protein , which facilitates the first step of somatic cell reprogramming  <cit> . recent studies on tpt <dig> demonstrate that this protein activates transcription of oct <dig> and nanog in transplanted somatic nuclei  <cit> . we believe that further analysis of these candidate proteins at the functional level will uncover novel proteins that are essential for reprogramming and indirectly promote the application of therapeutic cloning.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used 1d sds-page and rp-lc-ms/ms to investigate the maternal proteins stored in mature mouse oocytes. this high-performance strategy allowed us to define a set of  <dig> different mouse mii oocyte proteins. this is the largest catalog of mature mouse oocyte proteins compiled to date. we believe that this study will help us to understand the diverse biological processes occurring in mouse oocytes and during early embryo development. however, compared with proteomic analyses of other cells and tissues, such as embryonic stem cells and liver, the proteins identified in mature mouse oocytes were limited. this was mainly because of the fact that mature oocytes obtained from each mouse were very limited. we believe that the catalog of maternal proteins present in this article is a starting point and we anticipate that more research on the oocyte proteome will deduce most of the maternal proteins.
