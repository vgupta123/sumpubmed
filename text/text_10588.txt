BACKGROUND
gene co-expression network analysis has recently emerged as a new data analysis field that presents an opportunity to extract gene interactions from the large number of gene expression datasets available in the ever growing public databases. expression data from hundreds of unrelated experiments, covering a range of conditions, can be combined into a single analysis. however, in most cases these data sets have only undergone basic differential gene expression data analysis. this approach has failed to capitalise on the abundance of information available in each dataset since analyses are often limited to a small subset of genes which are selected using arbitrary thresholds. this approach is prone to false findings and, in many cases, hard to reproduce  <cit> . gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology approach which complements traditional differential gene expression analysis. phenotypic variation is controlled at many levels, some of which are independent of transcript abundance. for example, hudson et al. <cit>  stated that transcription factor  modifications such as reversible phosphorylation and missense mutations can act independently of tf expression levels and that such a process can be overlooked by standard differential gene expression analysis. hence, instead of exclusively defining differentially expressed genes, the identification of groups of highly co-expressed  genes or gene modules may facilitate the identification of genes under a common regulatory mechanisms by linking upstream sequence motifs with the known binding sites of transcription factors. by combining a high number of experiments into a single robust analysis, it is possible to minimise the effects of variables that can plague individual experiments  <cit> .

two major types of co-expression networks have emerged: 1) condition-dependant networks and 2) condition-independent, or condition-free, networks. the former, requires careful selection of datasets to cover a single experimental variable, for example, limited to experiments that investigated environmental stresses, such as temperature, ph, oxygen availability etc. the aim being to identifying clusters of highly co-expressed genes  that control the stress responses. this kind of analysis can be extended to yield new gene annotations as in childs at al.  <cit> , and provide additional insights into the connections between gene expression and the investigated variable. the latter uses data from a number of different tissues, conditions, strains, and other variables. this type of network analysis has the ability to identify genes whose co-expression is independent of experimental variables and stable. this approach is often used to investigate regulatory elements  <cit> . advances in module detection algorithms have elevated microarray analysis to much higher levels than simple identification of differentially expressed genes and gene ontology  enrichment analysis.

a hub gene, that is a gene which is among the most highly connected within a module, is likely to be tightly involved in the regulatory mechanisms of all those genes with which it is tightly co-expressed. the identification of common sequence motifs in a module and the integration with other biological metadata such as mrna databases, protein and metabolic networks can add to our understanding of these networks.

in this study we have generated a condition-free co-expression network to shed light on the rather poorly annotated chicken genome through the investigation of clusters of highly co-expressed genes. we have determined putative functions and possible regulatory mechanisms. the network is available on integromedb public database  under the present manuscript title.

RESULTS
we used  <dig>  publically available affymetrix genechip chicken genome array hybridization results  to construct a condition-free, gene co-expression network using the weighted gene correlation network analysis  algorithm. we identified  <dig> clusters of highly co-expressed genes  containing  <dig>   genes from the  <dig>  most variable genes used to construct the network. the resulting network was sparse with  <dig>  gene connections out of a maximum of approx.  <dig>  million pairwise connections. the resulting network is presented in figure  <dig> 

network structure
most of the  <dig> modules identified in the co-expression network have a high level of intra-module connectivity  and low inter-module connectivity. however, four of the larger modules  possess a large number of inter-module connections and are found to contain genes involved in major cellular functions such as cell cycle, transport, extracellular components, stress response, protein processing, and dna repair. two further modules , containing genes enriched for actin cytoskeleton and alpha-catenin binding go terms, are highly connected to module  <dig>  such high levels of connectivity between these three modules as well as their closely related functional enrichment, suggest that these three modules could be merged.

we found that modules  <dig> and  <dig>  enriched for genes annotated with antigen processing and immune response functions respectively, possess genes whose co-expression link the two modules together.

several modules were found to contain little or no connections to the rest of the network , representing genes whose expression is not linked to any other module either directly or via an intermediary gene. examples are modules  <dig> and 15; enriched for genes involved in extracellular matrix and muscle protein. the existence of stand-alone modules does not imply that they are isolated from the biological network, but rather that we do not have all genes present in our network since we limited our analysis to the most highly variable genes.

we found that the topology/structure of the network/modules and biological interpretations were robust to different network construction parameters and analyses . we found that increasing the number of genes, from which to construct the network, tended to increase the number of inter-modular connections and thus reduce the number of stand-alone modules. however, the main network topology/structure remained unaffected.

biological significance of network modules
the biological significance of the modules was investigated by performing gene ontology  enrichment and clustering analysis using david  <cit> . most of the  <dig> modules showed extremely high levels of go enrichment with go categories enriched as much as  <dig> fold and p-values as low as  <dig> e- <dig>  this is supported by data given in additional file 1: table s <dig> and summarised in table  <dig>  one of the david features is functional annotation clustering that places similar go categories, based on the parent/child go term associations and the number of the shared genes, into a functional cluster. the go cluster enrichment score is based on geometric mean of member's p-values and is used to rank their biological significance. david only reports significantly enriched clusters; most enriched clusters have the highest score and lowest p-values. we used this feature to estimate the relationship between the go terms.

additional file 1: table s <dig> contains full tables with all of the go categories and clusters of go categories enriched.

module  <dig> contained  <dig> genes involved in a number of cell cycle related biological processes such as cell cycle, cell cycle phase, cell cycle process, m-phase, mitotic cell cycle, nuclear division, mitosis, organelle fission and cell division with p-values ranging from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> and enriched up to  <dig> fold. david joined these into a single go cluster with an enrichment score of  <dig> . similarly, david also identified a second go cluster containing chromosome, centromere region of chromosome, chromosomal part, centromere, chromosomal protein, cytoskeleton go terms etc . all significant go clusters were involved in crucial processes in the mitotic cell cycle .

although, module  <dig> is much smaller in size, with only  <dig> genes, we still found it to be significantly enriched  with muscle related go terms such as: muscle protein, skeletal muscle, myofibril, contractile fiber, sarcomere, cytoskeletal protein binding, muscle contraction, cardiac muscle, heart etc.

module  <dig> displayed strong lipid related go enrichment  with 42% of the module’s genes belonging to lipid biosynthetic process  while the steroid biosynthesis go term is enriched  <dig> fold . module 14’s go terms were clustered into  <dig> annotation clusters: 1) sterol metabolic process go categories; 2) fatty acid metabolism related gos; 3) membrane biological component and 4) nucleotide related go categories and binding.

module  <dig> showed enrichment  for extracellular region go terms and this accounted for more than 20% of the annotated genes in the module. for example,  <dig> genes that encode collagen constituents of the extracellular matrix all belong to this module, namely col1a <dig>  col2a <dig>  col3a <dig>  col5a <dig>  col5a <dig>  col6a <dig>  col6a <dig>  col8a <dig>  col12a <dig>  col16a <dig>  col24a <dig> and col24a1/// loc <dig>  the members of this module are all very tightly co-expressed. the annotation clustering of related gos identified clusters such as extracellular matrix gos , basement membrane , cell adhesion , collagen , glycosaminoglycan, heparin and carbohydrate binding , growth factor binding  etc. all these clusters of go categories suggest genes involved in the regulation and maintenance of membrane and extracellular structures.

two modules,  <dig> and  <dig>  contained genes of high importance for the immune response. within module  <dig>   <dig> % of the genes belonged to an immune response go  and includes the genes blb <dig>  blb <dig>  tlr2- <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd <dig> and il <dig>  other enriched  go categories include immunoglobulin-like, toll-interleukin receptor, positive regulation of immune system process, and antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via mhc class ii. enrichment of similar go categories was seen in module  <dig> with antigen processing and presentation , mhc class i protein complex , and immune response .

module  <dig> is the largest with  <dig> genes of which  <dig> are involved in cell transport ,  <dig> are involved in nucleotide binding  and  <dig> are involved in protein localization . based on the go categories associated with this module  it is possible that this is a control module for the cell metabolism controlling transcription and translation within the cell.

major hubs in the chicken co-expression network
we identified  <dig> hub genes in the network and found that go assignment and clustering showed overlapping ontology functions. for instance, the hub genes were enriched by up to  <dig> fold for the following go clusters: cell cycle, binding , chromosome segregation and sister chromatid segregation, cytoskeleton and microtubule organisation, condensed chromosome, microtubule and motor activity and dna replication. all of this confirms well-known associations of hub genes with expression regulatory mechanisms and allows for speculation into the putative regulatory roles of hub genes which have previously been entirely un-annotated or not annotated with a regulatory role. there were  <dig> hubs without any functional annotations,  <dig> of those had unigene ids: gga. <dig>  gga. <dig>  gga. <dig>  gga. <dig> and gga. <dig>  running blastn of all available sequences for the  <dig> unigene ids on several databases  we found similarities between gga. <dig> and a number of parafibromin genes from different species with sequence identity up to 99%. alternative name of parafibromin is cell division cycle protein  <dig> homolog and it is involved transcriptional and post-transcriptional control as reported on uniport database. unigene gga. <dig> showed highest  sequence identity to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> from meleagris gallopavo  and also from rabbit, guinea pig, horse, dog, rat etc. remaining unigene ids had no blast hits.

the top three hub genes, in order of connectivity, in the chicken co-expression network are: 1) ring finger protein  <dig>  with connections to a total of  <dig> other genes; 2) importin  <dig>  with  <dig> connections; 3) splicing factor 5a  with  <dig> connections. in addition, we also found hub genes which were un-annotated. the most connected of these un-annotated hub genes is gga. <dig> with  <dig> connections to other genes. such highly connected hub genes should be investigated more closely as they are likely to have key roles in regulating gene expression in the chicken.

regulatory elements associated with network modules
in order to identify possible known transcription factor binding sites  statistically overrepresented among the genes from each module, the command line version of the clover software  <cit>  and jasper core database  <cit>  were used. the binding motifs were considered significantly overrepresented in a module if clover p-value was lower than  <dig> . the results are summarised in the table  <dig> 

the table shows top  <dig> overrepresented motifs, complete table is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the motif names and capitalisation are as they appear in jaspar database.

motif discovery associated with network modules
the meme software suite  <cit>  was used to identify novel upstream motifs which might account for the co-expression/regulation of gene expression of genes within each module.

when module  <dig> genes were inspected for the presence of cis motifs, a very ordered structure in the upstream region of  <dig> un-annotated genes was observed. closer inspection of these genes using ensembl and the chicken genome viewer , shows them to be annotated only as novel genes and “protein coding ensembl id”. all of these genes without functional annotations show a surprising level of similarity: ensembl gene homologue search indicated that they are all homologous to immunoglobulin-like receptors chir-a <dig>  chir-ab <dig>  chir-ab- <dig>  chir-ab <dig>  chir-b <dig>  chir-b <dig>  chir-b <dig>  chir-b <dig>  chir-b <dig> and chir-b <dig>  this confirms that sequence homology continues into the upstream region which is unusually enriched in cis-elements. however, closer gene by gene inspection showed that one affymetrix feature, gga. <dig> .s1_s_at, was mapped to  <dig> ensembl gene ids from the  <dig> un-annotated genes above, indicating again high sequence homology between these genes that allowed binding to the same array probe. considering that the remaining well annotated genes from module  <dig> are significantly enriched in immune response , the fact that the un-annotated genes share sequence homology with a group of immunoglobulin-like receptors confirms the selectivity and validity of the network modules. the analysis was also repeated using  <dig> ensembl gene id per one array feature. we identified a novel motif overrepresented with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  present in 80% of inspected module  <dig> sequences with  <dig> sites . using the gene ontology for motifs  algorithm we found the motif was overrepresented in the upstream regions of genes from go category “immune system process”  and “immune response” .

module  <dig> contains genes from lipid biosynthesis and sterol related gos; we identified a novel motif  that is overrepresented  in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding go and another motif  overrepresented  in genes that make up the regulation of lipid kinase activity go.

the motif that showed the most significant go association  was detected in muscle related module  <dig>  this motif  was found to be overrepresented in cis regions of genes annotated with the following go categories: muscle organ development, muscle cell differentiation, muscle tissue development, striated muscle tissue development, skeletal muscle tissue development, skeletal muscle organ development, regulation of smooth muscle cell migration, muscle fiber development, skeletal muscle fiber development, muscle organ morphogenesis, cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis, muscle tissue morphogenesis, regulation of skeletal muscle fibre development, striated muscle thin filament, and regulation of muscle cell differentiation. this motif was enriched within the module with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  a number of other novel motifs were discovered as significantly enriched in different modules; however, the extent of the data far exceeds the scope of this manuscript and allocations for supplementary data. the complete motif analysis can be provided on request to the corresponding author.

discussion
the data published in the co-expression network area has clearly confirmed that highly co-expressed genes are enriched for certain cellular functions. one of the major breakthroughs in our understanding of cellular networks was finding that cellular networks display scale-free topology  <cit> . properties of scale-free networks are highly dependent on a small number of hubs; the nodes with disproportionally high number of connections. it has been demonstrated, using yeast co-expression networks, confirmed with knockout strain studies, that these network hubs are mostly essential genes  <cit> . this organisation of cellular networks shows a surprising degree of tolerance to random errors/perturbation  <cit> . the high number of poorly connected nodes assures that most faulty nodes are quickly by-passed. even the loss of up to 80% of the nodes will not destroy a scale-free network. however, if such a node happens to be one of the relatively small number of hubs, whether targeted or by chance, the network topology will be seriously affected and will result in network failure  <cit> . the present network identified a number of key genes in control of chicken gene expression. we found hub genes which were un-annotated, the most highly connected of these is gga. <dig>  such highly connected hub genes should be investigated more closely as they are likely to have key roles in regulating gene expression in the chicken.

the network presented here shows that gene expression in the chicken genome is highly organised and is regulated in concert across a range of tissues and variables. it was previously shown that this “guilt by association” heuristic is universal and preserved beyond organism boundaries  <cit>  and that transcriptional control is overwhelmingly modular and appropriate for characterizing gene functions based on module assignment  <cit> . a human co-expression network, cited by over  <dig> manuscripts, generated by lee at al.,  <cit>  using  <dig> human public datasets and over  <dig> arrays also shows modularity through the hierarchical clustering and cluster enrichment in certain biological functions. the module functional association of this human network is very comparable with the present chicken network. both networks contain modules or sub-modules enriched in cell cycle, transcription regulation, immune response, mhcii, transcription, rna processing, metal binding and cytoskeleton. this is not surprising considering the genome homology between the human and chicken. it also confirms that, when using condition-free networks across a large number of arrays, tissues and conditions, the modules are likely to be associated with universal and essential cellular processes shared across organisms.

it has been shown that multiple shared transcription factor binding sites are necessary for co-expression to occur and that there is a positive correlation in sequence similarity and co-expression  <cit> . there were a total of  <dig> tfbs of known experimentally proven transcription factors, significantly overrepresented across the modules. some of tfbs were overrepresented in most of the modules. based on the fact that network modules are associated with major cellular processes, transcription factors acting on these tfbs are expected to be of universal significance, independent of external variables, involved in control of some of the major cellular processes.

in modules enriched in more specialised go categories the tfbss matched the module assignment. module  <dig> was enriched in muscle related gos such as muscle protein and skeletal muscle. this module had myf, known to be a muscle-specific transcription factor  <cit> , as the top scoring transcription factor . the top scoring transcription factor in module  <dig>  involved in immune response, was spi <dig> also known as pu- <dig> . spi <dig> is known to activate gene expression during myeloid and b-lymphoid cell development  <cit>  and controls macrophage differentiation  <cit> . in module  <dig>  controlling antigen processing and immune response, the top scoring transcription factors  were irf <dig> and irf <dig>  both are members of interferon regulatory transcription factor  family. this provides confidence that novel and un-annotated transcription factors found to be linked to specific go categories, are involved in the regulation of gene expression within a module. de novo cis element searching also provided additional information confirming exclusive immune response assignment of module  <dig>  novel motifs found in this analysis can be further investigated and matched to aid in the discovery of novel transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
the chicken co-expression network is a useful tool for generating gene function predictions, especially since the chicken genome is relatively poorly annotated. the presented network points to important and essential genes , novel transcription factors and their binding sites, and predicts likely functional roles of a large number of currently un-annotated chicken genes.
