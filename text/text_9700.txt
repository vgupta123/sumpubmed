BACKGROUND
phenotypic plasticity is the phenomenon whereby organisms with the same genotype can achieve different phenotypic endpoints in response to changes in external or internal environments. phenotypic plasticity thus allows organisms to respond rapidly to changing environmental circumstances. understanding the genomic basis of phenotypic plasticity can yield insights regarding the underlying genes and genetic networks affecting complex phenotypes, since mutations in genes whose expression changes in different environments also affect the phenotype .

most previous studies of genome wide transcriptional responses to environmental perturbations have utilized microarray technology, which has a lower dynamic range than direct sequencing of mrnas and can be influenced by dna polymorphisms between the target genotype and the reference genotype used to design the array. we used whole genome rna sequencing to alleviate these limitations and included a comprehensive analysis of micrornas . micrornas bind to the 3′ untranslated regions of mrna, preventing its translation, polyadenylation or stability, and play essential roles in signaling pathways that regulate development and differentiation  <cit> . although mirnas have been implicated in lifespan determination in caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila
 <cit> , little is known regarding their role in phenotypic plasticity. finally, epigenetic modifications have been proposed as an important aspect of phenotypic plasticity through their regulation of gene expression . however, we know little of the complex relationships between genome-wide transcriptional responses to environmental perturbations and their regulation by mirnas and epigenetic modifications.

here, we utilized next generation sequencing technology to assess the plastic responses of mrnas, mirnas and three major histone modifications  to mating and aging in d. melanogaster females, in a factorial design. mating and aging have previously been shown to elicit transcriptional responses in drosophila
. during mating, male d. melanogaster transfer a complex mixture of accessory gland derived peptides and proteins together with sperm into the female reproductive tract. these peptides exert profound physiological and behavioral changes in the female which are thought to enhance the male’s competitive reproductive success . they activate oocyte development and accelerate egg laying, reduce receptivity of the female to additional matings, and enhance the female’s immune competence . in addition, mated females have a reduced lifespan compared to virgin females  <cit> . the effects of several accessory gland peptides have been well characterized, including ovulin  <cit>  and the sex peptide  <cit> . the latter exerts its effect by binding to receptors that are expressed in the reproductive tract and in the central nervous system  <cit> . while the abundances of many hundreds of transcripts are known to change with age , it is not known to what extent these patterns vary between virgin and mated flies and whether the reduced longevity of mated females reflects an acceleration of normal senescence. we used our data to construct interaction networks between phenotypically plastic mirnas, their target genes and associated histone  <dig> markers. we functionally validated the effects of mirnas on oviposition in mated females to demonstrate that mirnas are instrumental in facilitating post-mating physiological and behavioral changes in female d. melanogaster.

RESULTS
we assessed changes in genome wide mrna, mirna and epigenetic modifications for 3– <dig> day old and 4-week old virgin canton s   <cit> 
d. melanogaster females and females which were maintained in the continuous presence of males with multiple opportunities for mating. we refer to the latter as “mated” females. we evaluated overall differences in transcriptional and epigenetic responses to mating and to aging, as well as differences in the molecular signatures of plasticity between young and old virgin and mated flies, and mated and virgin young and old flies. this design enables us to assess whether or to what extent mating induces changes in molecular response profiles that would otherwise occur later in life.

mrna plasticity
we obtained mrna expression profiles for each of the four physiological conditions by rna sequencing. an average  <dig> % of sequences had quality scores higher than  <dig> , with over 65× coverage of the estimated 30 mb drosophila transcriptome. we detected  <dig>  mrna sequences, including  <dig>  annotated transcripts and  <dig>  previously unannotated transcripts. some of the unannotated transcripts could be artifacts of mapping short reads corresponding to premature unspliced mrnas back to the genome; others represent novel intergenic long non-coding rnas. we identified  <dig> unique genes that were differentially expressed post-mating or as a function of age. these include  <dig> genes with predicted transcripts of unknown function,  <dig> annotated non-coding transcripts and two novel  genes. the remaining  <dig> genes included multiple members of gene families, such as the im, jonah, cp, cpr, twdl, osi, vm, mal and obp families . among the differentially expressed genes,  <dig> showed altered transcript levels in young flies after mating;  <dig> showed altered transcript levels between young and old virgin flies; and  <dig> genes showed altered expression between young and old mated flies . there was modest overlap among these categories . only  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts were identified between aged virgin and mated flies. this suggests that the largest post-mating differences in transcript profiles are observed in young females and these differences fade as flies age.

we performed gene ontology  enrichment analyses for the two treatments with the largest numbers of environmentally responsive transcripts: the plastic response to mating for young flies  and the plastic response to aging of virgin flies . transcripts with altered expression levels following mating show strong enrichment of go terms associated with egg development and proteolysis, in agreement with a previous study  <cit> ; as well as go terms associated with bacterial defense and immune responses . go categories associated with immune/defense response, egg shell formation and metabolism were enriched in the comparison between young and old virgin flies , also in agreement with previous studies . there is partial concordance between go categories between the transcript profiles of young flies before and after mating and young and aged virgin flies, indicating that some biological processes undergo specific post-mating or aging-related changes in transcript abundance levels, whereas others reflect post-mating changes that would occur later in the lifespan in the absence of mating.figure  <dig>

mirna plasticity
we extracted and sequenced small rnas  from the same samples used to assess genomic responses of mrnas to mating and aging. examination of the distribution profiles of small rnas showed prominent peaks at 22 bp and 30 bp, corresponding to mirnas and rasirnas , respectively . a prominent peak of small rna fragments around 15 bp is evident in replicate samples of flies following mating. these fragments are transient and are not observed for older mated flies, nor are they observed in young or old virgin flies. these small mrna fragments are likely due to degradation of maternal rna in embryos during the maternal to zygotic transition following fertilization  <cit> . we mapped the 15-18 bp rna fragments across all samples to the genome sequence and identified  <dig> genes that give rise to degradation fragments exclusively in young flies after mating . among these genes,  <dig> encode predicted transcripts of unknown function. these genes also comprise genes associated with developmental processes and, intriguingly, four genes encoding chemoreceptors .figure  <dig> 
size distributions of small rnas in young  and aged  virgin and mated flies. black and open arrowheads indicate the regions corresponding to mirnas and rasirnas, respectively. the arrows point at small fragments apparent only in young flies after mating that likely reflect mrna degradation products generated during the maternal to zygotic transition.



we detected  <dig> mature mirnas from  <dig> precursors, of which  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> precursors with  <dig> conserved seeds showed significant differences across the four conditions . similar numbers of mirnas show plastic responses to the four treatments. we find  <dig> differentially regulated mirnas after mating in young flies and  <dig> in old flies; and  <dig> mirnas differentially regulated with aging in virgin flies and  <dig> in mated flies, with considerable overlap in plastic responses of mirnas among the four physiological conditions . of particular interest is the mirna  <dig> cluster, which, in addition to mir- <dig>  comprises mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  the latter gives rise to three alternative stem-loop configurations with similar conserved seed regions  <cit> . zygotic expression of these mirnas has been associated with degradation of maternal mrna in embryos  <cit> . indeed, these mirnas are only expressed in mated flies and are virtually absent in virgins . among the  <dig> genes that are uniquely implicated in maternal degradation,  <dig> contain  <dig> conserved binding sites for mirnas that are differentially expressed after mating, and  <dig> genes are targets of the mirna  <dig> cluster.figure  <dig>

epigenetic plasticity
epigenetic regulation in d. melanogaster occurs primarily through association of modified histones with target dna sequences  <cit> . numerous post-translational modifications of histone proteins have been identified, including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, biotinylation and adp-ribosylation  <cit> . some histone modifications act in cis to change chromatin structure directly, whereas others act in trans to affect the recruitment of a protein complex that regulates gene expression  <cit> . modified histone protein residues can serve as docking sites for transcription factors and other chromatin-modifying enzymes to regulate transcription or induce further chromatin remodeling  <cit> . we examined three common histone  <dig> modifications  previously implicated in gene activation  <cit> .

we used immuno-coprecipitation to identify dna segments differentially associated with each of the histone  <dig> modifications across the genome. we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  peaks of co-precipitated dna fragments for h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac, respectively; of which  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   co-precipitated fragments were differentially expressed among the four physiological conditions . we found similar numbers of up- and down-regulated genes for each variable histone modification . the number of histone modifications associated with aging was larger than those associated with post-mating changes, especially for h3k4me <dig> . we identified candidate histone regulated genes associated with co-precipitated fragments by applying a 2 kb window downstream and upstream of each gene. on average,  <dig>  candidate genes were associated with each histone peak , of which ~24% are novel transcripts.table  <dig>

*differences between conditions were estimated by subtracting histone peak amplitudes in virgin flies from those in mated flies and in young flies from those in aged flies. only histone modification peaks that are significantly variable across the four conditions  with differences that are larger than one pooled standard deviation are counted.



about 10% of differentially modified fragments after mating in young flies were shared between h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  and between h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac, while about 15% were shared among h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac, and only about 1% of these fragments were associated with all three modified histone marks . similarly, about 17% of differentially modified fragments identified as a function of aging of virgin females were shared between h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  and between h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac, while as much as 36% of precipitated dna sequences were shared among h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac, and about 5% of sequences were associated with all three modified histone marks .

we asked to what extent histone modifications induced by mating are permanent throughout the lifespan of reproductively active females. we found that 18%, 9% and 11% of h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac modifications, respectively, that occurred post-mating in young flies persisted at 4 weeks of age when females were maintained in the presence of males. next, we asked how many of these histone modifications also occur as a result of aging in the absence of mating. we found that 65%, 73% and 77% of these h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac modifications, respectively, ultimately occur in virgin flies, but only at later age. these markers, therefore, represent epigenetic mating-induced accelerated aging changes and are associated with up to  <dig> unique candidate genes, of which  <dig> are annotated . these include genes associated with oocyte differentiation, including stonewall, 14-3-3zeta, bazooka, missing oocyte, and egalitarian. histone modifications that affect these candidate genes may reflect persistent post-mating stimulation of oogenesis.

to assess to what extent environmentally plastic transcripts might be causally associated with epigenetic regulation we asked which putative histone regulated genes showed altered transcriptional regulation across the four experimental conditions . the majority of genes with altered transcriptional regulation corresponded with candidate target genes for the three histone marks when young virgin flies are compared to young mated flies and when young mated flies are compared to aged mated flies . many fewer genes with altered transcriptional regulation corresponded with candidate target genes when young virgin flies were compared to aged virgins and when old virgin flies were compared to old mated flies . although these proportions roughly parallel differences in the numbers of transcripts with altered abundance levels as a consequence of mating or aging, they illustrate that different transcripts interact with histone  <dig> upon mating and as a function of age. among genes with altered transcriptional regulation that interact with modified histone  <dig>  only a few are associated with more than one histone mark, indicating target specific interactions for each histone modification with these genes .table  <dig>

*numbers in the table represent genes associated with histone marks. up-regulated and down-regulated refer to the histone marks detected by immuno co-precipitation. differences between conditions were estimated by subtracting histone peak amplitudes in virgin flies from those in mated flies and in young flies from those in aged flies.



phenotypically plastic regulatory networks
we identified target genes that undergo changes in expression for all mirnas with altered transcriptional regulation, and recruited genes known to interact with these target genes from the drosophila interactions database  <cit>  to obtain integrative networks that provide a comprehensive visualization of post-mating or aging-associated changes in whole genome transcriptional profiles, and superimposed histone marks on the networks. we only included genes with more than one interaction with mirna target genes. since very few transcripts were altered in the comparison of old virgin and mated flies, we derived these plastic regulatory networks for three conditions: young virgin and mated flies, young and old mated flies, and young and old virgin flies.

the network associated with post-mating changes in young flies comprised  <dig> target genes for  <dig> mirnas, and these target genes have  <dig> interacting partners . in addition to genes that encode predicted transcripts of unknown function, developmental genes feature prominently among the latter. the network reveals several notable features. first, there are shared targets for multiple mirnas. second, these target genes interact with multiple partners and each interacting partner interacts with multiple mirna targets, thus forming a collage of interacting ensembles that are embedded in the network. third, 13% of mirna target genes and 37% of their interacting partners are targets for regulation through histone modifications. in addition, two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  are themselves potential targets for h3k4me <dig>  it is reasonable to infer from the network structure that regulatory modifications at a limited number of focal genes can affect the expression of a suite of interacting partners.figure  <dig>

a similar analysis of transcriptional changes between young and old virgin flies gives rise to a smaller network, comprised of only seven mirnas, five target genes, and  <dig> genes interacting with these targets . of the latter,  <dig> are potential targets for regulation by modified histone  <dig>  as are two of the mirna target genes. among the seven mirnas, five overlap with the network associated with post-mating changes, including mir- <dig>  it should be noted that in this case the composition of differentially expressed mirna target genes restricts connectivity, which limits the size of the network. nevertheless, it is clear that the genetic architectures that underlie changes in gene expression are distinct with regard to post-mating changes and aging, as might be expected.figure  <dig>

effects of micro-rna overexpression on target gene expression
to test the connectivity of the computational networks  and evaluate causality, we overexpressed six mirnas for which overexpression lines were available  using the binary gal4-uas expression system  <cit>  under a universal ubiquitin promoter. evidence that the driver was effective comes from the observation that no viable offspring could be obtained when mir-281- <dig> and mir- <dig> were overexpressed. the remaining overexpression lines generated f <dig> progeny, in which we used quantitative rt-pcr to monitor expression of target genes in virgin and mated flies contemporaneously with f <dig> progeny obtained by crossing the control progenitor strain to the ubiquitin-gal <dig> driver line. we assessed whether changes in their corresponding target genes that were differentially expressed between young virgin and mated females were significantly different after mating in control lines compared to the mirna overexpression lines . despite differences in genetic backgrounds between the gal4-uas offspring and the original canton s  line used to derive the networks, we observed significant effects for  <dig> of the  <dig> target genes tested . thus, perturbation of mirnas results in disruption of target gene expression that occurs during changes in physiological state and directly implicates mirnas in the regulation of post-mating and aging-dependent gene expression.table  <dig>

*student’s t-tests were used to calculate p-values of significant differences between expression in virgin and mated flies. overexpression of a mirna has an effect on the target gene when differential expression of the target gene is only significant  in control females, but not in the mirna overexpressing females, or vice versa.



effects of micro-rna overexpression on egg laying
stimulation of oogenesis and oviposition is the most profound change induced in females as a consequence of mating  <cit> . to assess causality between post-mating modulation of mirna expression and oviposition, we measured egg laying after mating by control females and females overexpressing mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-92b, or mir- <dig>  mating causes a reduction in expression of mir- <dig>  mir-92b and mir- <dig> and an increase in expression of mir- <dig> . females that overexpress mir- <dig> and mir-92b lay 34% and 37% fewer eggs after mating, whereas females that overexpress mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> lay 16% and 33% more eggs than controls . thus, post-mating changes in mirna expression levels are causally associated with physiological changes.figure  <dig>

discussion
we identified genomic and epigenomic changes in gene expression that are associated with mating and aging in female d. melanogaster. we found that  <dig> mirnas change expression levels after mating, including transient expression of members of the mir- <dig> cluster associated with the maternal to zygotic transition that results in maternal mrna breakdown  <cit> . the mir- <dig> cluster is analogous to mir- <dig>  which mediates the maternal to zygotic transition in zebrafish  <cit> . up-regulation of the mir- <dig> cluster after mating is accompanied by the transient accumulation of small rna fragments, likely representing breakdown products of degraded maternal rnas in embryos. in d. melanogaster, loci required for the destabilization of distinct subsets of maternal mrnas during the maternal to zygotic transition have been mapped to different chromosome arms  <cit> , indicating that different mechanisms may mediate maternal rna degeneration in the zygote. the appearance of rna fragments only in young flies after mating could be due to subsequent changes that may include epigenetic modifications, which increase the efficiency of the removal of such fragments during repeated matings.

we identified target genes for mirnas that change transcript abundance levels after mating. we examined similar changes in genome-wide expression levels of mirnas and their associated target genes that occur as females age. in addition, we analyzed epigenetic modifications mediated via histone  <dig> that are associated with mating and aging. we were able to construct integrative genetic networks from a subset of genes with altered expression due to mating or aging to visualize part of the genetic architectures that underlie these physiological changes. we found that the largest differences in transcript profiles occur in young females after mating. although the genetic architectures that underlie changes in gene expression are distinct with regard to post-mating changes and aging, we found epigenetic modifications that occur post-mating in young flies and at later age in virgin flies, consistent with mating-induced accelerated aging and consequent shortening of the lifespan of mated females  <cit>  .

the power of our analysis is limited by the small number of replicate samples and histone modifications analyzed, and possible differences in genomic responses in different genetic backgrounds. thus, the complement of genes that undergo altered regulation as a consequence of physiological state and epigenetic modifications that could regulate their expression provides only a partial view of the genetic architectures that regulate physiological state-induced regulation of gene expression. furthermore, genes associated with histone marks are commonly assigned based on chromosomal location  <cit> . demonstrating causal relationships with candidate genes within such chromosomal regions remains challenging, and it is difficult to unambiguously identify false positives or exclude long-distance effects of modified histones on gene expression. we alleviated this concern to some extent by focusing on histone modifications associated with co-localized genes that undergo altered expression. we also note that our analyses were performed on whole flies and we cannot exclude that some changes in mirna expression or histone modifications may be compartmentalized to certain tissues.

a large proportion of genes with changes in transcript abundance are members of gene families. members of the jonah, cp, twdl, and mal gene families show antagonistic changes in transcript abundances after mating and as a result of aging, whereas vm family members show changes in the same direction. similarly, some genes with altered expression that belong to gene ontology categories shared between mating and aging conditions also show antagonistic effects. we speculate that these antagonistic changes may be part of the molecular machinery that mediates trade-offs between reproduction and lifespan  <cit> . in addition to restricted expression in a limited number of cells, antagonistic regulation in different tissues could also be a limiting factor in detecting genes that undergo altered transcriptional regulation .we observed many histone modifications after mating or upon aging that are not accompanied by changes in corresponding transcript abundances. here, the target gene might be remote from the histone-dna interaction site. alternatively, interaction between the histone and the target gene might prevent activation of this gene at a later stage or inactivation of a gene that is actively expressed. furthermore, the networks centered on mirnas and their target genes  do not include all transcripts with altered expression levels, nor do they include all potential target genes for epigenetic regulation. nevertheless, the complex structure of these networks raises the possibility that epigenetic regulation of target genes for histone  <dig> could also indirectly affect the expression of interconnected genes.

in addition to epigenetic modifications that uniquely occur after mating, we identified identical epigenetic markers that occur also in virgin females at advanced age. these mark post-mating changes that relate to the shortening of female lifespan after mating, possibly due to the increased energy expenditure required for egg production  <cit> .

overexpression of mirnas confirmed the biological relevance of the derived environmentally plastic regulatory networks. despite differences in genetic backgrounds, altered expression of mirnas correlated with altered expression of ~70% of their candidate target genes, and in all cases mirna overexpression affected post-mating oviposition. although we analyzed only a subset of mirnas for which viable overexpression lines could be obtained, it is reasonable to assume that these observations would extend to the larger ensemble of mirnas.

since this study focused on whole flies, it remains to be determined to what extent the genomic and epigenomic changes we have observed are compartmentalized to reproductive organs or the central nervous system. previous studies have implicated steroid hormones in regulating expression of mirnas  <cit> . odorant binding proteins expressed in the male accessory gland could conceivably serve as carriers for such ligands  <cit> . however, the precise mechanisms by which signals transmitted during mating regulate gene expression remain to be explored. nevertheless, this study presents to the best of our knowledge the first demonstration that mirnas play a critical role in mediating post-mating changes in female flies and a comprehensive documentation of the genomic and epigenomic changes that accompany mating-induced physiological changes as well as aging in female d. melanogaster.

CONCLUSIONS
to gain insight regarding the genes and regulatory networks underpinning plastic changes after mating and during aging, we identified mrnas, micrornas and epigenetic modifications with significantly different expression after mating or as a function of aging. we used these data to derive phenotypically plastic regulatory networks centered on environmentally sensitive micrornas associated with aging and mating, and identified several biomarkers of mating-induced accelerated aging. overexpression of several plastic micrornas resulted in altered expression of candidate target genes and affected oviposition. micrornas are thus critical in mediating post-mating changes in gene expression. these data provide comprehensive documentation of the genomic and epigenomic changes that accompany mating- and aging-induced physiological changes in female d. melanogaster.
