BACKGROUND
the global pandemic caused by the novel apdm <dig> was first declared in mexico and the united states in april  <dig>  inducing severe morbidity and mortality in a subset of the population  <cit> . this novel strain of influenza a virus is made up of a unique combination of gene segments from eurasian swine, human and avian influenza viruses  <cit> . thus, seasonal influenza vaccines do not confer effective cross-protection against apdm <dig> virus infection. while the virulence and evolution of influenza virus have been intensively studied, the impact of host genetic background on the susceptibility to pandemic influenza virus infection remains largely unknown.

it has been suggested that the host genetic factors may affect the susceptibility and progression of microbial infections  <cit> . for example, chinese population-attributable risk for severe influenza infection was ten-fold greater than northern european population-attributable risk because of the high frequency of rs12252-c in han chinese  <cit> . meanwhile, the snps in tlr <dig>  <cit> , cd <dig>  <cit> , c1q and fcgr2a  <cit> , tnf  <cit> , lta, il <dig> and il1b  <cit>  were suggested to be connected with the severity of apdm <dig> virus infection.

during influenza virus infection, il-1b has been demonstrated to mediate acute pulmonary inflammatory pathology  <cit> . pro-il-1b was cleaved by caspase- <dig> which was activated through the formation of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome  <cit> . recent studies have shown that il-1a secretion was also regulated by the nlrp <dig> inflammasome  <cit> . in addition, il-1a and il-1b induced the expression of a variety of inflammatory mediators, which may initiate the cascade of inflammatory responses and induced the activation of t cells  <cit> . to date, few studies have explored the association between il- <dig> polymorphisms and a/h1n <dig> susceptibility  <cit> . therefore, investigation of whether the genetic variants in il- <dig> impact the susceptibility to apdm <dig> is of great importance.

in this study, we examined  <dig> snps in il <dig> gene and evaluated their association with apdm <dig> susceptibility. the results indicated that rs <dig> polymorphism in il1a gene and rs <dig> polymorphism in il1b gene, two novel snps of il- <dig> gene, contributed to the susceptibility to apdm <dig> 

methods
study subjects and samples
 <dig> patients with apdm <dig> were recruited in shenzhen third people’s hospital, china during  <dig> influenza pandemic period.  <dig> patients  were included in this study, and the average age of patients is  <dig>  . the diagnosis of apdm <dig> was followed the guideline released by the ministry of health of the people’s republic of china.  <dig> healthy donors  were from shenzhen, china during the same period, and no occurrence of apdm <dig> was found in the hd during 1 year’s follow-up.  <dig> health individuals  were recruited as controls, and the average age of healthy individuals is  <dig>  . all subjects were chinese han people whom have received flu vaccine previously. venous blood was drawn from all subjects after an overnight fasting. blood corpuscles were stored at −80°c for dna purification. the study was approved by the institutional review board of shenzhen third people’s hospital, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. there is no significant difference for the average age and gender distribution between cases and controls .

dna extraction and snp selection
genomic dna was obtained from peripheral blood samples, using the qiaamp dna blood mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instruction. isolated dna was stored at −80°c before usage. snps were selected according to methods described previously  <cit> , with focusing on their potential regulatory roles, such as transcription binding sites in the promoter region, microrna target sites in the 3′ untranslated region , protein phosphorylation sites in the extrons and other putative regulation sites.

to search for the snps with alleles that alter the putative transcription factor binding sites, we scanned the promoter region of the gene in transfac database  <cit> . for the annotated snps in dbsnp <dig> that are within 2000 bp upstream to 500 bp downstream of the il- <dig> gene, we extracted their flanking sequence  from the dbsnp website . we then used a pwm_scan algorithm  <cit>  to scan each sequence in the set to test whether it had a putative binding site , using the method described previously  <cit> . to search for the snps with alleles that alter the putative microrna target sites, we first searched the pita database for the micrornas that could target the 3′ utr region of the il- <dig> gene. for the snp that is in the target site, we obtained its flanking sequence  from the ucsc genome browser according to its genomic location. we then tested whether the change of alleles also changed the microrna target interaction by rna hybridization. in addition, we used tagging procedure to select snps that cover the il- <dig> gene  <cit> , and chose the chb + jpt hapmap panel, r2 =  <dig>  and default settings for all other parameters. we also selected several other snps in the il- <dig> gene region that were reported to be associated with disease severity  <cit> . the allelic variant substitution bases and the allele specific primer sequences were shown in table  <dig> 

genotyping
snps’ genotyping was based on analysis of primer extension products generated from previously amplified genomic dna using a chip-based maldi-tof mass spectrometry platform . the amplification pcr primer pairs and the extend primers were designed by massarray assay designer software v <dig> , in combination with manual adjustment . pcr amplification was performed in the hotstar buffer system . extend products were dispensed onto a 384-spot plate, and thermo cycling  was initiated at 94°c for 5 min; followed by 40 cycles of 94°c for 30 s, 55°c for 30 s, 72°c for 30 s; and a final extension of 72°c for 3 min to amplify identical length products. following genomic amplification of the target regions, excess deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates were dephosphorylated with 2 μl shrimp alkaline phosphatase by incubation at 37°c for 60 min, and stopped by inactivation at 85°c for 10 min.

the selected snps were analyzed in one primer-extension reaction, the pcr was then performed at 94°c for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94°c for 5 s, , followed by a final extension done at 72°c for 3 min. after desalting extension products for maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis by the addition of 16 μl water and 6 mg of clean resin to each sample. data analysis was performed by using massarray typer software  <dig> .

statistical analysis
the frequencies of allele and genotype were determined by direct counting. all snps investigated in this study were tested for hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the pearson χ <dig> test was used to compare allele and genotype distribution in cases and controls. odds ratios  and their 95% confidence intervals  were calculated with miettinen’s method. each snp was calculated under four alternative models , as previously described  <cit> . bonferroni correction was used to compare the allelic frequency between participants with different genotypes. all the statistical procedures were performed with spss <dig>  software. p < <dig>  was considered to be significant.

RESULTS
selection and genotyping of il1a/il1b snps
to choose relevant snps for il1a and il1b gene, we considered about  <dig> known and rare variants, which are publicly available in database . after bioinformatic analysis and prediction for snps that may influence gene expression or protein structure and function, a total of  <dig> snps, including  <dig> in the il1a gene , and  <dig> in the il1b gene , were selected finally. the locations of these snps in il- <dig> were shown in figure  <dig>  rs <dig> is in the intron  <dig> and 209 bp after the extron  <dig>  of il1a gene. rs <dig> is in the extron  <dig> of il1a gene and 340 bp after coding sequence  start site. rs <dig> is in the 3′utr of il1a gene and 408 bp after cds terminal site. rs <dig> is in the 3′utr of il1a gene, 922 bp after cds terminal site and a 4 bp fraction is missing.  <dig> snps of il1b gene are all in the promoter region. rs <dig> is 1473 bp before the transcription start site of il1b gene. rs <dig> is 798 bp before the transcription start site of il1b gene and a 4 bp fraction is missing. rs <dig> is 31 bp before the transcription start site of il1b gene. genotypes of these  <dig> snps were determined using the maldi-tof mass spectrometry platform in a cohort of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. the intensities of mass signal of rs <dig> and rs <dig> snps from three dna samples analyzed by maldi-tof mass spectrum were shown in figure  <dig> 

association of il1a gene snps with a/h1n <dig> susceptibility
the genotypic frequencies of the two groups in these  <dig> snps were shown in table  <dig>  the distribution of genotype in patients with ph1n1/ <dig> and healthy controls were coincident with hardy-weinberg equilibrium . the t allele of rs <dig> showed a two-fold increase in risk for influenza compared with the g allele . under the dominant model, heterozygotes and homozygotes for the t allele had a two-fold increase of risk for influenza compared with homozygotes for the g allele . however, no significant differences in allelic frequencies for other snps were found between cases and controls. thus, these data suggested that the rs <dig> snp, located on the extron of il1a leading to ser114ala mutation, was associated with apdm <dig> susceptibility.

ci, confidence interval; or, odds ratio. the p values < <dig>  were highlighted in boldface.

association of il1b gene snps with a/h1n <dig> susceptibility
 <dig> snps in il1b were successfully genotyped and considered for genetic association tests , and all these snps were consist with hardy-weinberg equilibrium . the rs <dig> snp located on  <dig> base pairs upstream from the transcription start site of il1b gene was evaluated for the association with increased risk of influenza susceptibility. under the multiplicative model, the t allele showed an increase in risk for influenza compared with the c allele . under the additive model, genotype tt had a two-fold higher risk for influenza compared with genotype cc . under the dominant model, heterozygotes and homozygotes for the t allele had a two-fold higher risk for influenza compared with homozygotes for the c allele . other  <dig> snps in il1b showed no significant differences in allelic frequency among cases and controls. thus, rs <dig> snp in il1b gene showed significant association with increased susceptibility to influenza.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed the genetic factors impacting the susceptibility to apdm <dig>  we examined  <dig> snps in il1a and il1b genes and evaluated the association between snps of il- <dig> and apdm <dig> susceptibility. we found that rs <dig> polymorphism in il1a gene and rs <dig> polymorphism in il1b gene contributed to the susceptibility to apdm <dig> 

in humans, il- <dig> exists in two forms, il-1a  and il-1b , and both forms of il- <dig> locate on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . il-1a and il-1b are inflammatory cytokines that play important roles in recruitment of the immune and inflammatory cells and development of adaptive immune responses  <cit> . accumulating evidence has suggested that il-1a and il-1b play important roles in innate immunity against viral infection. infection of viruses such as, hepatitis a virus   <cit> , epstein-barr virus   <cit> , hiv  <cit>  and human papilloma viruses   <cit> , may activate the extracellular signal and induce production of il- <dig>  several studies have documented an early rise in il- <dig> in bronchoalveolar lavage  fluids or lung homogenates in temporal association with symptom formation and lung pathology after infection with a/pr/8/ <dig> h1n <dig> or apdm <dig>  <cit> .

in fact, il1a with rs <dig> allele t has been suggested to be associated with immunopathogenesis of several diseases, including nasal polyposis  <cit> , chronic rhinosinusitis  <cit> . rs <dig> polymorphism was related with high levels of c-reactive protein, which can regulate the severity inflammatory response  <cit> . interestingly, our result also indicated that rs <dig> allele t increased the risk of apdm <dig> susceptibility. in contrast, rs <dig> and rs <dig> locating on 3′utr, and rs <dig> locating on intron box did not display any association with the susceptibility to apdm <dig>  the snp rs <dig> represents a nonsynonymous mutation  in il-1a protein, suggesting that this mutation may lead to a potential functional variation in host susceptibility to apdm <dig>  however, the exact mechanism needs to be further studied.

during influenza virus infection, the immune response was triggered by the influenza virus ion channel m <dig> which was essential for virus entry and replication, leading to the assembly of inflammasome in macrophages and dendritic cells   <cit> . then, the activation of inflammasome resulted in the cleavage of pro-il-1b by caspase- <dig> and produced the mature form of il-1b  <cit> . il-1b may act with il- <dig> to induce ifn-γ production by t cells  <cit>  and promote rorγt expression and th- <dig> polarization of cd <dig> t cells  <cit> . the th- <dig> effector cells produced il- <dig> and facilitated the recruitment of neutrophils and inflammation  <cit> .

here, we found a significantly high frequency of il-1b rs <dig> allele c in a/h1n <dig> patients, suggesting the hosts with allele c were more susceptible to this virus infection. importantly,the frequency of the rs <dig> allele c is quite rich in han chinese . thus, elucidation of the underlying mechanism of the polymorphism of rs <dig> is of great importance for in-depth understanding of the susceptibility of influenza in chinese population. rs <dig> polymorphism involved the variation of il-1b − <dig> allele c to t and is located on the tata box of il1b gene promoter region, which has been demonstrated to be a critical motif partially determining il-1b transcriptional efficiency  <cit> . furthermore, the rs <dig> and its franking sequences can be bound by transcription factors, including c/ebpβ, tbp and spi- <dig>  <cit> . electrophoretic mobility shift assay  analysis suggested that c/ebpβ confers a much higher affinity to rs1143627-c probe than to t probe  <cit> . several reports have shown that the allele t of rs <dig> enhanced il-1b protein expression  <cit> , and t-allele of rs <dig> was considered to be a pro-inflammatory allele  <cit> . people who carry allele t had a higher il-1b expression that may promote the production of ifn-γ, which plays an important role in virus clearance  <cit> . il-1b may also facilitate the differentiation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory cells such as th- <dig> in humans  <cit> . in contrast, the expression of il-1b may be much lower in people who carry allele c, leading to weaker immune response during viral infection.

thus, it is possible that il1b snp rs <dig> c allele has a lower binding affinity to c/ebpβ and reduced levels of il-1b expression, which may therefore weaken the inflammatory response of th- <dig> and th- <dig> cells in humans during influenza infection. a cohort of study with a larger population size is needed to further confirm the association of il1a rs <dig> allele t and il1b rs <dig> allele c with an increased risk for the susceptibility to apdm <dig>  functional studies will also be needed to further investigate the role and mechanism of genetic variants of il- <dig> on the impact of susceptibility to apdm <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
il1a rs <dig> allele t and il1b rs <dig> allele c may confer an increased risk for the susceptibility to apdm <dig>  thus, this study provides a new insight into the immunopathogenesis of influenza a virus infection in humans.
