BACKGROUND
glycosylation is one of the most complex and ubiquitous post-translational modifications  of proteins in eukaryotic cells. it is a dynamic enzymatic process in which saccharides are attached to proteins or lipoproteins, usually on serine , threonine , asparagine , and tryptophan  residues. glycosylation, like phosphorylation, is clinically important because of its role in a wide variety of cellular, developmental and immunological processes, including protein folding, protein trafficking and localization, cell-cell interactions, and epitope recognition  <cit> .

glycosylation can be classified into four types based on the nature of chemical linkage between specific acceptor residues in the protein and sugar: n-linked and o-linked glycosylation, c-mannosylation, and gpi  anchors. the acceptor residues represent the glycosylation sites.

in n-linked glycosylation, the oligosaccharide chain  is attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine , which is part of characteristic sequence motifs n-x-t , n-x-s  or n-x-c , where x can be any residue except proline  <cit> . these sequence motifs are necessary, but not sufficient for an asp residue to serve as an acceptor site for glycan attachment. a variety of different glycans  can be attached to asp.

in o-linked glycosylation, the glycan is attached to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine  or threonine . no specific sequence motifs have been defined for o-linked glycosylation. however, it has been reported that most o-linked glycosylation occurs on ser or thr residues in close proximity to a proline residue  <cit> . examples of the o-glycans include: o-n-acetylgalactosamine  , o-n-acetylglucosamine , o-fucose, o-glucose, o-mannose, o-hexose, o-xylose. it is important to note that o-glcnac glycans are often added to ser/thr residues that would otherwise be phosphorylated, one illustration of the complex interplay among eukaryotic post-translational modification systems.

in c-mannosylation, the glycan is attached to the carbon of a tryptophan  residue rather than to the amide nitrogen of asp, or hydroxyl oxygen of ser or thr, making it an unusual modification. the attachment occurs within the sequence motifs w-x-x-w on the first trp , w-x-x-c or w-x-x-f  <cit> . we will refer to this type of glycosylation as c-linked glycosylation.

in gpi anchors , a hydrophobic phosphatidylinositol group is linked to a residue at or near the c-terminus of a protein through a carbohydrate-containing linker. gpi anchor addition is both structurally and functionally related to another important post-translational modification, prenylation, in which hydrophobic farnesyl or geranyl-geranyl moieties are added to c-terminal cysteine  residues of target proteins. gpi anchors target and "anchor" proteins to the cell membrane  <cit> .

experimental determination of glycosylation sites in proteins is an expensive and laborious process  <cit> . hence, there is significant interest in computational approaches to reliably predicting the glycosylation sites from an amino acid sequence. machine learning methods currently offer one of the most cost-effective approaches to construction of predictive models in applications where representative training data are available. fortunately, o-glycbase  <cit>  provides such a dataset for training classifiers for predicting glycosylation sites.

from a machine learning point of view, the problem of glycosylation site prediction can be formulated as a binary classification problem: given a protein sequence s of length n, s = s <dig> s <dig> ⋯ sn over the alphabet Σ of amino acids, |Σ| =  <dig>  si ∈ Σ, i =  <dig>  ⋯, n and s ∈ Σ*, the task is to predict whether or not a site is a glycosylation site. machine learning algorithms can then be used to train such classifiers. we train support vector machines and ensembles of support vector machine classifiers  <cit>  to predict glycosylation versus non-glycosylation sites for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation types. o-glycbase dataset does not contain information about gpi anchors.

several approaches to predicting glycosylation sites have been reported in the literature. blom et al.  <cit>  provide a review of available prediction methods, databases and servers for glycosylation. elhammer et al.  <cit>  use information derived from the frequency of amino acids in the neighborhood of a glycosylation site to identify putative glycosylation sites. this method uses only information derived from the sequence neighbors of glycosylated sites, while ignoring the information available from non-glycosylated sites, which might be useful in extracting sequence features that help distinguish glycosylation sites from non-glycosylation sites. hansen et al.  <cit>  use artificial neural networks trained on information derived from both glycosylation and non-glycosylation sites. their server, netoglyc, makes predictions for mucin type o-linked glycosylation on mammalian proteins. li et al.  <cit>  train support vector machine classifiers based on physicochemical properties of amino acids and a 0/ <dig> system to classify mucin type o-linked glycosylation on mammalian proteins.

although work on predicting glycosylation sites exists in the literature, there is significant room for improvement of current approaches.

one particular challenge in training classifiers using standard machine learning algorithms comes from the fact that the available dataset is highly unbalanced  <cit> : the fraction of glycosylation sites is relatively small compared to the fraction of non-glycosylation sites. classifiers that are trained to optimize accuracy generally perform rather poorly on the minority class. hence, if accurate classification of sites from the minority class is important , a common approach is to change the distribution of glycosylation and non-glycosylation sites during training by randomly selecting a subset of the training data for the majority class. however, this makes it difficult to reliably identify the majority of the glycosylation sites without falsely predicting non-glycosylation sites as glycosylation sites. in addition, this approach fails to utilize all of the information available in the training data extracted from the original sequence dataset.

against this background, we explore an ensemble of support vector machine classifiers  <cit> , trained on the "natural" distribution of the data extracted from the original sequence data, for predicting glycosylation sites and we compare it with single support vector machine classifiers.

RESULTS
the main result of our study is that the ensembles of support vector machine classifiers described here outperform single support vector machine classifiers on the problem of predicting glycosylation sites.

an ensemble of support vector machines outperforms a single support vector machine trained on unbalanced data on the glycosylation site prediction task
for each glycosylation type considered in this study, n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation, we trained ensembles of support vector machine  classifiers to predict whether or not a site in a protein sequence is a glycosylation site. an ensemble of svms  <cit>  is simply a collection of svm classifiers, each trained on a balanced subsample of the training data. the prediction of the ensemble of svms is computed from the predictions of the individual svm classifiers .

we compared the performance of the ensemble of svm classifiers with that of a single svm classifier trained on the original distribution of the glycosylation data . note that the ensemble of svms is trained on the original distribution of the glycosylation data. with any classifier, it is possible to tradeoff the rate of true positive predictions  against the rate of false positive predictions. hence, it is much more informative to compare the receiver operating characteristic  curves which show the tradeoff between true positive and false positive predictions over their entire range of possible values than to compare the performance of the classifiers for a particular choice of the tradeoff   <cit> .

thus, we compared the roc curves for both ensemble of svms and single svm trained on unbalanced data using local sequence information  with 0/ <dig> string kernel, for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks. the roc curves of ensembles of svm classifiers for n-linked, o-linked, and c-linked glycosylation sites dominate the roc curves for their single svm counterparts . that is, for any choice of false positive rate, the ensemble of svms offers a higher true positive rate than the single svm for the same task.

for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks, the area under the roc curve   <cit>  is larger for the ensemble of svms than for the corresponding single svm .

the estimated numbers of true positives , false negatives , false positives , and true negatives  depend on how the classification threshold θ on the roc curve is selected . the information obtained from these numbers can be summarized by several commonly used performance measures  that seek to evaluate the quality of the predictions  <cit> .

in the case of classifiers trained to predict n-linked glycosylation sites which occur in relatively "conserved" motifs, at a false positive rate of  <dig> , the corresponding true positive rate of the single svm is  <dig>  whereas that of the ensemble of svms is  <dig> , i.e., 5% greater sensitivity . for a specific point θ =  <dig>  on the roc curves, the estimated numbers tp, fn, fp, and tn of the single svm are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> respectively, whereas those of the ensemble of svms are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  hence, the single svm achieves  <dig>  accuracy,  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient,  <dig>  sensitivity,  <dig>  specificity,  <dig>  f-measure, and  <dig>  auc, and the ensemble of svms achieves  <dig>  accuracy,  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient,  <dig>  sensitivity,  <dig>  specificity,  <dig>  f-measure, and  <dig>  auc .

results obtained for n-linked glycosylation using single svm from unbalanced data , ensemble of svms , and single svm from balanced data  for the classification threshold θ =  <dig>  on the output probability of the classifier. the classifiers are trained on information derived from the target amino acid residue and its sequence neighbors.

in the case of classifiers trained to predict o-linked glycosylation sites for which no obvious local sequence motifs exist, at a false positive rate of  <dig> , the ensemble of svms has 6% greater sensitivity than the single svm  . for θ =  <dig> , the estimated numbers tp, fn, fp, and tn of the single svm are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> respectively, whereas those of the ensemble of svms are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  thus, the single svm achieves  <dig>  accuracy,  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient,  <dig>  sensitivity,  <dig>  specificity,  <dig>  f-measure, and  <dig>  auc, and the ensemble of svms achieves  <dig>  accuracy,  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient,  <dig>  sensitivity,  <dig>  specificity,  <dig>  f-measure, and  <dig>  auc .

results obtained for o-linked glycosylation using single svm from unbalanced data , ensemble of svms , and single svm from balanced data  for the classification threshold θ =  <dig>  on the output probability of the classifier. the classifiers are trained on information derived from the target amino acid residue and its sequence neighbors.

in the case of classifiers trained to predict c-linked glycosylation sites  at a false positive rate of  <dig> , the ensemble of svms has 17% greater sensitivity than the single svm. for θ =  <dig> , the estimated numbers tp, fn, fp, and tn of the single svm are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> respectively, whereas those of the ensemble of svms are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the single svm achieves  <dig>  accuracy,  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient,  <dig>  sensitivity,  <dig>  specificity,  <dig>  f-measure, and  <dig>  auc, and the ensemble of svms achieves  <dig>  accuracy,  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient,  <dig>  sensitivity,  <dig>  specificity,  <dig>  f-measure, and  <dig>  auc .

results obtained for c-linked glycosylation using single svm from unbalanced data , ensemble of svms , and single svm from balanced data  for the classification threshold θ =  <dig>  on the output probability of the classifier. the classifiers are trained on information derived from the target amino acid residue and its sequence neighbors.

an ensemble of support vector machines outperforms a single support vector machine trained on balanced data on the glycosylation site prediction task
for each glycosylation type considered in this study, n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation, we also compared the performance of the ensemble of svm classifiers with that of a single svm classifier trained on a balanced training set  and evaluated on a test set . note that it is important to evaluate the classifier on a dataset that reflects the distribution of glycosylation and non-glycosylation sites in the original dataset and not a dataset with an altered distribution.

we compared the roc curves for both ensemble of svms and single svm trained on balanced data using local sequence information  with 0/ <dig> string kernel, for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks . the roc curves of ensembles of svm classifiers for n-linked, o-linked, and c-linked glycosylation sites dominate the roc curves for their single svm counterparts for reasonably high values of sensitivity .

for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks, the auc of the ensemble of svms is larger than that of the corresponding single svm .

the results of this experiment show that simply balancing the training data used to train a single svm classifier does not yield a classifier that performs as well as an ensemble of svm classifiers. for example, in the case of single svm trained on balanced data to predict o-linked glycosylation sites, the measured tp, fn, fp, and tn for the threshold θ =  <dig>  are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. thus, a single svm trained on balanced data correctly identifies a larger fraction of glycosylation sites than the ensemble of svms, but does so at the cost of falsely predicting a greater fraction of non-glycosylation sites as glycosylation sites .

discussion
performance of ensembles of support vector machines on the task of predicting glycosylation sites
in this study, we explored ensembles of svm classifiers trained on the "natural" distribution of the data extracted from the original glycoprotein sequence dataset to accurately discriminate between glycosylation and non-glycosylation sites in a protein sequence, for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks, using local sequence information  with 0/ <dig> string kernel.

an ensemble of svms is a collection of svm classifiers, each trained on a balanced subsample of the training data. the prediction of the ensemble is computed from the predictions of the individual svm classifiers. we performed sequence-based k-fold cross-validation  <cit>  to estimate the generalization accuracy of the predictive models .

we found that ensembles of svms outperform both single svm trained on unbalanced data and single svm trained on balanced data.

in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we compared the receiver operating characteristic  curves for ensemble of svms and single svm trained on unbalanced data for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks respectively. the single svm as well as the ensemble of svms are trained on the "natural" distribution of the data extracted from the original glycoprotein sequence dataset. as illustrated in the figures, the roc curves of the ensembles of svms dominate the roc curves of their single svm counterparts.

in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we compared the roc curves for ensemble of svms and single svm trained on balanced data for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks respectively. the single svm is trained on the "altered" distribution of the data obtained by randomly selecting a subset of non-glycosylation sites equal in size with the set of glycosylation sites, whereas the ensemble of svms is trained on the "natural" distribution of the glycosylation data. again, the roc curves of the ensembles of svms dominate the roc curves of their single svm counterparts for reasonably high values of sensitivity.

we also explored ensembles of svms using local sequence identity with substitution matrix string kernel  <cit>  for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation prediction tasks. we found that ensembles of svms using local sequence identity with substitution matrix string kernel do not yield improvement over ensembles of svms using local sequence identity with 0/ <dig> string kernel.

we compared the performance of svm  classifiers using evolutionary information with polynomial kernel  <cit> . the feature vector representation was computed based on multiple sequence alignment profiles produced by psi-blast, a tool that searches a large sequence database for sequence similarities  <cit> . the roc curves for ensemble of svms dominate the roc curves of single svm for n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation. interestingly, ensembles of svm classifiers trained using evolutionary information do not perform better than those trained using local sequence identity .

performance of ensembles of naive bayes classifiers on the task of predicting glycosylation sites
in addition to ensembles of svms and single svm classifiers, we trained ensembles of naive bayes and single naive bayes classifiers  <cit>  on the original distribution of the data to identify putative glycosylation sites in a glycoprotein sequence. naive bayes classifiers offer a computationally efficient approach to training classifiers that are easier to understand than svm or ensembles of svms for a variety of classification problems. we found that the performance of single naive bayes is similar to that of the ensemble of naive bayes classifiers as well as to that of the single svm trained on unbalanced data .

performance of ensembles of support vector machines on the task of predicting glycosylation sites for a user-specified classification threshold
the roc curves show the tradeoff between the rate of true positive predictions and the rate of false positive predictions for any user-specified classification threshold θ ∈  <cit> . hence, the estimated numbers of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives depend on how this classification threshold θ on the roc curve is chosen. the threshold θ can be chosen to optimize a given performance measure  on the training data . when θ was chosen to optimize the f-measure, the results obtained with it are moderately better than the results obtained with the default value of θ =  <dig> .

ensembles of support vector machine classifiers -an approach to dealing with the unbalanced and large glycoprotein dataset
the glycoprotein dataset is highly unbalanced, i.e., the number of negative instances  is much larger compared to the number of positive instances . unbalanced datasets present a challenge for support vector machine classifiers that are trained to optimize the generalization accuracy.  they generally perform rather poorly on the minority class. hence, if accurate classification of instances from the minority class is important, a common approach is to change the distribution of positive and negative instances during training by randomly selecting a subset of the training data for the majority class  <cit> . however, this makes it difficult to reliably identify the majority of the glycosylation sites without falsely predicting non-glycosylation sites as glycosylation sites. in addition, this approach fails to utilize all of the information available in the training data extracted from the original glycoprotein sequence dataset.

results presented here demonstrate that a better approach is to construct an ensemble of svm classifiers  <cit> , each classifier being trained on a balanced subsample of the training data. the svm classifiers in the ensemble are thus trained on different subsets of the training data. a sample instance is misclassified by the ensemble if a majority of the svm classifiers in the ensemble misclassify it. when the errors made by the individual classifiers are uncorrelated, the predictions of the ensemble of classifiers are often more reliable.

the glycoprotein dataset is also very large i.e., it contains a large number of instances . large datasets present a computational challenge for machine learning algorithms such as svm which solves a dual quadratic optimization problem to find the decision function. the use of an ensemble of svm classifiers, each trained on a small subset of the training data significantly reduces the overall training time of a single svm classifier trained on the entire training data. construction of ensembles of classifiers makes svm applicable to large datasets that would otherwise be considered "impractical" for training a single svm classifier.

comparison with previous work
in comparing the ensemble of svm classifiers with the previous work on the glycosylation prediction task, we focused on the svm approach presented in li et al.  <cit> . the authors in  <cit>  developed a system using svm classifiers in order to predict o-linked glycosylation sites. there are four key differences between their approach and ours: in the datasets used, in the selection of negative examples, in the evaluation procedures, and in the methods used. we describe the differences in more detail in what follows.

first, the glycoprotein dataset used in  <cit>  is extracted from swiss-prot/uniprot <dig>   <cit>  and contains only mammalian glycoprotein sequences that have "mucin-type" o-linked glycosylation annotations. we use a glycoprotein dataset extracted from o-glycbase v <dig>   <cit> , a resource containing experimentally verified glycosylation sites compiled from protein databases and literature. our dataset contains glycoprotein sequences from diverse eukaryotic organisms, , with three types of glycosylation annotations: n-linked, o-linked, and c-linked glycosylation annotations with a large variety of glycans .

a second difference between our approach and that of  <cit>  has to do with the selection of negative examples  in the dataset. the negative examples in the dataset of  <cit>  correspond to s/t sites sampled from mammalian protein sequences that lack annotation of glycosylation sites. in contrast, the negative examples in our dataset correspond to s/t sites for which no experimental evidence of glycosylation exists and are extracted from protein sequences that contain at least one experimentally verified glycosylation site. the underlying rationale for this choice is that the resulting negative examples are more likely to be non-glycosylation sites than the randomly extracted s/t sites from protein sequences with no experimentally verified glycosylation sites: total absence of experimentally verified glycosylation sites could simply mean that the sequence may not have been experimentally analyzed.

a third difference between our approach and that of li et al.  <cit>  has to do with the procedure used for performance evaluation. the positive and negative instances in the dataset used in  <cit>   are filtered such that no two windows share sequence identity greater than 40%. "leave-one-out" window-based cross-validation is performed to evaluate their classifiers. the instances in our dataset are sequence windows of length  <dig> with the target residue in the middle and  <dig> neighboring residues on each side. we have used instead, sequence-based 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate our classifiers. as noted in  <cit> , window-based cross-validation is likely to yield overly optimistic estimates of commonly used performance measures, such as accuracy and matthews correlation coefficient, relative to the estimates obtained using sequence-based cross-validation. because classifiers trained on labeled sequence data have to predict the labels for residues in a novel glycoprotein sequence, the estimates obtained using sequence-based cross-validation provide more realistic estimates of the performance of a classifier than those obtained using window-based cross-validation.

a fourth key difference between the approach of li et al.  <cit>  and our approach has to do with the machine learning methods used. li et al. used a single svm. to get around the bias of svm towards the negative class due to highly unbalanced dataset , they experimented with different ratios of positive and negative instances to train svm classifiers. that is, the number of negative instances is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> times the number of positive instances. instead, we used an ensemble of svm classifiers, trained on the original distribution of the data extracted from the original glycoprotein sequence dataset, with each svm in the ensemble trained on a balanced subsample of the training data.

because of the differences between our study and the study of li et al.  <cit>  noted above, it is not especially meaningful to directly compare the results of their study with ours. however, in the case of o-linked glycosylation sites, because the svm based on 0/ <dig> system in  <cit>  is the same as the single svm with 0/ <dig> string kernel from balanced data in our study, it is worth noting that the ensemble of svms outperforms single svm in predicting o-linked glycosylation sites. the roc curve of the ensemble of svms dominates the roc curve of single svm for reasonably high values of sensitivity . moreover, the ensemble of svms achieves a larger auc than the single svm, and thus a larger overall probability of correct prediction for o-linked glycosylation sites .

CONCLUSIONS
glycosylation plays important roles in protein folding, protein localization, trafficking, cell-cell interaction, developmental processes, etc  <cit> . with the rapid increase in the amount of data  there is a growing need for reliable procedures to accurately identify glycosylation sites.

in this study, we have presented a successful application of machine learning methods to identification of glycosylation sites from amino acid sequence of proteins. specifically, we systematically evaluated single support vector machines, as well as ensembles of support vector machines in a sequence-based k-fold cross-validation setup  <cit> . the results of our experiments demonstrate that ensembles of svms outperform single svms in terms of a range of standard measures for comparing the performance of classifiers. the reliability with which n-, o-, and c-linked glycosylation sites are predicted in this study suggests that these classifiers, available online  <cit> , can provide valuable information to guide experimental investigations. as more data from high-throughput experimental glycomics projects become available, it should be possible to further improve the reliability of predictions. such data are needed to develop models that not only predict the sites of glycosylation, but that also capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of protein glycosylation that regulate developmental and immunological processes of clinical importance.
