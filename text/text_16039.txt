BACKGROUND
the majority of the significant results from genome wide association studies  fall outside of coding regions, leading to the conclusion that the causal variants tagged by many gwas hits function through the control of genomic regulation, e.g. regulation of gene expression  <cit> . not surprisingly, e qtls are frequently employed to prioritize gwas hits with the aim of linking a variant with a gene; expecting to provide a better biological insight via the wealth of gene based knowledge acquired during the last decades. likewise, epigenetic marks are employed in a similar manner to get an insight into the possible regulatory mechanism behind gwas hits. whereas dna methylation has been long associated with epigenetic inheritance, recent work clearly demonstrates that genetic factors explain a substantial proportion of the variability of dna methylation in humans, with the average narrow sense heritability being approximately  <dig>   <cit> . similar to eqtls, mqtls were mapped in the last five years in a few studies across multiple tissues including both cis  and trans  <cit>  snp to methylation site associations.

the relationship between gene expression and dna methylation has been long recognized  <cit> . more recent work has shown both positive and negative correlations between these traits  in humans. this is consistent with a possible shared genetic control of gene expression and dna methylation, and indeed the overlap in genetic control of expression and methylation has been assessed in several recent studies . there are three types of biological samples examined across these published studies:  purified primary cell types employed with a relatively small sample size  <cit>   tissue  with no control over specific composition of cell types  <cit> , and  immortalized cell lines  <cit>  that often do not represent physiological patterns of expression  <cit>  and methylation in their parental cell type. the aim of this study is to provide an assessment of the shared genetic control between gene expression and dna methylation while avoiding the above pitfalls.

we employed the brisbane systems genetics study  dataset which has previously been used to estimate the heritability of gene expression and dna methylation and for e/mqtl mapping  <cit>  in the whole blood. the dataset consists of gene expression, dna methylation, high-density dna genotypes and wealth of phenotypes, including whole blood cellular composition. the study is family-based with mz/dz twin pairs, their full-siblings and parents. this cohort provides a relatively large sample size, data from primary cells and the ability to control for cell type composition of the whole blood, avoiding many of the pitfalls of previous studies in this area.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> individuals from the bsgs data set had both gene expression and dna methylation measures as well as high density genotypes  <cit> . after low-level qc and normalization, expression and methylation probes values were corrected for batch, sex and age effects . we removed probes with snps in them  <cit>  and probes on sex chromosomes. the final dataset consisted of  <dig>  and  <dig>  expression and methylation probes respectively that survived all filtering and qc steps, resulting in ≈ <dig> ×  <dig> possible pairwise comparisons .fig.  <dig> summary of the analysis workflow



cellular composition of the whole blood drives correlation structure between expression and methylation values
the pairwise pearson correlation  was calculated between all pairs of expression and methylation probes. assuming bivariate normal distribution for expression-methylation values for each probe pair, the fisher z transformation of the correlation coefficient allows us to obtain asymptotic p-values  based solely on the correlation coefficient and sample size  <cit> . the number of probe pairs that survived a bonferroni correction threshold of  <dig> / was  <dig> , <dig>  in order to simplify initial analysis of the correlation structure, we restricted our attention to probe pairs that pass bonferroni threshold and have a correlation |ρ|≥ <dig> . given a maximum sample size of  <dig> individuals  any correlation coefficient |ρ|≥ <dig> . was deemed significant. the correlation structure among those probes was visualized as a graph where the nodes denote expression/methylation probes and the edges corresponds to a correlation of |ρ|≥ <dig>  between the probes . by following the edges from one node to another we can define subsets of connected nodes,known as graph components  <cit> . the resulting graph consisted of  <dig> components, with the largest component containing  <dig> nodes and  <dig> small components with median number of nodes equal  <dig> 

we utilized gene expression and dna methylation data from facs sorted blood cell types to access the cell-type specificity of expression and methylation probes from the largest graph component. those purified cell-types data sets consist of dna methylation data from reinius et al.  <cit>  and gene expression data from primary cell atlas  <cit> . the methylation dataset consists of cd19+ b cells, cd4+ t cells, cd8+ t cells, cd56+ nk cells, monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils cell types and lacks data for basophils in comparison to the cell types that are measured in the bsgs dataset. multiple lines of evidence were used to show the cell type specificity of the methylation and expression probes from the largest correlation graph component. firstly, it was observed that  <dig> out of  <dig> hematopoietic cell-type specific methylation probes from houseman et al.  <cit>  are in the largest graph component. we also performed hierarchical clustering of the purified blood cell  <cit>  samples based on the methylation probes from the largest graph component, and this grouped the samples according to their cellular identity . similarly, the cell type specificity of the expression probes from the largest correlation graph component was addressed with hierarchical clustering of purified blood cell  <cit>  samples  based on the expression probes from the component and these also grouped samples according to their cellular identity .

the observation that the largest graph component represented the majority of the probes in the correlation graph, their cell type specificity  led to the hypothesis that the differential cell counts among individuals are responsible for the majority of the observed correlation structure. adjustment of expression and methylation values for nucleated cell proportions was performed in the  <dig> out of  <dig> samples in our study that had blood cellular composition measured. the correlations were recalculated based on the adjusted values, which dramatically shifted the mean correlation of the top probe pairs  towards zero .fig.  <dig> effect of the adjustment for blood cellular composition on the correlation between expression and methylation. pearson correlation between gene expression and dna methylation before  and after  correction for observed blood cell composition. probe pairs that passed bonferroni correction and had a correlation coefficient of |ρ|≥ <dig>  before adjustment for cellular composition were selected. the probe pairs are split by the relative chromosomal position of the probes in a given pair. the correlations are unchanged after the correction for a small proportion of probe pairs located on the same chromosome. however, the majority of the correlations shifted towards zero. the red line is an identity line



looking at a expression-methylation correlations from a previously published study with similar experimental setup  <cit> , we were able to match  <dig>  out of their  <dig>  and  <dig> out of their  <dig> significantly correlated trans and cis probe pairs respectively in our dataset, where probes were defined as being in cis if located within  <dig> mbp of each other on the same chromosome and in trans otherwise. the authors did not have access to cell counts, but recognized possibility of cell counts biasing correlation estimates. indeed, for those probe pairs in our dataset, the majority of their observed correlations shifted towards zero upon adjustment for cellular composition . the mean of the absolute value of the shift between the correlations before and after the adjustment is  <dig>  and  <dig>  for cis and trans probe pairs respectively. interestingly, a small proportion of the correlations between probes in cis  and same chromosome probe pairs  were robust to the correction for cell proportions in our data.

correcting for cellular composition using predicted cell counts
whole blood cell counts were only available for the twins and their siblings in the bsgs dataset and not their parents. in order to overcome the reduced sample size due to the availability of blood cellular composition, we predicted cell proportions via previously published algorithm that uses dna methylation measurements  <cit>  for all  <dig> samples . the original method predicts  <dig> cell types . to obtain finer grained representation of blood composition we re-trained the method on the data from reinius et al.  <cit>  which allows us to predict  <dig> cell types . figure  <dig> shows a comparison of the correlation coefficients corrected for observed  and predicted  cell proportions. probe pairs for fig.  <dig> are selected based on p-values  from the data corrected on predicted cell proportions.fig.  <dig> adjustment for blood cellular composition based on observed vs predicted cell proportions. pearson correlations between gene expression and dna methylation levels adjusted for observed  and predicted  cell proportions. the probe pairs adjusted for predicted cellular composition that passed the bonferroni significance threshold were selected. the correction for cellular composition was done with either observed or predicted cellular proportions in the  <dig> and  <dig> individuals subsets respectively. the red line is an identity line



the shift of the correlations corrected on observed cellular proportions towards zero indicates that using the predicted cellular composition was unable to remove all of the bias in the observed correlations due to differences in cellular composition. in addition we observed large graph component  in the corrected-on-predicted-proportions graph , with the majority of probes in that component being once again hematopoietic cell type specific, thus demonstrating an unaccounted for bias due to differential cell counts. this is not surprising given that there will always be some variance that is not accounted for by the predictor. given the range of correlations between the predicted and observed cellular proportions r ≈  <dig>  −  <dig>  , we estimated that  <dig> to  <dig> % of the original correlation coefficient  remains when using the predicted cellular proportions to adjust expression and methylation values . we decided to avoid a high level of false positive calls at the expense of a reduced sample size by restricting our analysis to the  <dig> individual subset.

phenotypically correlated expression and methylation probes
in the final  <dig> individual subset where all the gene expression and dna methylation measurements are corrected for the observed cell type proportions, there are  <dig>  probe pairs that passed the bonferroni threshold , which map to  <dig> and  <dig>  unique expression  and methylation  probes respectively. of these probe pairs,  <dig> are located on the same chromosome and  <dig>  otherwise. again, the graph representation of correlation structure can be split into one largest component  and  <dig> components with median number of nodes equal  <dig> . the majority of probes in each probe pair from the largest graph component are located on different chromosomes. this component contains expression probes that related to inflammation and cytotoxic t-cells  , suggesting another not accounted for confounder such as the inflammation status of an individual.fig.  <dig> graph representation of the final correlation structure between gene expression and dna methylation. probe pairs with correlation passing a bonferroni significance threshold after correction for observed cellular composition. each node represents a gene expression  or dna methylation  probe. probes connected with red lines are located on difference chromosomes, while blue lines connect probe pairs on the same chromosome. the majority of connections in the largest graph component are between probes on different chromosomes, unlike the rest of the graph mainly represented by connected probes on the same chromosome



shared qtls
to avoid potential confounding of unobserved factors such as inflammation, we searched for probes sharing expression and methylation qtls and thus are likely to be correlated due to common genetic control underlying their variation. we previously estimated heritabilities of expression and methylation probes in the bsgs dataset as well as performed genome wide qtl mapping  <cit> . probes in the final list  are heritable, with the mean heritability of the expression and methylation probes equal to  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . for each probe in a probe pair located on the same chromosome, we selected all snps with association p-value <10- <dig> for both methylation and expression levels. of  <dig> same chromosome probe pairs  <dig> share at least one qtl at this threshold . these  <dig> probe pairs map to  <dig> genomic regions, of which  <dig> pairs contain expression probe tagging a single gene . the methylation probes from the probe pairs that do not share qtl tend to be less heritable, with a mean heritability of  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  for probes with a shared qtl . whilst expression probes from both shared and non-shared qtl pairs have mean heritability equal  <dig> . a clearer picture is obtained by looking at variance explained by the best m/e snps for each probe. the best esnp  explain  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of variance on average for the expression probes from probe pairs with and without shared qtl respectively. likewise, the best msnp  expain  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of variance on average for the methylation probes from probe pairs with and without shared qtl respectively .

the majority of the probe pairs that do not share a qtl contribute to the largest component , as do probe pairs located on different chromosomes . in contrast, same chromosome probe pairs with shared qtl mainly contribute to the small components of the correlation graph .

of the probe pairs that share qtl,  <dig>  % are located within 1mbp of each other, whilst only  <dig>  % of pairs that do not share a qtl located within this distance. probe pairs with and without shared qtl have a mean absolute value pearson corelation of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively .fig.  <dig> genomic distance between gene expression and dna methylation probes for same chromosome probe pairs. distance between genomic locations of gene expression and dna methylation probes in a same chromosome probe pair and the phenotypic correlation between them split by shared qtl status. same chromosome probe pairs  from the final correlation list were selected. red and green points represent probe pairs without and with shared qtl respectively. the red dashed line is at 1mbp



we observed great variability in the number and proportion of shared snp associated with the expression and methylation levels of a pair which likely represents ld structure at each genomic location . there was  <dig> probe pairs  that had the same best snp from m and e qtl association mappings. the majority of the probe pairs with shared snp  have their best m and e snps within  <dig> mbp window, unlike the probes without a shared qtl .fig.  <dig> distance between the nearest best methylation and expression snps per same chromosome probe pair. distribution of the distance between the nearest most significantly associated methylation and expression snps for same chromosome probe pair split by shared qtl status. no requirement of significance level was enforced on the most associated snp. of  <dig> probe pairs that share qtl  <dig> share their best snps, i.e. it is the same snp which is both best expression and best methylation snp for probes in a probe pair. red dashed line is at 1mbp



concordance in genetic control of expression and methylation levels
we estimated genetic correlations between dna methylation and gene expression for all probe pairs passing bonferroni correction threshold  with bivariate greml utilizing snp based genomic relationship matrix  <cit>   . it is important to note that in this settings snp based grm reconstitutes pedigree structure of the bsgs dataset. probe pairs that share qtl have greater mean genetic correlation − <dig> / <dig>   in contrast to − <dig> / <dig>  and − <dig> / <dig>  for same chromosome probe pairs with no shared qtl and probe pairs on different chromosomes respectively .fig.  <dig> distribution of genetic correlation estimates between gene expression and dna methylation. the estimates split by relative chromosome location and shared qtl status. probe pairs from the final correlation list  were selected. the distribution of the correlations is similar for probe pairs located on different chromosomes and same chromosome probe pairs without shared qtl. probe pairs that share qtl have larger genetic correlations than the rest of probe pairs



discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have quantified the overlap in the regulation of gene expression and dna methylation by looking at genome-wide phenotypic correlations and their underlying cause and by estimating genetic correlation in a mixed model setting.

unlike snp genotypes, both gene expression and dna methylation are affected by environmental factors and by the cell type in which they are measured. it has been recognized that the cellular composition of a tissue under investigation can bias epigenetic association studies  <cit> . blood is a multicellular tissue and there is a continuum of scenarios from cell-type specific to cell-type uniform levels of gene expression and dna methylation. even though there is only a small number  of dna methylation and gene expression probes affected by differential cell counts  <cit>  there are nmeth × nexpr pairs of those probes. the small but consistent association of a particular probe value with a cell type proportion can often be regarded as negligible in a gwas study, however association between two probes of that kind will produce a substantial correlation coefficient. it is therefore not surprising that cell type specific gene expression and dna methylation are indeed at the top of the correlation structure we observed in blood.

taking advantage of a cell type proportion predictor  <cit>  allows us rectify the problem to a great extent with an almost  <dig> times reduction in number of probe pairs surviving bonferroni correction on their estimated correlations. however as with any imperfect predictor there is unaccounted for variance that still causes a problem when we look at the covariance between the traits. given we cannot expect each and every experiment on a complex tissue to have cellular composition recorded it is instructive to understand how much of a correction we can achieve with a given predictor and what other filtering steps might help in such situations. to that extent, we estimated the amount of unaccounted for covariance and utilized genetic data to further filter our probe pairs. moreover additional methylation data on finer grained cell types  will further help in predicting blood cellular compositions, which in turn should improve our ability to control for the cellular heterogeneity in blood.

a graph representation of the correlation structure proves to be helpful in depicting relationships between the probes and confounding. the number of nodes in the largest graph component allowed us to judge the amount of confounding, as it is expected that majority of the correlations should be independent from each other given the power we can achieve with our sample size. the majority of correlated probes joined together to form a large graph component representing  <dig>  % of all nodes in the original graph, which decreases to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % when adjusted for predicted and observed cell counts respectively. at first we thought that removing the largest component and working with the small order components would preserve the true positives and remove confounded signal. however, the majority of the same chromosome probe pairs with shared qtl, and thus genuine correlations, were found to be located within the largest component when the traits were not corrected for cell counts . the expression and methylation probes from the largest component provided strong evidence that the nature of confounding in correlation measures was primarily due to cell count differences. furthermore the largest component in the graph of cell type corrected correlations consists of probes that are located on different chromosomes or same chromosome probes without shared qtl. gene expression probes in the largest component tag inflammation related genes, indicating either the presence of confounding via an inflammation status of an individual or a need for the adjustment for cell proportions with a non-linear model. however, whilst it is unlikely, we cannot exclude the presence of a genuine master regulator  driving this correlation structure.

gene expression and dna methylation are heritable and for at least some loci these have large qtl explaining the majority of their phenotypic variation. hence some snps with large effect sizes are found in association studies, with the majority of the associated snps located within the cis region. we hypothesized that if the phenotypic correlation is mainly driven by a genetic component, then we expect to find snps that explain a substantial proportion of variance for both traits. at the same time, given genotypes are not affected by environmental factors or cellular composition, we expect the phenotypic correlation to be reflective of the genotypic correlation and therefore not confounded .

the probes that are located on the same chromosome but do not share a qtl tend to have their best m and e snps further apart  and on average explain  <dig>  and  <dig>  times less variance compared to the best snps for probes with shared qtl. altogether, this indicates that the most associated snps for probes without shared qtl are background noise and not genuinely associated qtl. interestingly, the bulk of same chromosome probes that share at least one qtl fall within 1mbp window that is often used as the definition of a cis relationship between genetic ranges.

finally, for each probe pair that passed the bonferroni threshold, we estimated the genetic covariance between dna methylation and gene expression in mixed model settings. unlike single snp qtl analysis, bivariate greml captures covariance attributable to the all imputed snps . in the case of single snp analysis we are unable to discover all of the e/mqtls, due to lack of statistical power, whilst greml provides us with overall  estimate of total genetic covariance between dna methylation and gene expression. as expected, probe pairs with shared qtl on average have larger genetic correlations in contrast with the same chromosome probe pairs without shared qtl. we attribute the non-zero genetic correlations for the same chromosome pairs without shared qtl and probe pairs on different chromosomes to be due to selection bias. that is to say, the probes have phenotypic correlation greater than a certain threshold because we selected them to pass the bonferroni threshold.

we have clearly demonstrated the effect of the cell heterogeneity on the correlations between dna methylation and gene expression levels and shown that correction for predicted cell counts is not sufficent to remove these effects. another example where cell heterogeneity possibly plays a role is a case–control studies, where it is possible to find different cell composition of blood  due to the disease status of affected patients . this situation can be further complicated in that predictions developed using normal  cells, may not fully capture the range of cellular content in case samples. in such situation, using observed cell proportions is the best way to perform analysis.

overall we have showed the importance of the need to control tissue heterogeneity for studies of gene expression and dna methylation and employed a graph representation of the correlation structure to gauge possible bias. this and shared e/msnp provided us with a sound basis to select probe pairs to demonstrate shared genetic control between dna methylation and gene expression.
