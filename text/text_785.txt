BACKGROUND
the transition from prokaryote to eukaryote was a hugely important event in the evolutionary history of life and provided the foundations for the evolution of numerous complex organismal forms. present day eukaryotes differ fundamentally from prokaryotes in having much higher complexity of cell organization. this complexity cannot have appeared fully-formed, but arose by stepwise elaborations of cell structure - implying that certain lineages of extant eukaryotes might have retained "simpler" ancestral features . however, the order and relative importance of many of the acquisitions that must have occurred to allow the cellular features now seen in extant eukaryotes remain controversial. by comparing the genomes of a wide taxonomic range of eukaryotes, and including sufficient taxon sampling to account for secondary loss, we can reconstruct the likely genomic composition of the last common eukaryotic ancestor. in this way, it is possible to reconstruct the ancestral repertoire for some of the molecular components of key eukaryotic features and identify evidence for intermediate states, if they exist. this in turn helps us to understand the biology of the ancestral eukaryote and how the prokaryote-eukaryote transition proceeded.

one of the key changes that enabled increased cellular complexity in eukaryotes was the evolution of the cytoskeleton - based ancestrally on actin filaments and tubulin-based microtubules . this network and its associated motors, plays an essential role in several eukaryote-defining cellular processes, including division of genetic material at mitosis and meiosis, inheritance of cytoplasmic organelles, intracellular transport of vesicles, and cellular motility based on either crawling or beating of cilia/flagella. in keeping with this central role, cytoskeletal motor proteins arose early in the eukaryotic lineage  <cit> . of the three superfamilies of motors - kinesins, dyneins, and myosins - only the kinesins are ubiquitous to all eukaryotes thus far analyzed  <cit> . to shed light on the cellular complexity of the last common eukaryotic ancestor, we analyzed the kinesin motor protein superfamily using comparative genomics, protein domain architecture analysis and the most comprehensive supported kinesin motor domain phylogeny to date. from these data, we look at the evolution of the kinesin superfamily across eukaryotes. we also reconstruct the kinesin repertoire of the lcea and infer some of the biological features of this ancestral cell.

RESULTS
diversification of kinesin paralog families
to map the ancient evolutionary history of the kinesin gene family we surveyed  <dig> eukaryotic organisms for which complete or near-complete genome was publicly available. these organisms represent a wide taxonomic diversity of eukaryotes and encompass five of the six proposed eukaryotic 'supergroups'  <cit> . to survey for kinesins, we used a hidden markov model-based strategy  <cit>  using the pfam kinesin motor domain model . this approach identified  <dig> encoded kinesin-like protein sequences . to improve phylogenetic resolution and analysis speed we removed  <dig> sequences with scores < <dig> , representing the most divergent kinesin-like sequences. this threshold is lower than used in previous work  <cit>  and sufficiently liberal to include all the previously identified kinesins from schizosaccharomyces pombe and saccharomyces cerevisiae  - and also include all kinesins from drosophila melanogaster except the atypical cos <dig>  and all but the very-highly divergent vab <dig>  from caenorhabditis elegans. we aligned the motor domains from these  <dig> protein sequences, trimmed the alignment to  <dig> well-conserved characters and removed  <dig> near-identical sequences . from this alignment we calculated a bayesian phylogeny by combining  <dig> independent runs of mrbayes <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . to evaluate support for the inferred tree, we used two approximate likelihood ratio test  methods  <cit> . these methods estimate support for each node by systematically measuring the ratio of the likelihood of the given tree to an alternative topology in which that node has been collapsed . we considered as well-supported only those tree topology nodes with p >  <dig>  by both alrt methods. the identities of these well-supported nodes are largely independent of the amino-acid substitution matrix used in the test .

additional file  <dig> contains a 1263-sequence bayesian phylogeny for the kinesin repertoires encoded by the  <dig> diverse eukaryotes. each of the  <dig> kinesin families defined previously by wickstead and gull  <cit>  in a smaller analysis of  <dig> genomes  were also retrieved here with strong topology support . in addition, based on the criteria set out by lawrence et al.  <cit> , our analysis supports the existence of three new kinesin families, which we name kinesin- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> - to follow on from previously identified families . each of these new kinesin families has strong support and a wide taxonomic distribution amongst the eukaryotes sampled. as in previous work  <cit> , in this extensive phylogeny - which includes full kinesin repertoires from a broad range of eukaryotes - we find no support for kinesin families - <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  <cit> .

our phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for an additional  <dig> paralog groups, which were not part of kinesin families on our phylogenetic tree. each of these paralog groups was well supported, but none are considered bona-fide kinesin families at this stage, either because they lacked sufficient membership  or contained only sequences from one eukaryotic supergroup. we designated these additional tentative paralog families x1-x <dig> . names, unique identifiers and kinesin family/subfamily for all the  <dig> identified kinesins in this study can be found in additional file  <dig> 

by definition, each kinesin family is shared by at least two eukaryotic supergroups  <cit>  and is therefore most likely anciently derived . in addition to these families, our analysis shows that there are multiple paralogs within at least  <dig> kinesin families  that are most likely the products of additional ancient gene duplication events. in keeping with the standardized nomenclature of lawrence et al.  <cit>  we have identified well-supported subfamilies by appending a letter to the family name . in this analysis we have considered two levels of "ancient" paralogy: 1) well-supported kinesin families shared by at least two eukaryotic supergroups, and also 2) subfamilies for which there is evidence at least for the paralog being present at the root of a major taxonomic group . all subfamilies have good topological support .

the identification within several kinesin families of paralogs shared by multiple eukaryotic supergroups suggests that the use of family name alone does not accurately reflect the evolutionary  complexity of the kinesin motor families. our analysis suggests that the evolutionary diversification of the kinesin gene family has been extremely complicated, encompassing at least  <dig> ancient paralogs . the majority of these paralog forms arose from gene duplication events that at least predate the major taxonomic units of eukaryotes  <cit>  and therefore most likely arose in an early phase of eukaryotic evolution. it is worthy of note that our phylogeny  also shows evidence of paralogs in closely related organisms that are the result of relatively recent lineage-specific duplication events. these paralogs are not the focus of this work and will not be discussed at length here, but they demonstrate that kinesin diversification is not restricted to events very early in eukaryotic evolution and gene duplication has generated novel kinesin genes throughout the diversification of the eukaryotes.

diversification of kinesin protein architectures
motor proteins are generally composed of a motor head domain that converts chemical energy to force, and a range of additional domains that bind cargo, filaments or accessory proteins . since regions outside of the motor head domain direct many interactions, considerable functional diversification might be achieved through the evolution of the protein domain combinations. to further investigate the diversification of the kinesin superfamily, we identified putative domain architectures for all  <dig> identified kinesin proteins using pfam and cdd database searches  <cit> . in total we found  <dig> different kinesin protein domain architectures . surprisingly, most domain architectures were specific to only one organism in our analysis, indicating that these domain combinations were relatively recent acquisitions. it is also noteworthy that most kinesins in our analysis  possess no identifiable protein domains outside of the motor itself. this implies that the great majority of the interactions between these motors and other proteins is controlled either by poorly conserved stretches of peptide or protein domains that are not yet described in protein domain databases.

of the  <dig> kinesin domain architectures,  <dig> are found in two or more genomes suggesting an origin predating the last common ancestor of the species that possess this specific domain architecture . by annotating the motor domain phylogeny with the protein domain architectures  it is possible to identify cases where different architectural forms are the result of secondary loss of domains . accounting for these secondary loss events,  <dig> protein domain architectures that were found in multiple genomes were specific to a paralog or family on the kinesin phylogeny, suggesting that they represent derived character states . however, in several cases the phylogeny suggested that the similar protein domain architectures occupied very distant branching positions in the kinesin phylogeny, and were absent from all species that occupied intermediate branches. we investigated this further by comparing the results of pfam and cdd searches and aligning the relevant protein domains. in  <dig> cases we found no convincing alignment between the domains suggesting that these features are not homologous. these domain architectures were therefore excluded from further analysis ' on figure 2). in a further  <dig> cases, following the same principle, we corrected the taxon distribution of a specific domain architecture because the domain found connected to the kinesin motor did not appear to be homologous to the other protein sequences included in that architecture type .

after the exclusion of unreliable and convergent kinesin architectures , a total of  <dig> architectures were identified that potentially represent shared derived characters. these  <dig> characters , were included in our analysis of kinesin protein evolution . several of these domain combinations are widely distributed among the species analyzed, suggesting that the protein domain architecture had an ancient ancestry within the eukaryotes and that shuffling of protein domains linked to the kinesin motor has played an important role in the early diversification of many kinesin protein families.

the kinesin repertoire of the last common eukaryotic ancestor
to investigate the minimum complement of kinesin forms present in the lcea, we mapped the ancestral repertoire of kinesin characters under four alternative eukaryotic evolutionary trees . we coded the presence and absence of kinesin families  and reliable protein architectures  as binary characters. in both cases, these selections included characters that were strongly suggested to be monophyletic . to further ameliorate patterns of secondary loss we coded the presence and absence of kinesin paralogs and architectures by combining the species data into  <dig> higher taxonomic groups . these taxonomic groups are based upon those recovered in several multi-gene phylogenies  <cit> , which have demonstrated a consensus higher level grouping of the eukaryotes. at least  <dig> of the suggested supergroups within eukaryotes  remain contentious  <cit> . to control for this we only used sub-groupings within excavata and chromalveolata that are currently strongly supported. the combination of paralogs and architectures produced a binary data matrix of  <dig> 'taxa' and  <dig> characters. to further investigate the ancestral diversification of kinesin gene families we generated an alternative character matrix based on  <dig> characters produced from only the kinesin subfamily data. we used a dollo parsimony analysis method  <cit>  to investigate the possible branching order of the  <dig> higher taxonomic units and the minimal ancestral repertoire of kinesin characters present in the lcea. dollo parsimony explains the presence of a state by allowing only one genesis event for a character, and as many losses as are necessary to explain the pattern of characters seen  <cit> . the method makes the assumption that the ancestral state is character absence and therefore generates a tree topology that provides the minimum complement of kinesin types present in the common ancestor of all  <dig> genomes sampled.

the phylogenetic branching order and root position of the eukaryotes is a contentious issue. burki et al.  <cit>  have recently performed large-scale phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequence and suggest three major eukaryotic branches: excavates   <cit> , unikonts   <cit>  and a major clade, which encompasses the majority of phototrophic or ancestrally phototrophic eukaryotes   <cit> . many aspects of these groupings are also consistent with other concatenated multi-gene phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . the results of the burki et al. analysis  <cit> , however, did not sample the metamonad genomes   <cit> , which have also been tentatively classified as excavates  <cit>  , but were excluded because these taxa often produce long branches within phylogenetic trees and are therefore potentially a source of artifact in tree inference  <cit> .

as it has been suggested that the metamonad branch may represent the first branch in the eukaryotic phylogeny and the excavates may be paraphyletic to the root of the eukaryotes, the consensus view of the eukaryote phylogeny is a polytomy of four major clades: 1) metamonads ; 2) discicristates, ; 3) unikonts ; and 4) a large 'ancestrally phototrophic' clade   <cit> . therefore, a number of primary branch groups are possible. we used a dollo parsimony approach to compare four topological variations possible within this polytomy  with the results of an unconstrained dollo parsimony analysis . these alternative topologies included a tree that placed the metamonads  as the first branch  <cit>  and a tree topology equivalent to the bikont-unikont model  <cit> .

for comparison we have included the most parsimonious tree generated when using the dollo method without any topological constraint . this is the simplest possible explanation for the extant distribution of the characters if no assumptions are made with regards to the branching order of that tree. the resultant tree is very unlikely to be a realistic eukaryotic phylogeny. however, even given this topology, the lcea possessed a complex repertoire of minimally  <dig> ancestral kinesin families and  <dig> kinesin architectures .

each of the  <dig> likely alternative topologies for eukaryotic evolution implies a slightly different ancestral kinesin repertoire in the lcea . however, our analysis identifies a complex core set of ancestral characters that were present in the lcea under any of these  <dig> tree topologies. these include  <dig> kinesin paralogs - namely, kinesin- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  4/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  9a, 9b,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> - and  <dig> protein domain architectures - kisc, kisc-fha, sam-kisc. this core set will here be referred to as the minimal ancestral repertoire . these results show that a large proportion of the extant diversity of the kinesin superfamily was already established before the radiation of eukaryotes from the lcea. they also strongly suggest that the ancestral eukaryotic cell had a complex biology built around a microtubule-based cytoskeleton.

it is clear that several kinesin families are linked to specific cellular functions  <cit> . however, for some families pleiotropy and a lack of knowledge of function across a broad taxonomic base makes it difficult to unambiguously infer ancestral function. of the  <dig> paralog families in the mar, at least three have conserved functions in nuclear division  that are most likely ancestral to the whole family. from this, we can infer that the lcea built a bidirectional spindle containing both plus-end directed  and minus-end directed  motors  <cit> . the presence of these antagonistic motors suggests that, even in early eukaryotic cells, spindle construction relied on generation of counteracting pole-to-pole forces . alongside these spindle motors, the lcea encoded a kinesin- <dig> microtubule depolymerizing motor  <cit> , possibly embedded in the kinetochores, as it is in several extant species examined  <cit> . it is credible to suggest that the kinesin- <dig> and kinesin-4/ <dig>  were also part of this ancestral nuclear division mechanism. however, the identification of significant alternative roles for these families outside of nuclear division  <cit> , makes the possibility of this being the ancestral function tentative.

the presence of kinesin- <dig> and - <dig> paralogs in the mar, suggests strongly that the lcea had the capacity to traffic membrane-bound bodies within the cytoplasm  <cit> . this implies that the ancestral cell built cytoplasmic microtubules and processed vesicular traffic - in agreement with the wide taxonomic distribution of many additional components of the eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system in extant eukaryotes  <cit> .

notably, none of the four trees representing alternative hypotheses encompassed by the eukaryotic ancestral polytomy model represents the most parsimonious topology under the dollo approach. the most parsimonious explanation of the observed data  is clearly inconsistent with any current views of the eukaryotic branching order. the placing of amoebozoa as the primary eukaryotic branch is almost certainly an artifact caused by the lack of flagella/cilia and the associated loss of kinesins with ciliary function in the two amoebozoa for which complete genome data is publicly available. such artifact has been described previously  <cit> . consistent with the hypothesis that the positioning of the amoebozoa in unconstrained trees is an artifact of ciliary loss, the ancestral repertoire implied by the most parsimonious unconstrained tree is the mar set without the families associated with cilia/flagella  <cit>  . we investigated what evidence for kinesin paralogs might be available from expressed sequence tag sequencing of amoebozoan organisms which build flagella. however, only  <dig> and  <dig> kinesin motor fragments are contained in the expressed sequence tag libraries for mastigamoeba and hyperamoeba, respectively from tbestdb  <cit> . of these, the mastigamoeba sequences could be placed with reasonable confidence into the kinesin-14a and kinesin- <dig> groups .

finally, the mar, as defined by comparison of  <dig> alternative eukaryote topologies above, shows that the lcea had a cilium/flagellum. kinesin- <dig> is the anterograde motor of the intraflagellar transport  machinery - a series of components critical for building and servicing cilia/flagella . in chlamydomonas, the protein klp <dig>  is a part of the central apparatus of the cilia  <cit> , although the level of conservation of this function is yet to be widely assessed. for two of the mar paralogs - kinesin-9b and kinesin- <dig> - there is currently no published functional data at all. however, the presence of kinesin- <dig>  9a, 9b and  <dig>  and also the non-mar family kinesin- <dig>  only in organisms which build flagella/cilia at some stage in their lifecycle  predicts an ancestral role associated with this organelle.

CONCLUSIONS
the microtubule-based cytoskeleton in extant eukaryotes - with its motors and accessory proteins - is vastly more complex than the prokaryotic ftsz-based system from which it evolved . it is used in many of the cellular processes that define eukaryotes. yet there is little molecular evidence for the timing of the acquisition of several of these key features. here, we have explored the evolution of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton through the evolution of its kinesin motors. we have used genomic information from  <dig> diverse eukaryotes to produce the most extensive kinesin phylogeny to date, for which we have derived statistical support. we have used this to define  <dig> anciently-derived kinesin paralogs, contained within  <dig> kinesin families and  <dig> subfamilies. we also defined  <dig> gene architectures for the  <dig> kinesin sequences included in the analysis - of which only  <dig> architectures are shared between the major taxonomic groups in our analysis.

the branching order of the major lineages of eukaryotes is still a contentious issue. however, by accounting for multiple possible topologies, as well as secondary loss, we have shown that a minimum of  <dig> kinesin families were present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor. the prevailing trend in current models of early eukaryotic cell evolution is the proposal of stepwise acquisition of cellular complexity with particular extant eukaryotic lineages being identified as derived from intermediary and primitive phases of early eukaryotic evolution . this idea is contradicted by the results presented here, which demonstrate that, at least for the kinesin-driven cytoskeleton, the lcea already possessed a highly complex cellular form before giving rise to any of the sampled extant eukaryotic groups. this proto-eukaryotic cell was surprisingly highly developed in terms of kinesin motor types - containing the majority of families now found in eukaryotes. in contrast, the domain architectures of these motors have been much more extensively modified during diversification of lineages, such that only  <dig> can be unambiguously traced back to the lcea. these results are consistent with a growing body of literature which suggests that the lcea had a highly complex cellular form. alongside the complex kinesin repertoire shown here, this ancestral cell possessed genes encoding the major cellular components of meiosis  <cit> , a derived and complex dna replisome  <cit> , and many components required for endocytosis  <cit>  and probably phagotrophy  <cit> .

the kinesin types present in the lcea provide molecular evidence for some of the cellular processes present in the proto-eukaryote. the lcea had nuclear division machinery that included antagonistic motors to generate tension and kinetochore-associated microtubule depolymerizing agents. it also trafficked vesicles along cytoplasmic microtubules and built an axoneme with a central apparatus . the data presented here also show that, although there have been significant gene duplication events within the kinesin families , the history of kinesins is in many cases a history of paralog loss from an ancestral form which possessed a motor repertoire more complex than many extant organisms.
