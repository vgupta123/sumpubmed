BACKGROUND
multiple pathways control growth and development. brs received particular attention when br-deficient and br-insensitive mutants were identified  <cit> . loss of br action results in extreme dwarfism. leaves, internodes, and roots of br-mutants show reduced size and growth of reproductive organs can be impaired  <cit> . the growth-promoting effect of br is largely based on the promotion of cell expansion, though br may also enhance cell proliferation in leaves  <cit> . the most prominent direct br-effect is the modification of gene expression patterns. in fact, br action requires genomic events, and numerous approaches have identified br-regulated genes  <cit> . the identified genes and physiological studies suggest that br controls cell wall modifications, organisation of microtubules and cellulose microfibrils, aquaporin activity, and photosynthesis  <cit> . br-regulated genes also include putative signalling components, among these the exo protein   <cit> . exo gene expression is a strong indicator of br-responses in vegetative tissues. br-deficient mutants showed weak exo expression, whereas br application to the wild-type resulted in elevated exo transcript levels  <cit> . the br-hypersensitive bes1-d mutant exhibited constitutive exo expression  <cit> . exo overexpression resulted in stronger shoot and root growth in wild-type plants  <cit> . however, overexpression of exo in the br-deficient dwf1- <dig> mutant did not normalize dwarfism  <cit> . exo action apparently requires the presence of further br-dependent factors.

the transgenic line atem <dig> contains a t-dna insertion in the exo promoter. the exo mrna level was strongly reduced in these plants. however, the plants did not show an abnormal phenotype  <cit> . likewise, inhibition of exo expression by means of rna interference did not result in an abnormal phenotype  <cit> . the lack of phenotypic changes in either approach could be due to genetic redundancy, or the exo mutant phenotype could become evident only under certain growth conditions. alternatively, the remaining exo mrna in the atem <dig> and rnai lines could be sufficient to maintain proper protein levels  <cit> .

here we report on the characterization of an exo knock-out mutant that shows dwarfism. we show that diminished growth of exo is due to reduced cell expansion rather than impaired cell proliferation. exo is an extracellular protein that modifies br-induced growth responses. expression profiling experiments identified exo-regulated genes. the potential molecular mode of action of exo is discussed.

RESULTS
the exo/exl protein family
eight homologous proteins including exo form a protein family in arabidopsis . structurally conserved proteins were identified in dicots such as tobacco  <cit> , potato  <cit> , wine grape and black cottonwood, and monocots such as rice and sorghum bicolor, the conifer picea sitchensis, and the moss physcomitrella patens. the genome of the soil bacterium solibacter usitatus also encodes a putative phi1/exo-like protein of  <dig> amino acids . no further homologs were identified in bacteria, archaea, fungi, animals, and protists. a phylogenetic tree is shown in figure s <dig>  the conserved region comprises almost the complete primary structure of about  <dig> amino acids .

exo and exl expression patterns
the atgenexpress development series  <cit>  was used to analyze transcript levels in different organs. strong exo expression was observed in rosette leaves, cotyledons, and roots. senescing leaves and pollen displayed little exo expression . flower organs  had varying mrna levels. the exo-like <dig> , exl <dig>  and exl <dig> genes showed expression patterns similar to exo . the spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated for the exo/exl gene pairs . expression of the exl <dig> gene  was closely associated with exo expression. the correlation coefficient accounted for ρ =  <dig>  in all profiles and ρ =  <dig>  in profiles of vegetative tissues . exl <dig>  and exl <dig>  gene expression correlated positively with exo expression as well . associated expression of genes may indicate a common role in physiological processes or pathways. interestingly, exl <dig>  exl <dig>  and exl <dig> expression was also induced by br . in contrast, mrna levels of the remaining four exl genes  were not altered upon br-application, and were not associated with exo expression .

the exo protein is required for shoot and root growth
an exo knock-out mutant   <cit>  was identified which carries a single insertion in the exo coding sequence . growth of exo plants was reduced in soil and in synthetic medium . fresh weight and dry weight of exo shoots were diminished in comparison to the wild-type. the exo plants produced  <dig> to 60% of the wild-type fresh and dry weight in six independent experiments . in further independent growth experiments, biomass production was reduced to a variable extent. in three experiments, exo fresh weight was reduced to approximately 40% of the wild-type level, whereas in three other experiments the mutant produced up to 81% of the wild-type fresh weight . differences in biomass production of soil-grown plants may depend on the light conditions which could not be fully controlled in the greenhouse.

fresh and dry weight was determined from soil-grown plants in three independent experiments . in addition, fresh weight was determined from plants grown on half-concentrated ms medium in plates  or jars . student's t-test p-values  were below  <dig>  in all experiments.

root length of plants grown on vertically oriented plates was determined.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> d old exo roots were  <dig>   <dig>  and 19% shorter in comparison to the wild-type, respectively . loss of exo function did not affect organ formation. for example, the regular number of flower organs was formed, and fertility was not impaired. the exo mutant showed a slight tendency to delayed flowering. the opposite trend was observed in 35s::exo plants . an exo overexpression construct  was transformed into the exo mutant. exo expression under control of the 35s promoter restored the wild-type phenotype . expression of an exo:ha fusion protein under control of the 35s promoter also restored the wild-type phenotype in exo . these results demonstrate that the mutant phenotype was caused by the t-dna insertion in the exo coding sequence.

plants were grown in vertically oriented plates on  <dig>  × ms medium. root length was determined  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after sowing. student's t-test p-values were below  <dig>  in all experiments.

another t-dna insertion line  was supposed to carry a t-dna insertion in the exo coding sequence. in fact, pcr using the lbb <dig> primer  and an antisense primer for the 3'utr of exo resulted in a  <dig>  kb fragment and confirmed an insertion in the exo coding sequence. however, no homozygous mutant plants were identified though all plants were resistant to kanamycin. therefore, the mutant was back-crossed with the col- <dig> wild-type and the f <dig> generation was screened for homozygous plants. pcr analysis of  <dig> plants indicated that none carried an insertion in the exo gene in both chromosomes. this observation may suggest that a second insertion close to the exo gene impaired development of homozygous plants.

loss of exo results in reduced cell size
leaf size is determined by variation in cell size and number. small leaf size of exo could be based on impaired cell expansion, cell proliferation, or a combination of both. rosette leaves of wild-type and exo were subjected to anatomical analysis. leaf thickness  and leaf area were reduced in exo . epidermal cells of exo and wild-type plants were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy  and found to be smaller in the exo mutant . histological analysis of subepidermal palisade cells in mature rosette leaves revealed reduced cell expansion in exo . furthermore, transverse sections of fully expanded leaves showed that palisade and spongy parenchyma cell areas in exo were significantly smaller in comparison to the wild-type . thus, exo is required for cell expansion.

plants were grown in soil for  <dig> days. the 5th or 6th rosette leaves were embedded in 4% agarose and sectioned through the widest part of the blade for transverse sections .

dwarf mutants are frequently characterized by both smaller cells and a decrease in the total number of palisade cells  <cit> . the total number of palisade cells of the 5th or 6th rosette leaf was estimated. the exo mutant showed a tendency to fewer cells in comparison to the wild-type, but differences were not consistent in independent experiments . thus, exo has no major effect on leaf cell number of soil-grown plants.

exo is an apoplastic protein
the subcellular localisation of exo was analyzed using an ha-tagged exo protein under control of the 35s promoter. introduction of the 35s::exo:ha construct into the exo background normalized growth , demonstrating that the fusion protein is functional. western-blot analysis showed that the exo:ha protein was stable in the transgenic plants . the 35s::exo:ha construct was transformed into col- <dig> wild-type plants, and leaves of transgenic plants were embedded in technovit  <dig>  the exo:ha protein was detected using an anti-ha antibody and a secondary antibody coupled to fitc. the exo:ha protein was detected in the cell wall . only weak background fluorescence was detected in non-transgenic col- <dig> plants. furthermore, a 35s::exo:gfp construct was stably introduced into arabidopsis wild-type plants. green fluorescence was detected in the apoplast. plasmolysed cells showed fluorescence in the apoplast as well . these findings are in line with the predictions of sequence analysis tools such as targetp  <cit>  and predotar  <cit>  which state that all members of the arabidopsis exo/exl protein family are cell wall-associated. in addition, proteomics approaches also identified the exo, exl <dig>  exl <dig>  exl <dig>  and exl <dig> proteins as part of the cell wall proteome  <cit> . thus, exo is an extracellular protein, and the other members of the protein family are also likely to be transported into the apoplast.

exo modifies br responses
wild-type, exo, and complemented exo plants were grown under aseptic conditions in the presence of different brassinolide  concentrations. cotyledon length, cotyledon width, hypocotyl length, and root length were determined. in the absence of exogenous bl, cotyledon length and cotyledon width were significantly reduced in exo compared to wild-type and complemented exo plants . br application resulted in larger cotyledons. however, the relative increase was significantly reduced in exo . introduction of the 35s::exoga construct normalized cotyledon growth. hypocotyls were slightly longer in exo in the absence of br . the exo hypocotyls showed a diminished response to bl. relative hypocotyl elongation was significantly reduced in comparison to the wild-type . the observations suggest that exo is required for br-induced growth in above ground organs.

the br-response of roots was also tested. inhibition of root growth by bl was significantly increased in exo compared to the wild-type . introduction of the 35s::exoga construct normalized exo root growth. thus, loss of exo results in br-hypersensitive roots. since this finding does not hold true for shoot organs, which are less br-responsive in exo plants, the exo protein may play a diverse and tissue-specific role in the control of br responses in the root.

exo-dependent gene expression
wild-type and exo plants were grown in a greenhouse for  <dig> days in three independent experiments. affymetrix ath <dig> microarrays were hybridized with labelled crna prepared from above ground plant material. ten genes  showed significantly weaker expression in the exo mutant than in wild-type plants. wak <dig>   <cit>  transcript levels were reduced approximately  <dig> -fold in the mutant. five genes showed significantly stronger expression in exo . several other up- and down-regulated genes encode enzymes of the primary or secondary metabolism.

wild-type and exo plants were grown in soil in three independent experiments and gene expression profiling was carried out by means of affymetrix ath <dig> microarrays. log <dig> fold changes  were determined from col-0/exo signal ratios. a log <dig> fc ratio of one indicates a fc of two. fdr-adjusted p-values were calculated using the approach of benjamini & hochberg. filtering criteria: average log <dig> fc ≥  <dig> or log <dig> fc ≤ - <dig> and adjusted p-value ≤  <dig> .

the br-regulated exp <dig> and kcs <dig> genes were previously reported to be under control of exo in arabidopsis c <dig> plants  <cit> . expansins play an essential role in cell wall loosening  <cit> , and the fatty acid elongase, kcs <dig>  catalyses very long chain fatty acid synthesis in vegetative tissues  <cit> . real-time rt-pcr analysis demonstrated weaker exp <dig> and kcs <dig> expression in the exo mutant in comparison to col- <dig> wild-type plants . the differences in kcs <dig> and exp <dig> transcript levels diminished with increasing plant age . similar development-dependent differences in kcs <dig> and exp <dig> expression were also observed in plants grown in synthetic medium . weak kcs <dig> and exp <dig> expression may represent one reason for diminished br-induced growth in exo shoots.

wild-type and exo plants were grown in soil. rna was extracted from rosette leaves of 10-, 30-, and  <dig> day-old plants. eif1α ct values were subtracted from respective ct values of the gene of interest resulting in dct. subsequently, differences were subtracted from an arbitrary value . higher numbers indicate higher transcript levels. ddct results from subtracting exo from wt. a ddct of one cycle indicates a fold change  of two. error: se of gene of interest in three technical replicates. the experiment was carried out independently three times, representative examples of observed values are shown. for sequences of real-time rt-pcr primer pairs see  <cit> .

however, the vast majority of known br-regulated genes  did not show significantly altered transcript levels in exo. in line with this finding, we previously showed that exo overexpression does not result in altered transcript levels of br-regulated genes such as dwf <dig> and cpd  <cit> . thus, exo is not a key control element for br-responsive gene expression in the shoot.

discussion
structure and subcellular localisation
exo:gfp and exo:ha fusion proteins were detected in the apoplast . other extracellular proteins such as arabinogalactan-proteins  are attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor. however, analysis of the exo primary structure did not reveal a gpi modification site, and plasmolysis experiments showed that the exo protein was not associated with the plasma membrane . cell wall proteins are embedded in a polysaccharide matrix and it can be difficult to extract them. bayer et al.  <cit>  identified the exo, exl <dig> , and exl <dig>  proteins in extensively washed cell wall preparations. this finding suggests a tight association with the wall. on the other hand, borderies et al.  <cit>  recovered extracellular proteins by washing arabidopsis cell suspension cultures with salts and chelating agents. they aimed to identify loosely bound cell wall proteins and results were critically evaluated with respect to the integrity of the plasma membrane of the cells. exo was among the  <dig> identified proteins. in line with the observation of borderies et al.  <cit> , ha-tagged exo protein could be extracted readily from 35s::exo:ha transgenic plants using a standard method for the isolation of soluble proteins . thus, a fraction of the exo protein is loosely bound to the cell wall, though another fraction may strongly interact with cell wall components.

exo mediates cell expansion
the exo mutant showed reduced leaf size, root length, and biomass production. reduced leaf size in exo is due to diminished expansion of epidermis and parenchyma cells. it was shown that exo gene expression is br-dependent  <cit>  and under control of the bes <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . different experiments were performed to test the role of exo in br-responses. the exo mutant showed diminished cotyledon and hypocotyl elongation in response to exogenous bl  indicating that exo is involved in br-promoted cell expansion. it was shown before that exo overexpression in the br-deficient dwf1- <dig> mutant did not normalize growth  <cit> . similarly, introduction of the 35s::exoga construct did not normalize the phenotype of the br-deficient det <dig> mutant . thus, exo is necessary but not sufficient to mediate br-promoted growth. expression profiling experiments demonstrated that exo controls only a subset of br-regulated, growth-related genes such as kcs <dig> and exp <dig>  br-deficiency and br-insensitivity go along with changes in transcript levels of numerous genes  <cit> . since most br-regulated genes were normally expressed in the exo mutant, it appears that exo does not generally affect br sensitivity and br levels in the shoot. our expression profiling experiments revealed further genes with altered expression levels in exo compared with the wild-type . for example, at5g <dig> and wak <dig> are expressed at lower levels in the mutant. at5g <dig> encodes an udp-glucose 6-dehydrogenase that could be involved in the synthesis of cell wall precursors. wak <dig> is a transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic ser/thr kinase domain and an extracellular domain which interacts with cell wall pectins  <cit> . the wall-associated kinases  are likely to be involved in signalling between the cell wall and the cytoplasm, and could play a role in development and cell expansion  <cit> .

thus, exo is likely to act downstream of the known br-signalling pathway in the shoot. the protein may mediate br-induced growth via modifications of cell wall properties and metabolism. br-hypersensitivity of exo roots suggests that exo plays a root-specific role in the control of br-responses. the molecular basis of this finding is unknown.

the plant extracellular proteome may comprise  <dig> different proteins  <cit> . the phi1/exo proteins do not show similarities to proteins with known functions, and thus may have enzymatic or signalling functions that are unknown to date. our hypothesis is that exo integrates cellular, metabolic, and/or environmental factors, and feeds this information into an unknown signalling pathway which controls cell wall properties and metabolic pathways. the br-hypersensitivity of exo roots contrasts with the diminished br-response of exo shoot organs. further studies will address the root-specific phenotype and a potential role of exo in the control of br-responses in roots.

the exo, exl <dig>  exl <dig>  and exl <dig> genes showed associated expression in different plant tissues . the similar structure of the exo, exl <dig>  exl <dig>  and exl <dig> proteins, the associated expression in different organs, and the common control of expression by br suggests that all four proteins may play a role in growth control. genetic redundancy of the exo/exl genes could account for the relative mild phenotypic alterations of exo in comparison to br-deficient or br-insensitive plants. the generation and analysis of mutants in several exo/exl genes may address this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
the exo protein represents a class of proteins that occurs widely in the plant kingdom. it is localized to the cell wall and mediates cell expansion. exo presumably is involved in signalling processes that coordinate br-responses with environmental or developmental signals.
