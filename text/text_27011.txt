BACKGROUND
amrz is a regulatory protein belonging to the arc family of regulators that contains a ribbon-helix-helix  dna binding domain. it is encoded in the genomes of all strains of the genus pseudomonas sequenced so far. amrz appears to be an important regulator in pseudomonas aeruginosa, since a null mutant is severely impaired in a murine in vivo pathosystem, being displaced by the wild-type strain
 <cit> . amrz was originally described as algz, because of its role in the regulation of alginate synthesis in p. aeruginosa <cit> . in this bacterium, amrz is essential for alginate production and is required for transcriptional activation of algd expression
 <cit> . therefore, conversely to other rhh proteins that are transcriptional repressors, amrz was originally identified as an algd activator. however, it has been shown that amrz binds to its own promoter repressing its transcription
 <cit> . it has also been shown that amrz represses the production of the aggregative polyssacharide psl, which is implicated in biofilm architecture
 <cit> . the repression of psl production occurs at the transcriptional level, by binding to a region overlapping the psla promoter
 <cit> . therefore amrz is an atypical rhh protein possessing both transcriptional activation and repression activity. the x-ray crystal structure of amrz binding to the amrz and algd promoters has shown that amrz uses different interactions for repression and activation
 <cit> .

expression of amrz depends on the sigma factor algu 
 <cit> . algu itself is implicated not only in alginate production, but it is required for the environmental control of the expression of multiple virulence and adaption traits in several species of pseudomonads
 <cit>  and it is considered a general stress response sigma factor
 <cit> .

besides exopolysaccharide production, amrz is implicated in the regulation of motility. amrz controls twitching motility  and pili biogenesis in p. aeruginosa in a way that requires the dna binding activity
 <cit> . however, in this case, the precise function of amrz as a transcriptional regulator has not been determined. flagella mediated motility is also regulated by amrz. in mucoid p. aeruginosa strains, such as those which appear in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, amrz represses the transcription of the master flagellar regulatory gene fleq, resulting in aflagellated cells
 <cit> . regulation was shown to involve binding of amrz to the fleq promoter, although conversely to the algd and amrz promoters, the precise protein-dna interactions have not been determined.

pseudomonas fluorescens f <dig> is a biocontrol strain
 <cit>  and a model for plant rhizosphere colonization
 <cit> . in this strain, amrz regulates swimming motility by downregulating the expression of fleq. f <dig> amrz and algu mutants show a hypermotile phenotype caused by overproduction of flagella components
 <cit> . hypermotility in this strain has been related with enhanced competitive colonization of the rhizosphere
 <cit>  where it has been shown to be more important than the ability to form biofilms
 <cit> . considering the importance of amrz for the ecological fitness of pseudomonads and taking advantage of the full sequencing and annotation of the f <dig> genome
 <cit>  we have performed a chip-seq analysis, in order to determine the amrz binding sites and its possible regulatory roles.

RESULTS
amrz binds to multiple sites in the f <dig> chromosome
10 ng of immunoprecipitated dna pooled from  <dig> independent chip assays  were used to generate an illumina library. sequencing of the library yielded  <dig> sequences of  <dig> nucleotides with over 90% of sequences above q <dig> quality. around 93% of the original reads were conserved after trimming and cleaning  and 94% of the former sequences aligned with the genome sequence of p. fluorescens f <dig>  by defining a stringent cut-off ,  <dig> peaks were detected, suggesting that amrz is a global regulatory protein. figure 
1a shows the distribution of these peaks along the f <dig> genome, showing that the peaks are not concentrated in specific regions but uniformly distributed along the whole chromosome.  <dig> of the peaks  were mapped to intergenic regions. since the percentage of intergenic regions in the f <dig> genome is of only 13%, the results show a very strong bias of the putative amrz binding sites to intergenic regions where most promoter regions lie, suggesting again the role of amrz as a transcriptional regulator. because of gene orientation, for most intergenic regions , the peak could be assigned to the upstream region of at least one gene. when only one gene was located in an appropriate orientation, the binding site was assigned to this gene. in the case of peaks located in intergenic regions between two divergent genes, the binding site was initially assigned to both genes. additional file
 <dig> shows the assignation of peaks to genes. it is interesting to note that peaks were detected upstream of its known targets in p. aeruginosa, algd and amrz <cit> . however, no peak was found upstream of fleq, whose promoter region has been shown to bind to amrz in p. aeruginosa <cit> . since in p. fluorescens f <dig>  amrz represses fleq expression
 <cit>  the transcriptional regulation of fleq by amrz should be indirect in this strain.

in order to validate the peaks, an independent chip assay was performed. primers designed to amplify  <dig> of the detected peaks, including the peaks located upstream of algd and amrz, were used in qpcr assays . the region upstream of fleq was also included in the assay. the dif region was used as a negative control. as shown in figure 
1b, this assay validated all the peaks detected by chip-seq and confirmed the lack of a peak upstream of the fleq gene, indicating again that in f <dig> the transcriptional regulation of fleq by f <dig> is indirect.

amrz putatively binds to a conserved dna motif
in order to determine the putative binding sites of amrz, the  <dig> regions that contained peaks above the defined threshold were analyzed with the motif finder pipeline meme. as shown in figure 
2a, a putative motif was detected . this motif was present in  <dig>  of the peaks  and was generally located in a central position within the peak . the motif is present upstream the amrz and algd genes that have been shown to bind amrz in p. aeruginosa by gel retardation assays
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
2c, this motif was congruent with the amrz binding site demonstrated by crystallographic analysis in the amrz promoter in p. aeruginosa <cit> , showing a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  the motif is also highly conserved in other pseudomonads confirming that it corresponds to an amrz binding site.

amrz regulates the expression of multiple genes in p. fluorescens
gene ontology and interpro analysis of the  <dig> genes to which peaks had been assigned  showed that several functional classes such as motility and chemotaxis, iron homeostasis, signal transduction and transcriptional regulators were overrepresented.
 <dig>  functional classes were assigned by ontogeny analysis. b. expression analysis of selected genes in p. fluorescens f <dig> and an amrz mutant background. relative expression  in the amrz mutant  against f <dig>  is shown. numbers correspond to psf <dig> annotation. expression was determined by qpcr. rna was extracted from cells growing in lb medium at  <dig>  o.d. <dig>  asterisks denote statistically significant differences, p <  <dig> .

amrz was previously shown to regulate motility in p. aeruginosa <cit>  and p. fluorescens <cit> , mainly through repression of the gene fleq, which encodes the master regulator of flagella synthesis. in this analysis,  <dig> motility related genes have been assigned to peaks. although fleq has not appeared in the analysis and does not show the motif in its promoter region, genes related with the synthesis and function of the two flagellar systems present in p. fluorescens f <dig> such as flgz, flhdc, flic <dig> and flgm <dig> are among those putatively regulated directly by amrz. besides these genes, the analysis has also identified as potential amrz targets genes related with chemotaxis, especially  <dig> genes encoding methyl accepting proteins . this represents almost 50% of the mcp encoding genes present in the f <dig> genome
 <cit> .

genes related to iron homeostasis were also overrepresented.  <dig> identified genes, included genes for the production of the siderophore pyoverdine , genes encoding iron uptake related extracytoplasmatic sigma factors  and siderophore receptors: feci, tonb, among others. these results suggest that besides regulating alginate production and chemotactic motility, amrz is a major regulator of iron homeostasis.

the analysis also showed  <dig> genes implicated in regulation and signal transduction as potential amrz targets. interestingly, one of them is algu which encodes a sigma factor required for amrz transcription
 <cit>  and an important node in the regulation of motility
 <cit>  and environmental adaption
 <cit> . if under some circumstances, amrz transcriptionally regulates algu, this regulation would increase the complexity of algu regulation. it has been previously shown that algu is transcriptionally regulated by sadb and post-transcriptionally by the gacas system
 <cit> . algu is also regulated at a post-translational level by antisigma factors and directed proteolysis
 <cit> .

within the signal transduction functional class, a clear overrepresentation was observed for genes encoding proteins implicated in the turn-over of the signaling molecule c-digmp, including  <dig> genes encoding putative diguanylate cyclases and/or c-digmp specific phosphodiesterases. c-digmp is implicated in lifestyle transitions, such as sessility vs. motility or acute infection vs. chronic infection  being frequently dependent on environmental sensing.

taken together these results indicate that amrz is likely to be an important transcriptional regulator implicated in environmental sensing and adaption. the fact that an important number of regulatory and signal transduction proteins are among the potential targets for amrz regulation, indicates that the amrz regulon could be very large. the importance of amrz is also reflected in its conservation along the genus pseudomonas.

in order to analyze the role of amrz in regulation,  <dig> of the genes identified as potential amrz targets and belonging to different functional classes, were tested for expression in a wild-type and an amrz
−
 background. as shown in figure 
3b six of the tested genes including flgz, flhdc, flic <dig>  psf113_ <dig> and psf113_ <dig> were clearly regulated by amrz under the experimental conditions tested . since flhdc encodes the master regulator for the production of the second flagellar apparatus of f113
 <cit> , the results presented show that amrz regulates the production of both flagella. it is interesting to note that amrz regulates the expression of flgz, which encodes a pilz domain protein implicated in the regulation of motility and biofilm formation through sensing intracellular c-digmp levels
 <cit> . a negative result in this experiment does not necessarily means that these genes are not regulated by amrz, but that they do not show regulation under these conditions or that differences in expression are not statistically significant. it must be taken into account that identification of potential amrz targets by chip-seq was performed in cells that were ectopically overexpressing amrz. we have not found a relation between the score of the peaks or presence of the motif  and regulation.

amrz represses the expression of genes implicated in iron homeostasis in p. fluorescens
ten genes which were preceded by a peak and were predicted to encode genes involved in iron homeostasis were selected for further analysis. the selected genes include genes implicated in the production of the siderophore pyoverdine, ferrichrome and hemin receptors and extracytoplasmic sigma factors of the feci family. in order to test iron dependence for transcription we analyzed the expression of these genes under iron limited conditions  and iron sufficient conditions . since iron limitation is more evident at stationary phase , rna was collected at this stage. figure 
4a shows the relative expression of the ten genes. it can be observed that for all of the ten genes, expression was higher under iron limiting conditions. differences were statistically significant  for nine of the genes. these results show that most of the iron related genes putatively regulated by amrz are induced under iron limiting conditions. expression of the ten iron related genes was also analyzed in an amrz
−
 genetic background, under iron limiting conditions. as shown in figure 
4b, for all the ten genes, expression was higher in the amrz mutant background. differences were statistically significant for nine of the tested genes. taken together, these results show that amrz is an important regulator of iron homeostasis in p. fluorescens. under conditions where the stringent fur repression has been removed
 <cit> , amrz may act at the transcriptional level as a negative regulator of iron homeostasis genes, including genes implicated in siderophore production and in collection of iron-siderophore complexes. the biological importance of amrz may be related to the metabolic saving by not overproducing siderophores, which are recyclable
 <cit>  and avoiding the toxicity imposed by hydroxyl anions because of an excessive iron import
 <cit> . regulation of iron homeostasis genes has been shown to be complex and dependent on multiple regulatory circuits. besides the well-known repression through fur during growth on iron sufficient conditions, it has been shown that in pseudomonads these genes are also regulated by the gac/rsm system and by c-digmp levels
 <cit> . the finding that amrz also regulates iron uptake related genes under specific conditions indicates the importance of this process for bacterial fitness and highlights the importance of fine tuning.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here show that rather than a local regulator of motility and alginate production, amrz is a global regulator which may affect the transcription of hundreds of genes all along the chromosome. in the direct regulation of these genes, amrz acts mostly as a transcriptional repressor, as expected from its rhh domain architecture. amrz may also regulate gene expression indirectly through the regulation of genes encoding other transcriptional regulators and signal transduction proteins, notably proteins implicated in the turn-over of the messenger molecule c-digmp. from the ontogeny of the amrz regulated genes and its own dependence on the sigma factor algu, it can be deduced the implication of amrz in regulating traits important for bacterial fitness and adaption to changing environments. the high degree of conservation across pseudomonads with very different lifestyles indicates the importance of amrz for environmental adaption.

among the environment related traits directly regulated by amrz, is iron homeostasis. the results presented here show that a large number of genes implicated in iron uptake are repressed by amrz during growth under iron limiting conditions. these results show that amrz is a newly described regulator of iron homeostasis, which regulates iron uptake in conjunction with the fur system, the gac/rsm pathway and the intracellular levels of c-digmp.
