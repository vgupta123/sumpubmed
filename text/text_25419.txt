BACKGROUND
a common bacterial disease of soybean worldwide is the bacterial blight caused by pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea . the interactions of compatible and incompatible races of psg with different soybean cultivars have been characterized previously  <cit> . compatible interactions allow bacterial growth within the host and disease development, whereas incompatible interactions restrict bacterial multiplication with minimal symptom development through the sacrifice of very few cells in the immediate vicinity of the pathogen by programmed cell death. incompatible interactions lead to a cascade of plant responses triggered by the action of a resistance gene r and the corresponding avirulent pathogen avr gene, which is known as the hypersensitive response   <cit> .

the complex resistance response provoked in such incompatible plant-pathogen interactions have been studied and characterized at the molecular level to a large extent in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  and to a lesser extent in agronomically important crops  <cit> . the inducible defense mechanisms may be local or systemic. local defenses usually involve necrotic changes initiated by ion flux in and out of the cell, followed by the oxidative destruction of cell components by lipid hydroperoxides and reactive oxygen species, in addition to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as phytoalexins and other phenolic compounds. systemic defenses result in the accumulation of anti-microbial compounds in parts of the plant distant from the site of infection. among these defenses are pathogenesis related proteins , defensins, proteinase inhibitors and cell wall components such as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins  and lignin and its precursors. additionally, synthesis of salicylic acid , a signal molecule that regulates systemic and local pathogen-induced defense gene activation, oxidative burst, and pathogen-induced cell death, increases  <cit> .

consequently, many secondary metabolites derived from multiple branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway, including lignins, isoflavonoid-phytoalexins, other phenolic compounds and sa are instrumental in the plant's ability to mount successful defenses to invading pathogens . most studies of the phenylpropanoid pathway to date have investigated the molecular response of individual genes of the pathway. no major systematic or global analysis focused on the many genes from the multiple branches of the pathway  has been reported. although general, global transcriptome changes during defense responses of various plants  to several pathogens  have been examined  <cit> , none of the analyses have thoroughly mined the data with specific emphasis on the overall response of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes. nevertheless, those global studies have shown several groups of up regulated ests representing three main branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway and it appears that all plants examined respond to infection with the induction of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  coumarate coa-ligase  and cynamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  genes. chalcone synthase  a central enzyme in the pathway is consistently induced in all plants examined with the exception of arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition, four isoflavonoid pathway ests were up-regulated in medicago truncatula and soybean  <cit>  and four putative anthocyanin pathway ests in tomato  <cit> .

chs is the key enzyme diverting the substrate, naringenin chalcone to the flavonoid and isoflavonoid branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway that synthesizes the precursor of a large number of secondary metabolites, including proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, flavones, flavonols and isoflavonoid-phytoalexins among others . unlike arabidopsis where only one chalcone synthase  gene exists  <cit>  and the isoflavonoid branch of the pathway appears to be non-existent  <cit> , legumes have multiple family member genes. soybean plants have an 8-member chs family and exhibit tissue compartmentalized expression of the isoflavonoid pathway leading to the synthesis of isoflavones in the roots and cotyledons and an inducible isoflavonoid-phytoalexins synthesis in the leaves of pathogen stressed plants  <cit> .

here we report our findings on the levels of transcript abundance of  <dig> phenylpropanoid pathway genes and the identification of stress-responsive chs gene family member in leaves of soybean  challenged with pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea with or without the avrb gene. transcript abundance patterns obtained using rna from infected leaves in hybridizations to soybean cdna microarrays  <cit>  were, supported and extended further by single gene rna gel blots for five genes of key phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes . real time quantitative rt-pcr was also used to measure the relative transcript levels of the individual chs gene family members in leaf tissues  <dig> hrs after inoculation.

an increase in transcript abundance was observed for most of the analyzed genes with the exception of transcripts of genes whose products function downstream of chalcone isomerase  and are required for the synthesis of flavonols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins . these decreased in abundance as early as  <dig> hrs post-inoculation. the more frequent transcript measurements along the  <dig> hrs post inoculation period in rna gel blots detected temporal fluctuation in transcript abundance for three genes chs, ifs and f3h. a significant finding was the opposite fluctuation in f3h transcript accumulation compared to that of chs and ifs transcripts, revealing that f3h and other downstream genes in the anthocyanin/proanthocyanidin/flavonol pathways are underexpressed during pathogen challenge. thus, our data suggests that flavonols, proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins are not recruited to mount the hypersensitive response in soybean leaves and that their synthesis is in competitive disadvantage with that of the isoflavonoid-phytoalexins. interestingly, f3'h transcripts accumulate continuously  <dig> hrs post inoculation suggesting that this branch of the pathway is participating in the reaction cascade elicited by the defense response and possibly shifting the pathway towards the synthesis of flavones. finally, we also found that all genes of the chs family  except chs <dig> accumulated higher transcript levels during the hypersensitive defense response  triggered by the avirulent pathogen.

RESULTS
transcript profiles of eighteen soybean phenylpropanoid pathway genes during the early response to pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea infection
in an earlier study undertaken to analyze a global differential gene expression during the resistant  versus susceptible responses in leaves of soybean plants inoculated with psg with or without avrb, soybean cdna microarrays  <cit>  were used  <cit> . among the  <dig>  cdnas analyzed there was a subset of cdnas representing  <dig> genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway in soybean as diagramed in figure  <dig>  the resulting transcript profiles of this cdna subset were examined here in further detail and compared to one another to gain an understanding of the timing in transcript accumulation changes occurring during the early hours post inoculation.

for most of the  <dig> genes  multiple ests representing a given gene or gene family were printed in the soybean microarrays. the gene description of each est was based on genbank assignments  <cit>  and tigr  databases annotations as well as sequence analysis and gene identification in our laboratory  <cit> . the 3' and 5' clone ids of the est's are listed in table  <dig>  columns,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. those representing a given gene have been grouped in the same or different tc  according to the tigr database. the different tcs for a given gene annotation possibly represent different family members or perhaps, different regions of the same gene.

the majority of ests representing  <dig> of the genes  hybridized complementary rnas at increasing amounts from  <dig> to  <dig> hrs post inoculation in concurrence with the hr as indicated by the ratios marked in bold type. the highest transcript level increases were detected for the ests of chs, chr, chi, ifs1& <dig>  iomt and ifr <dig> genes, all involved in the synthesis of isoflavanone-phytoalexins as shown in figure  <dig>  significant but more moderate increases were measured for pal, c4h, 4cl, ccr, cad, comt and ccoamt ests. enzymes encoded by the corresponding genes function upstream of chs, and ccr, cad, comt and ccoamt drive the synthesis of lignin. in contrast, transcripts of genes encoding enzymes that function downstream of chi, directing the synthesis of flavonols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins  decreased in abundance significantly prior to  <dig> hrs post inoculation. this is indicated by hybridization ratios lower than  <dig> x   which reflect a decrease in transcript accumulation due to the response to the avirulent pathogen. interestingly, f3'h transcripts appeared to accumulate significantly by  <dig> hrs after inoculation according to the microarray data. rna blots, to be presented later, confirm the observation that f3'h transcripts accumulate much later during the hr response.

the benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase  gene is predicted to exist in plants such as tobacco, cucumber and potato and encode an enzyme that leads to the synthesis of salicylic acid  from benzoic acid   <cit> . however, a ba2h gene has yet to be identified and cloned from any plant. consequently, no soybean est has been annotated as ba2h and therefore we could not analyze the overall response of this putative gene during pathogen infection. in arabidopsis it has been shown that sa is synthesized in the chloroplast from chorismate by means of isochorismate synthase   <cit> . because only one cdna from this branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway  was present on the arrays used in this study and its expression did not significantly change  during the course of the experiment, we were unable to analyze categorically the transcript profiles of this possible sa branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway.

overall, considerable rapid transcript increases occurred for those genes working in the pathway leading to the synthesis of isoflavones/isoflavanones-phytoalexins. these were followed, with lower transcript ratio increments, by those genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. the f3'h gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of flavones is unique in its response in that it showed a relatively delayed increase in transcript accumulation.

an offshoot of this microarray data analysis was the dual and opposite response for two subsets of ests for many of the pathway members, where one cdna subset showed significant increases in transcript accumulation during the hr while the second subset showed a decrease . in the case of dfr and ccr, the increasing ratios of one of the subsets  and the decreasing ratios of the second subset  are so clearly distinct that it suggests the existence of two genes, perhaps two family members with diverse functionality, subcellular localization, or tissue specific activation/regulation. in three instances  ests from a specific tc  show the reciprocal response setting them apart from the rest of the ests with the same annotations.

single gene transcript analysis of the phenylpropanoid pathway over a 53-hour time course post inoculation
for a more in depth analysis of the transcriptional activity of the soybean pathogen responsive genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, rna blots containing rnas extracted from inoculated plants at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> hrs post inoculation were hybridized with single gene est probes corresponding to cloned, well characterized soybean genes encoding key enzymes of the multiple branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway. an exception to this was the cynnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  gene that has not been cloned or sequenced in soybean but for which there are multiple soybean ests annotated as cad in the genbank and tigr databases. these annotations were based on sequence similarities to cad genes from medicago, arabidopsis, cowpea, oryza sativa and other species, with an end result of multiple soybean cad ests belonging to multiple tentative contigs . a soybean est  was chosen as a putative representative of a soybean cad gene based on the  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity of its tc to a medicago sativa cad ortholog  <cit> .

 <dig>  cynnamylalcohol dehydrogenase 
using the putative cad cdna clone described above as a probe, the relative transcript abundance of this gene and possibly other cad family members was determined in portions of leaf tissue harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs after inoculating plants with psg with or without avrb. to assess the effect of the physical and metabolic stress caused by the infiltration protocol itself on cad induction, a parallel blot with rnas extracted from leaf tissues infiltrated with mgcl <dig> solution devoid of pathogen was probed and used as the base line reference.

the rna blot hybridization results shown in figure  <dig> agree with those obtained in the microarray analysis for a subset of cad cdnas showing higher hybridization ratios at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs post inoculation relative to values of mgcl <dig> infiltrated plants .

 <dig>  chalcone synthase 
a genomic chs cloned fragment ,  <cit>  with homology to all  <dig> chs genes was used in hybridizations to rna blots containing rnas extracted from plants infiltrated with 1) avirulent pathogen , 2) virulent pathogen  and 3) mgcl <dig> control solution. as shown in figure  <dig>  infiltration of leaf tissues with mgcl <dig> alone had very little effect on chs transcript induction. plants infiltrated with the virulent pathogen revealed high levels of chs induction particularly at the  <dig> hr time measurement. however, plants infiltrated with the avirulent psg-avrb displayed much higher levels of hybridization starting as early as  <dig> hrs post inoculation. these results support the involvement of one or more chs genes in the rapid hr mounted by the plant to defend itself from the invading pathogen, as well as a later involvement of chs in efforts to defend against a virulent pathogen.

the hybridization results obtained for this genomic  and other chs cdna clones in the microarray experiments  are in accordance with the rna blot data, showing very high hybridization ratios, in some cases, as high as  <dig> and  <dig> fold at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs post infiltration.

an interesting observation is the lower amounts of chs transcripts detected at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs data points. in those two instances, the leaf tissues from which those rnas were extracted were harvested at 10: <dig> and 10: <dig> pm respectively. eleven pm was the time at which the lights in the growth chamber turned off. this result indicates that towards the end of the diurnal cycle either there was a reduction in the amount of transcripts being synthesized or that certain chs transcripts were targeted for degradation.

a delayed induction of chs genes with transcript accumulation that peaked at about  <dig> hrs after fungal elicitor addition, compared to the more rapid induction of a cad gene showing maximum transcript accumulation at  <dig> hrs, had been observed also in phaseolus vulgaris cell cultures  <cit> . the faster induction of the cad gene seems to be due to a transient stress response to the vacuum infiltration per se as was described earlier . on the other hand, we observed a difference in the sustained high levels of chs transcript accumulation up to  <dig> hrs when compared to what had been observed in alfalfa leaves infected with p. syringae pv. pisi, where the levels of chs transcripts peaked at  <dig> hr and declined rapidly to about 20% of peak value by  <dig> hr post inoculation  <cit> .

 <dig>  isoflavone synthase 
two soybean ifs genes  have been identified, cloned and sequenced  <cit> . the corresponding est clones  from the soybean est collection  <cit>  were chosen to be printed on the soybean cdna microarrays analyzed in this study and to be used as probes for study with the rna blots.

isoflavone synthase is a key enzyme in the synthesis of soybean isoflavones  and the defense inducible phytoalexins such as coumestans and pterocarpans   <cit> . ifs genes are expressed preferentially in the roots and cotyledons of the soybean plants under normal growing conditions . in the cotyledons, the highest level of expression occurs at the time when they transition from the green  to the yellow  stages of late cotyledon development during seed maturation , which precedes the synthesis of isoflavones found when the seeds mature as measured by dhaubhadel et al.  <cit> .

the ifs hybridization results obtained with the rna blots containing rnas from plants infected with the avirulent pathogen  are in agreement with those already described in the microarrays experiment section . the latter results showed hybridization ratios at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs post infiltration much higher than at  <dig> hrs for those cdnas representing both ifs <dig> and ifs <dig> genes.

 <dig>  flavonoid 3' hydroxylase 
the soybean f3'h gene was identified and its expression characterized recently in our laboratory  <cit> . two of several complete cdna clones from the soybean est collection, gm-c1012- <dig> and gm-c1019- <dig>  were chosen to represent the f3'h gene when printing the microarrays and to be used as probes for the rna blot analysis of the response of this gene to pathogen infection.

the f3'h gene was found to be strongly expressed in seed coats at early stages of development and very poorly in all other tissues including the cotyledons  <cit> . the low level of expression of this gene in the mature leaves can be seen also in the rna blots shown in figure  <dig> at the  <dig> data points which represent the status of the leaf tissue prior to infiltration with the pathogen or mgcl <dig> alone. leaves infiltrated with the virulent pathogen showed a slight accumulation of f3'h transcripts compared to those treated with mgcl <dig> alone, but very minimal compared to the larger amounts accumulated by the leaves of plants inoculated with the avirulent pathogen. starting at about 2– <dig> hours f3'h accumulated increasingly to high levels at 36– <dig> hrs post inoculation.

these results suggest that f3'h, an enzyme that adds a hydroxyl group to the 3' position of the b-ring of naringenin and dihydrokaempferol to generate eridictyol and dihydroquercetin respectively, may play a role in the cascade of reactions elicited during defense. flavones and flavonols are secondary metabolites derived from eridictyol and dihydroquercetin by the intervention of flavone synthases  and flavonol synthase  respectively . putative soybean flavanol synthase  ests were printed on the microarrays analyzed in this study but the hybridization ratios  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs after psg-avrb infection are very low and appeared to decrease with time. this decrease may indicate that flavonols have little or no role in defense. if that were the case in soybean the apparent increase in f3'h transcripts upon inoculation may be directed towards increased synthesis of flavones . induction of flavone synthesis has been observed in soybean cell cultures upon osmotic stress, which to some extent mimics the effect of a fungal elicitor  <cit> .

 <dig>  flavanone  <dig> hydroxylase 
differential hybridization to soybean microarrays of flower buds rnas from a pink flower mutant and a purple flower isoline was instrumental in the identification of the wp locus as a flavanone  <dig> hydroxylase gene  <cit> . the two cdna clones that were over expressed in the purple flower, gm-c1012- <dig> and gm-c1019- <dig>  were used as tools in the identification and characterization of two very similar soybean f3h genes . f3h <dig> is expressed strongly in seed coats of wp plants, more weakly in flower buds and shoot tips  but barely detectable expression by rna blots in cotyledons and roots  <cit> . in contrast, the f3h <dig> gene does not seem to be expressed, or very weakly, judging by the lack of hybridization to seed coat or flower bud rnas in the pink flower mutant where a transposon insertion disrupted f3h <dig>  <cit> .

using the gm-c1012- <dig> cdna clone as probe, we determined the transcript profile for the f3h genes during the  <dig> hrs period after infiltration with the avirulent or virulent psg . in contrast to the increase in transcript accumulation with time after infection that we had observed for cad, chs, ifs and f3'h genes, the f3h transcripts decreased very rapidly by the  <dig> hr measurement. more interesting was the fluctuating amounts of these transcripts at different times in the course of the  <dig> hrs after treatment that is clearly reveled by aligning all  <dig> rna blots as shown in figure  <dig>  the f3h transcripts in the psg-avrb infected tissues decreased for a period of  <dig> to  <dig> hrs after infection but at  <dig> hrs there was an increase. this is also the time at which chs and ifs transcripts decreased in abundance. at  <dig> hrs, f3h transcripts decreased again which is the time at which chs and ifs transcripts were most abundant. this pattern repeats itself at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs measurements. clearly, the regulation of the f3h gene expression is different and opposite to that of the chs and ifs genes during the defense response.

further supporting the observation that f3h responds differently than ifs and chs are the results obtained for the rnas extracted from tissues infected with the virulent pathogen . at the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hr time points the amount of transcripts hybridizing is higher than in the corresponding rna samples extracted from plants infected with the avirulent pathogen. a possible explanation for this result is the lesser induction of ifs  and consequently less ifs competing with f3h .

in addition to the down regulation of the f3h gene, the overall abundance of the f3h transcripts was very low. the hybridization intensities from the rna blot shown in figure  <dig> resulted after exposing the autoradiographs for a period of  <dig> days while the autoradiographs of all other blots  were exposed for  <dig> days.

the hybridization ratios for the f3h cdnas printed in the microarray also reflect decrease at  <dig> and  <dig> hours in hr samples similar to that observed in the rna blot . the two f3h cdnas were 'control clones' that had been printed  <dig> times in each array providing  <dig> data points in the microarray analysis.

to synopsize the results of the rna blot hybridizations for the  <dig> gene families , we have shown that cad transcripts accumulated at high levels at an earlier time followed by chs and ifs. with a  <dig> hr delay f3'h transcripts also accumulated, presenting the first demonstration that f3'h may participate in defense. in contrast, f3h transcripts decreased to the lowest levels at the time when the up-regulated genes accumulated transcripts at their peak values  suggesting a down regulation or relegation of this gene/enzyme function to those up-regulated hr responders and consequently predicting a lesser role in the resistant response in soybean. because f3h is an enzyme required for the synthesis of the three classes of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins and at an early step in their synthetic pathway , this flavonoid class most likely does not play a major role in deterring pathogens in soybean. in support of this statement are the results obtained in the microarray hybridization experiments where two f3h downstream genes analyzed, dfr and ldox, also manifested down regulation . these results contrast with the observed up-regulation of four putative anthocyanin biosynthesis related ests in tomato plants responding to psg infection  <cit> .

multiple chs genes are induced in response to pathogen infection
as shown in figure  <dig>  chs transcripts were strongly upregulated. though accumulation of total chs transcripts in response to pathogen attack has been documented not only by us but many others  <cit> , little is known about the gene specific expression profile of the chs family of genes that exist in most legumes, including soybean. our microarray and rna blot analyses have demonstrated that there is a significant and rapid increase in chs transcript accumulation in the incompatible interaction relative to the interaction with the virulent strain, and that chs expression peaks near the  <dig> hour time point post-infiltration. however, the chs probes on the cdna arrays represent long coding regions that will not sufficiently differentiate this highly homologous gene family .

in order to identify which chs gene family member responded to the pathogen, we investigated the transcript levels of each individual gene of the eight member gene family using the gene-specific technique of taqman rt-pcr. we compared the relative profile of the chs gene family in soybean leaves inoculated with the avirulent, psg-avrb strain to those inoculated with mgcl <dig> alone at the  <dig> hrs post infiltration time point . our results indicated that the amount of total chs mrna was considerably higher in soybean leaves inoculated with the psg-avrb, than in those inoculated with the mgcl <dig> alone . these results are consistent with the microarray data in table  <dig>  the chs rna blot  and previous reports on increased total chs expression in soybean leaves infiltrated with an avirulent strain of psg  <cit> . interestingly, leaves infected with the avirulent pathogen accumulated higher and diverse levels of all chs gene transcripts except for chs <dig> . maximal amounts were detected for chs <dig> and chs <dig> in leaves experiencing the incompatible interaction , but expression was greatly increased for all genes except chs <dig> 

discussion
phenylpropanoids  serve a variety of structural and metabolic functions and their induction in response to stress has been studied and documented for a few model plant systems  <cit> . in vivo labeling has demonstrated marked, but transient increases in rates of synthesis of phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes concomitant with the onset of phytoalexin accumulation  <cit> . the transient increases in enzyme synthesis reflected increases in the levels of the corresponding mrna activities  <cit> . in contrast, very little has been concluded regarding gene activities of enzymes of the flavonoid pathway leading to the synthesis of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavones and flavonols in response to pathogen infection.

transcript levels of some of these genes have been examined independently one at a time and more recently in global microarray analysis of arabidopsis, tomato, medicago truncatula and soybean plants responding to bacterial and fungal infections. these studies have provided some hints as to which branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway may be activated during the resistance response in those and other plants  <cit> . based on the up-regulation of a few ests reported from those microarray studies it appears that the lignin/suberin branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway is up-regulated in all the plants examined but that branches downstream of chs  appear not to be induced in arabidopsis  <cit> . in contrast, chs and anthocyanin pathway ests were up-regulated in tomato plants  <cit>  and isoflavonoid ests in medicago truncatula and soybean  <cit> .

in the present study, a combination of two technologies, cdna microarrays and rna gel blot hybridizations, was used to determine the transcript profiles of a set of genes encoding key enzymes involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites derived from several branches of the soybean phenylpropanoid pathway in response to psg infection. all together, the resulting transcript profiles obtained have shown that lignin/suberin biosyntheis appears to be the first response of the pathway in the infected soybean leaves judging by the higher amounts of cad transcripts at  <dig> hrs after psg-avrb inoculation .

immediately following cad was the induction of the isoflavonoid branch of the pathway as reflected by higher accumulation of chs, chr, chi, ifs, iomt, and ifr transcripts  <dig> hrs post inoculation . the induction of the isoflavonoid pathway was further enhanced during the resistance response elicited by the psg-avrb infection as compared to the induction in response to the virulent strain . these results support previous observations enlisting cad, chs and ifs as early responders  <cit> .

a novel finding was the more delayed increase in f3'h transcripts starting at approximately  <dig> hr after infection with psg-avrb  and clearly distinct from the kinetics of transcript accumulation observed upon infection with the virulent psg . based on this finding we could speculate that the flavones branch of the flavonoid pathway also participates in the cascade of reactions elicited during defense, although at a later time relative to the isoflavone/phytoalexin branch of the pathway. f3'h hydroxylates naringenin to eriodictyol a substrate for the synthesis of flavones, flavonols, cyaniding anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins . since transcripts of enzymes leading to the synthesis of flavonols, anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins decreased in abundance in the course of the resistance response, the increase in f3'h transcripts during this same time suggest a potential increase in the synthesis of flavones  and therefore an involvement of these secondary metabolites  <dig> hrs into the defense response. no soybean or any other plant est has been annotated as flavone synthase  <dig> or  <dig>  and it is not currently possible to determine if transcripts from these genes accumulate in the same fashion as f3'h to further support an involvement of flavones in defense.

in contrast, three other flavonoid branches leading to the synthesis of flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins were slowed down judging by the lower amounts of transcripts hybridizing to the f3h, dfr, ldox and fls cdnas as early as  <dig> hrs after infection . the suppression of these branches of the flavonoid pathway seems to be lifted somehow in the soybean plant response to infection with the virulent psg. transcripts of the f3h gene encoding the key enzyme feeding all three branches  accumulated slightly higher amounts in plants infected with psg lacking avr-b . in tomato, microarray data from a one time point  after infection with p. syringae pv. tomato has shown up-regulation of four putative anthocyanin ests but no activation of isoflavonoid ests  <cit> .

even though there have been previous reports describing increases in chs and ifs transcripts in tissues of infected soybean plants, the cyclic nature of the increments, possibly associated with the diurnal cycle, observed in our rna gel blot analysis, had not been documented before . likewise, the increases in f3h transcripts at the times when csh and ifs transcripts decrease in abundance is a novel finding showing that the synthesis of f3h transcripts is opposite correlated to the activity of the ifs genes during the pathogen stress response. this observation allows us to speculate that the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and flavonols is relegated to second place compared to that of the isoflavones/isoflavanones-phytoalexins during the soybean resistance response to psg-avrb infection. we further infer from the data showing that f3h transcript levels are reciprocally correlated to those of chs and ifs, that the entrance into the flavonol/anthocyanin/proanthocyanin branch of the pathway is possibly restricted by the low levels of the f3h and transcripts of genes downstream of f3h, thus giving preference to the isoflavone/phytoalexin branch of the pathway during the response to infection. the critical nature of partitioning the naringenin substrate between f3h and ifs enzymes has been noted previously in that f3h must be non-functional in order to permit accumulation of isoflavones in arabidopsis plants transformed with an ifs gene  <cit> .

induction of a key checkpoint enzyme in the pathway, chs, in response to a pathogen has been reported previously in many plant systems, including soybean  <cit> . however, the relative abundance of the highly homologous eight gene family transcripts of soybean had not been investigated. by using a highly sensitive and gene specific technique, taqman rt-pcr, we have demonstrated that all chs gene family transcripts except one, chs <dig>  accumulated at varying levels in soybean leaves infiltrated with the avirulent strain of psg.

stress metabolite production is often correlated with avirulent responses, but is also observed in response to the virulent pathogen. a variety of experiments have shown that genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, such as pal and chs, are induced to the same extent by virulent and avirulent strains, but that avirulent strains elicit a much more rapid response than virulent strains  <cit> . however, the rna gel blots and cdna microarray analysis on chs expression in soybean leaves infected with psg presented here  and in alfalfa by esnault et. al.  <cit> , have shown that the avirulent strain is significantly more effective at inducing chs than the virulent strain.

the induction of different chs gene family members in glycine max  is in striking contrast to the model species, arabidopsis, where the expression of the single copy chs is marginally affected by inoculation with the virulent or avirulent psg strains  <cit> . arabidopsis lacks isoflavonoids phytoalexins  <cit>  and the fact that chs appears not to be consistently induced upon infection is a strong indication that in arabidopsis the flavonoids  might not play a role in defense. however, there is evidence that a rapid activation of cinnamoyl alcohol dehydrogenase , the branch point enzyme directed towards lignin biosynthesis, occurs in arabidopsis cultivars infected with psg and xanthomonas  <cit> . the accumulation of transcripts encoding enzymes in the lignin branch such as cad seems to be a common rapid response mechanism in all plants examined, including arabidopsis, tomato, medicago truncatula and soybean . thus, increased cad expression may be a common early plant response to pathogens, presumably leading to increased deposition of lignin, suberin and callose into the cell wall to strengthen barriers against further pathogen ingress.

in many plant species, including soybean, key phenylpropanoid pathway genes like chs are encoded by multiple genes exhibiting greater diversity in their 5' and 3' utrs than in the protein coding regions. there has been considerable speculation whether this encoding reflects a means for temporal, spatial or stimulus specific regulation of gene expression, or whether it simply allows for increased enzyme production under stress conditions, when expression of the whole gene family is often superimposed upon tissue specific selective expression of a subset of family members  <cit> . eight hours after infiltration with the avirulent pathogen, we observed significant accumulation of chs transcripts encoded by nearly all the gene family members , which potentially correlates to the different isopeptides being translated. support for this hypothesis comes from earlier work on elicitor-treated soybean cell cultures wherein six chs isomers have been described  <cit> . de novo synthesis of up to nine chs isopeptides has been observed in the elicitor treated bean cell cultures and hypocotyls  <cit> . thus it seems more likely that in soybean, expression of the whole chs gene family is superimposed upon tissue specific selective expression following pathogen infection.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptional analysis of genes from the multiple branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway has shown that in soybean synthesis of lignin/suberin is one of the early responses to pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea infection as deduced by the high accumulation of cad transcripts  <dig> hrs after psg-avrb inoculation. immediately following the cad response was the induction of the isoflavonoid biosynthetic pathway judging by the high accumulation of chs, chr, chi, ifs, iomt, and ifr transcripts  <dig> hrs post inoculation . the data also allowed us to predict that the synthesis of flavones may participate in the r gene-mediated defensive response, as suggested by the higher levels of f3'h transcripts accumulated  <dig> hours post infiltration. in contrast, transcripts of genes involved in the synthesis of flavonols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, also pathogen deterring compounds, seem to be down regulated during the periods of time when the genes involved in the synthesis of isoflavonoids are up-regulated. however, it appears that at times when the activity of ifs genes decrease, synthesis of flavonols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanins may resume based on the concomitant increases of f3h transcripts which encode an enzyme required for biosynthesis of those secondary metabolites. lastly, we conclude that the large transcript increases measured for chs, the gene encoding the central enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, is brought about by the additive up-regulation of seven chs family member genes.
