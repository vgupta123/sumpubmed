BACKGROUND
bile salts are amphipathic, water-soluble end-metabolites of cholesterol that facilitate intestinal absorption of lipids, enhance proteolytic cleavage of dietary proteins, and exert potent antimicrobial activity in the small intestine  <cit> . the synthesis of bile salts is the major route for elimination of cholesterol  from the body  <cit> . bile salts are produced by every class of vertebrate animals and show substantial structural diversity across species  <cit> .

the two basic structural components of bile salts are the 19-carbon  steroid nucleus and a side-chain . in all bile salts characterized to date, the four-ring cyclopentanophenanthrene  nucleus  is fully saturated . the a/b ring juncture is variable, being cis in most bile salts but trans in some species , a shift that greatly influences the overall shape of the steroid nucleus. a/b trans  bile salts have an extended, planar orientation of the steroid rings, while a/b cis  bile salts have a 'bent' orientation of the a ring relative to the other three rings. virtually all bile salts have a hydroxyl group at c- <dig>  and at c- <dig>  because cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile salt biosynthesis  <cit> . additional common sites of hydroxylation are at c- <dig> and c- <dig>  but other sites of hydroxylation have been found, as will be described in our study. hydroxyl groups may also vary in whether they project below  or above  the plane of the steroid nucleus. in some species, hydroxyl groups have undergone dehydrogenation to an oxo group  <cit> .

bile salts that retain all the carbon atoms of cholesterol have a total of  <dig> carbon atoms , possessing an 8-carbon  side-chain on the d-ring in addition to the c <dig> nucleus. in many species, the side-chain is shortened by three carbon atoms, resulting in a c <dig> side-chain and c <dig> bile acids. bile salts with total numbers of carbon atoms other than  <dig> or  <dig> are uncommon but can occur, usually as minor components of bile  <cit> . other than length, further structural variation in the side-chain includes the presence and orientation of hydroxyl groups, the presence of unsaturation in the side-chain, and above all, the substituent on the terminal carbon atom, which is a hydroxyl group in bile alcohols and a carboxyl group in bile acids. side-chain length and the state of oxidation at c- <dig> is used to assign bile salts to three broad classes , and we use this classification throughout this manuscript. primary bile salts are those synthesized by the liver, while secondary bile salts result from extra-hepatic modifications of bile salts, typically by host bacteria in the colon and distal small intestine  <cit> . we use the term 'bile salts' to refer to the broad class of cholesterol end-metabolites .

the evolutionarily 'earliest' bile salts are most likely 5α-bile alcohols that have a trans a/b junction  and retain all  <dig> carbon atoms of cholesterol  <cit> . c <dig> 5α bile alcohols are the dominant bile salts of jawless and lobe-finned fish  <cit> . bile alcohols are esterified with sulfate after their biosynthesis and secreted as the ester sulfate into bile. cholic acid  and chenodeoxycholic acid  are examples of more evolutionarily recent 24-carbon atom  bile acids that have a 'bent' shape because of their cis a/b ring juncture . we propose that bile acids are the derived or apomorphic state for bile salts. bile acids are typically found in bile n-acylamidated  with taurine  or glycine. in prior surveys of bile salts, conjugation of bile acids with taurine was observed to be much more common than with glycine  <cit> .

the details of bile salt biosynthetic pathways are known only in humans and rodents, and have not yet been resolved in other species. the synthetic pathway in humans and rodents using c <dig> 5β bile acids is long and complex, involving up to  <dig> enzymes  and requiring the transport of intermediates between multiple organelles  <cit> . although the details of the bile salt biosynthetic pathways used by non-mammalian species are unknown, animals using exclusively c <dig> bile alcohols likely have simpler and shorter synthetic pathways, as c <dig> bile alcohols do not require side-chain cleavage or oxidation of the terminal alcohol to a carboxylic acid  <cit> .

classification of bile salts into c <dig> bile alcohols, c <dig> bile acids, or c <dig> bile acids places bile salts on a spectrum based on the degree of oxidation  and alteration of the length of the side-chain, which correlates with the number of steps  in the bile salt synthetic pathway . c <dig> bile alcohols require only hydroxylation and reduction of the cholesterol double bond. the minimal or 'stem' c <dig> bile alcohol possesses hydroxyl groups at the 3α, 7α, and  <dig> positions   <cit> . in humans and rodents, the synthesis of a stem c <dig> bile alcohol structure is catalyzed by five enzymes  <cit> . c <dig> bile acids additionally require oxidation of the side-chain to a carboxylic acid group, a step which is accomplished in humans and rodents by the multi-functional enzyme cytochrome p <dig>  27a <dig> that also catalyzes the 25-hydroxylation of 1α-hydroxyvitamin d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> . thus, synthesis of a stem c <dig> bile acid  also only requires five enzymes. c <dig> bile acids require cleavage of the side-chain, a process involving five peroxisomal enzymes in humans and rodents  <cit> , in addition to the other steps that are presumed to be shared with the pathways for c <dig> bile alcohols and c <dig> bile acids.

we greatly extend prior surveys of bile salt diversity in reptiles and mammals. the use of multiple analytical techniques enabled the identification of previously unreported bile salts and detailed resolution of biliary bile salt profiles. in this manuscript, we analyze and discuss the patterns of bile salt structural variation across reptiles and mammals, comparing and contrasting our results with current phylogenies of reptiles and mammals. we also discuss the implications for the evolution of the complex bile salt synthetic pathway, with one of the main goals being to provide background data for future studies of the molecular evolution of bile salt enzymes. lastly, we also present data on analysis of bile salts recovered from human coprolites that are approximately  <dig>  years old as well as from coprolites of the shasta ground sloth , a mammal that was one of  <dig> known genera of large  north american animals that disappeared suddenly at the end of the pleistocene period approximately  <dig>  <dig> years ago  <cit> .

RESULTS
overview of bile salt variation in reptiles and mammals
we analyzed the bile salts in biliary bile from  <dig> reptile species  and  <dig> mammalian species . we grouped bile salts into three broad types , which allowed us to classify each species into one of six categories based on which one or two bile salt types are present at 10% or greater of the biliary bile salt pool  <cit> : class i, c <dig> bile alcohols only; class ii, c <dig> bile alcohols + c <dig> bile acids; class iii, c <dig> bile alcohols + c <dig> bile acids; class iv, c <dig> bile acids only; class v, c <dig> bile acids + c <dig> bile acids; and class vi, c <dig> bile acids only. this classification makes no assumptions about the effectiveness or physiological functions of bile salts.

the bile salt profiles of all species analyzed are in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> , with the bile salt class indicated for each species. unusual bile salt profiles are summarized in table  <dig>  as noted in prior surveys of vertebrate bile salts  <cit> , bile salt profiles tend to be conserved within families and even within orders of animals, especially for reptiles and mammals. there were only three reptile families  and only one mammalian family  that showed different bile salt classes between species within a family, but even in these cases, there was always overlap of bile salts within all species of the family .

bile salts of reptiles
the bile salts of all reptiles analyzed are summarized in additional file  <dig>  two orders of reptiles - crocodylia and testudines - showed little variation of bile salt profiles across species. although species within crocodylia and testudines often have biliary bile salt mixtures that are complex and difficult to resolve analytically  <cit> , each order is characterized by a single dominant bile salt . crocodylian species share the phenotype of using a c <dig> bile acid with a hydroxylation pattern  common to many bile salts. this c <dig> bile acid  can be thought of as analogous to ca, the most common c <dig> bile acid. turtles and tortoises, on the other hand, have c <dig> bile acids with an additional 22-hydroxylation relative to 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oic acid, a modification to c <dig> bile acids that is so far unique to testudines. turtles from the family emydidae also had a portion of their c <dig> bile acids containing both 15α- and 22s-hydroxylation. testudines also had the only two reptile species in our survey  that had c <dig> bile alcohols  present at more than 10% of total biliary bile salts.

the phylogeny of squamata  is still under active debate and study. with the rise of molecular-based phylogenetic studies, the traditional position of many taxa based on morphology and paleontology has been challenged  <cit> . to provide an evolutionary framework, we map the bile salt profiles of squamata orders onto a tree that represents the summary of current knowledge on squamata phylogeny, incorporating the species analyzed in our study .

our survey of squamata covered species from five groups derived from molecular phylogenetic analyses   <cit> . all species examined within three families  of iguania had c <dig> 5α-bile acids  as the primary bile salt . 5α bile acids, also known as 'allo' bile acids, are generally uncommon in vertebrates, being very rare in mammals, fish, and amphibians  <cit> . other than iguanian lizards, the only other vertebrates that commonly use 5α bile acids are waterfowl  <cit> . some of the iguanian species had a minor fraction of 5β bile acids . outside iguania, the only other reptiles in our sample to predominantly use 5α bile acids were warren's girdle-tail  and the tokay gecko . 5α bile acids were not found at greater than 5% of total biliary bile salts in any other reptile species examined.

all species examined within anguimorpha  had a 5β c <dig> bile acid known as varanic acid  as the primary bile salt , a structure also found in the tuatara . the expression of this structure in bile as a major primary bile salt is unique to reptiles, but varanic acid is also synthesized  in the longer human bile acid synthetic pathway  <cit> . the species examined with the groups laterata  and gekkota had ca as their dominant bile salt. we also examined three species within the group scinciformata. two skinks in the family scincidae - pygmy spiny-tailed skink  and blotched blue-tailed skink  - had 24r-hydroxylated c <dig> bile acids as their major bile acids including varanic acid and 3α,7α,24r-trihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oic acid .

of the  <dig> species of snakes examined, the most common major bile salt was the c <dig> bile acid ca . within the family viperidae, we examined the bile of  <dig> species, belonging to two subfamilies, the viperines  and the crotalines   <cit> . the viperine clade that includes the genera bitis, cerastes, daboia, eristicophis, and macrovipera, was notable in having the 7-dehydroxylated bile acid known as bitocholic acid  as well as c <dig> bile acids in their biliary bile salts. in contrast, the crotaline clade that includes the genera agkistrodon, azemiops, bothriechis, bothrops, crotalus, deinagkistrodon, lachesis, trimeresurus, and tropidolaemus had bile salt profiles consistently of approximately 100% ca. the phylogenetically most basal snake families examined in our survey  were notable in that all species shared the 7-deoxy bile acid known as pythocholic acid  as a major primary bile acid. both bitocholic and pythocholic acids are unusual, since in humans and rodents  7-hydroxyation of cholesterol is the first and rate-limiting step of bile acid biosynthesis  <cit> . the mechanism by which these 7-dehydroxylated bile acids are produced in snakes is currently unknown, although it has been suggested that pythocholic acid is formed by 16α-hydroxylation of the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid   <cit> . this mechanism is physiologically plausible  if snakes that feed infrequently shut off new bile acid synthesis between meals and thus have an abundance of 7-deoxy bile acids in their bile, as a result of intestinal bacteria removing the 7-hydroxy group from the original primary bile acids  <cit> . 7-deoxy bile acids have not been identified as primary bile acids in any other species  <cit> .

bile salts of mammals
we examined the biliary bile salts of  <dig> mammals, of which  <dig> had type vi bile salt profiles  . we have mapped the bile salt profiles of mammals onto a molecular phylogenetic tree  <cit> , incorporating the species analyzed in our study . only one mammal analyzed  had > 50% 5α bile acids; for most mammals, 5α bile acids were found only at trace levels. perhaps the most striking finding was that all five species of paenungulates examined  had c <dig> bile alcohols as their primary bile salts   <cit> . the bile alcohols of paenungulates utilize 25-hydroxylation, a rare substitution in c <dig> bile salts that is also found in the bile alcohols of lobe-finned fish   <cit> . in contrast to the paenungulates, the bile salts of the south african aardvark  and rufous sengi , two animals also grouped by molecular phylogenetic analyses with paenungulates in the cohort afrotheria  <cit> , were typical c <dig> bile acids consisting mainly of ca.

the biliary bile salts of  <dig> species of monotremes  were both composed of greater than 95% c <dig> bile acids. the bile of both monotremes analyzed did, however, contain c <dig> bile acids at about 2% of total bile salts; the c <dig> bile acid present was 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oic acid, the dominant bile salt of crocodylians  and also a primary bile salt of ratite birds . we examined  <dig> species of marsupials, which revealed uncommon bile acids relative to placental mammals and other vertebrates: 1α-hydroxy-cdca  in the spotted cuscus , 1β-hydroxy-cdca  in the feather-tailed glider , 3α-hydroxy-7-oxo-5β-cholan-24-oic acid in the queensland koala , 7-oxo-dca  in both the kowari  and spotted-tailed quoll , and 15α-hydroxy bile acids in the common wombat   <cit> . some of these substitutions have also been described in birds, e.g., 1β-bile acids in the tinamou  <cit> , fruit pigeons, and doves  <cit> ; and 15α-hydroxy bile acids in swans, ducks, and geese  <cit> .

in placental mammals, the common occurrence of the c <dig> bile acids ca and cdca limits the phylogenetic information of bile salt variation. however, there are groups of mammals which share less common bile salts. one example is in the pinnipeds, a diverse group of semi-aquatic marine mammals that include the families odobenidae , otariidae , and phocidae . all were found to have 23r-tri- and tetrahydroxy bile acids as their major bile salts. we did not detect 23r-hydroxylated bile acids in any other mammals in our survey, including  <dig> species within mustelidae, currently proposed as the sister taxa to pinnipeds  <cit> , consistent with other studies suggesting that living pinnipeds comprise a monophyletic group within carnivora  <cit> .

ursidae are another example of a family sharing an uncommon bile acid. six of eight species within ursidae had ursodeoxcholic acid  as a primary bile acid constituting more than 6% of the total biliary bile salts. ursodeoxycholic acid is unusual in that the orientation of 7-hydroxyl group is 7β, as opposed to the 7α orientation common to most bile salts  <cit> . outside ursidae, ursodeoxycholic acid was not detected at greater than 5% of total biliary bile salts in any other species within carnivora. the only other mammals in our survey to have more than trace amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid were several rodents, including the north american beaver  and three caviomorph species within two families  . recently published work by other investigators have identified two additional novel bile acids in the asian black bear : 3α, <dig> α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid and 3α,7α,9α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid  <cit> .

hydroxylation at c- <dig> was also uncommon in mammals, being found only in suidae , the lesser malay chevrotain , and muridae. the chevrotain and mammals within suidae share the trait of having hyocholic acid , a 6α-hydroxylated bile acid, as their primary bile salt. bile salts of muridae use 6β-hydroxylated bile acids .

relationship of diet to bile salt profile
to examine how diet might be related to bile salt profile, we divided mammals and reptiles into carnivores , herbivores , or omnivores  . in our mammalian sample, there were  <dig> carnivores,  <dig> herbivores, and  <dig> omnivores. there were no clear differences between the different dietary groups in terms of percentage of animals that have ca as the major bile salt, cdca as the major bile salt, or a c <dig> bile acid other than ca or cdca as the major bile salt . we also classified bile salt profiles as 'complex' or 'non-complex', with complex being defined as having a bile salt profile that includes two bile salt classes  and/or the presence of three or more bile salts in bile, with each comprising 10% of greater of total biliary bile salts. using this classification,  <dig> % of carnivores,  <dig> % of herbivores, and  <dig> % of omnivores in our mammal sample had complex bile salt profiles.

in reptiles, the majority of animals analyzed were carnivores , with fewer herbivores  and omnivores . in this sample, the majority of herbivores  and omnivores  use primarily c <dig> bile acids, a bile salt profile less common in carnivores , but the herbivores and omnivores are mainly found in species from testudines . using the classification of bile salt profile complexity defined in the above paragraph, there were few reptiles with complex bile salt profiles:  <dig> % of carnivores,  <dig> % of herbivores, and  <dig> % of omnivores.

evolutionary variation of bile salts across reptiles, birds, and mammals
for lizards/snakes/tuatara , 24r-hydroxylation of c <dig> bile acids is a trait shared by some lizards  and the tuatara. there have been a number of innovations in bile salt synthesis in snakes relative to other reptiles including 23r-hydroxylation, 7-dehydroxylation, 16α-hydroxylation, and production of c <dig> bile acids. it should be noted that a 24r-hydroxy c <dig> bile acid would lose the 24r-hydroxyl group upon side-chain shortening and oxidation to a c <dig> bile acid, so it is likely that 24r-hydroxylated c <dig> bile acids are produced as intermediates in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways of lizards and snakes that have primary bile salt profiles consisting of approximately 100% c <dig> bile acids.

analysis of human and extinct ground sloth coprolites
to determine whether bile salts could be recovered from paleontological specimens older than  <dig>  <dig> years, we analyzed coprolite samples from ancient humans and the extinct shasta ground sloth nothrotherium shastense. the human coprolite samples had been collected from the danger cave archaeological site, utah, usa, and dated as approximately  <dig>  years old by radiocarbon analysis . bile acids were readily recovered from the human coprolite samples including the primary bile acid ca as well as the secondary bile acids lithocholic acid , 12-oxo-lca , dca, and 7-oxo-dca  , a profile similar to bile acids in human cecal contents obtained from autopsy specimens  <cit> .

the shasta ground sloth coprolite was collected from rampart cave in arizona . the bile acid concentrations in the shasta ground sloth coprolite samples were lower than the human coprolite specimen. to enable sensitivity at the low concentrations of bile acids present, the samples were analyzed by esi/ms/ms. this analysis revealed peaks with m/z ratios consistent with the presence of glycine-conjugated mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-hydroxylated c <dig> bile acids, along with additional peaks with m/z ratios missing two or four protons, consistent with either conversion of hydroxyl groups into oxo groups, or the presence of singly- and doubly-unsaturated c <dig> bile acids, or a mixture of both . taurine-conjugated bile acids were not detected. a complex mixture of plant sterols and stanols were also present, consistent with an herbivorous diet. . our samples of living mammals included two sloth species: bradypus tridactylus  and bradypus variegatus . both sloth species had ~100% glycine-conjugated bile acids in their bile, including the unusual bile acid 7-oxo-dca . we also analyzed the fecal bile salts from hoffmann's two-toed sloth . the fecal bile salts from this sloth showed a mixture of glycine-conjugated and unconjugated bile acids, similar to the ground sloth coprolites. in our mammalian biliary bile survey, only  <dig> of  <dig> species surveyed had ~100% glycine conjugation of bile acids, supporting the conclusion that the bile acids identified are indeed from a sloth.

comparison of bile salt enzymes across species
as discussed in the introduction, there are at least  <dig> enzymes involved in bile salt synthetic pathways in humans and rodents, with two main pathways  identified so far  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a simplified version of the neutral bile salt synthetic pathway. the minimal synthetic pathway for a functional bile salt would involve five enzymes in the production of a stem c <dig> bile alcohol with three hydroxyl groups, a bile salt actually found in a small number of animals surveyed so far  .

the first enzyme is cytochrome p <dig>  7a <dig> which converts cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol. the next enzyme in the neutral enzyme, 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ5-c <dig> steroid oxidoreductase , catalyzes the simultaneous isomerization of the c- <dig> - c- <dig> double bond to c- <dig> - c- <dig> and oxidation of the 3β hydroxyl group to a 3-oxo group. the third enzyme, aldo-keto reductase 1d <dig> , mediates stereospecific reduction of the Δ <dig> double bond to form a 5β  steroid. the fourth enzyme, akr1c <dig>  reduces the 3-oxo group to a 3α-hydroxy group  <cit> . the fifth and final enzyme is the mitochondrial c- <dig> hydroxylase  that results in the formation of a c <dig> bile alcohol. the multi-functional cyp27a <dig> also has the ability to catalyze the conversion of a c <dig> bile alcohol to a c <dig> bile acid by oxidation of the hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon atom of the side-chain to a carboxylic acid group. these five enzymes  dictate three key properties of bile salts:  orientation of the c- <dig> hydroxyl group ,  orientation of the hydrogen atom at c- <dig> , which influences the overall configuration  of the steroid rings, and  synthesis of c <dig> bile alcohol versus further oxidation to c <dig> bile acid. the remaining  <dig> enzymes identified so far in the bile salt synthetic pathway catalyze a number of reactions including additional hydroxylation , side-chain shortening and oxidation , or alternative reactions such as found in the acidic pathway of bile acid synthesis  <cit> .

we utilized blast searches to try to identify putative orthologs of the human enzymes involved in bile salt biosynthesis  <cit> . while assignment of true orthology depends on both sequence comparison and biochemical verification, tentative orthology can be assigned by reciprocal blast searching. caution needs to be especially applied to comparisons of enzymes that are part of large superfamilies . indeed, we were not able to clearly identify putative orthologs in non-mammalian species to the gene for human akr1c <dig> 

currently, of all the ongoing vertebrate genome sequencing projects, there are many mammalian species but only one reptile, the green anole lizard . the green anole lizard is of interest with respect to bile salt variation in that this species has nearly 100% 5α  bile acids. indeed, of the  <dig> species within iguanidae analyzed, most had greater than 85% 5α bile acids and all had at least 50% 5α bile acids . the unusual bile salt profile of the anole lizard thus raises the question of how this animal synthesizes a bile salt pool of mainly 5α bile acids. of the model mammalian species in genome sequencing projects, two are paenungulates  that have bile salt profiles consisting of nearly 100% bile alcohols, a phenotype also found in jawless fish, cartilaginous fish, lobe-finned fish, and some amphibians, but not yet observed in any reptile or bird species. the elephant and rock hyrax can serve as examples to address how an animal maintains a bile salt pool of c <dig> bile alcohols without producing detectable amounts of bile acids.

focusing on akr1d <dig>  the enzyme that catalyzes 5β-reduction of the steroid nucleus, we found that putative orthologs to the human enzyme could be found in mammals, birds, green anole lizard, xenopus frogs, and multiple teleost fish . interestingly, an akr1d <dig> ortholog could not be located for zebrafish  <cit> , the only model teleost fish for genome sequencing studies that exclusively produces 5α bile salts. in contrast, an akr1d <dig> ortholog was readily identified for the anole lizard, with an amino acid sequence identity of  <dig> % to human akr1d <dig>  similar to the sequence identity of  <dig> % between human and chicken akr1d <dig>  although an akr1d <dig> ortholog could not be detected in the zebrafish genome, we did find putative zebrafish orthologs to the mammalian genes for 5α-reductase  <dig>  and  <dig> : genbank: nm_ <dig> and genbank: nm_ <dig>  respectively.

focusing next on cyp27a <dig>  the enzyme that in some species catalyzes 27-hydroxyation of bile salt intermediates to form c <dig> bile alcohols and in other species, continues the oxidation of the side-chain to form c <dig> bile acids, we found putative orthologs to the human enzyme throughout vertebrates, including african elephant, rock hyrax, anole lizard, and zebrafish. the elephant, hyrax, and zebrafish all have bile salt profiles consisting of c <dig> bile alcohols and thus would be predicted to have cyp27a <dig> enzymes unable to further catalyze the oxidation of the side-chain from a c <dig> bile alcohol to c <dig> bile acid. as mentioned above, the anole lizard and zebrafish synthesize 5α bile salts; consequently, cyp27a <dig> enzymes in these species would need to accommodate bile salt precursors with 5α orientation.

we also identified putative orthologs in many species, including african elephant and zebrafish, to the four peroxisomal enzymes  involved in shortening of the side-chain to produce c <dig> bile acids. in fact, candidates for orthologs to all four peroxisomal enzymes were identified in the genome of the zebrafish, an animal that does not shorten the side-chain of its bile salts . this is not necessarily surprising in that these enzymes also fulfil other cellular functions such as β-oxidation of fatty acids  <cit> . however, it does raise the question of how animals that produce only c <dig> bile salts  retain the c <dig> side-chain of cholesterol.

lastly, for four of the bile salt synthetic enzymes , we identified putative orthologs in the genomes of model invertebrates such sea squirt , pacific sea squirt , and purple sea urchin . invertebrates are not known to produce bile salts, so these enzymes likely serve other functions. these enzymes are thus candidates for the study of how protein functions changed during the evolution of invertebrates to vertebrates.

discussion
we have greatly expanded previous surveys of bile salt structural diversity in reptiles and mammals. the variation of bile salts is consistent with current molecular-based phylogenies of reptiles and mammals, including the recent reclassification of squamate groups based on dna sequencing data and studies showing that pinnipeds form a monophyletic group with carnivora  <cit> . perhaps the most unusual finding in our study was that the paenungulates  have a very different bile salt profile from the rufous sengi and south american aardvark, two other mammals classified with paenungulates in the cohort afrotheria by molecular phylogenetic analysis. it will be of interest to determine the molecular basis for these differences. as we discuss below, this finding could be accounted for by differences in a single enzyme, cyp27a <dig> 

our analysis did not reveal any obvious relationship between diet and bile salt profiles, although a major caveat to this analysis is the non-random nature of the animals found in our survey of reptiles and mammals. in reptiles, the analysis is further limited by the preponderance of carnivores in the surveyed sample , with far fewer herbivores or omnivores. we also did not find any evidence that bile salt complexity is associated with a more complex omnivorous diet in either mammals or reptiles. the lack of association of bile salt profile and diet is also suggested by groups of animals that have very similar bile salt profiles but different diets. examples include primates, ursidae , other animals in carnivora excluding pinnipeds, and testudines. overall, common bile acids such as ca and cdca, or other c <dig> bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid, are found in species with varied diets. with uncommon bile acids, there is insufficient data to make generalizations. for example, pythocholic acid  or varanic acid  could theoretically be advantageous to a carnivorous diet, pending more extensive surveys of reptiles and mammals.

our analysis of ancient human and extinct giant ground sloth coprolites demonstrates the stability of bile acids in biological specimens preserved in arid climates. previous studies have analyzed bile acids and sterols from human coprolites or internal organs preserved within mummies, with ages ranging from approximately  <dig> to  <dig>  years old  <cit> . our results suggest that bile salts may be useful markers in select paleontological studies.

our use of multiple analytical techniques  allowed us to precisely resolve complicated bile salt profiles. we speculate on what these findings mean for the understanding of the evolution of bile salt synthesis, a complex and key biochemical pathway that permits cholesterol excretion to be regulated and at the same time generates amphipathic molecules with multiple physiological functions. in analyzing the patterns of bile salt variation across vertebrates, there appears to be at least two major pathways in the evolutionary transition from c <dig> bile alcohols  to c <dig> bile acids :  a 'direct' pathway and  an 'indirect' pathway that uses c <dig> bile acids as an 'intermediate' step. evidence to support pathway  comes mainly from teleost fish families  where either type iii  or type vi  are found, but not fish with any appreciable amount of c <dig> bile acids  <cit> . this suggests that the ancestors of these fish followed an evolutionary transition from c <dig> bile alcohols directly to c <dig> bile acids. this differs from reptiles , some mammals, and amphibians, where c <dig> bile acids are common  <cit> .

one of the major goals of our study is to provide testable hypotheses for determining what bile salt enzyme differences underlie cross-species differences in bile salt profiles. cross-species comparisons have already yielded some insights into different in bile salt profiles. an example is the discovery in pigs of cyp4a <dig>  an enzyme that catalyzes 6α-hydroxylation of bile acids  <cit> , a bile acid modification not found in humans. one unanswered question is how a bile salt synthetic pathway 'stops' at c <dig> bile alcohols, as must occur in animals such as paenungulates, rhinoceroses, and zebrafish whose bile salt profiles do not show c <dig> or c <dig> bile acids. one possible explanation would involve the multi-functional capabilities of cyp27a <dig>  animals synthesizing only c <dig> bile alcohols would have cyp27a <dig> enzymes that can 27-hydroxylate but not oxidize the side-chain of the resulting c <dig> bile alcohols. it would be of interest to test the substrate specificities of cyp27a <dig> from species that synthesize mainly bile alcohols. no high-resolution crystal structure of cyp27a <dig> is currently available, but a homology model of human cyp27a <dig> has been developed  <cit>  which could be used for comparative purposes to rationalize cross-species differences in substrate and catalytic specificity.

there is the additional question of when did the fatty acid and bile salt β-oxidation enzymes develop in peroxisomes. three of these enzymes have strong candidates for invertebrate orthologs, suggesting a long evolutionary history, but the parallel ability for bile salt β-oxidation must have been a strictly vertebrate innovation given the occurrence of bile salts only in vertebrates. the zebrafish is an example of an animal that produces only c <dig> bile salts, yet possesses putative orthologs to genes for all four peroxisomal enzymes involved in shortening of the bile acid side-chain in mammals  <cit> . evolutionary changes of peroxisomal transporters such as atp-binding cassette transporter d <dig>   <cit>  may have been important in this regard by facilitating substrate entry into the peroxisomes , possibly explaining how an animal can maintain a bile salt profile of mainly c <dig> bile acids while having all the enzymes capable of c <dig> bile salt side-chain cleavage to form a c <dig> bile acid. there have been limited studies of peroxisomes in non-mammalian species, and we are not aware of any published studies of this organelle in reptiles. detailed studies of peroxisomes in reptile groups that produce only c <dig> bile acids  could be especially helpful in understanding cross-species differences in bile salt biosynthesis, particularly modification of the side-chain.

genomic comparisons may also provide some potential insight into the synthesis of 5α-bile salts. the sporadic appearance of 5α-bile salts in otherwise evolutionarily recent animals suggests that it is the result of mutation in a biosynthetic enzyme . trace levels of 5α-bile acids are ubiquitous in bile, but the origins of these small concentrations are likely produced by microbial flora and not from biosynthesis  <cit> . the presence of 5α-bile acids in the bile of germ-free rabbits indicates that at least some mammals are capable of synthesizing 5α-bile acids  <cit> . the hepatic enzymes  that perform 5α-reduction of bile salt intermediates like 4-cholesten-7α,12α-diol-3-one are as yet uncharacterized  <cit> .

model animals such as the anole lizard and zebrafish may be helpful in determining the enzymatic pathways for generating 5α bile salts. for example, we did not find a putative ortholog to the gene for akr1d <dig> in the zebrafish genome. we did, however, find likely orthologs to the mammalian genes for 5α-reductase  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the zebrafish genome. it is possible that either or both of these enzymes, or another enzyme altogether, catalyzes 5α-reduction of the steroid nucleus in zebrafish bile salt biosynthesis. in contrast, a putative ortholog for akr1d <dig> was identified in the genome of the anole lizard. studies of anole lizard akr1d <dig> are required to see if this enzyme catalyzes 5α-reduction of bile acid intermediates  or 5β-reduction for the trace amounts 5β-bile acids present in anole bile. there are also ongoing sequencing projects for sea lamprey  and coelacanth , two animals that exclusively produce 5α bile alcohols  <cit> . comparison of the genomes of anole lizard, zebrafish, lamprey, and coelacanth may also provide insight into how they achieve a bile salt pool of 5α-bile salts. additional file  <dig> includes a summary of model animals whose study may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying cross-species differences in bile salt profiles.

our study does not shed light on how animals regulate their bile salt profiles. in additional file  <dig> we include some spectra focusing on the minor bile salts of various species revealing there can be a complex mixture of bile alcohols at low concentration even in species whose biliary bile salts are comprised of greater than 95% bile acids. whether these minor bile salts perform physiological functions or are simply vestigial is currently unknown. it is logical to assume to that both bile acid biosynthesis and intestinal conservation are mainly controlled by transcriptional regulators, although this is not well-understood even in mammals.

there is still little understanding of what drives variation in bile salt chemical diversity. as our analysis of reptiles and mammals shows, there is essentially no apparent link between diet and bile salt structure. typical 5β-c <dig> bile acids are found in reptiles and mammals with a wide variety of diets. it should be noted that all described hydroxylation sites occur on the hydrophilic face of the bile salt molecule, keeping the amphipathicity intact  <cit> . it is also unclear what benefit may be conferred to those reptiles  that use 5α bile salts. studies in mammals have shown that 5α bile acids can be toxic. one striking example of this occurs in the rabbit. rabbits fed 5α-cholestanol  form 5α-cholic acid, which is 7-dehydroxylated by gut bacteria to form 5α-deoxycholic acid and subsequently conjugated with glycine in the liver. however, the glycine conjugate of 5α-deoxycholic acid acid precipitates from solution in the gallbladder, forming gallstones  <cit> . animals with a bile salt pool of mostly 5α-bile acids evidently have mechanisms to avoid toxicity.

the bile salt biosynthetic pathway has apparently evolved in vertebrates in a considerably different fashion from the adrenocortical and sex steroid hormones, another set of compounds derived from cholesterol. estrogens are the terminal products of the steroid hormone pathway whereas other steroids such as glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoids are intermediates. the actions of the steroid hormones are mediated by nuclear hormone receptors. thornton and colleagues have used a variety of techniques, including phylogenetic reconstruction and expression of ancestral proteins, to provide evidence that estrogen receptors have a longer evolutionary history than receptors for intermediate products  in the steroid hormone pathways  <cit>  . in the 'molecular exploitation' model of a biochemical pathway, the terminal products of a synthetic pathway mediate the more ancestral activities. during evolution, functions  develop for the intermediate products of the pathway, and structural diversity involving intermediates in the pathway can increase over time. in the case of the steroid hormones, the major evolutionary changes probably occurred in early vertebrate evolution or even earlier.

the diversity of bile salts, starting in fish and amphibians  <cit>  and combined with the data for reptiles and mammals in the present study, suggests a different model of evolution of bile salts from steroid hormones. in the case of bile salts, the terminal products are increasing in diversity throughout all vertebrate classes. a parallel to the bile salt synthetic pathway may be found in the enzymatic pathways involved in the formation of triterpenoids, isoprene-derived 30-carbon molecules that serve as a building block for many other compounds. studies of bacteria, plants, and animals demonstrate at least two independent pathways for the formation of isoprene units, each involving multiple organelles  <cit> . similar to bile salts, the synthetic intermediates in the triterpinoid pathways are low in diversity but the end-products have impressive biochemical diversity and mediate an array of different physiological functions. like triterpinoids, the end-products of bile salt synthesis have substantial structural diversity by variations in hydroxylation patterns, unsaturation, and side-chain length. snakes and marsupials are two groups that demonstrate ongoing 'innovations' in bile acids not seen in fish and amphibians .

bile acid synthesis is now known to be catalyzed in humans and rodents by at least two independent pathways , with tight regulation keeping intermediate products at very low concentrations in the hepatocytes and biliary bile  <cit> . in some animals such as the crotaline snakes, the result is a bile salt pool consistently of almost 100% of a single bile salt molecule such as ca. the bile salt synthetic pathway has evolved from a relatively simple pathway that produces c <dig> bile alcohols   <cit>  to more complex pathways that utilize multiple organelles  to produce c <dig> bile acids. in the process, many ray-finned fish and most land animals have bile containing almost exclusively c <dig> bile acids and very low amounts of the synthetic precursors including c <dig> bile alcohols, a process achieved by the evolution of regulatory control and enzyme modifications.

although there is extensive data on the physicochemical and physiological properties of common bile acids such as ca and cdca , there has been much less study of other classes of bile salts. in part, this relates to the difficulty of synthesizing or isolating sufficient material to perform detailed studies. the complicated variation of bile salts may also relate to other functions of bile salts that are not well understood, including communication, influencing of the microbial environment in the gut, and regulation of hepatobiliary development and regeneration  <cit> . it has been proposed that bile acid structural variation may be driven by attempts to prevent gut microbial 'damage' of bile acids that can lead to toxic secondary bile acids such as dca and lca  <cit> . novel modifications to the stem bile salt structures throughout vertebrate evolution make it difficult for bacteria to alter the bile salt structure into molecules that are toxic or have poor aqueous solubility or both.

finally, the extensive variation of bile salt structures across vertebrate species predicts that protein receptors that bind bile salts will also show variation in structure and ligand-binding specificity. indeed, research has already shown distinct patterns of ligand-receptor co-evolution for three nuclear hormone receptors  that regulate various aspects of bile salt synthesis, transport, or metabolism  <cit> . model species that have bile salt profiles different from humans, such as anole lizard, rock hyrax, and african elephant, may be particularly interesting to study, as their bile salt-regulating nuclear hormone receptors would have to bind different ligands  than their human or rodent orthologs which need to recognize c <dig> 5β-bile acids. ultimately, we aim to build up a complete multi-dimensional picture of ligand, protein, commensal microbial, and species evolution involving bile salts.

CONCLUSIONS
bile salts are a biochemical product of varying structures that tend to be conserved within families or orders of vertebrates. variations in bile salts do not correlate with diet. analysis of the evolution of bile salt synthetic pathways provides a rich model system for the evolution of a complex biochemical pathway in vertebrates. our results also demonstrate the stability of bile salts in coprolites preserved in arid climates suggesting that bile salt analysis may have utility in selected paleontological research.
