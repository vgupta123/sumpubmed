BACKGROUND
taste disorders, including taste loss and taste distortion, can substantially decrease quality of life and contribute to depression, anorexia and malnutrition  <cit> . while etiological studies have suggested the association of a range of conditions and diseases with taste impairment, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of taste disorders remain largely unknown  <cit> .

several lines of evidence suggest that inflammation contributes to the development of taste disorders. first, inflammation, an immune response to infection, tissue damage, autoimmunity, and stress, is a common condition in a number of diseases associated with taste disorders, including upper respiratory infections, oral cavity infections, human immunodeficiency virus infection, autoimmune systemic lupus disease, sjögren's disease, and cancer  <cit> . second, multiple inflammation-related molecules, such as the toll-like receptors , the interferon  receptors, several chemokines, and cytokines, are expressed at higher levels in taste bud cells than in nontaste lingual epithelial cells  <cit> . third, some inflammatory cytokines, such as ifns, can alter gene expression and induce cell death in taste buds  <cit> . however, the effects of inflammation on taste bud structure and function have not been well characterized.

mammalian taste buds, distributed on the surface of the oral cavity, harbour 50- <dig> cells, including taste receptor cells, supporting cells, and immature basal cells  <cit> . taste receptor cells express the molecular machinery for detecting taste compounds and transmitting the signals, either directly and/or indirectly via other taste bud cells, to the peripheral gustatory nerves that innervate the taste buds  <cit> . during taste cell turnover, aged taste receptor cells degenerate and are replaced by new receptor cells differentiated from the basal cells. although the average life span of taste cells is approximately  <dig> days  <cit> , recent studies suggest that some taste cells can last more than  <dig> weeks in the buds  <cit> . several cell death-related proteins, including the tumor suppressor protein p <dig>  bax , and caspases, are expressed in the taste buds  <cit> . however, it is unclear what mechanism initiates the cell death pathways and, therefore, determines the life span of taste cells.

to maintain structural stability and cell type equilibrium, taste progenitor cells give rise to newborn cells, which enter taste buds and differentiate into different types of mature taste bud cells. little is known about the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation, immature cell differentiation, and taste cell degeneration. some experimental manipulations can perturb these steps of taste bud turnover and disrupt the structural homeostasis. for instance, denervation of peripheral gustatory nerves induces extensive taste cell degeneration by apoptosis, which leads to the disappearance of taste buds  <cit> . on the other hand, dietary sodium restriction during pre- and postnatal development increases the latency for newborn cells to enter taste buds as well as taste cell life span and turnover periods  <cit> . the effect of inflammation on taste progenitor cell proliferation and taste bud cell turnover, however, has not yet been reported.

inflammation mediated by tlr signalling promotes neurodegeneration and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . in addition, inflammatory stimuli  and proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor -α and interleukin - <dig>  affect brain neurogenesis by modulating neural progenitor cell proliferation, newborn cell survival, and neural differentiation  <cit> . taste sensory cells are epithelial cells with neuronal properties  <cit> . taste progenitor cells and basal cells express genes such as sox <dig> and mash <dig> that are also involved in cell-fate determination and differentiation in the nervous system, suggesting that taste bud cells may share cell renewal mechanisms with neurons  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the effect of inflammation on taste progenitor cell proliferation and taste cell turnover using the lps-induced acute inflammation model. our results show that lps strongly suppresses the expression of cyclin b <dig> and e2f <dig>  two critical cell cycle regulators, in circumvallate and foliate epithelia. accordingly, lps markedly attenuates taste progenitor cell proliferation as shown by brdu-labeling experiments and ki <dig> immunostaining. furthermore, lps-induced inflammation curtails the average life span of taste bud cells.

RESULTS
lps stimulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in taste tissues
intraperitoneal injection of lps, a gram-negative bacterial cell wall component, induces systemic inflammation characterized by the production of a spectrum of cytokines  <cit> . to investigate whether lps injection can induce an inflammatory response in taste tissues, we examined the expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including tnf-α, ifn-γ, il-1β, il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein - <dig>  in circumvallate and foliate papillae. quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  analysis showed that  <dig> h after intraperitoneal lps injection, the expression levels of tnf-α, ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and mcp- <dig> were all elevated in circumvallate and foliate epithelia . the expression levels of il-1β in lps-treated samples were not significantly different from those in pbs-treated samples  <dig> h after lps injection . it remains to be determined whether lps stimulates the expression of il-1β at other time points after treatment. these results suggest that systemic administration of lps can induce a robust inflammatory response in taste epithelium, consistent with recent studies that demonstrate the preferential expression of various inflammatory receptors, signaling proteins, and cytokines in taste buds  <cit> . mcp- <dig> expression in taste papillae can also be upregulated by gustatory nerve injury  <cit> .

genbank accession numbers for the sequences used to select the corresponding primers are given. the sizes of the predicted pcr products are indicated in base pairs.

to characterize the types of cells that produce these inflammatory molecules in taste papillae, we performed immunostaining using antibodies against tnf-α and ifn-γ. both ifn-γ and tnf-α antibodies stained a subset of cells in the circumvallate taste buds after lps treatment . species-matched non-specific control antibodies did not show any specific staining in the taste buds. pre-incubation of the antibodies with their corresponding antigens eliminated the staining of taste bud cells . next, we performed colocalization studies using these antibodies on taste tissue sections from trpm5-gfp transgenic mice   <cit>  . these experiments showed that the immunoreactivities of ifn-γ and tnf-α antibodies localized to trpm <dig> expressing cells. these results suggest that some taste bud cells can produce inflammatory cytokines after lps stimulation.

lps-induced inflammation inhibits taste bud cell renewal and shortens the lifespan of taste cells
to investigate the effects of inflammation on taste cell turnover, we used the well-established 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine  pulse-chase method to follow the process of cell turnover  <cit> . in order to label an adequate number of taste cells, mice were injected with five doses of brdu over a 12-h period. one dose of lps or pbs  was injected intraperitoneally  <dig> h after the first brdu injection. taste tissues were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after the initial brdu administration. tissue sections containing circumvallate taste buds were processed for immunofluorescent staining using antibodies against brdu as well as kcnq <dig>  a marker protein for taste bud cells  <cit> . representative immunostaining images from both lps- and pbs-treated groups are shown in figure  <dig>  consistent with published studies  <cit> , the majority of brdu-positive cells reside in the basal layer of circumvallate epithelium outside of taste buds  <dig> day after brdu injection for both lps and pbs groups. from day  <dig> through day  <dig>  most of the brdu-positive cells in both groups gradually migrated from the basal to the apical regions of perigemmal epithelium, and only a small percentage of brdu-positive cells were incorporated into the taste buds . similar to previously published results  <cit> , a small number of brdu-positive taste cells were observed  <dig> and  <dig> days after brdu injection , suggesting that some taste cells can survive much longer than the estimated average life span of taste bud cells   <cit> .

to quantitatively analyze the data, we counted the number of brdu-labeled cells within the profiles of circumvallate taste buds. the counting criteria are described in detail in the methods section. the average numbers of brdu-positive cells per taste bud profile are summarized in table  <dig>  and the time course is plotted in figure 4a. based on the time-course curves, we estimated the average taste bud cell entry time, turnover period, and life span using previously described methods  <cit> . for the control group, our experiments showed that the average taste bud cell entry time was  <dig>  days and the average taste cell turnover period was  <dig> days . both time periods were slightly longer than those reported by others  <cit> , likely due to the differences in dna labeling methods  and injection schedules . even given these differences, the traditional estimates and ours are remarkably similar.

mice injected with brdu and pbs or lps were sacrificed at the indicated time points. circumvallate sections were stained with antibodies against brdu and kcnq <dig>  confocal fluorescent images were used to count brdu-labeled cells inside the taste bud profiles defined by the kcnq <dig> staining. the total numbers of taste bud profiles examined and the brdu-labeled taste bud cells counted, as well as the average number of brdu-labeled cells per taste bud profile, are shown for each time point. these numbers were used to generate the time course curves shown in figure 4a.

compared with controls, lps treatment altered several aspects of taste cell turnover: 1) the average taste bud cell entry time was slightly longer for the lps group  than for the pbs group  ; 2) the number of brdu-positive cells entering the taste buds was significantly reduced at multiple time points for the lps group compared with the pbs group ; and 3) the turnover period for taste bud cells, an indication of the average time for a cell to stay in taste buds, was shorter for the lps group  than for the pbs group  . together, these results suggest that lps-induced inflammation inhibits taste bud cell renewal and accelerates taste cell turnover.

we also counted brdu-labeled cells in the perigemmal regions of circumvallate epithelium . consistent with published studies  <cit> , the turnover periods of perigemmal keratinocytes were much shorter than those of taste bud cells, with a turnover period estimated to be  <dig>  days for the pbs group and  <dig>  days for the lps group . similar to its effect on taste bud cells, lps treatment also significantly decreased the number of brdu-labeled cells in the perigemmal cell population .

experiments were carried out as described in table  <dig>  brdu and kcnq <dig> immunostaining images were used to count brdu-labeled perigemmal cells in the circumvallate epithelium of pbs- or lps-treated mice. the total numbers of brdu-labeled perigemmal cells and the total areas of circumvallate epithelium counted, as well as the average numbers of brdu-labeled cells/mm <dig> of circumvallate epithelium, are shown for each time point. these numbers were used to generate the time course curves shown in figure 5a.

lps inhibits proliferation of progenitor cells for taste buds
recent studies suggest that taste bud cells and surrounding keratinocytes are derived from a common progenitor cell population residing in the basal regions surrounding the taste buds  <cit> . this group of progenitor cells expresses cell proliferation markers as well as cell lineage regulators, such as patched <dig>  sox <dig>  trp <dig>  and ki <dig>  <cit> , reflecting their proliferative properties and roles in cell fate determination. since lps treatment inhibits the renewal of both taste bud cells and perigemmal keratinocytes , it is possible that the common progenitor cells for both cell lineages are affected.

to investigate whether lps suppresses proliferation of progenitor cells for taste buds, we examined the expression of ki <dig>  a cell proliferation marker expressed in all active stages of the cell cycle  <cit> . quantitative real-time rt-pcr revealed that the expression level of ki <dig> mrna was dramatically reduced in the circumvallate and foliate epithelia  <dig> h after lps treatment . in contrast, ki <dig> expression levels were not significantly different in nontaste lingual epithelium from pbs- versus lps-treated mice. to investigate whether the decreased expression of ki <dig> by lps in taste epithelium was due to a reduction of proliferating taste progenitor cells, we performed immunostaining using antibodies against ki <dig>  we confirmed that in the circumvallate epithelium, the ki <dig> antibody recognized a group of cells in the basal regions surrounding taste buds, the niche for taste progenitor cells . ki67-immunoreative cells were also positive for k <dig> immunostaining , a marker for taste progenitor cells  <cit> . lps treatment markedly reduced the number of ki67-positive cells and the intensity of ki <dig> staining in the basal regions surrounding circumvallate taste buds . in contrast, ki <dig> staining was comparable in nontaste lingual epithelia from pbs- and lps-treated mice . together, the results from these experiments and brdu-labeling experiments demonstrate that lps-induced inflammation inhibits taste progenitor cell proliferation.

lps suppresses the expression of cyclin b <dig> and e2f <dig> in taste epithelium
to further investigate the effects of lps-induced inflammation on taste progenitor cell proliferation, we carried out quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis using the mouse cell cycle rt <dig> profiler pcr array from sabiosciences. this pcr array contains primers for  <dig> genes involved in cell cycle regulation as well as several genes as endogenous controls . figure 7a compares the expression of these genes in the circumvallate and foliate epithelia from pbs- and lps-treated mice. only the genes that displayed >4-fold decrease in expression in lps samples are labeled: ki <dig> , e2f <dig> , chek <dig>  , brca <dig>  , and cyclin b <dig> . additional file  <dig> lists all the genes examined by pcr array analysis.

the decreased expression of ki <dig> by lps is consistent with the result shown in figure 6a, which was based on rt-pcr experiments using independently designed primers . of the other four genes, chek <dig> and brca <dig> are involved in dna damage response and repair  <cit> , whereas cyclin b <dig> and e2f <dig> directly regulate cell cycle progression. cyclin b <dig>  one of the three mammalian b-type cyclins, is an interacting partner for cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>   <cit> . cdk1/cyclin b <dig> complexes are essential for the reorganization of the golgi apparatus during mitosis <cit> . e2f <dig> is a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle progression by activating the transcription of numerous genes required for cell division  <cit> . decreased expression of cyclin b <dig> and e2f <dig> may contribute to the suppression of taste progenitor cell proliferation by lps. to validate the data generated through the pcr array experiment, we carried out real-time rt-pcr reactions for cyclin b <dig> and e2f <dig> using independently designed primers . the results showed that the expression of these two critical cell cycle regulators was indeed inhibited by lps .

discussion
inflammation and taste progenitor cell proliferation
inflammation is a complex process involving the interplay of numerous factors such as cytokines  and chemokines. the effects of inflammation on cell proliferation are multifaceted, with different outcomes depending on cell types, disease models, and the inflammatory factors involved  <cit> . in adult brain hippocampus, lps-induced inflammation is detrimental to neurogenesis, whereas deficiency of tlr <dig>  the receptor for lps, results in enhanced progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation  <cit> . however, inflammation induced by ischemia and mechanical injury can stimulate proliferation and promote neurogenesis  <cit> . similarly, although il- <dig> is shown to inhibit neural progenitor cell proliferation and newborn cell survival, tnf-α can either impair proliferation and survival or support neurogenesis, depending on the expression of tnf receptors and the models employed  <cit> . the mechanisms by which inflammation mediates these varying effects on cell proliferation and survival are largely unknown.

our results showed that lps-induced inflammation stimulated the expression of several inflammatory cytokines in taste papillae . lps treatment inhibited proliferation of taste progenitor cells  and reduced the number of newborn cells entering taste buds . in line with the hypothesis that taste bud cells and perigemmal keratinocytes share a common progenitor cell pool  <cit> , lps treatment also reduced the number of newborn perigemmal cells in the circumvallate epithelium . it is likely that the decreased expression of cyclin b <dig> and e2f <dig> , two crucial regulators of cell cycle progression, is involved in this inhibition. yet, it is unclear what molecular pathways lead to the suppression of cyclin b <dig>  e2f <dig>  and ki <dig> in the taste epithelium upon lps treatment. previously, we have shown that tlr <dig> is expressed in the taste epithelium  <cit> . it is conceivable that lps may directly or indirectly activate cells in taste epithelium and stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, which may inhibit taste progenitor cell proliferation. future studies will identify the molecular pathways responsible for this inhibition.

pcr array experiments showed that lps downregulated the expression of brca <dig> and chek <dig> in the taste epithelium; both genes are involved in the detection and repair of dna damages  <cit> . reduced activities of brca <dig> and chek <dig> may loosen the control of cell cycle checkpoints for dna defects and result in an accumulation of dna mutations in proliferating cells. in addition, it is known that inflammation, through the generation of reactive oxygen species, increases dna damage  <cit> . these effects together may impose a threat to genome integrity and increase susceptibility to tumorigenesis and accumulation of somatic mutations in taste tissues  <cit> .

inflammation and taste cell degeneration and turnover
p <dig>  bax, and caspase- <dig> have been implicated in the physiological turnover of taste bud cells  <cit> . the taste buds from bax-deficient mice contain more than twice the normal number of taste cells  <cit> . other apoptosis-related genes, such as caspase- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  are also detected in the taste buds and some show higher levels of expression in taste cells than in nontaste cells  <cit> . we previously demonstrated that ifn-α and γ stimulate the activation of caspase- <dig> and increase apoptosis in taste buds  <cit> . in this study, we showed that lps injection rapidly induced the expression of ifn-γ in trpm5-positive taste receptor cells , suggesting that lps may accelerate cell death of some taste bud cells through the ifn pathways.

indeed, brdu pulse-chase experiments revealed that lps-induced inflammation moderately shortened the average life span of taste bud cells , indicating that cell death occurs faster in taste buds after lps treatment. this effect of lps seems modest. however, it is possible that lps administration shortens the life span of only a subset of taste cells. therefore, although the average life span of all brdu-labeled taste cells was not markedly altered, some types of taste cells might have been affected to a greater level than the average. the restricted induction of ifn-γ in a subset of taste cells is in line with this notion . previous research showed that different subtypes of taste cells may have different cell turnover rates  <cit> . light or type ii taste receptor cells, which express the sweet, bitter, and umami receptors and their downstream signaling components , seem to have longer life spans than do dark or type i cells  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether lps-induced inflammation selectively accelerates the turnover rates of only subtypes of taste bud cells. furthermore, mechanisms other than increased cell death may also contribute to the shortened average life span of taste cells. for instance, the population of different types of taste cells may be altered by lps towards one with a shorter life span in the buds.

it should be noted that the acute inflammation induced by lps also activates anti-inflammatory pathways following the peak of inflammatory response. these anti-inflammatory mechanisms dampen immune reactions and facilitate resolution of inflammation. in taste tissues, the presence of such pathways may reduce the effects of inflammation and promote the recovery of taste bud structure and function after acute infections and other inflammatory insults. effects of lps on taste cells are likely to be the consequences of the orchestrated action of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways.

inflammation and taste disorders
compared to nontaste lingual epithelial cells, taste bud cells are enriched with a number of molecules that play key roles in the process of inflammation. several tlrs, including the lps receptor tlr <dig>  are preferentially expressed in the taste buds  <cit> . these higher levels of expression of tlrs may account for the more robust production of inflammatory cytokines in the taste epithelium after an inflammatory challenge. preferential expression in the taste buds was also observed for some chemokines, such as cxcl <dig> and il- <dig>  as well as cytokine receptors  <cit> . this expression pattern may normally protect taste cells from pathogens, but can also lead to detrimental consequences under excessive or chronic inflammatory conditions.

as shown in this study, lps-induced inflammation, which mimics gram-negative bacterial infections and releases a plethora of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> , has an adverse impact on taste bud structure. lps treatment has been shown to alter the preference for sweet and bitter taste compounds  <cit> . although whether these behavioral changes are related to the changes in taste buds has not been determined, the present study suggests that inflammation, an underlying condition in various diseases associated with taste disorders, affects taste bud cells and may contribute to the development of taste dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of inflammation on taste bud cell turnover. lps-induced systemic inflammation strongly inhibits taste progenitor cell proliferation and results in reduced number of newborn cells entering the taste buds. this inhibition correlates with decreased expression of ki <dig>  cyclin b <dig>  and e2f <dig> in circumvallate and foliate epithelia; the latter two genes play important roles in cell proliferation. in addition, lps modestly shortens the average turnover period of taste bud cells. these results support the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to the development of taste disorders associated with infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.
