BACKGROUND
dementia of vascular origin i.e. vascular dementia  has gained much attention in the recent times. after alzheimer disease , vad is the second most common cause of dementia. in the vascular system, nitric oxide  generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase  plays an important role in maintenance of vascular tone  <cit> . hyperhomocysteinemia , or elevation of plasma total homocysteine, is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke and vascular dementia  <cit> . hhcy has been shown to induce endothelial dysfunction by decreasing the bioavailability of no, and increasing vascular oxidative stress  <cit> . the decreased no level has been demonstrated to contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia  <cit> .

increased levels of homocysteine have been documented to produce changes in structure and function of cerebral blood vessels along with oxidative stress, which play a key role in cerebral vascular dysfunction  <cit> . oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction are recognized as important contributing factors in the pathogenesis of ad and other dementia of vascular origin  <cit> . in ad and other neurodegenerative diseases, structural deformities in the cerebral capillaries lead to impairment of cerebral perfusion with subsequent neuronal dysfunction and death  <cit> . the well established risk factors of endothelial dysfunction and subsequent vascular dementia such as hypertension, history of stroke, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia are all associated with high risk of ad. the noted vascular dysfunction  in ad and common risk factor of ad and vad suggest a great overlap between ad and vascular dementia  <cit> . moreover, hhcy has been documented to increase cholesterol synthesis  <cit> . studies have revealed that in addition to elevated β-amyloid peptides and apoe levels, high cholesterol level is another important risk factor for ad  <cit> .

only limited therapeutic interventions are available to reduce the incidence of vad. cholinesterase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and glutamate antagonists are few classes of pharmacological agents which are being clinically explored to reduce symptomatically the impact of cognitive dysfunction associated with vascular dementia  <cit> . however, an agent that should improve both endothelial dysfunction and associated dementia still need to be explored. very recently, the focus has been directed towards statins , which are most widely prescribed drugs for dyslipidemias  <cit> . statins in additions to their cholesterol lowering action are known to possess many cholesterol independent actions including favorable effect on vascular endothelium  <cit> . moreover, there is an emerging data indicating that statins exert neuroprotective and antioxidant actions  <cit> . statins have been shown to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke and related memory impairment by a variety of mechanisms  <cit> . epidemiological studies have suggested that individuals above  <dig> years of age, who were receiving statins, had a substantially lowered risk of developing dementia, independent of the presence or absence of untreated hyperlipidemia, or exposure to non-statin lipid-lowering drugs  <cit> . however, there are conflicting observations regarding the effect of statins on cognitive functions. although, there are a few studies showing cognitive decline  <cit> , some studies showing no effect on memory  <cit> , yet few studies suggest improvement of cognitive functions with statin therapy. therefore, implication of statins in endothelial dysfunction and related dementia deserves further investigation.

discussion
young male rats were employed in the present study, as it is reported that aging and consequent variation of estrogen in blood modulates the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , which further affects the function of vascular endothelium and memory  <cit> . morris water maze test employed in present study is one of the most widely accepted models to evaluate learning and memory of the animals  <cit> . nitric oxide  synthesized in the endothelium and its levels get attenuated during endothelial dysfunction. endogenously formed no is highly unstable and gets converted to nitrate and nitrite  <cit> . therefore, serum nitrite concentration has been employed as specific a marker of endothelial dysfunction  <cit> .

a significant decrease in escape latency time  of control animals during ongoing acquisition trials denoted normal acquisition of memory and an increase in time spent in target quadrant , in search of missing platform during retrieval trial indicated, retrieval of memory. these results are consistent to our earlier findings and reports from other laboratory  <cit> .

l-methionine treatment for  <dig> weeks, in the present study significantly raised serum homocysteine level, decreased serum nitrite levels and markedly attenuated acetylcholine induced endothelium dependent relaxation, therefore, reflecting endothelial dysfunction. further l-methionine administration also produced a significant impairment of acquisition and retrieval of memory as reflected by decreased morris water-maze performance. moreover, an enhancement of brain acetyl cholinesterase  activity, increase in brain oxidative stress  and increase in serum total cholesterol levels were also observed. recently, it has been reported that chronic experimental hyperhomocysteinemia produce cognitive dysfunction  <cit> , and increase in brain ache activity  <cit> . l-methionine induced hyperhomocysteinemia is a well established model of experimental endothelial dysfunction  <cit> . hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to induce endothelial dysfunction by decreasing the bioavailability of no and by increasing vascular oxidative stress  <cit> . our observation also supports above contention, as a significant fall in serum nitrite levels along with rise in oxidative stress levels  were noted in l-methionine treated rats.

the increased level of homocysteine has been reported to produce change in structure and function of cerebral blood vessels along with oxidative stress, which play a key role in cerebral vascular dysfunction  <cit> . several lines of evidences have strongly advocated a direct relationship between vascular endothelial dysfunction and dementia better known as vascular dementia  <cit> . cerebral vascular endothelial dysfunction has also been shown to enhance progression of dementia of alzheimer disease   <cit> . enhanced levels of brain ache activity and oxidative stress have also been noted in patients suffering form dementia of ad and other dementias  <cit> .

further hyperhomocysteinemia has also been shown to be neurotoxic, and the neurotoxicity may be due to over activation of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors or by enhanced vulnerability of hippocampal neuron to excitotoxic insults and amyloid β-peptide toxicity  <cit> . moreover, methionine rich diet in rats has been demonstrated to enhance cholesterol concentration in the plasma and liver  <cit> . several studies have also revealed high serum cholesterol level as another important risk factor of ad  <cit> . therefore l-methionine induced memory dysfunction in the present study may be attributed to its multiple effects i.e. decrease in serum nitrite level , rise in oxidative stress level, enhancement of brain ache activity, serum total cholesterol as well as direct neurotoxicity.

in the present study, treatment with atorvastatin and pitavastatin significantly improved l-methionine induced endothelial dysfunction manifested in the terms of endothelium dependent relaxation; increased serum nitrite levels, decreased serum homocysteine, and decreased oxidative stress . statins, in addition to their cholesterol lowering action has been reported to exert number of cholesterol independent actions i.e. pleotropic actions. statins have been demonstrated to enhance the expression of enos in human endothelial cells  <cit> . they have been known to activate akt/protein kinase b, which subsequently activates enos  <cit> . studies with atorvastatin and simvastatin have shown to inhibit the expression of prepro-endothelin - <dig> mrna and reduce plasma et- <dig> levels, endothelin being a potent vasoconstricting agent  <cit> . furthermore, statins appear to inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids, compounds that are required for the posttranslational modification of important signaling molecules such as rho, rac, and ras  <cit> . inhibition of rho activation has been shown to increase endothelial no production  <cit>  and reduces et- <dig> expression  <cit> . recently, atorvastatin has been documented to improve the function of endothelium by lowering the expression of p22phox and production of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . further, in another recent report it has been indicated that hyperhomocysteinemia induce impairment of no production through the modulation of cav- <dig> expression associated with a loss of enos in caveolae  <cit> . statins have been shown to prevent the expression of caveolin, a negative regulator of enos  <cit> . therefore atorvastatin and pitavastatin induced improvement of endothelial dysfunction in our study may be attributed to their stimulatory effect on endothelial nitric oxide production and their antioxidative action.

further, administration of atorvastatin/pitavastatin in the present investigation also, reversed memory deficit induced by l-methionine . several recent clinical reports have suggested that the net brain cholesterol concentration is regulated by serum cholesterol level and there is a cross talk between the cns and peripheral cholesterol pools  <cit> . cholesterol turnover appears to play a crucial role in the deposition and clearance of amyloid peptide in brain and apoe is a cholesterol transporting protein that is associated with amyloid deposits  <cit> . further, serum cholesterol, atherosclerosis, apolipoprotein-e and ad all appear to be interconnected  <cit> . studies involving cultured rat cortical neurons have revealed neuroprotective action of atorvastatin against glutamate induced excitotoxicity  <cit> .

in our recent studies, we have reported that atorvastatin, simvastatin and pitavastatin reversed memory deficits of rats and mice associated with dementia of ad type and memory improving effects of these statins mediated through their cholesterol dependent and in dependent actions  <cit> . furthermore, statins have also been shown to exert beneficial effects in cerebral ischemia and stroke providing neuroprotection via enhancement of no production  <cit> .

many studies, in the recent years have implicated a vital role for no in neurophysiological process of learning and memory  <cit> . inhibition of no system impaired memory in rats  <cit> . whereas, stimulation of no production improved cognitive functions in alzheimer patients  <cit> . no, donors like molsidomine reversed scopolamine induced amnesia in rats  <cit> . no probably, acts as retrograde messenger in the formation of long term potentiation  at the molecular level of learning and memory processes  <cit> . therefore, atorvastatin and pitavastatin in present investigation appear to reverse l-methionine induced memory deficits via multiple actions viz; decrease in total cholesterol, brain oxidative stress  levels, ache activity and increase in serum nitrite levels. nevertheless, further studies incorporating female rats as well as other species of animals such as mice, using different memory model , duly supported by histopathology of brain tissue are required in order to support and extend potential of these statins in endothelial dysfunction related memory deficits.

CONCLUSIONS
it may be concluded that chronic l-methionine administration  has produced endothelial dysfunction along with impairment of learning and memory . atorvastatin and pitavastatin exerted beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction and related memory deficits by virtue of their cholesterol dependent as well as cholesterol independent actions. perhaps this is the first report highlighting potential of statins in l-methionine induced endothelial dysfunction associated memory deficits.
