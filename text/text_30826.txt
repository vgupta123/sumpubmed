BACKGROUND
dengue infection is an important mosquito-borne viral infection in areas where mosquitoes breed under optimal conditions. as a member of the family falviviridae, the dengue virus is transmitted to human via aedes genus, especially aedes agypti. this family also includes hepatitis c virus, west nile virus and yellow fever virus. dengue virus has four serotypes den 1- <dig>  sequencing of dengue viral rna has further verified strain variation within a serotype allowing viruses to be classified into genetically distinct groups within serotypes called genotypes. this virus is prevalent in areas of asia, africa, central and south america  <cit> 
. dengue viral infection can either cause dengue fever , dengue hemorrhagic fever  or dengue shock syndrome . the classical dengue fever is mild, febrile illness which usually results after primary infection with dengue virus. in other cases df can lead to dhf or dss which can be life threatening  <cit> . infection with a different serotype can show severe outcome due to antibody dependent enhancement  <cit>  and can be a risk factor for dhf and dss  <cit> . though dual infection with dengue virus is attributed to cause onset of severe disease  <cit>  but a case of mild disease due to dual infection was documented in brazil in  <dig>  <cit> . outcome of disease may also depend upon the genotype involved. some genotypes induce greater viremia and are transmitted more readily, thereby having a higher potential to cause large epidemic  <cit> .

timely and correct diagnosis is very critical for patient management as no definitive vaccine has been developed against all dengue virus serotypes. methods are being employed for diagnosing the dengue virus infection like viral isolation techniques, serological methods and molecular methods. viral isolation methods are time consuming and usually take a week  <cit> . use of serological methods by detecting viral anti-igm anti-igg can give false positive results due to extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among flavivirus as well as between different dengue virus serotypes  <cit> . different types of polymerase chain reactions  like reverse -transcription pcr , real-time pcr and nested or hemi-nested pcr are used for detecting genomic sequence for serotyping. use of pcr techniques is a quick and sensitive method for detecting dengue virus and has replaced viral isolation techniques  <cit> .

several outbreaks due to the dengue virus infection have been reported from pakistan  <cit> . dengue infection was first documented in pakistan in year  <dig> from punjab in which  <dig> patients out of total  <dig> were found positive for dengue virus; all these samples were collected in <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the first outbreak of dhf was documented in  <dig> by chan and colleagues  <cit>  who observed den- <dig> and den- <dig> in three out of ten tested patients for dengue virus. in the following year, den- <dig> infection was reported from the province of balochistan  <cit> . through serological studies, dengue type  <dig> and type  <dig> were found in sera of children in karachi  <cit> . jamil and colleagues  <cit>  had previously been reported den- <dig> infection in  <dig> outbreak of dhf in karachi. kan and colleagues  <cit>  reported co-circulation of dengue virus type  <dig> and type  <dig> in  <dig> outbreak in karachi. more recently, hamayoun and colleagues  <cit>  reported cases with dengue infection in the  <dig> outbreak in lahore. out of  <dig> samples checked via real-time pcr, ten of their patients had den- <dig>  five had den- <dig> and two had den- <dig> infection  <cit> .

pakistan has a history of outbreaks of dengue viral infection however, the responsible serotype/s is not well known. therefore, the current study was initiated to determine the circulating serotype/s of dengue virus in pakistan using molecular based techniques in patients' sera. samples were selected from stored repository from three most recent outbreaks of dengue virus  and the obtained sequences were compared to other dengue virus sequences reported from other geographical regions of the world to deduce a phylogenetic relationship.

RESULTS
serotyping of analyzed sample
a total of  <dig> suspected dengue serum samples along with demographic data were kindly donated by gurki trust hospital lahore and sheikh zayed medical complex lahore for the current study. these samples were collected during three different mini outbreaks of dengue virus infection in years  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and were stored at -20Â°c. nested pcr was utilized for this serotype analysis. out of total  <dig> tested serum samples,  <dig> were found positive for dengue virus rna with various serotypes. table  <dig> shows the distribution of dengue virus serotypes in the study population. it is clear from the results of the current study that, of the  <dig> dengue virus positive samples, six had concurrent infection with two different dengue virus serotypes at a time generating data of  <dig> serotypes.

*out of  <dig> positive samples,  <dig> samples had concurrent infection with two dengue virus serotypes giving a total of  <dig> dengue virus isolates.

nucleotide sequences analysis
the amplified bands of each sample were gel eluted and were further used for sequence analysis. junction of c-prm gene of dengue virus isolates was chosen for serotyping. accession numbers of these  <dig> studied sequences are . the length of amplified product was  <dig> base pairs  for serotype  <dig> and  <dig> bp for serotype  <dig>  the blast search was done and the sequences of serotype  <dig> were found close to a sri lankan strain  with an average of 99% homology. the sequences of serotype  <dig> were close to a chinese strain  with an average homology of 99%. these two strains were taken as prototypes for respective serotypes. the c-prm fragment of serotype  <dig> was found to be rich in ag composition with an average percentage of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the c-prm gene junction of serotype  <dig> was also found ag rich with an average percentage of  <dig> % for a and  <dig> % for g.

further the obtained nucleotide sequences were translated using the bioedit software. translated results showed that amino acid tyrosine is not present in the polyprotein fragment of serotype  <dig>  this region is rich in leucine with an average of  <dig> % followed by arginine . the polyprotein fragment of serotype  <dig> was found rich in leucine  and lysine with an average of  <dig> %.

multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the sequences
phylogenetic tree was conducted using the mega  <dig> software and multiple sequence alignment was deduced by using bioedit software. a region corresponding to nt122- <dig>  of the prototype was aligned for sequences of serotype  <dig>  similarly region of nt158- <dig>  was aligned for the sequences of serotype  <dig>  regions of both of the serotypes were not hyper variable. no insertions or deletions were seen in the regions of both serotypes. a slight variation in nucleotide sequences and translated polyprotein sequences was observed for sequences of serotype  <dig>  the serotype  <dig> sequences were almost identical and same type of polyprotein was translated from the nucleotide sequences. phylogenetic analysis was constructed among the sequenced isolates as well with different geographical isolates sequences. the sequences were retrieved from genbank data base and  <dig> diverse sequences from different geographical regions were selected for serotype  <dig>  for serotype  <dig>  eleven sequences from different geographical regions of the world and  <dig> sequences from pakistan were selected. a 329-bp region  for serotype  <dig> and 219-bp region  for serotype  <dig> was chosen. on constructing the tree, the sequenced serotype  <dig> lied in the category of genotype iv . the sequences fall in genotype iv with northern indian strains. as there are no submitted sequences of genotype ii and iv for capsid region of serotype  <dig>  so the tree was constructed using sequences from genotype i and iii. but the tree clearly showed that the studied sequences of serotype  <dig> had genotype iii . they fall in the same genotype with indian strains and other three pakistani strains from karachi.

discussion
over the years dengue fever has become an important arboviral infection in different geographical regions of the world that supports the growth of mosquitoes. its range exceeds over a hundred tropical and subtropical countries with more than  <dig>  billion people at the risk of infection  <cit> . pakistan has witnessed some severe outbreaks of dengue viral infection leading to significant morbidity and mortality since  <dig>  <cit> . since the publication of a study in  <dig> documenting dengue infection from the years  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , several mini outbreaks of dengue viral infection have been reported. no doubt all the four distinct serotypes, den- <dig>  den- <dig>  den- <dig>  and den- <dig> of dengue virus have been reported as the cause of dengue infection; however, serotypes den- <dig> and den- <dig> remained the major cause of infection in humans world-wide. like other parts of the world, in the current study we have observed that serotypes den- <dig> and den- <dig> are the predominant serotypes in dengue infection in outbreaks of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in pakistan. in  <dig>  serotype den- <dig> prevailed with less occurrence of serotype den- <dig>  in samples of  <dig> and  <dig>  serotype den- <dig> has been isolated, though first incidence of serotype  <dig> infections was reported by jamil and colleagues  <cit>  in year  <dig> outbreak in karachi. this shows that serotype  <dig> is new comer to this region as was isolated for the first time in year  <dig>  all the previous outbreaks have been attributed to other serotypes. from lahore, hamayoun and colleagues  <cit>  reported only serotype den- <dig> in  <dig> outbreak and they were unable to isolate any other serotype. this finding of hamayoun  <cit>  confirms the results of our study as serotype  <dig> is the only serotype we have seen from stored samples of that particular outbreak of  <dig> 

in the present study we were able to characterize a very low number of suspected dengue samples  on molecular level. this may be due to the reason that majority of samples were collected from suspected gangue virus infected patients in post viremic phase. for the correct molecular characterization of the virus, samples should be collected in acute phase of infection. presentation of patients in post viremic phase or lower rate of viral isolation may be the reason of getting only twenty samples with positive results for dengue virus  <cit> . use of serum sample for viral isolation has been advocated previously in many studies  <cit>  so we extracted viral rna using sera samples. the region of c-prm gene junction was selected for serotyping as the region is not very hyper variable and most of the mutations reported are of silent type  <cit> . lifecycle of dengue virus involves both human and mosquitoes and this might be the reason for low rate of variation among dengue virus as compared to other rna viruses. according to several reports, the classification of dengue genotypes is based on less than 6% of nucleotide divergence within a selected genomic region  <cit> . dendrograms were drawn to study the evolutionary history of the sequenced serotypes as well as their genotypes which showed that serotype  <dig> circulating in 2007- <dig> belonged to genotype iv. strains from northern india, china and indonesia also fall in this subtype  <cit> . no particular pattern of genotype distribution can be inferred for serotype  <dig> as different genotypes spread in diverse locations. for serotype  <dig>  only sequences of capsid region from genotype i and iii are reported. so the tree was created using global sequences of genotype i and iii only. however, the tree visibly shows that the studied serotype  <dig> has genotype iii. it is clear from the findings of our study that there is no definite pattern of distribution of subtype iii of dengue virus  <dig> worldwide  <cit> . the previously sequenced three strains from karachi  in  <dig>  <cit>  also have same genotype emphasizing the fact that genotype iii of dengue virus  <dig> prevails in pakistan. there is not much data available from pakistan on serotypes of dengue virus; this study is the first one to characterize serotypes  <dig> and  <dig> in their respective subtypes. the only limitation of this study is small number of sequenced samples. there is a need for more randomized and multi-analysis studies to be conducted on serotyping and subtyping of different dengue strains in pakistan; in this way a clearer view on spread of dengue virus can be made.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the findings of the current study we conclude that the predominant serotypes of dengue virus circulating in pakistan are  <dig> and  <dig>  ample number of cases with mixed serotypes  are seen and might be common in all regions of this country. the major genotypes circulated in the study period are subtype iv of dengue virus  <dig> and subtype iii of dengue virus  <dig>
