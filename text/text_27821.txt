BACKGROUND
p <dig> is a nodal convergence point of integrated intra-cellular signaling networks that mediate cellular responses to stress . it regulates expression of many stress-related target genes and their proteins, such as p <dig>  gadd <dig>  bax, puma, and noxa, by binding to the p <dig> response element  in their promoter regions
 <cit> . p <dig> is tightly regulated, however, as a “cellular gatekeeper”
 <cit>  and the three-step activation process of p <dig> is complex: stabilization, dna binding, and transcriptional activation
 <cit> . as many as  <dig> individual posttranslational modifications contribute to or influence the ability of p <dig> to function as a sequence-specific transcription factor during normal homeostasis and stress-induced responses
 <cit> .

p <dig> activation is also modulated by transcriptional co-activators  and inhibited by a variety of proteins, such as mdm <dig> and mdm <dig>  which ubiquitinates p <dig> targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation. thus, p <dig> and mdm <dig> form a negative feedback regulatory loop. mdm2-mediated p <dig> destruction is synergistic with histone deacetylase  <dig> : these molecules often complex together, coupling p <dig> deacetylation and ubiquitination
 <cit> .

p <dig> is also subject to, and exerts, cytoplasmic influences
 <cit> . p <dig> phosphorylation by kinases , and chk1/chk <dig> is regarded as the first crucial step in p <dig> stabilization
 <cit> . post-translational p <dig> acetylation helps regulate protein concentrations and transcriptional activity
 <cit> . cellular stress  and over expression of p300/cbp
 <cit>  causes k382-p <dig> acetylation and p <dig> protein accumulation
 <cit> . the latter also results in increased sequence specific p53-dna binding
 <cit> . other p <dig> lysine modifications such as methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and neddylation also have the potential to alter p53’s transcriptional activity
 <cit> .

typically, p <dig> enhanced transcriptional activity increases p <dig> expression during cellular stress, which in turn, blocks cell cycle progression and inhibits proliferation. p <dig> activation can also block epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  via upregulation of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> family members that repress zeb1/ <dig> expression
 <cit> , which are key mediators of emt. paradoxically, these p53-directed stress responses, p <dig> upregulation and emt blockage, are at odds with the two main processes needed in the epithelia for wound repair: proliferation and migration
 <cit> .

small proline rich protein  2a, one of  <dig> sprr genes coded in the region of the epidermal differentiation complex
 <cit> , is coordinately expressed with other genes in the complex. in the normal skin it functions primarily as a keratinocyte cross-linking protein that confers structural integrity to the cornified cell envelope
 <cit> . exciting new evidence, however, shows non-coordinate, independent up-regulation of sprr proteins occurs almost universally in a variety of pathophysiological conditions involving stress and wound repair in the barrier epithelia . remaining viable epithelial cells at the edges of wounds transiently undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
 <cit> , a process essential for the restitution/migration phase of epithelial wound healing
 <cit> .

previous data from our group showed that forced expression of sprr2a in the cholangiocarcinoma cell line sg <dig>  at levels similar to those seen during wound repair responses, induced emt and significantly reduced cell death under h2o2- and glycochenodeoxycholate-induced cell injury
 <cit> . parallel observations were made in keratinocytes
 <cit> . therefore, beyond its role in skin cornification, sprr proteins have a widespread role in tissue remodeling and function as global links between ros detoxification and cell migration during wound healing
 <cit> . these observations prompted us to test the hypothesis that stress induced non-coordinate upregulation of sprr2a in barrier epithelia counteracts the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  thereby enabling cellular adaptations needed for normal wound repair under stressful circumstances.

RESULTS
sprr2a blocks acetylation of k382-p53
we first determined whether sprr2a protein expression in hucct- <dig> cells altered the distribution of flag-tagged p <dig> transfected protein, which it did not. p <dig> and sprr2a proteins were detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm , but sprr2a did not change the distribution of p <dig>  in contrast, p <dig> and its cysteine/histidine-rich  region  <dig> deletion construct distributed primarily to the nucleus, but low-level cytoplasmic localization was also seen . cytoplasmic p <dig> can ubiquinate p <dig> and target it for destruction thereby preventing cytoplasmic p <dig> accumulation
 <cit> . the intra-cellular distribution of sprr2a was confirmed by expression of a ds-red-sprr2a construct that showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic protein expression in hucct- <dig> cells . 

simultaneous over expression of p <dig> and p <dig> significantly increased the level of ac-k382-p <dig>  indicating that in hucct- <dig> cells, p <dig> acetylation involves p <dig> . co-transfection of hucct- <dig> with combinations of sprr2a, p <dig>  and p <dig> vectors showed the following: 1) in the presence of p <dig> over expression, sprr2a caused a decrease in ac-k382-p <dig>  both with and without p <dig> transfection. 2) sprr2a transfection decreased p <dig> acetylation in the absence of p <dig> over expression, suggesting that sprr2a also influences p <dig> acetylation/stabilization through other non-p <dig> related mechanisms .

to verify that the sprr2a reduction in ac-k382-p <dig> was not a consequence of p <dig> and/or p <dig> over expression, we used a cell line stably transfected with sprr2a alone to determine the effects on endogenous p <dig>  the sprr2a clone showed a marked reduction in endogenous ac-k382-p <dig> when compared to its vector control . hucct- <dig> cells harbor a point mutation  in p <dig>  which reduces  binding to the p <dig> promoter . therefore, sprr2a is capable of decreasing acetylation of both endogenous  p <dig> and transfected  p <dig> . to verify that the reduced acetylation seen with transfected  p <dig> was not influenced by the presence of mutant p <dig> in hucct- <dig> cells, we examined the effect of sprr2a over-expression in a cell line with  p <dig>  like hucct- <dig> cells, the human hepatoma cell line hepg <dig> does not express sprr2a  and hepg <dig> endogenous p <dig> is wild type
 <cit> . transient transfection of sprr2a in hepg <dig> cells resulted in a marked reduction of k-382-p <dig> acetylation and a corresponding reduction in p <dig> mrna , confirming a role for sprr2a in the acetylation and transactivation of p <dig> 

to determine if the sprr2a-induced p <dig> deacetylation was p <dig> dependent, we knocked down endogenous p <dig> expression with sirna . in both the vector control and sprr2a clone, removal of p <dig> resulted in an increase in total p <dig>  as previously reported
 <cit>  and is attributed to the role of p <dig> in the removal of p <dig> through ubiquitination and proteasomal targeting
 <cit> . in the vector control, loss of p <dig> causes a slight increase in ac-k382-p <dig>  but the ratio of ac-k382-p53/total p <dig> is maintained through compensatory p <dig> independent mechanisms . if sprr2a interferes with p <dig> acetylation solely through p <dig>  knocking out p <dig> should restore ac-k382-p <dig> levels to those seen in the sirna treated vector control. likewise, if sprr2a does not interfere with p <dig> acetylation of p <dig>  p <dig> knock down should not alter the ac-k382-p53/total p <dig> ratio seen in the clone.

results showed that p <dig> knock down in the sprr2a clone yielded a relative reduction in ac-k382-p <dig> when compared to the total p <dig> in the cell. this would occur if sprr2a reduces not only p <dig> directed acetylation of p <dig> , but also blocks the compensatory p <dig> independent pathway that maintains ac-k382-p53/total p <dig> levels in the vector control . the same change in ac-k382-p <dig> with ep <dig> sirna was obtained in two other stable sprr2a clones . p <dig> acetylation of p <dig> requires direct interaction between these two proteins and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that sprr2a expression inhibits p300-p <dig> binding .

we also considered that sprr2a might bind directly to p <dig> or p <dig> and interfere with subsequent acetylation, but immunoprecipitation experiments failed to show any direct interaction . consequently, the observed effect is likely upstream of these molecules.

altogether our observations suggest that sprr2a prevents acetylation of k382-p <dig> in two ways: the first involves p300: sprr2a dissociates or blocks p300-p <dig> binding, which in turn prevents acetylation of k382-p <dig> by p300; the second is p300-independent: sprr2a acts through other p <dig> regulators to reduce the activation/stabilization of p <dig>  since deacetylated p <dig> is less stable and more readily degraded, sprr2a stable clones have less total p <dig> , suggesting that sprr2a expression yields less ac-k382-p <dig> by enhancing ubiquitination and degradation.

sprr2a down-regulates p53-dna binding and target gene transcription
next, we determined whether sprr2a expression influences p <dig> dna binding activity using biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide probes that mimic the wild type or mutational sequences of known p <dig> binding motifs
 <cit> . lysates from hucct- <dig> parent cells, transfected with p <dig> vectors, show that p <dig> can bind with the intact, wild type p <dig> response element , but not the mutated re, indicating that p <dig> binding is sequence specific . over expression of p <dig> only slightly increased p <dig> binding to this element , most likely because the binding element is not in the context of the genome where dna conformation and upstream/downstream co-factor binding influences p <dig> binding. co-existent sprr2a expression in the protein lysate, however, decreased p <dig> binding to the element when compared to its corresponding control: p53 > p53/sprr2a; p53/p300 > p53/p300/sprr2a. furthermore, sprr2a significantly reduced this p53/re binding in the absence of p <dig> over expression, supporting a role for sprr2a in regulating p <dig> through non-p <dig> mechanisms . dna pull down assays using wild type p <dig> re motif did not show any direct binding of sprr2a, indicating that sprr2a does not act as a transcription factor that competes with p <dig> for binding to the response element . these results are in accordance with the above hypotheses suggesting that the effect of sprr2a on k382-p <dig> acetylation is what modulates p <dig> dna binding. 

these observations, however, still do not determine whether sprr2a and/or p300-mediated changes in p <dig> acetylation and dna-binding affect p <dig> target gene transcription. p <dig> regulates p <dig> gene expression by directly binding to a p53-re on the p <dig> promoter region
 <cit> , followed by recruitment of p300/cbp and acetylation of p53
 <cit> . we examined transcriptional activity using a luciferase reporter vector containing the p <dig> promoter. as shown in figure
2c, over expression of p <dig> in hucct- <dig> cells significantly increased the p <dig> promoter activity, as expected. in addition, this effect was increased by co-transfection with a wild type p <dig> vector, but in this reporter system it did not reach statistical significance. sprr2a expression decreased p <dig> promoter activity significantly, with and without p <dig> over expression, supporting previous data  showing that sprr2a affects not only p <dig>  but other p <dig> regulators as well. although less effective, a luciferase assay using p53-re-luc and its mutational construct demonstrated a similar reduction in activity after sprr2a expression . these results show that sprr2a can affect transcription not only on the p <dig> promoter, but on other promoters with a p53-re as well.

to corroborate the above hypothesis suggested by the luc-reporter assays, in vivo protein expression profiles were examined following similar transfections in parent hucct- <dig> . although the p21-luc reporter did not yield a significant increase in p <dig> transcription following combined p53/p <dig> transfection, figure
2d shows that transfection of both p <dig> and p <dig> increases p <dig> expression in vivo. furthermore, compared to wild type p <dig>  less ac-k83-p <dig> and p <dig> protein is expressed if Δch <dig> p <dig> is transfected. and finally, all p <dig> levels are reduced in the presence of sprr2a.

insights into how sprr2a interacts with p <dig> to inhibit p <dig> dna binding are seen in figure
2d. wild type-p <dig> is acetylated in hucct-1-parent cells, but sprr2a induction de-acetylated p <dig>  indicating a possible mechanism of sprr2a’s suppressive effect on p <dig> transcription . p <dig> protein can bind to both the ch <dig> and ch <dig> sites on p <dig>  but the binding sequences for each are different
 <cit> . the ch <dig> site interacts with many transcription factors, including p53
 <cit> . similar to sprr2a induction, transfection with a ch3-deleted p <dig> vector reduced promoter activity when compared to wild type p <dig> . and in accordance with the promoter assays, transfection with a ch3-deleted p <dig> vector also diminished the level of ac-k382-p <dig> and p <dig> . since ch3-deleted p <dig> protein was not acetylated, even in the absence of sprr2a in hucct- <dig> cells, the ch <dig> domain appears to be crucial for p <dig> acetylation followed by p <dig> acetylation . moreover, expression of sprr2a does not exert an additional suppressive effect on promoter activity in the ch3-deleted p <dig> expressing cells . this suggests that the effects of sprr2a  require a functional ch <dig> domain on p <dig> 

hdac <dig> reduces p <dig> acetylation in sprr2a cells
previous data from our lab showed that sprr2a functions as a sh <dig> domain ligand using its xpxxp motifs
 <cit>  and the p <dig> ch <dig> domain can bind to a xpxxp motif on p53
 <cit> . our initial hypothesis was that sprr2a contacts the ch <dig> domain of p <dig> and thereby precludes contact of p <dig> with other co-factors, like pcaf, thus preventing p <dig> acetylation. however, immunoprecipitation studies failed to reveal direct p300-sprr2a binding. this led us to determine whether other molecules might mediate the p <dig> and p <dig> deacetylation.

histone deacetylases do not act independently, but are recruited to complexes that regulate their deacetylase activity
 <cit> . gene array data showed that among the histone deacetylase superfamily, histone deacetylase  <dig>  was significantly upregulated in sprr2a over expressing cells . hdac <dig> was an attractive candidate molecule for sprr2a induced p <dig> deacetylation for the following reasons: 1) hdac <dig> affects p <dig> acetylation through interactions with both p300
 <cit>  and other cofactors such as mdm <dig> and msin3a
 <cit> ; 2) hdac <dig> acts as an antagonist of p <dig> in the regulation of p <dig> transcription
 <cit> ; 3) hdac <dig> is known to complex with factors that mediate p <dig> ubiquitination
 <cit> , targeting p <dig> for proteosomal degradation and reducing total cellular p <dig>  and; 4) hdac <dig> is required for tgf-β <dig> induced emt in hepatocytes
 <cit>  and sprr2a overexpression induces emt in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines
 <cit> .

to determine whether histone deacetylases mediate a reduction of ac-k382-p <dig> during sprr2a over-expression, we used the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a , which globally interferes with class i and ii deacetylase activity. tsa is a powerful inhibitor of deacetylase activity and treatment of sprr2a cells with tsa resulted in most all of the cellular p <dig> remaining in the acetylated form . this indicates that sprr2a-induced deacetylation of p <dig> can be reversed by class i/ii deacetylase inhibition and that it is not controlled by a tsa-resistant nad dependent histone deacetylase such as sirt <dig> 
 <cit> . 

we next verified gene array data for hdac <dig> by real time pcr and western blotting . over expression of hdac <dig> interfered with p <dig> activation by binding to the ch <dig> domain of p <dig> and competitively inhibiting p53-p <dig> interactions
 <cit> . since sprr2a-mediated p <dig> deacetylation and reduction of p <dig> expression required a functional p <dig> ch <dig> domain , we next determined whether hdac <dig> binds to p <dig> in our cells. as shown in figure
3c, endogenous hdac <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with p <dig>  because sprr2a cells over express hdac <dig>  there is more p300-hdac <dig> interaction, competitively inhibiting p53-p <dig> binding.

we next inhibited hdac <dig> expression using specific sirna to determine whether hdac <dig> was the specific deacetylase involved. western blots show that reducing hdac <dig> in sprr2a cells restores acetylated k382-p <dig> levels . additionally, knockdown of hdac <dig> recovered some p <dig> acetylation in sprr2a cells. this agrees with a previous report that showed the association of deacetylases with p <dig> regulates its own acetylation status
 <cit> . finally, we show that hdac <dig> sirna not only increases ac-k382-p <dig>  but it increases p <dig> mrna and protein expression , implicating this molecule in the sprr2a induced deacetylation of p <dig>  additionally, immunoprecipitation experiments determined that there were no direct hdac1/sprr2a protein interactions .

CONCLUSIONS
our algorithm for reduced p <dig> acetylation and target gene transcription during sprr2a over expression is outlined in figure
 <dig>  sprr2a induction of hdac <dig>  in combination with other cofactors, deacetylates ac-k382-p <dig> and targets the protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation . hdac <dig> also competes with p <dig> for binding to acetyltransferase p <dig>  reducing both p <dig> and p <dig> acetylation . although sprr2a does not bind directly to p <dig>  it might interfere with other cofactors involved with p <dig> autoacetylation. all molecular mechanisms for reduced p <dig> acetylation with sprr2a over expression are not known, but cannot be solely explained by increasing hdac1; further studies are needed.

finally, p53-dna binding is a critical event regulating gene expression during cellular stress, some of which might be disadvantageous during wound repair responses in barrier epithelia. for example, p <dig> transcriptional activation can trigger cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, dna repair, alter metabolism
 <cit>  and inhibit emt
 <cit> . sprr2a, in contrast, functions as a suppressor of p53-dependent transcriptional activity by reducing the levels of acetylated p <dig>  this deacetylation of p <dig> combined with the inherent antioxidant qualities of sprr
 <cit>  protects sprr2a expressing epithelial cells from damage and allows them to transiently acquire the mesenchymal characteristics needed for the restitution phase of wound repair.
