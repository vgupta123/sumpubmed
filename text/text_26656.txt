BACKGROUND
protein domains are fundamental units to study protein structure, conformation, function and evolution. a protein domain is generally defined as a structural unit which can fold independently and have their unique biological function  <cit> , while their identification usually relies on their property of being conserved in evolution  <cit> . the identification of structural domains has become more prominent to engineer protein properties by experimental means  <cit> , model protein structures using computational approaches  <cit>  and determine 3d structures using x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance   <cit> . especially, identification of stable structural domain is a crucial first step to generate novel synthetic antibodies  <cit> . for these reasons, many approaches have been suggested to identify structural domains. in earlier work, huang et al. implemented a method  to identify structured regions by excluding disordered regions  <cit> , thereby implicitly  detecting stably folded structures. also, a number of methods have been developed to identify protein structural domains: marsden et al. developed dompred that predicts structural domains using the alignment of predicted secondary structures of a given target against secondary structures of known domains  <cit> . a number of ab-initio methods have also been attempted to structural domains. they incorporated position specific physico-chemical properties of amino acids, amino acid composition, relative solvent accessibility, as well as evolutionary information in the form of sequence profiles  <cit> . while such approaches exist, there still is no efficient and integrative computational pipeline to identify structural domain for optimizing their likelihood of expression and folding. furthermore, a user-friendly webserver to predict these targets is not available.

to address this need, we developed an integrated computational framework, pat , that can predict optimal structural domains. pat automatically analyzes various structural properties, evaluates the folding stability, and identifies possible structured units in a given protein sequence. pat identifies two types of structured regions with reliable boundaries. the first are traditional domains, i.e. strongly conserved stretches of protein sequence that usually adopt compact folds that are annotated in usual databases such as pfam  <cit> . the others are putative structural units, i.e., parts of the protein that adopt stable folds but are not contained in current domain databases, presumably due to a lack of sequence conservation . for the identification of putative structural units, pat employs a novel scoring system by measuring the relevance of structural properties, integrating structural properties systematically, and generating target score that can represent folding stability of target molecules. pat also provides users with the results of each intermediate calculation, including residue-specific evolutionary rate, disorderness, secondary structure, presence of trans-membrane and signal peptide, hydrophobicity, antigenicity, and compilation of primary amino acid sequences homologous to the query that can help further analyses of the user’s proteins of interest.

in this study, to show the wide application of structural domain prediction, we applied pat to identify target molecules of synthetic antibodies. synthetic antibodies are invaluable tools for the recognition of specific protein targets and have numerous applications in clinical studies and biological science  <cit> . also, antibodies are applied to high-throughput proteome-wide studies to explore expression levels, subcellular localizations, and physical associations of target proteins  <cit> . it has been shown that proteins fragments that fold into stable structures are preferred as target molecules and consistently lead to high-affinity antibodies  <cit> . furthermore, these structural domains have been used as targets to produce affinity reagents and suitable constructs for antigen cell-surface display  <cit> . one of the major bottlenecks of synthetic antibody generation is the optimal identification and production of suitable antibody targets  since potential target proteins often fail to express or do not lead to high affinity binders  <cit> . in our proof-of-principle experiment, we showed that integrating structural properties of rna-binding proteins  can characterize protein regions that act as targets of synthetic antibodies  <cit> . in this study, we proved that pat can be broadly applied to all protein families and effectively identify structural domains that can be target molecules for synthetic antibody generation.

implementation
pat overview
pat is composed of two pipelines . one pipeline characterizes protein domains, which are structurally compact and independent folding units, and optimizes their boundaries. the other evaluates the folding stability of putative structural units that have stable folds but are not covered in current domain databases.fig.  <dig> a flow scheme of pat pipeline. a procedure to find protein domain regions. b procedure to find putative structural units. c identification of two types of structured units



identifying protein structured units
pat integrates four domain databases to identify protein domains . first, pat defines two types of domains : sequence-based domains  and structure-based domains . then, the sequence-based and structure-based domains are compared to find a consensus domain. we encounter three different cases: first, if one sequence-based domain maps to more than 50 % of one structure-based domain , the region that covers both types of domains is determined as a consensus domain. if several structure-based domains map to one sequence-based domain  or vice versa , the structure-based domain is considered as a consensus domain. if a given protein only contains sequence-based domain annotations, the sequence-based domain is selected.

identifying putative structural units
even in the absence of domain annotations, protein regions that show secondary structure, low levels of disorder, and sequence conservation in close species tend to adopt well-defined tertiary structures and can be appropriate target molecules for many areas of protein structure research as well as synthetic antibody generation . also, it has been shown that there is a positive correlation between soluble protein expressions yield and the number of contiguous hydrophobic residues and low complexity regions  <cit> . furthermore, such protein regions tend to have novel structural folds with uncharacterized function implying that generating antibodies against structural putative units can be the first step to elucidate biological roles of novel structural folds. we thus developed a novel prediction algorithm that combines those sequence/structure-related features and devised a target score that can help to evaluate folding stability and expression of putative structural units . for a given protein, pat compiles information on secondary structure, known domain, trans-membrane region, signal peptide, residue-specific evolutionary rate, antigenicity, disorderness, and hydrophobicity. in order to integrate the information of individual features into a target score, we evaluated the relevance of each feature  based on a grid-search over possible parameter space and optimized a scoring scheme. we did an exhaustive search of each feature weight and choose the set with optimum performance on the training set. as a training set, we used  <dig> proteins that have determined structures in the pdb database  <cit> , but do not have any domain annotations in pfam . we considered these structural regions  as a positive set and the rest of structural regions that do not have any structural information in  <dig> proteins  as a negative set. the area under the receiver operating characteristics  curve has been used to assess the performance of each combination of feature weights. the weights that yielded the best roc  are selected as the best weight combination. the optimized target score is; targetscore=disorderness× <dig> +secondarystructure× <dig> +sequenceconservation× <dig> +antigenicity× <dig> +hydrophobicity× <dig>  

this optimized score shows an area under the roc curve of  <dig> . this score reflects performance on the amino acid level . next, pat determines putative structural units that are enriched with high scoring residues. to do this, pat employs a density grid clustering algorithm  <cit> . first, pat divides the area of the protein into a number of “grids” of  <dig> residues and calculates an average target score of each grid. then, the grid that has the highest average target score is defined as the center of the putative structural unit. finally, the putative structural unit is extended as long as its target score is larger than a defined cut-off. at the target score cut-off of  <dig> , pat shows the best balanced accuracy , specificity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of sensitivity . we use all putative structural units of a minimum length of more than  <dig> residues. as a result, pat reports a set of structural domains including well-defined structural domains and putative structural units with their boundaries .

RESULTS
performance evaluation of pat
we evaluated pat predictions using three approaches. first, to ensure pat provides reliable structural domain boundaries that can lead to successful protein expression and purification  <cit> , we experimentally tested the efficiency of expression and purification of  <dig> predicted structural domains from pat . these  <dig> domains represent  <dig> structural families that show wide range of domain size  and sequence identity  distributions . the experimental results show that  <dig>  were correctly expressed and  <dig>  were successfully purified . meanwhile, from the large-scale protein structure initiative, targettrack  reported that among  <dig>  cloned targets,  <dig>   were expressed and  <dig>   were purified indicating that pat outperforms current large-scale expression efforts.table  <dig> comparative performance of pat and targettrack


aprotein domains were expressed in  <dig>  ml 2yt media at 30 °c overnight and the soluble his-tagged proteins were purified by affinity



second, we examined the performance to identify putative structural units using an independent set of  <dig> protein structures that are not used for the optimization of pat pipeline . the  <dig> proteins include  <dig> positions that are involved in putative structural regions  and  <dig> positions that do not have domain annotations and known structures . as shown in table  <dig>  pat correctly assigned  <dig> of  <dig> positive positions  and  <dig> of  <dig> negative positions . the pat has an accuracy of  <dig>  % and a precision of  <dig>  %. indeed, we found that pat can capture well-defined structures. for example, in death receptor  <dig> , the protein region ranging from f <dig> to d <dig> was predicted as a putative structural unit. when we mapped this predicted region onto the known protein structure , the region covered a folded structure that is composed of  <dig> helices . in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha , pat predicted the region ranging from v <dig> to r <dig> as a putative structural unit. this region is composed of two long helices forming a coiled-coil . furthermore, we computed the target scores of unexpressed constructs in targettrack  as these would correspond to a proteins that are difficult to express and thus likely not stably folded. we then compared these scores with the scores of  <dig> known putative structural units . as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the average target score of our set is about two times higher than the score of unexpressed targets with high statistical significance . it suggests that pat can identify appropriate structural units that would be well expressed and purified.table  <dig> performance of pat to identify putative structural units

next, we compared predicted targets from pat with known experimental constructs that are used for synthetic antibody generation. from an in-house pipeline for the generation of synthetic antibodies, we received the sequences of  <dig> experimentally characterized constructs that are part of protein structures and against which antibodies were successfully produced using phage display . we found that pat can correctly identify these target molecules. of  <dig> constructs, pat correctly predicted  <dig>  with a reciprocal overlap greater than 70 % .fig.  <dig> distribution of the reciprocal overlap between pat prediction and known experimental constructs that produce synthetic antibodies



for a comparative performance evaluation of pat predictions, we also applied dismeta  <cit>  and dompred  <cit>  to these  <dig> experimentally characterized constructs . we found that pat outperforms the other two methods. only  <dig> constructs  and  <dig> constructs  have a reciprocal overlap  with dismeta and dompred, respectively. also, the overall reciprocal overlap of pat  is about  <dig>  times higher than overlaps of dismeta  and dompred .

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of high quality protein structural domains is a necessary prerequisite for protein engineering, protein structure determination and successful antibody generation. pat is an effective tool to find potential structural domains by adapting a novel integrative scoring scheme and has been shown to do so efficiently. we believe that pat has great practical value to researches focusing on large-scale structured target production and will ultimately improve the success rate for synthetic antibody generation and follow up studies.
