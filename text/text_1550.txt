BACKGROUND
in the basic sir model for infectious disease  <cit> , a population is divided into susceptible , infected  and resistant  sub-populations, and the spread of infectious disease in that population is calculated on the assumption of homogeneous mixing of the individuals, so that there is a fixed probability of contact between any two individuals. this model cannot be applied to disease spread between cattle farms, since they do not mix homogeneously and it is therefore essential to allow for the spatial distribution of farms, for example by controlling the probability of disease transmission between two farms by a function of their geographical proximity  <cit> . however, geographical proximity is not the only factor that may influence disease spread. trade between farms creates a new topology in mapping disease risk. a more precise control of the probability of transmission could use the actual  contacts between farms to build a contact network. contact networks have been used in simulations of human disease , with the contact between two individuals being taken as persistent. for uk cattle farms, contact data is available in the form of the cattle movement database provided by the british cattle movement service . because trade links are sporadic, movements are not well modelled as persistent contacts  <cit> , and the temporal pattern of movements has important implications for the spread of infectious diseases. for structural studies of the cattle contact networks, movements have been regarded as quasi-persistent by considering the contacts resulting from movements during a relatively short period  to be persistent through that period . such networks can yield information relevant to non-persistent networks if they are considered ergodic  <cit> . disease simulations have been carried out with a true temporal component, using a replay of the actual movements over a defined period  <cit> . here, we attempt to use the bcms movement data to build a network that incorporates the temporal sequence of movements between cattle premises, so that the structural features of such a network can be determined, and so that disease simulations can be run with less computational effort. the fundamental feature of our networks is that the nodes are not cattle farms but are instead movements between cattle farms . thus nodes have three basic properties: the source location, the target location, and the date of the movement. for simplicity, the number of animals moved is not included in the node definition. edges  between nodes only exist when the target in one node is the source, in another node, of a movement on the same or a later date . a further refinement is to include the type of each location  and to limit the time that may elapse after the first movement before the second movement is no longer linked to it. the time limit depends on the type of the linking location. we used the bcms data for the whole of  <dig> and  <dig>  the time limits for links involving farms were  <dig> days  or  <dig> days  .

RESULTS
networks for structural investigations
nodes and edges
the total number of movements available as nodes for the networks was  <dig> , <dig>  a larger proportion of the available nodes became connected to at least one other node in the 14-day infection network . the 14-day infection network had  <dig> , <dig> edges, 5% more edges than the 7-day infection network . unless otherwise stated, the following results exclude nodes that are not connected to any other node.

components
a weak component of a network with directed edges  is a part of the network in which each node is connected to all the other nodes, along paths of edges ignoring the direction of the edges  <cit> . a strong component in such a network is similar, but with the direction of the edges respected  <cit> . the 7-day infection network has  <dig>  weak components of  <dig> nodes, but the frequency of components of a given size drops off exponentially with increasing size and the largest minor weak component has  <dig> nodes. in this network,  <dig> % of the connected nodes are actually in the giant weak component . the 14-day infection network has  <dig>  weak components of  <dig> nodes, the largest minor weak component is  <dig> nodes, and  <dig> % of the connected nodes are in the giant weak component . the directed structure of the networks makes strong components uninteresting. the theoretical maximum size of a strong component in a network of this kind is  <dig> 

in- and out-degree
the maximum out-degree is the same for both networks , while the maximum in-degree is higher for the 14-day infection network . the distributions of in-degree frequencies for both networks exhibit regions that correspond to scale-free networks, but the regions are small . for low in-degrees  the plot shows a scale-free profile which then flattens out to a characteristic frequency of approximately  <dig> up to in-degree  <dig>  this is followed by an abrupt fall in frequency of nodes with high in-degree. out-degree plots are similar, but more curvilinear in the first region . some of the anomalies are the result of the different behaviour of different types of locations. when in-degree is plotted only for movements from farms , and out-degree for movements to farms , then more typically scale-free distributions are seen . similar frequency plots for movements from and to markets only  are very unlike scale-free distributions . two-dimensional degree distributions reveal that very few nodes have both a high in- and out-degree, and that most have a low value for both .

dyad and triad censuses
mutual dyads can only occur when reciprocal movements between two locations are made on the same day. such events are rare, but logically occur in equal numbers in the two networks. the reciprocity of both the 7-day infection and 14-day infection networks is low . similarly, in the triad census  <cit> ,  <dig> and 030c triads  are same-day events and have the same count in both networks. 030c triads are rare, and are the only triangles found, so the clustering coefficients are low . it is noteworthy that the triads 030t,  <dig>  120d, 120u, 120c,  <dig> and  <dig> are all forbidden by the rules for connecting nodes, and all yield zero counts in the partial triad censuses. these triads are shown with pale blue nodes in fig.  <dig> 

disease simulations
as described in methods, for each of the networks,  <dig> disease simulations were run for each value of the parameter, q, which represents the probability of transmission of infection along an edge of the network from an infected node. these simulations were run, starting from a randomly-selected node, for  <dig> steps. the range and median of time spans represented by  <dig> steps is shown below for each network. the results of varying q on each network are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> as the peak number of infected movements, the maximum number of movements infected within a simulation, and the maximum number of steps before extinction of the infection , each collected over  <dig> simulations.

max peak infected is the peak number of infected movements on any one step of a simulation; max cumulative is the maximum cumulative number of movements infected within a simulation; max steps or final % is the maximum number of steps before extinction of the infection . each is the maximum over  <dig> simulations.

discussion
while contact networks were a considerable step forward in the spatial modelling of disease spread, a simple structure of locations connected by the historical existence of cattle movements is not a good model of the temporal structure of these movements. we have viewed the movement data from a different perspective, using the movements as the nodes, which incorporate spatial relationships, and connecting them according to temporal criteria.

our approach could be described as a heavily modified line-graph. a line-graph is a graph derived from an original network graph in the following way: each edge in the original graph becomes a node of the line-graph, and where two edges in the original graph share a node in common, their corresponding nodes in the line-graph are connected by an edge  <cit> . if our networks are regarded as derived from some notional static networks of locations and the movements between them, then they are line-graphs rendered much less dense by the application of our temporal sequencing rules, which use information not present in the notional static networks. we have found that the line-graph concept has been used before in epidemiological network models  <cit> . in that work, on human sexually-transmitted diseases , the static network consisted of sexually-active individuals as nodes with sexual relationships as undirected edges. as part of the calculations on the concurrency of such contacts, a full line-graph was constructed. all std simulations were run on the static network, with some parameters derived from the line-graph. in our case, the static network is purely notional, the edges within it would be directed, and the derived line-graph would be heavily edited on the basis of temporal data. we then run our disease simulations on this derived network. our approach might be beneficially used on the std model.

there are concerns about the appropriateness of the bcms movement data as the basis of a contact network. doubts have been expressed about the accuracy and completeness of the records  <cit> , and it is clear that some categories of movement are not recorded at all  <cit> . it is also necessary to consider other forms of contact between cattle farms that carry the risk of transmitting infection, such as vehicle movements and shared equipment  <cit> . in one recent study, these factors not involving cattle movements were found to be a minor component of a full contact network, whereas unrecorded movements on and off shared grazing were more important . we have analysed the bcms data, but a similar analysis could be carried out with any contact list, for example one expanded from bcms data to include other movements and other forms of contact.

the time slice of bcms data analysed here  was chosen as the largest stable and coherent full calendar year segment from the data available to us. earlier data was more fragmentary and was distorted by the fmd outbreak in  <dig>  the data for  <dig> was incomplete. we chose to limit the length of time that an infected location remained infectious, and used the data on lengths of stays to determine appropriate limits for all-in, all-out operations. for farms, we selected limits within the period that an infection might remain undetected, and chose  <dig> and  <dig> days as these corresponded to peaks in the frequency of interval lengths between movements on and off farms presumably reflecting the weekly periodicity of farming practice or at least of reporting. these interval lengths are also of sufficient duration to be beyond the effects of the 6-day stand-still rule for uk cattle movements.

the 7-day and 14-day infection networks contain a high proportion of the available nodes , with just over 98% of these connected nodes in a single giant weak component, in both networks. the method of construction of the networks means that the maximum size for a strong component is only  <dig> nodes. it also means that mutual dyads and triangles are uncommon , and that  <dig> of the  <dig> triad classes are missing altogether. all these expectations are confirmed by the analyses. the networks, therefore, consist principally of asymmetric edges, all directed down a time line. the densities are low, as might be expected on a large network. the average in –  degree for the nodes in 7- and 14-day infection networks are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

the log-log plots of frequency of in-degree  show only small areas of scale-free behaviour, a type of network structure that has been of particular interest to epidemiologists because infections can spread on a scale-free network without an epidemic threshold  <cit> . out-degree plots  show no scale-free regions. the patterns seen in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> reflect the heterogeneity of the cattle-holding location types in the data used to construct the networks. the low degree region is mostly populated by movements off farms  and on to farms , as is shown for the 7-day infection network in fig.  <dig>  these movements show more classically scale-free behaviour. for movements that  involve markets, however, the plots do not correspond to the scale-free profile , but show a characteristic frequency in the region corresponding to the region  <dig> of figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  and an abrupt fall in frequency in the third region. what these figures show in common is a marked heterogeneity of both in- and out-degree, which has been demonstrated, on undirected networks at least, to correspond to very rapid spreading of simulated epidemics  <cit> .

the structural features determined for these networks, such as dyad and triad censuses and 2-dimensional degree distributions, could form the basic data for algorithms to produce generic networks representing uk cattle movements. generic networks may be constructed such that the resulting network fits a set of structural criteria. for example, large networks may be rapidly constructed based on a particular two-dimensional degree distribution and dyad census, using a shuffling and re-wiring process  <cit> .

for the disease simulations on the 7-day and 14-day infection networks, a run of  <dig> steps was used, as this gave effective time spans that covered several infectious periods , but less than half the time span of the data, allowing the possibility that some epidemics will be completed before reaching the end of the data. the value of the transmission probability  is regarded as a sensitive parameter in disease simulation  <cit> . the q values chosen ran from  <dig> , which would maximise the scope of the epidemic, down to  <dig> , where the maximum epidemic size was less than  <dig> % of the maximum for q =  <dig> . for each set of conditions,  <dig> simulations were run so that the maxima reported contain low frequency outcomes.

we found  <dig> possible outcomes from a simulation, as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and figs.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  which depend on the probability of transmission of infection and the structure of the network. at low q, the epidemic extinguishes quickly . as q increases, the epidemic can maintain itself longer and is still not extinguished by the end of the data in a proportion of simulations . at higher q  in the 14-day infection network, the epidemic reaches the movements at the end of the time period captured by the network, and thus extinguishes abruptly. the maximum epidemic sizes for q =  <dig> were  <dig> % and  <dig> % of available nodes for the 7-day and 14-day infection networks, respectively. these results were obtained from arbitrary start points in the network. for smaller networks of this type, more efficient use of the available data might be achieved by selecting start nodes near the beginning of the time slice, with due allowance for differences in the movement pattern on different days of the week and in different seasons  <cit> .

the simulation results are expressed in dynamic terms, as the object of study is the movement, not the holding, and we believe this provides a suitable way of viewing the vulnerability of the system. however, it might be of interest to know how the results translate into numbers of infected farms. the network structure we describe here does not allow the tracking of individual holdings during our disease simulations, which are only intended to be proof of concept. if such tracking were required, the adjacency list representing the network would have to be augmented with an extra parameter for each node pair to indicate the identity of the holding where the second movement terminated, and specialised software would have to be written to use this tracking information. with generic networks, rather than those directly derived from movement data, such tracking of holdings would not be possible. in the absence of such sophistications of network and software, we can suggest a rule of thumb for converting the number of infected movements into the number of infected farms. we start with the observation that 44% of the movements for  <dig> and  <dig> end at farms. in the case of the simulation on the 7-day infection network with probability of transmission  equal to  <dig>  the maximum cumulative total of infected movements is   <dig>  , so  <dig>  terminate at a farm. as  <dig> million farms were in use in  <dig> plus  <dig>  it is conceivable that all these are "new"  farms, but knowledge of the industry and knowledge of the database, supported by a replay experiment, suggest that the proportion of new farms is much lower, perhaps 10–25%. the replay experiment uses a technique similar to one published for foot and mouth disease simulation  <cit> , but independently derived , in which the movements through the period are replayed in temporal sequence to follow the transmission of disease from an arbitrary infected holding. using comparable conditions to those in the example under discussion , the maximum cumulative total of infected farms was  <dig>  . our rule of thumb, therefore, is that the maximum cumulative number of infected farms is 5–10% of the maximum cumulative total of infected movements. for our largest simulated "epidemic" ) this suggests up to  <dig>  farms might be infected, whereas for our smallest ) the maximum might be as low as  <dig> farms.

the simulation results indicate that networks constructed in this way may be used to efficiently test disease transmission scenarios on the uk cattle industry, avoiding the need to develop dynamic network models.

CONCLUSIONS
these networks incorporate spatial relationships, in common with other contact networks, but also incorporate temporal relationships. the structures include a giant weak component, and some unusual features resulting from the lack of strong components greater than  <dig> nodes. the variety of location types in the underlying location population leads to non-scale-free degree distributions. the simple simulations of the spread of infection on the networks indicate that there are typical behaviours, such as extinction of an epidemic at low infectivity but persistence at high infectivity. we conclude that networks built with movements as nodes could be used for analysis and for simulation to give a new insight into the spread of infection in the uk cattle herd.
