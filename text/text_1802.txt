BACKGROUND
monoterpenes represent a prominent group of volatile organic compounds , with an estimated mean global emission of  <dig> tg c yr- <dig> into the atmosphere
 <cit>  and a fast photochemical turnover
 <cit> . especially coniferous plants are considered to be main producers of monoterpenes, e.g. for thermotolerance or for communication between plants or the interaction between plants and insects
 <cit> . monoterpenes also enter the soil by the rhizosphere or by rotten leafs
 <cit> , where they inhibit growth of microorganisms as well as of seedlings
 <cit> , but also stimulate the bacterial activity detectable in higher biomass and co2-production
 <cit> . by definition, monoterpenes possess a carbon skeleton based on two c <dig> units originating from isopentenyl pyrophosphate , which is synthesized via the mevalonate  or the mevalonate-independent pathway 
 <cit> . mainly, plant monoterpenes are produced via the latter pathway, but the metabolic cross linkage between both has been reported in several species
 <cit> .

monoterpenes are together with sesquiterpenes the major constituents of essential oils. due to their status – they are generally recognized as safe 
 <cit>  - and their odorous properties, these substances are widespread in the food, cosmetics, flavour and fragrance industry
 <cit> . monoterpenes are utilized as energy and carbon source by several aerobic microorganisms, a fact known since the 1960s
 <cit> . most reports dealt with pseudomonas species, e.g.
 <cit> , but also bacillus stearothermophilus <cit> , rhodococcus erythropolis <cit> , and enterobacter cowanii <cit>  metabolize these hydrocarbons. the microbial degradation of α-pinene and limonene, one of the most widespread monoterpenes in nature, involve complex and multiple pathways that comprise in large part oxidation reactions
 <cit> . in addition these studies revealed the importance of oxygenases, which catalyze hydroxylation reactions with molecular oxygen as co-substrate
 <cit> .

under anaerobic conditions, the biochemistry for the activation of these natural abundant alkenes seems to follow a totally different mechanism. the first evidence for the anaerobic degradation of monoterpenes were seven nitrate-reducing enrichment cultures with monoterpenes as sole carbon source
 <cit> . isolation led to the description of four alcaligenes defragrans strains, including strain 65phen isolated with α-phellandrene
 <cit> . a taxonomic study transferred these strains in the novel genus castellaniella within the alcaligenaceae, as c. defragrans <cit> . the betaproteobacterium is capable of degrading a broad substrate range of a-, mono-, and bicyclic monoterpenes 
 <cit> . initial metabolite studies on the anaerobic monoterpene degradation pathway in c. defragrans elucidated the demand for a sp2-hybridized c1-atom as structural prerequisite for monoterpenes utilization
 <cit>  as well as the formation of geranic acid as intermediate
 <cit> , which is likely degraded on a modified β-oxidation pathway
 <cit> . these findings proposed the degradation of β-myrcene via hydration to linalool, followed by isomerisation to geraniol, and then two oxidations to geranial and to geranic acid
 <cit> . the genes and proteins involved this pathway were recently identified
 <cit>  . the bifunctional linalool dehydratase-isomerase ldi/ldi catalyzes the first two steps, the highly enantiospecific hydration of β-myrcene to --linalool and its isomerisation to geraniol
 <cit> . subsequently, two dehydrogenases oxidize the allylalcohol geraniol and geranial. the geraniol dehydrogenase geoa/gedh  is a member of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily
 <cit>  with high affinity for its substrate geraniol
 <cit> . in vitro studies confirmed the activity of a geranial dehydrogenase geob/gadh. both dehydrogenases were expressed in cells growing with monoterpenes
 <cit> . 

so far, the evidence for the anaerobic β-myrcene degradation pathway was rather biochemically based on metabolite and enzyme studies. to prove the physiological role in vivo, we created deletion mutants of c. defragrans missing the gene ldi and geoa, respectively. the previous findings, i.e. the geranic acid formation and the induced dehydrogenase activities, were observed in both acyclic and monocyclic monoterpenes grown cells and suggested the existence of a common degradation pathway. to clarify whether there is one defined metabolic route or multiple pathways present for the anaerobic degradation of monoterpenes in c. defragrans, we deleted the initial, β-myrcene-activating enzyme, the ldi. the deletion of the gedh was of interest due to the frequent presence of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases in genomes, often with a broad substrate range.

RESULTS
construction of the in-frame deletion mutant c. defragrans Δldi and Δgeoa
growth of c. defragrans as single colony under denitrifying conditions was achieved on acetate in a defined, solidified medium. a spontaneous mutant strain resistant to rifampicin  was obtained showing the phenotype of the wildtype with respect to growth on monoterpenes . conjugation was established with the broad host range plasmid pbbr1mcs- <dig>  proceeding with a frequency of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> transconjugants cell/ donor cells in 8 h . the plasmid was maintained in c. defragrans. for genomic deletion mutants, we constructed pk19mobsacbΔldi and pk19mobsacbΔgeoa that carried the start and stop codon of the ldi  or geoa  separated by a specific restriction site and the upstream and downstream located regions . the sequence information was obtained from a 50 kb contig  with the following annotation for orfs adjacent to ldi or geoa: orf <dig> as a thioesterase, orf <dig> as a putative subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, orf <dig> as a secretory protein and orf <dig> as a long-chain-fatty-acid coa ligase, while for orf <dig> only hypothetical proteins were found in database queries . conjugation and homologous recombination yielded genomic in-frame deletions, with a second recombination frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the deletion of ldi and of geoa, respectively. analysis by pcr revealed in the deletion mutants the expected, shortened amplicons with primer pairs spanning the deleted gene in comparison with the wild type . polar effects due to the deletion of ldi or geoa were not detected in mrna analyses . the genes ldi or geoa and their native ribosomal binding site were cloned in the mcs of pbbr1mcs plasmids. conjugation into c. defragrans deletion mutants yielded ampicillin-resistant transconjugants named c. defragrans Δldicomp and kanamycin-resistant transconjugants named c. defragrans Δgeoacomp.

physiological characterization of c. defragrans Δldi
under standard culturing conditions for anaerobic, denitrifying growth with 10 mm nitrate and 4 mm cyclic α-phellandrene or limonene in  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> ,8-heptamethylnonane , c. defragrans strains 65phen, Δldi, and Δldicomp grew to final od ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . c. defragrans strains 65phen metabolized the acyclic β-myrcene, but c. defragrans Δldi lacking the gene for the ldi failed to grow with this substrate . the in trans complementation Δldicomp restored the wild type phenotype. these data showed that the ldi is essential for the metabolism of β-myrcene, but not for the cyclic monoterpenes α-phellandrene and limonene.

in previous studies, β-myrcene as well as α-phellandrene supported the formation of geranic acid in cell suspension experiments. the geranic acid pool was 10fold larger in β-myrcene experiments than with the cyclic monoterpenes α-pinene, α-phellandrene, and limonene
 <cit> . we assayed the geranic acid pools in c. defragrans mutant strains under nitrate-limited conditions in liquid cultures on 6 mm monoterpene in hmn . this metabolite was only detectable in myrcene-grown c. defragrans cultures with the ldi either present in the genome or in trans, in concentrations of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively. in α-phellandrene grown cultures, geranic acid was detectable in media of these c. defragrans strains in concentrations of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm. geranic acid formation was not detectable in cultures of the mutant lacking the gene ldi. the rp-hplc detection limit was  <dig>  nm, thus geranic acid formation in c. defragrans Δldi was below a thousandth of that in the wild type. growth on α-phellandrene clearly does not involve the formation of geranic acid suggesting the presence of another monoterpene degrading pathway that circumvents the activation of the substrate by ldi as well as geranic acid formation. 

c. defragrans cultures were grown in  <dig> ml with  <dig> mm α-phellandrene or β-myrcene and  <dig> mm nitrate at 30°c and  <dig> rpm. inoculum size was 1% . duplicate determination. detection limit for geranic acid was  <dig>  nm. n.d. = not detectable.

under aerobic conditions microbial biotransformation of -limonene and β-myrcene revealed the formation of enantiopure -perillyl alcohol, perillyl acid and myrcenic acid
 <cit> . anaerobic hydroxylations catalyzed by molybdenum enzymes have been recently reported, e.g. the hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to -phenylethanol in aromatoleum aromaticum <cit>  and of cholesterol to cholest- <dig> -diene-3-one in sterolibacterium denitrificans <cit> . whether the degradation of cyclic monoterpenes proceeds via a homologue pathway is subjected in ongoing research. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the existence of different activation mechanisms for cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes in one bacterial strain.

physiological and enzymatic characterization of c. defragrans Δgeoa
the deletion of geoa resulted in an increased generation time and reduced biomass yields, e.g. on α-phellandrene, limonene and β-myrcene . nitrate was completely consumed, but the generation time was always prolonged, e.g.  <dig> -fold for α-phellandrene. the biomass formed as determined by protein analyses was decreased by 32% to 48% in the deletion mutant . most likely, geraniol was oxidized at slower rate in the deletion mutant. this seems to have an inhibitory effect on the growth due to the known geraniol in vivo toxicity of above 5 μm in the aqueous phase
 <cit> . the intracellular geraniol concentrations were below the detection threshold of gas chromatographical analysis, but we observed physiological evidence for increased geraniol pools. in the cultivation system with hmn, 4 mm geraniol stopped monoterpene utilization completely
 <cit> . in the wild type, addition of 16 mm acetate supported growth in the presence of 4 mm geraniol and 20 mm nitrate to an od <dig> of  <dig>  . the deletion mutant c. defragans Δgeoa also grew after acetate addition, but reached only an od <dig> of  <dig>  , although both strains consumed the same nitrate amount. in conclusion, c. defragans Δgeoa reacts more sensitive towards geraniol than the wild type. 

c. defragrans strains 65phen , Δgeoa and Δgeoacomp were grown under standard conditions at 28°c for 280 h  or for 304 h  with 4 mm monoterpene  and 10 mm nitrate. as negative control served a culture without inoculum.

the growth phenotype of the wild type was recovered in the mutant strain by complementation with the geoa gene located on a broad-host range plasmid. the in trans complemented mutant c. defragrans Δgeoacomp revealed physiological characteristics similar to c. defragrans 65phen: growth rate and yield, monoterpene consumption and nitrate reduction were almost identical suggesting that the wild type phenotype was restored by gedh constitutively expressed from the plasmid pbbr1mcs-2geoa .

the absence of gedh was expected to reduce the rate of geranic acid formation. in this study, geranic acid was detected in cultures grown on 6 mm monoterpene in the presence of hmn and 10 mm nitrate . cultures were sampled after nitrate depletion. geranic acid concentrations of acidified and lysed cultures were 9 ± 1 μm in the medium of the wild type and 12 ± 1 μm in the medium of the complemented mutant, but only 5 ± 2 μm in the medium of c. defragrans Δgeoa, thus revealing a limited capacity to form geranic acid in the absence of gedh.

the Δgeoa phenotype has still the capacity to degrade monoterpenes, an indication for the presence of another alcohol dehydrogenase that catalyzes the geraniol oxidation. thus, we tested the gedh activity spectrophotometrically in cell-free, cytosolic extracts of c. defragrans strains 65phen, Δgeoa and Δgeoacomp. under standard conditions, with  <dig>  mm geraniol as substrate and identical protein concentrations in the assay, the geraniol oxidation rates were  <dig>  nkat mg- <dig> protein for c. defragrans 65phen and  <dig>  nkat mg- <dig> protein for c. defragrans Δgeoa. complementation restored the activity to  <dig>  nkat mg- <dig> protein in c. defragrans Δgeoacomp. the in vivo concentration of geraniol inside the cell is expected to be in the micromolar range
 <cit> . the gedh activity in the extracts of c. defragrans Δgeoa catalyzed the reaction with a high affinity, the apparent concentration for half-maximal rate was below 10 μm geraniol . this indicated an activity of the second alcohol dehydrogenase at physiological conditions. 

in summary, the presented data argue for a reduced geraniol flux to geranic acid in the metabolism of the deletion mutant. we suggest that a geraniol accumulation or increased pools of metabolites derived from geraniol on other pathways cause a reduced growth rate as indicated by prolonged generation time, decreased biomass production, and reduced geranic acid formation. the accumulation of a toxic intermediate in monoterpene catabolism causing reduced growth rate has also been seen for deletion mutants of p. putida m <dig> in ß-myrcene degradation
 <cit> . accumulation of geraniol is known to be toxic for cells: due to its hydrophobic properties it can integrate into bacterial membranes causing disintegrations followed by failure of the proton motive force
 <cit> .

the presence of several adhs in a genome is not unusual. in microorganisms, alcohol dehydrogenases possess a wide variety of substrate specificities and are involved in different physiological functions
 <cit> . for various adhs deficient mutants, retarded growth on the prevailing substrate and reduced adh activity was observed
 <cit> . also in plants the existence of additional adhs capable of oxidizing geraniol was suggested
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a genetic system for castellaniella defragrans and constructed in-frame deletion mutants that allows for insights into the physiology of the anaerobic degradation of monoterpenes.

c. defragrans Δgeoa lacking the gene for a geraniol dehydrogenase was physiologically analysed. the geoa deficient strain exhibited reduced growth on monoterpenes and slower geraniol oxidation rates in soluble extracts, in comparison to the wild type. the original phenotype was restored in trans with an episomal geoa in the c. defragrans Δgeoacomp. one explanation for the reduced growth is a higher steady-state level of geraniol in the cell causing toxic effects. these observations together with reduced geranic acid formation demonstrate clearly a participation of gedh in the anaerobic degradation of β-myrcene. however, the geoa deletion is not mortal. a second gedh activity is present in soluble extracts. this suggests a need for both gedhs to balance the geraniol formation by oxidation during fast growth of the wild type.

the physiological characterization regarding growth with acyclic and cyclic monoterpenes exhibited an unexpected effect of the ldi deletion that caused a phenotype dependent on the substrate structure in c. defragrans Δldi: the cyclic monoterpenes α-phellandrene and limonene were metabolized, but not the acyclic β-myrcene. thus, the degradation of the acyclic β-myrcene required the activity of a linalool dehydratase-isomerase that was not necessary for the degradation of cyclic monoterpenes. this observation indicates for the presence of a second hydrocarbon activating system in c. defragrans.
