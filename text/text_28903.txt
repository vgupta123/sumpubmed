BACKGROUND
the genome of an organism plays a central role in the control of cellular processes such as genetic regulation, metabolic pathway, and signal transduction. because these processes are very complex and comprised of many genetic interacting elements, it is hard to discover those interacting elements in the complex biological regulations. since microarray technique allows researchers to simultaneously observe the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single experiment, there have been many studies to discover global genetic regulation from microarray gene expression data by using various computational methods to uncover the hidden roles of genetic elements, such as clustering techniques to identify clusters of co-expressed genes  <cit> , network inference techniques to construct the genome-wide regulatory network models  <cit> .

one of the most challenging problems in analyzing gene expression data is to determine how the expression of any particular gene might affect the expression of other genes. to find the relationships among different genes, an association rule mining  method has been applied to gene expression data set because the method can identify associations among genes even when the genes are not co-expressed  <cit> . an association rule has the form lhs  → rhs , where lhs and rhs are sets of items, and it represents that the rhs set being likely to occur whenever the lhs set occurs. in case of analyzing gene expression data, the items in an association rules are represented as genes, which are highly expressed or highly repressed. an example of an association rule from gene expression data might be  → , which represents that when gene a is measured as highly expressed and gene b is highly repressed then it is also likely to observe and gene c is highly expressed. from the result of the arm method, it is possible to discover interactions between correlated expressions of genes in microarray experiments. despite of the usefulness of arm  <cit> , the time dependency between associated genes cannot be extracted by using the conventional arm method even though the temporal information is indispensable to discover regulation mechanisms.

previous studies, which identify time-dependent regulatory relations among genes can be grouped into two general categories. the first approach constructs cellular dynamic models to observe the response of cells by using dynamic bayesian network   <cit>  and ordinary differential equation . however, these approaches have fundamental problems: they need a huge amount of computational time to infer the temporal dependency among genes and show relatively low accuracies analyzing in microarray gene expression data  <cit> . these drawbacks are mainly caused by the fact that the currently available time-series microarray data is not suited for such complex models of genetic regulation. most of microarray gene expression data sets have relatively small number of experiments compared to the number of genes and they have relatively large regular time intervals between experiment time points. the second approach identifies pair-wise temporal dependency between genes by clustering with local patterns of gene expression  <cit> , by measuring the pearson correlation coefficient of two genes, by detecting the major changes in expression level  <cit> , by scoring the expression patterns with several defined events  <cit> , and by matching the expression patterns with shifted patterns  <cit> . although such methods can identify pair-wise temporal relations, it cannot identify combinatorial temporal relations which are regarded an important characteristic of regulation  <cit> . for example, the meaning of  →  , and  →   'and'  →   is completely different: in the case of  →  , gene a and gene b play a role as combinatorial regulators in a single regulation. on the other hand,  →   and  →  , gene a and gene b are independent regulators.

even though there are some previous studies related to extraction of association rules from time series data in other application domains  <cit> , they do not provide temporal dependencies among items within different time . to address the problem, we propose a new mining method for gene expression data sets, which can extract temporal dependency among genes by applying temporal association rule mining  method. the temporal association rules represent various transcriptional time delays between associated genes. an example of a temporal association rule is  →  , which represents that high expression level of gene a and significant repression of gene b followed by significant expression of gene c after  <dig> minutes. hence, the temporal association rule can tell us the size of transcriptional time delay  between associated genes , activation and inhibition relationship , and sets of co-regulators .

the overall process of the proposed method is depicted in figure  <dig>  the proposed method consists of two main phases. first, temporal association rule mining phase. with an obtained fitted parameter set, the steps of temporal association mining method is applied to time-series gene expression data:  converting gene expression values into discrete values,  generating temporal transaction sets with various sizes of transcriptional time delay Δ,  generating temporal frequent item sets,  and finally, extracting temporal association rules. the proposed method is tested with public microarray experiments of saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle alpha factor arrest synchronization data set. second, parameters fitting phase. in this phase, external known regulation information  is used to choose the best parameter set from all possible combinations of parameter sets. three parameters are selected for the proposed temporal association rule mining  method. among every possible combination of three parameter values, the best parameter set that has the highest overlap degree with previously known biological regulation relationships is selected as the fitted parameter set.

methods
conventional association rule mining 
to explain the basic concepts of association rule mining, we use the definitions and the examples of supermarket data shown in  <cit> . consider a small store that sells the following set of items: . list of items bought by six hypothetical customers are shown in table  <dig>  this table will be used to illustrate the concepts presented in this section.

definition 1
 an association rule is a pair of disjoint item sets. if lhs  and rhs  denote the two disjoint item sets, the association rule is written as lhs → rhs.

 the support of the association rule lhs → rhs with respect to a transaction set t is the support of the item set lhs ∪ rhs with respect to t.

 the confidence of the rule lhs → rhs with respect to a transaction set t is the ratio support /support.

example
consider the item sets a <dig> =  and a <dig> = . since a <dig> and a <dig> are disjoint, a <dig> → a <dig>  is an association rule. let r <dig> denote this association rule. the support of r <dig> is the support of the item set . from table  <dig>  it can be seen that this support value is  <dig>  also from table  <dig>  the support of the item set  is  <dig>  therefore, the confidence of rule r <dig> is 4/ <dig> or  <dig> %.

temporal association rule mining 
in this work, we propose a temporal association rule mining  method, which is based on apriori algorithm. following two sub-sections will explain the detailed methodology of temporal association rule mining phase ), and parameter fitting phase ).

to explain the concept of the proposed tarm method, we first define new terminologies.

definition 2
 a temporal item is an item, which has a time stamp.

 a temporal item set Ï is a non-empty set of temporal items.

 given a temporal item set Ï, a set t of transactions on Ï, and a positive integer α, Ï is a temporal frequent item set with respect to t and α if support t  > = α. 

 a temporal association rule is a pair of disjoint temporal item sets. if lhs and rhs denote the left and right temporal item sets respectively, then the time stamp of each temporal item in lhs is ahead of those of all temporal items in rhs. a temporal association rule is written as lhs >  rhs, where Δ is the interval of different two time stamps.

parameter extraction
this section shows the phase for obtaining three different parameters which are necessary when mining temporal association rules:  a cutoff value for binning transcriptional expression values,  a support value for mining temporal frequent item sets, and  a confidence value for extracting temporal association rules. since the performance of the proposed method is dependent on the parameter set, the parameter set should be chosen very carefully. if the ground truths of cell cycle regulation are known, the regulation information can be used to fit the parameters. however, absence of such kinds of information, alternative information source is used. in this study, we utilize kegg cell cycle regulation path as known information set to find the best parameter set which can extract the most number of accurate temporal association rules. the kegg cell cycle regulation path is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing the regulation knowledge on the molecular interaction, and the pathway contains interaction information which are relevant to cell cycle of yeast  <cit> .

the kegg regulation information is used for a measure of correctness of the extracted candidate rules with various combinations of parameters. if an extracted temporal association rule is matched with kegg regulation information, then we regard the rule as a correctly extracted rule. namely, the validation score is calculated by the following equation:

  precision= 

to select a fitted parameter set among the various combinations, we select a parameter set which shows the highest validation score.

RESULTS
data sets
to check the performance of the proposed method, we used s. cerevisiae cell cycle alpha factor arrest synchronization microarray data set  <cit> . this time-series microarray data set has  <dig> time points with relatively small regular time intervals  between every sampling time point.

fitted parameters
in the parameter fitting phase, combination sets of parameters are generated within binning cutoff values from  <dig>  to  <dig> , support cutoff values from  <dig> to  <dig> transaction, and confidence cutoff values from  <dig> to 100%. with these parameter sets, tarm method is applied on cell cycle expression data of  <dig> genes, which are nodes of kegg yeast cell cycle regulation pathway. extracted temporal association rules with every parameter set are validated with kegg cell cycle regulation information. the precision scores of parameter sets are summarized in table  <dig>  to determine the best parameter set, extracted rules with several sets of parameters, which show relatively high precision scores are examined . the temporal association rules extracted with three selected parameter sets are listed in figure  <dig>  finally,  set is selected as the fitted parameter set which shows the highest precision score . although the precision score of the fitted parameter set seems not significant, the score is satisfactory in the case of microarray analysis. because it is reported that when inferring linkages of regulatory proteins in kegg pathway only from microarray gene expression data set, the accuracy of inferred results were not high owing to the property of microarray itself  <cit> . furthermore, we compared the results with dynamic bayesian network  and bayesian network  inference methods. we used the 'g1dbn' package implemented in r for dbn, and we used the 'deal' package implemented in r for bn inference. the result of dbn is optimized for the precision score after exploring possible combinations of parameters. the precision and recall scores of bn are obtained after model averaging. the results of proposed method, dbn, and bn are summarized in table  <dig>  when comparing precision scores, the proposed method achieved the best performance. however, the proposed method still shows poor recall score like recall scores from two previous methods.

extracted temporal association rules with fitted parameters
using the selected parameter set, we applied tarm method to  <dig> genes which are pre-identified as cell cycle relevant genes in  <cit>  and extracted numbers of temporal association rules with various sizes of transcriptional time delay. to test the significance of the temporal association rules, tarm is also applied to random shuffled cell cycle expression data of  <dig> genes. figure  <dig> is the comparison result of both the real cell cycle data set and the shuffled cell cycle data set. as the figure shows, the extracted numbers of rules from real cell cycle data set and random data set are comparably different. the results indicate that temporal association rules extracted by our proposed method are more significant than random rules.

from the extracted temporal association rules, rules with significant support  are chosen for further gene ontology  term  <cit>  analysis and represented in a directed graph structure . by this analysis, interesting features are found. first, associated genes, which play same role of biological phase with relatively short transcriptional time delay are identified. for example, htb <dig>  hta <dig>  hhf <dig>  hht <dig>  htb <dig>  hta <dig>  hhf <dig>  and hht <dig> those who share same annotation term  are complexly associated with one another within 0~ <dig> minutes and these associated genes are known as having protein interactions with each other. hta <dig> interacts with hta <dig>  <cit> , htb <dig>  <cit> , htb <dig>  <cit> , hff <dig> <cit> , hht <dig>  <cit> . hta <dig> interacts with hhf <dig>  <cit> , hht <dig> <cit> , hht <dig>  <cit> , hta <dig>  <cit> , hhf <dig>  <cit> . second, some temporal dependencies between genes with specific biological processes are detected. like pol <dig>  ylr183c  and hta <dig>  hta <dig>  htb <dig>  hhf <dig>  have temporal association with Δ =  <dig> minutes. pir <dig>  pir <dig>  and htb <dig>  are temporally associated with Δ =  <dig> minutes.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed the tarm method that can extract temporal association rules in time-series gene expression data, and validated the proposed method with yeast cell cycle gene expression data set. a temporal association rule can describe how the expression of one gene might be associated with the expression of other genes with the related temporal dependency.

in the parameter fitting phase, the best parameter set , which extracted the most number of correct associations in kegg cell cycle pathway among  <dig> combinations of parameters, has been chosen for rule mining. furthermore, when comparing the precision scores between tarm , dynamic bayesian network  and bayesian network , tarm method showed the best performance. with the best parameter set, numbers of temporal association rules are extracted among pre-identified  <dig> cell cycle relevant genes. from the extracted temporal association rules, temporally associated genes, which play same role of biological processes  with short transcriptional time delay, and some temporal dependencies between genes with specific biological processes are detected. the strong points of our method are the detection abilities of  various sizes of transcriptional time delay between associated genes,  activation and inhibition relationship,  sets of co-regulators for the target genes.
