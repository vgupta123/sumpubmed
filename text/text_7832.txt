BACKGROUND
obesity is a world-wide epidemic that increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders, cancer and type  <dig> diabetes   <cit> . obesity results from an energy imbalance whereby energy intake  exceeds energy expenditure . strategies to decrease obesity have been orientated towards a reduction in ei, unfortunately without success  <cit> . consequently, new therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting ee are being investigated. discovery of active human brown adipose tissue  has renewed interest in the possibility that it may regulate metabolism and ee in humans .

skeletal muscle is another tissue that plays an important role in regulating ee and several lines of evidence suggest that skeletal muscle and bat share a common lineage  <cit> . micrornas  are short non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression and tissue development  <cit> . muscle-enriched micrornas including mir- <dig>  −133a and − <dig>  are also expressed in murine brown pre and mature adipocytes, but not in white adipocytes  <cit> . the prd1-bf-1-riz <dig> homologous domain protein containing protein- <dig> , a bat-enriched protein controls the differentiation between bat and skeletal muscle by forming a transcriptional complex with ccaat/enhancer binding protein β  . understanding the mechanisms controling bat differentiation may identify potential therapeutic targets to enhance bat-controlled metabolism and to increase ee.

mirna screenings and bioinformatics analyses have identified potential gene targets and biological functions controlled by certain mirnas in tissues and diseases. sun et al. observed  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas when comparing mouse bat, white adipose tissue  and skeletal muscle  <cit> . the oligonucleotide microchip technology used in this study allowed for the screening of only ~ <dig> mirnas however is not as sensitive as quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction  array technology  <cit> . investigation of a broader number of bat mirna targets using highly sensitive qpcr-array methods will provide a more comprehensive overview of the potential mirnas regulating bat development and function. several mirnas controlling mouse brown adipocyte development and function have been identified in mice, including mir- <dig>  −34a, − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  −193b- <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and mir- <dig> . mir- <dig> is decreased in mouse bat following cold exposure and during brown adipogenesis  <cit> . as a consequence, several of the mir- <dig> target genes, including prdm <dig>  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha , camp response element-binding protein  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta  are upregulated, and enhance brown adipogenesis. mir-34a inhibits beige and brown fat formation by targeting fibroblast growth factor- <dig>  and sirtuin  <dig> , two known activators of wat browning  <cit> . mir- <dig> directly targets the 3’-utr of prdm <dig>  <cit>  and controls the differentiation of satellite cells within skeletal muscle towards an adipogenic or myogenic phenotype  <cit> . while the cluster mir-193– <dig> is up-regulated by prdm <dig>  partially through pparγ  <cit> , they are not required for brown fat development and function  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are bat-specific mirnas, essential for the maintenance and differentiation of brown adipocytes in vivo  <cit> . finally, mir- <dig> increases brown fat mass and as a consequence, suppresses development of beige adipocytes in subcutaneous wat  <cit> . however it is unknown if these mirnas are expressed in human bat.

bat plays a critical role in the regulation of energy balance and temperature in rodents and newborns , however its role in human adult metabolism remains equivocal. while mice still remain the investigative of model of choice to understand the role and regulation bat, studies establishing the similarities and differences in the molecular profile of mouse and human bat are required.

therefore the primary aims of this study were to  identify bat-enriched mirnas by comparing mirna expression mouse bat, skeletal muscle and wat using pcr-based mirna arrays ; predict the bat-enriched mirna target genes potentially involved in growth, proliferation and development;  compare the mirna profiles of mouse and human bat.

RESULTS
mouse bat, wat and skeletal muscle tissues
mirna array analysis on mouse tissues
to define mirnas enriched in mouse bat, comparisons were made between bat, skeletal muscle  and wat as described in the flowchart . from the  <dig> mirnas profiled  <dig> mirnas were expressed at least in one tissue. the venn diagram represents the tissue distribution of these  <dig> mirnas. six mirnas were exclusively expressed in bat. nineteen mirnas  were expressed only in bat and wat, with four of these significantly higher in bat tissue . three mirnas were expressed only in bat and muscle and at similar levels. there were  <dig> mirnas  commonly expressed in the three tissues, of which  <dig> were significantly higher in bat compared to wat and muscle . when adding all the exclusively and highly expressed mirnas found in bat,  <dig> bat-enriched mirnas were obtained as shown in the heat map below .fig.  <dig> flow chart of the mirna array analysis from mouse tissues

discussion
the recent discovery of active bat in human adults  has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity . therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human bat development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. mirnas are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. studies have investigated mirnas in mouse bat , however their expression levels have not been validated in human bat. the present study measured and compared the expression of mirnas highly enriched in mouse and human bat, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in bat growth and development. several novel observations were made. firstly,  <dig> mirnas were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse bat in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and wat. secondly, of these  <dig> bat-enriched mirnas,  <dig> were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. thirdly,  <dig> mirnas were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse bat. finally,  <dig> of these  <dig> mirnas were also identified in the list of  <dig> mouse bat-enriched mirnas potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.

identifying the molecular mechanisms  controlling bat development has become a priority to develop therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity. while bat shares a common origin with skeletal muscle  <cit> , studies in mouse wat recently discovered a phenomenon called “browning” that involves the formation of brown adipocytes in wat after cold exposure or β-adrenergic stimulation  <cit> . therefore, it was of interest to compare these three mouse tissues in order to identify bat-enriched mirnas. in the present study, qpcr-based mirna screening of ~ <dig> mirnas identified  <dig> mirnas exclusively or highly expressed in mouse bat, in comparison to skeletal muscle and wat. consistent with a similar study  <cit> , we identified that ~22% of the mirnas commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in bat. of the  <dig> mirnas observed to be enriched in mouse bat in the present study, only  <dig> have previously in bat  <cit> .

mirnas regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis  <cit> . therefore it was of interest to select bat-enriched mirnas that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control bat development. thirty-five of the  <dig> mirnas were predicted to target  <dig> genes involved in growth and development pathways. in cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro,  <cit> . of the mirnas upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, mir-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of  <dig> bat-enriched mirnas predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. this supports a potential role of these mirnas during bat development in mice. while mir- <dig> and − <dig> were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of  <dig> bat-enriched mirnas. these discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes in vitro and mature bat.

most studies have used mice as a model to study bat development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess bat, as well as the limited access to human bat from new born babies. as such, no study has looked at the mirna profile of human bat. it was therefore of interest to compare mirna profiles of mouse and human bat to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. these comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. for the first time, a mirna screening revealed the presence of  <dig> mirnas expressed in human bat, including  <dig> commonly expressed in mouse bat. this screening also showed that  <dig> mirnas expressed in human bat were not expressed in mouse bat and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. further investigations of these  <dig> mirnas will be required to identify their potential unique role in human bat development and function. in contrast,  <dig> mirnas in mouse bat were not present in human bat, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human bat needs careful consideration.

of the  <dig> mirnas common to both mouse and human bat,  <dig> were identified in the list of  <dig> mouse bat-enriched mirnas potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.  <dig> genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these  <dig> mirnas. in this present study, mir-20a was the only mirna predicted to target myf <dig> and pparγ , two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype  <cit> . in contrast, mir-20a is also predicted to target bmp <dig> and bmpr <dig>  a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation  <cit> . these findings suggest that mir-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. furthermore, mir-20a was the mirna targeting the second most numbers of genes  involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. to date, mir-20a has not been studied in relation to bat growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.

mir- <dig>  highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting c/ebpβ  <cit> , a transcription factor forming a complex with prdm <dig> during brown adipogenesis  <cit> . in contrast to these observations, mir- <dig> was identified as a highly enriched mirna in human and mouse bat. this observation suggests that human bat may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. however, the presence of mir-20a, − <dig> and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a “classical” brown fat phenotype in human bat. furthermore, mir- <dig> and − <dig> were also part of the top ten mirnas targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse bat, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development  <cit> . however, only mir- <dig> was conserved in human bat. the absence of mir- <dig> expression in human bat might contribute to differences between mouse and human bat development and function. a gene signature developed in human bat identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype  <cit> . this phenotype is supported by the absence of mir- <dig>  a key regulator controlling classical bat-specific expansion and obesity resistance  <cit> . however the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more wat-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical bat-like signature  <cit> .

the mir-193b- <dig> cluster and mir- <dig> are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of  <dig> bat-enriched mirnas common to mice and humans. inhibition of mir-193a/b and/or mir- <dig> in mouse primary brown pre-adipocytes impairs brown adipogenesis in vitro  <cit> . however, mir-193b null mice, that are also deficient in mir- <dig>  have normal bat development, differentiation and function  <cit> . mir-193b null mice have elevated levels of mir- <dig> suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the mir-193b- <dig> cluster. mir- <dig> expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein  <dig>  levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes  <cit> . mir-19a, − <dig>  − <dig> and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes   <cit>  and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.

in the present study bat from newborns was used to establish the human bat mirna profile. how precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of bat depots  <cit> . in newborns and infants bat is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions  <cit> . in human adults the major depots of metabolically active bat have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions  <cit> . the location and quantity of human bat alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult bat is yet to be determined. however, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a  <dig> - <dig> °c increase in subcutaneous cervical bat, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects  <cit> . this suggests that both infant and adult bat may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. several studies have tried to develop a mrna profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human bat  <cit>  and brown adipocytes  <cit>  mimic the “classical” rodent bat on a molecular level. depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human bat possess gene signatures with a mixture of “classical” bat and “beige-like” adipocytes. the present study analysed newborn bat taken from regions where active bat is also found in the human adult. therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human bat mirna profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of “classic” bat and/or “beige-like” adipocytes. investigations are still required to clearly identify the mrna and the mirna species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within bat tissue depots.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified  <dig> mirnas enriched in mouse bat when compared to skeletal muscle and wat, including  <dig> mirnas specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse bat revealed the presence of  <dig> commonly expressed mirnas in bat from both species. these included  <dig> mirnas specifically expressed in mouse bat and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. the identification of bat-enriched mirnas, conserved in both mouse and human bat, such as mir-20a, may be a common factor controlling bat development. several of the newly identified mirnas, common to mouse and human bat, should be evaluated for their direct role in brown adipogenesis.
