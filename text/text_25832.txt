BACKGROUND
brucellosis remains one of the world's most widespread zoonoses  <cit> . the disease in humans, known as 'undulant fever', 'mediterranean fever' or 'malta fever'  <cit> , remains an important public health problem. on genetic grounds the brucella grounp can be regarded as variants of a single species, brucella melitensis, however for practical reasons, six main species are distinguished: b. abortus, b. suis, b. melitensis, b. neotomae, b. ovis and b. canis  <cit> . historically, only b. abortus, b. suis and b. melitensis have been considered as zoonotic pathogens but recent reports have shown that the newly recognised marine mammal species also have zoonotic potential  <cit> . out of these zoonotic brucella species, bulk of human diseases is caused by b. abortus and b. melitensis  <cit> . brucellosis in cattle  poses not only a significant threat as a source of infection to humans but also the risk of economic losses. losses through abortion or calf death is a huge economic constraint for farmers  <cit>  and establishment of the carrier state in a large proportion of animals may lead to a 20% reduction in the milk yield  <cit> . in areas where culling or other means of brucellosis control are not practised, long-term chronic infections are often associated with carpal hygromas and infertility  <cit> . aborted foetuses and discharges contain large numbers of infectious organisms, and chronically infected cattle can shed lower numbers of organisms via milk and reproductive tract discharges, and can also vertically transmit infection to subsequently born calves, thereby maintaining disease transmission  <cit> .

human brucellosis has been found to be prevalent in urban areas of kampala, uganda  <cit> . the sources of the risks from informally-marketed milk and the effective control measures for human brucellosis have been described. constructing boiling centres either in dairy production areas or peri-urban kampala and enforcing traders to sell to these centres would reduce the risk the most  <cit> ; however control of brucellosis in the source cattle would reduce the risks to humans most effectively. it is therefore important to know the prevalence and risk factors in cattle. a number of studies of brucellosis prevalence in cattle have been conducted in uganda  <cit> . it has been suggested that the high plateau lands of western and eastern uganda were zones of hyper-endemicity, for both human and bovine brucellosis, while the central and southern part of the uganda along the shores of lake victoria were zones of moderate endemicity  <cit> . brucellosis is also prevalent among the ugandan wildlife population  <cit> .

b. melitensis is normally associated with goats and sheep but can cause cross-species infection with dairy herds  <cit> . in eastern and western uganda, 13%  of goat herds had goats with positive reaction in both the brucellosis card test and the b. melitensis tube agglutination test  <cit> ; the risk of human and bovine brucellosis due to b. melitensis is not negligible in kampala.

recent studies in uganda have shown that differences in disease prevalence in cattle are associated with different production systems  <cit> . in zero-grazing systems  where there is a low level of herd-to-herd contact, the herd-level prevalence was low  while in pastoral systems  where there are high level of herd-to-herd contact, the prevalence was 100%  <cit> ; this finding is supported across studies of brucellosis in sub-saharan africa  <cit> .

the present study attempts to elucidate the prevalence of brucellosis, as well as risk factors for brucellosis in cattle in urban and peri-urban areas of kampala, providing inputs for evidence-based disease control in uganda.

risk factors for brucellosis at the animal level
no significant risk factor for brucellosis was detected, by univariate analysis, at the animal level. neither the use of a bull for insemination, nor a history of vaccination against brucellosis nor any history of abortion were found to be either significant risk or preventive factors for brucellosis infections at the animal level . furthermore, at the animal level, the mean rank of body condition score was also not found to be significantly different between celisa positive  and negative cows . the mean parity was not significantly different between celisa positive  and negative cows  and the mean age was also not found to be significantly different between celisa positive  and negative cows .

risk factor of brucellosis at the herd level
in the univariate analysis, large herd size was associated with sero-positive status of herds; the number of milking cows in a herd was significant larger in sero-positive herds  than sero-negative herds . three factors-free-grazing farming, a history of vaccination and a history of abortion - had p-values less than  <dig>   <cit>  in prevalence ratios . there was no collinearity between each two of these four factors.

discussion
in the present study, a brucellosis herd prevalence and individual animal prevalence were observed in urban and peri-urban areas of kampala using a probability sampling framework and a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic test: the celisa. a previous study of only  <dig> farms  in central and southern parts of uganda reported a high prevalence of brucellosis at the herd level  and at animal level,  <dig> %  using both the rose bengal test  and serum agglutination test   <cit> . in a study of  <dig> cattle serum samples from urban and peri-urban areas of kampala, 42% were positive for antibodies against brucella spp. using the slow serum tube agglutination test  <cit> . however, both the sat and rbt are less specific than the celisa  <cit>  and the reported high prevalence at herd level might be due to false-positive serum reactions  and or due to bias in farm selection. false-positive serum reactions in brucella spp. screening tests are known to be caused by unrelated enterobacteriaceae  <cit>  and celisa can eliminate such reactions  <cit> . b. abortus vaccination strain  <dig> also gives rise to an antibody response similar to that resulting from natural infection  <cit>  but celisa can eliminate this false-positive reaction only by approximately 50%  <cit> . in our study, 9/ <dig>  of farms held vaccinated cattle and the celisa positive reactions of vaccinated cows in two farms might be due to the false-positive reactions with b. abortus vaccination strain s <dig> 

the present study identified two risk factors for brucellosis at the herd level: large herd size and history of abortion. for the correct causality, the result should be interpreted that brucella sero-positive status of herds was a risk factor of abortion. free-range farming did not remain in the final multivariable model; however being a large herd was associated with a free-range farming. moreover, the moderate change of logit of the factor - large herd, by a removal of a factor - free-grazing from a model suggested a confounding to large herd by free-grazing which can maintain or enhance infection with brucellosis in a herd. free-grazing farming and abortion have been previously identified as risk factors relating to pastoral systems  <cit> . the unique characteristic observed in peri-urban areas of kampala was the presence of commercial large-scale free-grazing farming within a fenced zone, although most farms are small-scale. this commercialized management system, including milk sales and animal health inputs e.g. periodical insecticide spraying, is also observed in the mbarara dairy production area and could be distinguished from zero-grazing systems  and communal-grazing systems  which are dominant in peri-urban kampala. these commercial herds rarely come into contact with any other herds because they are separated by a physical barrier  but the transmission of brucellosis can be maintained within each large herd while grazing.

in the present study, a history of bought-in cattle was not a risk factor for brucellosis, suggesting the endemic status of brucellosis in and around kampala may be maintained indefinitely by low-level within herd transmission. use of bulls was shown not to be a risk factor. it might be also because of the endemic status; however two zero-grazing herds using artificial insemination were found to be infected with brucellosis in this study. purchase of infected animals or contamination of frozen semen with brucella could not be ruled out  <cit> .

no risk factors for brucellosis at the level of an individual animal were identified in the present study. in mbarara, previous studies have shown that keeping exotic breeds  <cit>  was a risk factor but this was not found to be a risk factor in the present study. age of animal has also been shown to be a risk factor in other studies in mbarara, uganda  <cit>  and also in northern ireland  <cit> . while parity and age were not identified as risk factors in the present study, this may be simply because all samples were taken only from milking cows which are usually more than two years old.

the level of urbanisation in this study was not a risk factor for brucellosis in kampala but large herds with free-grazing farming  are located in peri-urban areas, and the ugandan veterinary authorities should consider these areas for practical control programmes in and around kampala, with a special focus on large farms with free-grazing farming.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study found three risk factors for brucellosis in cattle in the urban and peri-urban areas of kampala: being large herd, free-grazing farming and history of abortion. vaccination remains the most appropriate control measure in uganda because brucellosis is endemic and stamping out may be economically too burdensome. vaccination campaigns, especially focusing on large free-grazing herds in the peri-urban areas, could significantly reduce the prevalence of brucellosis in cattle in the areas and reduce the risk of transmission to humans.
