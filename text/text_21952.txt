BACKGROUND
burkholderia mallei, the etiologic agent of glanders, is a gram-negative, capsulated, non-motile, facultative intracelluar bacterium. most known members of the burkholderiaceae are resident in the soil; however, b. mallei is thought to be an obligate mammalian pathogen. horses are highly susceptible to infection and considered the natural reservoir for infection, although mules and donkeys are also susceptible  <cit> . clinically, glanders in solipeds can present as either a chronic  or acute  form. naturally acquired human infection with b. mallei, although not seen in the united states since  <dig>  has occurred rarely and sporadically among laboratory workers and those in direct contact with infected animals  <cit> . however, glanders is endemic among domestic animals in africa, asia, the middle east, and central and south america. the course of infection is dependent on the route of exposure. direct contact with the skin can lead to a systemic infection. inhalation of aerosol or dust containing b. mallei can lead to septicemic, pulmonary, or chronic infections of the muscle, liver and spleen. the disease has a 95% case fatality rate for untreated septicemic infections and a 50% case fatality rate in antibiotic-treated individuals  <cit> .

there is no human or animal vaccine available for glanders, and development of a partial or fully protective adaptive host response to the organism has not been well-defined. previous studies with b. mallei and the host response have shown that a mixed immune response consisting of both th <dig> and th2-associated cytokines with a predominant igg <dig> subclass does not correlate with protection  <cit> . additional studies with passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies specific for b. mallei have correlated with early protection from infection  <cit> . recent studies have also shown the th <dig> cytokine il- <dig> to mediate partial protection to non-viable b. mallei-vaccinated mice  <cit> . thus, full correlates of protection mediated by the adaptive immune system against b. mallei remain to be fully elucidated.

in this series of studies, we sought to address the impact of depletion of the major effector lymphoid cell populations  and key pro-inflammatory/type  <dig> cytokines  on survival in balb/c mice vaccinated with heat killed  bacilli followed by an intraperitoneal  challenge with live organism. in addition, studies investigating the effect of complement on opsonization of organism and antibody production were assessed. heat killed bacteria were used as a model of vaccination to allow evaluation of b. mallei specific immune responses. the results of this study demonstrate participation of b220+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-γ and tnf-α in protection following hk vaccination.

RESULTS
heat-killed b. mallei vaccination mediates partial protection from lethal challenge
to begin to address this issue in an animal model of acute infection, we established that immunologically naive balb/c mice challenged i.p. with  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu resulted in death by day 4– <dig>  while i.p. immunization with  <dig> ×  <dig> heat killed  bacteria provided partial protection against a subsequent challenge. two independent experiments resulted in similar findings of 40% survival for hk-vaccinated mice with a mean survival time  of  <dig> days versus  <dig> days in naïve mice . the administration of vaccines for b. mallei during an outbreak would mandate relatively rapid onset of protection for human or veterinary use. based on non-routine use and vaccine implementation in the course of an outbreak, a  <dig> day window was chosen for assessment of protection. our results indicate that hk vaccination can afford partial protection to an otherwise lethal challenge of b. mallei by the i.p. route.

effects of cell depletion on hk-vaccinated survival
to dissect the cellular basis for protection mediated by hk vaccination,  <dig> days after immunization with hk bacteria , and at day of challenge, mice were dosed with antibodies to deplete cd4+, cd8+ or b220+ cells. antibody depletion of cd4+, cd8+, or b220+ cells in these mice was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with depletion efficiencies for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and b <dig> populations at  <dig> %, 96%, and 95%, respectively, relative to mice treated with isotype control monoclonal antibodies . our results demonstrated decreased survival rates in b <dig> , cd4+  and cd8+  antibody depleted mice, compared to isotype control antibody, a finding that indicated a possible role for vaccine induced antibody production. when challenged with  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/mouse by the i.p. route, loss of t cells resulted in reduced survival  relative to the non-specific isotype control . in contrast to the loss of t cells, depletion of b220+ cells resulted in 100% mortality relative to the non-specific isotype control . to further evaluate the necessity of these effector cells in providing protection following hk vaccination, relatively resistant c57bl/ <dig> mice, deficient in mature b-cells , cd <dig> t-cells  or cd <dig> t-cells  were subjected to an identical hk vaccination and challenge regimen. mature, b-cell-deficient mice demonstrated a 50% decreased survival  compared to the wild-type mice with an mst of  <dig>  days . cd4-/- and cd8-/- mice exhibited a 60%  and 0% reduced survival, respectively .

effects of cytokine depletion on hk vaccination
similar studies were performed to determine the role of ifn-γ or tnf-α in acute infection in balb/c mice immunized with hk bacteria. six hours before challenge, mice were dosed with antibodies that neutralize ifn-γ or tnf-α. individual depletion of either tnf-α  or ifn-γ  resulted in 100% mortality with an mst of  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively, compared to the hk-vaccinated isotype control mice . in contrast, 40% of hk-vaccinated, isotype control mice survived to at least  <dig> days post-challenge . to further evaluate the host tnf-α response during an established b. mallei chronic infection, we infected  <dig> balb/c mice by the i.p. route with  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu b. mallei. one animal was terminally ill on day  <dig> post-infection. on day  <dig> post-infection, the remaining  <dig> mice were dosed with either anti-tnf-α , or control mab  . no further deaths were observed in the control mab-treated mice. rapid mortality was observed in the anti-tnf-α-treated group, with all mice dying within  <dig> days of treatment  relative to the isotype-treated controls .

j774a. <dig> uptake of serum treated b. mallei
complement mediated uptake assays were performed to evaluate opsonization. results indicated enhanced bacterial uptake in j774a. <dig> phagocytes inoculated with serum treated b. mallei , compared to b. mallei alone, while heat-inactivated serum produced uptake percentages similar to those prior to serum addition . taken together, these results imply an active role for complement components in the uptake of organism by macrophages.

immunoglobulin production in hk vaccinated balb/c mice
we further characterized the ability of hk vaccination to induce a predominant igg isotype by determining igg2a/igg <dig> ratios in i.p. and i.n. vaccinated balb/c mice. pre  and post  exposure serum samples were obtained and evaluated for igg isotype concentrations . no appreciable differences in igg pre-exposure levels were seen when comparing i.n. to i.p. vaccination. in addition, cobra venom factor-treated animals showed no significant differences to non-cobra venom factor-treated animals in igg pre-exposure  levels. conversely, isotype switching in the cobra venom factor treated animals was enhanced in post-exposure serum igg2a .

samples were tested in duplicate and optical densities  read at  <dig> nm. values are reported as mean . n =  <dig> for pre-exposure and n =  <dig> for post exposure. cvf; cobra venom factor.

discussion
recent studies have shown a key role in protection from lethal challenge for ifn-γ in non-vaccinated mice from either nk and/or nkt cells following experimental exposure to b. mallei and b. pseudomallei  <cit> . a similar protective role in the innate response to infection has been demonstrated for tnf-α in b. pseudomallei infection  <cit> . the studies presented here are consistent with the essential role of these factors in the relative levels of protection conferred by vaccination with heat-killed b. pseudomallei and would appear to be viable early markers for protection from lethal acute infection  <cit> . currently, there are no fully protective vaccines against b. mallei or b. pseudomallei in a murine model, particularly for the sensitive balb/c versus c57bl <dig> models. previous studies have also demonstrated that both the humoral and cell-mediated arms are essential for protection from b. pseudomallei infection  <cit> . thus, loss or reduction of tnf-α and ifn-γ levels result in significantly reduced survival rates, substantiating previous reports of the role of these factors in protection against b. mallei  <cit> . moreover, we demonstrate a role for sustained tnf-α production in the maintenance of host survival throughout the course of b. mallei infection. mice with an established b. mallei chronic infection rapidly lost the ability to control the growth of the bacillus upon neutralization of tnf-α. this would suggest a potential role for tnf-α in the maintenance of productive granulomas which may limit the spread of bacteria in chronically infected hosts, or, alternatively, in direct or indirect microbicidal or bacteriostatic activities at the sites of infection. additional studies are underway to determine more precisely the role of tnf-α in host protection to b. mallei.

multiple innate and adaptive cell types may contribute to the production of ifn-γ in response to infection with b. mallei following vaccination. our results with individual depletion of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells suggests that both cell types may compensate for the functional loss of the other effector cell type in the production of this key cytokine. the effector role for ifn-γ in mediating protection against b. mallei may include both immunoregulatory and non-regulatory functions. regardless, the requirement of ifn-γ, as demonstrated by administration of neutralizing antibody prior to infection, indicates that stimulation of ifn-γ response is a desirable goal for a b. mallei vaccine.

similarly, b220-positive cells appear to play a role in protection following vaccination with heat-killed b. mallei. interestingly, this protective immunity, occurring in other intracellular pathogens, is not exclusively dependent on b cells  <cit> . passive protection has been demonstrated against acute burkholderia infection by monoclonal antibodies  <cit> . protection against b. pseudomallei infection by anti-lps, capsular polysaccharide and proteins has been short-lived, suggesting that antibody production offers limited protection in the initial stages of infection by an as-yet-undefined mechanism  <cit> . we have shown that following depletion of b220+ cells, survival rates decreased as much as 100% relative to non-depleted controls and individual cd4/cd8-depleted mice via the intraperitoneal route. results from c57bl/ <dig> mice deficient in mature b-cells , cd <dig> t-cells  or cd <dig> t-cells  substantiate the requirement for b-cell involvement by evidence of μmt and cd4-/- decreased survival. the lack of an effective ctl response to vaccination did not appear to alter survival in what would appear to be a cd4/b-cell -driven response. in cd4-deficient mice, we have the additional potential variable that a cd4-dependent antibody response might also be inhibited during the vaccination phase relative to mice treated with antibody immediately prior to and during the early phases of infection. although not statistically significant, we did observe a decrease in survival in μmt  deficient mice as early as day  <dig> post challenge, whereas cd4-deficient mice produced similar results at day  <dig> post challenge, indicating a role for b cells independent of cd <dig> t cell help, perhaps through a t-independent mechanism of antibody production. although cd8-/- c57bl/ <dig> demonstrated no decreased survival in our hk-vaccinated model, a lack of potential endogenous protein production by hk b. mallei may have contributed to limited mhc-i presentation.

complement associated studies revealed increased j774a. <dig> uptake of serum-treated b. mallei. complement-mediated uptake studies of b. pseudomallei by polymorphonuclear leukocytes  suggest that capsule production contributes to resistance of phagocytosis by reducing c3b bacterial deposition  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that a polysaccharide capsule is present in b. mallei,  <cit>  although in the present study enhanced uptake with serum-treated b. mallei was observed. intracellular survival assays of complement mediated uptake of organisms were not performed in the present study, thus, the role of complement opsonization on intracellular survival is not fully resolved. previous reports have demonstrated the ability of b. mallei to survive within macrophage without the aid of serum coating organisms  <cit> . conversely, the idea of antibody mediated opsonization to facilitate macrophage activation and clearance of intracellular organisms may offer support to the role of b cells in an effective immune response. a possible protective mechanism may include hk vaccination induced production of opsonizing antibodies which may aid in complement mediated uptake, thereby limiting the initial bacterial threshold below a lethal level.

immunoglobulin responses to hk vaccination resulted in modest levels of igg <dig> following  <dig> weeks post vaccination, while post-exposure levels were indicative of efficient class switching to a favorable igg2a isotype. importantly, cobra venom factor treatment of animals at time of vaccination did not alter their ability to produce immunoglobulin. in fact, cobra venom factor treated animals resulted in higher igg2a levels when compared to non-treated. complement activation can modulate both the primary and secondary immune responses and has been shown to enhance secondary immune responses to vaccination  <cit> . the current results suggest that cobra venom factor treatment may affect the modulation of the immune response to b. mallei infection through b cell activation and/or memory b cell generation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results provide a basis for future studies of protection via vaccination using either subunit or whole-organism vaccine preparations from lethal infection in the experimental balb/c mouse model. understanding and defining the role of b cells in adaptive b. mallei immunity will likely be fundamental to the design of an efficacious vaccine and important goals of future research.
