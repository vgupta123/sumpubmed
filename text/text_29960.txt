BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  is an obligate pathogen causing paratuberculosis in ruminants and other animal species, and suspected of being responsible for crohn's disease in humans. paratuberculosis causes significant economic losses to farmers and is becoming prevalent among livestock populations world-wide  <cit> . strategies for paratuberculosis prevention and control require an understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. in particular, strain genotyping is a valuable tool for epidemiological tracing of pathogenic micro-organisms.

map isolates are generally identified by acid fast staining, the size of the bacilli, extremely slow growth, dependence on mycobactin, and the presence of several copies of the is <dig> element in its genome. however, the description of some map strains that are not dependent on mycobactin  <cit>  and the presence of is900-like insertion sequences in bacteria other than map  <cit>  mean that more reliable methods of characterization would be valuable. the most commonly used typing method is the analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism using is <dig> specific probes . is900-rflp classified isolates from cattle, sheep and goats into two major groups using bsteii endonuclease  <cit> . these were called sheep  and cattle  types because of their apparent predominance in those host species. an intermediate  group was also detected in two sheep from canada. strains from sheep are difficult to culture  <cit> , making further strain classification difficult. bsteii-c or cattle types have been described in cattle from new zealand, australia, the usa, denmark, the czech republic, slovakia, hungary, germany, france, morocco, the united kingdom, austria, italy, the netherlands, slovenia, spain, sweden, argentina and norway  <cit> . these rflp types have also been found infecting sheep from canada, the usa, the czech republic, france, greece, australia, spain and the united kingdom  <cit> , and goats from new zealand, norway, argentina, germany, denmark, italy, the united kingdom, australia and the usa  <cit> . these strains have also been found in cervids from new zealand, the czech republic, the united kingdom and argentina  <cit> , in lagomorphs from scotland and the czech republic  <cit> , in alpaca and rhinoceros from australia  <cit>  and in czech moufflon and wild boar  <cit> . in contrast, the literature contains little evidence of bsteii-s strains and bsteii-i strains being as distributed in animal species: they have been reported in sheep from canada, new zealand, the faroe islands, south africa, morocco and australia  <cit> , in goats from new zealand and the czech republic  <cit> , cattle from the czech republic  <cit> , and deer from new zealand and the czech republic  <cit> . is <dig> pcr-restriction endonuclease analysis   <cit>  led to the identification of s strains in australian and icelandic sheep and cattle  <cit>  and spanish sheep and goats  <cit> . a recent study based on is <dig> pcr-rea and other two pcr methods reported infection of spanish goats and bullfighting cattle with s  strains  <cit> .

another promising technique for typing this parasitic bacterium is pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of digested genomic dna . it has been useful for typing other important mycobacteria including m. avium and m. tuberculosis  <cit> . pigmented and non-pigmented isolates from a wide variety of hosts and origins were analyzed by snabi-spei pfge in an effort to standardize the technique for paratuberculosis strain typing  <cit> . subsequently, caprine isolates from spain, scotland and norway were analyzed  <cit> . thus,  <dig> multiplex profiles have been described and clustered into  <dig> major types. other genotyping techniques have been investigated in an attempt to improve upon the discriminatory power of rflp and pfge  <cit> . however, some of them do not provide enough additional information and others need to be validated with larger numbers of strains already characterized by rflp and/or pfge and from diverse host and geographic origins to assess their value for further epidemiological studies on paratuberculosis.

there have been few studies reporting molecular characterization of spanish paratuberculosis isolates  <cit> . our aim in this work was to characterize by is <dig> pcr-rea and pfge typing a large set of map isolates obtained at neiker from different species over the last  <dig> years to serve as a basis for a better understanding of the epidemiology of paratuberculosis.

RESULTS
all bovine isolates grew in 2– <dig> months on hey, and some cultured after  <dig> also grew on lj or in 7h <dig> with mycobactin j. ovine isolates grew in 3– <dig> months on lj, 7h <dig>  and/or 7h <dig> , but only from tissue samples. none of the ovine samples used to inoculate hey produced map colonies. goat isolates grew in 2– <dig> months on the same media as sheep isolates, and some of them were also successfully isolated on hey. mycobacterial cells were not successfully propagated from several cases in small ruminants, although the presence of map was identified on the basis of acid fastness, is <dig> and locus  <dig> pcr results, and is <dig> pcr-rea result. indian isolates grew in 2– <dig> months on hey with no added pyruvate. deer isolates grew in  <dig> months on hey and lj, and wild boar isolates grew in 2– <dig> months on hey and 7h <dig> with mycobactin j. the isolation media for cultures typed by pfge are given in table  <dig>  subcultures in liquid medium of c and b strains grew faster than those of s strains .

is <dig> pcr and locus  <dig> pcr
pcr amplification detected both is <dig> and locus  <dig> in all  <dig> isolates used in the study. these findings and the phenotypic characteristics  allowed all bacterial isolates used to be identified as map.

is <dig> pcr-rea
the is <dig> insertion sequence was successfully amplified from all isolates. restriction analysis of amplicons assigned each isolate to one of the  <dig> strain types previously described by this method. all bovine isolates, as well as the deer and wild boar isolates, exhibited band patterns corresponding to c type strains . in contrast,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of spanish sheep and goats, respectively, gave isolates with banding patterns corresponding to the s type strains; all sheep isolates from portugal were also classified in this group. the other spanish sheep  and goats  were infected by c type strains. interestingly, two goat flocks were infected by both types, some goats carrying a c strain and others an s strain. all isolates from indian sheep and goats and from american bison were typed as b strains.

snabi-spei pfge analysis
restriction endonucleases snabi and spei differentiated  <dig> and  <dig> pulsotypes, respectively . thus, a total of  <dig> different multiplex pfge profiles were identified among the  <dig> map isolates analyzed. twenty-two of the patterns identified with snabi  and  <dig> of those obtained with spei  have not been described previously; the two endonucleases together giving  <dig> novel pfge multiplex profiles in our collection of isolates . twenty-three different multiplex profiles were detected in spanish cattle,  <dig> in spanish sheep and  <dig> in spanish goats. profiles 2- <dig> and 1- <dig> included  <dig>  and  <dig> % of cattle isolates, found in  <dig>  and  <dig> % of herds analyzed, respectively. the calculated incidence for each of the other profiles identified in cattle was lower than 1%, except for profile 23- <dig> which included 3% of bovine isolates. in spanish sheep, strain type 39- <dig> was the most frequently found with four isolates detected in 40% of ovine flocks. four pigmented sheep isolates exhibited novel restriction patterns , and accounted for the  <dig> % of sheep isolates. the other types observed in spanish sheep appeared only once or twice. profile 16- <dig> was found in three goats, and profiles 2- <dig>  15- <dig> and 34- <dig> were identified in a single animal each. the two isolates from deer had profile 37- <dig>  and the wild boar isolate was typed as 2- <dig>  all the indian isolates gave the same multiplex profile regardless of their host species. all bison isolates from usa were 2- <dig> 

several herds/flocks carried strains of different profiles: up to  <dig> in  <dig> bovine herds and  <dig> sheep flocks . eleven bovine and one goat herds gave isolates with two different profiles. the other flocks/herds each gave isolates with a single multiplex pattern within the same herd/flock. pfge typing results according to host species breeds are reported in table  <dig> 

in five cases, more than one isolate cultured from the same animal was available. two cows, one goat and one deer yielded two isolates each one but the restriction patterns of isolates from the same animal were identical. in contrast, an isolate cultured in  <dig> from the feces of one holstein bull was of 1- <dig> type, whereas the two isolates cultured in  <dig> from the small intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes of the same animal, were of 2- <dig> and 28– <dig> profiles, respectively.

phylogenetic analysis of pfge profiles and estimation of genetic diversity
phylogenetic analysis of the multiplex profiles obtained produced a dendrogram with two main branches . one includes all profiles found in cattle, deer, wild boar, indian small ruminants and american bison, for a total of  <dig> profiles. previously described profiles 1- <dig>  2- <dig>  2– <dig>  2– <dig> and 15- <dig>  were part of this group. the other main branch includes  <dig> profiles only found in sheep and goats from spain, including the 16- <dig> profile identified previously and both profiles detected in pigmented isolates . the discriminatory power for this pfge strain typing method calculated as simpson's index of diversity, taking into account all isolates and profiles described, was  <dig> . the index value was  <dig>  for spanish cattle, and  <dig>  for spanish goats, but much higher,  <dig> , for spanish sheep.

discussion
differences in the success of map isolation and, more specifically, difficulties in culturing this micro-organism from ovine specimens, have been repeatedly reported in many countries . some authors suggest that different host species preferentially carry different strains, and the differing cultivation requirements of these strains causes the divergent efficacy of isolating the organism  <cit> . in contrast, other researchers did not report any links between host species, strain type and/or culture characteristics  <cit> . our study does not resolve this issue because we did not use the same methods for all cultures, and culture attempts were carried out with the concrete objective of isolating map from paratuberculosis-affected animal specimens received. nevertheless, our results are consistent with other reports on the comparison of different media for map culture  <cit> , and confirm the existence of different culture requirements according to map type. is <dig> pcr-rea typing with our collection of bovine isolates – presumably the least biased due to its size and to the use of various culture media – confirms the finding of a previous study  <cit> : holstein, limousin and pyrenean cattle in spain are infected with c type strains. these strains are more easily isolated on hey than on other solid media. this strain type was found only in one of  <dig> isolates from spanish sheep, the others, like those from portugal  being s type. this indicates that sheep in spain and probably also in portugal are mostly infected with s strains. some of these were isolated with ease on 7h <dig> without mycobactin j, others on the same medium with added mycobactin or on lj with longer incubation periods, and some grew in 7h <dig> culture flasks . we did not obtain any growth of such strains on hey, but not all samples were used to inoculate hey slants. the single c type strain isolated from sheep dates from  <dig> and was cultured only on lj. consequently, our study does not indicate whether c strains can be readily isolated from ovine samples on hey, but other authors report that this is feasible  <cit> . choy et al.  <cit>  reported that it would appear that the is900-rflp type is not correlated with the ability to culture isolates, as uncultivable sheep isolates from intestinal-mucosal homogenates in australia had the same pattern  as those from new zealand grown on hey  <cit> . other factors, including mycobacterial concentration, contamination of inocula, susceptibility to hexadecyl-pyridinium-chloride  and/or different phenotypic stages could also contribute to the difficulty of culturing these strains. only 26% of the spanish goats analyzed were infected with strains belonging to the c type: the other 74% had sheep  type paratuberculosis. the cultural characteristics of caprine isolates depended on the strain type: c strains had bovine-like characteristics and s strains had ovine-like characteristics. this strain type distribution in goats disagrees with the findings of other authors in spain and other countries  <cit>  who report a very low incidence of s strains. the proportion of s type isolates previously calculated  <cit>  for spanish goats  is lower than that detected in our study . these differences may be due to a culture media bias, but epidemiological reasons can not be ruled out. we found several goat flocks infected with both c and s types, although this was not the case for all farms or animal species studied. our findings suggest that goats are highly susceptible to c, s and b map strains.

although we describe numerous multiplex pfge profiles, nearly the 85% of bovine isolates belonged to only two different profiles, 1- <dig> and 2- <dig>  the homogeneity of paratuberculosis isolates, especially bovine isolates, has been described before  <cit> . apparently, particular map strains have developed the ability to infect a wide range of types of cattle, and international trading has favored the worldwide spread of these strains. this may be accentuated by the genetic homogeneity of cattle as a result of genetic improvement programs and international trading. indeed, bovine genotypes highly susceptible to certain strains may have spread across the world, and consequently the contact between other host species and these strains would have increased proportionally. we noted slight but interesting differences between strain types found in different bovine breeds coming from the same geographic area. holstein cattle had the largest number of different profiles , but this is unsurprising because it was the most numerous breed. more remarkable is the absence from holsteins of  <dig> profiles detected in other breeds. limousine cattle carried more 2- <dig> type and less 1- <dig> type than holstein cattle. in contrast, the 1- <dig> strain was much more prevalent in pyrenean cows. cattle destined to bullfighting came from a less represented geographic area. with the exception of one 2- <dig> type, strains isolated from these animals  showed rare profiles, suggesting a separate epidemiological context. this is in agreement with the results of the study by de juan et al.  <cit>  reporting a high proportion of type i/iii isolates in two bullfighting cattle farms. type 2– <dig> detected in  <dig> bullfighting and  <dig> holstein animal, has only previously been reported in one goat from norway  <cit> . the novel profile 2– <dig> was only isolated from two bullfighting animals. the differences of geographic origin of isolates may contribute to the differences found between cattle breeds, especially in bullfighting cattle.

the seven farms affected with 23- <dig> strains, are all in the same geographic area, some being only  <dig> km apart, and  <dig> of them also share the same veterinarian. these strains were isolated over several years  indicating persistence in this ecosystem. according to the phylogenetic analysis, this is one of the strains more different from the others in the bovine type sub-cluster. we are investigating probable links in food and water resources or historic introduction.

ours is not the first description of mixed infection evidenced by isolation of different strains from the same animal  <cit> , and could be similar to mycobacterium avium polyclonal infections in human patients  <cit> . the bull with  <dig> different strains belonged to a holstein herd with clinical paratuberculosis cases. the other two isolates obtained from the herd were typed as 1- <dig> and 2- <dig>  this is consistent with types found in the bull, except for the extra profile  which was not isolated in any other animal. re-infection of the animal by different strain types is the most probable explanation, because they were isolated from different biological samples and on different sampling dates.

strain diversity in the sheep population was high. all the pfge patterns of spanish sheep isolates were different from those found in cattle, except for one 2- <dig> strain from a rasa-aragonesa sheep from aragon. pigmented isolates exhibited novel restriction patterns designated 26- <dig> and 25- <dig>  the first was found in latxa flocks in basque country and navarra. these were not related to the rasa-aragonesa sheep from aragon infected with the other pigmented profile. this is the first report of pigmented strains in spain. pigmented strains were less prevalent than the 39- <dig> strain, found in basque country and navarra. three flocks in neighboring locations in the main area of prevalence in sheep in basque country, gave  <dig> isolates per flock. for each of the  <dig> flocks all  <dig> isolates differed from each other, but 39- <dig> type was found in all of them.

the diversity index calculated for goats was low. however, including goat isolates reported by de juan et al.  <cit> , the index is  <dig> . all isolates we cultured from goats, except one , have profiles that have previously been reported in this host species. the 16- <dig> type was observed throughout spain and in numerous goat breeds. we detected the 15- <dig> type in goats in cordoba , and it is also detected in other breeds in madrid. in conclusion, goats in spain are affected with a wide range of different strains, including c and s type strains.

deer isolates had a novel profile  closely related to the 15- <dig> type , previously found in the same area. wild boar has carrion-eating behavior, and is a possible reservoir or vector of map, which has been isolated several times from this species  <cit> . however, there is no evidence of diseased animals. the strain we isolated from wild boar was 2- <dig> type, a strain type that is widely disseminated. cultures from india and bison isolates from usa showed different multiplex profiles, indicating they are different strains.

the phylogenetic dendrogram we constructed for our collection of paratuberculosis strains shows two distinct branches. one comprises isolates from cattle sheep, goats, deer, wild boar, and bison, whereas the other includes isolates only found in sheep and goats. this is in general agreement with previous work  <cit> . our first branch  is the same as the previously described type ii cluster, and is900-rflp cattle types. the pigmented isolates from scotland and faroe islands were included in the type i cluster. however, type 16- <dig> found later in spanish goats, was not included in type i, and they were considered to be type iii. our pigmented strain profiles clustered together with 16- <dig> strains and other isolates only found in sheep and goats. it is not clear where these novel profiles should be incorporated, but apparently they are more closely related to the 16- <dig> profile than to those previously described for pigmented isolates. other studies included both sheep and intermediate is900-rflp types within the same cluster, composed of two different sub-clusters  <cit> . this seems to be a more accurate approach because type iii strains are very much closer to type i than to type ii strains. our findings confirm the soundness of the classification proposed by de juan et al.  <cit>  into  <dig> major types . these results suggest, however, that the original classification into cattle  and sheep  strains is more descriptive, has historic priority, and is substantially confirmed by the associations between bacterial type and host species . it is also consistent with the widely accepted practice in bacteriology of using as species name the latin name of the species in which the parasite is found. consequently, we strongly encourage the use of this system with only two groups corresponding to cattle and sheep.

the overall discriminatory power for this pfge typing was not high but acceptable . the problem with this method appears to be the low degree of diversity of the bovine isolates rather than a true lack of power of the typing technique. multiplex pfge seems to be one of the most robust and reliable typing methods, because it explores the entire genome and only depends on the specificity of restriction endonucleases used. other approaches depend on the distribution of repetitive dna fragments, random amplification of certain fragments or on sequencing of variable repetitive regions; all these approaches can suffer from problems of reproducibility or reliability. however, pfge is expensive and time consuming, in addition to the problem of obtaining typeable cultures. this method was unable to distinguish the is1311-b type found in bison  from other is1311-c strains. the discrimination between is1311-b and c is important, because these b strains  share the phenotypic characteristic of preferring egg-based media without added pyruvate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
improved liquid culture media  seem to be appropriate for primary isolation, because they appear to provide the entire isolation requirement spectrum of all strains. nevertheless, we recommend the use of various solid media to avoid biases in primary isolation, and subculture of liquid cultures  onto solid media to obtain pure colonies. alternatively, pcr-based differentiation of strain type before culture inoculation may help to decide the media to be used.

high homogeneity of isolates from cattle, and heterogeneity of those from sheep and goats have been detected. overall typing may need to be improved and this could be done by including an additional endonuclease or complementary techniques. pcr-rea typing is a powerful technique because it can both confirm map identity and provide clear microbiological and epidemiological information. systematic use of the more sophisticated pfge method does not seem to be of much more benefit: it provides genetic information which does not appear to be clearly related to phenotypic properties but rather to limited epidemiologic details.
