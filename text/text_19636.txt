BACKGROUND
although the human genome was declared complete nearly a decade ago  <cit>  and many of the proteins linked to these sequences have been identified, the challenge remains to characterize the functional significance of these proteins. it is particularly difficult to elucidate the metabolic activity of enzymes with no known substrate or critical function. cytochrome p450s  are heme-containing metabolic enzymes that typically catalyze the oxidation of endogenous and xenobiotic chemical substrates. although these enzymes demonstrate a critical role in the metabolism of ~75% of all xenobiotic substrates, less than half of these enzymes have critical physiological functions  <cit> . a recent analysis of the human genome revealed approximately  <dig> distinct human cyps  <cit> . roughly one-quarter of these cyps are classified as orphans with little or no knowledge of their substrates and physiological significance. one of the most recently identified cyps, cytochrome p4502s <dig> , was identified through a bioinformatics approach  <cit>  and is among these orphan p450s.

cyp2s <dig> is likely to play an important role in regulating endogenous metabolism. cyp2s <dig> expression is sensitive to regulation by endogenous and exogenous chemicals. retinoic acid significantly elevated cyp2s <dig> at the mrna and protein level in a variety of human epithelial cells  <cit> , including human lung cells  <cit> . oxygen deprivation within cultured cells also resulted in significant elevation of cyp2s <dig> mrna within mouse hepatoma hepa- <dig> cells  <cit> ; however, a similar treatment in human monocytes did not alter expression  <cit> . cyp2s <dig> expression was elevated in response to agonists of the arylhydrocarbon receptor, ahr, including dioxin and 3-methylchloranthrene   <cit>  and components of cigarette smoke  <cit> . conversely, anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid agonist treatment of human lung cells at physiologically relevant concentrations significantly depleted cyp2s <dig> mrna through epigenetic modulation of cyp2s <dig>  <cit> . cyp2s <dig> was also elevated in chronic hyperproliferative diseases, including psoriasis  <cit>  as well as multiple epithelial cancers  <cit> . it is likely that both transient and chronic changes in cyp2s <dig> expression alter metabolic activation of potential endogenous substrates and may reveal an important physiological role for cyp2s <dig> 

although it has been shown to effectively metabolize cancer therapeutics of the anthraquinone   <cit>  and benzothiazole family   <cit> , cyp2s <dig> is still considered an orphan with no known endogenous substrates. candidate substrates have been identified and include the bioactive lipids all-trans retinoic acid   <cit>  and metabolites of the arachidonic acid inflammatory cascade  and lipoxygenase  pathways  <cit> . cyp2s1-mediated metabolism of these lipids appears to require atypical metabolism  and whether cyp2s <dig> contributes to the metabolism of these bioactive lipids is controversial  <cit> . however, in vitro cellular assays in human and rodent cells appear to be consistent with metabolism of these endogenous substrates  <cit> . previous work in our laboratory, examined the impact of cyp2s <dig> depletion on human bronchial epithelial  cells  <cit> . depletion of cyp2s <dig> in these cells led to enhanced cell proliferation and migration. cell proliferation was, in part, attributed to modulation of arachidonic acid cascade, resulting in elevated levels of the inflammatory prostaglandin   <cit> . the etiology of the change in migration, however, is still unclear.

elucidating the physiological significance of an orphan cytochrome p450s is a complicated process hampered by difficulties in isolation and purification of cyps as well as identifying possible substrates from a myriad of potential chemicals. historically, a trial-and-error approach has been used to identify possible substrates. however, this approach is time and resource intensive and neglects chemicals outside of the chemical library. recently, the guengerich lab has successfully utilized advances in methodology and mass spectrometry analysis to identify endogenous substrates for a number of cytochrome p450s, including orphans  <cit> . this approach is a significant advance in identification of novel endogenous substrates. however, it does not directly demonstrate the physiological impact of changes in p <dig> expression within human cells. to elucidate the physiological significance of alterations in p <dig> expression on biological pathways, we utilize next generation sequencing as a novel, unbiased approach to identify transcriptional changes in biological pathways within human cells. specifically, we compare the transcriptomic profiles of two human bronchial epithelial  cell lines with differential cyp2s <dig> expression: cyp2s <dig> depleted  vs. control . previous work in our lab demonstrated that cyp2s <dig> depleted cells enhanced cell proliferation and migration  <cit> . we illustrate how pathway analysis of sequence-based differential expression results identified the molecular pathways perturbed in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion, provided insight into unexpected modes of action, and informed follow up experiments. here we report how transcriptomic profiles are consistent with published phenotypes and proposed endogenous metabolism. additionally, our results reveal novel changes in the mtor signaling pathway, which has been linked to cell size  <cit> . we pursued this phenotype experimentally and confirmed a significant increase in cellular diameter and volume in cyp2s <dig> depleted cells, suggesting a previously unknown role for cyp2s1-mediated metabolism in the regulation of cell growth.

RESULTS
rna-sequencing analysis of cyp2s <dig> depleted human bronchial epithelial cells 
to determine whether alterations in the transcriptomic profiles would reveal the functional significance of cyp2s <dig> in human bronchial epithelial  cells, we performed short hairpin rna  silencing using sequences targeting the 3’utr  and exon <dig>  to deplete cyp2s <dig> expression in beas-2b cells. the depletion of cyp2s <dig> mrna and protein was confirmed in comparison to non-targeted shrna control   <cit> . the clones exhibiting the greatest difference in cyp2s <dig> mrna and protein expression  were further analyzed using rna-sequencing. total mrna was isolated from three independent passages of each of cyp2s <dig> depleted  samples and scrambled controls  and prepared into  <dig> sequencing libraries. samples were sequenced on the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform, yielding an average of  <dig> , <dig> 1× <dig> nt short reads per sample. these filtered reads were aligned with gsnap  <cit>  to the human reference genome , binned by annotated gene coordinate, and uniquely aligning reads were summated to generate read count-based gene expression estimates. principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering as implemented in jmp genomics { <dig> } were used to qualitatively assess transcriptome-wide similarities among biological replicates and between genotypes . principle component analysis reveals that the three biological replicates from each genotype tightly cluster with one another and the largest aspect of captured transcriptome variability separates samples based on genotype. this low variability within genotype increases our ability to find quantitative differences in gene expression that are truly attributable to differences in cyp2s <dig> expression .

to identify specific differentially regulated genes between cyp2s <dig> depleted  and scrambled control  in human bronchial epithelial cells, we used the negative binomial test of significance as implemented in the bioconductor package deseq with significance defined as an adjusted p-value ≤ <dig>   <cit>  . cyp2s <dig> depletion resulted in the increased expression of  <dig> genes while significantly reducing expression of  <dig> genes. rna-seq confirmed cyp2s <dig> depletion of approximately 3-fold in these samples. quantitative pcr of cyp2s <dig> was performed . the results demonstrate a high concordance in quantification of relative cyp2s <dig> expression between the two experimental methods . a comprehensive list of differentially expressed genes is included in an additional file .

david analysis reveals biological pathways associated with previously published phenotypes
to identify biological pathways regulated in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion in beas-2b, we performed pathway analysis using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery   <cit> . david analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes, identified using deseq analysis , with the additional criteria that the differences exhibit at least a 2-fold change in expression. this further restriction reduced the number of genes to  <dig> . functional annotations were available for  <dig> of these genes. the annotations were listed in terms of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways as well as gene ontology  terms. differentially expressed genes  were used for kegg pathway analysis and revealed  <dig> statistically significantly enriched kegg terms . the most highly significant kegg terms  include cell cycle, lysosome, apoptosis, and prostate cancer. other kegg terms with a significant number  of genes altered in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion include sphingolipid metabolism, tgfβ and mtor signaling pathways. david enrichment analysis was also performed with go biological process  terms. complete go bp term annotations are included in supplementary information . the top  <dig> go bp terms are shown in figure  <dig>  the top go annotations included terms related to cell adhesion , cell proliferation , and retinoic acid regulation . the identification of genes involved in cell proliferation and adhesion are consistent with enhanced cell viability and migration phenotypes identified previously in these cyp2s <dig> depleted  beas-2b cells  <cit> .

cyp2s <dig> depletion evokes changes in p450s that metabolize bioactive lipids
cyp2s <dig> does not appear to be required for survival, since the cyp2a  bgs-null mouse  is both viable and fertile  <cit> . it is likely that there is redundancy between cyp2s <dig> and other p450s in endogenous metabolic substrates. therefore the effect of cyp2s <dig> depletion on cyp expression was determined. a total of  <dig> cyps were analyzed in this rna-seq experiment. the majority of cyps  were equally divided among cyps that were either not expressed  or were not significantly altered in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion . a total of  <dig> cyps  were significantly altered in response to cyp2s <dig>  depletion. five of the eight exhibit at least a 2-fold increase  or decrease  in expression compared to scrambled  control . two of these enzymes  are still considered orphans  <cit> , although hydroxylation of bioactive lipids has been demonstrated in recent studies  <cit> . interestingly, each enzyme altered in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion are involved in metabolism of bioactive lipids including arachidonic acid .

pathway analysis for the synthesis and metabolism of proposed lipids substrates
cyp2s1-mediated metabolism of endogenous substrates remains controversial. however, there exists published biochemical and cellular evidence to suggest cyp2s <dig> mediated metabolism of the bioactive lipids including all-trans retinoic acid  <cit>  as well as metabolic products of the arachidonic acid metabolism  <cit> . transcriptional responses were evaluated for each pathway to determine whether physiological responses to cyp2s <dig> depletion were consistent with its proposed role in lipid metabolism.

transcriptome analysis of retinol metabolism in cyp2s <dig> depleted cells
all-trans retinoic acid  is transported to the cell as retinol  and converted to retinal via oxidoreductases . retinal is subsequently bioactivated to ra via retinal dehydrogenases   <cit> . once formed, ra is inactivated via p <dig> oxidation to a variety of metabolites. the cyp <dig> family is the most effective at oxidizing ra  <cit> . other cyps’  oxidation and conjugation of retinoic acid to multiple hydroxylated products as well as the glucuronide conjugate via udp glucuronosyltransferase   <cit> , respectively, is believed to inactivate ra. heterologous expression of cyp2s <dig> has yielded contradictory results that either demonstrate  <cit>  or fail to show  <cit>  cyp2s1-mediated metabolism of ra. however, cyp2s <dig> expression within a cellular context in both chinese hamster ovary  cells and human keratinocytes  cells demonstrate that cyp2s <dig> contributes to retinoic acid metabolism in cells  <cit> . to function, ra is shuttled to either cellular retinoic acid binding protein  or fatty acid binding proteins   <cit> , depending on their expression levels within the cell. once bound, ra is delivered by crabp and fabp <dig> to retinoic acid receptor  or peroxisome proliferating receptor , respectively, where it alters transcription of numerous downstream targets.

according to the rna-seq data, cyp2s <dig> depletion clearly resulted in significant alterations in the transcriptome of genes involved in retinoic acid metabolism. response to vitamin a and response to retinoic acid metabolism were identified as key go terms . cyp2s <dig> depletion in beas-2b cells resulted in an overall down regulation of the ra metabolism compared to scrambled control . many of the key enzymes involved in metabolism of retinol were not expressed in either cyp2s <dig> containing  or cyp2s <dig> depleted beas-2b cells, including cyp26a <dig>  rpe <dig>  and ugt2b <dig>  cyp26a <dig> is the most efficient metabolizing cytochrome p <dig> at oxidizing retinoic acid, with affinity in the low nanomolar range  <cit> . cyp26b <dig> is the only cyp <dig> family expressed in beas-2b cells and has demonstrated similar catalytic activity toward ra  <cit> . rna-seq data failed to demonstrate altered cyp26b <dig> expression in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion. interestingly, upon closer inspection  we found that other enzymes involved in converting retinal to ra  were significantly upregulated in cyp2s <dig> depleted cells, suggesting a metabolic flux possibly resulting in elevated ra . additionally, the largest increase in expression was observed in fabp <dig>  suggesting that the retinoic acid flux may be diverted into the ppar signaling rather than metabolic inactivation. however, experimental validation is required to test these hypotheses.

transcriptome analysis of arachidonic acid metabolism in cyp2s <dig> depleted cells
cyp2s <dig> has been shown to metabolize products of the two major metabolic pathways of the arachidonic acid  cascade, lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, in the presence of lipid peroxides  <cit> . fromel et al also demonstrated cyp2s1-mediated epoxidation of a variety of bioactive lipids including arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acid  in sf- <dig> cells expressing cyp2s <dig>  <cit> . cyp2s <dig> depleted human beas-2b  <cit>  and monocyte-derived macrophages  <cit>  show increased levels of the inflammatory prostaglandin, pge <dig>  conversely, over-expressing human cyp2s <dig> in rodent cells reduced synthesis of products of the cyclooxygenase pathway, pge <dig> and pgd <dig>  <cit> . based on published data, as well changes in p <dig> expression , we would have anticipated significant changes in arachidonic acid metabolism in cyp2s <dig> depleted cells  compared to controls . however, arachidonic acid metabolism was not identified in the kegg or go terms. in fact, the arachidonic acid go term did not appear in our most stringent  criteria, but it did show up as # <dig> when the p-value was relaxed  . it is possible that the inability to detect transcriptional changes within this pathway could suggest that either: i) subtle transcriptional changes, undetected as significantly different, in this pathway are sufficient to elicit significant changes in aa metabolism, or ii) pathway analysis relies on a priori knowledge of aa metabolism, which may not be sufficient to clearly discern this pathway. these data suggest that transcriptome analysis may underrepresent potentially important pathways altered in response to changes in cyp2s <dig> expression.

to determine the extent of regulation within the aa pathway, we examined genes within the kegg aa pathway . the main regulatory enzymes in prostaglandin production ), eet production , and hete production  are all significantly upregulated. in contrast, key regulatory enzymes involved in the lipoxygenase pathway  were not significantly altered. closer examination of the cyclooxygenase pathway  reveals modulation consistent with an increase in inflammatory prostaglandin, pge <dig> production. specifically, the enzyme converting aa to pgg <dig> and pgh <dig>  is upregulated  <dig>  fold. the prostaglandin synthase  is also slightly but significantly elevated . in contrast, the pge <dig> degrading enzyme, 15-pgdh, is reduced by 2-fold. transcriptional alterations within the cyclooxygenase pathway are consistent with elevated pge <dig> levels identified previously  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that analysis of subsets from metabolic pathways may be required to identify significant regulation.

rna-sequencing analysis reveals a novel phenotype in cyp2s <dig> depleted cells: differential regulation of cell size
to determine whether rna-sequencing analysis could reveal novel functions or phenotypes associated with an orphan p <dig>  we examined the literature for connections between the top kegg pathways. three of the top regulated pathways are involved in regulation of cell cycle, growth factor signaling, and mtor signaling. a common connection between each of these is the regulation of cell size. in order to grow and divide, cells must double their cellular contents . cyp2s <dig> depleted beas-2b cells exhibit increased cell proliferation  <cit> . cell cycle control was listed as the most significant change in the kegg classification. the growth factor tgfβ, exhibits crosstalk with the mtor pathway  <cit> . mtor pathway is recognized as a central regulator in cell growth  <cit> , and represents a potentially novel cyp2s1-regulated pathway.

to probe which genes within the mtor pathway were altered in response to chronic cyp2s <dig> depletion, rna seq results for each gene in the mtor signaling pathway  were identified . a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> total genes , identified by the mtor pcr array as key regulated genes within the mtor pathway, were identified through rna sequencing as significantly altered  between cyp2s <dig> depleted  and scrambled controls . regulation was similarly divided between the elevated  and reduced expression . a total of  <dig> genes out of the  <dig>  genes exhibit at least a 2-fold change in expression when compared to actb: downregulated ; upregulated .

mtor pcr array  was used to validate transcriptional changes discovered by rna-seq. pcr array results were used to establish concordance between approaches  and shrna target . a total of  <dig> regulated genes within the mtor pathway and five different housekeeping genes  were quantified. in order to compare results between rna-seq and pcr array, we identified actb as one housekeeping gene for which expression was consistent between cyp2s <dig> depleted cell lines  and scrambled controls . thus both rna-seq and quantitative pcr arrays were normalized to actb for comparison. the  <dig> genes exhibiting significant regulation are visualized using a heat map . among the  <dig> genes that were significantly regulated,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  were similarly regulated using the pcr array on cyp2s <dig> depleted ; whereas,  <dig> out of  <dig>  were similarly regulated among cyp2s <dig> depleted . all of the  <dig> downregulated genes were confirmed using pcr array in both  <dig> and  <dig> . interestingly, the upregulated genes did not demonstrate this concordance. only  <dig> and  <dig> genes out of  <dig> were similarly regulated in the  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, only prkaa <dig> demonstrated significant elevated expression between the two shrna targets. overall, our data demonstrate a good concordance between rna seq and validation with qrt pcr arrays.

based on validated differences within the mtor pathway and significant changes in cell cycle and tgfβ signaling, alterations in cell size were assessed. to determine changes in cell diameter and volume, we utilized the millipore scepter. cells were cultured to approximately 80% confluence, trypsinized and counted. the average cell diameter and volume of the cyp2s <dig> depleted cell lines  and scrambled control  were graphed . interestingly cyp2s <dig> depleted cells exhibit a significant ~13% increase in diameter  and ~50% increase in volume . this increase cannot be attributed to subclonal variation, since two additional cyp2s <dig> depleted clones exhibit similar increases in cell size when compared to two distinct scram controls .

only one gene, eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein  <dig>  met the criteria of both statistical significance p <  <dig>  and 2-fold decrease in expression. eif4ebp <dig> interacts with the translation initation factor eif4e inhibiting the assembly of translation complex  <cit>  the ratio of eif4e/4e-bp is important for controlling translation of eif4e-sensitive mrna  <cit> . in this experiment, eif4ebp1’s significant downregulation would be consistent with an increase in cell size in cyp2s <dig> depleted cells, since increased protein synthesis is required for cell growth.

we propose that elevated pge <dig> observed in response to cyp2s1-mediated modulation of the cyclooxygenase pathway  <cit> , may stimulate the mtor pathway to promote cell growth. recently, pge <dig> was shown to promote phosphorylation and activation of akt through the ep <dig> receptor in prostate cancer cells  <cit> . furthermore, mitogen-stimulated activation of pi3k and akt have been linked to the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex i   <cit> . mtorc <dig> kinase activity, in turn, stimulates protein synthesis through the phosphorylation and inactivation of eif4eb-p. further experimentation is required to test whether cyp2s1-mediated changes in the cyclooxygenase pathway  <cit> , stimulating pge <dig> synthesis, is the pathway linking cyp2s1-mediated metabolism to mtor signaling and regulation of cell size in bronchial epithelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented in this article represent a novel trancriptomic approach to identify the mode of action for alterations in orphan p <dig> expression. although, a transcriptomic approach, alone, is not sufficient to identify endogenous substrates, it can provide clues into the biological significance of cyp2s1-mediated metabolism, and/or compensation for these metabolic shifts. moreover, it can shed light on potentially novel important physiological pathways. transcriptome findings of cyp2s <dig> depleted cells are consistent with previously published cellular phenotypes  <cit> . the results also identified differential expression of genes involved in the mtor pathway, a master regulator of cell size, which resulted in the identification of a novel, measurable phenotype  in cyp2s1-depleted cells. additionally, transcriptomic analysis was consistent with proposed endogenous lipid substrates as well as compensatory metabolic shifts in cyps involved in lipid metabolism. although this approach provides an excellent way of examining mode of action, it fails to identify specific chemical substrates and metabolic products. conversely, a metabolomic approach identifies the metabolites but does not establish the physiological impact. ultimately, a multi-omic approach integrating both transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, may provide a powerful predictive approach to elucidate endogenous substrates as well as biological significance of orphan p450’s.
