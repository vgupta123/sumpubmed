BACKGROUND
the human gut microbiota is a highly complex ecosystem composed of a large number of bacteria  from several hundreds of bacterial species  <cit> . recently, the composition of the human gut microbiota has been linked to host health and to the development of diseases such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . therefore, modulation of the gut microbiota may be a useful means of developing personalized healthcare strategies  <cit> .

although variations exist in the composition of the gut microbiota from one person to another, common patterns in the bacterial ecosystem of the gut microbiota have been identified, which are called enterotypes. arumugam et al.  <cit>  examined the fecal microbiota of subjects from several countries and found three robust enterotypes enriched in bacteroides, prevotella, or ruminococcus that were independent of nationality or region of residence. subsequent studies have confirmed the existence of at least two enterotypes in which either prevotella or bacteroides species are predominant  <cit> . host parameters such as age, gender, and body mass index  are reported to be linked to the composition of the gut microbiota , and differences in dietary habits have been shown to affect the bacterial diversity of the human gut microbiota. together, these results partially explain why differences in the composition of the gut microbiota are observed in persons residing in different geographical regions .

in japan, a variety of regionally distinct traditional dietary habits and daily routines have developed  <cit> . although the effects of dietary habits and daily routines on the composition of the fecal microbiota have been studied in small cohorts of japanese individuals  <cit> , these effects have not been studied at the national level. here, we determined the abundances and prevalences of bacterial families in the fecal microbiota of a group of healthy japanese adults residing in various regions of japan by using a 16s metagenomic approach. we then examined whether there were any correlations between the subjects’ dietary habits and daily routines and the bacterial composition of their gut microbiota by using the results of a lifestyle questionnaire completed by the subjects.

methods
subjects, fecal sampling, and dna extraction
healthy adult japanese volunteers residing in the seven regions of japan  were recruited into the study. fecal sampling and dna extraction were conducted by using the methods of jin et al.  <cit> .

lifestyle questionnaire
each subject was asked to complete a questionnaire containing  <dig> questions about physical characteristics, dietary habits, daily routines, level of stress, and physical and mental health. to assess the subjects’ level of stress, we used  <dig> questions from the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale test  <cit> . additional file 1: table s <dig> shows an english translation of the original japanese questionnaire, together with the scoring system used for each question.

illumina sequencing and microbiological analyses
the detailed procedures for the illumina sequencing and microbiological analyses are described in the additional file  <dig>  briefly, the v1–v <dig> hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequence was determined by using an illumina miseq gene and small genome sequencer . by using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology  bioinformatics pipeline  <cit> ,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads  were generated  and assigned to operational taxonomic units . representative sequences for each otu were then aligned by using the muscle multiple sequence alignment algorithm  <cit> , taxonomically classified by using rdp classifier v <dig>   <cit> , and then used to construct an otu table.

analyses of microbial diversity
based on the abundances of the bacterial families identified in the fecal microbiota, a heatmap and biplots were constructed, and a cluster analysis was performed by using r program version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the heatmap was constructed by summing the otu table for each bacterial family. a dendrogram based on the heatmap was then drawn by using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  algorithm based on jensen-shannon divergence. biplots were constructed by plotting pc1–pc <dig> scores obtained through a principal component analysis . clusters were identified by conducting a principal coordinate analysis  with the partitioning around medoids  algorithm by following the methods of arumugam et al.  <cit> . clusters with the highest calinski-harabasz  index  <cit>  were validated by using the methods of koren et al.  <cit>  to calculate prediction strength   <cit>  and silhouette index   <cit> . the following thresholds were used for ps: no strong clustering , strong clustering . the following thresholds were used for si: no substantial structure , weak structure , reasonable structure , and strong structure .

statistical analysis
all statistical analyses were conducted by using r program version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . to compare average microbial abundances and questionnaire scores between two groups, welch’s t test and the mann-whitney u test were used for numerical and ordinal data, respectively. to compare the prevalence between two groups, fisher’s exact test was performed. to compare the prevalence among multiple groups, holm’s correction was applied to the tests described above. correlations among and between bacterial families and questionnaire scores were evaluated by using kendall’s tau-b test.

data deposition
the 16s metagenomic sequences determined in this study  and the representative sequences assigned to the otus  have been deposited in the dna data bank of japan.

RESULTS
subjects
a total of  <dig> healthy adult volunteers  was recruited into the study. the number of volunteers recruited from each region in japan was as follows: hokkaido, n = 38; tohoku, n = 40; kanto, n = 193; chubu, n = 49; kansai, n = 49; chugoku-shikoku, n =  <dig>  and kyushu, n =  <dig>  the raw physical characteristics data for the cohort are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the physical characteristics of the cohort stratified by region, age, and gender are shown in table  <dig>  the gender ratios for each subjects’ area of residence were also shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  although there were no significant differences in age among the regions, there were differences in the gender ratio between some of the regions.table  <dig> subject characteristics stratified by area of residence

in each row, scores with the same letter in their superscripts or without superscripts were not significantly different  from each other




taxonomic analysis of illumina sequencing data
a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads was generated by the illumina sequencing . these high-quality reads were assigned to  <dig> otus that were taxonomically classified into  <dig> phyla,  <dig> classes,  <dig> orders,  <dig> families,  <dig> genera,  <dig> species, and a group of unclassified otus . good’s coverage estimate, which is an index of sampling completeness, was greater than 95% for all subjects , indicating that almost all of the microbial content of the fecal samples was covered .

microbial diversity
the most predominant bacterial families in the fecal samples were bacteroidaceae , lachnospiraceae , ruminococcaceae , and prevotellaceae  . the heatmap constructed did not reveal any distinct clusters based on area of residence or gender .fig.  <dig> heatmap of the abundances of the  <dig> bacterial families identified in the fecal microbiota. the data for each subject were aligned to a dendrogram constructed by using the upgma algorithm based on the jensen-shannon divergence. the color scale at the bottom of the heatmap shows the abundance of each bacterial family  and the horizontal scale bar showed jensen-shannon divergence . subjects’ area of residence and gender are indicated by using color codes on the bottom of this figure




in the biplots constructed, the location of the plots in the pc1–pc <dig> dimension was affected mainly by the abundances of the bacterial families bacteroidaceae, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and prevotellaceae  . samples enriched with prevotellaceae were located in the pc1-positive/pc2-positive direction. samples enriched with bacteroidaceae were located in the pc1-negative/pc2-positive direction. samples enriched with lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were located in the pc2-negative direction. the effect of the fifth most abundant bacterial family, bifidobacteriaceae, on plot location was much smaller than those of the major pca determinants. no distinct clusters were observed when the biplot was colored for area of residence or gender ; however, lachnospiraceae was found to be significantly more abundant , but not more prevalent, in the subjects residing in hokkaido compared with those residing in kyushu . significant differences  between areas of residence were also observed in the abundance or prevalence of six other bacterial families , but these differences were only observed between two of the seven areas of residence for each family. no significant differences in alpha diversity score were observed among the areas of residence .fig.  <dig> biplots constructed based on the bacterial family composition of each subjects’ fecal microbiota. a principal component analysis of the bacterial family composition of each subjects’ fecal microbiota was performed, and a biplot in the pc1–pc <dig> dimension were constructed. the relative contributions of pc <dig> and pc <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. a the constructed biplot with an overlay showing the effects of the five most abundant bacterial families on plot location in the pc1–pc <dig> dimension . b the biplot shown in  with the sample plots colored based on area of residence. c the biplot shown in  with the sample plots colored based on gender

discussion
microbial diversity in the fecal microbiota
in the biplot analysis based on the bacterial family composition of the fecal microbiota, the location of the plots in the pc1–pc <dig> dimension was affected mainly by the abundances of prevotellaceae, bacteroidaceae, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae, which are the same families that were found to be driving the enterotypes identified in a previous study  <cit>  . furthermore, no distinct clusters were found in the data from the whole subjects , which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . this suggests that the more sample data is used, the less distinct the enterotype partitioning becomes.

association between area of residence and the bacterial composition of the fecal microbiota
no distinct clusters were found for area of residence in the heatmap of bacterial family composition  or in the biplots of the pc1–pc <dig> dimension . furthermore, differences were found for the abundances of only six bacterial families between only two of the seven regions , suggesting that area of residence does not strongly affect the composition of the fecal microbiota in the healthy adults living in japan. therefore, the dietary habits and daily routines that are common in the various regions of japan today  are not sufficiently distinct as to lead to clear microbial diversity in the gut, which is in contrast to the current situation in thailand  <cit>  and mongolia  <cit> .

cluster analysis based on bacterial family composition and gender
although no significant differences in the composition of the fecal microbiota were found between the female and male subjects in the heatmap and biplots , statistically reliable clusters were observed in the male subjects but not in the female subjects . furthermore, significant differences were found between female and male subjects in the abundance or prevalence of the  <dig> identified microbial families . given that the distributions of the plots constructed by the pca and pcoa were comparable, the position of the plots in the pcoa should reflect the abundances of the major pca determinants . in male subjects, the abundance and prevalence of prevotellaceae, which was the sole strong determinant of a sample plot being located in the pc1-positive/pc2-positive direction in the pca analysis, were both significantly higher  than in female subjects , which may account for the distinct partitioning between cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> in the male subjects. recent studies have demonstrated that the composition of the gut microbiota is gender-specific  and that there is a gender-specific, bidirectional relationship between the host and the gut microbiota that is mediated via sex hormones  <cit> . this suggests that the differences in the composition of the fecal microbiota observed between the female and male subjects in the present study are a result of a gender-specific relationship between the host and their gut microbiota. since there were significant differences in some of the question scores between the female and male subjects , it is also possible that differences in lifestyle between the female and male subjects contributed to the differences observed in the bacterial composition of the fecal microbiota.

meaning of the clusters observed in the male subjects
although the scores for one question about food intake frequency and for four questions about physical and mental health were significantly different between the two clusters in the male subjects , these scores were not correlated with the abundance of any bacterial family. this suggests that food intake frequency does not strongly affect the composition of the fecal microbiota and that the composition of the fecal microbiota does not strongly affect the host’s physical and mental health. indeed, the differences observed in the scores for the questions related to physical and mental health may simply be a result of environmental or genetic factors.

effects of dietary habits on the bacterial composition of the fecal microbiota
among the questions examining dietary habits, the frequencies of dairy product and natto intake were significantly correlated  with the abundances of one lactobacillaceae species and of one bacillaceae species . given that some species of lactobacillus, which is the main genus in family lactobacillaceae, are used in the manufacture of dairy products  <cit> , and that natto is a product made by fermenting soybeans with b. subtilis  <cit> , it is not surprising that the frequencies of intake of these products were positively correlated with the abundances of these bacterial families. indeed, the otus assigned to these two species were classified into the l. casei subgroup to which some probiotic strains belong  <cit>  and the b. subtilis subgroup. in the present study, the frequency of intake of only two kinds of foodstuffs were correlated with the abundance of a bacterial family, implying that the human gut microbiota is affected more by the amount of particular foods consumed rather than by the frequency of intake.

relationship between bmi and bacterial family abundance or bowel movement frequency
the abundances of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae were negatively correlated with bowel movement frequency . furthermore, the abundances of these bacterial families were significantly higher in lean subjects  than in obese subjects  , which is consistent with previous results  <cit> . furthermore, the abundances of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae were correlated with each other and formed part of a positively correlated network together with  <dig> other bacterial families. three negatively correlated families  were significantly correlated with four of the components of this network  , indicating that bmi and bowel movement frequency could be controlled by modulating the abundances of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae. as previous study reported, the abundances of these families associated with lower level of triglyceride and higher level of hdl cholesterol both of which correlate to lower bmi  <cit> . the abundances of christensenellaceae and rikenellaceae were highly associated with lower triglyceride, while the abundance mogibacteriaceae of was highly associated with the higher level of hdl, implying their underlining mechanisms to reduce bmi were different. in addition, a cultured member of christensenellaceae reduced weight and adiposity gains with amending obese associated microflora when inoculated to germ-free mice  <cit> . this result suggested that christensenellaceae was one of the functional key factors contributing to lean body type in the correlation network. however, since there is little published work and this study was based on the 16s rrna gene profiles, therefore, the further investigation should be needed to explain the functional role of these bacterial families to modify the host’s bowel movement frequency. although these three families did not have a direct correlation in a study by goodrich et al.  <cit> , they were positively correlated with each other, as in our study, in the yatsunenko dataset described in the same report, which suggests that these correlations are cohort-dependent.

a positive correlation between bmi and bowel movement frequency has been previously reported in a large cohort of european subjects, and it was also reported that obese subjects had a significantly higher bowel movement frequency compared with lean subjects  <cit> . however, in the present study, no significant differences in bowel movement frequency were found between lean and obese subjects  , suggesting that the correlation between bowel movement frequency and the abundance of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae observed in the present study was not solely a result of bmi. the abundance of otus belonging to the families christensenellaceae  and mogibacteriaceae  were also correlated with bowel movement frequency. however, given that the abundances of these otus were relatively low compared with those of the other otus in the same bacterial family, the correlation between the abundance of these bacterial families and bowel movement frequency was likely not a result of the abundance of these specific otus but of the combined abundance of all of the otus in the families. a similar relationship with bowel movement frequency was found for rikenellaceae: however, no otus belonging to this family were correlated with bowel movement frequency.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we used a 16s metagenomics method to characterize the fecal microbiota of  <dig> healthy japanese adults living in various regions of japan. based on the bacterial family composition of the fecal microbiota, subjects’ region of residence and gender were not strongly correlated with the general composition of the fecal microbiota. clustering analysis showed that the enterotype partitioning was ambiguous in the whole cohort. however, two enterotype-like clusters were observed in the male, but not the female, subjects, suggesting that the composition of the fecal microbiota has a gender-specific component. the bacterial compositions of the microbiota were then compared with scores obtained from a lifestyle questionnaire completed by each subject. significant correlations were found between bowel movement frequency and the abundances of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae. furthermore, the abundance of these bacterial families was significantly higher in lean subjects than in obese subjects. the abundances of these families were positively correlated with each other and comprised a correlative network with  <dig> other bacterial families. together, our results present an overview of the microbial composition of the fecal microbiota of healthy japanese adults residing in japan and implied that the abundances of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae contributed subject’s high bowel movement frequency and lean phenotype together with those of some other bacterial components comprising correlative network with them.
