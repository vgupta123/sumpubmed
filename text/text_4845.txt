BACKGROUND
crossovers between chromosomes occur during meiotic cell division resulting in heritable genetic recombination. these crossovers have a complex, non-random distribution, and in the last decade recombination hot spots 1– <dig>  kilo bases  wide have been experimentally well characterized in yeast, mice and humans . hot spots show a wide range of crossover frequencies, which are occasionally several hundred times greater than the level expected if crossovers were distributed randomly across chromosomes. experimental studies that have located multiple hot spots in contiguous regions of the human genome have found that they often occur in clusters, which are separated by regions of about 50– <dig> kb showing very low recombination frequencies  <cit> .

hot spots do not share a consensus sequence, and the mechanisms responsible for regulating their distribution and activity levels are not well understood, but several molecular features of hot spot recombination have been described . these include a locally open chromatin structure, presumably allowing access to recombination machinery  <cit> , and a requirement for a chromosomal double-strand break  to initiate recombination  <cit> . a less well explained feature of hot spots is the influence on activity levels of sequence context, including flanking sequences several kb away  <cit> . this suggests that epigenetic, or distal sequence, factors may have a greater influence than local sequences on hot spot regulation, and consistent with this idea are recent studies showing that the locations of hot spots in humans and chimpanzees do not correspond despite more than 98% sequence similarity between the two species  <cit> .

local sequences clearly have some influence on hot spot recombination, however, as activity levels can be sensitive to local, single nucleotide changes  <cit> . the molecular basis of this sensitivity is largely unexplained, with the exception of the schizosaccharomyces pombe ade  <dig> hot spot, in which a single nucleotide change promotes transcription factor-binding, creating the hot spot  <cit> , though its activity is also influenced by flanking sequences  <cit> . other sequences have been found to be associated with hot spots including gc-rich dna  <cit> , tandem repeats  <cit> , transcription factor binding sites  <cit> , poly-a/t tracts  <cit>  and some specific motifs less than  <dig> bp long  <cit> . direct experimental evidence for a role of such sequence features in hot spot activity is lacking in most cases, the exceptions being transcription factor binding sites  <cit> , and a  <dig> bp poly-a/t tract, deletion of which was found to reduce gene conversion activity at the yeast arg <dig> hot spot by 75%  <cit> .

human recombination rates estimated across windows hundreds of thousands to millions of bp wide have been reported to correlate negatively with poly-a/t tract frequencies  <cit> , but positive correlations with broad scale recombination rates have been shown for other simple sequences, including the class of sequence with purines  on one strand of the dna duplex, and pyrimidines  on the complementary strand, of which poly-a/t is a subset  <cit> . experimental evidence also suggests that poly-purine/poly-pyrimidine  tracts  in general deserve further attention, for example they have been shown to affect recombination  <cit> , replication  <cit> , and gene expression  <cit>  in model systems and these effects have often been linked to the ability of ppts with some gc-content readily to form stable intramolecular secondary structures under physiological conditions  <cit> . these structures can be sensitive to single nucleotide changes  <cit> , but cannot be formed by poly-a/t  <cit> , though poly-a/t duplex dna can form intermolecular three-stranded aggregates with synthetic oligonucleotides  <cit> . recently, a study predicting hot spot locations throughout the human genome based on statistical analysis of haplotype data found several poly-pu/py-rich motifs of 5– <dig> bp to be associated with hot spots  <cit> , providing further support for the possible importance of poly-pu/py-rich sequences in meiotic recombination.

we investigated in detail the relationship between ppts and hot spots in humans and the yeast s. cerevisiae. we show significantly elevated ppt frequencies in hot spots in both species. we also found that the three single nucleotide changes shown to be associated with human hot spot recombination rates all occur in high gc-content poly-pu/py-rich sequences of at least  <dig> bp, and that sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees in regions where there is a hot spot in humans but none in chimpanzees occur in similar poly-pu/py-rich sequence contexts.

RESULTS
hot spots investigated
recent experimental studies in humans  <cit>  and yeast  <cit>  have reported multiple meiotic recombination hot spots and cold regions across contiguous segments of genomic dna, allowing comparison of sequence patterns between the two types of regions. in the yeast s. cerevisiae, recombination intensity has been assayed indirectly throughout the entire genome using microarray analysis of dsb frequency patterns  <cit> . this study identified  <dig> hot and  <dig> cold open reading frames , and, combining adjacent ones, defined  <dig> hot spots, which encompassed all previously known hot spots in the species, and  <dig> cold spots. for the purposes of our investigation, we extended the hot and cold spots to include the intergenic regions  adjacent to the orfs concerned, since yeast hot spots are typically centred on igrs, in which most dsbs occur  <cit> . the hot spots as we defined them had a mean length of  <dig> bp. dsbs have also been mapped to  <dig> much narrower sites on s. cerevisiae chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , but many of these had very low levels of dsbs and may therefore indicate background recombination events rather than hot spots as normally defined, so we analysed them separately.

in humans, multiple hot spots have been mapped by experimental methods in the mhc class ii region on chromosome  <dig>  in which seven hot spots have been identified over  <dig> kb  <cit> , and in a  <dig> kb segment of chromosome  <dig>  in which eight hot spots have been mapped  <cit> . in each region, areas between hot spots showed very low levels of recombination. two other human hot spots have been well characterized experimentally. in the beta-globin gene cluster, a hot spot was mapped to within  <dig> kb, with a  <dig> kb adjacent cold region also identified  <cit> . the location of the beta-globin hot spot was later narrowed to a region of under  <dig> kb  <cit> . finally, in the pseudoautosomal region of the y chromosome, a  <dig>  kb section of the shox gene was assayed for recombination and found to contain a hot spot  <cit> . all of the human hot spots included in our analysis were  <dig>  kb or less in size. we limited our investigation in humans to these  <dig> well-characterized hot spots known at the time of writing. hot spots have also been predicted throughout the human genome using statistical analysis of haplotype data to infer past recombination events  <cit> , but recent evidence indicates that these methods are not always reliable for predicting hot spots in the present generation  <cit> .

hot spots show elevated frequencies of ppts
we used a pattern-matching computer algorithm to detect ppts in the hot spots and cold regions reported in the above-mentioned studies. a  <dig> bp ppt has been shown to form a stable intramolecular quadruplex  <cit> , but in our search of the literature we did not find reports of shorter ppts forming stable secondary structures, so we initially searched for ppts of at least  <dig> bp. in yeast, mean frequencies per kb were  <dig>  in hot spots, and  <dig>  in cold spots, which was a statistically significant difference . because most dsbs occur in igrs  <cit> , we repeated the analysis excluding orfs and found that the difference between hot spots and cold spots increased, with the mean per kb frequencies  <dig>  in hot spot igrs and  <dig>  in cold spot igrs . the mean length of ppts of at least  <dig> bp was  <dig>  bp in hot spots and  <dig>  bp cold spots, also a statistically significant difference . in yeast, there were no significant differences between hot and cold spots for mean ppt gc-content.

transcription factors can bind to ppts as short as  <dig> bp  <cit> , and we wished to know whether very long ppts were associated with hot spots, so we varied the minimum ppt length between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. we found greater mean ppt frequencies in hot spots than cold spots, with the differences statistically significant, for length minima  <dig> through  <dig>  frequencies for the  <dig> remaining regions of the genome not classified as hot or cold spots had similar frequencies to cold spots, showing that the differences were primarily due to elevated frequencies in hot spots rather than lowered frequencies in cold spots .

the  <dig> human hot spots did not show significantly elevated ppt frequencies for length minima 5– <dig> bp. increasing the length minimum increased the ratio of frequencies between hot spots and cold regions, however, with the differences statistically significant for minima of  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp , and  <dig> bp . in humans, no significant differences between hot spots and cold regions were found for mean ppt length, but human hot spot-associated ppts had a higher mean gc-content  than those in cold regions , which was a statistically significant difference . the difference was not due to a high gc-content ratio between hot spots and cold areas . evidence indicates that high gc-content ppts are more likely to form secondary structures  <cit> , so we repeated the searches looking only for ppts with gc-contents above the mean, as calculated across all ppts of at least  <dig> bp found in the study regions . we found that this limitation increased the levels of enrichment of ppts in human hot spots. the associations were statistically significant for size minima  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp . in contrast, the association between ppts and hot spots in yeast was weaker for high gc-content ppts.

because ppts with mismatches to the homopurine/homopyrimidine motif are much more common than pure ppts, we repeated all the searches allowing some mismatches. in humans, mean frequency differences for tracts of at least  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  were statistically significant for ppts with one mismatch per  <dig> bp allowed. no significant differences were found with one mismatch allowed every  <dig> bp. in yeast, allowing mismatches generally reduced the frequency ratios between hot spots and cold spots, but did increase the greatest size minimum for which the difference was statistically significant from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp when one mismatch was allowed per  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp when one mismatch was allowed per  <dig> bp.

in both yeast and humans hot spot intensities vary greatly, so we asked if hot spot intensity was correlated with ppt frequency. we found no significant correlations in humans, but in yeast we did find significant positive correlations between previously reported hot spot intensity  <cit>  and mean ppt frequencies with the length minima  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, and for minima  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> through  <dig> with one mismatch allowed per  <dig> bp. even longer ppts were correlated when one mismatch was allowed per  <dig> bp, with significance for minima  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> through  <dig>  the correlations were weak in all cases, however, with coefficients ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

the lack of a strong correlation between ppt frequency and hot spot intensity suggests that a high density of ppts is not in itself a primary determinant of hot spot activity levels. high ppt density is also not sufficient in itself to cause a hot spot, since hot spot locations in humans and chimpanzees do not correspond despite more than 98% sequence similarity between the two species  <cit> . high ppt frequency could be a factor in hot spots, however, and it is also possible that only certain types of ppt may be involved in recombination. below, we discuss evidence that ppts could stimulate recombination through secondary structure formation and/or protein binding. exact sequence requirements are not fully understood, either for binding of recombination-related proteins, or secondary structure formation by ppts. it is possible, therefore, that the association between ppt frequency and hot spots may be due to a greater likelihood that regions with a high frequency of ppts will contain a functional tract.

ppts are associated with dsb sites mapped with a resolution of about  <dig> bp
baudat and nicolas  mapped meiotic dsbs throughout chromosome  <dig> of the genome of the yeast s. cerevisiae and identified  <dig> orfs and  <dig> igrs subject to at least one dsb  <cit> . overall, these dsb-containing orfs and igrs averaged  <dig> bp in length. we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> dsb-containing igrs had at least one ppt of  <dig> bp or longer , and  <dig> of them had a ppt of at least  <dig> bp . of the  <dig> igrs on the chromosome without a mapped dsb,  <dig> had a ppt of at least  <dig> bp , and  <dig> had one of at least  <dig> bp . frequencies of ppts with length minima 5– <dig> bp were significantly elevated in dsb-containing igrs compared with the remaining igrs on the chromosome. the strongest enrichment was observed with a  <dig> bp minimum length ; mean per kb frequencies  <dig>  in dsb-containing igrs and  <dig>  in igrs without a dsb. when mismatches were allowed, mean frequencies were greater in dsb-containing igrs than non-dsb igrs with the differences statistically significant for size minima  <dig> through  <dig> bp with one mismatch allowed per  <dig> bp, and  <dig> through  <dig> bp with one mismatch allowed per  <dig> bp. we found no significant differences between the  <dig> dsb-containing orfs and other orfs on the chromosome.

most of the  <dig> dsb-containing igrs showed very low levels of dsbs , and  <dig> of them occurred outside hot spots reported in the genome-wide survey by gerton and co-workers  <cit> . it is therefore likely that many of them indicate non-hot spot background recombination events, since these have been found to occur with low frequency between hot spots  <cit> . for ppts of at least  <dig> bp, the mean frequency per kb was  <dig>  in dsb-containing igrs outside hot spots reported by gerton et al.  <cit> . this was significantly greater than the mean per kb frequency of  <dig>  found in igrs without a dsb .

ppts are associated with broad hot spot-containing regions
because ppts have been shown to stimulate formation of recombination intermediates at distances as great as  <dig> bp  <cit> , we wished to know if they were associated with broad hot spot-containing regions. in yeast, we compared frequencies of ppts of at least  <dig> bp between igrs and orfs flanking hot spots, and igrs and orfs within cold spots. comparisons were made up to a maximum distance of  <dig> igrs from hot spots. igrs one orf removed from hot spots and igrs two orfs removed from hot spots showed significantly higher ppt frequencies than cold spot igrs, indicating a regional association between ppt frequency and hot spot-containing areas. the mean ppt frequency of  <dig>  per kb in the ppt-enriched hot spot-flanking igrs was significantly less, however, than the mean per kb frequency of  <dig>  in hot spot igrs. the mean distance encompassed by the hot spot-containing regions in which ppts were enriched was just over  <dig>  kb. we found no significant differences between orfs flanking hot spots and cold orfs.

in humans, we investigated ppt frequencies for all  <dig> hot spots in windows of increasing size centred on hot spot mid points, which we will refer to as hot regions. ppt frequencies in hot regions  <dig> to  <dig> kb wide were compared with remaining cold regions, which were defined as experimentally mapped cold regions lying outside these windows. we found no significant differences for ppts of at least  <dig> bp, except when low gc-content tracts were excluded. ppts of at least  <dig> bp with greater than the mean ppt gc-content had consistently higher frequencies in hot regions than remaining cold regions with the differences statistically significant for window sizes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> through  <dig>  and  <dig> kb. excluding the hot spot sequences themselves from the analysis weakened the associations, but they remained significant for window sizes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> through  <dig> kb. sliding window plots of the densities of high gc-content ppts in the two regions in which multiple human hot spots have been mapped showed that peaks in density often occur within a few kb of hot spots. for ppts of at least  <dig> bp, this was most striking with window sizes of about  <dig> kb . no significant regional associations were found for high gc-content ppts in yeast.

the associations are not primarily due to microsatellite ppts
one cause of the associations we observed might be a mutation bias resulting from recombination, or other properties of hot spot regions, acting to cause expansion of ppts. with regard to this possibility, the degree to which the hot spot-associated ppts consist of short, direct tandem repeats  is relevant, because microsatellites have well-described mutational dynamics  <cit> , but it is unclear how a mutation bias could act on non-repetitive ppts. we therefore asked whether hot spots contained an elevated proportion of microsatellite ppts. using a separate search for ppts of at least  <dig> bp consisting of short tandem repeats with a repeated unit  <dig> bp or less , we found mean per kb frequencies in yeast of  <dig>  in hot spots and  <dig>  in cold spots. poly-a/t made up a large proportion of these, with mean per kb frequencies of  <dig>  in hot spots and  <dig>  in cold spots. after subtracting the number of pp-strs of at least  <dig> bp from the number of ppts of all kinds of at least  <dig> bp for each hot spot and cold spot, we found that the difference in mean per kb frequencies was still significant . in humans, pp-strs of at least  <dig> bp were more frequent in cold regions than hot spots. this was also the case for poly-a/t considered separately. while not ruling out the possibility of a mutation bias, these results suggest that any bias that may be operating to cause an excess of ppts in hot spot regions is probably not primarily due to insertions causing duplications of adjacent sequence, which is how microsatellites expand  <cit> .

sequence polymorphisms suggesting a function in hot spots for high gc-content poly-pu/py-rich sequences
at the time of writing, there are three known cases in humans of single nucleotide changes associated with altered recombination levels in hot spots  <cit> . all three polymorphisms were associated with several-fold reductions in recombination frequency and were located close to the estimated hot spot mid points. we found that each of these polymorphisms occurs within  <dig> bp of the end of a sequence  <dig> bp or longer consisting of 85% or more poly-pu/py and at least 70% g/c .

known features of hot spot recombination are similar across very diverse taxa , so comparison of ppts between humans and chimpanzees in the regions of human hot spots where there is no hot spot in chimpanzees might provide interesting data. to date, there are six cases in which the recombination activity of chimpanzee chromosomal regions orthologous to experimentally characterized human hot spots has been investigated, and in all these cases little or no evidence for hot spot activity was found in chimpanzees  <cit> . because the human hot spot activity-associated polymorphisms all occurred within  <dig> bp of the hot spot mid points  <cit> , we aligned the human and chimpanzee sequences  <dig> bp on either side of the human hot spot mid points. we found that all five of the hot spot central regions for which alignments are possible contain differences within sequences  <dig> bp or longer consisting of more than 80% poly-pu/py and at least 50% g/c . in three out of the six sequences, there were differences within  <dig> bp of their ends, and four out of six contained a difference in the terminal  <dig> bp. the analysis did not include the dna <dig> hot spot, because the publicly available chimpanzee sequence was missing  <dig> of the  <dig> bp region centred on the hot spot mid point, including the mid point itself. the dmb <dig> hot spot was included in the analysis, but the chimpanzee sequence was missing  <dig> bp from the central region. within these limitations,  <dig> out of the total of  <dig> differences within  <dig> bp of the human hot spot mid points occurred within high gc-content, poly-pu/py-rich sequences as defined above. over all the central regions we found  <dig> such sequences,  <dig> of which contained at least one difference between humans and chimpanzees. of the  <dig> sequences of this type located within hot spots but outside the central regions,  <dig> contained differences. the differences were probably not due to recombination or other features of hot spots preferentially causing mutations in this type of sequence, because similarity between the two species in poly-pu/py-rich sequences as defined was  <dig> % in hot spots, which was only slightly lower than the  <dig> % overall sequence similarity for the  <dig> hot spots.

the observation that all three human hot spot recombination frequency-associated polymorphisms known at the time of writing occur in poly-pu/py-rich high gc-content sequences suggests that certain sequences of this type may be involved in determining hot spot activity. this is somewhat supported by the similar sequence contexts found for the human/chimpanzee differences. the particular ppts that we have identified as possibly having functional roles in hot spots  might prove to be useful targets for experimental studies. secondary structure formation and protein binding by the sequences are consistent with the data, and could be investigated further.

although the sequence requirements for poly-pu/py-rich sequences to form secondary structures are not fully understood  <cit> , the structures can tolerate a substantial proportion of interruptions to the homopurine/homopyrimidine motif  <cit> , and can also be sensitive to single nucleotide changes  <cit> . they have been shown to stimulate inter-plasmid recombination  <cit>  and dimerization  <cit> , as well as recombination hot spot activity in e. coli  <cit> . immunocytological evidence shows that ppts do form secondary structures on human chromosomes in vivo  <cit> , but the possibility that this occurs in meiotic recombination hot spots has not to our knowledge been tested.

the additional, non-exclusive, possibility that certain poly-pu/py-rich sequences could contain binding motifs for proteins that act to stimulate recombination is supported by evidence that ppts can bind transcription factors  <cit> , since transcription factor binding is a determining factor in some yeast hot spots  <cit> . binding of the nuclear matrix-associated type iii intermediate filament proteins is also a possibility. intramolecular quadruplex secondary structures, which can be formed by poly-pu/py-rich, gc-rich sequences  <cit> , have been shown preferentially to bind these proteins in vitro  <cit> .

speculation on possible mechanisms by which ppts could influence hot spot recombination
there are several possible mechanisms by which ppts could act as functional components in recombination hot spots. it is conceivable that ppts could mediate recombination by being themselves the sites of dsb formation, possibly as a result of nuclease action on secondary structures. this seems unlikely to be a common mechanism, however, since dsbs are found at many positions over 100– <dig> bp regions in yeast hot spots, and are probably position-specific rather than sequence-specific . ppts may also function in hot spots by altering local chromatin structure. this could result from their previously demonstrated involvement in the formation of dnase i hypersensitive sites, which are nucleosome-free regions of chromatin  <cit> . an open chromatin structure is one important factor in hot spots, presumably allowing access to the recombination machinery  <cit> . binding of transcription factor proteins may help to achieve this in at least some hot spots, since opening up of chromatin structure is one function of transcription factors, and this has been proposed as the most likely reason for the requirement shown by some yeast hot spots for transcription factor binding . the possible role of ppts in hot spots may also be mediated by transcription factors, since ppts in promoter regions can affect transcription, and evidence suggests that this is due to opening of the chromatin structure by the ppt via secondary structure formation and/or binding of transcription factor proteins . not all promoter regions are hot spots, however, so factors other than an open chromatin structure are clearly involved.

the potential of ppts to cause replication pausing  may also be relevant to their possible function in hot spots. a presently unexplained spatial and temporal coupling between dna replication and meiotic recombination has been demonstrated in yeast  <cit> , and it has been suggested that replication pausing could promote dsb formation via localized modification of histones  <cit> . another property of ppts suggesting a mechanism by which they could promote recombination is their ability to stick together, forming multi-stranded aggregates  <cit> . this suggests the possibility that they may help homologous chromosomes to align prior to meiotic recombination, and it has been proposed that this could be mediated by hoogsteen base pairing interactions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results, along with previous evidence for the unique biochemical properties and recombination-stimulating potential of poly-pu/py-rich sequences, suggest that the possible functional involvement of this type of sequence in meiotic recombination hot spots deserves further experimental exploration. relevant tests include deleting ppts from hot spot regions in model organisms and assaying the effects on recombination. another possible approach would be to test the structure-forming and protein-binding capabilities of hot spot-associated ppts in vitro.
