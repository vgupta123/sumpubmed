BACKGROUND
odor recognition in vertebrates is mediated by a large superfamily of olfactory receptor  genes, g-protein coupled receptors  with seven trans-membrane domains  <cit> . whole genome studies discovered hundreds of intact ors in the vertebrate genome, ranging in size from ~ <dig> in fishes to ~ <dig> in mouse  <cit>  and  <cit> .

a recent study of or evolutionary dynamics indicated the existence of nine ancestral genes common to fish and tetrapods, of which only two are found in birds and mammals. specifically one of these, known as class ii, has expanded enormously in mammals  <cit> . several studies have applied computational sequence analysis and phylogeny methods to study the evolution of the or repertoire in vertebrates  <cit> . one of these studies  <cit>  used motifs to analyze human and mouse or repertoires, focusing on classification of the motifs into classes and classification of the ors using these motifs as features.

we adopt a different motif-based approach that extracts deterministic motifs, i.e. peptides, and explores their appearance along or evolution. we apply the motif extraction algorithm mex  <cit> , the efficacy of which has been previously demonstrated in the study of enzymes  <cit> , to  <dig> or sequences of  <dig> vertebrates. a short explanation of mex is also provided in the methods section. the union of all motifs leads to a list of  <dig> mex-derived peptides, to be referred to as common peptides . these motifs can be mapped onto specific locations on the seven trans-membrane domains.

following cp occurrences on ors of different species we can trace the development of these domains with evolution. using the tree of life, we perform an ancestral reconstruction of cps and determine their evolutionary ages.

for each species we perform biclustering of the matrix of cp occurrences on ors. choosing cp groups according to their evolutionary age we get different clustering patterns.

the use of cps for studying or sequences enables us to explore different aspects regarding or evolution than those uncovered by phylogenetic methods. it also enables us to uncover some fine details of or groups that were previously studied using regular-expression motifs, due to the deterministic nature of our motifs .

RESULTS
cp mapping on the tree of life
we used  <dig> or sequences representing the complete intact or repertoires in  <dig> vertebrates . we extracted a list of cps by applying mex to or sequences of each species individually, followed by a unification procedure to remove redundancy .

all cps are tested for their occurrence on all ors, irrespective of which species lead to their extraction. we define species-specific cps as cps observed only in one species.

on average an or is matched by  <dig> cps, covering  <dig> amino acids on its sequence. some cps partially overlap with one another. the total number of cps found in sequences of one species  is highly correlated  with the number of ors per species .

the percentage of species-specific cps is particularly high in fish and frog . the percentage of species-specific cps drops significantly to an average of 2% in other species, with human having the smallest amount of species-specific cps. this finding might be attributed to the difference between aquatic environment, characteristic of fish and the amphibian frog x. tropicalis that remains aquatic also in its adult life , and terrestrial environments characteristic of the other species: presumably cps were lost – together with their ors - in terrestrial species that have developed later.

we evaluate the emergence and loss of cps on a commonly accepted tree of life representation , using the parsimony method .

we identify "novel cps" as those that exist in the current ancestor/species but did not exist in previous ancestors, and "lost cps" as those that do not exist in the current ancestor/species but did exist in the previous ancestor. cps that date back to previous ancestors are referred to as "conserved cps".

the analysis detects one major addition of novel cps in the ancestor of tetrapods, a <dig>  judging by  <cit>  the branch length between a <dig> and a <dig> is about the same as that between a <dig> to a <dig>  47% of the cps at a <dig> are novel with regard to a <dig>  this should be compared with the fact that 75% of cps at a <dig> are novel with regard to a <dig>  we thus may conclude that the main expansion of or cps has taken place at, or before, a <dig> 

reptiles have suffered major losses of cps, a trend that was further increased in chicken. another major loss occurred in pufferfish.

interestingly, while humans lost more than half of their ors relative to other mammals, they lost only 11% of the cps existing in a <dig>  this suggests that some redundancy in mammalian ors has been removed by or pseudogenization in human. this result is surprising considering the fact that the human intact or repertoire contains much less subfamilies relative to other mammals . for example, there are  <dig> and  <dig> subfamilies in mouse and dog respectively, but only  <dig> subfamilies in human. investigating subfamilies of mouse and dog ors that are not matched by human subfamilies, we nonetheless find many of their cps  elsewhere in. other human subfamilies. in other words, according to the cp perspective the similarity between human and mouse or dog is larger than observed by the sequence similarity which is the basis of the subfamily classifications.  <cit>  hypothesize that the reduced sense of smell in human could correlate with the loss of functional genes. the high co-occurrences of cps in functional human, mouse and dog genes hints, however, that the reduction of the human or repertoire may not necessarily cause loss of functionality.

cps that make a difference
the cp method extracts cps that bear statistical significance. it is reasonable to assume that some of them also have biological significance. we first looked for cps that differentiate between water-dwelling species  and purely terrestrial species. we find  <dig> cps that exist in fish  but not in any other land-dwelling species. similarly, we find  <dig> cps which are terrestrial specific . of special interest are cps that reside in the outer region of the membrane . such cps might participate in ligand binding. table  <dig> lists the cps residing only in water-dwelling species. cps that potentially play part in ligand binding are marked. of particular interest is the cp "rlplcg", which resides on the extracellular loop  <dig> and contains a cysteine, possibly crosslinking with another cysteine on the ors.

domains start from the n-terminal , through transmembrane domains 1– <dig> , intracellular loops  and extracellular loops  and end in the c-terminal 

* – appears also in frog

domains are the same as in table  <dig> 

gpcr remote homologies
ors are part of a larger protein superfamily of g-protein coupled receptors . we searched  <dig> chicken, human and mouse non-or gpcrs taken from  <cit>  and  <cit>  and found  <dig> of the or cps to appear in this dataset . the number of cp occurrences  on an or is easily distinguishable from other gpcrs. the number of cp hits on non-or gpcrs exceeds that of a random model, from which one expects to observe at most one or two cp hits. our observation of up to  <dig> cp hits for some non-or gpcrs indicates an ancestral relation between ors and some non-or gpcrs, i.e. remote homology .

figures s <dig> and s <dig> are histograms of the same kind for chicken and mouse respectively.

in figures s3–s <dig> we study the loci of or cps on non-or gpcrs in chicken and mammals respectively. sharp peaks in mammals correspond to known motifs  <cit> . no sharp peaks are observed in chicken.

locations of cps on the or sequence
we investigate the locations of the cps along the  <dig> trans-membrane  domains. the resulting histograms are compared with conservation loci of single amino-acids  <cit> . locations are determined relative to a highly curated multiple alignment of human and mouse ors. the histogram in figure  <dig> displays the relative coverage by cps of each position along the or chain . highly conserved positions of amino-acids, as deduced by  <cit>  from mouse and dog data, are indicated by red coloring of the histogram on  <dig> positions.

cp-space reveals internal clusters
using biclustering, we obtain simultaneous co-occurrences of ors and cps for each species. this provides a powerful visualization and allows the study of evolutionary trends across species. details of the biclustering algorithm and its application are found in the methods section.

we perform the analysis using different sets of cps characterized by their evolutionary ages.

first, we apply the procedure to zebrafish ors, represented either by the conserved cps, i.e. cps shared with tetrapods  or by zebrafish novel cps . there are only nine cps novel to a <dig>  hence they are not used in the clustering analysis. the results are displayed in figure  <dig>  we identify an interesting pattern in this figure. zebrafish novel cps form almost disjoint biclusters, while or clusters based on conserved cps  tend to share cps . conserved cps cover almost all ors . novel cps cover only half of the ors.

we identify ten clusters in zebrafish using ancestral  cps and six using zebrafish-novel cps. each of the latter six clusters matches one of the former clusters. the detailed cluster assignments are displayed in the supplementary material .

novel cps emerge from speciation and duplication events occurring after the split of fish from a <dig>  we find  <dig> ors that do not have any novel cps in zebrafish and fish common ancestor . this can serve as a first estimate of the number of ors that existed in a <dig>  they reside in the or clusters indicated by red circles in figure. 5a.

classification of zebrafish ors into groups has been studied by  <cit>  and  <cit> . both found eight groups with different or membership . biclusters of novel cps  map perfectly to some groups , where some groups are further split to reveal finer details . the  <dig> ors which contain no novel cps have members only from groups δ, θ and κ of  <cit> . for mapping between our clusters, and the groups of  <cit>  and  <cit> , see additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the biclustering algorithm allows us also to differentiate between the different zebrafish clusters. the assumption is that or clusters which relate to recent ancestry might also bear functional similarity. while some of the cps that differentiate between the or clusters are conserved remnants of duplication events, other cps represent segments of these ors that might contribute to a common functionality of the or cluster. a table of the cps of each cluster is provided .

pufferfish has few novel cps. biclusters formed using cps belonging to a <dig> look similar to the ones displayed in figure 5a. the biclustering of pufferfish appears in figure s <dig> .

unlike zebrafish clusters, not all the a <dig> and a <dig> conserved cps form identifiable biclusters. this suggests that they have been subjected to a higher mutation rate than observed in zebrafish, which may relate to the appearance of class ii ors in frog  <cit> . the clusters in figure 6c relate to the groups γ and δ of  <cit> , .

chicken and lizard have too few novel a <dig> and a <dig> cps, to construct biclusters. the novel cps of chicken form one big cluster, while novel cps of lizard form small disjoint clusters. novel cps to a <dig> and a <dig> also show difference between chicken and lizard. while the former reveals a robust big cluster, the latter show no clusters at all. this implies large number of recent duplications in chicken. the biclustering of chicken and lizard appear in figures s17–s <dig> .

biclusters in mammals are displayed in figures s19–s <dig> . biclusters are significant for cps novel to a3–a <dig>  they can be mapped to class i  and class ii  ors, and to families of the human olfactory receptor data explorer . the mapping appears in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

novel cps and mammalian families
discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we use cps extracted by mex  to study evolutionary processes in olfactory receptors. such conserved cps are known to have biological importance  <cit>  and are expected to play structural and functional roles in olfactory receptors. having extracted such cps from ten species, we use evolutionary constraints to further employ the extracted cps in making sense of the complex relationships of ors of different species with one another.

the evolutionary perspective is obtained by applying the parsimony principle to a tree-of-life accommodating the studied species. it allows us to construct an ancestral phyletic pattern of the presence or absence of cps in internal nodes of the tree. using this construction, we show that the number of species-specific cps is relatively high in fish and frog, but remains fixed in terrestrial species. the species-specific cps in the aquatic species might be related to ors detecting water-soluble odorants. we observe a major emergence of cps in the ancestor of tetrapods and major losses of cps in pufferfish and in chicken. a surprising result stemming from this mapping is that although humans lost half of the intact mammalian ors, they lost only 11% of the conserved cps, suggesting a controlled process of loss of redundant ors. in other words, the potential odorant recognition of humans may have suffered only a minor damage by the severe diminution of their or repertoire.

cps that differentiate between water-dwelling species and terrestrial species have potential biological significance and are candidates for further biochemical studies.

we show that some of the or-extracted cps exist in the general gpcr population, demonstrating the ancient origin of ors and several other gpcrs.

the fact that the or history stretches back to fish was made by  <cit>  who claimed that 85%–90% of frog, chicken, mouse and human or repertoires was constructed from duplication of a single fish or of group γ, dr3or <dig> . one or more of these  <dig> fish group γ cps are also observed in 98% of the tetrapod ors. this is larger than the coverage observed for cps in any other fish ors. these  <dig> cps are also almost exclusively located in the five most conserved positions in figure  <dig> . we point out, however, that major changes have occurred in other nodes of evolutionary history. by studying loci of cps we identify two regions that show high cp coverage starting from tetrapods: the n-terminal and the middle of the second extracellular loop. this might imply that these regions are important for the adaptation of ors to airborne odorants.

gene multiplication events are most naturally exhibited by the existence of clusters of ors. using the evolutionary separation into novel and conserved cps, we are able to demonstrate clean or clusters. this is done by applying a biclustering algorithm to matrices associating cps with ors within species: clean clusters emerge when novel cps are being employed. results vary with increasing evolutionary age of the species in question. our biclustering results of the species studied by  <cit>   generally support their phylogenetic models, but provide finer or grouping and a cleaner selection of the responsible ancestor . finally, we are able to use the cp analysis to provide developmental details of or families of the human olfactory receptor data explorer .
