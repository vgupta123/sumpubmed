BACKGROUND
nosocomial infections pose a significant threat to patients worldwide. gram-positive bacterial pathogens are a significant cause of nosocomial infections that are important causes of morbidity and mortality  <cit> . gram-positive bacterial pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumonia and enterococcus faecalis are clinically significant and the antibiotic resistance in these pathogens has become one of the major worldwide health problems. the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium  are the major clinical concerns today  <cit> . the recent appearance vancomycin-intermediate resistant  and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus isolates  in many countries is the latest development in antibiotic resistance  <cit> . mrsa has now exerted its own impact upon the mortality rate. the average mortality rate from a recent meta-analysis of  <dig> studies was ≈36% compared against a mortality rate of ≈24% from septicemia caused by methicillin-susceptible s. aureus  <cit> .

biofilms are communities of surface-associated microorganisms embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix that are notoriously difficult to eradicate and are a source of many recalcitrant infections  <cit> . staphylococci are known to form biofilms on an implanted medical device or damaged tissues and these biofilms are difficult to disrupt  <cit> . biofilm infections are difficult to treat due to their inherent antibiotic resistance  <cit> .

boswellic acids are the major constituents of the gum derived from the plant boswellia serrata roxb. ex colebr. . the gum resin comprises of β-boswellic acids as the main triterpenic acid along with 11-keto-β-boswellic acids and their acetates  <cit> . the gum exudate is known for its anti-inflammatory properties in the ayurvedic system of medicines  <cit> . the alcoholic extract of the gum is used for the treatment of adjuvant arthritis  <cit> . it has synergistic effect with glucosamine, an anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic agent  <cit> . acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid , a component of the gum exudate is a pentacyclic terpenoid and is reported to be active against a large number of inflammatory diseases  <cit>  including cancer, arthritis, chronic colitis, ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, and bronchial asthma  <cit> . in spite of these therapeutic effects of boswellic acids, little is known about their antibacterial activity and the active principle responsible. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid and its effect on biofilms generated by s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis.

RESULTS
minimum inhibitory concentrations  and minimum bactericidal concentrations  of boswellic acids
the in vitro antibacterial activities of boswellic acids were tested on a group of clinically significant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria . akba was the most active of the four boswellic acids against the bacterial pathogens. however the activity of akba was limited to gram-positive bacteria only as its mic was > <dig> μg/ml against escherichia coli atcc  <dig> and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  <dig> . akba exhibited mic ranging from 2- <dig> μg/ml against all the gram-positive clinical isolates tested, whereas 11-keto-β-boswellic acid  and β-boswellic acid  exhibited moderate gram-positive antibacterial activity . acetyl-β-boswellic acid  on the other hand was completely devoid of antibacterial activity upto the tested concentration of  <dig> μg/ml. all the compounds were bacteriostatic in nature and exhibited an mbc > <dig> μg/ml. since akba was found to be the most active boswellic acid compound against gram-positive bacterial pathogens, further in vitro studies were performed on this compound against clinically important s. aureus and s. epidermidis.

mics and mbcs of boswellic acid molecules were determined using clsi guidelines against  <dig> clinical isolates including atcc strains. aminimum inhibitory concentration ; bminimum bactericidal concentration ; ci = clinical isolates; n = number of clinical isolates.

postantibiotic effect 
the pae of akba was determined on s. aureus atcc  <dig> . the pae induced by akba was concentration dependent, with duration  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h at  <dig> × mic while at  <dig> × mic it was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h. ciprofloxacin was used as control drug in the study and it exhibited a pae of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h at  <dig> × mic while at  <dig> × mic it was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h . the paes of akba were significantly higher than the ciprofloxacin against s. aureus .

the paes were monitored by viable count of s. aureus after  <dig> h exposure to concentrations equal to mic and  <dig> × mic of antimicrobials . values in the same column followed by the same superscripts are significantly different from each other . pae, post antibiotic effect.

time-kill kinetic studies
the time-kill kinetic studies of akba were performed on s. aureus atcc  <dig> . it showed bacteriostatic activity at all the tested concentrations. the maximum effect of akba was observed at  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml exhibiting a ≈ <dig> log <dig> reduction in the viability of s. aureus cells when compared with non treated controls  at four and eight times it's mic over a period of  <dig> h study.

biofilm inhibition and reduction
akba effectively inhibited the formation of s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms, with 50% biofilm inhibition concentration  from 16- <dig> μg/ml  which is in the range of  <dig> × mic and  <dig> × mic respectively. akba also effectively eradicated the preformed biofilms. the 50% biofilm reduction concentration  ranged from 32- <dig> μg/ml for both the bacterial isolates .

effect of akba on membrane integrity
in order to investigate the antibacterial action of akba on the bacterial membrane integrity, the cell suspension of s. aureus atcc  <dig> was exposed to a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml akba for  <dig> and  <dig> min followed by staining with propidium iodide . the akba exposure resulted in bacterial cell membrane disruption as evident from the increased uptake of propidium iodide in comparison to the unexposed cells  . in addition, the membrane leakage assay illustrated the cytoplasmic membrane damage of s. aureus. the amount of  <dig> and  <dig> nm absorbing material in s. aureus cell supernatants treated with akba  was  <dig> and 15% at  <dig> min while it was  <dig> and 19% at  <dig> min respectively , which was significantly higher than the untreated control .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the gum exudate or the resin obtained from the bark of boswellia serrata has been widely used by the practitioners of the indian systems of medicine for various medical conditions such as arthritis, asthma, ulcers, and skin diseases; currently it is being extensively used in various formulations for the treatment of inflammation related disorders  <cit> . the major chemical components of gum resin can be divided into three groups: volatile oils or lower terpenoids, higher terpenoids, and carbohydrates. the higher terpenoids comprises of β-boswellic acids as the main triterpenic acid along with 11-keto-β-boswellic acids and their acetates  <cit> .

the in vitro antibacterial activity results of four boswellic acid compounds revealed akba to be the most potent antibacterial compound against gram-positive pathogens, but it showed no significant antibacterial activity  against the gram negative bacteria. akba exerted bacteriostatic antibacterial activity against s. aureus atcc  <dig>  and exhibited a good pae of  <dig>  h at  <dig> × mic concentration. staphylococci cause a large percentage of catheter associated infections, and like many other pathogens, rather than living as free planktonic cells within the host they tend to form a multilayered community of sessile bacterial cells known as a biofilm on medical implants or damaged tissue  <cit> . biofilm infections are difficult to treat due to their inherent antibiotic resistance  <cit> . akba effectively inhibited the staphylococcal biofilm and also reduced the preformed biofilm of these bacterial pathogens . to our knowledge, this is the first report to provide the evidence that akba can prevent as well as reduce the s. aureus and s. epidermidis generated biofilms.

akba is reported to be active against a large number of inflammatory diseases, cancer, arthritis, chronic colitis, ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, and bronchial asthma  <cit> . the anticancer activity of akba is attributed to the inhibitory effect on the lipoxygenases leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells  <cit> . there are numerous reports available on the antibacterial activity of oleo-gum resin extracts and oleo-gum resin essential oils from boswellia spp.   <cit> . weckessera et al.  <cit>  reported the antibacterial activity of boswellia dry extract and keto-ß-boswellic acid. their findings revealed that the extract was highly effective against selected aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as streptococcus, corynebacteria, c. perfringens and p. acnes; whereas kba was not effective against these pathogens, suggesting that the effective components are other boswellic acids or essential oils contained in the extract. in this study, we extensively evaluated the boswellic acids for the antibacterial activity and further for the first time established that akba is the single most potent antibacterial compound present in the gum exudates of boswellia serrata.

we further investigated the effect of akba on the bacterial cell membrane integrity through propidium iodide uptake assay. propidium iodide is fluorescent nucleic acid stain that binds to dna by intercalating between the bases with little or no sequence preference. it is membrane impermeant and generally excluded from viable cells. the increased uptake of propidium iodide in the akba treated cells of s aureus in our study indicated that akba altered the cell membrane structure, resulting in the disruption of the permeability barrier of microbial membrane structures. leakage of cytosolic constituents  from s. aureus cells in the presence  <dig> μg/ml akba over a period of two h was significantly higher than background levels . these observations indicate that the antimicrobial activity of akba results from its ability to disrupt the permeability barrier of microbial membrane structures. the lack of antibacterial activity of akba against gram-negative bacteria may be attributed due to the presence of lipophilic outer membrane. this outer layer of the gram-negative outer membrane is composed primarily of lipopolysaccharide molecules and forms a hydrophilic permeability barrier providing protection against the effects of highly hydrophobic compounds  <cit> . this may be the probable explanation of the resistance of gram-negative bacteria to lipophilic akba. similar observations have been made in other studies also, where lipohilic terpenes such as carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, geraniol, linalyl acetate,  menthol and bakuchiol have reported low sensitivities against gram-negative bacteria  <cit> .

gum resin of boswellia is included in the list of substances generally recognized as safe , thereby permitting its use as food additive by us fda. boswellic acid extract and akba have also been reported to be safe and exert minimal toxicity on human skin cells  <cit> . the recent study indicates that b. serrata is non-mutagenic in ames test, and is non-clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration study  <cit> . oral preparations of boswellic serrata extract containing akba are sold in the market as over the counter  anti-inflammatory formulations and are considered to be quite safe  <cit> . the ancient indian system of medicine  claims these preparations to be safe and effective dietary supplement against joint disorders  <cit> . preliminary pharmacokinetic studies carried out in humans yielded low concentrations of boswellic acids in plasma  <cit> . in the study reported by buechele and simmet  <cit>  akba was found in plasma at a concentration of  <dig>  μm after the daily intake of  <dig> ×  <dig> mg boswellia extract for  <dig> days. in accordance with the observations made in humans, kba and akba were detected at a concentration of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively; in rat plasma following single oral dose administration of  <dig> mg/kg boswellia serrata extract  <cit> . further attempts should be made to improve the bioavailability of akba through lipid based delivery systems. as the literature suggested that the intake of a high fat meal increases three to fivefold in the plasma concentrations of boswellic acid molecules  <cit> .

in addition to the above reported usage and safety associated with akba, the potent antibacterial activity reported in this study warrants that the structure of akba can be further exploited to evolve potential lead compounds in the discovery of new anti-gram-positive and anti-biofilm agents.
