BACKGROUND
androgens mediate their effect through the androgen receptor  and together they play integral roles in the development and maintenance of the prostate. in the absence of a functional androgen-axis during development, the prostate will fail to form <cit> . the size of the prostate increases with the elevation of levels of androgens in males during puberty <cit> . androgens promote proliferation, differentiation, and survival of prostate cells <cit> . men that have used excess androgens in the form of anabolic steroids have a higher incidence of prostate cancer  <cit> . association of prostate cancer with levels of androgens has also been reported in rodents <cit> . reduction of androgen in humans or dogs before puberty by castration is associated with decreased incidence of prostate cancer <cit> . castration of adult males causes apoptosis of prostatic epithelium, involution and reduction of the prostate  <cit> . thus the prostate gland is an androgen-dependent organ where androgens are the predominant mitogenic stimulus <cit> . the dependency of the prostate epithelium on androgens provides the underlying rationale for treating prostate cancer with chemical or surgical castration  <cit> .

the ar is a ligand-activated transcription factor <cit>  that regulates transcription of genes that contain androgen response elements  in the upstream or downstream regulatory regions of the promoter and/or enhancer. kallikrein  <dig>  is an example of a gene that contains numerous functional ares that the ar interacts with to increase transcription in response to androgens  <cit> . klk <dig>  also known as prostate-specific antigen , is the main tumor marker for prostate cancer and has been used clinically for  <dig> years <cit> . serum levels of psa correlate with tumor volume <cit> . however, as a screening and monitoring tool for prostate cancer, serum psa levels are subject to false positives and false negatives <cit> .

identification of the genes that change in expression in response to androgen in prostate cells is essential for the understanding of androgen-dependency of the normal prostate and the proliferation, survival, and hormonal progression of prostate cancer. there are several studies that have investigated genes that alter expression in response to a changing androgen-axis using sage  <cit> . here we highlight several key differences in the current experimental design from previous studies: 1) a physiological concentration of metabolically stable androgen  was employed in vitro; 2) the transcriptome was catalogued using longsage <cit>  opposed to sage <cit>  because it generates lengthier tags allowing increased confidence in tag-to-gene mapping, and leaves fewer tags unmapped <cit> ; 3) the transcriptome of human prostate cancer cells was examined instead of murine cells  <cit> ; 4) sequencing depth was increased by approximately  <dig> - <dig> times more tags relative to other studies  <cit>  to improve the potential for novel findings; 5) transcript expression was validated using an alternative assay as opposed to protein expression  <cit> , and tens of novel genes were validated as opposed to only two <cit> . thus, we apply longsage for the first time to create transcript libraries of prostate cancer cells maintained in the presence or absence of androgen. these libraries are publicly available at gene expression omnibus. we describe  <dig> genes never before identified or validated to alter expression in response to androgen treatment. these genes were: arl6ip <dig>  blvrb, c19orf <dig>  c1orf <dig>  c6orf <dig>  camk2n <dig>  ccni, dera, errfi <dig>  glul, golph <dig>  hm <dig>  hsp90b <dig>  manea, nans, nipsnap3a, slc41a <dig>  sod <dig>  svip, taok <dig>  tcp <dig>  tmem <dig>  usp <dig>  and vta <dig>  statistically significant changes in expression of arl6ip <dig>  camk2n <dig>  errfi <dig>  hsp90b <dig>  and taok <dig> in response to reduced levels of circulating androgens were measured using in vivo samples.

RESULTS
summary of longsage libraries
longsage was employed to obtain quantitative gene expression profiles of human prostate cancer cells treated with or without synthetic androgen r <dig>  lncap human prostate cancer cells were chosen as the model cell line for evaluating androgen signaling because they respond to androgens, express a functional although mutated  ar, they can be grown in vitro as a monolayer or in vivo as a xenograft or in the hollow fiber model  <cit> . lncap cells have been used extensively in prostate cancer research. the time of  <dig> hours for treatment and concentration of r <dig>  were chosen based upon optimal induction of levels of klk <dig> mrna  <cit> .

longsage libraries were sequenced to a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   tags . the libraries were filtered on several levels to leave only useful tags for analysis. first, bad tags were removed if they contained at least one n-base call in the longsage tag sequence. notably, when bad tags were filtered the percentages of duplicate ditags in the r <dig> and vehicle longsage libraries were 6% and 5%, respectively. early sage studies suggest duplicate ditags likely represent polymerase chain reaction  artifacts due to the low probability the same two tags will ligate together to form ditags <cit> . however, with longsage library sequencing and highly expressed transcripts, this probability becomes significant <cit> . a recent study <cit>  suggests that discarding duplicate ditags in longsage analysis may introduce a bias affecting the fold differences in tag expression between libraries for all tags observed at a frequency >/ <dig> . therefore, we opted to retain duplicate ditags. phred software was used to call bases for the sequencing of the longsage tags <cit> . phred has a small, but significant error rate in base-calls. to ascertain which tags potentially contained these erroneous base-calls, we calculated a tag sequence quality factor  and probability <cit> . the second line of filtering removed longsage tags with probabilities less than  <dig>  . linkers of known sequence were introduced into sage libraries as primers for amplifying ditags prior to concatenation <cit> . these linker sequences were designed so they do not map to the human genome. at a low frequency, linkers ligate to themselves creating linker-derived tags . these ldts do not represent transcripts and are removed from the longsage libraries. after filtering, there were  <dig>  total useful tags representing  <dig>  tag sequences in the r <dig> longsage library, and  <dig>  total useful tags representing  <dig>  tag sequences in the vehicle longsage library. due to redundancy in the expressed sequences, the combined number of useful tag types in the r <dig> and vehicle longsage libraries was  <dig> . the remainder of the data analysis in this manuscript was carried out using this filtered data.

tag frequency and transcript abundance
tag frequency spanned over three orders of magnitude corresponding to transcript abundance of  <dig> to  <dig>  copies per cell  <cit> . the distribution of longsage tag frequencies per  <dig>  tags revealed the majority  of tag types in each longsage library  were singletons . this result was consistent with other published sage libraries reporting 66% singletons <cit> . singletons can represent very low abundance transcripts  or pcr/sequencing errors. estimates indicate that less than 17% of longsage tags in a library contain pcr/sequencing errors <cit> . coincidently, 17% of the total tags in the r <dig> and vehicle longsage libraries roughly equal the number of singletons in each longsage library . although initial estimates suggest  <dig> -10% of shortsage tags contain pcr/sequencing errors, more recent experimental evidence suggests the actual error rate is much lower  <cit> . this implies that an error rate of 17% may also be an overestimate for longsage tags. tag types counted 2- <dig> times per  <dig>  tags  and 5- <dig> times per  <dig>  tags  were the second and third most common groups of tag types, respectively. generally, high frequency tags were less common. the majority of total tags in each longsage library were derived from a few tag types detected between 10- <dig> times per  <dig>  tags .

mapping distribution of longsage tags
when mapped tags  were clustered to amalgamate 1-off tags  and tags that mapped ambiguously were removed, the tag types in the r <dig> and vehicle longsage libraries represented  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  genes, respectively . tag types that mapped ambiguously constituted 13% , while 36%  and 35%  of tag types did not map to the genome . due to the fact that these tags were clustered, the majority of the tags that did not map to the genome probably represent true unannotated transcripts rather than pcr/sequencing errors. approximately 28% of tags in each longsage library mapped to the opposite strand of known genes. these longsage tags either represent transcription from previously undescribed coding regions or true antisense transcripts. each longsage library contained tags representing transcripts from 32% of the genes in the ensembl gene database. this percentage is indicative of the depth of coverage of the transcriptome achieved with longsage. alternatively, this percentage indicates that one third of known ensembl genes were expressed in lncap cells under these experimental conditions. this percentage is substantial when considering tag types from the mouse atlas project  mapped to 57% of the ensembl transcript database <cit> . approximately 63%  and 61%  of the genes that mapped to ensembl's database were associated with more than one tag type to suggest that most gene expression was represented by transcript variants which is consistent with previous observations <cit> . when the mapped longsage tags  were clustered to amalgamate 1-off tags and tags that mapped ambiguously were removed, 53% of tags mapped solely to known exons, 9% solely to known introns , and 38% to intergenic regions .

x ensembl gene  was used for mapping

y clustering amalgamated 1-off tags with likely 'parent' tags to improve the mapping capability of longsage tags clustering altered the number of tag types without changing the total number of tags in the libraries

the two most abundant tag types in the longsage libraries were shared by both libraries. the first highly abundant longsage tag mapped to human mitochondrial nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain  <dig>  this gene is also highly expressed in other human tissues . the protein product of this gene transfers electrons from nadh to ubiquinone to generate adenosine triphosphate as metabolic energy. using the ensembl database, the second most abundant longsage tag mapped to a non-coding gene of human mitochondria. in contrast to the higher abundance classes, the lower abundance classes were enriched for longsage tags that mapped to genes with functions in regulating transcription . this is particularly significant because the percentages of longsage tags that mapped to the genome in the lower abundance class were reduced compared to the higher abundance classes . together this implies that the number of tags that map to genes with a function in transcription may be underestimated, as low abundance tags may be underrepresented.

differential gene expression
venn analysis identified that 36% and 38% of tag types were exclusive to the r <dig> or vehicle longsage libraries, respectively . the unique expression of tag types indicates differential expression depending upon androgen stimulation. the biological relevance of this differential expression is complicated by the fact that 85%  and 88%  of these exclusive longsage tags were singletons. consistent with our observation that low abundance tags did not map as readily to the genome, the mutually exclusive tags also did not map as readily as tags shared between both libraries. only 17% and 15% of tags exclusive to r <dig> and vehicle longsage libraries, respectively, mapped unambiguously sense to refseq, in contrast to 39% of shared tags. we therefore, concentrated on genes for which the tag abundance allowed for the determination of statistically significant changes in transcript abundance.

a scatter plot illustrates observed tag counts in longsage libraries relative to the confidence intervals  of respective p-values  by audic and claverie statistics <cit>  .  <dig> tags were differentially expressed  between the two longsage libraries . longsage tags statistically  differentially represented between the libraries were enriched in the higher abundance classes compared to the lower abundance classes . additionally, 90% of the longsage tags were statistically  differentially represented between the libraries with ≥ 2-fold differences, compared to only 17% of tags with p-values greater than  <dig>  .

a statistics according to the audic and claverie test statistic

a stringent p-value cutoff , not corrected for multiple tests, was employed prior to validation of changes in expression of a gene in response to androgen. longsage tags that were differentially expressed, but mapped ambiguously to more than one gene, and/or differed by less than 2-fold between the treatment groups, were excluded from analysis. application of these criteria reduced the longsage tags from  <dig> to  <dig>  these  <dig> tags represented  <dig> genes. analysis of differentially expressed longsage tags revealed that  <dig> longsage tags that mapped to  <dig> genes were previously known to change in expression in the direction observed in response to androgen in prostate cancer cells. of these, the expression of  <dig> genes increased as expected, including the well-known androgen-regulated gene, klk <dig> . the expression of  <dig> genes decreased in response to androgen and were consistent with previous reports . genes previously not reported to alter expression in response to androgen in prostate cancer cells were represented by  <dig> longsage tags. these tags represented the expression of  <dig> genes that were increased, excluding mappings to non-coding and intergenic regions, , and expression of  <dig> genes that was decreased  in response to androgen. the  <dig> tags were represented by  <dig> genes because one tag did not map to the human genome  and two tags mapped to intergenic regions of the human mitochondrial genome . three genes were represented twice in the tables . one gene, krt <dig>  was categorized in both the known and not previously known categories due to the sense of the mapping .

interestingly some antisense tags were identified as differentially expressed in response to androgen. antisense to nkx3- <dig> is of particular note. transcription of this gene is regulated by androgen in a time- and concentration-dependent manner  <cit>  with an are confirmed in its enhancer region  <cit> . anti-sense rna is involved in transcriptional silencing of sense transcript, imprinting control, post-transcriptional down-regulation of sense transcript or even stabilizing/promotion of the expression of the sense transcript  <cit> . in the case of nkx3- <dig>  antisense transcript may be a negative feedback mechanism; however, this remains to be determined.

validation of changes in gene expression in response to androgen
quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction  was used to validate changes in gene expression in response to androgen of  <dig>  of the  <dig> total genes identified by longsage. of the  <dig> genes previously not reported to change expression in response to androgens in prostate cancer cells, only  <dig> were quantified by qrt-pcr, because technical limitations and gaps in the transcriptome databases prevented the analysis of  <dig> genes. that is, specific qrt-pcr primers could not be designed due to repetition in the genome, or because the tag mapped to an unannotated transcript variant. there were  <dig> of the  <dig>  novel genes that displayed statistically significant differential expression in response to androgen as measured by qrt-pcr . blvrb, c19orf <dig>  c1orf <dig>  errfi <dig>  glul, golph <dig>  hm <dig>  hsp90b <dig>  nans, slc41a <dig>  taok <dig>  tcp <dig>  tmem <dig>  and usp <dig> all increased levels of expression in response to androgen, while arl6ip <dig>  c6orf <dig>  camk2n <dig>  ccni, dera, manea, nipsnap3a, sod <dig>  svip, and vta <dig> decreased in response to androgen . under the experimental conditions and primers used, we did not measure statistically significant changes in expression of prnpip and capns <dig>  a false discovery rate  <cit>  of 29% was expected of the longsage data based on the audic and claverie p-value ≤  <dig> . this fdr represents the anticipated percentage of type i errors . we observed only 2/ <dig>  false positives, suggesting that the other filter parameters  may have the increased the chances of validation by qrt-pcr. moreover, the expression trends for all  <dig> genes known to change expression in response to androgen in prostate cancer cells correlated between the longsage and qrt-pcr data. adamts <dig>  cenpn, creb3l <dig>  fkbp <dig>  klk <dig>  lrig <dig>  ncapd <dig>  pak1ip <dig>  and rhou all increased levels of expression in response to androgen while cxcr <dig>  nts, prkacb, and st <dig> decreased in response to androgen .

known or potential ares in the regulatory regions of androgen-regulated genes
ar directly regulates transcription in response to androgen by binding to ares in the promoter and/or enhancer regions of target genes. chip-chip database mining for suggested ares combined with a literature search for known ares revealed some of the genes that alter expression in response to androgen do contain ares . for the  <dig> genes identified using the cut-off p-value of  <dig>  and 2-fold change in response to androgen, there were eight genes with ares in their promoter, enhancer or intron regions <cit> . ares were detected in the proximity of seven genes by data mining of chip-chip studies of are on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . additionally, sequence analysis of the promoters  <cit>  found eight genes from our gene list to contain potential ares . identification of potential ares in the regulatory regions of the newly identified genes that alter expression in response to androgen  may be directly regulated by ar.

cell-type specificity of gene expression
to determine if expression of candidate genes was unique to lncap cells, we assayed for constitutive levels of expression of  <dig> known and novel candidate genes in prostate cancer cell lines du <dig> <cit>  and pc- <dig> <cit>  using qrt-pcr . genes chosen included those that both increased  and decreased expression in response to androgen . no obvious trends were observed depending on whether expression of the genes increased, or decreased, in response to androgen. all genes tested, except errfi <dig>  were expressed at a lower level in pc- <dig> and du <dig> cells relative to lncap cells. this suggests that the majority of genes that alter levels of expression in response to androgen were enriched in lncap cells relative to pc- <dig> and du <dig> cells. these data are consistent with both du <dig> and pc <dig> cells being androgen-insensitive and lacking a functional ar <cit> .

in vivo changes in gene expression in response to androgen-deprivation
the lncap hollow fibre model combined with qrt-pcr was employed to capture in vivo gene expression representative of physiological levels and castrated levels of androgen . we expected that the genes that had increased levels of expression in vitro in response to androgens, would decrease expression in vivo in response to castration . conversely, we expected that the genes that had decreased levels of expression in vitro in response to androgens, would increase expression in vivo in response to castration. these in vivo results would be consistent with androgen-responsiveness of the candidate genes. of the candidate genes examined,  <dig> of  <dig> genes showed significant changes in gene expression in response to androgen-deprivation . as anticipated, expression of arl6ip <dig>  camk2n <dig>  cxcr <dig>  and st <dig> increased, while cenpn, creb3l <dig>  errfi <dig>  fkbp <dig>  klk <dig>  lrig <dig>  ncapd <dig>  pak1ip <dig>  and taok <dig> decreased levels of expression in response to castration. no significant changes in gene expression in vivo was measured for adamts <dig>  hsp90b <dig>  or prkacb, suggesting that in vivo, other factors may influence their expression. alternatively, the expression kinetics of each specific gene and half-life of its transcript may vary considerably. the time of harvesting samples and measuring changes in expression of genes in response to androgen-deprivation was at  <dig> days in vivo compared to  <dig> hr in vitro in response to addition of androgens . different levels of androgen may also have profound effects on proliferation and differentiation. physiological levels of androgen in male nude mice may be considerably lower than the levels used in vitro. androgen at  <dig> nm inhibits proliferation of lncap cells in vitro while  <dig>  nm is optimal for proliferation <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
androgens are essential for the growth, development and maintenance of the prostate. here, we created longsage libraries to obtain quantitative gene expression profiles of lncap human prostate cancer cells treated with, or without, androgen and revealed the following: 1)  <dig>  tag types in the r <dig> longsage library and  <dig>  tag types in the vehicle longsage library; 2) the majority  of tag types in each longsage library were singletons which may represent very low abundance transcripts ; 3); when mapped tags were clustered and ambiguous mappings were removed, the tag types in the r <dig> and vehicle longsage libraries represented  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  genes, respectively; 4) 53% of tags mapped solely to known exons, 9% solely to known introns , and 38% to intergenic regions ; 5) the most highly abundant longsage tag mapped to human mitochondrial nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain  <dig> involved in metabolic energy; 6) the lower abundance classes were enriched for genes with functions in regulating transcription; 7)  <dig> genes were differentially expressed by two-fold  in response to androgen representing  <dig> % of the total tag types ; 8) some of these genes have confirmed or potential ares; 9) novel androgen regulated genes  identified and validated were arl6ip <dig>  blvrb, c19orf <dig>  c1orf <dig>  c6orf <dig>  camk2n <dig>  ccni, dera, errfi <dig>  glul, golph <dig>  hm <dig>  hsp90b <dig>  manea, nans, nipsnap3a, slc41a <dig>  sod <dig>  svip, taok <dig>  tcp <dig>  tmem <dig>  usp <dig>  and vta1; 9) expression of adamts <dig>  arl6ip <dig>  camk2n <dig>  capns <dig>  cenpn, creb3l <dig>  ccni, cxcr <dig>  fkbp <dig>  hsp90b <dig>  klk <dig>  lrig <dig>  ncapd <dig>  pak1ip <dig>  prkacb, st <dig>  and taok <dig> was increased in lncap cells compared to prostate cancer cells lacking a functional ar; and 10) significant differences in levels of expression of arl6ip <dig>  camk2n <dig>  cenpn, creb3l <dig>  cxcr <dig>  errfi <dig>  fkbp <dig>  klk <dig>  lrig <dig>  ncapd <dig>  pak1ip <dig>  st <dig>  and taok <dig> were measured in vivo in response to androgen-deprivation. the products of these genes are involved in amino acid and protein synthesis, cofactor transport, protein trafficking, response to oxidative stress, as well as signaling pathways that regulate gene expression, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. these genes are potentially critical for the function and maintenance of the prostate and represent targets for clinical intervention.
