BACKGROUND
the identification of breast cancer  gene signatures based on morphology  and two key markers, estrogen receptor  and human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig> , are a challenge for current clinical practice .

however, the landscape of alterations in bc is more complex and heterogeneous. with the introduction of gene expression microarrays and next generation sequencing , additional studies on the molecular classification of bc were carried out. these have led to the identification of four molecular subtypes associated with distinct characteristics, distinct genetic mechanisms of disease and differences in patient survival  <cit> : luminal a, luminal b, triple negative/basal like and her <dig> subtypes  <cit> .

by expression profiling, the large majority of er+ and/or progesterone receptor pgr+ tumours are “luminal subtypes”  <cit> : luminal a and luminal b; they have a relatively good prognosis with the former being typically low grade  <cit> . luminal a is the most common subtype and represents 50 %–60 % of all bc and typically highly expresses regulated gene slc39a <dig> , member 6), transcription factors gata <dig>  foxa <dig> and xbp <dig>  and luminal cytokeratins krt <dig> and krt <dig>  <cit> . luminal b comprises 15 %–20 % of bc and has a more aggressive phenotype and lower survival rates after relapse . it shows an increased expression of proliferation-related genes such as avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog , gamma glutamyl hydrolase , lysosome-associated transmembrane protein 4-beta , nuclease sensitive element binding protein  <dig>  and cyclin e <dig>   <cit> .

for a successful discrimination of luminal-b tumours from luminal-a in clinical practice, cheang et al.  <cit>  suggested an immunohistochemistry proliferation marker, the ki <dig> hormone receptor. the authors determined the ki <dig> cut off point  that discriminates luminal-a from luminal-b tumours. however, ki <dig> immunohistochemistry shows some limitations, such as low intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility, the arbitrary selection of standard antibodies for testing, in addition to potential problems resulting from tumour heterogeneity  <cit> .

concerning the response to therapy of bc subtypes, luminal b responds better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but is less responsive to hormonal therapy than luminal a  <cit> . potential targets in luminal b are insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  signalling, fibroblast growth factor  signalling, phosphoinositide 3-kinase signalling   <cit> .

the interplay between er and insulin-like growth factor  <dig> receptor  shows a critical role in tamoxifen resistance. high circulating plasma levels of igf- <dig>  a ligand for igf-1r, are detected in women with an increased risk of relapse on adjuvant tamoxifen  <cit> .

several studies indicate that the fgf factor, involved in angiogenesis  <cit> , and its receptor fgfr <dig> are amplified in cells resistant to endocrine therapy  <cit> . knockdown of fgfr <dig> and/or the use of a small molecule fgfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor could reverse resistance to endocrine therapy  <cit> .

several methods to interrupt igf- <dig> signalling, fgf signalling, and pi3k have been proposed  <cit> . creighton et al.  <cit>  suggested that the combined effect of endocrine therapy luminal-b bc cell lines and pi3k inhibitor could increase growth inhibition induced by the only endocrine therapy. atzori et al.  <cit>  developed antibodies against igf-1r that block igf- <dig> ligand-mediated activation and small-molecule inhibitors of the igf-1r tyrosine kinase domain.

some antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors against fgfr are currently in clinical testing, such as tki- <dig> single agent, and exemestane  <cit> . agents targeting the pi3k pathway comprise rapamycin analogues or mtor inhibitors  <cit> .

the basal-like subtype, one of the most clinically aggressive groups among the different subtypes, represents 8 %–37 % of all bc, and is the one with highest rate of metastasis to the brain and lung  <cit> . it is more commonly negative for all  <dig> markers—er, pgr, and her2—the “triple-negative” phenotypic classification  <cit> .

there are several other biomarkers associated with the basal subtype as well as putative candidates suitable for immunohistochemical screening .

an association between the basal subtype and germline mutations in the brca <dig> gene, often termed the “caretaker of the genome”, has been well described, and it may be speculated that both inherent dna damage–sensing processes and dna repair mechanisms are central in the development of basal-like tumours . however, currently, there is no specific international agreement on complementary biomarkers that can define basal-like cancers  <cit> .

given the lack of validated molecular targets in basal bc, conventional chemotherapy has been the only therapeutic option for women with this kind of tumour  <cit> . based on brca <dig> mutations, some studies explored the use of platinum chemotherapy agents   <cit> . antiangiogenic therapies targeting vegf and its receptors have emerged as promising therapies given the evidence of aberrant vegf pathway activation in basal bc  <cit> . moreover, small-molecule and antibody-based egfr inhibitors are also explored as targeted therapies  <cit> .

her2-positive  cancer represents 15–20 % of bc subtypes. her2+ confers more aggressive biological and clinical behaviour  <cit> . these tumours present a high expression of the her <dig> gene and of other genes associated with the her <dig> pathway  <cit> .

currently, the treatment in advanced her2+ bc is the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and the chemotherapy agent taxane  <cit> . high expression of her <dig> promotes tamoxifen resistance and the addition of trastuzumab could improve the tamoxifen response  <cit> .

this bc variety has consequences in the diverse clinical behaviour and provides critical insight for the development of personalized therapies.

however, gene expression microarrays and ngs data have many more genes than number of samples, and methods to reduce the dimension of genes in functional units, such as gene sets, pathways, and network modules, have been recently explored  <cit> . these aggregation methods are based on the statement that the set of genes involved in the same biological processes are often collaborative in the development and progression of bc, and show an easier interpretation of the underlying biology  <cit> .

methodologies to identify the set of genes enriched from a genetic signature whose combined expression pattern is that uniquely characteristic of a given phenotype are promising approaches.

alterations of the interplay among pathways leading to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastases are hallmarks of the bc process.

the mitogen activated protein kinase , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , akt and nuclear factor kappa b  are commonly de-regulated in different bc subtypes  <cit> . raf/mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase /extracellular signal-regulated kinase  are critical for normal human physiology, and also commonly dysregulated in several human cancers, including bc  <cit> .

saini et al.  <cit>  suggested, both in vitro and in vivo, that pi3k/akt/mtor and raf/mek/erk cascades are interconnected and the inhibition of one pathway can still result in a deregulation of the other. notch signalling pathway is associated with many oncogenic signalling pathways, such as developmental signals, i.e., wnt and hedgehog signalling, growth and transcriptional factors, cytokines, and oncogenic kinases  <cit> . a review  <cit>  examined the molecular basis of the collaboration and integration of the er, and mapk.

currently, two main approaches have been proposed to identify functional units deregulated in a disease. one approach is to identify de novo functional units from the data. following this approach, van vliet proposed an unsupervised method to identify gene patterns using a score applied to a bayes classifier  <cit> . ma et al.  <cit>  used weighted co expression networks and their module to describe the collaboration among genes.

the other main approaches used existing functional units to build prognostic or diagnostic analysis. abraham et al. proposed features derived from pre-specified gene sets from the molecular signatures database , and, by using a statistical test aggregating the expression levels of all genes within a set, they derived prognostic gene sets  <cit> . huang et al.  <cit>  proposed a new pathway-based de-regulation scoring matrix transforming the gene features in combination with cox regression and l1-lasso regularization to model survivals. a genomic model consisting of fifteen cancer relevant pathways was revealed and validated on three independent bcs.

deregulation of signalling events in a given cancer sample is of great clinical interest in order to identify candidate drugs developed to specifically modulate upstream signalling events  <cit> . recent progress in cancer biology has revealed that mirnas are potential therapeutic targets suggesting the introduction of the mirna mimic oligonucleotides in phase i cancer clinical trials.

oncogenic or tumour suppressive mirnas have been implicated in the regulation of central cellular pathways, such as differentiation and apoptosis, across several tumour types  <cit> , but the discovery of how a mirna regulates its targets in tumour samples is still challenging. recent studies revealed, for instance, that hsa-mir- <dig> is up regulated in bc  <cit> , while hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir-200c have been shown to inhibit metastatic cell invasion  <cit> .

emerging evidence demonstrates that mirnas play an essential role in controlling stem cell properties by regulating, for instance, epithelial to mesenchymal transition   <cit> . emt has a fundamental role in cancer cells with the loss of intracellular junctions and epithelial polarity. several mirnas, such as hsa-let- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir- <dig> are described as regulator of this process  <cit> .

other mirnas have been reported to have an active role in tumour proliferation control. hsa-mir-92a can promote tumour proliferation by controlling the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway  <cit> . several other mirnas were found to be up-regulated in bc; these include the hsa-mir-221/ <dig> cluster  <cit> , hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir10b, hsa-mir-29a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-146a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-520c, and hsa-mir <dig>  <cit> , suggesting their potential use for bc diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic studies  <cit> .

all these findings demonstrate the ability of mirnas to regulate the development of malignancies modulating critical cancer-related genes and signalling pathways.

while many studies demonstrated the role of mirna-target interactions in a single pathway, there are little evidence on the interaction of specific mirnas with genes of different pathways.


hsa-mir- <dig>  whose expression correlates with the her <dig> status  <cit> , has been shown to be significantly down regulated in bc  <cit> . experimentally, the overexpression of hsa-mir- <dig> decreases the expression level of erbb <dig> and erbb <dig>  reducing cell motility and invasiveness of numerous cancers, including bc  <cit> . the let- <dig> regulatory network suppresses metastasis acting on the chromatin-remodelling protein hmga <dig> and the transcription factor bach <dig>  <cit> . both targets promote the transcription of pro-invasive genes that regulate cell invasion and metastasis to the bone  <cit> .

another important mirna in bc is hsa-mir- <dig>  it has been found to be down-regulated in erα-positive bc, both in patient samples and bc cell lines  <cit> , and in lymph node metastatic bc  <cit> . a critical role of hsa-mir- <dig> has been recently demonstrated in the regulation of the 3′ utr of cyclin d <dig>  inducing g <dig> arrest and a decrease in cell proliferation in bc cells  <cit> , thus suggesting a potential role as a tumour suppressor. it has been also shown that hsa-mir- <dig> regulates erα via interaction with its 3′ utr  <cit> , demonstrating a specific function in most aggressive types of bc.

in this work we developed a method to detect mirnas regulating pathway interactions, based on the integration of gene expression profiles and biological pathways and mirnas. we validated the approach in bc subtypes, obtaining, for each bc subtype, a network of pathways enriched from differentially expressed genes. we focused on the pairs of pathways able to differentiate a particular bc subtype with respect to the normal type. mirnas significantly enriched from their gene targets in at least two pathways were found to be key regulators of interacting pathways.

methods
breast cancer subtypes
in our study we focused on four different bc subtypes: luminal a, luminal b, basal, and her <dig> which we compared with normal samples . we considered the expression level of mrnas and mirnas extracted from a tcga bc data set. we performed a quantile analysis on tcga mirnas and mrna, in order to exclude genes and mirnas with a small variance, thus obtaining  <dig> mirnas and of  <dig> genes. we then used bc matched samples mirna-mrna for all the subsequent analyses.

luminal a vs. ns
we used  <dig> bc luminal a samples and  <dig> ns for mrna analysis, and  <dig> bc luminal a samples and  <dig> ns for mirna analysis.

luminal b vs. ns
we used  <dig> bc luminal b samples and  <dig> ns for mrna analysis, and  <dig> bc luminal a samples and  <dig> ns for mirna analysis.

basal vs. ns
we used  <dig> bc basal samples and  <dig> ns for mrna analysis, and  <dig> bc basal samples and  <dig> ns samples for mirna analysis.

her <dig> vs. ns
we used from  <dig> bc her <dig> samples and  <dig> ns for mrna analysis, and  <dig> bc her <dig> samples and  <dig> ns for mirna analysis.

grouping and bootstrapping analysis
we performed an analysis based on several boots, with each boot consisting of four steps and working on different  training and testing data sets.

in order to perform bootstrapping, we implemented a classifier based on monte carlo cross validation, that randomly splits a part of the original data in the training data set  and the rest of original data in the testing set . the first, second and third step are performed on the training data set, the fourth step both on the training and testing data set.

in order to avoid problems of unbalanced classes of bc and ns, we randomly selected classes with the same number of bc and ns in both the training and testing dataset.

differentially expressed genes: 1st step
differentially expressed genes between each subtype class of bc samples and class of ns were identified by statistical analysis using the function tcgaanalyze dea from the package tcgabiolinks from bioconductor. the following parameters were used: quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood, abs >  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig>   <cit> . the obtained p-values were adjusted by using the benjamin-hochberg procedure for multiple testing correction  <cit> .

pathways enriched from differentially expressed genes: 2nd step
given  <dig> pathways derived from the ingenuity pathway analysis  database, a pathway enrichment analysis was applied. the enrichment was evaluated using the fisher’s exact test between differentially expressed genes and ipa pathways. we considered a pathway to be enriched if p-value was < <dig> .

interacting pathways: 3rd step
interactions among the enriched pathways were quantified by an interaction score , defined as: is=mx−my/sx+sy where mx, sx, my and sy represent the mean and the standard deviation of expression levels of genes in pathways x and y, respectively. maximum cross-talk was found for is near  <dig> 

for every comparison , we obtained a matrix of is, with each raw corresponding to each bc sample and each column corresponding to is related to each pair of significantly enriched pathways.

identification of the best pathways for breast cancer subtype classification: 4th step
for every comparison , for the training data set, we used the matrix of is to classify the class of bc samples and ns. we used random forest algorithm  from the r-package  <cit> , setting the following parameters: number of variables randomly sampled at each split = sqrt, p being the number of variables in the matrix of data; and the number of trees grown =  <dig>  in order to validate the classifier, we used a k-fold cross-validation  obtaining area under the curve .

we thus selected the  <dig> pairwise pathways with the best auc in the classification of the different bc subtypes vs ns.

we finally validated the classification using the top  <dig> pairwise pathways and the same k-fold cross-validation on the testing data set in terms of auc.

the four steps described above were repeated multiple times .

specifically, each bootstrap generated from a training dataset i)  <dig> step: a list of differentially expressed genes, ii)  <dig> step: a list of pathways significantly enriched by differently expressed genes, iii)  <dig> step: a subtype-specific matrix of is for each pair of pathways significantly enriched, and iii)  <dig> step: the top  <dig> pairwise pathways with the best auc performance.

in conclusion, for each subtype and for all  <dig> bootstraps, we obtained the 10x <dig>  pairwise pathways with the best aucs., from which we selected, by ranking their frequency, the top  <dig> pairwise pathways.

mirnas regulating the top  <dig> pairwise pathways
mutual information  was applied between the dataset of  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> genes, providing a linking index between mirnas and genes. mi was calculated using entropy estimates from k-nearest neighbour distances  <cit>  with the r-package parmigene  <cit> . in this step we obtained a list of candidate target genes for each mirna.

in order to link mirnas with the top  <dig> pairs of pathways, we applied a fisher’s exact test between candidate target genes  and genes within each pairwise pathway . we thus identified a group of mirnas regulating the top  <dig> pairwise pathways . then, we focused only on those mir-r differentially expressed between each bc subtype and ns . figure  <dig> shows the proposed procedure.fig.  <dig> proposed approach

discussion
in a normal condition the biological pathways act in a coordinated way to collaborate in a biological process. cancer can interfere in these coordinated processes, since alterations in multiple genes that participate in different pathways result in an uncontrolled growth of tumour cells, invasion and metastases.

in this work, by assessing the coordination among different pathways deregulated in bc subtypes, we observed key pairwise pathways for each bc subtype, which enabled the identification of a network of dependent pathways characteristic of the disease. furthermore, we identified mirnas that control this network with a potential role in bc. these mirnas could be crucial modulators of upstream signalling events linked by specific subtype of bc.

mirnas regulating pathways in luminal a
in bc luminal a we identified  <dig> mirnas  which could be key modulators of six pairs of pathways: 1) intrinsic prothrombin activation, and extrinsic prothrombin activation; 2) acute phase response signalling, and hif <dig> signalling 3) axonal guidance signalling, and acute phase response signalling; 4) ethanol degradation iv, and glioma invasiveness signalling; 5) ethanol degradation iv, and estrogen receptor signalling; and 6) glioma invasiveness signalling, and oxidative ethanol degradation iii.

intrinsic prothrombin activation and extrinsic prothrombin activation, regulated by hsa-mir-99a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-1537
intrinsic and extrinsic prothrombin activation pathways perform an essential role in coagulation, an important process for the establishment of metastasis also in experimental models of cancer  <cit> .


hsa-mir-99a has been already associated with bc; in particular, its up regulation correlates with cells with stemness properties  <cit> . moreover, hsa-mir-99a has been identified in a screening of mirna profiles able to discriminate ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive bc, metastatic bc and normal tissues. hsa-mir-99a shows specific differential expression in the in situ subtype of bc  <cit> . among the other mirnas regulating the two above mentioned pathways, hsa-mir- <dig> is one of the possible circulating mirnas able to discriminate between blood samples of patients with bc and nc  <cit> . hsa-mir- <dig> was demonstrated to be a potential predictor of the outcome of different cancers, including bc  <cit> . circulating hsa-mir- <dig> levels were associated with trastuzumab sensitivity, tumour presence, and lymph node metastases, suggesting hsa-mir- <dig> as a predictor and perhaps a monitor of the response to therapies including trastuzumab  <cit> .

limited data about hsa-mir- <dig> is available for this mirna. few publications, not related to bc, described this mirna as altered in the serum and bile of cholangioma patients  <cit> , where a speculation of a role for hsa-mir- <dig> in inflammation is proposed.

acute phase response signalling and hif <dig> signalling, regulated by hsa-mir-205
the acute phase response is a rapid inflammatory response that provides protection against infections, including cancer  <cit> . several studies found cross-talk between hif- <dig> signalling and inflammatory pathways suggesting that the development of inflammation in response to hypoxia is clinically relevant  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> is an oncosuppressive mirna lost in bc; it is directly transactivated by the oncosuppressor p <dig>  <cit> . sempere et al.  <cit>  showed that hsa-mir- <dig> expression is restricted to the myoepithelial/basal cell compartment of normal mammary ducts and lobules, and is reduced or completely eliminated in matching tumour specimens. hsa-mir- <dig> regulates a number of important oncogenic targets as zeb <dig>  vegfa, and her <dig>  moreover, it may modulate additional targets, such as hmgb <dig>  showing a potential therapeutic benefit/role  <cit> .

axonal guidance signalling and acute phase response signalling, regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-99a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-1250
we found that two pathways, axonal guidance signalling and acute phase response signalling, are regulated by a group of  <dig> mirnas.

there are four families of secreted or membrane-bound factors with repulsive or attractive activities for growing axons and migrating neurons , which have recently emerged as pivotal factors in tumour progression. far from being confined to the developing brain, axonal guidance signalling seems to play an important role in tumour cell migration, tumour cell survival and tumour angiogenesis  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> has already been proposed as a circulating biomarker of the response of the bc luminal a subtype to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> is down regulated in cancer stem cells  targeting genes, such as bmi <dig> and suz <dig> component, zeb1/ <dig>  and klf <dig>  all belonging to a regulatory circuit that sustains the breast csc state  <cit> . hsa-mir- <dig> could be used as prognostic marker  <cit>  and could suppress neuroblastoma cell invasiveness by directly targeting multiple genes from the non-canonical tgf- β signalling pathway  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> plays a role in the reduction of gastric cancer cell invasion capacity and its loss has been associated with lymph node metastasis  <cit> . furthermore, a study in prostate cancer revealed hsa-mir- <dig> as a potential circulating biomarker able to identify risk groups  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> has been found to be associated with adriamycin-resistance of bc cells, at least, partially, by targeting the insulin-like growth factor- <dig> receptor   <cit> , and contributes to the docetaxel resistance of bc cells  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> has been described in the white matter tracts of the human brain. although no publication is available regarding its role in bc, hsa-mir- <dig> seems to perform a role in oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation  <cit> .

ethanol degradation iv, and glioma invasiveness signalling regulated by hsa-mir-3199-1
looking to the list of genes in ethanol degradation iv, we found that a lot of these genes belong to the family of aldh genes, and, although as they perform a role in ethanol detoxification, they are also considered biomarkers of cscs  <cit> .

er+ cells are able to generate cell progeny of luminal lineage both in vitro and in vivo. loss of aldh isoform, aldh1a <dig>  plays a role in this process by weakening cellular differentiation  <cit> . several studies demonstrated that aldh1a <dig> correlates with er status in bc, and that aldh1a <dig> is an independent predictor of poor clinical outcome  <cit> .

looking at the list of genes involved in glioma invasiveness signalling, we found several genes such as itgb <dig>  belonging to the integrins family, the integrin signalling members  or some members of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  signalling . integrins comprise a large family of cell surface receptors and control cell attachment to the extracellular matrix , growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cell motility, migration and survival. a role for integrins in bc development has been already described  <cit> . rhoh and rhou proteins have a critical role in the tumour progression and invasion, being important for the transduction of the signal from integrins to the neighbourhood cell during cell-cell communication  <cit> . the pi3k signalling pathway in bc is associated with the poor outcome luminal b subtype, as its activation leads to the development of endocrine therapy resistance  <cit> .

as regards hsa-mir-3199- <dig>  no publication is available on bc or on other cancer types.

ethanol degradation iv and estrogen receptor signalling, regulated by hsa-mir-1-1
we have already previously discussed the role of genes comprised in the list of ethanol degradation iv pathway.

as regards the pathway of estrogen receptor signalling, ers are critical regulators of breast epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. nowadays the role of er pathway in bc malignancy development is quite clear. this is the reason why several therapeutic approaches have been directed against er+ bc  <cit> .


hsa-mir-1- <dig> has been demonstrated to be a tumour suppressor gene that represses cancer cell proliferation and metastasis and promotes apoptosis by ectopic expression  <cit> . hsa-mir-1- <dig> regulates downstream functions of oncogenic signalling pathways such as met, hdac <dig>  pim- <dig>  wnt, cyclin d, foxp <dig>  slug, and tagln <dig>  <cit> . down regulation of hsa-mir-1- <dig> was found to be associated with colorectal cancer progression  <cit> .

glioma invasiveness signalling, and oxidative ethanol degradation iii regulated by hsa-mir-3199-1
as regards the pathway of glioma invasiveness signalling, we have already discussed the role of its genes previously.

looking at the list of genes involved in oxidative ethanol degradation iii, regulated by hsa-mir-3199- <dig>  we found some isoforms of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  protein. pi3k includes two subunits, p85α and p110α, that are mediators of the pro-survival pi3k/akt pathway signalling. some isoforms of pi3k as well as p <dig> subunit have been already described in her2-positive bc patients, responding to trastuzumab treatment  <cit> . among the other genes, particularly interesting if the finding of itgb <dig>  an integrin belonging to a family of six genes , which control cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and play an important role in mediating cell proliferation, migration and survival  <cit> . a strong association between integrin expression, mutation or polymorphism and bc onset has been already described  <cit> .

the two described pathways seem to be controlled by a common mir, hsa-mir-3199- <dig>  no publication is currently available about the function of this mirna in any biological processes.

mirnas regulating pathway in luminal b
in bc luminal b, we identified  <dig> mirnas , which could be key modulators of the pair of pathways epithelial adherens junction signalling - eif <dig> signalling.

epithelial adherens junction signalling and eif <dig> signalling regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-577
adherens junctions are specialist structures for cell-cell adhesion machinery. the adhesive process is directly related to the differentiation and normal development of the tissue  <cit> . the development of cancer represents a modification of normal tissue homeostasis and a change in cell-cell interaction. in addition, cancer metastasis spreads through the circulatory system due to cell adhesion  <cit> .

eif <dig> signalling is an essential factor for translation initiation and protein synthesis. no study showed a correlation between these pathways.


hsa-mir- <dig> is located in genomic regions, which might be involved in malignancies via deletion, amplification, or epigenetic modification mechanisms  <cit> . it regulates phosphatase and tensin homologue  expression, and promotes proliferation, migration and invasion in colorectal cancer  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> has been associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma  <cit> , but no publication is available about its role in bc.


hsa-mir- <dig> is mainly involved in proliferation control in glioblastoma  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  and in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . it is possible to hypothesise a role for hsa-mir- <dig> also in bc proliferation control.

mirnas regulating pathway in basal
in bc basal, we identified  <dig> mirnas  that may play an important role in the regulation of three pairs of pathways: 1) ethanol degradation iv, and mismatch repair in eukaryotes; 2) putrescine degradation iii, and role of brca <dig> in dna damage response, and 3) tryptophan degradation x , and role of brca <dig> in dna damage response.

ethanol degradation iv and mismatch repair in eukaryotes, regulated by hsa-mir-135b
mismatch repair plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability. cells possess multiple mechanisms to repair dna damage and thus prevent mutations  <cit> . no study revealed a direct interaction between ethanol degradation iv, and mismatch repair in bc.


hsa-mir-135b levels are elevated in a variety of cancers including bc  <cit> . lowery et al.  <cit>  identified a 15-mirna predictive signature related to the expression of er comprising also this mirna . up regulation of hsa-mir-135b is more robust in highly invasive than less invasive lines. in colorectal cancer, hsa-mir-135b promotes cancer progression by acting as a downstream effector of oncogenic pathways  <cit> .

putrescine degradation iii, and role of brca <dig> in dna damage response regulated by hsa-mir-365-2
putrescine is a known metabolite that plays an important role in cancer and cscs  <cit> . putrescine belongs to the class of polyamine, involved in numerous processes in normal and cancer cells, such as proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cell interactions, and angiogenesis  <cit> . an association between the basal subtype and brca <dig> gene has been well described, and it may suggest that both inherent dna damage–sensing processes and dna repair mechanisms are crucial in the development of basal-like tumours  <cit> .


hsa-mir-365- <dig> negatively regulates bcl <dig> protein levels, and its overexpression combined with the deregulation of other  <dig> mirnas have an apoptotic effect thus suggesting a therapeutic potential  <cit> . in pancreatic cancer hsa-mir- <dig> was found to induce gemcitabine resistance by targeting the adaptor protein shc <dig> and pro-apoptotic regulator bax  <cit> .

tryptophan degradation x , and role of brca <dig> in dna damage response regulated by hsa-mir-365-2
altered tryptophan metabolism is linked to cancer development and progression  <cit> . in particular, indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase  <dig> , an enzyme involved in tryptophan degradation, has been documented to have therapeutic potential, alone or in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy  <cit> . several studies confirmed its immunosuppressive role and the inhibition of the ido <dig> pathway therefore represents a promising therapeutic approach. clinical trials evaluating the first ido <dig> inhibitors have already started  <cit> . the role of hsa-mir- <dig> in cancer has been already reported above.

mirnas regulating pathway in her2
in her <dig> bc, we identified  <dig> mirnas  that may have an important role in the regulation of seven pairs of pathways: 1) axonal guidance signalling; cxcr <dig> signalling; 2) axonal guidance signalling; p2y purigenic receptor signalling, 3) role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis; growth hormone signalling, 4) hif <dig> signalling; growth hormone signalling, 5) hif <dig> signalling; glioblastoma multiforme signalling, 6) acute phase response signalling; hif <dig> signalling, and 7) atherosclerosis signalling; acute phase response signalling.

axonal guidance signalling and cxcr <dig> signalling, regulated by hsa-mir-148b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-449c, hsa-mir-584
the role of axonal guidance signalling in cancer has already been mentioned above. cxcr <dig> signalling shows a down regulation in metastasised bc cells  <cit> . cxcr <dig>  the receptor for stromal-derived factor- <dig>  is already reported as involved in breast carcinogenesis and invasion. recent studies showed that the inhibition of cxcr <dig> expression resulted in an anti-invasive effect revealing the potential for the treatment of bc  <cit> .


cxcr <dig>  the receptor of sdf- <dig>  plays a crucial role in modulating axonal responsiveness through a cyclic nucleotide-dependent signalling pathway  <cit> .

four mirnas could be important regulator of this interaction.


hsa-mir-148b was found to be a major coordinator of malignancy influencing invasion, survival to anoikis, extravasation, lung metastasis formation, and chemotherapy response  <cit> . circulating hsa-mir-148b was validated and found elevated in the plasma of bc patients compared to healthy women  <cit> . cimino et al.  <cit>  showed that hsa-mir-148b expression enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.


hsa-mir- <dig> was associated with lymph node metastasis and its increased expression inhibited cell migration and invasiveness. the target of hsa-mir- <dig> was protease-activated-receptor  <dig> , which is a metastasis promoting protein in several cancers  <cit> .


hsa-mir-449c showed a decreased expression in human gastric tumours and induces senescence and apoptosis by activating the p <dig> pathway  <cit> . no information is reported about hsa-mir-449c and bc.


hsa-mir- <dig> was found to be down-regulating tgf-β in bc cells. phactr <dig>  an actin-binding protein, is also regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  overexpression of hsa-mir- <dig> and knockdown of phactr <dig> resulted in a drastic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and in a loss of tgf-β-induced cell migration  <cit> .

axonal guidance signalling and p2y purigenic receptor signalling pathway, regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-92b
the role of axonal guidance signalling in cancer has already been mentioned above. a recent study showed that p2y purigenic receptor signalling pathway is included in a potential pathway signature for testing gemcitabine -based chemotherapies sensitivity of gallbladder cancer patients  <cit> .

p2y receptors  have strong direct effects on the tumour by modulating cell growth. in vivo data support in vitro evidence that lowering the intratumour adenosine concentration and targeting the p2x <dig> receptor have a strong antitumour effect  <cit> . no study showed a direct interaction between axonal guidance signalling and p2y purigenic receptor signalling.


hsa-mir- <dig> has already been discussed above. as regards hsa-mir- <dig>  the involvement of this mirna in the pathway controlled by tgf-β  <cit>  has been already described. in particular, tgf-β is able to decrease the expression of hsa-mir- <dig>  this in turn leads to the increase of protein phosphatase and actin regulator  <dig> , a protein required for tgf-β-induced cell migration of breast cancer cells  <cit> . the drastic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is important in axonal guidance signalling, playing a role in tumour cell migration, tumour cell survival and tumour angiogenesis.


hsa-mir-92b, regulating these pairwise pathways, was found over-expressed in brain primary tumours, suggesting a functional link between neuronal stem cells and brain tumourigenesis  <cit> . the involvement of this mirna in radiation resistance was also found  <cit> .

role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis and growth hormone signalling, regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-511-2
tumours comprise proliferating tumour cells and stromal cells, including endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, and fibroblasts  <cit> .

macrophages play a crucial role in the innate and adaptive response to pathogens. recently, it was also found that tumour-associated macrophages interact with cscs thus leading to tumourigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance  <cit> . as regards hsa-mir-511- <dig>  several publications demonstrated that this mirna plays an important role in modulating tumour-associated macrophages. the upregulation of hsa-mir- <dig> affects the pro-tumoural gene signature of tumour-associated macrophages, which are endowed with tissue-remodelling, proangiogenic, and protumoural activity  <cit> .

hormones play an important role for normal development and possibly also for tumour formation in the mammary gland. human growth hormone could also stimulate the tumour initiating capacity and metastasis of estrogen receptor-negative bc  <cit> . hsa-mir- <dig> plays a role as potent inhibitor of human growth hormone signalling in normal and cancer cells thus suggesting the development of mirna inhibitors as therapeutic agents in growth hormone-related disease, including cancer  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig>  described as oncomir, is implicated in emt, cell migration, and invasion control. roth et al.  <cit>  found hsa-mir- <dig> in the serum of patients with bc and not in healthy controls; this mirna has been used to monitor the effect of taxane treatment on bc. sun et al. observed the decreased expression of hsa-mir- <dig> in serum after chemotherapy, which reached levels comparable to those of healthy subjects  <cit> .

hif <dig> signalling and growth hormone signalling, regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-429
resistance to hormonal therapy is still unknown, but hypoxia could play an important role, for instance, in down-regulating er-alpha expression as well as er-alpha function in bc cells  <cit> . furthermore, hypoxia and estrogen are interchangeable as both similarly modulate epithelial-endothelial cell interaction  <cit> .

previous studies showed the role of hsa-mir- <dig> as potential drug resistance in ovarian cancer  <cit>  and as a potential novel biomarker for diagnosing of colorectal cancer  <cit> .

down regulation of hsa-mir- <dig> was highlighted in the 3d culture-specific mirna profile better than that in the 2d culture-specific profile, by correlating with the 3d invasive capacity of the mda-mb- <dig> bc cell line  <cit> .


hsa-mir- <dig> could be also a regulator of hif <dig> signalling, glioblastoma multiforme, acute phase response signalling and hif <dig> signalling.

hif <dig> signalling and glioblastoma multiforme signalling regulated by hsa-mir-190b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-429
the role of hif <dig> signalling in cancer has already been mentioned above. as regards glioblastoma multiforme signalling pathway, among all the altered genes in common with hif <dig> signalling pathway, the main genes are those of the ras family , already found mutated in triple-negative bc  <cit> , the genes of the pi3k pathway , which has been already found silenced or mutated in aggressive bc  <cit> , and those of the serine/threonine protein kinase family, like atm, already associated with hormone negative early stage bc  <cit> .

as regards mirnas able to regulate these couples of pathways, we identified hsa-mir- <dig> , hsa-mir-190b and hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-190b is indicated as a higher discriminating mirna between er+ and er- bc. this mirna has also an impact on metastasis-free survival and event-free survival rates, independently of er status  <cit> . hsa-mir- <dig> was included in a 5-mirna signature with good diagnostic features, able to discriminate between healthy and early stage bc samples  <cit> .

acute phase response signalling and hif <dig> signalling regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-3617
the role of hif <dig> signalling in cancer has already been mentioned above. acute phase response signalling has a clear role in both er+ and triple negative bc  <cit> . looking to the genes involved in acute phase response signalling in common with those of hif <dig> signalling, they belong to the map kinase pathway  or to the ras protein family , as discussed above. hsa-mir- <dig> has already been discussed. as regards hsa-mir- <dig>  no publication is currently available about the function of this mirna in any biological processes.

atherosclerosis signalling and acute phase response signalling regulated by hsa-mir-1910
the acute phase response signalling plays a clear role in bc, as already mentioned. there are only a few publications that associate atherosclerosis signalling to bc. however, one of the main molecule involved in tissue remodelling and in atherosclerosis is tenascin-c. its serum level of expression has no predictive or prognostic ability in bc, although it is elevated in bc patients  <cit> . as regards mirnas involved in the control of this couple of pathways, we identified a single mirna, hsa-mir- <dig>  this mirna is included in a group of  <dig> mirnas, whose silencing by methylation leads to the onset of bc  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified pairwise pathways for bc subtypes able to discriminate bc vs. normal samples. from these pairs, we created a network of pathways specific for each subtype. following an enrichment analysis, we focused on mirnas with an important role in the regulation of the network.

in the network of pathways for bc luminal a, we found  <dig> mirnas: hsa-mir-1- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-3199- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-99a. among them, hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir- <dig> have a potential therapeutic role, acting as biomarkers of the response to trastuzumab, and to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively.

in the network of pathways for bc luminal b, we found  <dig> mirnas: hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir- <dig>  among them, hsa-mir- <dig> has been already associated with cancer progression.

in the network of pathways for bc basal we found  <dig> mirnas: hsa-mir-135b, and hsa-mir-365- <dig>  among them, hsa-mir-365- <dig> showed an apoptotic role and could play a therapeutic role.

in the network of pathways for her <dig> bc, we found  <dig> mirnas: hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-148b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-190b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-449c, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-511- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-92b. among them, hsa-mir-148b, hsa-mir-92b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig> are interesting for drug design, as a role in the response to different therapeutic strategies has been already described.

the identification of a network of dependent pathways and their regulatory mirnas is a current challenge in order to have an overview of a complex disease such as cancer. in particular, mirnas, once validated in a laboratory assay, could be suitable for translation to a clinical environment. the low-cost procedures and the possibility to be measured by non-invasive tests make mirnas important diagnostic and therapeutic tools for further studies.
