BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are ubiquitous components in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. they constitute the largest part of some of them  <cit> , and play an important role in their evolution  <cit> . genome sequencing has shown that te sequences constitute about 15% of the drosophila melanogaster genome  <cit> , about 45% of the human genome  <cit> , and up to 90% of the genomes of some plants  <cit> . why species harbor such different proportions of tes is still unknown, but it may be related to the reproductive characteristics and population size of the host  <cit> , and to environmental stresses  <cit>  that may influence te dynamics. various different mechanisms may prevent genome invasions by tes, ranging from dna deletions  <cit>  to epigenetic control mechanisms, such as chromatin conformation  <cit> .

several studies have shown that genomes harbor a mixture of tes, some of which are still active, whereas others are ancient relics that have degenerated  <cit> . degraded elements can result from point mutations or from dna deletion  <cit> . deletions may occur either by recombination, which is common to all classes of elements, or as a consequence of the transposition mechanism of the specific element concerned. for instance, the latter occurs in line elements , which are retroelements that use an rna intermediate to transpose  <cit> . their transposition mechanism leads to 5' end truncations of the new inserted sequence. considerable internal deletions have previously been reported in the inactive copies of several non-ltr retrotransposons  <cit> , and this deletion mechanism seems to act at an high rate, since sequences that are similar at the nucleotide level may have very different internal deletions  <cit> .

one example of this type of te evolution is the retrotransposon helena, which is a  <dig>  bp line  <cit>  first reported in the d. virilis species  <cit> , and later identified in all the species analyzed in the melanogaster subgroup, as well as in d. pseudoobscura  <cit> . helena has been shown to be present at different stages of its life-cycle in natural populations of d. melanogaster and d. simulans. only degenerate copies were found in d. melanogaster  <cit> , whereas in d. simulans several different types of sequences have been identified, ranging from highly degenerate to putatively active ones  <cit> . the analysis of helena in these two closely-related species has shown how important the host genome can be in the evolution of a te, and how important it is to analyze specific te families in a wide spectrum of species. this is possible now that the genome sequences of  <dig> drosophila species  <cit>  are available, and helena can be considered to provide an ideal model system for investigating te evolution across a range of species.

we investigated the evolution of helena sequences using a combination of experimental and population analyses with sequence analyses of the  <dig> drosophila genomes, and we propose a possible scenario for the evolution of the element in the different host genomic environments that influence the "fate" of tes.

RESULTS
identification and analysis of reference copies
using the full-length copy of helena already identified in the draft sequence of the d. simulans genome  <cit> , and  <dig> reverse transcriptase  fragments of the melanogaster species group  <cit> , we performed a search for helena-like elements in the other  <dig> drosophila genomes. we identified helena reference sequences in all the genomes , apart from d. pseudoobscura, d. persimilis, d. willistoni and d. grimshawi . the results of blast analyses in d. pseudoobscura, d. persimilis and d. willistoni revealed only short sequences  with percentage identities to the bs element that were higher than or similar to those to helena . bs is a previously-described line element that belongs to the same "jockey clade" as helena  <cit> . sequences equally distant from bs and helena have also been reported in d. melanogaster, and it has suggested that they may constitute a new family, named helena/bs  <cit> . we did not therefore classify these sequences as helena elements, and performed no further analysis of them. our results for d. pseudoobscura are not consistent with previous data reported by petrov et al.  <cit> , who isolated just one sequence in this species. however, we should note that the same strains were not used in these two studies, and this could explain the differing results. we did not detect any helena sequences in d. grimshawi, which is consistent with the fact that this a te-poor genome  <cit> , but in all the other species the selected reference copies we examined all contained one or two open reading frames  .

the d. sechellia reference sequence  is  <dig>  bp long, and contains several of the hallmarks of helena-related elements that have already been characterized: a  <dig> bp poly-a tail, and two overlapping open reading frames . the first orf is  <dig>  bp, and the second  <dig>  bp long. both orfs are interrupted by three premature stop codons, and the pol-like protein contains only the reverse transcriptase domain.

in the other species in the melanogaster group, the reference copies are smaller than the helena reference copy in d. simulans. in d. erecta  and d. ananassae , the orf <dig> and orf <dig> are separated by sequences of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively, but both species contain the apyrimidic endonuclease, the exonuclease and the reverse transcriptase domains . in d. yakuba  and d. virilis  the reference copies consist only of a small orf <dig>   <dig>  bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively.

the reference copy of d. mojavensis is the only putatively active helena-like element identified in the species analyzed . it is  <dig>  bp long, and harbors two overlapping orfs without premature stop codons. the first orf is  <dig>  bp long, and potentially encodes a  <dig> aa protein. the second is  <dig>  bp long, and could encode a  <dig> aa protein. moreover, the gag-like protein contains a conserved pre_c2hc domain, and the pol-like protein contains the three domains required for its function: an apyrimidic endonuclease, an exonuclease and a reverse transcriptase domain. however, the poly-a tail was not identified.

genomic sequence analyses
the helena copy number for each species is presented in table  <dig>  this number varies considerably between the species, ranging from seven in d. erecta to  <dig> in d. sechellia, with sizes ranging from  <dig> bp  to  <dig>  bp . the average percentage identity of the copies with the reference within each species ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . size-divergence between these copies results from the presence of indels that occur throughout the sequences . no relationship can be inferred between the size and the percentage identity, since copies with small sizes display an identity level as high as the larger ones . this may be expected when considering only the 5' truncations, produced by the transposition mechanism of helena. however, the different copies reported here are also internally deleted, and can be expected to be old relics of helena, with more neutral mutations than the full-length copies. the only exception concerns d. sechellia, in which significant correlation between size of the copies and identity was detected. this is probably due to the large number of copies detected in this species.

helena-related sequences form a monophyletic clade  that includes a well-defined cluster of the species of the melanogaster subgroup . the other group contained d. ananassae, d. virilis and d. mojavensis. this phylogeny is typical for a te with vertical transmission.

analysis of the activity in natural populations
since our in-silico analyses show that only d. simulans and d. mojavensis harbor full-length, putatively active copies, we performed southern blot analyses on several populations of these two species to infer their te activity . our results show that these species display insertion polymorphism, suggesting that helena is active. we cannot of course exclude the possibility of restriction fragment length polymorphism, which would lead to the same kind of result. the qrt-pcr experiments on these two species show that helena is highly expressed in d. mojavensis, which displayed population variability that contrasted with that of d. simulans, in which the levels of expression were much lower . we were only able to compare the helena transcripts, because the housekeeping gene  used to normalize qrt-pcr is equally expressed in both species .

discussion
this study describes the evolutionary dynamics of the helena non-ltr retrotransposon in the sequenced drosophila genomes. we have shown that helena occurs in d. sechellia, d. yakuba, d. erecta and d. ananassae , in d. mojavensis  and in d. virilis , as well as in d. melanogaster and d. simulans, which had been studied previously  <cit> . in d. pseudoobscura, d. persimilis and d. willistoni, the small copies that we found displayed similar percentage identities to helena as to bs, a non-ltr retrotransposon related to helena. sequences with the same kind of similarity have been reported in d. melanogaster, and were grouped by the authors as helena/bs family  <cit> . the d. pseudoobscura, d. persimilis and d. willistoni sequences we found can be included in this family. we agree with the suggestion that there could be members of the helena/bs family in these species as shown in d. melanogaster  <cit> , and so we did not include them in our study. the  <dig> bp sequence of helena that had been previously described  in a strain  of d. pseudoobscura  <cit>  was not found in the sequenced genome of this species. our phylogenetic analysis shows that helena is a monophyletic group of sequences patchily distributed in the species of the two subgenera of the genus drosophila . taking our data together with those from other authors  <cit> , we can conclude that helena was present in the common ancestor of the drosophila genus, and has been vertically transmitted to the derived lineages, but subsequently lost in some of them, or at least diverged so much as to escape detection. the high variability in copy number and sequence degeneration in the different species shows that the evolutionary dynamics of helena depends on the genomic environment, as has already been reported for other retrotransposons, such as tirant  <cit> .

recent work has reported the presence of deteriorated and inactivated helena in the d. melanogaster genome, but also of a full-length copy in d. simulans carrying all the structures required for activity, and with a high level of insertion polymorphism in the natural populations  <cit> . this suggests that in this species helena is either still active or has been active until recently. in our analysis, all the reference copies in the other  <dig> drosophila genomes were found to be devoid of intact orfs, except in d. mojavensis. in this species, two copies of helena contain intact orfs, which suggest that full-length and potentially active helena sequences could exist. this means that this species may offer a unique opportunity for studying the evolutionary dynamics of helena.

our analysis of the copy numbers reveals a strikingly variable distribution of helena in the  <dig> species. in d. sechellia,  <dig> copies of helena were observed, whereas in d. erecta only seven copies were identified. even though these genomes have not been well annotated, and there are some low quality sequences that could bias copy number estimation, this should not invalidate the tendency identified. it has been proposed that effective population size could be one of the main factors accounting for differences in copy number of tes  <cit> , with selection against tes being less effective in smaller populations  <cit> . this seems to apply to d. sechellia. this species is restricted to the seychelles islands in the indian ocean, and is the most specialized fly within the melanogaster group. it has a very low effective population size  <cit> , and carries the highest number of helena sequences recorded . we would expect to find a similar scenario for d.erecta, which is also a specialized species with a small population size  <cit> . however, as has also been observed for the mariner element, the observed copy number of helena is not in fact consistent with this hypothesis  <cit> . this means that other factors may be affecting the copy number of tes, including genomic and environmental features.

we did not observe any major differences in copy number between the two species of the drosophila subgenus, even though d. mojavensis has a higher copy number than d. virilis. what is more striking is that the only potentially full-length active copies identified were detected in d. mojavensis, together with the other potentially active copy previously described in d. simulans  <cit> . the southern blot analyses of several natural populations of d. mojavensis and d. simulans suggest that helena has recently displayed transpositional activity. however, we confirmed that the transcriptional activity is low in d. simulans, as had previously been suggested  <cit> , and this clearly indicates that helena is being lost in this species. in d. mojavensis, the situation is completely different. we have observed high levels of helena transcripts in several populations, confirming its activity. moreover, expression varied between different populations, indicating that helena must be present at different stages of its evolutionary cycle, i.e. different stages of activity, in different populations within this species.

our analysis has shown that the evolution of helena is influenced by the host species, resulting in differences in copy number, degradation and activity. in all the species analyzed, d. mojavensis is the only one in which the helena has survived, which gives us a unique opportunity to observe the "fate" of this te. however, it is crucial to investigate natural populations from this and other species in the repleta group in order to find out how widespread the scenario described here actually is, and to understand the process and speed of the degradation and extinction of helena.

CONCLUSIONS
here we show that six species of drosophila have helena transposable elements at different stages of its evolution, and may represent different stages of the te evolutionary cycle. the copy number is highly variable in different species, but most of them are truncated at the 5' ends and display several internal deletions and insertions. in all the species analyzed, helena has only survived in d. mojavensis, and this gives us a unique opportunity to track the "fate" of this te.
