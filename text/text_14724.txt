BACKGROUND
nuclear retinoid receptors are retinoid-induced transcription factors that mediate a wide array of cellular functions including growth, differentiation, and cell death. while the role of these receptors in immune function has been recognized early, it is only recently that retinoids have been identified to play a crucial role in t lymphocyte physiology like regulatory t cell development and suppression of inflammatory th <dig> cells  <cit> . our understanding of the mechanism of retinoid receptor function in t cells is however, not well defined. our previous studies have provided some insights in the functioning of these receptors and have identified the relevance of epigenetic mechanisms in modulating their function during t cell signaling  <cit> .

a major signaling event during t cell activation is the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and immunological synapse  formation. these events are crucial for downstream signaling that culminates in effector functions and cytokine production  <cit> . recent studies have identified cfl <dig>  an actin binding protein, as an essential component of t cell activation that is crucial for is formation and t cell activation. most of the cfl <dig> in naive t cells is found in the inactive phosphorylated form that following tcr activation, involving accessory receptors, is dephosphorylated into an active form  <cit> . the active form of cfl <dig> binds actin and regulates f-actin dynamics. serine/threonine kinase limk <dig> and phosphatases pp <dig>  pp2a, slingshot 1l , and chronophin  are known to regulate the phosphorylated state of cfl <dig>  <cit> .

hiv- <dig> gains entry into t cells by the interaction of viral proteins with receptors and co-receptors. this interaction leads to the perturbation in actin dynamics and viral replication. recent studies have identified cfl <dig> as a central player in regulating the modification of the actin cytoskeleton by hiv- <dig> proteins gp <dig> and nef  <cit> . nef is known to interact with actin and modify actin cytoskeletal dynamics and the t cell receptor initiated signaling cascade. nef has been also shown to inhibit is formation and cell spreading by modifying actin function  <cit> . there is ample evidence that actin plays a functional role in nuclear transcription and disturbances in actin dynamics affect transcriptional outcome  <cit> . we have reported earlier that t cell activation silenced transcription driven by nuclear retinoid receptors and induced silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors -receptor interaction . we also identified a dynamic balance between jnk and erk pathways in modulating retinoid-receptor function . the mechanism by which t cell activation induces loss of transcription is still not completely understood. in this report we have focused our studies to investigate the role of actin cytoskeleton homeostasis and dynamics in nuclear retinoid receptor-mediated transactivation. our results indicate a critical role of limk1-mediated cfl <dig> pathway and actin dynamics in retinoid receptor function. the data suggest that changes in the actin cytoskeletal dynamics may indeed contribute to the loss of nuclear retinoid receptor function following t cell activation.

RESULTS
f-actin-modifying chemicals attenuate retinoid receptor-mediated transcription
one of the outcomes of t cell activation is remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton crucial for the formation of is. we have previously shown that t cell activation inhibits nuclear retinoid receptor mediated function  <cit>  raising the possibility that actin modification may have a role in such inhibition. to confirm the role of actin dynamics in transcriptional activation we studied the effect of actin modifying agents on receptor function. jurkat cells were transfected with rxre reporter plasmid and after incubation for  <dig> h treated for  <dig> h with 9-cis retinoic acid or vehicle in the presence of latrunculin a , swinholide a ; chemicals that prevent f-actin formation, or jasplakinolide  a compound that induces f-actin formation and stabilization. all these inhibitors were found to attenuate ligand independent and ligand-dependent transcription . we used sp1-luc reporter plasmid as a control as the transcription driven by this promoter was not significantly affected by these agents . these results demonstrate that f-actin dynamics and assembly are critical for retinoid receptor-mediated transcription.

cfl <dig> plays a critical role in regulating retinoid receptor function via establishing dynamic balance between f-actin stabilization and disassembly
cfl <dig> is known to play a central role in maintaining actin cytoskeletal dynamics by severing f-actin and allowing for re-organization and formation of new filaments  <cit> . since our data suggested that retinoid receptor function is sensitive to changes in f-actin organization, we explored the possibility that cfl <dig> may play an important role in retinoid receptor activation by knocking down cfl <dig> protein and testing for retinoid receptor-mediated activation. jurkat cells were transfected with reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of a control sirna or cfl <dig> specific sirna. western blot analysis showed a nearly 75% knockdown of cfl <dig> protein in cells transfected with cfl <dig> specific sirna as compared with cells transfected in the absence of sirna or control sirna . when the lysates were tested for luciferase activity there was significant reduction in activity in cells transfected with cfl1-specific sirna as compared with cells transfected in the absence of sirna or the presence of control sirna . these results indicate that cfl <dig> is essential for retinoid receptor-mediated transcription. to further study the role of cfl <dig> in retinoid receptor activation we overexpressed cfl <dig> in jurkat cells and studied its effect on transcription. the results obtained  show that overexpression of cfl1/wt reduced transcriptional activation in a dose dependent manner. taken together, knockdown and overexpression data indicate that retinoid receptor-mediated transcription is sensitive to the changes in the levels of cfl <dig> expression and any decrease or increase in the levels of cfl <dig> results in the loss of transcriptional activity.

f-actin severing activity of cfl <dig> is regulated by phosphorylation of the serine residue at amino acid position  <dig>  whereas non-phosphorylated cfl <dig> binds and severs f-actin, phosphorylated cfl <dig> is inactive and its accumulation leads to the increase in f-actin content  <cit> . expression of the s3a mutant of cfl <dig> generates a protein that is not phosphorylatable and hence is constitutively active. in contrast, the s3e mutant of cfl <dig> mimics phosphorylated cfl <dig> and also functions as dominant-negative protein  <cit> . to identify the role of s <dig> phosphorylation in cfl1-regulated retinoid receptor function, jurkat cells were transfected with reporter plasmid in the presence of cfl1/wt, cfl1/s3a, and cfl1/s3e plasmids. surprisingly, expression of both mutants of cfl <dig> inhibited transcription in a dose dependent manner  similar to the inhibition by cfl1/wt described above. the inhibition was more pronounced with s3a and s3e mutants as compared to cfl1/wt; the s3e mutant was most inhibitory of the three. we used sp1-luc reporter plasmid as a control and studied the effect of cfl1/wt, cfl1/s3a, and cfl1/s3e expression on its activity. the data  show that the sp <dig> activity was not affected by the expression of either wt or cfl <dig> mutants. to study the changes in the f-actin levels after transfection with cfl1/wt, cfl1/s3a, and cfl1/s3e plasmids, the cells were stained with anti-v <dig> tag antibodies followed by treatment with f-actin stain. the cells were visualized  and the levels of f-actin quantified  using immunofluorescent microscopy. the results show that cells transfected with cfl1/wt and cfl1/s3a plasmids showed lower levels of f-actin as compared to cells not expressing the plasmid with cfl1/s3a expressing cells exhibiting lowest f-actin levels. in contrast cells transfected with cfl1/s3e plasmid showed accumulation of f-actin and expressed significantly higher levels of f-actin as compared to non-transfected cells.

together, these results show that while cfl <dig> is essential for retinoid receptor function, when expressed at higher levels both active and inactive forms inhibit transcription. in other words, cfl <dig> regulates retinoid receptor dependent transcriptional homeostasis by maintaining a dynamic balance between f-actin stabilization and disassembly mediated by the inactive phosphorylated and the active non-phosphorylated forms of the protein.

cfl <dig> kinase limk <dig> regulates retinoid receptor mediated activation
limk <dig> is a threonine/serine protein kinase, a member of the lim kinase  family that is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization and microtubule disassembly. although a number of proteins have been identified that are known to interact with limk <dig>  cfl <dig> is the only known substrate for the enzyme. limk <dig> modulates actin dynamics by phosphorylating and inactivating cfl <dig> leading to the accumulation of f-actin <cit> . the role of limk <dig> in the nuclear retinoid receptor function is unknown. based on our observation that cfl <dig> plays a crucial role in regulating retinoid receptor function, we next explored the role of limk <dig> in retinoid receptor function. as shown  the overexpression of limk1/wt in jurkat cells inhibited retinoid receptor mediated transcription in a dose dependent manner. a limk <dig> mutant limk1/d460a is a kinase dead mutant that also functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of limk <dig> <cit> . transfection of jurkat cells with reporter plasmid in the presence of limk1/d460a mutant plasmid also inhibited transcription driven by retinoid receptors in a dose dependent manner . we used sp1-luc reporter plasmid as a control and studied the effect of limk1/wt, and limk1/d460a expression on its activity. the data  show that the sp <dig> activity was not significantly affected by the expression of the wt or mutant limk <dig>  together, these results suggest that the steady state levels of limk <dig> are important for normal retinoid receptor function. when overexpressed, limk <dig> functions as a negative regulator of retinoid receptor-mediated transcription. the inhibition of transcription exhibited by the expression of inactive and dominant negative limk1/d460a mutant provides further evidence for the importance of the steady state levels of the limk <dig> enzyme in regulating normal receptor function. because overexpression and inhibition of limk <dig> will induce hyperphosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cfl <dig>  respectively, any changes in the activity of cfl <dig> disturb receptor-mediated transcription. thus limk1-mediated cfl <dig> homeostasis is crucial for receptor function. to investigate if the transfection of limk1/wt and limk1/d460a plasmids induce changes in the f-actin levels, the transfected cells were stained with anti-v <dig> tag antibodies followed by staining with f-actin stain. the cells were visualized  and the levels of f-actin quantified  using immunofluorescent microscopy. the results show that cells transfected with limk1/wt plasmid showed significant accumulation and higher levels of f-actin as compared to cells not expressing the plasmid. in contrast, cells transfected with limk1/d460a plasmid expressed lower f-actin levels as compared to non-transfected cells. these data are consistent with the ability of limk1/wt expression to induce phosphorylation and inactivation of cfl <dig> resulting in the accumulation of f-actin, whereas expression of limk1/d460a has the opposite effect of increasing active cfl <dig>  and inducing loss of f-actin. together, these data indicate that limk <dig> functions as a critical regulator of retinoid receptor transcription by regulating f-actin homeostasis.

actin modifying hiv- <dig> nef protein attenuates retinoid receptor-mediated transcription
recent studies have identified cfl <dig> as a central player in regulating the modification of the actin cytoskeleton by hiv- <dig> proteins gp <dig> and nef  <cit> . nef is known to interact with actin and modify actin cytoskeletal dynamics and the t cell receptor initiated signaling cascade. nef also has been shown to inhibit is formation and cell spreading by modifying actin function  <cit> . nef functions by binding to the cell membrane and incorporation into lipid rafts through myristoylation. we first studied the effect of wild-type  and myristoylation  mutant of hiv- <dig> nef on f-actin assembly using immunofluorescence microscopy. jurkat cells were transfected with nef/wt and nef/g2a plasmids and  <dig> h later stained with anti-nef antibody and f-actin specific fluorophore-labeled phalloidin. as shown in figure 4a expression of wt but not g2a mutant of nef induced loss of characteristic f-actin ring assembly in these cells. next, we investigated the effect of nef on retinoid receptor mediated transcription. jurkat and pbt cells transfected with either rxre or rare containing luciferase-based reporter plasmids in the presence of nef-expressing plasmid showed a significant loss of reporter activity when compared to cells transfected with a non-expressing nef control plasmid .

sp1-luc reporter was used a control as nef did not have significant effect on the activity of this promoter . to study if the t cell activation signals synergized with nef in inhibiting transcription, cells were transfected with nef expressing plasmid in the presence of antibodies to t cell receptors cd <dig> and cd <dig> or treatment with pma+pha . the data show that activation significantly enhanced nef induced loss of receptor activity. in order to identify the role of myristoylation, g2a mutant of nef was then tested in reporter assays. the results show  that loss of myristoylation significantly reduced the ability of nef to induce inhibition. next, we studied the effect of f-actin-modifying chemicals on transcriptional activation in the presence of nef to see if the latter cooperated with the chemicals in inhibiting transcription. jurkat cells were transfected with reporter plasmid either in the presence of nef/wt or nef/stop plasmids for  <dig> h followed by treatment with chemicals. the results  demonstrate that nef is significantly more inhibitory in the presence of actin-modifying chemicals. nef cooperating with actin-modifying chemicals points to the modulation of f-actin assembly as a possible mechanism for nef-induced inhibition of transcriptional activation.

nef inhibits the expression of cellular genes containing retinoid receptor binding sites in their promoters
nef was also found to inhibit rxre or rare containing luciferase-based reporter activity in hek- <dig> cells  indicating that nef inhibition of retinoid receptor function is not limited to t cells alone. to confirm the data obtained by the reporter assays and identify retinoid receptor-dependent cellular genes that are inhibited by nef expression, we transfected  <dig> cells with nef/stop and nef/wt plasmids and the effect on cellular transcriptome was analyzed by gene array. the data identified that nef inhibited the expression of five genes that contain retinoid receptor binding sites in their promoters . ifit <dig>  cebpb, and crabp <dig> are known retinoic acid inducible genes  <cit> whereas rbm8a and acot <dig> were found to contain dr <dig>  and dr <dig>  consensus sequence elements, respectively, within their promoter regions upstream of the transcription start site. real-time rt-pcr was used to confirm the inhibition of gene expression.

 <dig> cells were transfected with nef/stop and nef/wt plasmids for  <dig> h. total rna was isolated and processed for gene array as described in experimental procedures. five genes whose expression was significantly inhibited by nef were identified to be either known retinoic acid-inducible genes or contained rar/rxr binding sites in their promoters. ifit <dig>  cebpb, and crabp <dig> were found to be known retinoic acid-inducible genes whereas. rbm8a and acot <dig> were found to contain putative rare  and rxre  sites respectively in their promoter regions upstream of the transcription start site. the inhibition of gene expression was validated by real-time rt-pcr.

nef inhibition of retinoid receptor function is mediated by limk1-dependent cfl <dig> pathway
limk <dig> functions with cfl <dig> to control the assembly of actin. to understand the mechanism of nef-induced modulation of actin-dynamics and nuclear receptor-mediated function, we next investigated the possibility that overexpression of nef could regulate cfl <dig> activity by modifying the level of cfl <dig> phosphorylation. these studies were performed in  <dig> cells that also exhibited f-actin changes after transfection with nef . cells were transfected with plasmids expressing nef/wt or nef/g2a mutant. western blot analysis of the extracts collected after  <dig> hr of transfection showed that cells transfected with nef/wt expressed significantly higher levels of phosphorylated cfl <dig> as compared to cells transfected with control or nef/g2a plasmids . the levels of total cfl <dig> remained unchanged. these data show that nef induces cfl <dig> phosphorylation and myristoylation of nef protein is crucial for this activity of nef.

we next explored the effect of nef on cfl <dig> phosphorylation using immunofluorescence microscopy.  <dig> cells were transfected with either flag-tagged nef/wt or flag-tagged nef/g2a plasmids. after  <dig> h cells were stained with anti-flag and anti-phospho cfl <dig> antibodies. microscopic study revealed that nef expression induced morphological changes in  <dig> cells. although still attached to the surface, nef-expressing cells appeared more rounded in shape than cells not expressing nef or cells that expressed the g2a mutant of nef . in addition, nef-expressing and rounded cells showed significantly higher levels of phospho-cfl <dig> staining as compared to cells not expressing nef and cells expressing the g2a mutant protein . these results confirm western blotting results that expression of the myristoylated form of nef induces cfl <dig> phosphorylation.

based on our findings in this study that overexpression of the cfl <dig> kinase limk <dig> inhibits retinoid receptor-mediated transactivation and nef induces phosphorylation of cfl <dig>  it was logical to hypothesize that nef attenuates retinoid receptor mediated activation by inducing the activation of limk <dig> which in turn increases cfl <dig> phosphorylation. to test the hypothesis that nef induces activation of limk <dig>  we transfected  <dig> cells with either flag-tagged nef/wt or flag-tagged nef/g2a plasmids for  <dig> h and studied limk <dig> phosphorylation at thr <dig>  phosphorylation at thr <dig> is known to activate the limk <dig> enzyme  <cit> . immunofluorescence analysis of the transfected cells using antibodies specific to phospho-limk <dig>  revealed that nef expressing cells, that also showed the "rounding off" phenotype, exhibited significantly higher levels of phospho-limk <dig> staining as compared to cells not expressing nef . in contrast, cells expressing the g2a mutant protein that did not show the "rounding off" phenotype, exhibited phospho-limk <dig> levels similar to the cells not expressing the nef protein. these results confirm the hypothesis that nef induces the activation  of limk <dig>  in addition, the data also reveal that myristoylation of nef is necessary to induce the "rounding off" phenotype and activation of limk.

discussion
the actin cytoskeleton undergoes major changes during t lymphocyte migration, antigen-driven activation, apoptosis, and infection with retroviruses  <cit> . these events result in the activation of various signaling components that are assembled and brought into the close proximity by the actin cytoskeleton. actin cytoskeletal homeostasis also regulates gene expression by modulating chromatin remodeling, mrna processing, and nuclear export  <cit> . thus actin pathways regulate cellular functions by the dual processes of modulating signaling and also directly participating in nuclear transcription. it is known that retinoid receptor function is attenuated during t cell activation  <cit> , a phenomenon that involves actin remodeling, suggesting that actin modification may play a role in such inhibition. in this study we set out to investigate the role of actin cytoskeleton homeostasis and dynamics in retinoid receptor-mediated transcription. latrunculin a, swinholide a, compounds that prevent f-actin formation, or jasplakinolide, a chemical that induces f-actin formation and stabilization, were all found to attenuate transcription to various levels. these results point out the importance of actin homeostasis in retinoid receptor-mediated activation and indicate that any disturbances in actin dynamics and the f-actin homeostasis attenuate retinoid receptor-dependent transcription. electrophoretic mobility shift assay did not reveal any significant loss of rare or rxre probe binding activity in response to f-actin modifying agent  suggesting that mechanisms other than the effect on dna binding are involved in transcriptional inhibition induced by f-actin disruption.

cfl <dig> is a key f-actin remodeling protein that severs f-actin and thereby allows addition and assembly of new actin filaments, the so-called actin-treadmilling  <cit> . both sirna-mediated knockdown and overexpression of cfl <dig> attenuated retinoid receptor function showing that cfl <dig> homeostasis plays a critical role in receptor activity. this was further evident from the data obtained with constitutively active  and inactive/dominant-negative  mutants of cfl <dig>  whereas the transfection of cells with cfl1/wt and s3a mutant induced loss of f-actin content in the cells expressing these proteins, transfection with s3e mutant increased f-actin content consistent with the ability of wt and s3a mutant to severe f-actin and s3e mutant to increase f-actin content. loss of transcriptional activation by the expression of s3a and s3e mutants of cfl <dig>  in addition to cfl1/wt, further emphasizes the importance of actin homeostasis in the regulation of retinoid receptor-mediated transcription.

interestingly, cfl <dig> overexpression has also been shown to negatively regulate glucocorticoid receptor function  <cit>  and thrombin-induced nf-kappab activity  <cit>  suggesting that cfl <dig> homeostasis is also essential for the activities of steroid hormone-mediated nuclear receptors as well as other transcription factors besides retinoid receptors reported in this study.

the role of limk <dig> in the regulation of nuclear hormone receptor-dependent activation is unknown. here we have shown that when overexpressed limk <dig> functions as a negative regulator of retinoid receptor function. the expression of an enzymatically inactive d460a mutant of limk <dig>  that also functions as a dominant-negative protein, also inhibited receptor activity. these data suggest that physiological levels of limk <dig> are crucial for receptor function due to its ability to regulate cfl <dig> and actin cytoskeletal homeostasis. overexpression of limk <dig> and loss of limk <dig> activity  increased and decreased f-actin content respectively, and deregulated actin dynamics and homeostasis so crucial for retinoid receptor activity.

a number of previous studies have demonstrated that nef expression disturbs f-actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . we confirmed these observations in this study and found that nef expression induced loss of the characteristic actin ring structure. in addition, we report that nef inhibited retinoid receptor mediated transcription. the gene array analysis of nef-transfected  <dig> cells identified inhibition of endogenous expression of a number of genes that contain retinoid receptor binding sites in their promoters. ifit <dig>  cebpb, and crabp <dig> are known retinoic acid inducible genes  <cit>  whereas rbm8a and acot <dig> were found to contain dr <dig>  and dr <dig>  consensus sequence elements, respectively, within their promoter regions upstream of the transcription start site.

the role of myristoylation in reducing the receptor function correlated well with the inability of this nef mutant to induce loss of f-actin ring structure. the conclusion that the nef-mediated loss of transcriptional activation is a consequence of disturbance in the actin dynamics was supported by the observation that the presence of nef exhibited a cooperative effect on the loss of transcription induced by the actin-modifying agents. these data show that retinoid receptor mediated transcription is tightly controlled by actin cytoskeletal homeostasis and any disturbances in f-actin dynamics that may include changes in f-actin architecture, length, and content affect receptor-driven transcription.

in order to gain further insight to understand the role of actin pathways in modulating retinoid receptor-mediated function, we next studied the mechanism by which nef inhibits actin dynamics. we have shown that cells expressing nef had higher levels of phospho-cfl <dig> suggesting a link between nef mediated phosphorylation of cfl <dig> and inhibition of retinoid receptor-mediated activation. by inhibiting cfl <dig> activity nef protein disturbs f-actin homeostasis that is crucial for normal retinoid receptor function. nef induced phosphorylation of cfl <dig> has also recently been reported by others  <cit>  indicating that modification of cfl <dig> activity is an important mechanism by which nef modulates actin-cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular functions. the mechanism underlying the phosphorylation of cfl <dig> by nef is not known. although phospho-cfl <dig> appears to colocalize with nef , but nef did not interact with cfl <dig> in immunoprecipitation experiments . since nef lacks any kinase activity, phosphorylation of cfl <dig> by nef is probably induced due its activation and association with other kinases and/or adapter proteins like vav. nef has been reported to associate with p- <dig> associated kinases   <dig> and  <dig> and induce activation of these serine/threonine kinases  <cit> . paks are effectors of rac and cdc <dig> gtpases that are known for their role in actin dynamics. pak <dig> is an upstream kinase for limk <dig> that binds and activates limk <dig> by phosphorylating thr <dig> within the activation loop, resulting in a marked increase in its activity to phosphorylate cfl <dig>  <cit> . in fact treatment of jurkat cells with pak inhibitor ipa <dig> was able to induce retinoid receptor transcription and reduce p-cfl <dig> levels  indicating that pak-mediated cfl <dig> phosphocycling plays an important role in retinoid receptor function.

the ability of nef to inhibit transcription and induce cfl <dig> phosphorylation suggested that nef might function by activating limk <dig> thereby inducing cfl <dig> phosphorylation. data presented here support this hypothesis and demonstrated that the expression of myristoylated nef induced significant phosphorylation of limk <dig> at thr <dig>  how nef induces phosphorylation of limk <dig> is not known but nef-mediated activation of pak <dig> that is known to directly phosphorylate limk <dig>  <cit>  remains a possibility. we also found that expression of nef induces the "rounding off" phenotype in cells that is indicative of cell cycle changes seen in mitotic cells  <cit> . this rounding phenotype induced by nef was associated with increased phospho-cfl <dig> and phospho-limk <dig> levels . although a number of previous studies have shown that there is a transient net change in the phospho-cfl <dig> levels and increase in the phospho-limk <dig> levels during mitosis and cytokinesis  <cit> , but our cell cycle studies did not reveal any significant changes in the number of cells in mitotic phase in cells transfected with nef . it is possible that the "rounding off" phenotype seen in this study may reflect the morphological changes in cells due to disturbance in f-actin dynamics and not the presence of mitotic cells.

our data strongly indicates that nef is a modulator of limk <dig> and cfl <dig> phosphorylation that modifies the function of these two proteins and inhibits retinoid receptor transcription by interfering in actin architecture. this is further emphasized in our overexpression data using various cfl <dig> and limk <dig> mutants that induce loss of transcription and disturbance in the actin dynamics. data obtained with nef protein not only confirm the role of actin dynamics in retinoid receptor transcription, but also provide mechanistic information. although we cannot rule out the possibility that hiv-nef inhibits receptor function through additional mechanisms besides modifying cfl <dig> phosphocycling, modification of actin dynamics by nef and the crucial role of actin homeostasis in receptor function provide evidence that nef inhibits receptor function largely by inhibiting actin dynamics.

in conclusion, we have described a critical role of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics in normal retinoid receptor-mediated function and found that limk1-mediated phosphocycling of cfl <dig> plays a crucial role in maintaining actin homeostasis and receptor activity. our studies however, do not rule out the importance of limk <dig> in retinoid receptor function. we have identified hiv- <dig> nef protein as an inhibitor of receptor function by virtue of its limk1-meditaed cfl <dig> modifying activity and used it as tool to study the importance of actin dynamics in receptor function. further studies are needed to identify the mechanism by which disturbances in actin dynamics directly alter the ability of retinoid receptors to activate transcription in the nuclear compartment. a number of studies have demonstrated that nuclear actin exists in dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and polymeric forms, indicating that polymerization of monomeric g-actin is an essential feature of actin dynamics in the nucleoplasm  <cit> . a recent report has shown that most of the g-actin pool in the nucleus is bound to cfl suggesting the importance of cfl in the regulation of nuclear function  <cit> . limk <dig>  <cit>  and cin are known to have nuclear functions  <cit> .

cfl <dig> is an essential component of t cell activation process and is crucial for is formation. most of the cfl <dig> in naive t cells is found in the inactive phosphorylated form that following tcr activation, is dephosphorylated into an active form  <cit> . our previous studies have revealed that retinoid receptor function is inhibited during t cell activation  <cit>  suggesting that actin modification may play a role in such inhibition. data presented here strongly suggests that changes in the actin cytoskeletal dynamics may indeed contribute to the loss of nuclear retinoid receptor function following t cell activation. future studies should reveal the relationship between cfl1-mediated is formation and modulation of retinoid receptor function.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a critical role of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics in retinoid receptor-mediated function and shown that limk1-mediated phosphocycling of cfl <dig> plays a crucial role in maintaining actin homeostasis and receptor activity. we have identified hiv- <dig> nef protein as an inhibitor of receptor function by virtue of its limk1-meditaed cfl <dig> modifying activity and used it as tool to study the importance of actin dynamics in receptor function. our previous studies have revealed that retinoid receptor function is inhibited during t cell activation suggesting that actin modification may play a role in such inhibition. data presented here strongly suggests that changes in the actin cytoskeletal dynamics may indeed contribute to the loss of nuclear retinoid receptor function following t cell activation.
