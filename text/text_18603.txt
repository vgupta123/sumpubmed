BACKGROUND
epidemic influenza is responsible for between  <dig>  and  <dig>  global deaths annually, with influenza a  having caused the bulk of human mortality and morbidity  <cit> . influenza a  has continually circulated within the human population since its introduction in  <dig>  exhibiting recurrent seasonal epidemics in temperate regions and less periodic transmission in the tropics. during this time, h3n <dig> influenza has continually evolved both genetically and antigenically. most antigenic drift is thought to be driven by changes to epitopes in the hemagglutinin  protein  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the relationships among ha sequences has revealed a distinctive genealogical tree showing a single predominant trunk lineage and side branches that persist for only  <dig> to  <dig> years before going extinct  <cit> . this tree shape is indicative of serial replacement of strains over time; h3n <dig> influenza shows rapid evolution, but low standing genetic diversity.

this observation has remained puzzling from an epidemiological standpoint. antigenic evolution occurs rapidly, and strong diversifying selection exists to escape from human immunity; why then do we see serial replacement of strains rather than continual genetic and antigenic diversification? indeed, simple epidemiological models show explosive diversity of genotype and phenotype over time  <cit> . previous work has sought model-based explanations of the limited diversity of influenza, relying on short-lived strain-transcending immunity  <cit> , complex genotype-to-phenotype maps  <cit> , or a limited repertoire of antigenic phenotypes  <cit> .

experimental characterization of antigenic phenotype is possible through the hemagglutination inhibition  assay, which measures the cross-reactivity of ha from one virus strain to serum raised against another strain  <cit> . the results of many hi assays can be combined to yield a two-dimensional map, representing antigenic similarity and distance between strains as an easily visualized and quantified measure  <cit> . the path traced across this map by influenza a  from  <dig> until present is largely linear, showing serial replacement of one strain by another; there are no major bifurcations of antigenic phenotype  <cit> .

herein, we seek to simultaneously model the genetic and antigenic evolution of the influenza virus. we represent antigenic phenotypes as points in a n-dimensional euclidean space. based on the finding that a two-dimensional map adequately explains observed antigenic distance between strains  <cit> , we begin with antigenic phenotypes as points on a plane, but relax this assumption later on in the analysis. after exposure to a virus, a host's risk of infection is proportional to the euclidean distance between the infecting phenotype and the closest phenotype in the host's immune history. mutations perturb antigenic phenotype, moving phenotype in a random radial direction and for a randomly distributed distance. we implemented this geometrical model in a large-scale individual-based simulation intended to directly model the antigenic map and genealogical tree of the global influenza population. the simulation includes multiple host populations with different seasonal forcing, hosts with complete immune histories of infection, and viruses with antigenic phenotypes. as the simulation proceeds, infections are tracked and a complete genealogy connecting virus samples is constructed. results shown here are for simulations of  <dig> years of virus evolution in a population of  <dig> million hosts.

RESULTS
antigenic evolution and genealogical patterns
the virus persists over the course of the 40-year simulation, and at the end of most simulations, there remain only a few closely related viral lineages, indicating that genealogical diversity is restricted by evolution in the two-dimensional antigenic landscape. reduced diversity is substantially more common in models with less mutation or models with less variable mutation effects . at higher mutation rates, viruses may move apart in antigenic phenotype too rapidly for competition to always eliminate the weaker of two diverging lineages. similarly, with high variance in mutational effect, there can sometimes emerge new antigenic types, too distant from the existing population to suffer limiting competitive pressure. both these scenarios lead to coexistence of multiple antigenic phenotypes. we thus restrict the model to parameter regimes with lower mutation rates and lower mutation effect variances. we primarily focus on the model with 10- <dig> mutations per infection per day and mutation effects with a standard deviation of  <dig>  antigenic units. in this model,  <dig> out of the  <dig> replicate simulations show reduced genealogical diversity . we conditioned the following analysis on these  <dig> simulations, compiling summary statistics across this pool and presenting a detailed analysis of a single representative simulation.

the model exhibits annual winter epidemics in temperate regions and less periodic epidemics in the tropics . across replicate simulations, we observe average yearly attack rates of  <dig> % in temperate regions and rates of  <dig> % in the tropics, comparable with estimated attack rates of influenza a  of 3% to 8% per year  <cit> . over the course of the simulation, the virus population evolves in antigenic phenotype exhibiting, at any point, a handful of highly abundant phenotypes sampled repeatedly and a large number of phenotypes appearing at low abundance . the observed antigenic map of h3n <dig> influenza includes substantial experimental noise; replicate strains appear in diverse positions on the observed map. by including measurement noise on antigenic locations , we approximate an experimental antigenic map of h3n <dig> influenza . over the 40-year simulation, antigenic drift moves the virus population at an average rate across replicate simulations of  <dig>  antigenic units per year, corresponding closely to the empirical rate of  <dig>  units per year  <cit> . the appearance of clusters in the antigenic map comes from the regular spacing of high abundance phenotypes combined with measurement noise. over time, clusters of antigenically similar strains are replaced by novel clusters of more advanced strains . across replicate simulations, clusters persist for an average of  <dig>  years, measured as the time it takes for a new cluster to reach 10% frequency, peak, and decline to 10% frequency. the transition between clusters occurs quickly, taking an average of  <dig>  years.

remarkably, although antigenic phenotype is free to mutate in any direction in the two-dimensional space, selection pressures force the virus population to move in nearly a straight line in antigenic space . across replicate simulations, 94% of the variance of antigenic phenotype can be explained by a single dimension of variation. this mirrors the empirical results showing a largely linear antigenic map for h3n <dig> influenza isolates from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . because of the primarily one-dimensional movement, antigenic distance from the original phenotype increases nearly linearly with time . antigenic evolution occurs in a punctuated fashion; periods of relative stasis are interspersed with more rapid antigenic change . antigenic and epidemiological dynamics show a fundamental linkage so that large jumps of antigenic phenotype result in increased rates of infection .

the genealogical tree connecting the evolving virus population appears characteristically sparse with pronounced trunk and short-lived side branches . this tree shape is reflected in low levels of standing diversity; across replicates, an average of  <dig>  years of evolution separates two randomly sampled viruses in the population. this result matches well with the average diversity observed in influenza a  of  <dig>  years, separating randomly sampled contemporaneous viruses  <cit> . a spindly genealogical tree is indicative of population turnover, wherein novel antigenic phenotypes continually replace more primitive 'spent' phenotypes, purging their genealogical diversity. in general, natural selection reduces effective population size and genealogical diversity  <cit> .

selective pressures can be examined by comparing which mutations fix, that is, incorporated into the progenitor trunk lineage, and which mutations are lost, that is, incorporated into side branches bound for extinction. this approach has shown that, in influenza a , natural selection promotes mutations to epitope sites in the ha <dig> region  <cit> . by examining antigenic mutations, we find a corresponding effect in simulated evolutionary trajectories . additionally, we find that trunk mutations occur at strikingly regular intervals, with less variation of waiting times than expected under a simple random process . there is a relative scarcity of mutation events occurring in intervals under  <dig> year and a relative excess of mutation events occurring in 2- to 3-year intervals . this pattern arises from clonal interference between competing mutations which reduces variability in the fixation process of adaptive substitutions  <cit> .

spatial dynamics
the genealogical tree also contains detailed information on the history of migration between regions. we find that, consistent with empirical estimates  <cit> , the trunk resides primarily within the tropics, where seasonal dynamics are less prevalent . across replicate simulations, we observe 72% of the trunk's history within the tropics and 28% within temperate regions. with symmetric host contact rates and equal host population sizes, and without seasonal forcing, we would expect trunk proportions of one third for each region. we calculated rates of migration based on observed event counts across replicate simulations, separating region-specific rates on side branches from region-specific rates on trunk branches. we find that migration patterns on side branches are close to symmetric, with similar rates between all regions, while migration patterns on trunk branches are highly asymmetric, with high rates of movement between temperate regions and from temperate regions into the tropics . extrapolating from these rates, we arrive at an expected stationary distribution of trunk location of 76% tropics and 24% temperate regions, in line with the observed residency patterns of the trunk. it may at first seem counterintuitive to see higher rates of movement from the temperate regions into the tropics along trunk branches, but it makes sense when thought of in terms of conditional probability. only those lineages that remain in the tropics, migrate into the tropics, or which rapidly migrate between the north and south have a chance at becoming the trunk lineage, while lineages that remain within the temperate regions are doomed to extinction. along similar lines, adams and mchardy  <cit>  use a modeling approach to show the importance of nonseasonal transmission to the evolution of the virus.

these findings suggest that persistence and migration are fundamentally connected and have important implications for future phylogeographic analyses. russell et al.  <cit>  emphasize a source-sink model of movement of the ha protein of influenza a  based on their finding of a trunk lineage residing within china and the southeast asian tropics, whereas bedford et al.  <cit>  emphasize a global metapopulation model based on phylogenetic inference of migration rates across the entire tree. our results suggest that both scenarios are simultaneously possible; side branches may be highly volatile, moving rapidly and symmetrically between regions, while the trunk lineage may be more stable remaining within a region  that has more persistent transmission. in light of these results, we suggest that future work on the phylogeography of influenza take into account trunk vs. side branch differences in migration patterns.

correspondence between model and data
in our model, antigenic evolution is driven by the appearance of novel antigenic variants that best escape existing human immunity. although multiple epidemiological/evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed to explain the restricted genetic diversity and rapid population turnover of influenza a   <cit> , our results show that a simple model coupling antigenic and genealogical evolution exhibits broad explanatory power. we find a strong correspondence between the antigenic and genealogical patterns generated by our model  and patterns of genetic and antigenic evolution exhibited by influenza a   <cit> . our model simultaneously captures seasonal attack rates, the rate and pattern of antigenic drift, genealogical diversity, and geographic migration patterns.

our model predicts that detailed classification of influenza strains will support a relatively small number of predominant phenotypes. rather than each influenza strain possessing a unique antigenic location, many strains group together with shared antigenic phenotypes . we suggest that a large proportion of intra-cluster variation in the observed antigenic map is due to experimental noise rather than each strain possessing a unique antigenic location. the relationship between figure 2b,d illustrates this effect, where a large number of antigenic locations emerge from a comparatively small number of unique antigenic phenotypes. additionally, our model accurately predicts the contrasting dynamics of other types/subtypes of influenza. we find that lowering mutation size/effect or lowering intrinsic r <dig> results in decreased incidence, slower antigenic movement, and greater genealogical diversity, all distinguishing characteristics of h1n <dig> influenza and influenza b .

the historical record of influenza evolution suggests that bifurcation of viral lineages is rare, but possible. we have observed no bifurcations in h1n <dig> influenza from  <dig> to  <dig> and again from  <dig> to  <dig>  no bifurcations in h2n <dig> influenza from  <dig> to  <dig>  and no bifurcations of h3n <dig> influenza from  <dig> to  <dig>  we have observed one bifurcation in influenza b from  <dig> to  <dig>  thus, ignoring differences between influenza types and subtypes, we have very roughly observed a rate of one major bifurcation in  <dig> years of evolution. in our model, in  <dig> out of  <dig> replicate simulations, we observe a deep bifurcation in the viral genealogy, which translates to observing one deep bifurcation in  <dig> years of evolution. thus, we suggest that the  <dig> of  <dig> simulations where deep branching occurs are not necessarily evidence of poor model t. similar to koelle et al.  <cit> , we assume that although the historical evolution of h3n <dig> influenza followed the path of a single lineage, it could have included a major bifurcation.

in our model, when antigenic phenotype remains static, there may be multiple consecutive seasons without appreciable incidence , a pattern apparently absent from h3n <dig> influenza  <cit> . additionally, we observe antigenic trajectories that are more linear and deterministic than the highly clustered trajectory observed by smith et al.  <cit> . we suggest that any model exhibiting punctuated evolution broadly consistent with the punctuated change seen in the experimental antigenic map will show similar patterns of incidence. we can 'fix' the incidence patterns but at the cost of too smooth an antigenic map . evolutionary patterns of the neuraminidase  protein may provide an explanation. epitopes in the ha and na proteins are jointly responsible for determining antigenicity  <cit> , and it is now clear that levels of adaptive evolution are similar between ha and na  <cit> . thus, changes in na may be driving incidence patterns as well, resulting in an observed time series of incidence partially divorced from the antigenic map of ha. incorporating antigenic evolution of na could thus yield a rougher antigenic map for ha, more closely matching experimental results, while simultaneously yielding smoother year-to-year incidence patterns.

it remains a central question as to the extent that short-lived strain-transcending immunity is responsible for influenza's limited diversity and spindly genealogical tree  <cit> . our findings suggest a possible resolution. although lacking short-lived immunity, our model shows a detailed correspondence to both the antigenic map and genealogical tree of h3n <dig> influenza. if an antigenic map were to show a deep bifurcation, where two viral lineages move in different antigenic directions, then we would expect the same bifurcation to be evident in the genealogical tree. short-lived strain-transcending immunity provides a mechanism by which lineages may diverge in antigenic phenotype but still show epidemiological interference. this mechanism would explain a situation where bifurcations emerge in the antigenic map, but competition results in the extinction of divergent antigenic lineages. in our model, one cluster leads to another cluster in orderly succession, and there is never competition between antigenically distant clusters. thus, short-lived strain-transcending immunity is not required to limit diversity in the model. this is not to say that short-lived strain-transcending immunity is not present; observed interference between subtypes  <cit> , evolution at ctl epitopes  <cit> , and the exclusion of the beijing/ <dig> cluster by the antigenically distant beijing/ <dig> cluster  <cit>  all suggest some form of more general interaction between influenza viruses.

linear antigenic movement
it might seem reasonable for one viral lineage to move in one antigenic direction, while another lineage moves tangentially, eventually resulting in two non-interacting viral lineages. instead, we find that movement in a single antigenic direction is favored, resulting in most replicate simulations showing low standing diversity . the origins of this pattern can be seen in the interaction between virus evolution and host immunity . as the virus population evolves forward, it leaves a wake of immunity in the host population, and evolution away from this immunity results in the canalization of the antigenic phenotype; mutations that continue along the line of primary antigenic variation will show a transmission advantage compared to more tangential mutations.

following the work of smith et al.  <cit> , it remained an open question of why a two-dimensional map should explain the antigenic variation of h3n <dig> influenza, although the authors astutely speculated that 'there is a selective advantage for clusters that move away linearly from previous clusters as they most effectively escape existing population-level immunity, and this is a plausible explanation for the somewhat linear antigenic evolution in regions of the antigenic map.' this hypothesis remained to be tested. here, we show from a simple model of epidemiology and evolution that a linear trajectory of antigenic evolution dynamically emerges due to basic selective pressures. this result simultaneously explains the linear pattern of antigenic drift  <cit>  and the characteristically spindly genealogical tree  <cit>  exhibited by influenza a .

for this process to take hold, the virus population needs to be somewhat mutationally limited; if functional antigenic variants of novel phenotype emerge too quickly, then antigenic change will occur too rapidly for competition to winnow down the virus population to a single lineage . assuming that antigenic mutations have an average effect of  <dig>  antigenic units and a standard deviation of  <dig>  units, then the rate of new antigenic mutations cannot be greater than approximately 10- <dig> mutations per day . thus, it is important that the rate of 10- <dig> mutations per day be biological plausible. here, we take the rate of synonymous substitution as a proxy for the neutral rate of mutation. the rate of synonymous change has been estimated at  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per day  <cit> . as there are approximately two nonsynonymous sites per codon in influenza  <cit> , this gives a neutral rate of amino acid change of approximately  <dig> × 10- <dig> per site per day. other work has shown that there appear to be approximately  <dig> amino acid sites implicated in the majority of adaptive change  <cit> . these sites evolve along the trunk of the phylogeny at rate of  <dig>  substitutions per site per year or at a combined rate of  <dig>  substitutions per year  <cit> . this result agrees well with our finding of  <dig>  antigenic mutations per year on the phylogeny trunk . if we assume  <dig> sites involved in antigenic change, this gives an overall rate of antigenic mutation of  <dig> × 10- <dig> per day. thus, we believe that 10- <dig> mutations per day represents a biologically reasonable estimate.

to consider to what extent these results were contingent on the dimensionality of the underlying antigenic model, we further implemented our model in a 10-dimensional antigenic space. here, mutations occur as 10-spheres, but the distance moved by a mutation is the same as in the previous two-dimensional formulation. we arrive at nearly the same results with this model; principal components analysis shows that the first and second dimensions of variation account for 87% and 7%, respectively, of the total variance . thus, our model predicts that future work probing mutational effects will support an underlying high-dimensional antigenic space, even though a two-dimensional map is sufficient to explain observed antigenic relationships among evolving strains.

winding back the tape
the 40-year simulation of influenza dynamics shows broad correspondence with observed patterns. however, year-to-year details are not captured, for example, years that undergo antigenic transitions in the 40-year simulation do not match up with observed years of antigenic transitions. over long time spans, year-to-year correspondence seems impossible to achieve in this sort of stochastic system, where evolution is often driven by chance mutations of large antigenic effect. however, correspondence in the shorter term may be possible. to test this, we examined repeatability in replicate simulations, showing what happens when we 'wind back the tape'  <cit>  on the evolution of the virus. we ran  <dig> replicate simulations, each starting from the endpoint of the representative 40-year simulation shown in figure  <dig>  the starting point for these replicate simulations was the exact end state of the 40-year simulation, including the frequencies of every virus strain and the entire host immune profile. these replicate simulations were run for an additional  <dig> years, and all evolutionary and epidemiological parameters were identical to the initial 40-year simulation.

initially, we find a great detail of repeatability; during the first year of evolution, every replicate virus population undergoes a similar antigenic transition , resulting in a repeatable peak in northern hemisphere incidence . after  <dig> years, repeatability has mostly disappeared, with antigenic phenotype and incidence appearing highly variable across replicates . the 1- to 2-year timescale of repeatability can be explained by the presence of standing antigenic variation. in the initial virus population, there are several novel antigenic variants present at low frequency , one of which, without fail, comes to predominate the virus population.

we see that the initial evolutionary trajectory, during which time standing variation plays out, is highly repeatable and thus predictable given enough information and the right methods of analysis. however, prediction of longer-term evolutionary scenarios will necessarily be difficult or impossible except in a vague sense. through careful surveillance e orts and genetic and antigenic characterization of influenza strains, the world health organization makes twice-yearly vaccine strain recommendations  <cit> . it should be possible to combine these sorts of modeling approaches with surveillance data to gauge the likelihood that a sampled variant will spread through the population.

CONCLUSIONS
recent work on empirical fitness landscapes has shown that natural selection follows few mutational paths  <cit> . the spindly genealogical tree and the almost linear serial replacement of influenza strains have remained a puzzling phenomenon. we suggest that the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics displayed by the influenza virus may simply be explained as an outgrowth of selection to avoid host immunity. natural selection can only 'see' one step ahead and so sacrifices long-term gains for short-term advantages. the result is a canalized evolutionary trajectory lacking antigenic diversification.
