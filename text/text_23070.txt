BACKGROUND
the proto-oncogene c-myc is highly expressed in many cancer types  <cit>  and plays a critical role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, loss of differentiation, and apoptosis  <cit> . in transgenic mice, targeted overexpression of myc has been shown to be sufficient to induce cancer  <cit> . in our department, a transgenic mouse model was created which overexpresses c-myc. the c-myc overexpression in alveolar epithelium of these mice results in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma  and papillary adenocarcinoma . life expectancies of c-myc transgenics range between 12– <dig> months.

the molecular mechanisms by which c-myc functions to effect tumorigenesis have been the subject of extensive research in the past several decades. c-myc is a transcription factor, a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein that dimerizes with max to bind the dna sequence 5'-cacgtg-3', known as an e box, and activates transcription  <cit> . myc also represses transcription through interaction with miz- <dig> or through other elements at core promoters  <cit> . furthermore, brenner et al.  <cit>  suggested that c-myc may also repress transcription by recruitment of a dna methyl-transferase corepressor dnmt3a. dna methylation is the most important epigenetic modification in mammalian cells and is associated with transcriptional repression. nevertheless, the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by c-myc seem not to occur by direct binding of c-myc to the dna sequence 5'-cacgtg-3', known as an e box, and are not really well understood.

the pleiotropic effects of c-myc on tumorigenesis are thought to be mediated by its target genes, because transcriptionally defective myc alleles have diminished transforming potential  <cit> . furthermore, the domain that is required for c-myc dna binding, the basic helix-loop-helix zipper domain, is essential for its oncogenic transformation, and c-myc possesses an n-terminal transactivation domain. deletions or mutations in this domain result in loss of c-myc transformation  <cit> . the transcriptional activation potential of c-myc, however, does not always correlate with its ability to transform rodent fibroblast cells  <cit> . several studies showed that mutations in the myc box ii domain within c-myc can abrogate its transformation capacity without affecting c-myc activation of reporter gene constructs  <cit> . these results emphasized the complex and interrelated nature of c-myc-mediated transformation and highlighted the need to identify specific factors that interact with functionally important domains of the c-myc oncoproteins.

despite extensive research, the specific mechanisms by which tumorigenesis are achieved are not well understood. this is largely because a comprehensive list of biologically relevant myc target genes has not yet been defined and such "transformation" associated genes remain elusive  <cit> . in order to elucidate myc targets many different techniques have been employed, such as microarray profiling, serial analysis of gene expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation  <cit> . to date, >  <dig>  genes have been found to be myc-responsive and stored in the myc target gene database  <cit> , but only a minority of the myc-responsive genes have been implicated as direct target genes. c-myc seems to induce a regulatory gene network, which consists of direct and indirect responses. the direct responses also seem to depend on different other transcription factors which either cooperate with or compete against c-myc. some of these transcription factors have already been described in the literature  <cit> .

in this study, we report a genetic and bioinformatic approach designed to identify regulatory gene networks induced by overexpression of c-myc in alveolar epithelium of our female transgenic mouse model, resulting in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma  and papillary adenocarcinoma . because the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by c-myc do not occur by direct binding of c-myc to e boxes, we restricted our analysis to promoter sequences of induced genes in which the potential c-myc binding sites can be identified in silico. thus, we have identified potential direct target genes of c-myc and propose different transcription factors which either cooperate with or compete against c-myc. furthermore, we in silico describe different indirect mechanisms possibly participating in the myc tumorigenic phenotype. taken together, we suggest a model of a regulatory gene network in which different tfs act in concert upon overexpression of c-myc in our transgenic mouse model.

RESULTS
analysis of high-density oligonucleotide microarray data
global gene expression studies were done with lung tissue stemming from a female mouse transgenic line overexpressing the c-myc proto-oncogene. the complete data have been deposited in ncbis gene expression omnibus   <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  the quantitative changes in significantly altered genes were investigated. for the definition of "significantly altered", see the methods section. according to these criteria, transcription of  <dig> genes was induced and transcription of  <dig> genes was repressed in  <dig> months old animals . at this time point the tumor burden was approximately 50%. it must be mentioned here that gene expression profiling by microarrays does not provide information about rates of transcription but measure mrna abundance which might have been modified by processes such as reduced rna degradation.

validation of microarray data by real time pcr
for the validation of microarray data, five different genes were selected: met , myct <dig> , myc , pnliprp <dig>  and pbk . expression of these genes was alternatively investigated with real time quantitative pcr using the lightcycler®. comparison of fold changes determined by microarray analysis and real time pcr are shown in figure  <dig>  statistical significant changes in microarray analysis are indicated by a black diamond. criteria for significance are described in the methods section. statistical significant changes in real time pcr are marked with an asterisk, which is based on a paired two-tailed student t-test. the results were considered significant when the p-value was less than  <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig> there was basic agreement between the two platforms. the fold changes of met, however, differ strongly between microarray analysis and real time pcr. this phenomenon can be observed sometimes with the validation of microarray data by real time pcr: microarray analysis shows strong up regulation whereas pcr indicates a very low fold change like  <dig>  or less. here, the reason might be the low average intensity value of  <dig>  combined with its high standard deviation of  <dig> % for met in the microarray experiments of non-transgenic animals. notably, the average standard deviation of all significantly regulated genes of this study amounts  <dig> %. together with a high and stable average intensity value of  <dig> combined with its low standard deviation of  <dig> % for met in the microarray experiments of c-myc-transgenic animals the corresponding fold change appears higher than it might be in fact. furthermore, we did not compare gene expression on identical sequences. hence, we can not exclude the possibility that transcript expression differs on the basis of the different sequences  employed.

promoter sequence analysis of genes induced by overexpression of c-myc
a flowchart of our in silico strategy used to elucidate the c-myc regulatory network is depicted in figure  <dig> 

1) analysis of promoters of  <dig> induced genes with respect to c-myc binding sites
by using their refseq annotation,  <dig> promoter sequences could be extracted from the ucsc genome browser for the  <dig> upregulated genes. furthermore, promoters of  <dig> genes which were not regulated at all were extracted . both sequence sets were analyzed using transfac® professional rel.  <dig>  integrated tool match® by using the matrices v$ebox_q6_ <dig> , v$myc_q <dig> , and v$mycmax_b . the results of these analyses including positions and sequences of the corresponding binding sites are given in additional file  <dig>  altogether,  <dig> different c-myc binding sites were found in  <dig> different promoters, which partly were recognized by different matrices. table  <dig> gives the  <dig> genes which are putatively directly regulated by c-myc and the corresponding biological process they are involved in. in this table, the  <dig> targets stored already in the myc target database are marked bold. moreover, the number of c-myc binding sites identified in the promoter set including promoters of induced genes was compared to the number of c-myc binding sites identified in the control promoter set. the corresponding calculated fold occurrences of binding sites and the significance  of the occurrence values are given in table  <dig>  the fold occurrences describe the number of c-myc binding sites detected as a ratio with regard to the number of gene promoters analyzed. here, the fold occurrence of the non-regulated gene promoters is set to  <dig>  for all matrices used the fold occurrences of the c-myc binding sites of the analyzed promoters in total are increased in comparison to the fold occurrences of the c-myc binding sites of the control gene promoters in total. furthermore, the significance of the occurrence values is high. this result indicates direct regulation by c-myc of many of the genes analyzed.

the table gives the  <dig> genes which are putatively directly regulated by c-myc and the corresponding biological processes they are involved in. in this table, the  <dig> targets stored already in the myc target database are marked bold.

the occurrence value of c-myc binding sites in the promoters of control genes is set to  <dig>  significance of the representation value of c-myc binding sites in the promoters of induced genes is measured by the p-value derived from the binomial distribution.

2) analysis of flanking sequences  around the  <dig> c-myc binding sites
for this analysis, we extracted the  <dig> c-myc binding sites including the flanking sequences ). we further randomly extracted the same number of  <dig> bp sequences from the control promoters which were not regulated at all . both sequence sets were analyzed using transfac® professional rel.  <dig>  integrated tool match® by using the matrix profile "vertebrates_minsum_highqual". an extract of the results of these analyses including the numbers of transcription factor binding sites in the corresponding promoter sets, the following fold occurrence of a given tf, and the significance  of the occurrence values are listed in table  <dig>  the complete result of this analysis is given in additional file  <dig>  according to table  <dig>  the putative c-myc binding sites in the  <dig> analyzed sequences have been identified by six different matrices included in the profile used . the  <dig> different putative c-myc binding sites were recognized partly by different matrices. as expected the significance of the occurrence values for each c-myc matrice is high, respectively. furthermore, the number of hits of different matrices for the transcription factors e2f, ap <dig>  zf <dig>  and zic <dig> clearly shows a highly significant overrepresentation in comparison to control sequences which contain nearly no c-myc binding sites.

the transfac identifier of the respective matrix, the number of hits in the  <dig> different sequences  of induced gene promoters, the number of hits in the  <dig> different sequences  of control  gene promoters, and the corresponding fold occurrences are given in this table. the occurrence value of the respective binding site in the promoters of control genes is set to  <dig>  significance of the representation value of binding sites in flanking sequences  around the  <dig> c-myc binding sites in the promoters of induced genes is measured by the p-value derived from the binomial distribution.

this might mean that these tfs bind in the nearest neighborhood to c-myc in order to either cooperate with or compete against c-myc. the distribution of these tfs around the c-myc binding sites is shown in figure  <dig>  here, the diagrams show that ap <dig> and zic <dig> do not or nearly not bind to the same site as c-myc does, whereas e2f and zf <dig> in some cases seem to bind to the same site as c-myc.

3) analysis of promoters of  <dig> induced genes with respect to binding sites of tfs which were transcriptionally induced by overexpression of c-myc
according to geneontology  <dig> of  <dig> deregulated genes possess transcription factor activity or transcription regulator activity . in the database transfac® professional rel.  <dig> , however, positional weight matrices are available only for the  <dig> transcription factors atf <dig>  foxf1a, smad <dig>  sox <dig>  sp <dig>  and stat5a, which were upregulated by overexpression of c-myc.

next, we analyzed the  <dig> promoter sequences out of  <dig> upregulated genes which are available in the ucsc genome browser, using the transfac® professional rel.  <dig>  integrated tool match® by applying the matrices v$crebatf_q <dig> , v$hfh8_ <dig> , v$smad- <dig> , v$sox_q <dig> , v$stat5a_ <dig> , v$stat5a_ <dig> , v$stat5a_ <dig> , v$stat5a_ <dig> , and v$sp3_q <dig> . the results of this analysis including positions and sequences of the corresponding binding sites are given in additional file  <dig>  altogether,  <dig> putative binding sites were found in  <dig> different promoters.  <dig> binding sites for atf <dig>  in  <dig> different promoters were identified,  <dig> binding sites for foxf1a  in  <dig> different promoters,  <dig> binding sites for smad <dig>  in  <dig> different promoters,  <dig> binding sites for sox <dig>  in  <dig> different promoters,  <dig> binding sites for stat5a  in  <dig> different promoters, and  <dig> binding sites for sp <dig>  in  <dig> different promoters. they are listed in additional file  <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig> promoters possessing a binding site of a transcription factor whose transcription was induced by c-myc possess also a c-myc binding site .

4) analysis of promoters of induced genes – without any c-myc binding sites and without any binding sites of tfs which were induced by c-myc – with respect to binding sites of other tfs
the  <dig> promoters of genes induced by overexpression of c-myc which possess neither a putative c-myc binding site nor a binding site of a transcription factor which was transcriptionally induced by c-myc were analyzed using transfac® professional rel.  <dig>  integrated tool match® by applying the matrix profile "vertebrates_minsum_highqual". we further performed the same analysis using control promoters which were not regulated at all . an extract of the results of these analyses including the numbers of transcription factor binding sites in the corresponding promoter sets and the resulting fold occurrence of a given tf are listed in table  <dig>  according to this table, the different matrices for the transcription factors oct <dig>  mzf <dig>  pparg, plzf, ets, and hmgiy provide more than  <dig> hits. this table clearly shows an overrepresentation in comparison to control sequences. we found  <dig> putative oct <dig> binding sites in  <dig> promoters,  <dig> putative mzf <dig> binding sites in  <dig> promoters,  <dig> putative pparg binding sites in  <dig> promoters,  <dig> putative plzf binding sites in  <dig> promoters,  <dig> putative ets binding sites in  <dig> promoters, and  <dig> putative hmgiy binding sites in  <dig> promoters. they are listed in additional file  <dig>  a summary of all results is depicted in figure  <dig> 

the transfac identifier of the respective matrix, the number of hits in the  <dig> induced gene promoters, the number of hits in the  <dig> non-regulated control gene promoters, and the corresponding fold occurrences are given in this table. the occurrence value of the respective binding site in the promoters of control genes is set to  <dig>  significance of the representation value of tf binding sites in the promoters is measured by the p-value derived from the binomial distribution.

discussion
transcription profiling studies have identified many target genes activated or repressed by c-myc in various animal and human cells or cell lines. the number of experimentally validated c-myc targets is rapidly expanding thanks to the use of high-throughput methods  <cit> . two recent studies suggest that the potential list of c-myc targets could be much larger than what was previously anticipated  <cit> . moreover, chen et al.  <cit>  suggest the existence of a significant tissue-specific component in the response of many c-myc target genes. gene expression studies alone, however, cannot discriminate between direct and indirect targets of c-myc action, although network-based interference of direct action has been proposed  <cit> . furthermore, gene expression studies alone can identify neither transcription factor activations or repressions on the protein level nor transcriptional cooperation and competition of different transcription factors involved in the corresponding regulatory network. analysis of promoters of regulated genes resulting from gene expression studies, however, may provide indications in these directions.

thus, using positional weight matrices , which is the most widely used method for recognition of transcription factor binding sites  <cit> , we analyzed promoters of genes which were induced by overexpression of c-myc in alveolar epithelium of our female transgenic mouse model resulting in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma  and papillary adenocarcinoma , in order to elucidate the c-myc transcriptional regulatory network consisting of direct and indirect mechanisms possibly participating in the myc tumorigenic phenotype. we wish to point out that the c-myc transcriptional regulatory network analyzed in other tissues might be different from the network described in this study. indeed, an analysis of  <dig> genes whose promoters  possess at least one experimentally determined high-quality myc binding locus on human p <dig> b cells  <cit>  provided no overlap with promoters of genes in mouse lung adenocarcinoma reported in the present study.

by applying three different weight matrices for recognition of c-myc binding sites, we predicted  <dig> putative c-myc targets among the genes presented on affymetrix platform genechip® mouse genome  <dig>  <dig> . this list contains  <dig> targets stored in the myc target database, whereas  <dig> genes are putative novel targets. whether they are real targets remains to be elucidated. the functional categories of these  <dig> putative c-myc targets revealed that various cellular processes like transcriptional regulation, protein modification and transport, cell cycle control/proliferation, metabolism, and signal transduction are putatively directly regulated by c-myc. these findings correlate well with expectations based on the biology of c-myc.

in higher organisms transcription factors usually operate in combination with other transcription factors bound in direct neighborhood in promoter sequences to influence gene transcription. up to now, less is known about transcription factors  collaborating with c-myc. previously, elkon et al.  <cit>  reported in silico identified transcriptional regulators associated with c-myc activity in human burkitt's lymphoma cells and this included overrepresentation of binding sites of the transcription factors etf, sp <dig>  nrf- <dig>  nf-y, creb, egr- <dig>  elk- <dig>  e2f and ahr/arnt in c-myc target genes. the extracted and analyzed promoters spanned  <dig> bp upstream to  <dig> bp downstream of the transcription start sites of the corresponding genes.

in the present study, we analyzed exclusively the flanking sequences around the in silico identified c-myc binding sites by use of all available positional weight matrices in the transfac database. especially binding sites of the transcription factors e2f, ap <dig>  zf <dig>  and zic <dig> were found to be significantly enriched from  <dig> - to 10-fold over control promoter background. the poor concordance of our results and those of elkon et al.  <cit>  might be due to different reasons: we analyzed different species, different tissues, and different lengths of analyzed sequences and therefore, possibly different distances from c-myc binding sites.

notably, both studies identified e2f to be a transcriptional regulator associated with c-myc. like c-myc, e2f also controls cell cycle progression and dna replication  <cit> . thus, deregulation of c-myc could potentially lead to uncontrolled cell cycle progression through a functional link with e2f, as proposed also by zeller et al.  <cit> . the authors supposed that high c-myc expression leads to increased e2f activity by upregulating genes involved in cell cycle control. the cooperative binding of myc and e2f followed by transcriptional activation of key downstream targets leads to an increase in dna replication and cell cycle progression . here, by using four different matrices for e2f, we found e2f binding sites in the direct neighborhood of c-myc binding sites  in  <dig> sequences out of  <dig> sequences possessing a c-myc binding site. depending on the matrix used, they are  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold enriched over the control promoter background. furthermore, the network relationships between c-myc and e2f are also obvious through the identification of functional e2f binding sites in the c-myc  <cit>  and in the e2f promoter  <cit>  as well as the identification of e2f as a c-myc target gene  <cit> .

by using four different matrices for ap <dig>  we also found ap <dig> binding sites in the direct neighborhood of c-myc binding sites in  <dig> sequences out of  <dig> sequences possessing a c-myc binding site. depending on the matrix applied, they are  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold enriched over the control promoter background. in  <dig>  zeller et al. already identified ap <dig> to be significantly enriched in cis-regulatory modules with c-myc  <cit> . the ap <dig> family of transcription factors plays a broad range of roles in cell growth, tissue morphogenesis, and cancers. one of the mechanisms by which the ap <dig> family fulfills their roles is to activate or suppress various downstream target genes at transcriptional levels. a number of studies demonstrated that ap2-interacting proteins can affect the transcription of ap <dig> downstream targets by modulating the transcriptional activity of ap <dig>  in fact, several ap2-interacting partners have been identified, such as yy <dig>  rb, and c-myc  <cit> . thus, ap <dig> is a known c-myc partner. in  <dig>  gaubatz et al.  <cit>  showed that ap <dig> acts as an inhibitor of myc-mediated transactivation, a function that is mediated both by competition of ap <dig> with binding of myc or max and by direct protein-protein interaction of ap <dig> with the br/hlh/lz domain of the myc protein. here, in the promoters of which both binding sites – c-myc and ap <dig> – were found in the direct neighborhood, the overrepresented transcription factor c-myc might have induced the corresponding gene transcription, whereas under normal conditions ap <dig> might be able to inhibit this transactivation .

we also found zf <dig> binding sites in the direct neighborhood of c-myc binding sites in  <dig> sequences out of  <dig> sequences possessing a c-myc binding site. they are  <dig> -fold enriched over the control promoter background. zf <dig> is a ubiquitously expressed protein originally identified by its ability to bind and repress the murine c-myc promoter  <cit> . it contains an n-terminal poz domain, which is a conserved protein-protein interface that recruits cofactors to modulate transcription  <cit> . zf <dig> mediates both transcriptional activation and repression of cellular and viral promoters  <cit> . here, in the promoters of which both binding sites – c-myc and zf <dig> – were found in the direct neighborhood, the overrepresented transcription factor c-myc might have induced the corresponding gene transcription, whereas under normal conditions zf <dig> might be able to competitively inhibit this transactivation and further inhibit the transcription of the c-myc gene .

furthermore, we found zic <dig> binding sites in the direct neighborhood of c-myc binding sites in  <dig> sequences out of  <dig> sequences possessing a c-myc binding site. they are  <dig> -fold enriched over the control promoter background. zic <dig> is a developmental specific zinc finger transcription factor defining early embryo patterning  <cit> . although zic <dig> expression has been implicated in embryonic development, however, a detailed understanding is still missing of what regulates zic <dig> expression and what the downstream effectors of zic <dig> are. until now, there is no indication of connectivity of zic <dig> and c-myc, with one exception: in  <dig>  zeller et al. found that the zic <dig> binding motifs are significantly enriched in c-myc-repressed genes after a genome-wide characterization of direct c-myc binding targets in a model of human b lymphoid tumor using chip coupled with pair-end ditag sequencing analysis . here, however, we found zic <dig> binding motifs to be significantly enriched in c-myc-induced genes after overexpression of c-myc in alveolar epithelium of our female transgenic mouse model . to elucidate the biological significance of this observation further studies are necessary.

as mentioned above, gene expression studies alone cannot discriminate between direct and indirect targets of c-myc action. nevertheless, with overexpression of c-myc in alveolar epithelium of our female transgenic mouse model resulting in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma  and papillary adenocarcinoma   <dig> of  <dig> deregulated genes possess transcription factor activity or transcription regulator activity. these transcription factors mediate the indirect actions of c-myc. by using the corresponding available positional weight matrices from transfac  for the analysis of the  <dig> deregulated genes, many putative indirect targets of c-myc action could be identified. in  <dig> promoters at least one binding site for atf <dig> has been identified. atf <dig> belongs to the basic region leucine zipper  family of transcription factors and is an important member of activating protein  <dig>   <cit> . atf <dig> functions either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other members of the atf family as well as other bzip proteins, to bind to specific dna sequences and activate gene expression. one major role of atf <dig> is to regulate the response of cells to stress signals  <cit> . furthermore, in  <dig>  miethe j et al.  <cit>  identified a crosstalk between myc and activating transcription factor  <dig> : myc prolongs the half-life of atf <dig> and causes increased phosphorylation of atf <dig> at sites that have been shown to be crucial for the regulation of atf <dig> activity  <cit> . thus, atf <dig> is activated by c-myc on the protein level. here, we show a novel mechanism for gene activation by c-myc: the transcriptional activation of the transcription factor atf <dig>  which in turn putatively activates the transcription of  <dig> genes . additionally, tamura et al. also demonstrated an interaction between atf <dig> and c-myc in rat fibroblasts by affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation  <cit> .

the members of the forkhead box  family of transcription factors play important roles in regulating transcription of genes involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic homeostasis  <cit> . foxf <dig> rna is expressed at mesenchymal-epithelial interfaces involved in lung and gut morphogenesis  <cit> . in the adult mouse, foxf <dig> rna is detected in smooth muscle layers of pulmonary bronchioles, lamina propria of the stomach and the intestine, and in alveolar endothelial cells. foxf <dig> is further essential for normal lung repair and endothelial cell survival in response to pulmonary cell injury  <cit> . here, we demonstrated transcriptional activation of the foxf <dig> gene by overexpression of c-myc and thus an indirect c-myc action . foxf <dig> putatively activates the transcription of  <dig> genes.

negative regulation of c-myc expression by tgf-β is well established and is a key mechanism through which tgf-β causes g <dig> arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation in epithelial cells. three studies identified the tie sequence in the c-myc promoter as mediating the tgf-β effect on c-myc expression. a complex of smad3-smad <dig>  e2f4/ <dig>  dp <dig>  and p <dig> binds to the tie in response to tgf-β to inhibit transcription of c-myc  <cit> . this smad-dependent repression of c-myc expression was previously the only known function of smad <dig> in the regulation of c- myc. data presented by lim sk and hoffmann fm  <cit>  provide evidence that smad <dig> can also function as a positive regulator of c- myc expression in the absence of tgf-β signaling. here, in turn, we identified the ability of c-myc to act as a positive regulator of smad <dig> expression . smad <dig> again mediates the indirect effects of c-myc .

the sox <dig> gene is highly expressed in human breast cancer cell lines, colon cancer cell lines, hepatocarcinoma, medulloblastomas, and adenoid cystic carcinomas  <cit> . sox- <dig> was also shown to be highly and differentially expressed in a substantial fraction of small-cell lung carcinoma  samples and in a pool of primary lung adenocarcinoma samples, with very low levels of expression in a number of normal essential tissues. notably, evidence has been presented to suggest that sox- <dig> may be involved in tumorigenesis  <cit> . here, we identified the ability of c-myc to act as an indirect positive regulator of sox- <dig> expression. sox- <dig> again mediates the indirect effects of c-myc .

sp <dig> is a ubiquitous transcription factor closely related to sp <dig> and contains activation and inhibitory domains. it can act as an activator or repressor of transcription  <cit> . in  <dig>  the results of abdelrahim m et al. showed that sp <dig> plays an important role in cell cycle progression of pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> . stat5a is a transcription factor that mediates cytokine and hormone signals. its constitutive activation has been observed in several human cancers, and it is oncogenic in cell culture models and transgenic animals  <cit> . here, we identified the ability of c-myc to act as an indirect positive regulator of sp <dig> and stat5a expression. sp <dig> and stat5a again mediate the indirect effects of c-myc .

general analysis of the promoters which do not contain any putative c-myc binding site nor any putative binding site of transcription factors  being transcriptionally induced by overexpression of c-myc resulted in the observation that some tf binding sites are overrepresented against the control promoter background. these are binding sites of the tfs: oct <dig>  mzf <dig>  pparg, plzf, ets, and hmgiy .

some of them are worth mentioning, because they seem in part to mediate the carcinogenic effect seen in mice after overexpression of the c-myc oncogene: oct <dig> modulates the activity of genes important for the cellular response to stress  <cit> . although adipose tissue has been recognized as a principal site of ppar gamma expression, it is now known that ppar gamma is expressed in many other types of tissues and cells. it has often been mentioned in the context of cancer: its ligand activation has been shown to be involved in promotion or regression of colon tumors  <cit> . furthermore, activation of ppar gamma agonists capable of modestly inducing apoptosis has also been documented in a variety of tumor types  <cit> . notably, yamakawa-karakida n et al.  provided the first evidence of the linkage between ppar gamma-mediated apoptosis and downregulation of c-myc gene expression  <cit> .

plzf is known to be a transcriptional repressor which is associated with suppression of cellular proliferation. mcconnell mj et al.  showed that plzf expression maintains a cell in a quiescent state by repressing c-myc expression and preventing cell cycle progression  <cit> . they suggested that loss of this suppression would have serious consequences for cell growth control and that growth suppression mediated by plzf can be reversed by enforced expression of c-myc. here, through the overexpression of c-myc, we found  <dig> putative target genes for plzf. they are, however, transcriptionally induced, which might be the reversed effect mentioned by mcconnell mj et al.  <cit> . under normal conditions, these genes would be transcriptionally repressed by plzf. loss of this repression might play a role in the development of the tumorigenic phenotype of c-myc.

hmgiy has been shown to be a direct c-myc target gene  <cit> . some studies indicate an important role for hmgiy proteins in regulating gene expression  <cit> . histon h1-mediated repression of transcription is reduced by hmgiy  <cit> . like c-myc, expression of hmgiy also correlates with rapidly proliferating mammalian tissues as well as neoplastic transformation  <cit>  and, moreover, a higher residence time in heterochromatin and chromosomes, compared with euchromatic regions, correlates with an increased phosphorylation level of hmgiy  <cit> .

the human ets gene family includes  <dig> genes that code for transcription factors involved in the control of various aspects of cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. ets domain transcription factors have been implicated in development of various forms of leukemias and solid tumors. it has been well established that their function can be controlled by phosphorylation-mediated effects on dna binding. phosphorylation has been shown to positively regulate transcriptional activities of ets <dig> and ets <dig>   <cit> .

binding sites of the transcription factors oct <dig>  mzf <dig>  pparg, plzf, ets, and hmgiy were found to be overrepresented in promoters of genes induced by overexpression of c-myc. their own gene expression, however, was unchanged. one explanation for this observation might be their regulation on the protein level. nevertheless, some of these transcription factors seem to participate also in the myc tumorigenic phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
taken collectively, after transcription profiling of lung adenocarcinomas of female c-myc-transgenic mice we were able to describe the c-myc regulatory gene network in silico. by using positional weight matrices , which is the most widely used method for recognition of transcription factor binding sites, we identified different mechanisms by which c-myc putatively mediates its tumorigenic actions :

1) putative direct actions in part in cooperation or competition with other transcription factors .

2) putative indirect c-myc actions, mediated by transcription factors transcriptionally induced by overexpression of c-myc .

3) putative indirect c-myc actions, mediated by transcription factors regulated by overexpression of c-myc on the protein level or mediated by as yet unknown mechanisms .

thus, our in silico description of the c-myc regulatory gene network has yielded already known and also many novel putative direct and indirect targets of c-myc. it provides some insights into how tumorigenesis is caused by deregulated c-myc, a prevalent finding in human cancers.
