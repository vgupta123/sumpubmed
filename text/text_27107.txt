BACKGROUND
brucellosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by the infection of brucella species, a gram-negative and facultative intracellular bacterium. brucellosis can be acquired by direct contact with infected animals including cattle, sheep, goats and swine. brucella infects approximately  <dig>  humans worldwide annually according to the world health organization   <cit> . the infection can cause reproductive failure in food animals and even the loss of human productivity. the clinical symptoms of brucella infection include undulant fever, abortion, asthenia, endocarditis, and encephalitis. brucellosis in food animals could be controlled by vaccination, while human brucellosis can be treated with antibiotics.

currently, there are ten recognized brucella species based on their host preference and phenotypic differences: b. melitensis , b. abortus , b. suis , b. canis , b. ovis , b. neotomae , b. ceti , b. pinnipedialis , b. microti  and b. inopinata   <cit> . the genome of b. melitensis strain 16m is the first one to be sequenced  <cit> , followed by b. suis strain  <dig>  <cit>  and b. abortus strain  <dig> and 9– <dig>  <cit> . new brucella genome sequences are increasing, and at least  <dig> brucella strains have been sequenced. these genomic resources can be served for identifying brucella gene variability that associated with their host preference, pathogenesis, and virulence.

b. suis strain  <dig>  is a swine isolate and used as the standard reference strain for b. suis biovar  <dig>  <cit> . according to phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> brucella strains, b. suis has a broader host specificity without any identified species-specific markers  <cit> .

the b. suis strain s <dig> is isolated from swine fetus by the institute of inspection for veterinary medicine in  <dig> in china. it possesses all of the characteristics of b. suis biovar  <dig> and a smooth colonial morphology  <cit> . after serial transfer on media for years, b. suis strain s <dig> is naturally attenuated to a vaccine strain designated as b. suis vaccine “strain 2” or s <dig> . the avirulent property of s <dig> is stable when inoculated into susceptible animals, and it does not cause the abortion of pregnant female  <cit> . therefore, it has been widely used in china since  <dig> to vaccinate sheep and goats  <cit> . the vaccine is administered through drinking water, a dose of  <dig> billion bacteria provides the protection for 2– <dig> years. in the middle of 1980s, s <dig> is introduced to the other countries  <cit> . although studies suggest that the protection rate of s <dig> is less than that of b. abortus “strain 19” or s <dig>  and b. melitensis rev.  <dig>   <cit> , a large-scale animal test shows that s <dig> can provide a satisfactory protection rate in the field  <cit> . based on these encouraging results, the low virulence compared with s <dig> and rev. <dig>  the low cost of production, the safety for pregnant sheep and the feasibility of administration by the oral route in cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, s <dig> is used successfully in china to vaccinate all target species against brucellosis by administration through drinking water . in mice, s <dig> has low residual virulence and less persistence time compared with s <dig> and rev. <dig>  it provides short-time protection against virulence b. melitensis challenge compared with the other two vaccines  <cit> . however, it does not show significant protection against b. melitensis 53h <dig> challenge when tested in lambs  <cit> .

the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms of the low virulence of s <dig> are not well understood so far. in this study, we performed the paired-end sequencing combined with sanger sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of s <dig>  we further identified the different genes between s <dig> and  <dig> by genome comparison. several putative factors were identified as the candidate genes that might be related to the virulence attenuation of s <dig>  further investigation of these target genes will be important for designing better vaccines to provide efficient control for brucellosis.

RESULTS
genome sequence properties
the s <dig> genome was comprised of two circular chromosomes . one chromosome was  <dig> ,842 bp and the other was  <dig> ,433 bp long in length. the average gc content of the two chromosomes was 57 %. unsurprisingly, the s <dig> genomes exhibited significant similarities in size and structure compared to the genomic sequences of  <dig>  the s <dig> genome sequences showed over  <dig>  % similarities with the genomes of  <dig>  the diagram of s <dig> genomes is shown in fig.  <dig>  circos was employed to construct the diagram  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> open reading frames  were identified on chromosome i and ii, respectively. sequences of these two chromosomes can be accessed from genbank . more than  <dig>  % of orfs in s <dig> were identical to those found in  <dig> . s <dig> exhibited highly genome-wide collinearity with  <dig> . more than 38 % of the predicted orfs in s <dig> had rpsblast hits to the cluster of orthologous groups  database with an e-value less than 1e- <dig>  a total of  <dig> orfs  were hypothetical proteins .table  <dig> genome properties of the newly sequenced genome of b. suis strain s <dig> in comparison with the known genome sequence of b. suis strain 1330

identification of virulence associated differences between the attenuated strain s <dig> and virulent strain 1330
the pairwise comparison was carried out to identify the non-identical orfs between s <dig> and  <dig> , which provided useful information on the underlying mechanisms for the attenuation of s <dig> 

most of the different orfs between  <dig> and s <dig> in chromosome i and ii had only 1 bp difference in nucleotide sequence. six orfs had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 78 bp insertion or deletion in the genes respectively . the insertion or deletion in the gene caused either frameshifting  or residue insertion in the coding protein. the different orfs in s <dig> that encoded the same protein sequences in other brucella strains were labeled ‘found’ and omitted in discussions. the different orfs labeled with ‘surface’ suggested that the different residue was located on the surface of the modeled structure, which were also omitted from the analysis .

known virulence associated differences
in chromosome i of s <dig>  a 2 bp deletion caused the premature stop of an outer membrane autotransporter omaa. the autotransporters are secreted proteins that can translocate themselves through the membranes to the cell surface or to the extracellular environment. bandara et al. studied the function of this omaa  <cit> . in mice, the omaa-deficient strain provides greater protection against the challenge of  <dig> than that of b. suis mutant strain vtrs <dig>  the deficient strain can induce a significantly higher level of serum igg <dig> and igg2a antibodies and can be cleared quickly from the mice. although the omaa activity is not necessary in the course of the acute phase of infection of b. suis, it might still be a critical virulent factor during the chronic phase of the infection. therefore, we suspected the lack of intact omaa protein might be the major cause for s <dig> virulence attenuation.

the second difference between  <dig> and s <dig> was found in the erythritol  operon. the erythritol operon contains  <dig> orfs   <cit> . erythritol metabolism by brucella has been known to be associated with the abortion in livestock. the high concentration of erythritol in the foetal tissue of the animal  might be advantageous for the growth of brucella. on the other hand, erythritol catabolism pathway might play the important physiological roles in bacteria growth. it has been suggested that erythrose 4-phosphate, the precursor for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, may be easily obtained from the intermediates of erythritol catabolism. compared to  <dig>  a 16 bp insertion caused the premature stop of the eryd gene in s <dig>  the studies on b. abortus s <dig> and s <dig> showed that eryd might act as a repressor of erythritol operon  <cit> . the consequence of eryc and eryd orfs deletion in s <dig> has been studied, which reveals that they are not sufficient or required for virulence in a murine model. no direct correlation between erythritol metabolism and in vivo colonization was found when s <dig> and  <dig> strains were compared with three genetically engineered strains related to ery operon  <cit> . considering its repressive control on ery operon, the lack of eryd might cause the uncontrolled erythritol catabolism. nevertheless, its consequence on virulence attenuation needs to be further explored.

it has been reported that s <dig> does not grow on tsa . to test the growth capacity of s <dig> on erythritol, we chose s <dig> as the control. we found that s <dig> was able to grow on erythritol agar, suggesting it has the ability to metabolize erythritol . we compared the genomes of  <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> around the ery operon. s <dig> and  <dig> genomes have the same erya, eryb and eryc genes, while eryd in s <dig> genome encodes a premature protein. meanwhile, a 68 bp deletion in the region of eryc and eryd results in an orf encoding a putative sugar binding protein in s <dig>  the other genes upstream and downstream of ery operon in these three genomes are highly conserved, except for some mutations in the encoded proteins . based on the analysis, the inviability of s <dig> on erythritol agar might be due to the lack of eryc and eryd genes in the genome. a recent paper describes a new pathway on erythritol metabolism. except for the known erya, eryb, eryc and eryd genes, two critical genes downstream of the eryd gene, tpia <dig> and rpib, in erythritol metabolism are demonstrated. the new model strongly suggests that erythritol metabolism needs three isomerization reactions sequentially catalyzed by eryc, tpia <dig>  and rpib to produce d-erythrose-4-p, which will be converted into glyceraldehyde-3-p and fructose-6-p in the pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> . this new model clarifies why s <dig> could not grow on erythritol agar since functional eryc is lost in the genome.table  <dig> effect of erythritol on growth of brucella suis strain s <dig> and b. abortus strain s19

phosphatidylcholine synthase gene  in chromosome  <dig> of s <dig> strain had one different residue  compared with pcs protein in  <dig>  in bacteria, phosphatidylcholine can be synthesized through either the phospholipid n-methylation pathway or the phosphatidylcholine synthase pathway  <cit> . the correlation between bacterial virulence and membrane phosphatidylcholine has been reported in l. pneumophila and a. tumefaciens . the cell envelope of the brucella contains phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. although the phosphatidylcholine level in bacterial membrane does not affect some major virulence properties of brucella such as invasion, intracellular traffic, and intracellular replication, it is necessary to maintain a chronic infection in mice  <cit> . a systematic study on phosphatidylcholine synthase from s. meliloti was performed by alanine scanning mutagenesis. protein sequence alignment of pcss from several bacteria species showed that only five of eight residues at position  <dig> are serine. changing the conserved residues close to position  <dig> causes about 20 % decrease in pcs activity  <cit> . further studies are needed to explore if the mutation at position  <dig> affects the pcs activity, which might decrease s <dig> virulence.

peptidoglycan is a major component of the bacterial cell wall. its main function is to preserve the cell integrity and resist osmotic pressure  <cit> . it has been shown that peptidoglycan synthesis genes affect bacterial shape, elongation, and cell division  <cit> . therefore, disruption of peptidoglycan synthesis might affect the survival rate of the bacteria in the host. udp-n-acetylglucosamine  is one of the key building blocks in peptidoglycan biosynthesis  <cit> . the second step in the formation of udp-glcnac is the interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphorglucosamine mutase . a growing body of research suggests the importance of pngm in bacterial virulence and infectivity . the different residue in pngm between s <dig> and  <dig> was located at position  <dig>  although the residue was close to the substrate binding site, it did not interact with the substrate. the biochemical studies are needed to fully define the function of this residue on pngm activity and bacterial virulence.

pyruvate kinase , the key enzyme in the glycolysis, is important for controlling the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, biosynthetic precursors and nucleoside triphosphates in the cells. pyruvate kinase transfers the phosphoryl group of phosphoenolpyruvate to adp to yield pyruvate and atp. most eukaryotic pks can be allosterically activated by fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate , while bacterial pk could be activated by either fbp or amp/sugar monophosphates  <cit> . the bacteria carrying the impaired pk activity might exhibit severe attenuation as suggested in the study in c. neoformans  <cit> . in chromosome i of s <dig>  there was one residue different  in pk compared to that in  <dig>  based on result of the protein databank search by blastp program, brucella pk shared some similarities with pks from other species, such as human, rabbit, b. stearothermophilus, s. aureus et al. in the structure of human pyruvate kinase isozyme m <dig>  the corresponding threonine at position  <dig> was close to the fbp binding site and interacted with fbp through two water molecules  <cit> . the threonine residue is highly conserved in many pks, except for the serine in e. coli. both threonine and serine contain hydroxyl groups, which might be important for its interaction with the activator. a study demonstrates that s <dig> grows normally in the medium containing glucose as the only carbon source  <cit> . we, therefore, suspected the mutant on pk might not be a major reason for s <dig> attenuation. further biochemical studies are still necessary to clarify this conclusion.

although brucella spp. is considered typically as non-motile, a study demonstrates that flagellar genes are necessary for the assembly of a functional flagellum  <cit> . b. melitensis with flif mutant is unable to replicate in macrophages and hela cells, suggesting the brucella flagellar genes might be related to virulence  <cit> . another study shows that in the early log phase of its growth in 2yt nutrient broth, b. melitensis expresses genes corresponding to the basal  and the distal parts of the flagellar apparatus. a polar and sheathed flagellar structure has been observed under transmission electron microscopy. although the mutations encoding different parts of the flagellum structure do not show a discernible phenotype when compared with the wild-type strain in cellular infection models, all these mutants are attenuated in mice infected via the intraperitoneal route in 4 weeks after infection  <cit> . we found a mutation in flif protein  located in ms ring. whether the mutation decreases the virulence of s <dig> awaits further studies.

other different proteins found between s <dig> and 1330
two iclr regulatory genes in s <dig> were different from those in  <dig>  the iclr regulatory gene located in chromosome i lacked 8 bp that began at atg, causing the loss of the coding protein. the other different iclr regulatory gene located in chromosome ii had a 1 bp deletion, resulting in the premature stop in the coding protein. members of the iclr transcription regulator family regulate a variety of metabolic processes in various microorganisms  <cit> . in one study, b. melitensis 16m mutations in arac, arsr, crp, deor, gntr, iclr, lysr, merr, rpir and tetr were constructed. gntr and lysr mutants showed the decreased virulence  <cit> . two different iclr regulatory genes found in s <dig> genome were correspondent to iclr <dig> and iclr <dig> in the study. therefore, the lack of these two iclr regulatory genes might not be the major cause for s <dig> attenuation.

in chromosome i of s <dig>  omp2b had two residues different from that in  <dig>  omp2b is bacterial porins present in the outer membrane of brucella. the differences in the omp2b variants are located in the predicted external loops of the porin  <cit> . the first different residue  is highly conserved in different brucella strains, while the second different residue  is not strictly conserved. omp2b is present in virulent b. abortus, b. melitensis and b. suis strains that are pathogenic to humans, but is absent in non-pathogenic b. ovis  <cit> . bacterial porins have been reported to be involved in apoptosis modulation . expression of b. melitensis omp2b in yeast prevents the cell from death induced by the mammalian pro-apoptotic protein bax  <cit> . no further functional studies have been reported on brucella omp2b.

high-affinity binding protein-dependent abc transporter consists of a high-affinity periplasmic substrate-binding subunit, two hydrophobic membrane subunits and two additional cytoplasmic subunits. atp hydrolysis by associated atpase provides the energy for substrate accumulation across the inner membrane against the concentration gradient. periplasmic substrate-binding subunits are composed of two separate but similarly folded globular domains, which are connected by a hinge region made of two or three short polypeptide segments  <cit> . in s <dig> chromosome i, 1 bp difference in periplasmic sugar-binding protein caused one residue difference  in protein sequence compared with that in  <dig> strain. the sequence alignment with structure-solute receptor gach of streptomyces glaucescens  showed that this residue was located very close to the substrate binding site. due to the bulky structure of tyrosine, we suspected the mutation might affect the sugar binding affinity or preference of the protein. the comparative proteome study on b. melitensis vaccine strain rev  <dig> and virulent strain 16 m reveals that four sugar-binding proteins are differentially expressed in rev  <dig>  although these two strains have similar physical properties in biotyping tests  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the substrate preference change might help bacteria adapt to different growth conditions.

in s <dig> chromosome ii, 2 bp differences resulted in  <dig> residues difference in oligopeptide abc transporter. the first different residue  existed in other brucella strains, while the other different residue was only seen in s <dig> . bacteria utilize peptides as a source of amino acids, carbon, nitrogen, and/or energy. a variety of peptide uptake systems mediate the translocation of peptides across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. recent studies show that oppa possesses preference in substrate peptide. e. coli oppa prefers positively charged peptides with three or four amino acids in length. however, other studies also suggest that the substrate preference of the peptide uptake systems are more complicated  <cit> . the sequence alignment with the homologous structure of oligopeptide-binding protein from salmonella typhimurium  <cit>  showed that residue  <dig> was located close to the substrate binding site, but not involved in direct interaction with the substrate. compared with other available structures of oligopeptide-binding proteins, the residue  <dig> of oppa protein can be glutamate , serine , alanine  or tyrosine . meanwhile, two oligopeptide-binding proteins were encoded in  <dig> genome, which shared 84 % similarity in protein sequences. the residue at  <dig> is aspartate in the other sequence, suggesting this residue was not conserved well in different bacteria. atp-binding cassette transporter in brucella ovis is shown to be essential in mice  <cit> . the Δabcab mutant strain can trigger host serologic responses similar to the wt strain and a significant cellular host response  <cit> .

one residue different in s <dig> was found in a deda family protein. the deda family proteins are integral inner membrane proteins, which are present in nearly all species of bacteria. e. coli encodes  <dig> deda proteins. although each of them is nonessential, they are collectively essential  <cit> . an e. coli mutant with two deda genes deletion  fails to complete cell division or grow at elevated temperatures  <cit> . b. burgdorferi possesses only one deda gene. the gene deletion results in imbalanced membrane phospholipid composition, which is required for proper cell division and envelope integrity  <cit> . no functional clue was suggested for brucella deda so far.

we identified a difference at residue  <dig> between s <dig> and  <dig> in a putative molybdopterin-binding oxidoreductase. members of the molybdopterin oxidoreductase family include formate dehydrogenase, nitrate reductase, dmso reductase, tmao reductase, pyrogallol hydroxytransferase and arsenate reductase. the protein in s <dig> showed about 40 % similarity with formate dehydrogenase h from e. coli at residues 54– <dig>  as suggested by the protein databank search with blastp. the residues involved in mo binding are conserved  <cit> . no significant sequence similarity was found between these two proteins around residue  <dig> 

a 1 bp insertion caused the premature stop of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase in s <dig>  3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for the metabolism of valine and some keto-bodies, exists widely in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue. it catalyzes the reversible conversion of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate to methylmalonate semialdehyde  <cit> . although the enzymatic properties of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase have been studies in several organisms, its relevance to bacterial virulence awaits further studies.

nadh-quinone oxidoreductase subunit  <dig>  in s <dig> had one different residue compared with that of  <dig> strain. nuof is part of the hydrophilic fragment of nadh dehydrogenase i, which represents the electron input part of the enzyme nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase. it couples electron transport to proton translocation across the membrane, which is partially responsible for generating the proton gradient necessary for atp production. nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase serves as both a proton pump and an entry point for electrons into the respiratory chain  <cit> . currently, no bacterial virulence is associated with this gene.

one residue difference was found in lepa gene between s <dig> and  <dig>  lepa protein encoded by this gene exists in most of the bacterial genomes  <cit> . although lepa knockout strain of e. coli  <cit>  and staphylococcus aureus  <cit>  are viable, the gene product might be necessary for bacteria survival under certain growth conditions  <cit> .

there are other different proteins between s <dig> and  <dig> . when we analyzed the sequences, we did not find any functional implications of the proteins in bacteria. therefore, further studies are needed to clarify their links to virulence attenuation of s <dig> strain.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we sequenced the attenuated strain brucella suis s <dig> genome and performed comparative genome analysis between s <dig> and virulent strain  <dig>  during the analysis, we found out  <dig> different orfs between these two strains. of these different orfs, several have been reported to be related to brucella virulence, such as outer membrane autotransporter, eryd. the proteins encoded by some of the different genes have been suggested to be essential for bacteria growth, such as deda, phosphorglucosamine mutase and phosphatidylcholine synthase. these gene products might be responsible for the utilization of the materials from the environment, which are necessary for bacteria growth. we found several mutations in peptide-binding atp transporter and sugar-binding atp transporter, but their roles on s <dig> attenuation could not be ruled out without further investigation.

it has been shown that the high concentration of erythritol in the foetal tissues of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs might be beneficial for the growth of brucella. erythritol catabolism pathway may play important physiological roles in brucella. the studies in s <dig> and s <dig> showed that eryd might act as the repressor of erythritol operon  <cit> . in our experiment, we found that s <dig> but not s <dig> could grow in the media supplemented with erythritol, suggesting s <dig> has the ability to metabolize erythritol. therefore, further investigation on the function of the eryd gene is necessary to clarify its relevance to virulence attenuation.

although we identified some target proteins that might be related to the virulence, most of the identified proteins have not been investigated in brucella. therefore, all these genes have to be examined individually to ensure their relationships with the virulence. the modification of the genes identified in our study will help to reduce residual virulence, which is critical to developing more efficient brucella vaccine strains.
