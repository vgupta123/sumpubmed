BACKGROUND
myanmar , the largest country in mainland southeast asia , covers an area of  <dig>  km <dig> and is inhabited by ~ <dig> million people. the fast evolutionary rate  <cit>  and the non-recombining uniparental inheritance  <cit>  of the mitochondrial dna  generally qualifies mtdna as highly potent marker for population and phylogenetic studies and mtdna analyses have a long tradition in the exploration of human evolution  <cit> . thanks to increasing knowledge on its mutation rate  <cit>  mtdna is also a valid tool for age estimates. although myanmar plays a crucial role for the population history of southeast asia  <cit> , due to the long-lasting isolation of the country by its political regime, only very few mitochondrial dna  data are available so far  <cit> . in order to close this gap on the genetic map of southeast asia, we collected dna samples from  <dig> unrelated donors originating from  <dig> of the  <dig> political regions representing the most important ethnic groups of myanmar and genotyped the entire mitochondrial control region  of all samples and the entire mitochondrial genome of a subset of  <dig> selected samples.

this dataset from myanmar is of great historic interest, because sea is a key region of human population history with a first entry of anatomically modern humans of african descent about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> , who continued their way through the coastal route to island sea and australia  <cit> . following the glacial retreat in that area, also a north- and eastward migration towards the yangtse and yellow river basins of the ancestors of sino-tibetan tribes began  <cit> . so, also the initial colonization of china and the rest of east asia had its origin in sea  <cit> . much later, probably driven by a neolithic agricultural revolution, the tibeto-burman  branches of sino-tibetans moved back southwards through yunnan to myanmar and the sea peninsula  <cit> . ruled by changing kingdoms and dynasties  <cit> , occupied by the british empire  and lying on the trade route between india and china  <cit> , myanmar was influenced by a variety of cultures.

analyzing mtdna data from myanmar is of great genetic interest, because in spite of accumulating knowledge in recent years  <cit>  the resolution of the mitochondrial haplogroup phylogeny in sea, especially in macrohaplogroup m, is still very low  <cit>  compared to west-eurasian haplogroups. moreover, in population size analyses on mitochondrial dna data, atkinson et al.  discovered that on the indian subcontinent plus mainland sea the first pronounced population expansion outside africa took place around  <dig>  years ago, and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years before present the majority of the global population of homo sapiens lived in that area  <cit> .

finally this dataset is also of sociocultural interest, because myanmar is subdivided into more than  <dig> ethnic groups amongst them the bamar represent 68% of the population. other important minorities are shan , karen , arakanese , chinese  and the ethno-linguistically related mon and khmer . since myanmar’s independence from the british occupation, a lot of tensions emerged between the ruling bamar and the remaining ethnic minorities, who suffered from government’s repression  <cit> . amongst others especially the karen people struggle against the domination of the bamar culture  <cit> .

with this study we expected to address the following historic questions: is the changeful history of myanmar reflected in its mitochondrial dna diversity? how does its population structure fit into the overall picture of sea? was there a contribution of indo-european language speakers to the genepool of myanmar through the north indian corridor or from the time as british colony? in addition, we aimed at contributing to the picture of human colonization of the asian continent with the description and dating of new mitochondrial haplogroups. finally, we were searching for mitochondrial genetic footprints of the ethnic heterogeneity of myanmar and for signs of genetic isolation of individual ethnic groups.

RESULTS
haplogroup composition and new lineages
the study included  <dig> dna samples from myanmar citizens, who lived in northern thailand at the time of sample collection. the myanmar sample, consisting of  <dig> mitochondrial control region sequences and  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes, which constitute a subset of the  <dig> control region samples, exhibited pronounced mtdna diversity displaying  <dig> distinct cr lineages, including eight in this study newly defined haplogroups and three different not classified basal m branches . f1a1a with  <dig> % of all sequences was by far the most frequent haplogroup in this study, followed by c4b <dig> , b <dig>  and a <dig> . r9b1a1a, d <dig> and g2b1a reached  <dig> % each. the  <dig> individuals actually belonging to m split into  <dig> different haplogroups,  <dig> of them with only a single representative. the most common haplogroup in m was m21a  .

the  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes revealed  <dig> so far undescribed mtdna lineages, most of them lying within macrohaplogroup m . one lineage, comprising  <dig> haplotypes, clustered within haplogroup g <dig> and was termed g2b1a <dig> . two new lineages represented subgroups of haplogroup m <dig>  and were named m49e  and its subgroup m49e <dig> . another lineage comprising  <dig> haplotypes was called m20a . four haplotypes shared the mutations at positions  <dig> and  <dig> with haplogroup m13′46′ <dig> as defined in phylotree v. <dig>  <cit> , but did not cluster consistently into this group in our phylogenetic analyses. accordingly, we classified them as new haplogroup m <dig> , which was supported by  <dig> shared mutations and haplogroup m90a , which was supported by  <dig> additional mutations. five more sequences branched at the very base of macrohaplogroup m, three of them as separate new lineages  with only one representative, but one lineage composed of two haplotypes sharing  <dig> mutations with a previously published sequence   <cit>  and was therefore entitled as haplogroup m <dig> . one more mitochondrial lineage, a subgroup of b6a comprising of two haplotypes sharing  <dig> additional mutations was defined as new haplogroup b6a <dig> . the remaining  <dig> sequences could be assigned to existing haplogroups, but in most of them a lot of “private” mutations were observed  which probably will lead to new lineages with cumulating sequence information in future studies.

population structure of myanmar
out of the  <dig> provinces  of myanmar,  <dig> provinces were represented in this study, the majority of samples coming from the karen state. detailed information on origin and cultural background of the sample donors is illustrated in figure 2a and listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  figure 2b illustrates the main haplogroup distribution of myanmar compared to four other southeast asian regions: thailand  <cit> , laos  <cit> , vietnam  <cit>  and hong kong  <cit> . the myanmar sample was typical for southeast asian populations with a high percentage of r9’f and b lineages as well as a variety of m haplogroups. the minor contribution of n lineages  to the gene pool also turned out to be characteristic for southeast asia. noticeable was a relatively high percentage of a and c lineages in myanmar compared to the neighboring countries . within the myanmar sample, two ethnic groups were predominant: the bamar  and the karen . separate analyses of these two groups revealed that the observed over-representation of haplogroups a  and c  were mainly caused by the karen population whereas the dominance of different m lineages  was much more pronounced in the bamar population.

in the multi-dimensional scaling plot of pairwise fst-values  of populations from myanmar and  <dig> other asian regions a distinct geographical pattern appeared. the myanmar sample fitted well within the southeast asian cluster, whereas the population sample from laos appeared as an outlier . central asian populations formed a second cluster, the korean sample represented east asia, afghanistan could be seen as south asian and russia as western eurasian representative. the haplogroup distribution of myanmar was representative for the overall haplogroup distribution of southeast asia . the distribution of n-lineages  was eye-catching with very low percentages in southeast and east asia, about 50% in central asia, more than 75% in afghanistan and 100% in the sample of russian origin. also the proportion of the american founding haplogroups a, b, c and d displayed an interesting pattern: from inexistent in russians, it appeared as a minor percentage in afghanistan and became more abundant in central asia  and southeast asia  and had its climax with more than 50% in east asian korea.

comparison of the bamar and the karen people, two main ethnic groups in myanmar
the sample within myanmar turned out to be very inhomogeneous concerning the two different ethnic groups . pairwise mismatch distribution plots indicated different demographic histories with signs of a strong and recent demographic expansion for the bamar, and evidence of a demographic equilibrium for the karen people. within karen we saw effects of genetic isolation from the mismatch distribution with many sequences showing minimal differences and also from the haplogroup composition with a high percentage of samples falling into identical haplogroups. in contrast, the haplogroup composition of bamar was exceptionally diverse with  <dig> different haplogroups and a maximum of  <dig> samples in the same haplogroup . multi-dimensional scaling plots of pairwise fst-values  from the two ethnic groups of bamar and karen and the four other southeast asian populations  showed that thailand, vietnam and hong kong appeared as a southeast asian cluster, whereas the two burmese samples were far away from each other.

migration analyses
migration analyses of myanmar and four southeast asian regions displayed a vivid exchange of genetic material between the countries and demonstrated a strong outwards migration of myanmar to all analyzed neighboring regions . the migration rate from myanmar to the neighboring country thailand was  <dig> -times higher than the migration rate from thailand to myanmar. nearly twice as many people seemed to emigrate from myanmar to laos than laotians immigrated to myanmar. while the migration rates between myanmar and vietnam were nearly balanced, we observed a  <dig> -time higher emigration rate from myanmar to hong kong than from hong kong to myanmar. although the calculated migrations values and directions were not entirely consistent across the five analyses, in summary the effective migration rates characterized myanmar genetically as an emigrating population.

age estimates of new haplogroups
the age estimates of the eight newly described haplogroups fell into four different periods. the oldest haplogroup m <dig> with an estimated age of  <dig>   years dated in the pleistocene, long before the last glacial maximum . the haplogroups m <dig> with an estimated age of  <dig>   years and m49e  emerged at the beginning of the lgm, whereas the age of m49e <dig>  denoted the end of the lgm. the four remaining new haplogroups turned out to be much younger: b6a <dig>  and m20a  dated at the beginning of the holocene, whereas the youngest new haplogroups m90a  and g2b1a <dig>  fell into the metal ages.

discussion
tracing the reasons for myanmar’s extraordinarily diverse population structure
myanmar turned out to be a hotspot for mitochondrial dna diversity in southeast asia : the analyzed  <dig> mitochondrial control region sequences could be assigned to  <dig> different haplogroups  and from  <dig> complete mitochondrial genome sequences  <dig> new lineages emerged . this diversity can partly be explained by sea’s long population history of over  <dig>  years  <cit> , and by the hypothesis that due to a pleistocene population expansion, ~60% of the global human population lived in that area about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . its geographic position on the trade route between the vast empires of india and china  <cit>  and along the way of important migration events at several different time periods  <cit>  could be another explanation for myanmar’s haplogroup diversity. furthermore, burma’s population structure with more than  <dig> ethnicities scattered over a geographically differentiated country could have also contributed to its genetic variability. such great variety of m-lineages as we found in myanmar has only been described before in india  <cit> . therefore, the prior hypothesis that the diversification of macrohaplogroup m originated in india  <cit>  and that basal m-lineages spread to myanmar could be extended by the theory that the radiation of m-lineages took place in a geographically wider area including southeast asia. regarding the most frequent haplogroups, an interesting picture arose: in addition to the expected sea groups  <cit>  f1a1a , r9b1a1a , and m21a  , the five other frequent mitochondrial haplogroups from our burma sample  mainly represented northeast and east asian lineages  <cit> . b <dig>  and d <dig> , however, were also found in island sea  <cit> . a closer look on the newly described lineages  further supports an astonishing intermediate biogeographic position of myanmar: m20a descends from a recently described haplogroup m <dig>  found in mainland sea  <cit>  and southern china  <cit> . also the new lineage m <dig>  directly descending from the m-node, has a previously detected member from southern china   <cit> . the new haplogroup m49e and its subgroup m49e <dig>  in contrast, derive from a lineage  only described from tribal populations in northeast india  <cit>  and g2b1a <dig> as well as b6a <dig> arise from east asian haplogroups  <cit> . the remaining new haplogroup m <dig> with its subgroup m90a as well as the three new lineages with only one representative support the assumption of a native emergence of basal m-lineages in this region. despite the before mentioned specific features of myanmar, the overall main haplogroup composition  and the pairwise fst-values  characterize the country as a typical sea population. the characteristic mainland sea haplogroups  <cit>  b5a, f1a1a and m7b* were abundant in myanmar , only the m7-group was with  <dig> % clearly under-represented compared to the four other sea populations  <cit>  included in this study . the further exceptions from sea populations, namely the high percentages of the mainly east asian haplogroups a and c  and the extraordinary diversity of superhaplogroup m*, could be attributed to the intrinsic characteristic of two ethnic groups: the over-representation of the haplogroups a <dig>  and c4b <dig>  in the karen population compared to other southeast asian populations  was the reason for the observed high percentage of east asian haplogroups, and the large variety of haplogroup m in the bamar population  was responsible for the unexpected diversity of the m-cluster in myanmar. taken all together, burma’s mitochondrial haplogroup composition, reflecting the country’s geographic position as well as its complex population structure, generally fits into the overall southeast asian picture, but adds important findings to it.

bamar and karen share the same country but are genetically contrasting populations
the haplogroup composition of the two main ethnic groups in our study, the numerically  and politically dominating group in myanmar, the bamar, and the most repressed and also most separatist ethnicity, the karen , differed enormously: the bamar sample with its  <dig> different mitochondrial lineages was extraordinarily diverse, whereas almost three quarters  of the karen population could be assigned to only five haplogroups .the multi-dimensional scaling plot of fst-values  underlined those differences. pairwise mismatch distribution plots showed signs of a recent demographic expansion for the bamar, but demographic equilibrium and many sequences with minimal differences in the karen population pointed to effects of genetic isolation . the conclusion that bamar and karen differ genetically is not new: a study on cyp2c19* <dig> allele frequencies, an important gene for the response to barbiturates and malaria drugs  <cit>  and a survey on heme-oxygenase  <dig> promoter polymorphisms  <cit>  found significant differences between participants of bamar or karen origin. these findings could be interpreted both historically and by recent sociocultural aspects of present-time myanmar: although bamar and karen both are of tibeto-burman origin and derive from ancient tribes of northwestern china  <cit> , their history differs: the bamar migrated from yunnan/china into the irrawaddy valley in the 7th century ad, thereby replacing and absorbing the original tribes of pyu and mon  <cit> . in the course of that absorption they presumably “incorporated” older local haplogroups  <cit> . the ethnic origin of the karen and the migration routes before their arrival in myanmar around the sixth century ad is largely unknown  <cit> . their own legends tell about an ancestry from a “sandy region in the north”, sometimes interpreted as the gobi desert, but a more plausible explanation includes an origin in the yellow river region, and a migration over yunnan along the salween or mekong into today’s shan state and then into the mountain regions farther south   <cit> . the karen claim to be amongst the first settlers of myanmar and despite their diverse linguistic and cultural subgroups, their different religions and different geographic locations, they define themselves as unity with a clear dissociation from the bamar  <cit> . suppression and displacement of karen and other peoples were already documented in the 18th century  <cit> , and many karen fled and still flee to thailand  <cit> . even until very recently, there was an armed conflict between the bamar government and the karen national union in myanmar  <cit> . another reason for the observed dissimilarity between those two ethnic groups could be the traditionally matrilocal and matrilineal culture of the karen  <cit> , which cannot be found in the bamar. while the haplogroup diversity for mitochondrial dna is supposed to be generally lower within matrilocal groups than within patrilocal groups and vice versa for the y-chromosome  <cit> , an analogous pattern in genetic diversity was not confirmed with y-chromosome data, where burmese-lolo  and karen were shown to exhibit similar haplotype patterns  <cit> . in summary, the distinct genetic dissimilarity between bamar and karen seems to result, besides their different population sizes, not so much from geographic separation of the two ethnic groups, but from divergent population histories and even more from their different cultural traditions and social constraints.

can the genetic influence of myanmar on its neighboring countries be explained by their shared ancestry alone or is it partially caused by politically forced migration events?
the recent history of myanmar, with its isolation politics lasting for decades, resulted in a very low published immigration estimate of  <dig>  persons per  <dig> inhabitants and a net emigration estimate of  <dig> / <dig> migrants per year . therefore, the genetically manifested vivid exchange of myanmar with neighboring regions and an emigration exceeding immigration by over 30% , is an interesting finding. the magnitude of the observed migration rates could reflect the widely shared population history of myanmar, thailand, laos, vietnam and south china, all descending from sino-tibetan tribes  <cit> . however, the majority of the present genetic exchange, particularly with the thai population, seems to originate from the karen minority: the thai samples included in this study come from the chiang mai region  <cit> , where traditionally many karen live, nowadays a considerable proportion of them as refugees  <cit> . migration analyses, especially the dominating outwards migration, could therefore also indicate an active marginalization and displacement of ethnic minorities, especially of the karen people with ~ <dig>  karen refugees alone in thailand.

did climate change and cultural inventions influence human population history in mainland southeast asia?
the timing of the most recent common ancestor of the youngest newly described haplogroups m90a  and g2b1a <dig>  falls into a time of cultural change. an agricultural revolution in southern china with subsequent expansion to mainland and island sea took place around that time  <cit> . haplogroup g2b1a <dig>  originating from east asian lineages  <cit>  would perfectly trace this migration wave. the emerging of haplogroups m20a and b6a <dig> in the early holocene, together with f1a1a also appearing in indochina at the same time  <cit> , fits perfectly into a time of a supposed expansion of people from mainland sea and southern china, possibly driven by global warming and sea level rises, to island sea  <cit> . the potential northeast indian haplogroup m49e  and its subgroup m49e <dig>  appear at the beginning, respectively versus the end of the lgm, which would be a typical coalescent time of east asian lineages in northeast asia  <cit> . also the new southeast asian lineage m <dig>  dates at the beginning of the lgm together with r9b, another lineage from indochina  <cit> . it is not clear what could have driven a diversification of mitochondrial haplogroups in sea during the lgm; perhaps an extension of settlement area to the current islands of sumatra, java and borneo, being parts of the asian mainland at that time, could serve as an explanation. about the emerging of haplogroup m <dig>  in the pleistocene and the additional three undated new basal m-lineages we can only speculate that the proposed population expansion in south and southeast asia between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years before present  <cit>  resulted in new haplogroups. the age estimates of our eight newly described haplogroups, together with previously published coalescence times of other lineages, point to the existence of distinct “evolutionary time slots” where climatic as well as cultural changes gave rise to mitochondrial haplogroup diversification in southeast asia.

strengths and limitations
this survey provides detailed insight into human mitochondrial dna evolution in myanmar for the first time, and thereby sheds more light onto a crucial stage of southeast asian population history. our study collection was selected with the aim of covering a maximum of myanmar’s diversity; indeed, it included samples from every political region except mandalay division, and from  <dig> different ethnicities including the numerically most important. at the same time it provides sufficient sample depth to address ethnicity specific questions in the case of bamar and karen, and therefore optimizes the information content within the limits of a manageable sample size. another important strength of this study represent the personal interviews with each study participant following a sophisticated questionnaire and therefore making assignment problems or misinterpretations by third persons very unlikely. thanks to this questionnaire , we were able to obtain reliable information on age, sex, specific ethnicity and geographic origin of the participants, and in addition also the places of birth of maternal ancestors of the preceding two generations were compiled.

however, a major limitation of our study is that samples were collected from myanmar citizens living in northern thailand at the time of sample collection, and were not collected in myanmar per se. in addition, our dataset still suffers, compared to the actual demographic situation of myanmar, from an uneven sample distribution with an under-representation of the populous irrawaddy basin. for important ethnic groups like shan, arakanese, mon and chin, sample sizes were too small to address sub-population specific questions. a second caveat of this study in regard of demographic estimates is that mtdna, even the complete mtdna genome, only represents a single locus. we negotiated those shortcomings by specifically addressing the bamar as the dominant group in myanmar, and the karen, representing the most persecuted and most separatist minority in myanmar, for population genetic analyses. we restricted the interpretation of the demographic analysis results to migration rates, where an estimate based on one locus is valid  <cit> .

conclusions and outlook
the multi-ethnic population and the complex history of myanmar were well reflected in its distinct mitochondrial dna heterogeneity. the mitochondrial haplogroup distribution in myanmar showed a typical southeast asian pattern, confirming earlier findings but also adding new information: the population sample of myanmar displayed quite a few parallels to north and northeast asian and also to south asian populations. no traces of european or african influence to the maternal gene pool of myanmar were detected. the population structure of the extraordinarily diverse bamar differed substantially from that of the karen people who displayed signs of genetic isolation. these results, together with the genetically manifested net outwards migration to neighboring regions, raise questions about the sociocultural circumstances in myanmar. the description and dating of eight new mitochondrial haplogroups and the detection of three further basal m lineages shed more light on the population history of southeast asia.

this study resulted in important findings, but, as always with gaining knowledge, further questions arise: does the genetic pattern of other ethnic groups in myanmar, respectively in southeast asia, display such great differences as bamar and karen? what does this imply in terms of cultural and social issues? is the exceptional haplogroup diversity found in bamar so very special in this region and if this is the case, what lies behind that? how would the overall picture of a detailed study from a country in the same region, but with a more homogeneous ethnic structure differ from that of myanmar? to address these and many more questions, it seems worth spending time on developing sound study designs with meaningful questionnaires going into detail in terms of biogeographic and cultural population characteristics like the presence and distribution of ethnic groups. furthermore, the phylogeny of the human mitochondrial genome, especially in macrohaplogroup m, is far from being exhaustively investigated and a plethora of new lineages still await to be discovered in future studies. the use of next generation sequencing technologies will help to obtain more complete mitochondrial genome data in a shorter time span, but one always has to keep an eye on highest sequence quality, a prerequisite for indisputable findings.

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> entire mtdna genomes uncovered eight new haplogroups and three unclassified basal m-lineages. the multi-ethnic population and the complex history of myanmar were reflected in its mtdna heterogeneity. population genetic analyses of burmese control region sequences combined with population data from neighboring countries revealed that the myanmar haplogroup distribution showed a typical southeast asian pattern, but also northeast asian and indian influences. the population structure of the extraordinarily diverse bamar differed from that of the karen people, who displayed signs of genetic isolation. migration analyses indicated a considerable genetic exchange with an overall positive migration balance from myanmar to neighboring countries. age estimates of the newly described haplogroups point to the existence of evolutionary windows where climatic and cultural changes gave rise to mitochondrial haplogroup diversification in asia.
