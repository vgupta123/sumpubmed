BACKGROUND
brassinosteroids  are plant polyhydroxylated steroids that function as growth-promoting hormones. they have been implicated in many developmental and physiological processes in arabidopsis thaliana, including vascular differentiation, stem and root elongation, reproductive development, photomorphogenesis, and stress responses. hence, mutant plants defective in br synthesis or perception display characteristic phenotypes such us short stature, round, curled leaves, short petioles, and reduce fertility .

the br-biosynthetic and signaling pathways have been well studied in arabidopsis thaliana. a family of enzymes belonging to cytochrome p450s mediates most of the steps of br biosynthesis, and characterization of mutants defective in these enzymes contributed to the understanding of br biology  <cit> . various approaches have established the components and mechanisms of the br signaling pathway; once br binds to the receptor kinase, brassinosteroid-insensitive  <dig> , transmits the signal to downstream genes, eventually leading to the repression or activation of br responsive genes  <cit> .

it appears that br signaling is conserved between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, as some counterparts of the arabidopsis proteins are present in oryza sativa . for instance, orthologs of the receptor bri <dig> and co-receptor bri1-associated receptor kinase  <dig> , named osbri <dig> and osbak <dig>  respectively; two homologs of the negative regulator of the br signaling protein br insensitive  <dig> , gsk3/shaggy-like kinase  <dig> and  <dig> ; and an ortholog of a major transcription factor in the br transduction pathway brassinazole resistant  <dig>  have been identified in rice .

despite the similarities with dicot br biology, some differences have been noted in monocots too. brassinolide , the most active form of br and end product of br synthesis in arabidopsis, has not been detected in rice, where apparently castasterone  seems to be the end product. furthermore, no homolog of cyp85a <dig>  which mediates bl synthesis, has been found in rice  <cit> . in addition, components of br signaling with no known orthologs in arabidopsis have been identified in rice, indicating the existence of specific br functions in monocots or some degree of functional redundancy. examples of these components are dwarf and low-tillering  and tiller angle increased controller , which act downstream of osbri <dig> and osgsk <dig> to positively and negatively regulate rice br signaling, respectively  <cit> , and the u <dig> ubiquitin ligase taihu dwarf  <dig> , which interacts genetically and physically with d1/osrga, a heterotrimeric g protein subunit involved in gibberellin  and br responses  <cit> .


brachypodium distachyon  is a relatively new model plant proposed for the study of grasses, since it has a short live cycle, is self-fertile, easy to grow, and is more closely related to poaceae than is a. thaliana  <cit> . however, little is known about phytohormones in b. distachyon. only two dwarf mutants, with defects in the bri <dig> receptor and a c- <dig> oxidase , have been characterized in this model plant  <cit> .

in the present work, we used a specific br biosynthesis inhibitor drug, propiconazole   <cit> , to study br action in brachypodium and characterize orthologs of the br-biosynthetic enzymes dwarf <dig>  br6ox <dig>  and cpd. furthermore, by heterologous complementation, we studied homologs of two important genes in the br signaling pathway, the receptor bri <dig> and the negative regulator bin <dig>  this work revealed important similarities and differences between the br synthesis and signaling pathways in arabidopsis and brachypodium.

RESULTS
brachypodium distachyon seedlings display br-related phenotypes in response to propiconazole treatment
since brachypodium is a relatively new model plant, studies of processes and genes regulated by phytohormones in this organism are limited. the unavailability of brachypodium br-defective or -insensitive mutants made it challenging to determine if br function is conserved across plant species. to study the mode of action of brs and the factors involved in these processes, we first treated brachypodium bd <dig> seedlings with the br-specific inhibitor pcz in concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 50 μm for 7 days . we observed a dose-response reduction of the total lengths of plants; 1 μm pcz resulted in a ~13% reduction in length compared to mock conditions, whereas 50 μm, the greatest concentration tested, resulted in a ~60% reduction . this reduction was especially severe in roots; the main root was reduced by 50% in plants treated with 20 μm pcz relative to control plants, and by over 74% in those treated with 50 μm . the pcz-induced inhibitory effects were observed under both light and dark conditions . in contrast to the effect on the overall length of the plant, leaf length was only reduced by ~25% under the strongest pcz treatment . to evaluate if pcz had other effects on leaf morphology or the vascular system, we examined the leaf architecture in more detail, focusing on venation patterns, total number of veins, vein density, and distance between veins. interestingly, we found that pcz-treated leaves were thicker and wider than those from plants grown under control conditions, but that the number of veins remained the same. as a consequence, the distance between veins is on average greater in the treated leaves, so vein density is reduced by pcz treatment .fig.  <dig> brachypodium seedlings exhibit dose-dependent dwarfism in response to propiconazole treatment. a total lengths of seedlings and  roots after 7 days of exposure to  <dig>  to 50 μm pcz. c morphology of 7-days-old seedlings subjected to the mock treatment and the strongest pcz concentration tested. the graphs represent average value  and error bars standard deviation. significant differences among treatments were determined by student’s t-test. **, p <  <dig>  and ***, p <  <dig>

identification of genes modulating br response in brachypodium
with the release of the whole genome sequence of brachypodium distachyon, we were able to search for homologs that could participate in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling in this species. we conducted a blast search of the brachypodium database using the amino acid sequences of arabidopsis proteins and then used multiple sequence alignment  and phylogenetic analysis to reduce the number of homolog candidates to one per protein for further evaluation. in the case of bin <dig>  the msa and phylogenetic analysis were performed using arabidopsis bin <dig>  bin2-like  <dig> , and bin2-like  <dig>  and also the rice homologs osgsk <dig>  osgsk <dig>  and ossketha. we also performed a second msa, including a. thaliana bin <dig>  a gsk <dig> from human  and d. melanogaster , and rice osketha  using the t-coffee program to screen for conserved motifs. we observed that the kinase domain and the tree domain, identified as being a putative thr phosphorylation site by caseine kinase ii and thus important for negative regulatory events, were also present in the brachypodium homolog . thus, we selected bradi2g <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  bradi1g <dig>  bradi1g <dig>  bradi4g <dig>  and bradi1g <dig> as homologs of bri <dig>  bin <dig>  bsu <dig>  bzr <dig>  dwf <dig>  cpd, and br6ox <dig>  respectively, for further characterization.fig.  <dig> bdbin <dig> shows conserved motifs with other gsk3/shaggy-like kinase proteins. part of the multiple sequence alignment  of the bin <dig> ortholog in brachypodium  with atbin <dig>  and a gsk <dig> homolog from human  and d. melanogaster . the conserved protein kinase domain is underlined in red and the tree domain, which is well conserved in plants, is represented by a blue rectangle




brachypodium dwf <dig>  cpd, and br6ox <dig> homologs are under feedback regulation
to verify that the genes identified by bioinformatics tools were in effect orthologs of br biosynthetic genes in b. distachyon, we examined their transcripts levels in seedlings subjected to various pcz treatments. to obtain a general sense of the gene expression response to the treatments, we performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis on seedlings treated with three different concentrations of pcz  along with mock. we noticed that the transcript levels of the three br-related genes increased with increasing pcz concentrations. the ga biosynthesis gene ga20ox <dig> was used as a control for the pcz treatment, to ensure that only br-related genes were inhibited by the treatment . after determining the conditions that produced a clear transcriptional response, we carried out a similar experiment using just mock and one pcz concentration  to analyze bddwf <dig>  bdbr6ox <dig>  and bdcpd mrna levels by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. for the first two genes, pcz-treated seedlings exhibited a more than six-fold increase in expression with respect to the mock treatment, while bdcpd was only slightly upregulated . nonetheless all three candidate genes were found to be under negative feedback regulation, a characteristic of genes involved in br biosynthesis. normally, the expression of these genes is inhibited by the presence of br and enhanced when br levels are low such as under treatment with inhibitors . thus, bradi1g <dig> , bradi4g <dig> , and bradi1g <dig>  may indeed be involved in br biosynthesis in brachypodium distachyon.fig.  <dig> feedback regulation of brachypodium br biosynthetic genes after pcz treatments. a semi-quantitative rt-pcr of putative br biosynthetic genes bddwf <dig>  bdbr6ox <dig>  and bdcpd and the ga biosynthetic gene bdga20ox after treatment with the indicated concentrations of pcz and a mock control. bdact <dig> is used as an internal loading control. b-d quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis evaluating the expression of the same genes under just mock or 50 μm pcz




overexpression of bddwf <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana produce long and slender plants
to further evaluate the involvement of bddwf <dig> in br responses, we introduced the full-length coding sequence of this gene into a. thaliana under the camv 35 s promoter. from a total of  <dig> analyzed bddwf <dig> overexpressing lines , half displayed an increase in plant height and had longer and narrower leaves than the wild-type control, col- <dig> . these characteristics are typical of brassinosteroid-overproducing mutant plants, such as gulliver <dig> - d , in which the increase in br level is the result of activation tagging of dwf <dig>  analysis of the expression level in transgenic plants corroborated that degree of the phenotype is proportional to the levels of transcripts . the results strongly suggest that bradi1g <dig> plays a significant role in brachypodium growth and development, probably by functioning in the br biosynthetic pathway.fig.  <dig> phenotypes of the bddwf4ox and bdbin2ox transgenic lines, suggesting the involvement of bddwf <dig> in br biosynthesis and bdbin <dig> in responses, respectively. a morphology of three independent bddwf <dig> overexpression lines  along with wild type col- <dig> and gul3-d br overproducing mutant. b phenotypes of the wild type col- <dig> and bdbin <dig> overexpressing lines. line # <dig> represent mild phenotype, while # <dig> are examples of severe dwarfism. scale bar =  <dig> cms. c-d quantitative real-time analysis evaluating the heterologous expression of bddwf <dig> and bdbin <dig> respectively. line # <dig> c and # <dig>  which don’t show distinctive phenotype from wild type were used to compare expression of the rest of the lines. atubq <dig> was used as internal loading control




overexpression of bdbin <dig> in arabidopsis results in a stunted growth phenotype
we then overexpressed a candidate gene involved in br signaling bdbin <dig>  in a. thaliana to study the effect of this gene on the phenotypes of the transgenic plants. from a total of  <dig> analyzed lines, nearly 14% of the transgenic plants presented severe dwarf phenotypes, were unable to set flowers, and died after a few weeks . these extreme dwarf plants presented the highest level of transcript accumulation . other bdbin2ox lines showed milder phenotypes that were able to produce seeds but still exhibited a compact stature and smaller curled leaves compared with the wild type . these findings insinuate that bradi2g <dig> is a functional ortholog of brin <dig> in brachypodium that operates as a negative regulator of the br signaling pathway.

bdbri <dig> overexpression does not revert the weak phenotype of a. thaliana bri1-5
a search for bri <dig> in the brachypodium genome yielded three candidate genes  that we arranged in a phylogenetic tree along with other bri <dig> proteins described in various dicot , and tomato ) and monocot  and barley ) plants. as a reference, we also used bri1-like proteins brl <dig>  brl <dig>  and brl <dig> from arabidopsis and rice. as shown in figure 6a, we observed that the protein product of bradi2g <dig> was in the same group as orthologs of bri <dig> in monocots, and although it shares only ~53% amino acid sequence identity with atbri <dig>  it shares more than 80% identity with amino acid sequences in its monocot counterparts. to test if bradi2g <dig>  has the same functions as atbri <dig>  we performed heterologous complementation experiments. specifically, we examined if overexpression of bdbri <dig> was able to revert the dwarf phenotype of the br-insensitive bri1- <dig> mutant, which is a weak allele of atbri <dig>  in a first experiment we obtained  <dig> independent lines, all exhibiting dwarf phenotypes similar to bri1- <dig>  similarly, in a second transformation we obtained another  <dig> transgenic lines resistant to the basta which didn’t show rescued phenotypes ; bri1-5/bdbri1ox lines were slightly taller than the bri1- <dig> control, but were still dwarfed with abnormal leaf morphology . these results indicate that although bradi2g <dig> is likely a homolog of arabidopsis thaliana bri <dig>  these two genes may have different structure and/or functions that make bdbri <dig> incapable of operating as the br receptor in arabidopsis.fig.  <dig>

discussion
the use of knock-out and activation tagging mutants has facilitated the characterization of many important genes involved in phytohormone signaling and biosynthetic pathways. in the case of brs, the characterization of dwarf mutants mainly in arabidopsis has contributed to our current understanding of br biology. however, few studies have evaluated brs in poaceae, and most advances in these crops have been made in rice and maize . the lack of br-defective mutants is an obstacle in efforts to reveal br functions in other model plants and at the time this work started, just one br mutant had been identified in brachypodium  <cit> . subsequently, one more mutant defective in br biosynthesis has emerged  <cit> .

in this report, we sought to contribute to the knowledge of br biology using brachypodium as a model plant by measuring the effects of a potent and specific br inhibitor, pcz. we demonstrated that pcz treatments mimic the characteristic dwarf phenotypes of plants deficient in brassinosteroids and that the response is dose-dependent, similar to what was described for arabidopsis and maize  <cit> . treatments with 50 μm pcz caused severe phenotypes in seedlings, especially in the roots, where we observed a 75% decrease in length compared to the mock treatment, while the reduction in leaf length was almost 34%. the marked effect on roots may be due to the method used to apply pcz. as we planted the seedlings in vermiculite soil soaked with pcz solution, the roots were in permanent and direct contact with pcz, whereas the aerial tissue was not. still, this method was able to cause not only a decrease in leaf length, but also other phenotypes in the leaves that were similar to the ones described in transgenic rice plants overexpressing the br negative regulator bin <dig>  <cit> .

although the pcz-treated leaves initially seemed to develop relatively normally, they later curled, especially towards the top, and exhibited increased width and thickness compared to the mock treatments. further analyses using cross-sections of leaves could reveal more about the possible effects of pcz on venation pattern or cell organization in these tissues. considering the phenotypes obtained using the chemical inhibitor in brachypodium, we propose that pcz treatments represent a powerful tool for studying brs in this model plant. pcz could be administered to investigate vascular and stomatal development, root growth, cell elongation, and meristematic cell maintenance, among other specific processes in which br is known to play active roles  <cit> .

the br biosynthetic genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, and this regulation is mainly mediated by the transcription factor bzr <dig>  with supplemental regulation by other transcription factors. when br signaling is activated, the dephosphorylated  form of bzr <dig> binds to the promotor sequence of br synthetic genes to repress their transcription. this mechanism is known as negative feedback downregulation of br biosynthetic genes  <cit> . in this way, bl treatments reduce the expression of dwf <dig>  cpd, and br6ox <dig> while pcz application has the opposite effect since it reduce br levels  <cit> . considering this feedback regulation of the biosynthetic genes, we evaluated the transcript levels of our candidate br-related genes bddwf <dig> , bdcpd , and bdbr6ox  in seedlings subjected to pcz treatment. we observed the pcz-dependent induction of the three candidates tested, although the increase in bdcpd expression level was lower than that of the other two genes. however, a similar result was observed previously for arabidopsis cpd upon pcz application  <cit> , possibly because another mechanism regulates the post-transcriptional level of cpd. taken together, bddwf <dig>  bdcpd, and bdbr6ox are regulated by a feedback loop at the transcript level once br levels decrease upon pcz treatments, suggesting their possible role as enzymes involved in br synthesis.

to date, many br genes homologs to the ones characterized from a. thaliana have been identified in different monocot species and most of these works are based on the description of the phenotypes from mutant plants which in most of cases present dwarfism or other characteristic br-related phenotypes. nevertheless, not many of these studies examine the effects of the ectopic overexpression of these suggested homolog genes in arabidopsis to examine if they fulfill similar roles to its dicot equivalent. some exceptions are the overexpression of maize dwf <dig>  and rice gsk <dig>  one of the homologs of bin <dig>  in arabidopsis  <cit> . ectopic overexpression of zmdwf <dig> generated arabidopsis plants with longer petioles, narrower leaves, and increased size  <cit> , which is similar to the effects we obtained by overexpressing bddwf <dig>  this typical growth-promoting phenotype is also portrayed by transgenic plants overexpressing atdwf <dig>  <cit>  and the gain-of-function mutant gulliver <dig> - d/dwarf <dig> – d, which we used as a control to compare the effects of our overexpression  <cit> . in case of bin <dig>  opposite phenotypes are observed due to its role in modulating bzr1/bes <dig> degradation. heterologous expression of the rice bin <dig> homolog osgsk <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in plants that were barely one-third the height of control plants  <cit> . similarly, overexpression of bdbin <dig> affected plant height and other features in our experiments, but to a greater extent. this difference may be due to osgsk <dig> having a minor role in br signaling, since another homolog of bin <dig> in rice, osgsk <dig>  seems to be a more prominent negative regulator that functions upstream of transcription factors such as osbzr <dig>  lic, and dtl  <cit> .

homologs of the br receptor bri <dig> have been identified and studied in three monocot species to date, including rice, barley, and brachypodium . the functions of the bri <dig> homolog in brachypodium were revealed in studies of plants in which bdbri <dig> was silence by rnai technology  <cit> , while the homologs in the other two species were characterized using mutant plants. in addition to osbri <dig>  bri1-like homologs  have also been characterized in rice, and in both rice and barley different alleles of bri <dig> have been found in later works  <cit> . however, these studies failed to determine if the monocot homologs of bri <dig> are able to function as a br receptor in dicot plants. this fact is indeed important, since the end product of br synthesis and more active br in monocots does not seem to be brassinolide, but castasterone. thus, the structure of bri <dig> remained to be compared in monocot and dicot plants  <cit> . to do so, we first searched the brachypodium genome for bri <dig> putative homologs. we found that bradi2g <dig> likely functions as a br receptor in brachypodium  <cit> ; however, to test our hypothesis, we cloned the gene and heterologously expressed it in a. thaliana bri1- <dig> mutant plants. to our surprise, the full-length coding sequence of bdbri <dig> was not able to rescue the dwarf phenotype of bri1- <dig>  which is a weak allele of bri <dig>  this was observed despite the plants were expressing the brachypodium version of bri <dig> . several transgenic lines showed a slight increase in total plant height, but still presented extremely curled leaves and defects in flowering and seed formation. as far as we know, this is the first time a monocot version of bri <dig> has been expressed in a. thaliana to evaluate if complementation is possible. our results represent an early step for comparing the functions and structures of bri <dig> between dicot and monocot plants and thus broaden the understanding about br response in crop plants. brs have profound effects on several physiological responses such as plant size, fertility and leaves inclination, thus good biotechnological targets to manipulate plant architecture towards desirable agronomic traits. the identification and characterization of br genes in brachypodium along with the use of genetic engineering have the potential to enhance crop yield in important crops and even the use of fertilizers could be potentially reduced with less negative environmental effects.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated that the use of propiconazole in brachypodium mimic the dwarf phenotypes of br-deficient or –insensitive plants, thus pcz is a potent tool to study br responses in this model plant. we identified components of the br biosynthetic pathway dwf <dig>  cpd and br6ox <dig>  and bri <dig>  bin <dig>  bsu <dig> and bzr <dig> of the br signaling pathway in brachypodium. we showed that bddwf <dig>  bdcpd, and bdbr6ox are regulated by negative feedback loop at the transcript level and overexpression of bddwf <dig> in arabidopsis conferred transgenic plants with similar phenotypes to those overexpressing arabidopsis dwf <dig>  we concluded that bradi1g <dig>  bradi4g <dig>  and bradi1g <dig>  encode br biosynthetic genes with functions similar to their homologs in arabidopsis. heterologous expression of bradi2g <dig>  caused dwarf phenotypes in arabidopsis. we therefore conclude that bradi2g <dig> likely functions as br negative regulator in brachypodium. furthermore, the bradi2g <dig>  gene likely functions as a br receptor in brachypodium. however, the full-length coding sequence of bdbri <dig> was not able to rescue the dwarf phenotype of bri1- <dig>  which is a weak allele of bri <dig> in arabidopsis. this results indicate that bdbri <dig> and bri <dig> may not be functionally equivalent. further investigations are needed to verify the differences in the br biology of monocot and dicot plants.
