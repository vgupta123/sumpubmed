BACKGROUND
during the past few years, the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum has been developed into a powerful model organism suited for the study of short germ development, embryonic head and leg development, metamorphosis, cuticle metabolism, and other problems in insect biology. it is the first coleopteran species for which the genome sequence has become available  <cit> . in-depth functional analysis of molecularly identified genes is enabled by the availability of germline transformation  <cit>  and systemic rna interference that is splice-variant-specific  <cit>  and feasible at all life stages  <cit> . furthermore, several tools and techniques have been developed that facilitate insertional mutagenesis in tribolium castaneum  <cit> . although candidate gene approaches  via rna interference work very well in tribolium, they are biased towards previously recognized genes and mechanisms. in contrast, forward genetic approaches offer the opportunity to detect new gene functions not yet described in other model systems. small-scale chemical mutagenesis screens have been performed in tribolium  <cit> , but stock-keeping of unmarked recessive mutants is difficult due to the number of chromosomes  and the lack of balancers   <cit> . in contrast, insertional mutagenesis screens using dominantly-marked donor transposons facilitate both stock-keeping and gene identification.

several species-nonspecific transposons including hermes, minos, and piggybac have been shown to function in tribolium  <cit> . berghammer et al.  <cit>  introduced enhanced green fluorescent protein  under the control of the 3xp <dig> promoter as a universal, selectable marker for transgenic insects. this promoter is also responsive to nearby chromosomal enhancers  <cit> , allowing insertional mutagenesis to be combined with enhancer trapping  <cit> . in our scheme, insertional mutagenesis is based on the controlled remobilization of a non-autonomous donor element stably inserted in the genome. the transposase needed to remobilize the donor element is provided by a helper element . lorenzen et al.  <cit>  created several jumpstarter strains using a modified minos transposon to provide a source of piggybac transposase  <cit> .

here we report the first large-scale insertional mutagenesis screen conducted in an insect other than drosophila. we have identified many insertion lines that are either homozygous lethal, homozygous sterile and/or show enhancer-trap patterns at various developmental stages. the genomic locations, enhancer-trap patterns , recessive phenotypes, and genes affected by these transposon insertions are documented in the geku database  and insertion lines are available upon request .

our screening procedure should be applicable to many other insect species, because all genetic elements  used in this screen are species-nonspecific  <cit> . it also renders unnecessary the use of balancer chromosomes, which are not available for the vast majority of insect species. obvious limitations may be the ability to rear the insect species in the laboratory, the feasibility of germline transformation to obtain donor and helper strains, and the ability to perform single-pair matings with high efficiency.

RESULTS
test for lethality and sterility
following the procedure illustrated in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  new, independently derived insertions were isolated in the f <dig> generation and of these,  <dig>  new insertion lines were successfully tested for lethality/sterility.  <dig> potentially homozygous lethal lines were identified in the first round of f <dig> crosses, of which  <dig>  were confirmed to be homozygous lethal in the second round . a subset of the viable insertion lines, those producing fewer homozygotes than expected, was tested for semi-lethality. insertion lines were designated as potentially semi-lethal if homozygosity of a parent was indicated for no more than one single-pair mating in the first round of f <dig> crosses, or less than four single-pair matings after the second round. this was true for  <dig> insertions  after the first round, of which  <dig> remained in this category after the second round. hence,  <dig> %  of all insertions tested for semi-lethality met the criteria for semi-lethality. this somewhat relaxed scoring criterion reduced the likelihood of missing or overlooking lethal or semi-lethal mutations.

a total of  <dig>  lines were tested for potential lethality or sterility by a first round of single-pair matings . those that matched the criteria  were retested by a second round of additional single-pair matings in order to eliminate false positives . only those lines that matched the definition in the second round were considered to be lethal or sterile. all percentages are calculated based on the original total of  <dig>  lines.

*this number includes  <dig> lines that were considered potentially semi-lethal . because this was done only on a subset of  <dig>  lines, the numbers are not given separately.

potentially homozygous sterile insertions lines were identified by evaluating the single-pair matings: whenever two or more of the initial single-pair f <dig> self-crosses  failed to produce offspring , the line was classified as potentially sterile. this was the case for  <dig> insertions . we used either of two methods to confirm or refute a tentative diagnosis of recessive sterility. in the first method, we set up a second round of single-pair self-crosses bringing the total number of f <dig> crosses to  <dig>  the diagnosis was considered to be corroborated when the number of single-pair matings not producing any offspring increased to four or more. using this definition,  <dig> potentially sterile lines were reduced to  <dig>  however, further testing of these presumably sterile insertion lines showed that this criterion was not always reliable . in the second method we set up  <dig> male and  <dig> female outcrosses. the diagnosis of recessive sterility was considered to be corroborated if the crosses failed to reveal either a fertile, homozygous male or a fertile, homozygous female. out of  <dig> potentially sterile lines tested by the second method, only eight lines fulfilled this definition of sterility. since the second follow-up test appeared to be more rigorous than the first, we retested  <dig> of the  <dig> apparently sterile lines from the former test using the more rigorous criterion. all  <dig> lines proved to be fertile in both sexes. it seems to be clear that most sterile lines found by using the first criterion are false-positives. hence, we suggest using the stricter test for recessive sterility, which has the added benefit of identifying the affected sex.

detection of enhancer traps
3xp3-driven egfp expression is typically seen only in the eyes and central nervous system  <cit> . we analyzed all new insertion lines for additional, i.e. enhancer-dependent egfp expression, and detected novel patterns at all developmental stages. although we observed a bias for certain patterns , we identified  <dig> unique enhancer-trap patterns. the bias for certain patterns might be caused by a favored expression in certain tissues due to the paired-class homeodomain binding sites in the 3xp <dig> element of the transformation marker  <cit> . for a random subset of about  <dig> of all newly-identified insertions, we also dissected pupae and adults to look for egfp expression in internal organs that might not be visible without dissection. such expression patterns  were found only rarely. examples of enhancer-trap lines are shown in figure 2a-h. descriptions and/or photographs of all enhancer-trap lines together with information about their chromosomal locations  are available in geku-base .

analysis of lethal lines and developmental phenotypes
we analyzed the embryonic cuticle phenotypes of many lines identified as lethal and found a number of distinct cuticular abnormalities . for example, line g <dig> displays a phenotype similar to the proboscipedia ortholog maxillopedia in that maxillary  and labial  palps are transformed to legs ;  <cit> . indeed, this insertion is located in the first intron of maxillopedia. in addition, many lethal lines showed a high proportion of embryos that died prior to cuticularization, indicating early embryonic lethality.

to test whether the semi-lethal lines are false positives or true lethals with occasional escapers, we checked what portion of these lines  produce lethal l <dig> cuticle phenotypes  and compared it to the percentage of cuticle phenotypes produced by the other classes. a total of  <dig> %  of a random selection of lines complying with the strict definition of lethality showed such phenotypes. of lines with one or two single-pair matings  indicating homozygosity , this portion was  <dig> % in each case . lines with three single-pair matings indicating homozygous viability gave rise to cuticle phenotypes in only  <dig> % . thus analyzing semi-lethal lines led to the identification of additional cuticle phenotype-inducing mutations.

chromosomal location of new piggybac insertions
we determined the chromosomal location of  <dig> piggybac insertions by blast analysis of amplified flanking sequences against the tribolium genome . these insertions included lethal, semi-lethal and sterile as well as viable lines that showed an enhancer-trap pattern. the distribution of  <dig> homozygous lethal insertions on the linkage groups is shown in figure  <dig>  the lethal insertions appear to be distributed randomly among the linkage groups, showing a range from  <dig>  insertions per mb for linkage group  <dig> up to  <dig>  insertions per mb for linkage group  <dig> . superimposed on the generally random pattern of insertion site locations, there appear to be insertion hotspots and coldspots, the most evident example being the hotspot for local reinsertion near the donor site on linkage group  <dig> 

 <dig> insertions were localized in the genome sequence. of these,  <dig> were on unmapped scaffolds and  <dig> could be assigned to chromosomes, but not to the exact position. the distribution of the remaining  <dig> lethal insertions in the genome is shown in figure  <dig>

discussion
the geku insertional mutagenesis screen was designed to meet the following criteria: it should be rapid and simple ; and the analysis of the resulting insertion lines should be highly efficient .

large-scale insertional mutagenesis is feasible in a coleopteran species
based on a pilot screen published in lorenzen et al.  <cit>  we have performed the first high-efficiency, large-scale insertional mutagenesis screen in an insect species outside the genus drosophila, and we have established a crossing scheme that circumvents the need for balancer chromosomes or embryo injections. from our experience, we estimate that using the procedure presented here, one person should be able to establish  <dig> lethal strains per year. while the geku screen has identified many interesting enhancer traps and lethal phenotypes, genome-wide saturation would be difficult to achieve at the current level of efficiency. the most time-consuming step is setting up and evaluating  <dig> single-pair matings for each new insertion line to detect recessive lethality. for this reason we set up a small number of single-pair matings first, as most viable insertions can be identified by evaluating just a few crosses from each subset. however, also for insertions recognized as viable it was important to assess the fertility of all remaining single-pair matings in order to ensure that recessive sterile insertions were detected.

lethal insertions are readily detected while insertions causing sterility are difficult to detect
we found that lethal lines were readily detected by single-pair matings. based on the frequency with which semi-lethal lines produced strong l <dig> larval cuticle phenotypes, we suggest defining lines as potentially lethal when only one or two out of  <dig> single-pair matings indicate homozygosity. however, our definition of sterility proved to be too lax in the beginning, since most potentially sterile lines turned out to be false-positives in more detailed analysis.

comparing efficiencies with drosophila melanogaster insertional mutagenesis and enhancer-trap screens
the efficiency of generating lethal mutations by piggybac-based insertional mutagenesis in tribolium  is similar to equivalent screens in drosophila based either on piggybac  <cit>  or p elements  <cit> . whether the efficacy of such screens can potentially be doubled by the inclusion of splice acceptor sites or insulator sequences within the mutator element - as has been shown in drosophila  <cit>  - still has to be determined in tribolium.

the enhancer detection rate within this large-scale insertional mutagenesis screen was also  <dig> %. this is actually higher than in a comparable drosophila screen where enhancer detection without a suitable amplification system was about 2%  <cit> . only after including a gal4-based amplifier system could drosophila enhancer detection be raised to 50%  <cit> . however, such directed expression systems still need to be further developed and assayed in tribolium before they can be used in insertional mutagenesis screens.

correlation of phenotype  with insertion site proximity to protein coding sequences 
in 14% of all lethal insertions, piggybac had clearly jumped into the coding sequence of a gene. however, the majority of lethal insertions  were located in introns, apparently disrupting transcription or splicing of the affected gene. one possibility is that the sv <dig> utr in the transposon, which serves as a terminator of transcription in both directions, causes early transcriptional termination of the host gene. the tendency of piggybac to insert into intronic sequences had already been observed in drosophila insertional mutagenesis screens  <cit> .

ways to enhance overall efficiency
in the described scheme, when new crosses were set up, one had to switch between fluorescence  and normal light  several times, which was a time-consuming procedure. to improve this situation considerably, we constructed and are testing new donors that use rescue of eye color by vermilion+ as an indication of transformation  <cit> . the use of such a system will also facilitate stock-keeping.

another way to enhance efficiency in future screens might be the establishment of donors that include an artificial maternal-effect selfish element, e.g. medea . such elements induce the death of all offspring of a female  except for those that have inherited the element . for example, a modified piggybac donor element could incorporate a medea element in tandem with the 3xp3-egfp-marker. this modified donor element would be inserted at a chromosomal location tightly linked to an easily-scored recessive marker, such as the body-color mutation black  <cit> . in the p <dig> cross this donor strain  would be mated with a helper strain . the resulting p <dig> animals would carry one copy each of the helper, the donor and the mutant black allele. moreover, the latter two would be located in trans at similar positions on homologous chromosomes. such p <dig> hybrids would be mated with beetles that were trans-heterozygous for black and the medea-containing donor element, or, if the p <dig> hybrid is female, they could instead be mated to homozygous black  males. f <dig> offspring with black body-color then would arise only if they inherit the black chromosome from both parents. because the medea-tagged donor is arranged in trans with black, such black offspring do not carry a donor, and hence lack zygotic rescue activity of the medea element. this leads to their death by the maternal-lethal effect of the element. only if the donor has been remobilized to another genomic location can offspring carry both black alleles as well as the rescuing donor. hence, black body-color in the offspring indicates a remobilization event. this design would be an elegant means to enhance the detection of new insertion lines by obviating the need for fluorescence detection. it would also simplify the stock-keeping of lethal insertions, since a medea element tightly linked with the lethal insertion would constitute a type of balanced lethal.

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully established a method to conduct large-scale insertional mutagenesis screens in the beetle tribolium castaneum. using this method, we obtained several hundred lethal insertions as well as insertions producing enhancer-trap phenotypes. these lines have been made available to the research community.
