BACKGROUND
carotenoids are isoprenoids that are synthesized by all photosynthetic organisms as well as some non-photosynthetic bacteria and fungi. in plants, chloroplastic carotenoids are constituents of light-harvesting complexes and the photosynthetic reaction center, where they also play important roles in protecting tissues against photo-oxidative damage  <cit> . when accumulated in the chromoplasts of flowers and fruits, carotenoids act as visual attractants for pollinating insects and seed-dispersing animals  <cit> . furthermore, carotenoids are the precursors of important apocarotenoids, such as volatile flavor/aroma terpenes, and the growth regulators abscisic acid  and strigolactone  <cit> . recently, oxidized products from plant carotenoids have been implicated as signals induced by environmental stressors  <cit> . in addition to these biological functions, carotenoids serve as major micronutrients in the human diet  <cit> . in particular, β-carotene, α-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin are precursors for vitamin a biosynthesis  <cit> , while lutein and zeaxanthin slow aging-related damage to the retina  <cit> .

during the past two decades, the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants has been well elucidated  <cit> . previous studies have shown that there are at least three mechanisms that regulate carotenoid accumulation in the chromoplasts  <cit> . first, the transcript abundance of rate-limiting structural genes is predicted to be the primary mechanism controlling the carotenoid content and composition in the chromoplasts  <cit> . during tomato  fruit development, increasing expression of phytoene synthase  <dig>  and phytoene desaturase , diminishing expression of the chloroplast-related lycopene β-cyclase  and lycopene ε-cyclase , and low transcript levels of the chromoplast-specific lcy-b and β-ring hydroxylase  , lead to the accumulation of lycopene as the major carotenoid  <cit> .

second, carotenoid degradation by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  may be central to determining the final carotenoid concentrations in chromoplasts  <cit> . for example, despite active carotenoid biosynthesis in both the yellow and white petals of chrysanthemums , the carotenoids are degraded by cmccd4a into colorless compounds in the white petals  <cit> . in potatoes and peaches, the different carotenoid content among the cultivars can also be attributed to the distinct enzymatic activity of the ccd4-degrading carotenoids  <cit> .

finally, the sink capacity of carotenoid-accumulating tissues has recently been implicated in the control of carotenoid levels. the characterization of the orange  protein, which is involved in chromoplast biogenesis, revealed the importance of the carotenoid storage sink for carotenoid accumulation. due to a failure in chromoplast formation, the cauliflower  or mutant lacks carotenoid accumulation  <cit> . when the or gene was transformed into arabidopsis, the arabidopsis calli exhibited an orange color with chromoplast formation  <cit> . in tomatoes, the perturbed activity of several light-signal-related genes, including uv-damaged dna binding protein <dig>   <cit> , de-etiolated <dig>   <cit> , cullin <dig>   <cit> , hy <dig>  cop1like  <cit> , cryptochrome  <dig>   <cit> , golden 2-like   <cit>  and arabidopsis pseudo response regulator2-like   <cit> , caused changes in the plastid number and size, which indirectly affected the concentrations of the carotenoids and other phytonutrients in the ripening fruits  <cit> .

lycium barbarum l.  and l. ruthenicum murr. , which are two shrub plants belonging to the solanaceae family, have been used as traditional medicinal plants in china and other asian countries for centuries  <cit> . l. barbarum, in particular, has high economic significance in northwest china, with its red fruit  being used for both traditional chinese medicine  and nutritional purposes  <cit> . modern pharmacological studies have begun to investigate the biochemical mechanisms of the medicinal effects of wolfberry, including the antioxidant, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties, which are primarily attributed to the polysaccharides , flavonoids and carotenoids  <cit> . l. ruthenicum is another tcm used for the treatment of heart disease, abnormal menstruation and menopause  <cit> . the functional compounds in the black fruit  of l. ruthenicum are primarily comprised of anthocyanins, essential oils and polysaccharides  <cit> . as the primary pigment in rf, carotenoids have been extensively studied, and zeaxanthin and esterified zeaxanthin were reported to be the major bioactive compounds that accumulate in rf, especially for its traditional use in eyesight improvement  <cit> . however, the content and composition of the carotenoids in bf have not been comprehensively reported, and the mechanisms controlling the species differences in the carotenoid biosynthesis between rf and bf remain unknown. analyses of these differences may provide novel insights into the regulation of carotenoid accumulation in goji fruits, with important implications for their medicinal and nutritional value.

RESULTS
the carotenoid accumulation differs between the rf and bf from different lycium species
the analysis of the total carotenoid content in the red fruits of l. barbarum and the black fruits of l. barbarum at four developmental stages  revealed an increase in the carotenoid content of rf from s <dig> to s <dig>  reaching a maximum of  <dig>  μg g− <dig> fresh weight  . on the converse, the amount of carotenoids in bf declined from  <dig>  μg g− <dig> fw in the s <dig> fruit to undetectable levels in the s <dig> fruit .figure  <dig>

the carotenoid composition and content in ripe rf were previously reported  <cit> , with zeaxanthin accounting for the highest carotenoid proportion, followed by β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene, and with most of the xanthophylls esterified. in this study, to detect the carotenoid accumulation regardless of esterification, the carotenoid content in the four developmental stages  of rf and bf was analyzed after saponification. xanthophyll esters were undetectable in bf . in s <dig> of rf and bf, the chloroplastic carotenoids, violaxanthin, lutein and β-carotene comprised the majority of the carotenoids . two additional compounds  were detected in bf. as both the red and black fruits developed, the amount of chloroplastic carotenoids  declined . during bf ripening, no additional carotenoids showed rising levels, and all of the existing carotenoids gradually decreased to undetectable levels . meanwhile, in rf, several other carotenoids, especially zeaxanthin, increased dramatically from s <dig> to s <dig> . specifically, zeaxanthin reached  <dig>  μg g− <dig> fw, and β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene reached  <dig>  μg g− <dig> fw and  <dig>  μg g− <dig> fw, respectively .figure  <dig>

light microscopy of the green fruits  and ripe fruits 
the chromoplast differentiation in the fruits of the two lycium species was comparatively determined by examining the plastids in the mesocarp of the green fruits  and the ripe fruits  under a light microscope. the chloroplasts were observed in the green fruits of both species . however, orange, globular chromoplasts were only observed in the ripe rf of l. barbarum . consistent with the absence of carotenoid accumulation, a failure in chromoplast formation was observed in the ripe bf of l. ruthenicum .figure  <dig>

isolation of the carotenogenesis-related genes from l. barbarum and l. ruthenicum
to compare the gene sequences encoding the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis, degradation, and storage of carotenoids in both species, the full-length open reading frames  of twenty-five putative carotenogenesis-related genes were isolated . the phylogenetic relationship of each putative protein  was used to confirm the orthologous relationships of these proteins with the clearly defined proteins in tomatoes . two isoforms of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase , which are involved in the first step of the 2-c-methyl-derythritol4-phosphate  pathway, were isolated in each species. in particular, three pairs of carotenoid biosynthetic genes  were isolated; psy <dig>  cyc-b and crtr-b <dig> are putatively specific for carotenoid biosynthesis in chromoplasts  <cit> . the orf length of the majority of the genes  was identical between the two lycium species. the average identity of the protein sequences between l. barbarum and l. ruthenicum was  <dig> %, while l. barbarum and s. lycopersicum shared  <dig> % identity and l. ruthenicum and s. lycopersicum shared  <dig> % identity. consistent with other species, most of the proteins were predicted to localize to the chloroplast by protcomp .table  <dig>

the comparative rna-seq profile of the carotenogenesis-related genes in the ripening fruits of the two lycium species
to comparatively overview the expression of the carotenogenesis-related genes in both species, rna-seq data derived from the fruit’s s <dig> to s <dig> stages were profiled in this study. generally, the parameters, transcriptional read amounts and reads per kilobase of coding sequence per million reads  are used for assessing the gene expression levels when analyzing rna-seq data. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the rpkms of the  <dig> carotenogenesis-related genes were calculated. the rpkm of the chromoplast-related genes  in rf were much higher than those in bf, suggesting that these genes are more active in rf than in bf. particularly, the rpkm of chrc reached nearly  <dig>  in rf . in rf, the rpkms of some of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes  showed increasing trends during fruit ripening and approached the hundreds in s <dig> and s <dig> . in contrast, in all three bf stages, the rpkms of all of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes were less than fifty . during bf development, only the lrccd <dig> transcripts increased and sharply reached  <dig>  rpkm in s <dig> . however, the lbccd <dig> expression obviously declined from s <dig> to s <dig> . these results suggest that more carotenoids are degraded in bf than in rf.figure  <dig>

comparative analysis of the carotenogenesis-related gene expression in l. barbarum and l. ruthenicum fruits via qrt-pcr
to confirm the expression patterns of all  <dig> of the carotenogenesis-related genes during rf and bf ripening , qrt-pcr was used . consistent with the findings from the rna-seq data, the lrchrc transcripts were very low in bf, while the lbchrc transcripts were abundant in rf, particularly in the s <dig> and s <dig> stages. both or genes displayed constant expression during bf ripening, while the lbor <dig> transcript level was much higher  in rf s1-s <dig> than in s <dig>  the transcript abundance of hsp <dig> was increased by  <dig> -fold from s <dig> to s <dig> of rf, while it decreased to undetectable levels in s <dig> and s <dig> of bf.figure  <dig>

as the first enzyme in the mep pathway, dxs was shown to be a regulatory enzyme in tomato fruit carotenogenesis  <cit> . in lycium, dxs <dig> showed similar expression profiles in the two species examined here, with much higher mrna levels  in the leaves than in the fruit. specifically, the lrdxs <dig> transcripts were equally abundant in the leaves during s <dig> and s <dig>  before decreasing in s <dig> and s <dig>  while the lbdxs <dig> transcripts increased during the color-break stage  by 10-fold and gradually decreased thereafter . the transcripts of the putative chromoplast-specific genes  increased dramatically  during rf ripening, whereas they were consistently expressed at relatively low levels throughout bf ripening . similarly, the pds, zds, and crtiso transcript abundance was low during bf ripening but increased  at the color-break stage  in rf and remained high thereafter . the z-iso transcript was not detected in the leaves or fruits of either species via qrt-pcr. similarly, the lutein synthesis genes lcy-e, cyp97a <dig> and cyp97c <dig> were expressed at low levels or were undetectable in the leaves and fruits of both species . the zep and vde genes, which act downstream of zeaxanthin, showed similar expression profiles, with moderate transcript abundance in the leaves of both l. barbarum and l. ruthenicum, where they likely participate in the xanthophyll cycle. in the fruits however, both genes were consistently expressed during the ripening of bf but were barely detected in rf .

the transcript abundance of nced <dig> increased gradually throughout bf ripening, while in rf, it peaked at s <dig> and decreased thereafter . no nced <dig> transcripts were detected in the leaves or fruits of either species, except for extremely low levels in s <dig> and s <dig>  in rf, the expression profile of lbccd1a was similar to lbnced <dig>  while in bf, lrccd1a was anti-correlated with lbnced <dig>  lrccd <dig> was highly expressed in bf, particularly in the late developmental stages, while lbccd <dig> was expressed at relatively low levels in rf and gradually decreased throughout the ripening process .

functional analysis of the key carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes from l. barbarum and l. ruthenicum
to verify the functionality of the key carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes identified in the two lycium species, the bioactivities of psy <dig>  cyc-b and crtr-b <dig> were tested in e. coli. previous studies have demonstrated that these are rate-controlling enzymes in chromoplast-specific carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . the carotenoids in transformed e. coli cells were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography  . the positive controls  showed the expected absorbance spectra corresponding to phytoene, β-carotene and zeaxanthin. for the functional assays, the peaks of the carotenoids isolated from the bacteria containing the substrate synthesizing plasmids , coupled with the vectors containing the lycium enzymes, represented the peaks for phytoene, β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin. beta-cryptoxanthin is an intermediate for zeaxanthin, and therefore is an indicator of insufficient crtr-b <dig> hydroxylase activity e. coli   <cit> . overall, these results suggest similar psy <dig>  cyc-b and crtr-b <dig> bioactivities between l. barbarum and l. ruthenicum.figure  <dig>

discussion
the fruits of two valuable lycium species show opposite carotenoid accumulation patterns
the red pigmentation of the ripe l. barbarum fruit is due to the high accumulation of specific carotenoids  <cit> . unlike rf, the ripe fruit of l. ruthenicum is deep purple in color with a high petunidin content produced by the anthocyanin pathway  <cit> . to unravel the molecular regulatory basis for the differences in carotenoid accumulation between rf and bf, we first characterized the carotenoid compositional changes during fruit ripening in both species.

the phytochemical analysis revealed that the carotenoid accumulation increased during rf ripening . as shown in figure  <dig>  the zeaxanthin precursor β-cryptoxanthin accumulated at consistently low levels during the rf ripening process, which was accompanied by a high level of zeaxanthin accumulation, consistent with previous studies   <cit> . these results suggest that the flux through the carotenoid pathway in rf is primarily directed into the β, β-carotene branch to produce zeaxanthin. at the same time, the chloroplastic carotenoids lutein and violaxanthin, present in pre-ripe s <dig> green rf, gradually decreased during fruit development . beta-carotene is also a chloroplastic carotenoid, and it declined from s <dig> to s <dig> in rf; however, as another intermediate of zeaxanthin biosynthesis, it increased from s <dig> to s <dig>  consistent with the zeaxanthin accumulation .

in bf, the products of both the ε, β-carotene and β, β-carotene branches of the carotenoid pathway, namely lutein and violaxanthin, gradually decreased to undetectable levels during ripening . in contrast to the results for rf, the carotenoid compositions did not change during bf ripening, and the content of all of the existing compositions gradually declined to undetectable levels . it is interesting to reveal the mechanisms underlying the different carotenoid accumulation patterns between rf and bf.

the failure in chromoplast development results in no carotenoid accumulation in ripe bf
in fruits and flowers, a large abundance of carotenoids can be stored in the chromoplasts. following the research on the or gene, the formation of the chromoplast was recognized as a vital factor for carotenoid accumulation  <cit> . in the or cauliflower mutant, the failure in chromoplast formation blocked the biosynthesis and accumulation of carotenoids  <cit> . in transgenic or-overexpressing arabidopsis and rice, the chromoplast differentiation occurred in the calli of both species and induced the biosynthesis of the carotenoids  <cit> . in addition, chrc and hsp <dig> were also shown to play significant roles in chromoplast development and carotenoid storage  <cit> .

in this study, we observed that orange, globular chromoplasts existed in the cells of the ripe rf , consistent with the abundant carotenoid accumulation. likewise, consistent with the poor accumulation of carotenoids in bf, these organelles were not observed in the ripe bf . therefore, the development of the chromoplasts may be the primary cause of the differences in carotenoid accumulation between rf and bf. the expression profiles of the chromoplast-related genes  during rf and bf development also supported this speculation. or <dig>  chrc and hsp <dig> all showed much higher expression levels in rf compared to bf .

within the chromoplast, the carotenoids and the chrc protein are predominantly stored in lipoprotein fibrils  <cit> . distinct from the plastoglobules in the chloroplasts, these fibrils are characterized by a high homogeneity of apolar compounds, most of which are esterified xanthophylls  <cit> . in potato tubers, a positive correlation between the total carotenoid content and the esterified xanthophyll fraction was observed, suggesting that esterification facilitates the accumulation of these lipophilic compounds within the plastids  <cit> . recently, this viewpoint was also verified in apples   <cit> . the majority of the zeaxanthin that accumulates in the ripe, red fruits of l. barbarum is esterified to zeaxanthin-dipalmitate  <cit> . given the very high content of zeaxanthin in rf determined here, it is possible that, similar to potatoes and apples, the esterification of zeaxanthin may be a key regulatory step in carotenoid accumulation in l. barbarum fruit.

the species differences in the carotenoid accumulation are not due to differences in the functions of key enzymes
in addition to the chromoplast development, another explanation for the large species-specific differences in the total carotenoid content of lycium fruits could be altered by the functionality of the carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes. given that chloroplastic carotenoids are indispensable for plant survival and to investigate this possibility, we focused on key enzymes that may be not necessary for chloroplastic carotenoid biosynthesis. these are the chromoplast-specific psy <dig>  cyc-b and crtr-b <dig> enzymes. protein sequence comparisons revealed up to 97% identity between species, with no insertion/deletion or frame shift mutations indicative of non-functional proteins in l. ruthenicum . furthermore, the protein expression in e. coli revealed that all of the enzymes from both species were equally functional in catalyzing their respective carotenoid substrates . therefore, the low carotenoid content in the bf of l. ruthenicum is unlikely to be due to reduced activities of the carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes.

the biosynthesis of zeaxanthin in rf is regulated at the transcriptional level
increasing evidence suggests that the carotenoid content in the chromoplasts is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> . the ripening of the tomato fruit is one of the best studied systems for the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in the chromoplasts. changes in the production of carotenoids associated with tomato fruit ripening are mainly controlled via the transcriptional regulation of biosynthetic genes  <cit> . during rf, the zeaxanthin accumulation was significantly correlated with the upregulated expression of the upstream biosynthetic genes dxs <dig>  psy <dig>  pds, zds, crtiso, cyc-b, and crtr-b <dig> and the very low expression of the downstream gene zep . in tomatoes, dxs <dig> is ubiquitously expressed and shows the highest expression levels during fruit ripening, while the dxs <dig> transcripts are not detected in the fruit  <cit> . here, the dxs <dig> transcript was detected at very low levels in rf, whereas dxs <dig> was expressed more highly, especially in s <dig> . this difference between tomatoes and l. barbarum may indicate a functional divergence of paralogous genes in the different species  <cit> . during rf development, the upregulation of the chromoplast-specific genes lbpsy <dig>  lbcyc-b and lbcrtr-b <dig> indicated the presence of chromoplast-specific carotenoid biosynthesis in rf . the pds, zds and crtiso genes showed similar expression patterns during rf ripening, with a sharp increase from s <dig> to s <dig> that was maintained until s <dig> . therefore, it is possible that the transcription of these three genes is controlled by the same mechanism or regulatory factor. due to the failure in chromoplast formation during bf development, all of the abovementioned genes were expressed with generally lower levels in bf than those in rf .

lcy-e and two p <dig> family hydroxylases  are primarily involved in the biosynthesis of lutein  <cit> . the qrt-pcr results showed that these three genes exhibit a similar expression pattern in both lycium species, being highly expressed in the leaves and expressed at low levels in the fruit . this was consistent with the low or no lutein accumulation in rf and bf.

carotenoid degradation may continuously occur in the bf of l. ruthenicum
the relatively low transcript levels  of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes in all four bf stages  suggested that although the chromoplasts were not well formed in bf, the biosynthesis of the carotenoids still occurred to a small extent. however, the content of the carotenoids decreased to undetectable levels during bf ripening . therefore, we speculated that the carotenoid degradation occurred during the development of bf. in plants, the degradation of carotenoids is catalyzed by a family of ccds, which contribute to the overall control of the cellular carotenoid content  <cit> . arabidopsis has nine ccd family members, five of which have been classified as aba-related atnceds, and the remaining are atccd <dig>  atccd <dig>  atccd <dig> and atccd <dig>  <cit> . of these, ccd <dig> has been proven to play a decisive role in the regulation of the carotenoid content in some plant organs  <cit> , including chrysanthemum petals  <cit> , peach fruits  <cit>  and potato tubers  <cit> . interestingly, our results confirmed that lrccd <dig> was highly expressed during bf development . these results suggest that the low activity biosynthetic carotenoids were gradually degraded by the highly active lrccd <dig> during bf ripening, further resulting in almost undetectable carotenoid levels in the ripe bf. in contrast, the transcripts of lbccd <dig> showed a decreasing trend during rf ripening, and its expression level was much lower in rf than in bf . therefore, the lower rate of carotenoid degradation may be another factor for the increased carotenoid accumulation in rf compared to bf.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a regulatory model for the species-specific differences in carotenoid accumulation in l. barbarum and l. ruthenicum fruits has been proposed. the development of carotenoid sink organelles  is likely the primary cause of the differences in carotenoid accumulation between rf and bf. in rf, based on the formation of chromoplasts, a high flux towards zeaxanthin, which is regulated at the transcriptional level, combined with a low rate of carotenoid degradation concurrently determine the observed accumulation of high levels of zeaxanthin. in bf, where the chromoplasts are not formed, small amounts of carotenoids are biosynthesized, but they are mostly degraded by lrccd4; therefore, no carotenoids can be detected in ripe bf. the esterification of zeaxanthin in rf may be a possible regulatory step for carotenoid biosynthesis, which still requires further investigation. this study has improved our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling the levels of important medicinal and nutritional compounds in lycium.
