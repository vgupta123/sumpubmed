BACKGROUND
the collections of commensal microbes, called microbiota, are superior to their host in number as well as in genetic and metabolic diversity  <cit> . particularly the gut microflora, which comprises more than 90 % of all commensals, have profound effects on their host in the development and maintenance of body systems, including metabolism, immune regulation, or even neuronal function  <cit> . there are an increasing number of reports suggesting that a disruption in the normal composition of microbial communities can cause a wide array of health issues . these include obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease , autoimmune disease, colon cancer, or even depression and neurodevelopmental disorders . intriguingly, oral supplementation of selective bacteria to individuals suffering from health problems has shown to be effective in ameliorating the symptoms or curing the disease, in part by rebalancing the gut microbial composition  <cit> . as a result, these beneficial microbes  and their metabolites have come under great interest with respect to their therapeutic potential. accordingly, lactic acid bacteria , which have been widely used in food processing for a century, are now under re-evaluation in regard to their probiotic efficacy  <cit> .

in order for dietary probiotics to effectively function in the gut, they should meet certain basic qualifications . first, they must be able to withstand the challenging environment of gastric acids, digestive enzymes, or bile salts in the stomach and intestines. also, their intrinsic antimicrobial activities against pathogens would be beneficial to hosts. finally, it is desirable that they can adhere well enough to the mucosal layer in the gastrointestinal  tract, especially since they need to compete with other pathogens for nutrient uptake.

probiotics contain not only these general health advantages but also other far more diverse benefits. in particular, the involvement of gut microbes in the regulation of host immune function is extraordinarily comprehensive . many studies have used germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice to compare the susceptibility of developing immune disease with that of conventionally grown or non-treated mice, respectively. the current understanding of the roles of gut microbes in host immune regulation can be briefly summarized as follows. first, the gut flora contributes to the development of various lymphoid cells, including th <dig> cells, treg cells, iga-producing plasma cells, and innate lymphoid cells. second, it confers resistance against pathogenic bacteria or viruses by enhancing innate and adaptive immunities. third, the gut flora influences development of intestinal disease. for example, ibd can be stimulated by unprecedented overgrowth of pathogenic symbionts. in this case, the homeostasis between beneficial bacteria and pathogens are critical to minimize the inflammatory shift. finally, the gut flora has the capacity to affect even extra-intestinal diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, arthritis, type  <dig> diabetes, allergic inflammation, and cancers  <cit> . these systemic effects even extend to affect skin health, skin wound healing, eczema, and endocrine pathways predominantly via immune networks  <cit> .

local interactions between the gut microbiota and its host primarily involve the direct recognition of bacterial surface molecules by neighboring epithelial cells and immune cells in the intestine  <cit> . for example, lipopolysaccharide , peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acids, and exopolysaccharides of certain bacterial cell walls can induce a variety of gut immune responses. expression and modification of these compartments depend on bacterial genes and metabolic activities, which explains the strain-specificity. meanwhile, remote interactions can be initiated by secretion of various bacterial metabolic products  <cit> . for example, organic acids such as l-lactic acid  and short-chain fatty acids  , polyamines , small metabolites such as ai- <dig>  and histamine , or even proteins such as p40/p <dig>  were reported for their remote immunoregulatory roles .

as an effort to search for immunomodulatory microbes, in vitro tissue cultures using myeloid cells such as thp- <dig>  peripheral blood mononuclear cells , dendritic cells , or intestinal epithelial cells  have been widely employed  <cit> . common cytokines studied include tumor necrosis factor α , interleukins  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , all of which are known to induce many inflammatory responses, primarily pro-inflammatory. in contrast, transforming growth factor β  and il- <dig> are frequently assessed as anti-inflammatory markers. for example, culture supernatants from various lab were shown to contain metabolites that suppress the expression of tnf-α or enhance the expression of il- <dig> in various in vitro tissue culture systems  <cit> . also, direct treatment of immune cells with live bacteria resulted in the secretion of various cytokines  <cit> . these studies have established in vitro approaches to identify immunoregulatory microbes and metabolites  <cit> .

since these regulatory functions of lab are highly strain-specific, great potential for further characterization of lab remains. in this study, we established a protocol to isolate probiotic lab with potential immunoregulatory ability. we compared both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activities of each bacterial strain in vitro. finally, we applied the elected lab to a mouse model system to verify their relevance with respect to the in vitro screening.

RESULTS
characterization of probiotic lactic acid bacteria
we have been isolating lactic acid bacteria  for years from various sources including humans, animals, plants, and food products. these benebios microorganisms  collections are comprised of over  <dig> strains, with probiotic potentials revealed from their initial screenings. in this study, we chose four human commensal strains derived from fecal samples and further studied them in detail . those specifically examined were two lactobacillus reuteri strains , a l. gasseri strain , and a bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain .table  <dig> characterization of probiotic lactic acid bacteria

we examined the bacteria with respect to their general qualifications as probiotics . first, these bm strains showed resistance against acids  and bile salts , demonstrating a 43 % to  <dig>  % survival rate range after 1 h treatment at 37 °c, which are reasonably high scores  <cit> . next, we tested the antimicrobial activities against enteric bacteria. while l. gasseri bm <dig> showed a minimal inhibition of the tester strain e. coli, all others formed distinct inhibitory zones . these inhibitory effects are usually caused by bacteriocins, organic acids , hydrogen peroxide, or ethanol from the lab  <cit> . finally, we looked at their ability to bind to human intestinal epithelial cells  in vitro. for this purpose, we cultivated human colon cancer cells, ht- <dig>  on coverslips for 15 days and applied live lab cultures onto them for 1 h . after extensive washing, the remaining bacterial cells were visualized by gram staining for counting under the microscope  <cit> . the l. reuteri strains bm <dig> and bm <dig> showed high retention scores , while l. gasseri bm <dig> had moderate  and b. animalis subsp. lactis bm <dig> had low  scores. stronger adhesion of lab to iecs is particularly important since they need to stay at the gut mucosal layer long enough for the benefits to take effect on the host  <cit> . from these primary experiments, the two l. reuteri strains revealed higher potential as quality probiotics.

regulation of tnf-α production by lactic acid bacteria in vitro
we aimed to screen lab for their potential to suppress intestinal inflammation. to this end, we adapted an in vitro tissue culture system where the human myeloid cells  secrete tnf-α upon activation of their toll-like receptors  by bacterial lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . first, we verified that thp- <dig> cells of 5 ×  <dig> in 1 ml culture treated with lps at 150 ng/ml dosage for  <dig>  h usually resulted in a production of 200–300 pg/ml tnf-α . next, we collected the supernatants of bacterial cultures grown for 24 h, vacuum-dried them, and reconstituted the conditioned medium  . this cm contains complex activities to both suppress and induce tnf-α, depending on the lab and culture conditions  <cit> . indeed, we observed slight production of tnf-α by the cms from bm <dig> and bm <dig> without lps, but this amount was less than 20 % of lps-stimulated induction . finally, we added each cm up to 5 % of thp- <dig> culture  in the presence of lps . the tnf-α production with lps  was suppressed to 40 % with the cm from l. reuteri bm <dig> , and to 52 % with the cm from b. animalis subsp. lactis bm <dig> . for our screening purposes, we considered the suppression of tnf-α close to or less than 50 % of expression by lps treatment as anti-inflammatory. however, the cms from l. reuteri bm <dig> and l. gasseri bm <dig> were not able to suppress the tnf-α production to that point. we verified this inert activity by preparing these cms under various culture conditions .fig.  <dig> immunomodulation by lactic acid bacteria in vitro. a screening of lactic acid bacteria  with conditioned medium  for anti-inflammatory activities against lps-induced tnf-α production in thp- <dig>  without lps, a non-detectable amount of tnf-α was observed . with 150 ng/ml of lps treatment, thp- <dig> cells produced significant amounts of tnf-α . each cm was treated to 5 % of the thp- <dig> culture volume to assess its inhibitory effects . cm from control medium  was prepared and added in lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  * indicates p <  <dig>  from the t-test between the control  and either bm <dig> cm-treated  or bm <dig> cm-treated . bars show averages with standard deviation  from  <dig> independent assays. b screening of lab with live cells for pro-inflammatory activities to induce tnf-α production in thp- <dig> cells. about  <dig>  ×  <dig> bacterial cells from exponentially growing cultures were applied to 6 ×  <dig> thp- <dig> cells for 6 h. the cell-free supernatants were collected and assessed for the secreted tnf-α by elisa method. the results show averages with sd from  <dig> independent experiments. c summary of in vitro immunomodulation by various lactic acid bacteria



next, we examined the tnf-α induction capacity of the bacterial cells themselves because cellular components of the gram positive bacteria may induce inflammatory responses  <cit> . for this purpose, we grew bacteria to an exponential phase , then harvested, washed, and added these live bacterial cells in excess  to the thp- <dig> culture. metabolic activities of bacterial cells were kept minimized by antibiotics added in the thp- <dig> medium. after 6 h of incubation, the secreted tnf-α was quantitatively measured . even though all four lab cells were found to induce tnf-α, bm <dig> produced significantly smaller amount  than the others: bm <dig> , bm <dig> , and bm <dig> . during this 6-hr co-incubation, we observed that thp- <dig> cells experienced variable cell death depending on the lab used . most notably, bm <dig>  the lowest tnf-α inducer, caused the least amount of thp- <dig> death , while the other higher tnf-α inducing strains caused significantly more prominent death . therefore, it is not the case that bm <dig> induced low tnf-α due to the loss of thp- <dig> viability per se. for our screening purposes, we considered lab with active tnf-α production of more than 1000 pg/ml as pro-inflammatory.

in summary, the in vitro immunomodulation activities were assigned as anti-inflammatory with the suppressive cm  and pro-inflammatory with the inductive live cells . since bm <dig> showed both activities, we assigned it as possessing dual functionality . it was interesting to note that the two l. reuteri strains displayed distinct activities. from the initial screening of our wide range of bm collections, the anti-inflammatory strains proved to be rather rare, with a discovery rate of less than 5 % . also some strains showed neither activity, thus falling into the category of ‘neutral’ .

suppressive molecules in the cms are stable against heat and trypsin
since the cm from lab is composed of various bacterial metabolites as well as cellular components, we sought to better understand the anti-inflammatory nature of the cm. the expression of tnf-α quantitatively diminished with increasing concentrations of the cms from l. reuteri bm <dig>  and b. animalis subsp. lactis bm <dig> . interestingly, a smaller amount of cm from bm <dig>  actually induced tnf-α further, consistent with the observation that this cm contains tnf-α-inducing materials to some extent . nonetheless, the suppressive effects became dominant in the face of higher amounts of cm, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory materials are quantitatively additive and that the corresponding receptors on the thp- <dig> cell surface are abundant enough to readily respond to increasing cm treatment. overall, these observations suggest that the cms contain active metabolites responsible for tnf-α suppression, in spite of their complex nature.fig.  <dig> suppressive cms are quantitative and resistant against heat and enzymatic digestion. a cm from l. reuteri strain bm <dig> represses tnf-α production from lps-treated thp- <dig> cells in a quantitative manner. tnf-α levels produced from the thp- <dig> cultures with  or without  lps were measured by elisa method. for treatment of cm,  <dig>  % , 5 % , 10 % , or 15 %  of thp- <dig> culture volume  was added at the time of lps stimulation. cm from the control medium  was added to 5 % in lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  the data show averages with sd from  <dig> independent assays. b cm from b. animalis subsp. lactis strain bm <dig> contains metabolites that repress tnf-α production from lps-treated thp- <dig> cells in a quantitative manner. the lps and cm were treated as indicated. cm from the control medium  was added to 5 % in lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  data are from  <dig> independent experiments. c cms from bm <dig>  or bm <dig>  were either boiled  or treated with trypsin  to compare their activities with native cms . results are averages with sd from  <dig> independent experiments



we further examined the physicochemical characteristics of anti-inflammatory materials in the cms. boiling the cms from each strain for 10 min was found to be ineffective in altering their tnf-α inhibitory functions compared with native cms . likewise, trypsin treatment did not affect their activities . these observations suggest that the main inhibitory factors in these cms are neither proteins nor heat-sensitive molecules.

regulation of tnf-α in mice with probiotic bacteria
the ultimate question in regard to in vitro tnf-α regulation based on our lab screening was how relevant it would be with the in vivo applications. we directly sought to answer this question by applying the selected l. reuteri strains to a mouse model system. we prepared 20-week-old, inbred c57bl/ <dig> mice of  <dig> males and  <dig> females per group. then over a 20-week period, one group was treated with the anti-inflammatory bm <dig>  another group was treated with the pro-inflammatory bm <dig>  and the control group was treated with dextrose . as a means to minimize distress on the animals, the lab cultures were administered via drinking water to meet the daily consumption dosage of 1 ×  <dig> bacteria per mouse. we also provided a standard diet so that the aging process was natural during the period. at the end of the 20-week incubation , we euthanized the mice and withdrew blood for serum preparation to measure cytokines and testosterone using quantitative elisa methods. upon performing necropsy, we found no gross morphologic abnormalities.

we were primarily interested in the serum tnf-α levels from these mice. as shown in fig. 3a, control males showed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml of serum tnf-α. bm36301-treated males showed a slight reduction , though without meaningful significance . however, bm36304-treated males maintained significantly higher tnf-α levels . we also quantitated the female’s tnf-α concentrations . we found that the female control group retained higher tnf-α levels  than the male control group, though without significance . most notably, bm36301-fed females displayed significantly reduced amounts of tnf-α , while bm36304-treated females showed similar levels with the control mice . unlike these variations of tnf-α, we could not discern meaningful differences of serum il- <dig> levels between the groups .fig.  <dig> tnf-α from mice c57bl/ <dig> supplemented with probiotic bacteria. a the tnf-α of the serum from male mice  each fed with l. reuteri strain. ** indicates p =  <dig>  from the t-test in comparison with the control group . b the tnf-α of the serum from female mice  each fed with l. reuteri strain. * indicates p =  <dig>  from the t-test in comparison with the control group 



in summary, we observed a reduction of serum tnf-α with the anti-inflammatory bm <dig>  with a more pronounced effect observed in females. the pro-inflammatory bm <dig> led to an increase of tnf-α in males, but not in females. these findings suggest that our in vitro screening carries meaningful relevance with in vivo maintenance of tnf-α in these mouse trials.

l. reuteri bm <dig> maintained reduced body weight gain and high testosterone in male mice
aging is the source of many health issues in humans, including diabetes and obesity. in order to exacerbate such aging issues in the animal model, high fat diets are often employed  <cit> . however, the interpretation on those accelerated experiments can be complicated since no aging in humans should be driven by a purposed high fat diet. we cultivated all the mice with a standard diet so that their aging process could be most natural. in the 20-week experiment timespan starting from the age of 20 weeks old, control group males gained about 8 g weight  and control group females gained about 5 g weight . remarkably, it was noticeable that the weight gain in males fed with the anti-inflammatory bm <dig> was significantly lower than in the control  by 36 % . however, the weight gain of bm36304-treated males  was not significantly different from the control . the weight gains of the female groups were not statistically different from each other.fig.  <dig> aged male mice supplemented with l. reuteri strain bm <dig> maintain healthy body index. a net weight gain of mice c57bl/ <dig>  fed with each l. reuteri strain for 20 week period. * indicates p =  <dig>  from the t-test in comparison with the control group . b serum insulin concentration from mice fed with each l. reuteri strain as in . ** indicates p =  <dig>  from the t-test in comparison with the control group . c serum testosterone amount from male mice fed with each l. reuteri strain as in . *** indicates p =  <dig>  from the t-test in comparison with the control group 



another significant difference was the serum insulin level from bm36304-treated males . while the control male group showed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml of insulin, the bm36304-fed male group showed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml of insulin . however, consistent with the finding that the weight gain from this group was not much different from the control , we did not observe a more prominent abdominal fat accumulation in bm36304-treated males . at 40 weeks old, the insulin spike may not have caused clinically-evident diabetes in the mice, but the disease may have become more pronounced if the mice aged further. the insulin variation between the female groups was not significantly different from each other.

finally, we focused on the males’ testosterone levels. as shown in fig. 4c, the anti-inflammatory bm36301-fed males retained significantly higher levels of serum testosterone  than the control group . however, the bm36304-treated group was not statistically different  from the control. in order to further understand the testosterone results, we examined the testicles of each mouse. the weight of paired testes of the bm36301-fed males was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, 10 % heavier than that of the control’s . considering the smaller weight gain in the bm <dig> group , this size difference of the testes is more evident; the ratio of testes-weight to body-weight-gain  of the control was only 67 % of that of the bm <dig> group. however, we could not observe microscopic differences of the tissues from the testes, such as the diameter of seminiferous tubules between these two groups . we have not performed other studies such as comparing spermatogenesis or leydig cell area.

in summary, the anti-inflammatory bm <dig> helped males maintain lower weight gain with bigger testes and more testosterone as they aged. reduced testosterone production in aged males has been proposed to be related with age-dependent lesions in the testes, presumably as a result of inflammatory insult  <cit> . meanwhile, the pro-inflammatory bm <dig> triggered an increase of insulin, though without changes in weight gain or testosterone among males. notably, none of these bacterial strains had meaningful influences on these body measures in female mice.

healthy female skin from anti-inflammatory bm36301
one interesting feature of certain probiotics is that they can promote skin health in a manner dependent on immune regulation  <cit> . since the bm <dig> also showed anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo, we asked the question whether this strain can provoke such health benefits in skin. at the 18th week of treatment, we shaved an area on  <dig> mice from each group and examined them after 1 week. interestingly, bm36301-fed female mice exhibited faster hair re-growth, though not full recovery, at the shaved area . in contrast, control or bm <dig> groups did not display such a rapid pace of recovery. none of the treated males showed hair re-growth distinguishably faster than the control, indicating that this accelerated hair growth may be obvious in only females. another metric to evaluate skin health is by examining fur shininess. however, we did not observe meaningful differences between each group through sensory or light meter measurements, mainly due to the relatively shiny fur conditions of the controls .fig.  <dig> aged female mice supplemented with l. reuteri strain bm <dig> display healthy skins. a hair re-growth experiment on c57bl/ <dig> mice consuming l. reuteri strain-treated water or control water. a 2 × 2 cm wide area of skin was clearly shaved and the hair re-growth was examined a week later. b hair follicle  counts were collected from the skin section samples of mice fed with either control or l. reuteri strains. five microscopic images at 400× resolution from  <dig> to  <dig> mice were counted. * indicates p =  <dig>  from the t-test in comparison with the control group . c skin sections from control  and bm36301-treated  mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to show skin tissue layers and hfs as labeled. photos were taken at 100× resolution; the bar indicates of 100 μm in length for scale



we further assessed skin health by examining skin cross-sections under the microscope after staining with hematoxylin and eosin. as shown in fig. 5b and c, we found that the bm36301-treated female mice showed higher counts of subcutaneous hair follicle  than control female mice. the hf counts per microscopic view at 400× resolution were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the control female group, while the counts were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  from bm36301-fed females with a meaningful difference . however, bm36304-treated females presented only a slight change . upon a more detailed analysis of the hair follicles, we found that the bm36301-fed females displayed marginally more active hair cycle stages than the control . meanwhile, the hf counts from the male groups were not much different from each other . finally, we also assessed the skin thickness measured as the depth from the epidermis to panniculus carnosus . we could not find much difference of the depth between the control and the bm36301-treated females. however, the dermal layers of bm36301-fed mice proved marginally deeper than the controls’, and the adipose tissue from bm36301-treated mice was shallower than that that of the control. most of the subcutaneous hfs were found in the dermis.

overall, these observations suggest that the treatment with anti-inflammatory bm <dig> fostered healthier skin as evidenced by hair re-growth and hf counts in females. however, the microscopic differences of skin samples between the control and the bm <dig> groups appeared rather marginal. these skin health benefits were not observed in males. also, the pro-inflammatory bm <dig> did not cause any adverse effects on the skin at the time of experiments.

discussion
in this study, we have examined the health benefits of the l. reuteri bm <dig> strain. this strain met selection criteria for further in vitro and in vivo studies . from an anaerobic cultivation, this strain produced a culture supernatant containing various metabolites and cellular components, which could inhibit tnf-α production in the lps-activated thp- <dig> assay. furthermore, this strain minimally stimulated tnf-α expression in direct contact with the thp- <dig> cells, suggesting that it may be less inflammatory by itself in the gut . taken together, we postulated that bm <dig> is an anti-inflammatory probiotic. in order to evaluate the in vivo effects of the strain, we examined various body measures of the mice that had been fed with this strain in drinking water. during the natural aging process, the treatment with l. reuteri bm <dig> helped the male mice maintain reduced weight gain by 36 % less than the control mice . also, this l. reuteri treatment resulted in males with heavier testicles and significantly higher serum testosterone levels. bm36301-fed female mice were found to have significantly lower levels of serum tnf-α than the control . in addition, females consuming this strain displayed healthier skin with active folliculogenesis and faster hair growth .

identification of the anti-inflammatory metabolites from probiotic strains is being actively pursued due to their pharmaceutical effects. more recently, it was shown that histamine metabolically secreted into culture media from the human-commensal, l. reuteri atcc pta  <dig>  could effectively suppress a tlr pathway in vitro, which is involved in the tnf-α stimulation by lps  <cit> . this strain turned out to be an effective probiotic from in vivo trials with experimental models in regard to colitis, ibd, obesity, aging, and skin health  <cit> . in our study, the components responsible for tnf-α suppression from the bm <dig> in cm appeared to be heat-stable, non-protein molecules . it is of future interest to isolate these molecules and further analyze their biochemical properties. it would also be ultimately important to identify their biological activities related with the various health benefits we have discovered in this study.

unlike bm <dig>  another l. reuteri strain bm <dig> did not produce such an anti-inflammatory cm under our experimental conditions. instead, bm <dig> cells stimulated thp- <dig> to produce tnf-α in vitro , indicating an example of strain-specificity. however, this does not mean that bm <dig> is pro-inflammatory de facto, since it is not yet clearly understood how a strain can drive immune regulations into diverse directions. for example, the l. reuteri strain dsm  <dig>  which demonstrated pro-inflammatory effects in vitro, has been previously reported for its overall anti-inflammatory effects from in vivo animal models of necrotizing enterocolitis  <cit> . indeed, we have not examined the effects of bm <dig> on iecs, which are actual cells in the lumen surface. furthermore, we have not observed adverse clinical effects in mice treated with this bacteria. we may need to assess other indexes such as blood sugar or skin dermatitis scores from a bm36304-treated model for further clarification.

the probiotic benefits of bm <dig> manifested differently depending on the host gender. recent studies performed with male mice suggest that age-associated testicular atrophy is mostly due to the pro-inflammatory activation of the immune system, including th <dig> lymphocytes  <cit> . therefore, it seems likely that the anti-inflammatory network in the bm36301-fed males protected their testicle size and testosterone levels from atrophy as they aged, while the testes of untreated males displayed pro-inflammatory deterioration. since testosterone is important for the conservation of youthful, healthy bodies during the aging process, it can be explained such that the high testosterone levels in bm36301-fed males mediated the maintenance of muscle and weight control over time. in females, feeding bm <dig> lowered serum tnf-α significantly, a consequence which may be related with healthier skin  <cit> . it is not clear why bm <dig> conferred such gender-dependent benefits in these distinctive health categories, but gender is indeed known to have profound effects on skin health, immune system, and disease  <cit> . moreover, it has been reported frequently that host gender is a crucial determinant of probiotic effects. for example, an application of the l. reuteri atcc pta  <dig> on mice has elicited gender-dependent responses in tnf-α suppression and bone density  <cit> . more comprehensive studies with various other lactobacilli have also supported gender-dependent outcomes  <cit> . likewise, it is possible that bm <dig> affects male and female bona fide in different ways  <cit> .

it should also be noted, however, that some observations from the bm <dig> treatment were barely distinguishable from those of the control. for example, the diameter of seminiferous tubules in the control male testes was not significantly different from that of the treatment group. also, hairs of the control females were as shiny as those of the bm36301-fed females. likewise, skin depth measurements were not very different between the two groups. furthermore, we detected relatively high populations of active hair follicle stages  in the control. collectively, these dimensions suggest that the control mice were not experiencing serious health deteriorations at the time of observation. it is necessary to further compare any variations among the testes of male groups by examining microscopic details, such as leydig cells or spermatogenesis. as a comparison, erdman and her colleagues reported that the l. reuteri atcc pta  <dig> presented skin health benefits to both male and female mice, even though females showed more obvious fur luster than males. in notable contrast, they observed that the control mice displayed dull fur and skin dermatitis at the age of 40 weeks  <cit> . however, we did not observe such skin deterioration in our control groups. taken together, we speculate that only highly elevated measures  might have been scored with significant differences in our experiments. these gender-dependent effects of bm <dig> requires further studies with older mice.

an increasing number of reports claim that there are inflammation-mediated connections between gut microbes and disease . that tnf-α has been evidenced to be involved in numerous inflammatory diseases prompted us to choose the cytokine as a biomarker throughout the study  <cit> . however, the inflammatory network is very complex and many other measurements should be additionally included for a more comprehensive understanding. therefore, comparing the levels of a larger selection of cytokines together, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α, may provide further clarity upon host inflammatory status  <cit> . also, direct assessment of th <dig> cells and treg cells upon probiotic treatments may reveal a better inflammatory rank. finally, utilizing knockout mice of specific cytokines such as il- <dig> or il- <dig>  would clarify the roles of such intervening molecules in the mechanism of conveying those probiotic benefits from the gut to the immune network. because the pro-inflammatory th <dig> cells preferentially accumulate in the intestine, it has been postulated that the development of th <dig> cells is regulated mainly by gut microbes  <cit> . therefore, anti-inflammatory probiotics may present health benefits through il-10-dependent induction of the adaptive immune activities such as cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells, which in turn operate to downregulate il- <dig> production from th <dig> cells  <cit> . thus it is of relative interest to study how the probiotic bm <dig> can modulate these subsets of lymphocytes and cytokines in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we introduce a new human-derived strain, l. reuteri bm <dig>  which shows preliminary evidence for anti-inflammatory activities both in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro screening method to select bacteria by cm in combination with live cell treatments seems to be a valid starting point for further studies toward animal applications. current data suggest that bm <dig> may fall into a category of probiotics, which confers distinct health benefits to its host in a gender-dependent manner.
