BACKGROUND
reduced genotyping costs and the availability of the international hapmap project data  <cit>  have made genome-wide association studies possible  <cit> . multiple commercial snp panels have been made available for large-scale studies. as the snp selection strategies of these panels are different  <cit> , it is important to know how well they can capture common variations in the human genome. several studies have evaluated the "completeness" of these commercial panels on the hapmap population data  <cit> . the results of these studies indicate that most common snps are well captured, and despite substantial differences in marker selection strategies, the first-generation high-throughput platforms all offer similar levels of genome coverage  <cit> .

the completeness with which variation is captured must also be evaluated for different populations. unfortunately, the ethnicities of many patients sampled for complex disease gene identification projects will not be sufficiently reflected in the reference populations  selected by the international hapmap project. in addition, the number of genotyped individuals in hapmap populations is quite small, leading to under-representation of snps with lower allele frequencies. some commercial panels have been designed using the limited data from hapmap. in this study, we have evaluated the performance of these commercial panels on hapmap populations and on one non-hapmap sample containing a large number of estonian individuals. estonia is a northern european country that has been influenced by many waves of migration from europe and russia  <cit> .

several studies have already been performed to evaluate how well other caucasian population samples can be described by tagsnps calculated from hapmap ceph data  <cit> . the authors of one study found that in three out of four selected gene regions, the tagsnps of the ceph population worked well on other european populations   <cit> . another study found that 90–95% of estonian snps with maf > 5% have a r <dig> of at least  <dig>  with one of the ceph tagsnps  <cit> . in a third study, the authors suggest that ceph samples provide an adequate basis for tagsnp selection in finnish individuals  <cit> . the study by gonzalez-neira et al.  <cit>  indicates that tagsnps defined in europeans are also efficient for describing middle eastern and central/south asian populations. algorithms for tagging snps in multiple populations have been proposed by howie et al.  <cit> .

in view of this information, the aim of our study is to determine how well the recent commercial genome-wide genotyping arrays capture genetic variation in reference hapmap populations and in one non-hapmap population.

RESULTS
the number of snps in the regions studied
one of our main aims was to compare the tagging performances of different commercial platforms on a non-hapmap population, specifically an estonian population. as the estonian individuals were genotyped only in two genomic regions we had to limit the analysis to these regions. the estonian genotypes in our study originated from one gene-rich and one gene-poor encode region . in these regions, yoruban, asian and ceph population samples contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genotyped snp assays, respectively , in the final hapmap version  <dig>  the number of genotyped snps in the estonian population sample was  <dig> . these snps were randomly selected from the hapmap phase i dataset. among the ceph, asian and estonian population samples the percentage of markers passing validation criteria was similar , but it was higher in the yoruban population sample , possibly because of the higher allelic diversity in african populations. most of the snps that failed validation did so because of the low frequency of the minor allele .

the number of snps genotyped and the numbers of snps that passed validation criteria are shown. yri, ceu and asi  are, respectively, the yoruban, ceph and asian  population samples from the hapmap data for two encode regions of chromosome  <dig>  maf – minor allele frequency; mingeno – percentage of snps genotyped; hwcutoff – the p-value of the hypothesis that the current snp is not in the hardy-weinberg equilibrium.

evaluating the performance of commercial marker sets in capturing the genetic variation of hapmap population samples
after selecting and validating snps, we compared the performances of commercial panels in two selected regions with those shown in other publications  <cit> . the comparison also gave us information about the performance of humanhap  <dig> on hapmap populations that has not previously been published.

to evaluate performance of commercial panels, for each marker present in hapmap data we calculated the best tagging snp from each commercial panel. then  the percentage of snps covered with r <dig> ≥  <dig> , and  the mean r <dig> between each marker and their best tagging snp for the investigated population was calculated. this was done for all population samples with two minor allele frequency cut-offs . as shown in figure  <dig> a–b, all commercial whole-genome snp sets have poor coverage on the yoruban population, whereas coverage of the ceph and asian populations can reach 80–90% on humanhap  <dig>  in addition to coverage in two encode regions, the whole-genome coverage for commercial snp panels was also evaluated as in the study by barrett et al.  <dig>  <cit> . the previously unpublished humanhap  <dig> had the following whole-genome coverage estimations: ceu 86%, jtp + chb 83%, yri 48%. among the technologies analyzed in this paper, humanhap  <dig> had the best performance in all populations . the advantage over humanhap  <dig> is that humanhap  <dig> has increased coverage in non-european populations. for other platforms, we observed coverage values nearly identical to previously published results  despite some differences in data . the mean r <dig> of the whole genome is shown on table  <dig>  the mean r <dig> of two encode regions is shown in figure  <dig> c–d. in the table  <dig>  the r <dig> value expresses the mean r <dig> of all snps studied and additionally the r2of "covered" snps as in some previous studies  <cit> . here again, humanhap  <dig> shows higher values than other platforms, although the increase over humanhap  <dig> is not large on the ceph population.

evaluating the performance of commercial marker sets in capturing the genetic variation in estonian population samples
since fewer snps were genotyped in the estonian sample than in the hapmap populations, the mean r <dig> and coverage of the ceph, asian and yoruban population samples could not be compared directly with the estonian one. many tagsnps from the commercial panels were not genotyped in the estonian sample so their pairwise ld could not be calculated for the estonian markers. our solution was to reduce the marker counts in the ceph, asian and yoruban samples so that only the markers present in the estonian dataset were used for pairwise ld calculation. by this means we could calculate the relative performances of the commercial platforms on the reduced snp set . the calculation was carried out for the ceph, asian, yoruban and estonian population samples and the results were expressed as fractions of the coverage of the ceph sample . the results show that the commercial products cover the snps investigated with the same efficiency in the estonian, asian and ceph samples, but tagging performance was lower in the yoruban sample.

the fractions of universal and population-specific snps in commercial panels
it would be interesting to know how universal are the commercial panels for studying different populations. we counted the tagsnps used for describing only one population and those that could identify snps from multiple populations . for each snp in each population sample, the best-describing tagsnp from each of the commercial panels was identified. we then determined whether each commercial snp was the best describer of all snps in one, two or all three populations.

thus we were able to compare the universality of coverage of the different commercial platforms in different populations. we observed a strong bias towards ceph-specific markers in the humanhap  <dig> panel. this can easily be explained in terms of the snp selection strategy used: markers were picked according to the ceph hapmap population data using the r <dig> based method  <cit> , ensuring that the ceph population has best coverage and thus contains more ceph-specific snps. in contrast, genechip  <dig> k and genechip  <dig> k describe population-specific markers from all three populations fairly equally.

our results show that universal markers constitute 63–82% of all snps and these numbers are similar in all the commercial platforms studied. approximately 10% of the snps in commercial panels describe snps from only a single population sample.

discussion
in this study, two  <dig> kb encode regions  were used to find the efficiency with which a non-reference caucasian population can be tagged by commercial snp panels. as the whole-genome snp coverage and the coverage of these two encode regions are similar, we presume that these encode regions are representative samples of the human genome. estonian genotype data contain fewer commercial panel snps. thus, several commercial panel snps were not genotyped and the ld between them and estonian genotype data snp could not be calculated. the lower density of commercial panel snps might reduce both coverage and mean r <dig> values. to overcome the problem, similar hapmap reduced datasets were created and estonian set was compared as a ratio vs. the ceu population results in figure  <dig> 

the results of our analysis show that the non-reference caucasian population is tagged with the same efficiency as the ceph population from hapmap. all non-african populations show similar levels of coverage in all commercial panels, irrespective of the snp selection method for each platform. this is consistent with previous studies, which have shown that the ceph population data from hapmap samples can successfully be used to tag other european population samples  <cit> . other studies indicate that most of the common snps are captured by first-generation whole genome snp panels  <cit> . our study supports the combination of these results with another conclusion: commercial snp panels can capture most of the common snps from non-reference european population samples. the new illumina humanhap  <dig> describes common markers slightly better than the smaller humanhap  <dig> platform and reaches 86% coverage. unfortunately, the remaining 14% of markers that are covered by r <dig> <  <dig>  can be quite numerous. if we assume that we would like to cover circa  <dig>  million markers overall, 14% gives approximately one million poorly-covered markers. any of these could be the disease-causing snp that we are looking for in whole-genome association studies. our hope is that upcoming commercial platforms will be able to cover most of these currently uncovered snps by additional tagsnps.

in contrast to the results of previous studies  <cit> , we observed equal or slightly smaller coverage in asian and yri population samples for affymetrix  <dig> k than for illumina humanhap  <dig>  however, this lower coverage may be due to the random variation of genomic regions; we used two  <dig> kb regions from the whole human genome. some commercial panel snps can be used to tag markers from different populations. other markers, however, are only useful for describing markers from a single population. the information about the universality of tagsnps is important for planning association studies in non-hapmap populations. the markers that are able to tag different populations are expected to be useful in many populations. the fraction of universal markers  was found to be 72–82%.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that in a non-reference caucasian population, commercial snp panels offered similar levels of coverage to the hapmap ceph population sample. although the coverage of commercial snp panels has been evaluated for the hapmap ceph population sample in previous papers, our results indicate that it is also possible to use that information for other european populations. we present the performance calculations for humanhap  <dig>  which have not previously been published. the coverage of humanhap  <dig> reaches 90% of ceph markers and 45% of yoruban markers. we also present an analysis of the fraction of markers on commercial platforms that is universal and the fraction that is population-specific.
