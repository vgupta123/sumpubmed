BACKGROUND
comparative genomics led to the definition of  <dig> clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  by comparing protein sequences encoded in  completely sequenced genomes  <cit> . aimed at finding thermophile-specific proteins among bacteria, extended phylogenetic patterns searches based on the cog-database were performed. using this strategy, cog <dig> was detected as a cluster containing proteins from all thermophilic and hyperthermophilic but only one mesophilic organism  <cit> . surprisingly, although also absent from unicellular eukaryotes, cog1618-homologs are present in many higher multicellular organism such as homo sapiens, mus musculus, danio rerio, rattus norvegicus, etc. because of this unusual phylogenetic distribution, aathep <dig>  the gene product of aq_ <dig> from the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus, was characterised biochemically as the first member of cog <dig> proteins  <cit> . the analysis revealed that aathep <dig> is an ntpase catalyzing atp and gtp hydrolysis at turnover rates of  <dig> × 10- <dig> s-1and  <dig> × 10- <dig> s- <dig>  respectively, with a km in the micromolar range and a temperature optimum between  <dig> and 80°c. although cog <dig> proteins are annotated as "predicted nucleotide kinases"such an activity could not be confirmed for aathep <dig> experimentally and its in vivo function remains unknown. to further characterize the aathep <dig> function, we resolved its three dimensional structure by x-ray crystallography.

RESULTS
overall structure, domain class and architecture
selenomethionine substituted aathep <dig> was purified as described earlier  <cit>  and eluted as a monomer from the final gel filtration column. analysis of its nucleotide loading state using hplc revealed that it was partially loaded with adp . it was crystallized using peg <dig> as precipitant in the presence of kh2po <dig>  and crystals diffracted up to  <dig>  Å using synchrotron radiation . initial phases were obtained using a mad phasing protocol  and a model was build and refined. the final model has an rcryst of  <dig> % and an rfree of  <dig> % and contains one aathep <dig> molecule in the asymmetric unit.  <dig> amino acid residues,  <dig> water molecules, one phosphate, one magnesium and two sodium ions were included in the model. no electron density was found for residues d38-k <dig> which are part of a disordered loop.

aathep <dig> consists of a single compact domain confirming the gel filtration experiments as well as the resistance of aathep <dig> to limited proteolysis  <cit> . it is build up of nine strands and six helixes in the sequential order βαβββββαβααβαβα  which is in agreement with previously recorded cd-spectra showing an equal ratio of β-sheets and α-helices  <cit> . all nine strands form a single sheet in topological order  <dig> wherein a five-stranded parallel and a four-stranded antiparallel region can be distinguished . whereas the parallel part of the sheet almost lies in a plane, its antiparallel region is curved defining a convex  and a concave  side of the beta-structure . spatially restricted to the parallel region, two α-helixes are located outside of the sheet. in contrast, a set of four helixes is distributed over the whole bended sheet at its inner side. this set consists of three parallel large α-helixes in identical n- to c-orientation who are accompanied by a further perpendicularly arranged much smaller 3/10-helix located near their n-terminal sides. the edge of the antiparallel region of the sheet forms a small bended lid that covers this smaller 3/10-helix.

in summary, the overall topology of aathep <dig> is a central sheet with helical structures on each side. according to the cath protein structure classification  <cit> , aathep <dig> is assigned to class  <dig> . <dig>  i. e. "p-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases, homologous superfamilies with rossmann fold topology" which are mixed alpha-beta proteins with 3-layer sandwich architecture.

structural alignments and fold classification
for comparison with other structures in the pdb-database, the dali algorithm was employed  <cit> . the closest homologue of aathep <dig> was found to be cobalamin adenosyltransferase  that catalyzes the final step in the conversion of vitamin b to coenzyme b and has a reca-like protein fold. a comparison between the topologies of aathep <dig>  cobalamin adenosyltransferase and reca clearly shows the structural similarity  despite only 9% sequence identity in the aligned region. in contrast to cobalamin adenosyltransferase and reca, aathep <dig> contains an extension of its β-sheet consisting of strands β3-β <dig>  we conclude that the structure of aathep <dig> represents a variation of the reca protein fold.

topology of the p-loop
although being closest dali-homologue, the structure of cobalamin adenosyltransferase  differs significantly from aathep <dig> within the p-loop . whereas aathep <dig> bears a p-loop typical for p-loop hydrolases, the p-loop of coba is shorter by one amino acid which flattens its structure. this is an essential feature for the adenosyl transfer reaction  <cit> . thus, we do not expect aathep <dig> to catalyze an adenosyl transfer. a survey comparing sequences and structures of all p-loop-fold proteins led to the definition of two major divisions, the gk- and the asce-class of ntpases  <cit> . whereas the gk-class includes all gtpases and kinases, the asce-class includes all further ntpases. structurally, the gk-class enzymes contain adjacent p-loop and walker b strands. in contrast, as it is the case for both aathep <dig> and the reca superfamily, the asce-proteins contain an additional strand between and a catalytic essential glutamate  within the walker b motif, thus indicating that aathep <dig> neither belongs to the group of gtpases nor to the kinase family.

the catalytic centre
no electron density for an adp molecule was found indicating that only the nucleotide-free protein crystallized. however, we found electron density for a phosphate ion in the putative nucleotide binding site where the β-phosphate of the nucleotide is expected. this is a usual phenomenon, since negatively charged ions are often found in empty nucleotide binding sites .

in other atpases and gtpases, the aspartate residue of the consensus site dxxg  is involved in positioning a water-bridged magnesium ion presumably important for nucleotide hydrolysis  <cit> . in the nucleotide free aathep <dig>  there is also a magnesium ion at the corresponding position which is octahedrally coordinated to the hydroxyl group of t <dig> of the p-loop, a phosphate oxygen and four water molecules. one of these water molecules  makes a hydrogen bond to d <dig>  thus, the arrangement of the magnesium ion is similar as this found in the nucleotide-bound conformation of other atpases and gtpases.

to determine possible orientations of the nucleotide which was biochemically shown to undergo hydrolysis  <cit> , we constructed a superposition of aathep <dig> with ras complexed with gppnhp , and reca complexed with adp  by aligning the p-loop including the precedent β-strand for spatial orientation . we then analyzed the resulting position of the nucleotides  relative to the aathep <dig> surface . in both cases, the nucleotide would be located in a cleft of the aathep <dig> surface and would sterically not clash with residues of aathep <dig>  the position of the phosphates is rather similar whereas the orientation of the ribose and especially the position of the base is markedly different in the adp and gppnhp although the base would be close to conserved residues in both orientations. we cannot exactly envisage the base orientation of the nucleotide bound to aathep <dig>  but it is very likely that the overall orientation of the nucleotide and the position of the phosphates is correctly predicted. consequently, the large remaining cleft located adjacently to the predicted position of the γ-phosphate is unoccupied. the pocket itself is rather unpolar but it is lined by a highly conserved patch of basic residues  to which a negatively charged cosubstrate, e. g. dna/rna could bind.

the protein surface
the location of conserved residues in a protein structure often points to sites which are functionally important, e. g. the catalytic centre or conserved binding sites  <cit> . to detect putative binding sites of aathep <dig>  we colour coded the surface of aathep <dig> with respect to the conservation of exposed amino acids. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  there is only one highly conserved region located in and around a cleft of the protein surface which includes the walker a motif . we conclude that this particular region represents the functionally most important site, i. e. the nucleotide and cosubstrate binding site of aathep <dig>  not even a single amino acid residue conserved in all species aligned in figure  <dig> can be detected on the residual protein surface of aathep <dig>  for that reason, we conclude that binding of the physiological cosubstrate is restricted to the neighbourhood of the nucleotide binding pocket.

analysis of the electrostatic surface potential of aathep <dig> strikingly revealed a number of positively charged clusters, whereas almost no negatively charged regions can be found . this is in agreement with the strong binding of aathep <dig> to cation exchangers and its theoretical pi of  <dig> . the largest positively charged spot is located in a conserved region close to the nucleotide binding cleft. based on this observation and the similarity to the reca protein we speculate that aathep <dig> may be a dna or rna modifying enzyme. gene functions can be predicted by searching for the conservation of operons and gene orders because genes found in gene strings, particularly in multiple genomes, can be assumed to be functionally linked  <cit> . for thep <dig>  we detected  <dig> genomes  where the thep1-gene is immediately followed by a cog <dig> protein on the same strand. in pyrococcus furiosus, this protein is characterized as a n <dig>  n2-dimethylguanosine trna methyltransferase  <cit> . thus, aathep <dig> may also play a role in trna modification. furthermore, both cog <dig> proteins and thep <dig> proteins can be considered to belong to the group of pace-proteins   <cit> . pace proteins are described being involved in fundamental cellular functions and several of them are obviously related to rna metabolism  <cit> .

the human homologue
the human homologue mgc <dig>  shows 39% sequence identity to aathep <dig>  and was first described in a study aiming at identifying full-length orf for all human and mouse genes <cit> . no function is yet described for this protein. however, gene profiling data from unigene are available  <cit> . hsthep <dig> is widely expressed in most of the examined tissues including brain, heart, lymph node, skin and pancreas whereas no expression was found in blood, thymus, bladder and spleen. it is especially highly expressed in embryonic and various tumour tissues. from these data we conclude that hsthep <dig> has a general function in many human tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
the crystal structure of aathep <dig> uncovered a modified reca-like fold. although the function of aathep <dig> remains unclear, the structure led us to conclude that the enzyme does not belong to the group of gtpase, kinases or adenosyltransferases. analysis of the electrostatic surface potential revealed several positively charged clusters indicating the presence of putative nucleic acid binding sites. since aathep <dig> has homologues in thermophilic bacteria and vertebrates it can serve as a model for the complete cog <dig> protein family.
