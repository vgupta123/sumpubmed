BACKGROUND
phosphatase of regenerating liver  family is classified as class iva of protein tyrosine phosphatase  that removes phosphate groups from phosphorylated tyrosine residues on proteins. mammalian prl family consists of three prl members. prl- <dig>  was originally identified as an immediate-early growth response gene in the nucleus of regenerating rat liver and mitogen-treated 3t <dig> mouse fibroblasts  <cit> . prl- <dig>  and prl- <dig>  were subsequently discovered through database searches for sequences homologous to prl- <dig>  <cit> .

overexpression of prl family members has been implicated in cancer progression. for example, prl- <dig> up-regulation clearly correlates with colon carcinoma metastases, gastric carcinoma with nodal metastasis, ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and liver carcinoma cells . notably, prl- <dig> expression level in primary colorectal cancers has prognostic significance in predicting the development of liver and lung metastases  <cit> . prl- <dig> has been found to elevate in renal carcinoma, melanoma, pancreatic cancer cells, and ovarian lymphoma cells  <cit> . in addition to prl- <dig> and prl- <dig>  prl- <dig> overexpression is associated with prostate malignancies  <cit>  and breast cancer  <cit> . these observations indicate that prl family proteins play important roles in metastasis and a variety of cancers  <cit> .

although the prl family members are known to be involved in cancer progression and metastasis, the understanding of normal prl expression patterns during embryonic development is limited. most of previous studies were focused on examining prl expression in adult tissues. for example, rat prl- <dig> is mainly expressed in brain, skeletal muscle  <cit> , and a number of digestive epithelial tissues  <cit> . rat prl- <dig> mrna is widely expressed in adult tissues including the anterior pituitary, brain cortex, adrenal gland, kidney, testis, and heart  <cit> . rat prl- <dig> protein has not yet been examined in adult normal tissues but is found to be expressed in fetal heart  <cit> . in mouse, prl- <dig> mrna is expressed at all stages examined from e <dig>  through e <dig>  in a variety of tissues except heart and skeletal muscle  <cit> . in contrast, mouse prl- <dig> mrna is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle and prl- <dig> mrna is mainly expressed both in the skeletal muscle and heart  <cit> . in addition, mouse prl- <dig> is also expressed in villus epithelial cells of the small intestine  <cit> . similar to mouse prl- <dig>  human prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> are almost ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues, except that prl- <dig> is absent in the brain cortex  <cit> . in contrast to the ubiquitous expression pattern, human prl- <dig> mrna is most enriched in the heart and skeletal muscle and moderately expressed in the pancreas  <cit> . these observations indicate that the expressions of prl members can be varied in a tissue specific manner in mammals.

to our knowledge, no study has yet described and compared the expression patterns of prls in drosophila and zebrafish model animals during embryonic development. here, we demonstrated and characterized, for the first time, the comprehensive expression pattern of both drosophila prl and zebrafish prls during embryonic development by either whole mount immunostaining or in situ hybridization. to further understand the evolution of prl gene in the chordate lineage, we also identify the single prl orthologue in the basal chordate amphioxus and study its embryonic expression. our study reveals evolutionary conserved as well as lineage specific prl expression patterns during embryonic development among drosophila, amphioxus, and lower vertebrate zebrafish.

RESULTS
drosophila, amphioxus, and zebrafish prl phosphatases are highly conserved
prl phosphatases from selected species and their molecular features are summarized in table  <dig>  all of these prl phosphatases possess alkaline isoelectric points  and are proposed to be positively charged at physiological ph. in vertebrates, prl family contains three prl phosphatases whereas there is only one prl gene in protostomes including c. elegans and drosophila, and in invertebrate deuterostomes including sea urchin and amphioxus . among vertebrates, prl homologs including human, mouse, and zebrafish share more than 80% amino acid sequence identity. for instance, zebrafish prl- <dig>  prl- <dig>  and prl- <dig> share 92%, 82%, and 88% identities with their human orthologs, respectively. although a little bit lower, the protostome and invertebrate deuterostome prls also share significant amino acid sequence identity and similarity with their vertebrate orthologs. for instance, drosophila prl shares 75% similarity and 58% identity with human prl- <dig> and 74% similarity and 57% identity with zebrafish prl- <dig> 

to get an idea about the evolutionary relationships of prl phosphatases among species, we performed phylogenetic analysis. by using neighbor-joining  method  <cit>  with p-distance model that conducted in mega <dig>  <cit> , vertebrate prl phosphatases were grouped as a robust clade with 100% bootstrap support . this phylogenetic tree demonstrated that vertebrate prls originated through gene duplication. besides, prl- <dig> phosphatase is classified as a more distinct group from both prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> phosphatases. interestingly, the basal chordate branchiostoma floridae contains only one prl phosphatase gene in its genome , but we identified three cdna isoforms from our cdna/est database. when we aligned these three prl isoforms to the assembled draft genome sequence, we found they differ in their exon usage for the 5’ and 3’ utr region, whereas the exon regions for the protein coding sequence are the same and thus encode an identical protein sequence consisting  <dig> amino acids . the single b. floridae prl sequence branches out at the base of all vertebrate prls, suggesting that the duplication events generating prl- <dig>  prl- <dig>  and prl- <dig> occurred during early vertebrate evolution.

previous studies indicate that prl phosphatases contain conserved wpd loop and c5r catalytic motif required for its phosphatase enzymatic activity  <cit> . in addition, the c-terminal region consists of a polybasic region together with a c-terminal prenylation motif which are required for its association with plasma membrane and early endosome  <cit> . the multiple sequence alignment reveals that drosophila, amphioxus and zebrafish prls also contain these highly conserved signatures .

drosophila prl is expressed in developing mid-gut and cns in embryogenesis and localized on the plasma membrane
to analyze the expression pattern of drosophila prl  in embryogenesis, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization. at embryonic stage  <dig>  dmprl is ubiquitously expressed throughout the embryos . in stage  <dig> embryos, dmprl is expressed at developing anterior mid-gut and posterior mid-gut . at stage  <dig>  dmprl expression is sustained in developing anterior mid-gut and posterior mid-gut . in addition, the expression of dmprl in ventral nerve cord  can also be observed at stage  <dig> embryos . in stage  <dig> embryos, dmprl was expressed in a significant amount in procephalon .

to analyze the expression pattern and subcelluar localization of drosophila prl protein, we generated an anti-dmprl antibody. the full length dmprl cds with  <dig> codons was subcloned into pet-32a vector for producing recombinant dmprl proteins which were used to generate dmprl antiserum from rabbits. the dmprl antiserum preferentially recognized a protein band that represents dmprl in embryo lysates around  <dig> kda on western blots . the antibody specificity of dmprl antiserum was further proved by its recognition of gfp-prl fusion proteins in ovary lysate . to explore the embryonic expression of dmprl protein, we preformed whole mount immunostaining. at embryonic stage  <dig>  dmprl is mainly localized in the apical membrane of blastoderm embryos . in stage  <dig> embryos, dmprl is ubiquitously expressed in the germ band and evenly distributed in the plasma membrane of the cells . at stage  <dig>  the dmprl expression is enriched in vnc . in addition, dmprl expression can be detected in the developing anterior and posterior mid-guts . in stage  <dig> embryos, dmprl expression persisted in the vnc  but the mid-gut expression of dmprl had vanished . to confirm the expression of dmprl in vnc, we dissected vnc of stage  <dig> embryos and performed double immunostaining with anti-dmprl and anti-bp <dig>  an axonal marker, antibodies. the dmprl signal colocalized with bp <dig> staining perfectly , indicating dmprl expression is indeed in vnc. in summary, our data suggest that dmprl begins to enrich in the axon of vnc by embryonic stage  <dig> 

previous study indicates that prl phosphatases contain a c-terminal caax prenylation motif which is required for its association with plasma membrane  <cit> . to further confirm whether dmprl is localized on the plasma membrane as its human homologs  <cit> , we examined the expression of dmprl on eye imaginal disc. in drosophila eye disc, dmprl is more prominent in differentiating disc cells  and colocalized with phalloidin  that marks filamentous actin. this result indicates that dmprl is associated with plasma membrane as its human homologs. in addition, we noticed an enrichment of dmprl signal in the optic stalk which consisting of photoreceptor axons . as the larval eye disc will develop into the future retina, we next examined developing pupal retinas. similar to larval eye disc, dmprl signal is highly enriched in the developing axons of pupal eye disc at 25% pupal development . further, we also observed that dmprl can be clearly detected in the plasma membrane of pupal retina at 50% pupal development . to examine whether imaginal discs other than eye disc can express dmprl, we stained wing and leg imaginal discs. in wing discs, dmprl was ubiquitously expressed  and colocalized with phalloidin . in leg discs, we also observed the ubiquitous expression of dmprl  and its colocalized with phalloidin . in conclusion, dmprl is a membrane associated protein and its expression is enriched in developing mid-guts and vnc in embryogenesis.

zebrafish prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> are mainly expressed in neuronal cell lineages
to determine the spatiotemporal expression patterns of prl- <dig>  prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> during early development of zebrafish, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization using antisense dig-labeled riboprobes. zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts were first detected from 1~4-cell stages to cleavage period , and extended their expression from the gastrula period to the early segmentation stages . at 24-hpf, the zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts were restricted to the head region . flat-mount of 24-hpf embryos revealed that prl- <dig> signals distributed in the entire brain, including the diencephalon, midbrain, and rhombomeres 1- <dig> . by 36- , 48-  and 72-hpf , zebrafish prl- <dig> expressed strongly in brain, eyes as well as in pharyngeal arches . cryosections of 72-hpf embryo revealed zebrafish prl- <dig> signals were detected at tectum, iris, retinal pigment epithelium, outer plexiform layer, inner plexiform layer, optic fiber layer . however, the expression zebrafish prl- <dig> was relatively weak in somite  and gut . these results suggest that the expressions of zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts are most abundant at neuronal lineages.

zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts were first observed from 1~4-cell stages to cleavage period, and their expression extended from the gastrula period to the early segmentation stages . by 24-hpf, the zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts were detected in head region as well as in trunk . by 36- , 48-  and 72-hpf , zebrafish prl- <dig> expressed strongly in brain, eyes, fin buds as well as in pharyngeal arches . cryosections of 72-hpf embryo revealed prl- <dig> signals at outer layer of lens , anterior somites , and gut , but were undetectable at retinal pigment epithelium, inner plexiform layer, optic fiber layer . on the basis of these observations, we conclude that the neuronal expressions of zebrafish prl- <dig> are similar to that of zebrafish prl- <dig>  except that zebrafish prl- <dig> displays stronger signals in eye regions. in contrast to zebrafish prl- <dig>  zebrafish prl- <dig> is strongly expressed in gut.

zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts are expressed in brain, somites, blood island, and head muscles in developing embryos
zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts were first observed at 1-cell stage . at gastrula stage, prl- <dig> signals distributed in germ ring and in embryonic shield  . by 12-hpf, the zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts were down-regulated suggesting that maternal inherited prl- <dig> might be exhausted . at 24-hpf , 30-hpf , and 36-hpf , the zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts were detected at head region. cryosections of 36-hpf embryo reveals the expression of zebrafish prl- <dig> transcripts in brain region of mesencephalon and telencephalon  and somites . afterward, prl- <dig> signals at head region persisted while its expression in somite diminished . it is interesting to note that zebrafish prl- <dig> was transiently expressed at blood island  at  <dig> hpf , suggesting that prl- <dig> might play a role on blood cell maturation. by 72-hpf, zebrafish prl- <dig> signals were expressed at a small subset of head muscles including dorsal pharyngeal wall 1- <dig> , medial rectus , sternohyoideus . in addition, zebrafish prl- <dig> signals can be observed in retina , fin , and olfactory placode .

amphioxus prl is initially expressed throughout the embryo but later concentrated to the anterior neural tube in the larva
to understand the evolution of prl developmental expression patterns, we analyzed prl gene expression in basal chordate amphioxus by whole mount in situ hybridization. at blastula stage, weak amphioxus prl expression was detected throughout the entire embryo , and this ubiquitous expression continued to gastrula stage . at neurula stages, amphioxus prl transcripts were still detected throughout the embryo, but we noticed that the signals appeared to be stronger in the dorsal side of the embryos . during the early larval stage, we found amphioxus prl transcripts were more concentrated in the anterior neural tube at the cerebral vesicle of amphioxus , although some weak signals were still detectable throughout the body.

discussion
prl is an evolutionary conserved protein family that is widely distributed in many species among the protostomes and deuterostomes. through database search, it is evident that all of the examined vertebrate genomes possess three prl genes, whereas invertebrate animals including c. elegans, drosophila, sea urchin, and the basal chordate amphioxus branchiostoma floridae have only one prl gene. our molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three vertebrate prl genes may be the product of gene duplication events that happened at the base of the vertebrate lineage. by comparing whole-genome synteny patterns, it has been shown that the vertebrate genome had undergone two rounds of whole-genome duplication during early vertebrate evolution  <cit> . we analyzed the synteny patterns between amphioxus and human genomic regions around prl genes and found that the single amphioxus prl gene is located on the branchiostoma floridae genomic scaffold  <dig> , while the three human prl paralogues are located on three different chromosomes. we identified some conserved synteny patterns among amphioxus prl and human prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> ; however, no synteny conservation could be identified around the genomic region harboring prl- <dig> on human chromosome  <dig>  which may be due to genomic rearrangement after duplication. in fact, we also detected extensive genomic rearrangements that may have caused translocation  and tandem duplication of genes  around the vertebrate prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> genomic regions , suggesting that after two rounds of whole-genome duplication, vertebrate genomes have experienced extensive rearrangements during evolution.

in mammals, some of the expression profiles of prl phosphatase have been characterized at either the protein and/or mrna levels in normal tissues . however, embryonic expression patterns of prl orthologs have not yet been characterized in teleosts and invertebrates. in this study, we characterized all of the three zebrafish prl genes, drosophilia prl, as well as amphioxus prl, and examined their embryonic expression patterns. in vertebrates including zebrafish, rat, mouse, and human, most of prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> are found to be expressed in the neuronal cell lineage . with regard to drosophila prl, it was detected strongly in the ventral nerve cord during embryogenesis , and the expression of amphioxus prl gene is also detected in the anterior central nervous system . these results suggest that the biological role of “prototypic prl” might be involved in the nervous system development.

in contrast to general neuronal expression of prl- <dig>  prl- <dig>  the expression of mammalian and zebrafish prl- <dig> phosphatases are preferential in mesodermal cell lineage, such as heart, skeletal muscle, and pre-erythrocytes . thus, we propose that the ancestral prl is predominantly expressed in neuronal cell lineage, especially in the central nervous system. in the vertebrate lineage, two of the duplicated prl paralogues, prl- <dig> and prl- <dig>  retained this neuronal expression, while the third paralogue, prl- <dig>  may have evolved new function and obtained more specific expression in the mesodermal cell lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study characterizes the distinct expression patterns of three structurally related zebrafish prl genes and those of drosophila and amphioxus prl homologues. our comparisons provide interesting insight into the evolution of prl genes and their embryonic expression patterns, and highlight the possible consequence of gene duplication events on the neofunctionalization of duplicated genes during vertebrate evolution.
