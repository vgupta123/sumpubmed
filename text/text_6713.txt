BACKGROUND
the maturation of auditory processing abilities shows a protracted developmental time course, with many specific processes not reaching adult levels until adolescence. this prolonged maturation has been shown with behavioral measures of performance on auditory tasks and by analysis of the electrical activity of the brain's response to auditorily presented information  <cit> . auditory temporal processing has been a focus of particular interest because it appears important for language and literacy acquisition  <cit> . behaviorally, temporal acuity has often been assessed using gap detection tasks, where participants are required to respond to brief gaps of varying duration embedded in the signal. several studies have shown improvements in gap detection with age, but there are marked differences in the estimates of the gap detection thresholds and the sensitivity of the tasks to development, depending on the characteristics of the signal in which the gaps are embedded  <cit> . when the gap is embedded between  <dig> ms tone pips of identical frequencies, young children are able to detect gaps at thresholds of  <dig>  ms  <cit> , whereas higher thresholds are reported when the gaps are embedded in tones of differing frequencies  <cit> . other tasks assessing auditory temporal processing, such as detection of frequency modulation and sensitivity to backward masking, show a protracted developmental course, with school-aged children performing below adult levels  <cit> .

the study of auditory maturation using erps is complicated by the fact that there are marked age effects on the morphology, amplitudes, and latencies of the obligatory sensory components elicited by auditory stimuli. in children younger than  <dig> years of age, the auditory evoked response to clicks or tones is dominated by a positive peak at a latency of approximately  <dig> ms . at approximately  <dig> years of age, the first negative deflection  becomes apparent in the erp and there is a corresponding decrease in p <dig> latency and amplitude  <cit> . ponton et al.  <cit>  argued, based on the developmental trajectories of the amplitudes, latencies, and dipole sources identified for these two peaks, that the modulation of the erp waveform morphology reflected the superimposition of a developing n <dig> source generated in superficial cortical layers of the supratemporal gyrus.

when two auditory stimuli are presented in succession, there are three potential effects we might expect to see in the erp: summation of responses, attenuation of the response to the second stimulus, or enhancement of the response to the second stimulus. the simplest situation is where identical erps are elicited to each stimulus, and these summate. in such a case there is no influence of one evoked response on the other, but the resulting waveform may look very different to that for a single tone if the time interval is short, so that the response to the second stimulus begins before the response to the first stimulus is complete. if the response to the paired-tone sequence was the result of simple summation, alignment and subtraction of the response to the single stimulus from the waveform elicited by the paired-stimulus waveform would result in an identical response to that seen to stimulus one alone.

a second possibility is that the response to the second stimulus in a pair or sequence may be attenuated relative to the first stimulus. such attenuation has been described for responses to auditory stimulus sequences, but there is debate as to the underlying mechanism. one proposition is that attenuation is the consequence of neural refractoriness, a phenomenon well-understood at the level of individual neurons, which show reduced sensitivity to incoming stimuli immediately after firing. the notion of refractoriness can be scaled up to postulate refractory periods affecting the neural generators of the auditory erp  <cit> . however, the notion of the refractory period has been questioned because the time course of response attenuation is not as expected. refractoriness is greatest immediately after a neuron has responded, with sensitivity gradually increasing as time passes. however, attenuation of the response to the second stimulus in a tone pair or tone train is greater when the tones of the pair or train are separated by  <dig> ms than when they are separated by shorter isis of 100- <dig> ms. to account for this, sable et al.  <cit>  proposed a process of latent inhibition, derived from a physiological model developed by loveless and colleagues  <cit>  to explain the effects of within-pair isi on the neuromagnetic response to tone pairs. according to this model, the initial tone of the pair activates n <dig> generators and this activation then spreads to other areas where further excitatory and inhibitory circuits are activated. the inhibitory circuits act in a feedback loop that reduces the activation of the n <dig> generators to subsequent stimuli, although this process takes approximately  <dig> ms to become fully functional.

the third possibility, of response enhancement to the second tone of a pair, was also discussed by loveless et al.  <cit> , with regard to situations where the second tone occurred after a short isi. according to the latent inhibition model, we would not expect response attenuation if the isi was less than  <dig> ms. loveless et al.  <cit>  reported that in this case enhancement of the response to the second tone was observed. they identified two distinct neural generators contributing to the neuromagnetic response  and the amplitude enhancement seen at isis from 70- <dig> ms reflected activation of the later, more anteriorly-located source .

sable et al.  <cit>  examined amplitude modulation of the electrophysiological analogue of this neuromagnetic response  following presentation of short trains of stimuli at isis of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ms to evaluate whether latent inhibition, refractoriness, or a combination of both processes best explained the n <dig> amplitude modulation. they found that n <dig> amplitude attenuation to the second tone of the sequence was maximal at isis of  <dig> ms, consistent with the latent inhibition model. however, they did not find enhancement of n <dig>  compared to the first tone in the train, at isis less than  <dig> ms. these differences may reflect the use of short, five-tone trains of stimuli by sable et al., rather than longer trains of paired-tone sequences, as used by loveless et al.  <cit>  and müller et al.  <cit> . although they differ in terms of whether simple summation or enhancement occurs at isis of less than  <dig> ms, müller et al.  <cit>  and sable et al.  <cit> , note that the period prior to which response attenuation is seen may correspond to the temporal window over which successive auditory events are integrated as a single unit.

according to this account, development of auditory temporal integration can be studied by measuring the brain's response to tones separated by varying isis. bishop and mcarthur  <cit>  examined the neural processing of unattended auditory stimuli by comparing the event-related potentials  elicited to single tones with those of tones pairs separated by isis of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ms. their results indicated that the erps elicited by tones separated by  <dig> and  <dig> ms were distinguishable in the older participants aged between  <dig> and  <dig> years. in contrast, younger participants  failed to elicit distinguishable neural responses to tone pairs separated by intervals of  <dig> or  <dig> ms. rather a single neural response was elicited, similar to that seen when only one tone was presented. delays in the maturation of this discrimination process have been linked to developmental disorders of language, and these authors reported that the neural processing of auditory stimuli in a group of children with specific language impairment resembled that of the younger control cohort. the mechanisms underpinning the normal developmental trajectory are not understood, but measurement of the neural activity elicited in response to auditory stimuli presented at varying isis allows examination of the processes contributing to this aspect of auditory processing maturation.

the study by bishop and mcarthur  <cit>  included only eight typically-developing children in each of two broad age bands. furthermore, the stimuli in their tone pairs differed in frequency and duration, and they did not attempt to distinguish a summation account of responses to tone pairs from hypotheses involving refractoriness or enhancement. the present study took this line of work further. we assessed a sample of younger children than those reported in bishop and mcarthur  <cit>  and the auditory task included a broader range of isis  to allow examination of refractory processes, temporal integration, and latent inhibition. in the present study both tones of the pair were the same frequency  and duration , making it possible to compare responses to tone  <dig> and tone  <dig> directly. tones were presented at a lower intensity than was used by bishop and mcarthur  <cit> , and no frequency-deviant stimuli were presented.

the aims of the study were twofold: the first aim was to identify an index of integration of rapidly presented auditory information, reflected in the evoked responses to tone pairs presented at increasing isis. it was predicted that adults would show n <dig> enhancement to the second tone of the pair at within-pair isis of 100- <dig> ms relative to that elicited by the single tone. the second aim was to examine whether children would show attenuation of the early sensory erp peak  to the second tone in a pair at shorter isis, in line with a refractory process, or latent inhibition as proposed by sable et al. . the patterns of erp peak amplitude modulation expected based on models of latent inhibition, refractoriness, and facilitation, across the differing isis used in this study, are shown graphically in figure  <dig> 

RESULTS
intra-class correlation coefficient  analyses
the similarity of the erp waveforms elicited to the tone pairs presented at each isi was compared to that elicited by a single tone by computing the individual iccs over the 0- <dig> ms time range , and the mean iccs for the two age groups are summarised in table  <dig>  this method of analysis allowed examination of the early erp waveforms elicited, and is particularly useful when characteristic peaks are not identifiable  <cit> . a high icc indicates that the waveform to the tone pair is similar to the waveform for a single tone, i.e. that the responses to the two tones in the pair are integrated. the auditory evoked responses elicited in the child sample were considerably noisier than those elicited in the adult sample, reflected in a lower icc between the waveform elicited to the single tone and the waveform elicited to the  <dig> ms isi tone-pair condition  =  <dig> , p = .03). given this overall age group difference, the effects of isi were analysed within each age group. for the adult sample, the main effect of isi was significant,  =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> = .29); the iccs were significantly lower than the 400-ms isi condition for tone pairs presented at all isis below  <dig> ms, and in excess of 29% of the variance in scores within each condition was explained by isi. for the child sample, there was a significant main effect of isi, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> = .11; iccs were significantly lower than the 400-ms isi condition for tone pairs presented at  <dig> ms isi, but effect sizes were negligible at isis smaller than  <dig> ms . in sum, the waveforms of the adults indicated differentiation of the neural responses to rapid tone pairs and those to single tones, whereas for the children, this differentiation was not seen with isis below  <dig> ms.

analyses of erps corrected for response overlap
when the tones were presented at short isis, the identification of the evoked response to the second tone of the tone pair is confounded by overlapping potentials elicited in response to the first tone. therefore, the second set of analyses was conducted on the erp waveforms corrected for response overlap as described in methods. the corrected grand-averaged waveforms elicited in response to the second tone of the tone-pair are shown in figure  <dig>  for the adult sample, a clear n <dig> peak is identifiable in each isi condition and the amplitude of the n <dig> peak appears smaller following the  <dig> ms isi than following shorter isis. for the child sample, the grand-averaged waveform at midline sites is dominated by a positive deflection, peaking at  <dig> ms , and a late negative deflection, peaking at  <dig> ms  at temporal sites the waveform is dominated by a positive deflection, peaking at  <dig> ms , and a subsequent negativity, peaking at  <dig> ms .

principal components analysis  to identify latency ranges
pca of the subtracted waveforms from adults over the interval  <dig> -  <dig> ms was conducted based on the latency ranges over which the n <dig> deflection differed significantly from zero, using the correction for multiple comparisons as recommended by guthrie & buchwald  <cit> . four factors with eigenvalues greater than  <dig>  were extracted, accounting for  <dig> % of the variance in the data. plots of the rotated component loadings are presented in figure  <dig>  graphically depicting the time course of each factor, as recommended by picton et al.  <cit> . for ease of visual comparison, the grand averaged erps at each site, summed across participants and isis, are also presented on the same time-scale. the latency intervals determined for the pca components were calculated as the interval over which the rotated factor loading for a specific component exceeded the loadings on any of the orthogonal components. the maximal loadings on the first pca component , from 98- <dig> ms, corresponded in latency with the middle portion of the n <dig> peak in adults . the maximal loadings on the second pca component , from 74- <dig> ms, corresponded in latency with the early portion of the n <dig> peak . the maximal loadings on the third pca component , from  <dig> ms to  <dig> ms, corresponded in latency with the late portion of the n <dig> peak . the fourth component  explained less than 10% of the variance in the data and has not been interpreted further. based on these results, the early-n <dig>  mid-n <dig>  and late-n <dig> components in the adult sample were quantified at fz and cz over the latency windows 74- <dig> ms, 98- <dig> ms, and 126- <dig> ms respectively, for subsequent analyses. in the child sample, pca of the corrected waveforms over the interval 58- <dig> ms  identified seven factors with eigenvalues greater than  <dig> , explaining  <dig> % of the variance in the data, although components  <dig> to  <dig> explained less than 10% of the variance in the data and have not been interpreted further. the maximal loadings on the first pca component  occurred over the interval 150- <dig> ms, corresponding in latency to a negative deflection, seen most clearly at the lateral sites, t <dig> and t <dig>  we have labeled this pca component n1c, after the nomenclature used by bruneau et al.  <cit> , pang and taylor  <cit> , and woods  <cit> . the second pca component  loaded maximally over the latency interval 102- <dig> ms and corresponds to the positive deflection at the lateral temporal sites, predominant over the right hemisphere . we labelled this pca component ta, based on the nomenclature adopted by woods  <cit> . the third pca component , with maximal factor loadings from 58- <dig> ms, corresponded in latency with the clearly identifiable frontally-distributed positive peak, labelled p <dig>  based on the results from this analysis, the erp components were quantified at fz, cz, t <dig>  and t <dig> as the mean amplitudes over the latency windows 58- <dig> ms , 102- <dig> ms  and 150- <dig> ms .

given the marked differences in morphology of the waveforms for the adult and child sample, we have not attempted to directly relate the component structure for the adult fronto-central n <dig> to those identified in the analysis of the p1/t-complex observed in the child sample. although source dipole analysis has identified similar neural generators in children and adults, it is not clear which deflections in the two waveforms represent activity from the same underlying neural generators .

mean amplitudes over the early, middle, and late n <dig> latency intervals for the adult sample are summarized in table  <dig>  mean amplitudes over the p <dig> and ta latency intervals for the child sample are summarized in table  <dig>

partial η <dig> for the contrast of the amplitude at each isi with the single tone is also shown.

for adults, early-n <dig> elicited by the second tone of the pair was significantly smaller in amplitude than following a single tone at longer isis, with the amplitude attenuation failing to reach statistical significance at isis below  <dig> ms  =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> = .15). this agrees with findings by sable et al.  <cit>  for brief trains of tones, and is consistent with attenuation resulting from an inhibitory process that does not become fully functional for approximately  <dig> ms after the first tone onset. amplitude modulation of the mid-n <dig> latency interval as a function of isi failed to reach statistical significance  =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> = .08). in contrast, amplitude over the late-n <dig> latency interval was significantly enhanced to the second tone, relative to the single tone, when separated by isis of 100- <dig> ms  =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> = .31).

in the child sample, p <dig> amplitude elicited to the second tone of the pair was significantly reduced when the second tone was presented at shorter isis, but not at longer isis, consistent with attenuation resulting from a refractory effect rather than an inhibitory process. p <dig> amplitude was significantly reduced, compared to the single tone, when tone pairs were presented at isis shorter than  <dig> ms  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> =  <dig> ). to assess whether p <dig> was elicited at the shorter isis, the amplitude of the waveform over the p <dig> latency range at fz was compared with a test value of zero. no statistically significant p <dig> was elicited at  <dig> ms isis  = - <dig> , p = .82),  <dig> ms isis  =  <dig> , p = .64), or  <dig> ms isis  =  <dig> , p = .25). ta amplitude was more positive over the right hemisphere  than the left hemisphere   =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> =  <dig> ), and was significantly less positive for tones presented at isis shorter than  <dig> ms than for the single tone  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> =  <dig> ).

isi modulated n1c amplitude, and the effect of isi was further qualified by a significant interaction with site  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  ε = . <dig>  partial η <dig> =  <dig> ). separate analyses of the effect of isi were conducted at each site, adjusting for the number of comparisons. thus, the alpha level used for each test of significance was  <dig> . the mean amplitudes at each site across the differing isi conditions are presented graphically in figure  <dig>  the amplitude over this latency interval was significantly enhanced at  <dig> ms isis relative to the single tone condition at fz and cz sites, with statistically non-significant amplitude modulation at the lateral sites, t <dig> and t <dig>  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  partial η <dig> =  <dig> ; cz main effect of isi, f =  <dig> , p = .001; partial η <dig> =  <dig> ; t <dig> main effect of isi, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  partial η <dig> =  <dig> ; t <dig> main effect of isi, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  partial η <dig> =  <dig> ). this result indicates that the fronto-centrally distributed negative enhancement over this interval is distinct from the temporally-distributed n1c component. in view of the latency of the component , the topography of the isi effect , and the effect of the experimental manipulation of isi , we have identified this component as equivalent to the late-n <dig> identified in the adult sample.

discussion
the primary aim of the current study was to examine the development of auditory processing, as indexed by electrophysiological measures which are not influenced by response demands that can contribute to age-related differences on behavioral measures. the results from this study showed that there is a marked change in the neural responses to brief tone pairs from childhood to adulthood. in children a distinct neural response was elicited at isis above  <dig> ms, but not when tone pairs were separated by isis of  <dig> ms,  <dig> ms, or  <dig> ms, whereas in early adulthood, a distinct neural response was elicited to tones presented at isis of  <dig> ms and longer. the results provide further validation for the use of the icc in the study of auditory temporal processing  <cit>  and extend the previously reported findings by showing that this measure can provide a sensitive index of neural responsiveness to rapidly presented auditory information in children as young as  <dig> years. it is necessary to be cautious when directly comparing the results from the present study with those reported by bishop and mcarthur given the methodological differences between the two studies, such as differences in the specific isis used; differences in the duration and intensity of the tones, and differences in the tasks that children were engaged in during tone presentation. nevertheless, the observed estimate of between  <dig> and  <dig> ms for the younger children  in our study and between  <dig> and  <dig> ms for the older children  reported in the earlier study  <cit>  leads us to speculate that developmental changes in auditory temporal processing may be identifiable over these age ranges with the icc index, and warrants further investigation using this technique. however, it is noted that the signal-to-noise ratio was lower in the child waveforms than in the adult waveforms, and this factor may have contributed to the attenuation of the response to the second tone at isis of 25- <dig> ms.

the absolute magnitude of the temporal resolution in children estimated in the present study and bishop et al.  <cit>  is considerably larger  than with previous estimates using behavioral gap detection tasks   <cit> . in adults, the elicitation of the p1-n1-p <dig> complex has been shown to relate to behaviorally determined gap detection thresholds, with attenuation of the response to the second tone when presented at subthreshold gap durations  <cit> . it does not therefore seem appropriate to regard the developmental trend seen here as indicative of an improvement in auditory temporal discrimination. an alternative way of interpreting the results is to see the distinctive neural responses to tones at differing isis as reflecting a process of temporal integration, whereby repeated sounds are grouped together in a single auditory object. the notion of auditory objects is a highly disputed one, and the specific features, such as the spectral and temporal composition of the incoming sound, which define an object have been the subject of recent neuroscientific research  <cit> . the results from the present study highlight the importance of the contextual temporal features of the incoming sound source in auditory perception, as postulated by krumbholz et al <cit> , and show that detailed analysis of the n <dig> sub-components that can be identified in electroencephalograph   <cit>  and magnetoencephalograph  recordings  <cit>  can contribute to an understanding of the role of temporal processing in auditory perception. a listener may still be able to discriminate changes in stimulus features of an auditory object, as may be caused by presence of a gap  <cit> , and so this explanation is compatible with gap detection thresholds being smaller than auditory integration thresholds. an explanation in terms of auditory integration was proposed by loveless  <cit>  following observation of an enhancement in the neuromagnetic response  to tone pairs presented at stimulus onset asynchronies ranging from 70- <dig> ms. however, again, the time intervals obtained in this study are not entirely in line with expectation. wang et al.  <cit> , for instance, compared children and adult's neural responses to deviant tones in a mismatch negativity  paradigm, and noted that a sequence of two different deviants elicited a single mmn when tones were separated by inter-stimulus intervals of  <dig> ms for adults,  <dig> ms for 9- to 11-year-olds, and  <dig> ms for 5- to 8-year-olds. if we regard the enhancement of the fronto-central negativity culminating at approximately  <dig> ms in adults and  <dig> ms in children as a marker of the integration of the second stimulus with the preceding stimulus, then our results suggest a somewhat shorter window of temporal integration of  <dig> ms for 7- <dig> year-old children, and, as far as the morphology of the response to a tone pair is concerned adults show a distinctive response to the second tone with isi as short as  <dig> ms. however, it should be noted that the estimates derived from the mmn paradigm indicate the earliest latency that is longer than the temporal window of integration, rather than the isis that fall within the temporal window of integration. an alternative explanation for the varying estimates of the temporal integration time could relate to the postulated neural mechanisms contributing to auditory integration associated with different psychoacoustic features. in the double deviant mismatch paradigm used by wang et al.  <cit> , the first deviant stimuli differed from standard tones in frequency and the second deviant tone differed from the standard tones in intensity. temporal integration time was assessed by determining the isi at which the second deviant elicited a distinct mmn. the finding of two distinct mmns at isis exceeding  <dig> ms supports the contention that both features were independently coded despite the regular co-occurrence of the deviants in the sequence. neural coding that contributes to auditory segregation based on frequency commences peripherally, with tonotopic representation at the cochlear level. perceptual streaming following presentation of continuous sequences of tones increases with increases in the magnitude of the frequency difference between the tones  <cit> . in the present study, auditory objects were defined by temporal separation of sequential tone pairs presented at the same frequency and intensity. estimates of the temporal integration window may depend on the specific features underpinning auditory segregation. alternatively, differing estimates of the temporal window of integration in these two studies could relate to the refractory period of the neural generators. in the current study, tone pairs were separated by a longer inter-trial interval , allowing greater recovery of the neural responses to stimuli than was possible with the continuous tone sequences presented at the relatively short isis by wang et al.  <cit> . these results suggest that the notion of a constant temporal window of integration that applies across all stimulus types and methods may be misguided, and that both stimulus characteristics and methods of measurement may give different temporal estimates.

the second major aim of the present study was to examine the relative contributions of refractoriness and latent inhibition to the amplitude modulation observed at varying isis in adults and children. in adults, the early n <dig> was attenuated at longer isis, with the largest effect at isis of  <dig> ms, consistent with the operation of a latent inhibitory process, as suggested by sable et al.  <cit> . in children, the amplitude of p <dig> was attenuated at shorter isis, consistent with a refractory process, and there was no evidence for the operation of the latent inhibitory process that had been observed at longer isis in the adult sample. it is not possible to determine from the current results whether the latent inhibitory process is not yet functional in 7- <dig> year-old children, or whether it operates over a longer temporal interval than we examined. our results raise the possibility that one factor influencing the length of the temporal window in children is the enhanced refractoriness of neurons in auditory cortex. given that we found the same pattern of results using two different forms of analysis , it is unlikely that they are due to artefact introduced by the subtraction method. it is possible that the suppression of p <dig> at  <dig> ms isis observed in both analyses is due to overlap with the n <dig> elicited in response to the previous tone, although we think this explanation does not fully explain the results, given that the n <dig> component had been substantially reduced by application of the  <dig> hz high-pass filter, and given that we observed a similar amplitude attenuation of the ta peak at similar isis at lateral sites  where n <dig> was not evident. the results from the current study are at odds with the findings reported by dinces and sussman  <cit> , where a pronounced p <dig>  modulated by the intensity of the stimuli, was elicited at  <dig> ms isis to deviant frequency tones in 9- <dig> year-old children. as noted by these authors, modulation of p <dig> amplitude in their study may have reflected attentional capture by relatively loud stimuli embedded within constantly varying intensity stimuli and further research is required to determine whether the differing results are related to differences in the ages of the samples studied  and/or to differences in the acoustic deviance of the stimuli relative to the preceding train .

in terms of the physiological model developed by loveless et al.  <cit>  and mcevoy et al.  <cit> , the enhancement of the n <dig> ma observed at short isis reflects the activation of a neural generator located in auditory association areas summating with the response to successively presented auditory information. other factors related to cortical maturation, such as synaptic efficacy, myelination and conduction velocity could also have contributed to delay activation of these association areas and alter the timing of the subsequent integration of successively presented tones, thus modulating the neural response to the second tone at faster rates. <dig> the results could also be interpreted in terms of a phase-resetting account, whereby the peaks and troughs in the averaged auditory erp result from ongoing brain oscillations being synchronised at the onset of a stimulus  <cit> ; in this case we would need to postulate that the likelihood of phase resetting is a function of the interval between two stimuli.

although we have identified late n <dig> enhancement in response to auditory stimuli in the present study, wang et al.  <cit>  report a similar enhancement of the n <dig> elicited following presentation of somatosensory stimuli, raising the possibility that this effect may reflect modulation that is common across different sensory systems.

it is difficult to dissociate facilitation from inhibition in most experimental designs, and sable et al.  <cit>  argued that inhibitory mechanisms more parsimoniously explained the postulated facilitation observed in studies where tones had been presented at varying isis. by comparing the neural response to tone pairs with that elicited by a single tone, and by dissociating the underlying n <dig> sub-components with pca, the results from the current study suggest that both processes operate, as proposed by mcevoy et al.  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that adults integrate sequential auditory information into smaller temporal segments than children, and suggest that there are marked maturational changes from childhood to adulthood in the perceptual processes underpinning the grouping of incoming auditory sensory information. in future studies, it would be valuable to include behavioral measures of auditory temporal grouping; our prediction is that this measure will relate to the erp indices studied here. in addition, future research investigating the relationship between the electrophysiological indices elicited in the present paradigm and individual differences in language proficiency is warranted.
