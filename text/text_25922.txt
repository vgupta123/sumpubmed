BACKGROUND
the genomic structure of yeast is much simpler than the genomic organization of multicellular species. with a size of about  <dig> million bases, the yeast genome is shorter than the genomes of most other currently known fungi; neurospora crassa, as well as many other multicellular fungi, have up to  <dig> times larger genomes  <cit> . the genomic organization of yeast is also much simpler than that of its multicellular relatives. the yeast genome exhibits a rather straightforward pattern of coding genes with 5'-control  regions, usually intron-less coding-sequences , and very short 5'- and 3'-utrs  surrounding the coding sequences. the genome is densely packed with known genes, leaving only short intergenic sequences with a typical size of 300– <dig> bases  <cit> .

recent reports highlighted very different aspects of alternate regulative modes of gene expression in yeast. several of them emphasize non-protein coding rna molecules: the data in steigele and nieselt  <cit>  showed an unexpected complexity of antisense transcripts, that could potentially bypass or supplement classical gene regulation. havilio et al  <cit>  analyzed protein coding regions in the s. cerevisiae genome. a substantial number of these sequences have no apparent orthologs in other species. nevertheless, havilio et al demonstrated abundant transcription of many of these orphan transcripts. a plausible working hypothesis is that most of these sequences are in fact non-coding rnas  similar to mrna-like ncrnas  <cit>  that were erroneously annotated as protein coding genes.

recent tiling array experiments  <cit>  revealed abundant transcription of intergenic regions. in total, at least 80% of the yeast genome shows evidence of transcription. these observations emphasize the need for a concise computational analysis of non-coding rnas in yeast, and for a comparison of those elements with verified transcripts of recent large-scale experiments.

previously, only one computational study has been conducted to discover new ncrnas in yeast  <cit> . this work focused on small ncrna genes only, disregarding all structures that overlap with known features such as coding-sequences and utrs. several authors have pointed out, however, that structured rnas might also be abundant in utrs  <cit>  as well as in protein coding regions  <cit> . therefore, we consider here the entire yeast genome using rnaz  <cit> , a comparative method for the de novo identification of structured rnas. structured rnas are defined here to be either an ncrna gene, or a conserved rna structure embedded within coding sequences or utrs. a detailed comparison of the predicted rnas is provided, with experimental evidence from recent high-throughput experiments.

RESULTS
a large number of structured rnas in the yeast genome
we screened the genomes of the seven yeast species s. cerevisiae, s. paradoxus, s. mikatae, s. kudriavzeii, s. bayanus, s. castelli and s. kluyveri for structured rnas. the coverage of the multiz multiple sequence alignments  was almost complete, covering  <dig> % of the  <dig> mb yeast genome. this input data set consisted of  <dig> individual alignment blocks longer than  <dig> bp that were processed in overlapping windows. altogether,  <dig> windows were analyzed, as described in the methods section.

washietl et al  <cit>  showed that an rna classification confidence value  larger than  <dig>  presents a plausible trade-off between specificity and sensitivity for most classes of non-coding rnas. thus, we used this psvm value as the lower cutoff value. in addition, we report the data for a more conservative psvm cutoff of  <dig> . with a psvm value larger than  <dig> ,  <dig> windows with an rna structure were found. of these,  <dig> windows have a psvm value larger than  <dig> . to remove false positives, we shuffled the alignments of all windows with a structured rna and recalculated the probability of the shuffled alignment to contain a structured rna. to be conservative, we removed predictions for which the shuffled alignments were also classified as structured rnas with an above-cutoff classification confidence. this filtering step, indicated by a * in the following, retained  <dig> candidates at psvm∗

most predicted rna structures overlap with genomic loci with known annotations
in order to assess the sensitivity of our screen, we compared our predictions with the saccharomyces genome database , which provides an almost complete annotation of the yeast genome. we analyzed all features of the yeast genome that are related to the transcriptional output of the yeast genome and further subdivided these into several classes, including ncrna  and several types of features that are related to proteins or more generally to mrnas . a total of  <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  'predicted rna elements' from the  <dig>  and  <dig>  psvm∗

we found the majority of all known ncrnas overlapped with 'predicted rna elements' . conserved classes of ncrnas were almost completely recovered by this screen: of  <dig> trnas, which are present in the input alignments , we recovered  <dig>  about 12% of them were dropped in the filtering step at the  <dig>  psvm value cutoff-level, however. we almost completely recovered the ribosomal rnas, which are encoded by the rdn <dig> and rdn <dig> loci.

in contrast to the strong and stable rnaz signals of the known ncrna genes, the signals of predictions in the coding sequences are systematically weaker and are less likely to be destroyed by the shuffling procedure: only  <dig> % of shuffled windows were again classified as 'structured rna' compared to  <dig> % of the entire screen. however, the majority of the predicted signals within the coding sequence vanished when they were filtered at the more restrictive  <dig>  psvm∗
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabaqabegadaaakeaacqwgqbaudaqhaawcbagaem4uamlaemovaylaemyta0eabagaey4fiocaaaaa@3278@ value cutoff level. this effect is not simply explained by a higher mean sequence identity of coding sequences, because many classes of ncrnas, in particular trnas and rrnas, are much less variable than the coding sequences .

to evaluate the sensitivity of the screen, we defined the sensitivity as the proportion of correctly predicted rna genes  divided by the number of known rna genes , i.e. se = tp/t. the sensitivity of the genome-wide screen is the composite of two effects, namely the sensitivity of the rnaz classificator and the quality of the input alignments. in order to assess the latter contribution, we counted the total number of all known rna genes that are represented in the input alignments. almost all ncrna genes reported in s. cerevisiae are present in the other yeast genomes and are also present in the multiple alignments. we concluded that the sensitivity of our screen is thus dominated by rnaz. for rrnas and trnas we found se =  <dig>  and se =  <dig> , respectively, while we detected essentially all the transposable elements. altogether, we predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> known ncrnas, yielding a sensitivity of 69%.

structured rnas associated with protein coding sequences
altogether, we found  <dig> coding sequences in s. cerevisiae that contained at least one structured rna predicted by rnaz . because of the general lack of a systematic analysis of structured rnas in cds regions, and in order to assess the false discovery rate in coding sequences , we decided to re-evaluate the predictions of rna structures found in the cds more carefully.

the idea was firstly, to include a wider range of species in the search of conserved structures in coding-sequences to counterbalance the higher average sequence similarity in coding regions, and secondly, to employ a refined alignment and shuffling procedure that corrects specifically for potential biases arising from the special structure of coding sequences . to ensure that highly similar sequences were not dominating the alignments, we always chose the four most diverged sequences. this is especially useful in sequence-based comparisons of coding-sequences that mutate much more slowly than sequences of ncrnas and are therefore much more similar. also, to achieve a high sequence diversity we used additional yeast species for the analysis that are more distant to s. cerevisiae. for the search of orthologs the following species were used: s. kudriavzeii, s. mikatae, s. kluyveri, s. paradoxus, s. castelli, s. bayanus, a. gossypii and s. pombe.

as a first step, we searched for orthologous sequences of s. cerevisiae proteins. of  <dig> cds,  <dig> have no ortholog or are duplicated in s. cerevisiae and were disregarded. the remaining  <dig> cds were then re-screened using the 'shuffled-cds method' with the following result: at the cutoff level of  <dig> ,  <dig> of  <dig> cds were found to contain a predicted conserved rna structure. at the nucleotide level, the average mean percent identity of the rna structure positive alignments was  <dig> % compared to  <dig> % overall .

next, we considered whether the  <dig> cds harboring a conserved rna structure had common functions. for these, we analyzed the cds by means of the gene ontology  <cit>  . sgd provided gene ontology  terms for  <dig> of these genes. interestingly, we found several large groups with common functional annotations . most of the cds are involved in metabolic functions. we found the largest group of cds function within non-membrane-bound organelles, especially within the mitochondrion. other significant go groups are involved in the formation of the ribosome, and catabolic functions such as protein catabolism or asparagin or carbohydrate metabolism.

only significant groups larger than five cds are reported. the p-values of a set of go annotated genes is determined for a set of genes against the background of all genes in the genome sharing the same go annotation .

at least some of the predicted rna structures found within the cds showed some covariant sites that lead to different substitutions of the corresponding amino acids. two examples are given in figure  <dig> 

structured rnas in utrs of protein-coding genes
a group of predicted elements was found in the immediate vicinity of the protein coding sequences. in the case of yeast, most cds unfortunately lack annotation of the exact transcript structure, so the exact positions of the 5'- and 3'-utrs are unknown. we therefore pragmatically considered a window of  <dig> base pairs upstream and downstream of a cds as a likely utr. this approximation conforms with the approximation for utr length given by hurowitz et al  <cit> . we predicted  <dig> structured rnas , which are approximately evenly distributed between 5'- and 3'-utrs. further details are shown in table  <dig> .

number of putative utrs  containing one or more structured rnas. 'distance' denotes the mean distance of predicted rna structures from the cds boundaries.

go terms are available for  <dig> of the  <dig> cds that have a predicted rna element in their 5'-utr. here, we report selected significant groups larger than five cds only. the most significant functional classes are development , regulation of cellular physiological processes , response to stress , a larger group of genes involved in the transport and localization of other proteins  and a group of genes involved in the cell cycle . a much large number of cds with 5' structures are annotated constituents of non-membrane-bound organelle . here, the biggest subgroup consists of mitochondrial proteins. around a quarter of all cds with structured 5'-utrs are related to mitochondrial function, homeostasis or integrity of mitochondria .

specific functional groupings are also found for the predicted 3'-utr structures. go terms are provided for  <dig> of the  <dig> cds in question. significant gene groups are involved in amino acid metabolism  or are constituents of the ribosome . similar to cds with rna structures in their 5'-utr, proteins were found that are constituents of non-membrane-bound organelles are again significantly overrepresented .

increasing the sequence intervals adjacent to a cds should begin to cover elements that are independently transcribed. we therefore considered the distribution of rnaz hits in intervals with lengths increasing from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs . as expected, the number of positive predictions increases approximately linearly with interval length. surprisingly, however, we found a strong bias towards structured rnas at the 5'-side of the cds. with increasing distance from the cds boundaries, more rna structure at the 5'- than the 3'-ends of the cds was found. recall that this bias is not present for the shortest interval, which essentially covers the utrs.

a possible explanation for this is that many of these rnaz hits are associated with promoter regions. in order to investigate this possibility, we used the data on transcription factor binding sites in yeast that were compiled by harbison et al  <cit> . in addition, a higher number of tf-binding sites is covered by rna structures on the 5'-end of cds. the increased number of structures in the 5' region indeed strongly correlated with an increased number of overlapping tf-binding sites .

interestingly, we found several transcription factor binding-sites that are frequently covered by predicted rna structures . with the exception of dig <dig>  these transcription factors are involved in stress response  and/or the cell cycle .

comparison of number of tf-binding sites of the six transcription factors cbf <dig> , dig <dig> , mbp <dig> , mcm <dig> , reb <dig> , swi <dig>  overlapping with a predicted rna structure with total number of tf-binding sites of these transcription factors. tf-binding site data were taken from  <cit> .

novel ncrnas in yeast
a total of  <dig> unannotated predicted rna elements  are located in intergenic, non-utr regions. the first question is if any of these elements are conserved outside of the hemiascomycetes. we therefore performed homology searches using blastn  <cit>  with the following genomes: neurospora crassa, cryptococcus neoformans, aspergillus nidulans, gibberella zeae and ustilago maydis. only one significant hit was found, which is a short  duplication of the 26s-rna in vicinity to the original rrna-cluster on chromosome  <dig> of s. cerevisiae. all other predicted elements seem to be restricted to the hemiascomycetes phylum.

we also searched specialized ncrna databases to see if some of the  <dig> rnaz hits can be annotated by homology with a known functional ncrna. a blast search  in the noncode database  <cit>  revealed two significant hits. one element is the snorna snr <dig> that was recently identified by schattner et al  <cit> . this sequence was not included in the release of the saccharomyces genome database used in this work. the other element is 100% identical over a length of  <dig> nucleotides to an rna from mice annotated as u <dig> rna. however, intensive searches in mammalian genomes convinced us that this sequence is most likely a contamination and misclassified in noncode . searches of the rfam database  <cit>  using sean eddy's infernal software  <cit>  did not provide additional annotation information.

the intergenic candidates were screened using snogps  <cit>  and snoscan  <cit>  for putative box h/aca and box c/d snornas, respectively. we found  <dig> box c/d candidates and  <dig> putative box h/aca snornas. the latter candidates have  <dig> putative uridylation targets in ssu or lsu rrna. more than half of these target sites are also targeted by other, previously known snornas. this high redundancy might explain why the deletion and/or depletion of many snornas is not lethal  <cit> : there exists a functional backup within the genome. a list of snorna candidates and their predicted target sites is provided in additional file  <dig> 

recently, several large scale-studies using yeast tiling arrays were published. david et al  <cit>  used tiling arrays to determine the transcribed portion of the yeast genome. samanta et al  <cit>  and davis et al  <cit>  used tiling arrays to analyze the effect of deletions of essential rna processing proteins on the yeast transcriptome. taken together, these three studies provide evidence for approximately  <dig> transcribed genomic regions not covered by the sgd annotation.

in summary, transcription of  <dig>  of the predicted intergenic rna elements is verified by tiling array data, for additional  <dig> elements there is evidence from ests and/or sage data . some prominent examples are shown in figure  <dig> 

a predicted rna structure is reported as transcribed if its overlap with an experimentally verified transcript is larger than 50%. rnaz hits shows the total number of intergenic rnaz hits that overlap a transcript. intergenic regions describes the number of intergenic regions, that are covered by at least one predicted rna structure. intergenic transcripts shows the total number of intergenic transcripts. intergenic regions depicts the number of intergenic regions that are covered by at least one transcript. all transcripts that collapse to one genomic locus were counted once in the rows combined and total combined. the numbers given in the intergenic regions column were used to calculate p-values . the p-values are calculated for the one-sided hypergeometric test against the null hypothesis of odds-ratio ≤  <dig> 

interestingly, intergenic transcripts seem to be enriched with rna secondary structure . samanta et al further provided a sub-classification of intergenic transcripts into real intergenic transcripts and transcripts that are associated with known promoter regions. interestingly,  <dig> of  <dig> rna elements overlap with promoter-based transcripts . however, there is little intersection between the individual transcript datasets: only eight rna elements overlap with transcripts described by david et al and davis et al, and four rna elements with transcripts from david et al and samanta et al. the predicted rna elements overlapping with transcripts as predicted by the tiling arrays fall into at least two classes: most of our predicted rna structures are smaller than the transcripts with which they are overlapping. one exception is a subset of transcripts described by david et al that were found using total rna, where a large fraction of the transcripts  was of equal size or even smaller than the predicted rna structure.

a similar number of the intergenic rna structures were also verified by est sequences. from the  <dig> ests that unambiguously map mainly to intergenic regions of the yeast genome,  <dig> ests overlap with  <dig> predicted  ncrnas. to check for typical signals of pol-ii transcripts, we searched for poly- tails using the program trimest  <cit>  . of the original  <dig> est sequences, trimest predicted  <dig> est sequences would contain poly- tails. three of these poly- containing est sequences  overlap with a predicted rna structure.

in addition, the overlap of these sequences with  <dig> intergenic sage-tags  <cit>  was analyzed. here,  <dig> different tags overlapped with  <dig> predicted ncrnas.

non-coding antisense transcripts
one question that arises when analyzing rna structure elements is their overlap with known antisense transcripts. we compared predicted rna elements with transcribed antisense sequences deduced from tiling array data  <cit> :  <dig> predicted rna structures  that overlapped with antisense transcripts were found. it was shown previously that s. cerevisiae exhibits a large number of cds that overlap as sense/antisense pairs  <cit> . of these  <dig> cis-antisense pairs,  <dig> pairs  have predicted structures in their overlap region. in addition,  <dig> intergenic rna elements form large duplex regions, which potentially act as pure non-coding antisense transcripts .

discussion
the comparative search in several yeasts showed a large number of signals indicative for structured rnas. we found evidence for structured rnas not only in intergenic regions , but also in coding regions and untranslated regions of coding sequences. the only previous in silico study to predict new ncrnas in yeast by mccutcheon and eddy  <cit>  used qrna  <cit>  and was based on pairwise alignments of the intergenic regions only. the authors estimated the sensitivity of their screen to be 45%, measured against known and annotated ncrnas . in contrast to the screen of mccutcheon and eddy, we considered the entire genomic sequence. based on multiple alignments instead of pairwise alignments, our rnaz-based approach has a significantly increased sensitivity and specificity. we recovered  <dig> of the  <dig> known ncrnas in the s. cerevisiae genome, amounting to a sensitivity of 69%. we retrieved almost all known ncrnas that were also detected by qrna, while the overlap with the novel predictions is much smaller. only  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate ncrnas from mccutcheon and eddy  <cit>  are contained in our predictions. mccutcheon and eddy verified the transcription of eight candidate ncrnas  using northern blots; three of these , however, turned out to be false positives in later experiments; ruf <dig> was identified as a misclassified orf. our rnaz-based approach classified ruf <dig>  ruf <dig>  ruf <dig>  ruf5- <dig> and ruf5- <dig> as structured rnas, but did not detect any of the false positives. this observation adds confidence to the specificity of our approach.

surprisingly, the largest single class of predicted rna structures was found in protein coding sequences. by contrast, it is widely believed that rna structures in cds can interfere both with translation and with the evolution of the protein coding sequence  <cit> . furthermore, statistical evidence of widespread secondary structure in eukaryotic cds was recently provided by meyer et al  <cit> . the best-known examples of rna structures that are superimposed on protein coding regions come from viruses: e.g. the rev response element of hiv <dig>  <cit>  or the cis-acting regulation element  in picorna viruses  <cit> . eukaryotic examples are the mammalian steroid receptor activator   <cit>  or the plant gene enod <dig>  <cit> . an example in yeast is ash <dig>  which is one of the best-studied systems for localization of mrnas within the cell  <cit> . the ash <dig> mrna harbours at least four regions  with rna secondary structures within its protein coding region. these localization elements of ash <dig> have no similarity on the sequence level, but are structurally related, thus, it is believed, that these elements function on the structural level  <cit> . our data strongly suggest that this phenomenon is in fact common in yeast.

the relevance of the observation of a large number of structured rna elements in coding regions is supported by an unexpected clustering of functional go annotation terms of the affected protein coding genes. this significant clustering into a small number of functional classes strongly supports the interpretation that these rnaz hits are functional on a posttranscriptional level. the most prominent groups is related to cellular metabolism. another large group of proteins is found to function within the ribosomal complex or within the mitochondria. ash <dig> also belongs to the latter group. many mitochondrial proteins are among the  <dig> organelle-specific proteins that have rnaz signals. this list includes in particular atp <dig> and tim <dig>  both of which are known to be actively transported to the mitochondria  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that many or most of rna structures within coding sequences are functional as localization signals.

structured rna elements in utr regions  often bind trans-acting factors and control important aspects of gene expression, such as translational efficiency, mrna stability and subcellular localization. known examples are iron response elements , the translation control elements , internal ribosome entry sites  and au-rich elements  <cit> . in addition, many cellular targeting signals are located within utrs  <cit> . from our screen, two groups of cds with conserved rna structures in their 3'-utrs seem to be of special importance. first, one group of proteins is involved in the process of translation, mostly ribosomal proteins. shalgi et al  <cit>  also reported that genes with common rna sequence motifs in their 3'-utr that control the stability of the transcripts are enriched in ribosomal proteins. it is conceivable that similar rna motifs are embedded in larger, conserved structured regions that can be detected by rnaz.

the second large group consists of mitochondrial genes with structured 3'-utrs. a number of mrnas corresponding to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are targeted to the vicinity of mitochondria  <cit> . many of the cis-acting mitochondrial localization elements are localized in the 3'-utrs of the transcripts and are shown to be sufficient to target mrnas to mitochondria  <cit> . together with the structured signals found in cds of mitochondrial proteins, this is the first report of an enlarged set for this class of proteins. shalgi et al  <cit>  described a motif common to many mitochondrial proteins, which was also associated with a distinct subcellular localization. it is plausible that more nuclear encoded mitochondrial transcripts are actively transported. however, more subtle roles of transcript localization might exist that seem to be partially redundant, and where the specific localization mechanisms are not yet completely understood.

most of the predicted rna structures with a distance of more than  <dig> bp to the nearest known feature could not be reliably annotated. with a very small number of exceptions, no significant sequence or structural homology outside the saccharomyces genus was found. nevertheless, the combination of three independent tiling array studies, est data, and sage data provide evidence that about  <dig> of these novel intergenic elements are transcribed in s. cerevisiae. as our computational approach is designed to detect stabilizing selection acting on the rna structure, we suggest that these transcripts are functional at the rna level rather than being the mere by-product of other regulatory processes or constituting transcriptional noise.

for a subclass of the novel intergenic elements, we have at least circumstantial evidence that hints at their function. firstly, a significantly larger number of structured rnas is predicted in the 5' vicinity of known protein coding transcripts than in their 3' neighborhood. secondly, tiling array data indicate that many of the transcribed sequences are promoter associated transcripts in the sense that they are transcribed upstream of a gene and covered the promoter region of the gene. structured rna signals are overrepresented in these sequences. one of the current hypotheses about the function of promoter-associated transcripts suggests that these rnas are directly involved in transcriptional regulation of pol ii due to occupied promoter regions  <cit> . recently, such a regulation was shown in yeast for the ncrna srg <dig>  which controls the transcription of its downstream gene ser <dig>  <cit> .

our data also suggest another possibility. recently, thomas et al  <cit>  described a synthetic aptamer that binds with high affinity to pol ii and is able to specifically inhibit transcription. similar cases are known for an ncrna  in mouse, that acts in the same way in response to stress signals  <cit> , and the bacterial 6s rna  <cit> . a non-coding rna, evf- <dig>  that probably acts as a transcriptional enhancer, was recently found in mammals  <cit> . most probably, these molecules are examples of an expanding repertoire of direct transcriptional modifiers. it is thus not implausible that many of the promoter-based transcripts that exhibit a conserved rna structure function via direct modification of the pol ii transcription complex.

finally, our data also indicate that at least some of the predicted structured rnas could be functional by a direct modus via rna-rna interactions: we derived a substantial number of cds/ncrna or ncrna/ncrna antisense overlaps from the computational data, drawing a picture similar to that known in other eukaryotic species  <cit> . this finding further implies that the antisense mechanism is dependent on rna structures, for example to control the accessibility of antisense regions in the first step of duplex formation.

CONCLUSIONS
the comparative analysis of the genomes of seven yeast species to predict evolutionary conserved rna secondary structures provided strong evidence for a large number of small ncrna genes and structural motifs that overlap with known features such as coding seqences and utrs. altogether, we found roughly  <dig> genomic loci that show conserved rna secondary structures; many of these were ranked with high-scoring p-values, indicating several previously unknown ncrnas. furthermore, transcription of a number of predicted elements is supported by experimental data. overall, although our findings are predictions, the present survey of evolutionary conserved structured rna motifs in yeast genomes suggests widespread and diverse functions for structured rnas in these organisms that we are only beginning to understand.
