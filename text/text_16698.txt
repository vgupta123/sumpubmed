BACKGROUND
in  <dig> it was discovered that the kisspeptin activated gpr <dig> receptor is required for maturation and activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis  <cit> . it has been established subsequently that kisspeptin  binding to gpr <dig> releases gonadotropin releasing hormone  from the hypothalamus to stimulate the pituitary-gonadal axis in a multitude of species including humans  <cit> . in mice, gnrh neurons express gpr <dig> from birth and more gnrh neurons acquire expression during pubertal development  <cit> . in rodents, kp is expressed by neurons in the arcuate nucleus  of the hypothalamus and also in the rostral periventricular area of the 3rd ventricle  which includes the anteroventral periventricular nucleus . rising estrogen levels have a positive feedback effect on kp expression in the avpv  <cit>  to initiate the lh surge required for ovulation in females  <cit> . conversely, estrogen and testosterone have a negative feedback effect on kp expression in the arc that is regulated through the estrogen receptor alpha  or through the androgen receptor  respectively  <cit> .

despite the critical importance of gpr54/kisspeptin in mammalian fertility, little is known of the upstream and downstream gene regulatory networks for kisspeptin signaling in the hypothalamus. the feedback relationships between gpr <dig> and kisspeptin are incompletely understood. to address the question of which genes are co-dependent on gpr <dig> and kisspeptin and whether the transcriptional networks of gpr <dig> deficient mice and kisspeptin deficient mice are equivalent, we have taken advantage of the knockout mice we generated during the initial discovery of the gpr54-kisspeptin axis. gpr <dig> and kiss <dig> knockout mice model the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism  found in humans with gpr <dig> mutations  <cit> . although the neuronal inputs and projections of gpr <dig> and kisspeptin are barely described, the hypothalamus is clearly a key site of interest, since the action of kisspeptin on neurons co-expressing gpr <dig> and gnrh are key to the function of the axis. we therefore chose to focus on determining the hypothalamic transcription network, initially scanning the transcriptome with affymetrix exon  <dig>  arrays. these exon arrays contain probes for all of the known and predicted gene exon sequences in the mouse genome, thus representing a near complete, transcriptome profiling method.

using micro-dissected hypothalamic tissues to isolate rna from our mutant mice, we first set out to define the transcriptional differences between the knockout mice. since the gpr54-kisspeptin axis is subject to hormonal feedback and the knockout mice are pre-pubertal, we also tested the hormonal dependence/independence of each differentially expressed transcript. to avoid variation in gene expression due to fluctuations in the levels of circulating hormones during the female estrous cycle, only male mice and testosterone  exposure were used in this study. we utilized a study designed to define purely t-regulated transcription, purely genotype-dependent transcription and transcription dependent on both t and genotype, with interaction or no interaction between these variables.

RESULTS
microarray identification of deregulated transcripts from gpr <dig> and kiss <dig> knockout mice hypothalami
we first isolated rna from micro-dissected hypothalamic tissue of knockout and wild-type mice and hybridized this to exon  <dig>  arrays . we compared quantile normalized probe intensity values from affymetrix whole mouse exon array chips where hybridization was performed with wild-type , gpr <dig> knockout  or kiss <dig> knockout  hypothalamic rna. affymetrix results were compared between genotypes, specifically gene expression of all wild-type mice were grouped together and compared with all knockout mice grouped together  or with kiss <dig> knockout mice alone  or gpr <dig> knockout mice alone . additionally, gpr <dig> knockout mice were compared with kiss <dig> knockout mice  to give a total of four groups . gene level and exon level summarization was used in the comparisons and from each of these we selected genes showing a p-value <  <dig>  and an expression fold difference of  <dig>  or greater, as candidates for further analysis .

this analysis yielded  <dig> unique genes, putatively exhibiting differential transcription between wild-type mice and/or either knockout . several global features of the transcription network were apparent in these data. first, we analyzed the functional groupings of genes and noted that signaling molecules and enzymes were the two largest biochemical classes . next, we examined possible network overlaps by analyzing separately for the gko and kko differential gene lists, the possible network connectivity using a curated database of functional interactions, as previously described . interestingly both the gko  and kko  networks show apparently common nodes of signaling via hnf4a and growth factor signaling pathways, however many differences are also seen in the putative networks, suggesting that the effects of kiss <dig> knockout may not be fully equivalent to gpr <dig> knockout. consistent with this notion, we noticed fewer statistically significant gene level  and exon level  transcription differences for kko mice compared with gko. to explore this possibility further we decided to validate a subset of the most pronounced array expression differences by qpcr. genes showing transcription differences were prioritized in the following order: strength of expression, consistency of differences between knockouts, known or suspected roles in hormonal regulation, and finally the availability of quenching qpcr probes for low density  <dig> well qpcr plate analysis. within these criteria, all transcription factors, transmembrane receptors, and signaling molecules that were available were included, resulting in a total of  <dig> genes . qpcr control probe sets for 18s rrna and gapdh were included in each array as loading controls and we also selected a number of genes of interest  based on their known role in gonadotropic signaling, that were not differentially expressed by microarray analysis. thus a total of  <dig> genes were re-validated by microplate qpcr analysis .

we used a  <dig> well plate qpcr array to assay each gene at least  <dig> times per sample  and  <dig> biological replicates of rna prepared from micro-dissected hypothalamic tissue from wild-type, gko and kko mice. after analysis of the count  values by a linear mixed effects model, genes showed statistically significant differential expression in one of the groups,  <dig> of which had a fold change ≥  <dig> ; two of these were genes of interest  and one was a control . all genes with a statistically significant fold change were carried forward for further analysis.

fc = fold change, ci = confidence interval, n.s. = not significant, n.a. = not applicable. gko = gpr <dig> knockout, kko = kisspeptin knockout.

analysis of hormone-dependent and independent hypothalamic gene transcription in gpr <dig> and kiss <dig> knockout mice
array expression analysis of micro-dissected hypothalamic samples revealed significant differential transcription between genotypes. however, since gko and kko mice fail to undergo puberty an unknown number of these transcriptional differences could be explained by the hormonal milieu. to address this, we tested which of these genes exhibited hormonally responsive transcription, by measuring transcriptional differences in the presence or absence of testosterone . wt, gko and kko male mice were castrated and implanted with either a sham silastic capsule, or a t containing capsule . after  <dig> weeks exposure, the mice were killed, the hypothalamus micro-dissected, and the rna extracted. to confirm exposure to t, we measured plasma free testosterone; kko mean free testosterone  <dig>  pg/ml , gko mean free testosterone  <dig>  pg/ml , and wt mean testosterone  <dig>  pg/ml  with zero free testosterone in the castrate/empty silastic implant group. each gene was assayed with at least  <dig> technical replicates and  <dig> biological replicates. to reduce the risk of loss of data due to genotype or hormonal effect on loading controls, we used two independent loading controls, 18s rrna and gapdh. the data were analyzed separately using a linear mixed effects model . we analyzed gko and kko mice separately in a  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> design, considering gene , treatment  and genotype  as categorical variables. tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> summarize the statistically significant , greater than  <dig>  fold expression difference, model results for four classes of variation:  purely hormone-dependent transcription  purely genotype-dependent transcription  hormone and genotype-dependent transcription but with no interaction between these variables and  hormone and genotype-dependent transcription, with co-dependence  between these variables. since two loading controls were used, these are also reported separately as they were treated independently in the analysis. small differences with loading controls were noted, resulting in differences of interaction between genotype and hormone responsiveness for a few transcripts at statistical boundaries of significance. nevertheless, the direction and magnitude of effects were consistent for all genes, with both control probes. we noted fewer statistically significant transcript regulation effects in the kko mice, mirroring the initial observations from microarrays. nevertheless, several genes  were regulated in common with gko mice, albeit with effects of different magnitude. several of the statistically significant qpcr results are of small absolute magnitude and considering the variances of the loading controls between genotypes and treatments, we suggest that interpretation of differences of less than  <dig>  fold may not be meaningful . we further considered only changes of >  <dig>  fold.

fc = fold change, ci = confidence interval, dir = direction of change, relative to t. gko = gpr <dig> knockout, kko = kisspeptin knockout.

fc = fold change, ci = confidence interval, dir = direction of change, relative to wt, gko = gpr <dig> knockout, kko = kisspeptin knockout.

the greatest transcript level regulation was observed for kiss <dig> , measured in gko mice which showed strong hormonal regulation  and moderate genotype dependence . with the 18s rrna loading control, the regulation shows a weak interaction whereas with the gapdh loading control, hormonal regulation, and genotype regulation vary symmetrically and thus no interaction is reported. the hormonal effect of kiss <dig> expression in the male mouse has already been shown  <cit> , here, we validated the kiss <dig> up-regulation in hormonally untreated intact male gko mice by ihc using a kisspeptin antibody that has been previously characterised by our group and others  <cit> . kisspeptin immunoreactivity was examined in coronal sections of the regions containing the anteroventral periventricular nucleus  and the arcuate nucleus  from four wt and four gko adult male mice . in terms of kisspeptin fiber distribution, fibers were found in large numbers in the arc in both wt and gko mice, and with virtually no cell bodies observed in the avpv region. kisspeptin neuron cell bodies, observed by an intense staining in the dorsal part of the arc, are significantly more abundant in the gko arc than the wt arc . kisspeptin fibers have a similar intensity between the two groups. although kisspeptin immunoreactivity is modest in the avpv region, we found more kisspeptin fibers in gko than wt in this region .

the second largest effects were found for the klk1b <dig> gene  showing a significant hormonal influence  and 3- <dig> fold regulation. as expected, the gnrh receptor  also exhibited strong hormonal regulation and a weak genotype effect but with some interaction , however with large variances of expression.

in kko mice, only gnrhr showed a pure hormonal regulation of its transcript and only tmem <dig> showed a purely genotype-dependent regulation. the latter was consistent in direction and magnitude with the levels measured in the non-castrate group of animals used for discovery , emphasizing this to be a robust difference. among the genotype and hormone variant changes, klk1b <dig> showed the greatest differences, more than  <dig> fold, with testosterone exposure and this effect was significantly greater  in the knockout mice  than wild-type.

in gko mice, klk1b <dig> showed a hormone only effect  with the gapdh control, but a hormone effect with genotype interaction using the 18s rrna loading control. gnrhr shows a strong hormonal effect with a genotype interaction - down-regulation in the wild-type mice and up-regulation in the knockout mice in the presence of testosterone. tmem <dig> shows a strong genotype effect in the gko mice , but in the opposite direction to kko mice , and with an additional marginal hormone effect. we confirmed that tmem <dig> is significantly up-regulated in the kko hypothalamus of the intact male mouse as compared to wt by rna in situ hybridization . both kko and wt antisense probes had significantly more intense staining as compared to their respective sense probe control , and there was not a significant difference between the two control sense probes .

to determine whether the up-regulation of the tmem <dig> gene expression in kko mice observed by rt-pcr and in situ hybridization existed at the protein level, we performed a series of western blot experiments . hypothalami dissected from wt and kko intact male mice were separated into the anterior and posterior halves. immunoblot analysis with an anti-tmem <dig> antibody revealed a band at the expected size of  <dig> kda, and other non-specific bands at various sizes. quantification of tmem <dig> protein levels , by normalizing with β-tubulin protein levels, showed significantly higher tmem <dig> protein levels in kko anterior hypothalamus compared to wt . in the posterior hypothalamus, tmem <dig> protein levels were higher in kko than wt, although not significantly .

genotype only effects were seen in gko mice at >  <dig>  fold but less than  <dig> fold for erβ , hhip, lhcgr, and npas <dig>  we also noticed several matrix metalloproteinase  family members  showing mixed hormonal and genotype effects, but for mmp <dig> at a fold change less than  <dig> . mmp <dig> was down-regulated by  <dig>  fold in the gko mice compared to wt and had an independent hormonal effect shown by a  <dig>  fold decrease in gene expression when testosterone treatment was compared to the empty silastic control. mmp <dig> had a genotype only effect in the gko mice and was down-regulated by  <dig>  fold when compared to wt . we did not analyze in a joint statistical comparison the gko and kko transcript variations from the discovery experiment with the gko t- and kko t- animals of the validation experiment, because they are not biologically equivalent , since the immature testis may be a source of feedback regulation to the hypothalamus.

npas <dig>  which has very recently been described  <cit>  as an important activity-dependent transcription factor regulating inhibitory synapse formation in the gabaergic system, was up-regulated in gko mice and was the only novel transcript for which ihc grade antibodies were readily available . the npas <dig> protein was expressed in cortical cell bodies of wt  and gko  mice . npas <dig> immunoreactivity  was also seen in the hippocampus  , posterior hypothalamus   and periventricular hypothalamus   of gko mice whereas no npas <dig> ir was detectable in wt for any of these regions  mice. as previously described, we used the gpr <dig> driven beta-galactosidase activity  to examine co-localisation of gpr <dig> and npas <dig>  however none of the cell bodies overlapped in expression, indicating that the alteration of npas <dig> expression in gko mice is non cell-autonomous with respect to gpr <dig> 

discussion
we have assessed gene expression variability amongst kiss <dig> and gpr <dig> knockout mice  to determine potential gene candidates involved in either direct or indirect regulation of this ligand-receptor pair. initially an affymetrix exon  <dig>  st array consisting of more than  <dig> million probe sets  was used to find gene expression differences between the genotypes and littermate wild-type mice. initial array analysis indicated that while there were many overlapping transcription differences between the alleles, some differences were noted. putative network analysis showed apparently common nodes in hnf4a and some growth factor pathways, however non-overlap was seen in other nodes. moreover fewer statistically significant expression differences were noted in the kiss <dig> knockout mice. we re-validated these transcriptional differences, using qpcr with quenching probes and using two loading control probes. this yielded a set of  <dig> genes with confirmed transcriptional differences between genotypes, which were supplemented with an additional  <dig> genes of interest and controls. since the knockout mice fail to undergo puberty, it was necessary to separate transcripts that may be subject to hormonal regulation, from those that are independent of hormonal regulation. in a second series of experiments we assessed the expression of the  <dig> array-derived gene panel and  <dig> genes of interest, in the hypothalamus of castrated mice, treated with or without hormonal implants prior to gene expression comparisons between genotypes. the comparison of t+, t-, and genotype groups within the linear mixed effects model analysis allowed us to observe genotype-dependent variation of hormonal response and genotype-independent hormonal response.

around  <dig> gnrh expressing neurons are present in the mouse hypothalamus  <cit> . considering the results of the testosterone/genotype experiment, the detection of significant changes in gnrhr and kiss <dig> transcripts indicates that the relevant region of the hypothalamus was sampled and that the method used was capable of picking up transcriptional differences in two genes known to be hormonally regulated. our data show for the first time, counter regulation of kiss <dig> transcripts and protein expression in gpr <dig> knockout mice. this is consistent with previous reports showing that upon interruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, kiss <dig> is elevated in the hypothalamus of rodents  <cit> , primates  <cit>  and women  <cit> .

it has been established that the anteroventral periventricular nucleus  and the arcuate nucleus  are the key regions in the rodent hypothalamus involved in kiss <dig> expression  <cit> . we show here for the first time that kisspeptin expression in male gko mice is localized to the cell bodies in the arc and absent in the avpv. this is in accordance with the sexual dimorphism in kisspeptin expression whereby males have far fewer kisspeptin neurons in the avpv region than females  <cit> . additionally, the kisspeptin neuron cell bodies are significantly more abundant in the gko arc than the wt while kisspeptin fibers have a similar intensity between the two groups. although kisspeptin staining was modest in the avpv region, we found more kisspeptin fibers in gko than wt. thus, the up-regulation in kiss <dig> gene expression in the hypothalamus observed by rt-pcr using the whole hypothalamus actually occurs in the arc only since there were no more kisspeptin cell bodies observed in the avpv from gko compared to wt mice.

small differences, although statistically significant, should be interpreted with caution and considering the degree of variation seen with the loading control estimates for the samples, we did not consider absolute effects of less than  <dig>  fold to be interpretable, even if statistically significant. it should also be noted that especially where interaction effects are seen, genotype and hormone interaction effects may depend upon differences in the hormonal milieu prior to castration, that may have occurred during development and this limitation should be recognized in generalizing the results. for example, regulation of gnrh receptor levels may show a "priming" effect in wild-type castrate mice from prior perinatal sex steroid exposure, compared with knockouts. the reversed direction of hormonal effect for gnrhr between gko and wt is consistent with such an explanation  <cit> . as we were able to observe robust regulation of gnrhr, which is predominantly restricted to the  <dig> or so gnrh expressing neurons in the mouse hypothalamus, this suggests that the study was powered sufficiently to reveal significant commonalities and differences in the transcriptional networks of gpr <dig> and kiss <dig> knockout mice.

interestingly, relatively few large differences in transcription were seen in the initial affymetrix array experiment, and overall, fewer changes were seen in the kiss <dig> knockout mice, than in the gpr <dig> knockout mice. the subsequent detailed qpcr analysis showed this result to be reproducible. although both genotypes fail to undergo puberty, it has been reported that the kisspeptin loss of function alleles may be less severe than the gpr <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . the endogenous basal activity of the gpr <dig> receptor could explain such a difference  <cit>  as could the existence of an unknown weaker binding peptide ligand for gpr <dig>  this result is of importance for future studies directed at understanding the signaling consequences of gpr <dig> and kisspeptin activity.

we did not compare directly the control group of castrate -t mice with the intact knockout mice. although the intact knockout mice are also sexually immature, the intact immature testis may still have active feedback to the hypothalamus and transcription differences would be expected. indeed, a greater difference in kiss <dig> expression was seen in the intact gko mice than the castrate gko mice. this is consistent with reports showing that kiss <dig> expression is up-regulated in the hypothalamus of castrated rodents  <cit> . we also noticed opposite direction of regulation for the genotype-only transcripts  npas <dig> and abca8a between the first and second groups.

the proteolytic pre-processing enzymes responsible for generating active kisspeptins in the hypothalamus are unknown. it has been shown that kp can down-regulate mmp <dig> expression  <cit> . we observed that mmp <dig> is up-regulated when there is kiss <dig> loss in the kko mice and the expected down-regulation is observed when there is gain of kiss <dig> expression, as we see in the gko mice, however these observations are specific to the hormonally treated group for both mutants. similarly mmp <dig> has been shown to be down-regulated by kp  <cit>  and in our study mmp <dig> is down-regulated in the highly expressing kiss <dig> gko mice, although at a fold change less than  <dig> . additionally, reciprocal up-regulation is absent in the kko mice. although it has been demonstrated that mmp9/ <dig> can cleave and inactivate kp, the precise relationship between the mmps and kp remains to be elucidated. mmp <dig> exhibited a  <dig>  fold genotype only regulation, suggesting it as another potential regulator of kisspeptin. although all the mmps were consistent in showing statistically significant transcription changes in our analysis, the extent of regulation was less than  <dig>  fold for mmp <dig> and hence these results should be interpreted with caution.

beyond the matrix metalloproteases, we observed klk1b <dig> to be strongly regulated in the kko and gko mice. klk1b <dig>  also known as β-nerve growth factor -endopeptidase  <cit>  is a member of the kallikrein gene cluster that has been expanded by tandem gene duplication. the predicted activity pattern for klk1b <dig> is cleavage at arg-ser residues, an arrangement found within mouse pre-pro kisspeptin that would result in a  <dig> amino acid peptide, similar to the kp <dig> seen in humans. however, klk1b <dig> does not have an ortholog in the human genome, although several very close paralogs exist in the duplicated kallikreins. the peptide cleavage sequence is not conserved in the human pre-pro kisspeptin, rather, the bond that is cleaved in the human sequence is arg-gly to create the n-terminus of kp- <dig>  <cit> . our data nevertheless suggest that this kallikrein family of peptidases is worthy of future exploration as kisspeptin processing enzymes, especially since we show strong evidence of regulation in response to sex steroids.

tmem <dig> was the only transcript that was consistently up-regulated in the kko mice as compared with wt mice, independent of testosterone exposure and in all groups of kko mice. we confirmed this up-regulation by rna in situ hybridization and western blot analysis of tmem <dig> in the hypothalamus of kko mice as compared to wt mice. tmem <dig> encodes an orphan 10-transmembrane family receptor, whose solutes and activities are unknown. this class of transmembrane proteins can transport a wide variety of molecules, ranging from sugars and amino acids to solutes and are generally linked to ca2+ mediated activation of gene expression. activation of non-selective cation channels and inhibition of inwardly rectifying potassium channels have been shown to be necessary for kp to depolarize gnrh neurons  <cit> . it is possible that tmem <dig> is somehow implicated in the regulation of kisspeptin expression, its expression was high in the kko mice lacking kiss <dig> transcripts and low in the gko mice where kiss <dig> is over-expressed, suggestive of a direct or indirect negative regulator of kisspeptin. future genetic studies of tmem <dig> will be required to evaluate this possibility.

the transcription factor gene npas <dig> was up-regulated in the gko mice with one of the largest fold changes after the kiss <dig> transcripts yet was down-regulated by  <dig>  fold in castrated mice independent of hormonal feedback. this up-regulation in non-castrated mice was confirmed by ihc showing expression of npas <dig> in the hypothalamus of gpr54-/- mice while npas <dig> expression was mostly absent in the wild-type mice. npas <dig> has been credited with regulating the development of inhibitory synapses in activating neurons in the hippocampus  <cit> . interestingly, npas <dig> is activated by an influx of calcium  <cit>  and is independent of the map kinase pathway  <cit> . it has been recently reported that kp-gpr <dig> signaling in the hypothalamus of rats is also independent of the map kinase pathway but can signal with calcium release  <cit> . whether the npas <dig> regulation is direct or an indirect consequence of sexual immaturity, remains to be seen, but its role in calcium dependent activation taken together with our data suggest it may play a role in the gonadotropic axis.

estrogen receptor alpha  expression was higher in both gko and kko mice compared to sexually mature wild-type males which probably reflects the absence of negative feedback by testosterone in the mutant mice. consistent with this, esr <dig> expression was decreased by  <dig>  fold in the castrated kko mice that were give testosterone implants. in contrast, expression of the estrogen receptor beta  was  <dig>  fold lower in the gko mice independent of testosterone effects. esr <dig> function in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is currently unknown as hormonal feedback occurs almost entirely through the estrogen receptor alpha  <cit>  as supported in our study. this is the first report that esr <dig> may be regulated by kp and gpr <dig> 

previous studies have identified genes that show an up-regulation in the hypothalamus during mammalian puberty including eap <dig>   <cit> , oct <dig>  <cit>  and ttf <dig>   <cit> . the role of these genes as key regulators of pubertal initiation is not clear however. disruption of expression of these genes in the hypothalamus delays but does not prevent entry into puberty in contrast to loss of kp/gpr <dig> signaling which is associated with complete loss of puberty. we did not observe any difference in expression of these genes in our analysis suggesting that they may only facilitate puberty rather than act as essential regulators.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together our results reveal for the first time, using a genome-wide discovery approach, the complex network of gene regulation that is dependent on gpr <dig> and kisspeptin. we have identified from this network, transcripts whose regulation is strongly dependent on sex-steroid exposure and therefore likely to be a secondary consequence of sexual immaturity in these mutants. importantly, we have also identified novel transcripts, such as tmem <dig> whose regulation is independent of sex steroid exposure and are therefore prime candidates for direct involvement in the biology of kisspeptin and gpr <dig> regulation. future genetic and biochemical studies will determine the role of these genes in the gonadotropic axis.
