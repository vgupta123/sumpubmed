BACKGROUND
the role of ubiquitin in the regulation of cellular processes is ever expanding and has resulted in much research being focused upon the proteins which are responsible for the conjugation and removal of this moiety from proteins of interest. deubiquitinating enzymes are a large family of proteases that cleave ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and to date five families consisting of approximately  <dig> members have been identified including the ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases , the ubiquitin specific proteases , the machado-joseph disease protein domain proteases , the ovarian tumour proteases  and the jamm motif proteases  <cit> . the usps, of which the dub/usp <dig> subfamily are members, are the largest family consisting in humans of approximately  <dig> members  <cit> . they are cysteine proteases that are identified by two well conserved motifs known as the cys and his boxes essential for their catalytic activity  <cit> .

the dub/usp <dig> subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes were originally identified as immediate early genes induced in response to cytokine stimulation in both mice  and humans  <cit> . several lines of evidence also suggest that this family regulate cell growth and survival. dub- <dig> expression results in cell cycle arrest prior to s-phase  <cit>  and dub- <dig> expression can markedly inhibit apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal  <cit> . more recently, we have also reported that constitutive expression of dub- <dig> can block cell proliferation  <cit>  and subsequently we have demonstrated that this is due to its regulation of the ubiquitination and activity of the 'caax' box protease ras converting enzyme  <dig>   <cit> .

previous studies suggested that the murine genes originally identified were part of a head-to-tail repeat of dub/usp <dig> genes on mouse chromosome  <dig>  that had most likely resulted from a tandem duplication event  <cit> . in addition, it has also been reported that human usp <dig> is encoded as a  <dig> bp orf within rs <dig>  <cit> , a megasatellite repeat, originally identified as a  <dig> bp tandemly repeated sequence from human chromosome 4p <dig>  <cit>  and shown to be highly polymorphic with an estimated copy number range of  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the multiple repeat units on chromosome 4p <dig>  it had also been demonstrated that a limited number of repeat units are present on human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . previously, we interrogated the available sequence databases and identified multiple human orfs which indicated that several potential human members of this family existed  <cit> . in addition, we identified  <dig> rat orfs and one additional murine orf suggesting that the dub/usp <dig> family members were conserved through multiple species as part of a conserved tandemly repeated sequence  <cit> , something supported by the previous observation that rs <dig> recognises related sequences in a number of species  <cit> . in addition, we noted that each sequence showed more intra-species rather than inter-species homology suggesting that although the sequences in each species had originated from a common ancestor, expansion in the number of family members had occurred after the species had diverged  <cit> .

these previous studies indicated that the dub/usp <dig> proteases are an unusual family of genes incorporated into a sequence which has tandemly replicated in at least three separate species. however, this work was carried out prior to the establishment of a robust and complete human genome sequence and as a result a clear picture of the structure of these repeat units and how they have evolved was not possible. therefore, the refinement of the human genome sequence, as well as those of many other species, now gives us the opportunity to revisit this gene family to comprehensively analyse their distribution and evolution.

in this study we have identified and mapped  <dig> sequences from the current human genome reference build which are potential members of the dub/usp <dig> family. we have also identified and mapped  <dig> murine and  <dig> rat sequences from their respective genomes, as well as identifying multiple sequences from pan troglodytes , macaca mulatta , pongei abelii , canis familiarus  and bos taurus  which would appear to represent members of this protease family. in addition, we demonstrate that the previous assumption that these sequences have multiplied through tandem duplication is insufficient. in particular we show that the sequences on human chromosome  <dig> are actually embedded within the previously characterised beta-defensin cluster and that the copy number variation observed for these sequences may be associated with the variable copy number of this cluster. in addition, we show that whilst head to tail repeats are present in some species, this is not absolute. finally, when examining the relationships between the identified sequences it is again apparent that the sequences present in humans, mice, rats, cows and dogs have all been derived from a common ancestor which has replicated after these species have diverged. however, when the chimpanzee and human sequences are compared it would appear that there has been some duplication prior to their divergence.

RESULTS
identification and mapping of homo sapiens sequences
we searched the available databases for human genomic sequences which could represent members of the dub/usp <dig> family. then, concentrating on the current human genome assembly  we have identified and mapped all potential family members. thirty-two separate loci were found to represent potential members of this family on both chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . on chromosome 4p <dig>   we found two separate blocks of rs <dig> tandem repeats consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> copies respectively. closer examination revealed that these blocks were in fact separated by an assembly gap suggesting these sequences represent a portion of a single block of tandem repeats which has not been fully resolved due to its repetitive nature. on chromosome 8p <dig>   we identified  <dig> blocks of  <dig> rs <dig> repeat units. upon further analysis of the sequences on chromosome  <dig> we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences contained an intact orf of  <dig> bp equivalent to those previously identified   <cit>  and that the previously identified usp <dig> was one of the sequences present. on chromosome  <dig> we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences had intact orfs and that dub- <dig> was one of the sequences present.

we then carried out a clustal alignment of the proteins encoded by the intact orfs to determine if they were potentially functional deubiquitinating enzymes . three of the orfs from chromosome  <dig> lacked either the cysteine or the histidine residue required for catalytic activity  <cit>  and as a result will be non-functional .

we then took all of the sequences from both chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and created a phylogenetic tree to examine the relationship between these sequences  as well as examining the chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig>  sequences separately. the sequences within the two blocks of tandem repeats upon chromosome  <dig> were found to be closely related suggesting these have all arisen from one ancestral sequence which was present at this location and has subsequently been tandemly duplicated. however, the arrangement of sequences on chromosome  <dig> is more complex. although not completely definitive, the relationships between these sequences would suggest that the  <dig> blocks of  <dig> repeat units on chromosome  <dig> have resulted from the duplication of one of these blocks rather than the tandem duplication of individual sequences. this hypothesis was further supported when the sequences surrounding these blocks were examined . previously it has been shown that a number of the beta-defensin genes on chromosome 8p <dig>  exist as part of a cluster  <cit> . this cluster, which is made up of defb <dig>  defb <dig>  defb <dig>  defb <dig>  spag <dig>  defb <dig>  defb <dig>  defb <dig> and defb <dig> is surrounded by fam90a/olfactory receptor genes and has been shown to have a variable copy number ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  but more commonly between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . it would appear that two of the blocks of dub/usp <dig> repeats  are present within the  <dig> beta-defensin clusters which have previously been identified on the human genome reference assembly  <cit>  . the third block  is not within the recognised beta-defensin cluster which shows copy number variation, but is associated with a cluster of other beta-defensin, fam90a and olfactory receptor genes . this would suggest that although these blocks would appear to have been derived from a common ancestral block, the third block is not embedded within the copy number variable beta-defensin cluster. it is also interesting to note that there are  <dig> beta-defensin genes in close proximity to the tandemly repeated sequences on chromosome  <dig> as well as a number of olfactory receptor sequences .

identification and mapping of mus musculus sequences
as before, we searched the available databases for murine sequences which could represent members of the dub/usp <dig> family and concentrated on the murine genome reference assembly . seven separate loci representing potential members of this family on chromosome  <dig>  were identified . these sequences were found spread along this chromosome and whilst dub- <dig> and dub-1a represent head to tail repeat units, it would appear that the other sequences present are randomly spread throughout this region . upon closer examination we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences contained an intact orf equivalent to those previously identified in mice  <cit> , with all of these previously identified sequences being represented .

we then carried out a clustal alignment of the proteins encoded by the intact orfs and found that all of the key catalytic residues  necessary for activity  <cit>  were present and therefore they are all potentially functional.

next, we created a phylogenetic tree to examine the relationship between the sequences identified . the sequences were found to separate into two main branches. the first, consisting of dub- <dig>  dub-1a, dub <dig> and loc <dig>  were found reasonably close together upon chromosome  <dig>  however, the second consisting of dub- <dig>  dub-2a and loc <dig> lie on both sides of the former group of sequences. the differences between these two groups are further illustrated by the clustal alignment of the proteins produced by these intact orfs . towards the carboxy termini of all of these proteins there is a  <dig> amino acid sequence which is apparently duplicated. however, the members of the second branch  would appear to have undergone a further replication and now have three copies of the aforementioned sequence .

the surrounding sequence did not contain any beta-defensin-like sequences, but we did observe multiple olfactory receptors sequences surrounding these genes and clearly they are embedded in an area rich in olfactory receptor genes .

identification and mapping of rattus norvegicus sequences
the rattus norvegicus genome reference assembly  was searched to identify and map any potential dub/usp <dig> family members. three separate loci were found to represent sequences that are potential members of this family on chromosome  <dig>  . two of these sequences  represent head to tail repeat units, with the third being located some distance away . upon closer examination we found that all  <dig> of the sequences contained an intact orf.

a clustal alignment of the proteins encoded by these orfs demonstrated that whilst loc <dig> and rgd <dig> are potentially functional deubiquitinating enzymes, loc <dig> lacks the cysteine residue necessary for catalytic activity in these enzymes .

we then created a phylogenetic tree to examine the relationship between these rat sequences and the previously examined murine sequences . the sequences were found to separate into two distinct groups with sequences from within each species being more homologous. this was further illustrated by the clustal alignment , which showed that the sequence towards the carboxy termini of these proteins which we have previously found to be at least duplicated in the murine sequences, has only one copy present in all the rat sequences.

again, like the murine sequences, we found multiple olfactory receptor genes around the rat sequences suggesting they were again embedded in an area rich in olfactory receptors .

identification of other dub/usp <dig> family members
having identified and mapped the sequences from the human, mouse and rat genomes, we next went on to examine other species to determine if any contained dub/usp <dig> genes and we identified a number of species where sequences were present. in particular, we found  <dig> loci on canis lupus familiarus  chromosome  <dig>  that are split into  <dig> groups , although not head to tail repeats, and separated by approximately  <dig> mb. all of these have intact orfs and when aligned with other family members  they all appear to be potentially active as they contain all the essential catalytic residues. further examination did not reveal any beta-defensin or olfactory receptor genes within this region, but, we did find a number of un-annotated dub/usp <dig> sequences on dog chromosome  <dig>  in an area which is rich in olfactory receptor genes .

three loci were also found on bos taurus  chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig> of which are head to tail repeats  and  <dig> of which possess intact orfs . one was also found on chromosome  <dig>  . again, when aligned with other family members all the necessary catalytic residues were present . however, no beta-defensin or olfactory receptor sequences were found in the vicinity.

we also identified a sequence from equus caballus  chromosome  <dig>  as a potential dub/usp <dig> family member with a complete orf  with all residues necessary for catalytic activity intact. interestingly this gene was found in close proximity to a number of fam90a and defensin genes .

a phylogenetic tree to examine the relationship between the sequences from cow and dog as well as those of humans, mice and rats was then created . as before, these sequences showed more similarity to those of their own species than to those of other species suggesting that they have all evolved from a common ancestor and have been replicated post-speciation.

finally, we examined sequences from other primates and found  <dig> sequences in pan troglodytes  on chromosomes  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  that are potential dub/usp <dig> genes. however, only  <dig> of these contained intact orfs , and when these were aligned with other family members only  <dig> contained all the key residues necessary for catalytic activity  . we also identified  <dig> sequence from macaca mulatta  chromosome  <dig>   which had an intact orf and when we examined pongei abelii  we found several genomic clones from chromosome  <dig> which contain an unresolved tandem repeat equivalent to rs <dig>  indeed, we found one bac clone  which has more than  <dig> tandemly repeated copies, many of which contain intact orfs. when the predicted proteins from both of these were aligned with other family members they are intact and potentially active. we created a phylogenetic tree examining the relationship between the sequences from pan troglodytes and humans . unlike our previous comparisons, it was evident that the human and pan troglodytes sequences do not segregate and it would appear that there may well have been several common ancestral sequences prior to these two species separating. it is also interesting that the sequences from the different pan troglodytes chromosomes are spread between the different blocks of similarity, suggesting they may have resulted from the duplication of a block of sequences from one chromosome onto another, rather than the tandem duplication of a sequence once it has been transferred to that chromosome. this is similar to what is observed on human chromosome  <dig>  it is also interesting to note that we observed beta-defensin genes in close proximity to the sequences on pan troglodytes chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as well as macaca mulatta chromosome  <dig> .

discussion
previously we reported that the dub/usp <dig> family of deubiquitinating enzymes had multiple tandemly repeated family members on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in humans as well as on chromosome  <dig> in mice and that multiple family members were also present in rats  <cit> . this suggested that members of this family were present within a tandemly repeated sequence, which was conserved among these species and all the family members had resulted from one common ancestral sequence which had duplicated in each species after their separation  <cit> . in this current study, using the most current human genome assembly, we now show that our original assumptions insufficiently explained dub/usp <dig> evolution. in particular, we now show that in the most current human genome reference assembly there is a block of tandemly repeated sequences on chromosome  <dig> containing a minimum of  <dig> dub/usp <dig> sequences. furthermore, the  <dig> dub/usp <dig> sequences present on chromosome  <dig> are found in blocks of  <dig> repeats embedded within, in at least  <dig> cases, the copy number variable beta-defensin cluster. in addition, it is evident that whilst some of the family members in mice and rats may lie head to tail, there are not the same tandem repeat blocks seen on human chromosome  <dig>  in addition, we have now identified multiple additional sequences within chimpanzee , rhesus monkey , orang-utan , horse , cow  and dog  which also appear to represent members of this family of genes . again the relationship between the sequences observed in humans, mice, rats, cows and dogs would suggest the presence of one ancestral sequence which has been duplicated in all of these species independently. however, it would also appear from comparison of human and chimpanzee sequences that some duplication has taken place prior to their divergence.

the arrangement of the human family members would suggest that the variation in rs <dig> copy number, and as a result the number of dub/usp <dig> genes, may come about via two mechanisms. firstly, the presence of tandemly repeated sequences on human chromosome  <dig> would suggest that this sequence is susceptible to tandem duplication, something which is further illustrated by the tandem repeats observed in murine and rat sequences as well as the large unresolved tandem repeat on orang-utan chromosome  <dig>  secondly, the localisation of a block of three rs <dig> repeat units within both copies of the beta-defensin cluster, previously shown to be present in the current human genome assembly  <cit> , and to show copy number variation from  <dig> copies to  <dig>  <cit> , may well account for part of the variation in rs <dig> copy number previously observed. it is therefore likely that both of these blocks contribute to the differences in rs <dig> copy number. however, the presence of an assembly gap between the two blocks of repeats observed on chromosome  <dig> indicating this repeat is not fully resolved, as well as assembly gaps between the beta-defensin clusters on chromosome  <dig> would suggest the genome assemblies to date are rather tentative and preclude us from determining how much each block contributes to the variation in copy number.

the tentative nature of our observations also makes it difficult to determine which of these blocks may contain the ancestral sequence. it is interesting that all the sequences in the tandemly repeated blocks on chromosome  <dig> show little divergence and the majority retain an intact orf. this may well suggest this is a relatively recent evolutionary event, which has resulted from the transfer of dub/usp <dig> sequences from chromosome  <dig>  this conclusion is supported by the observation of a small number of beta-defensin and olfactory receptor sequences in close proximity to these tandem blocks as well as the observation that within all of the beta-defensin clusters,  <dig> of the  <dig> dub/usp <dig> genes lack either an intact orf or residues necessary for catalytic activity. although, it must be noted that the sequences which appear to lack the necessary active residues could also function as ubiquitin binding proteins or competitors for the active family members. in addition, the observation of dub/usp <dig> genes in association with beta-defensin, fam90a and olfactory receptor genes in multiple species including humans, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, mice, rats, horses and dogs would also support this hypothesis. this would also suggest that the ancestral dub/usp <dig> sequence may well have existed in close proximity to beta-defensin and olfactory receptor genes and that this family has evolved along with these sequences in the species outlined. however, no beta-defensin genes are found within the vicinity of the murine and rat dub/usp <dig> family members and syntenic regions to the beta-defensin clusters on human chromosome 8p <dig>  exist on murine chromosomes 8qa <dig> -a <dig> and 14qc <dig> as well as rat chromosomes 16q <dig>  and 15p <dig>  regions which are distinct to their dub/usp <dig> genes on murine chromosome  <dig> and rat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this could be explained by the observation that, in the different mammalian species a number of beta-defensin blocks have been identified, two of which are specific to rodents, and several of which show no overlap between humans and rodents  <cit> . therefore, the absence of the beta-defensin genes from the dub/usp <dig> region in rodents may be due to the evolutionary pressures which have prompted them to evolve a distinct beta-defensin repertoire from other mammals.

alternatively, the dub/usp <dig> sequences may be mobile genetic elements which are more readily inserted into areas of the genome which are unstable and therefore their frequent co-localisation with the olfactory receptor and beta-defensin genes is due to the nature of the areas into which they insert and not to any co-evolution. this is supported by the observation that the closest relatives of the dub/usp <dig> family, usp <dig> and usp <dig>  have much more complex genomic structures suggesting that the dub/usp <dig> family may not have resulted from gene duplication, but from the insertion of a mrna sequence into an unstable genomic region.

the defensins are cationic antimicrobial peptides which are produced by mucosal epithelial cells lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts and as such are thought to play an important role in immune defence  <cit> . the defensin genes on chromosome 8p <dig>  consist of a block of alpha-defensin genes and a copy number variable block of beta-defensin genes. only one of the alpha-defensins varies in copy number  due to its propensity for tandem duplication  <cit> . however, the entire beta-defensin cluster shows copy number variation  <cit>  and the presence of multiple and diverging copies of these genes may be important to boost host defence.

the olfactory receptors are often found as tandemly repeated sequences and there are approximately  <dig> apparently functional genes in humans, as well as an equivalent number of pseudogenes  <cit> . these genes are also proportionally over-represented at regions that show copy number variation as well as regions that show segmental duplications  <cit> . there should be positive selection to maintain a highly variable repertoire of olfactory receptors to allow the recognition of a wide array of odorant molecules, although it is apparent that primates have a smaller number of functional receptors in comparison to other mammals, possibly due to their acquisition of tri-chromatic vision  <cit> .

if the dub/usp <dig> genes have co-evolved with these genes it could suggest they are under similar evolutionary pressures to the beta-defensin and olfactory receptor genes. however, on the basis that they have not diverged significantly, that their repertoire has not spread beyond chromosomes  <dig> and 8; and that on chromosome  <dig> all but one dub/usp <dig> gene copy in each repeat block has been inactivated would collectively suggest this is not the case. indeed, it has been observed that in regions of copy number variation, which are inherently unstable, the selection pressures to get rid of unnecessary additional copies of the olfactory receptors and other genes are reduced, and this may well account for their over representation  <cit> . it is also interesting to note that each of the beta-defensin clusters maintains a dub/usp <dig> gene with an intact orf, suggesting there may be positive selection to maintain an active member in each repeat of this copy number variable repeat, especially, if as hypothesised, this is the ancestral sequence.

moreover, unlike the beta-defensins and olfactory receptors, the known function of the dub/usp <dig> family genes would suggest there should be no selective pressure for the acquisition of additional family members and as yet we have no experimental evidence that any of the intact orfs, other than dub- <dig> and usp <dig> are active. in fact, several lines of evidence suggest that the dub/usp <dig> family regulate cell growth and survival, processes which are controlled by delicately balanced systems which can be easily disrupted and would not benefit from additional gene expression. in particular, dub- <dig> expression results in cell cycle arrest prior to s-phase  <cit> , dub- <dig> expression markedly inhibits apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal  <cit>  and we have previously reported that constitutive expression of dub- <dig> blocks cell proliferation  <cit>  through its regulation of the ubiquitination and activity of the 'caax' box protease rce <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it has also been observed that overexpression of usp <dig> family members can lead to apoptosis  <cit>  and most recently it has been reported that dub- <dig> regulates the ubiquitination and stability of cdc25a and thereby the progression of the cell cycle  <cit> . indeed, previous studies of rs <dig> would suggest mechanisms are present to regulate the transcript levels of dub/usp <dig> genes. in particular, previous studies have indicated that cosmid vectors containing significantly different copy numbers of the rs <dig> repeat may produce similar levels of dub/usp <dig> protein due to the production of anti-sense transcripts  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that some copies of the rs <dig> sequence can be methylated  <cit> . therefore, it is probable that the expression of the dub/usp <dig> genes is tightly controlled and their existence within a highly polymorphic sequence is not so much a reflection of the selective evolutionary pressures on these genes, but a consequence of the unstable and copy number variable region of the genome in which they have evolved.

however, having now established that each copy of the copy number variable beta-defensin cluster contains a block of dub/usp <dig> sequences using the current human genome build, it would also be interesting to examine the association of their copy number with immune related diseases. previously, it has been demonstrated that higher copy numbers of this cluster are associated with protection against crohn's disease  <cit> , something which was hypothesised to result from the increased barrier to infection resulting from over production of the beta-defensins. in addition, higher copy numbers have also been associated with an increased risk of psoriasis  <cit> . the dub/usp <dig> family members are cytokine induced genes  <cit>  which will be expressed in many immune cell types and could modulate the immune response. therefore, their presence within this cluster could be related to its association with these immune related diseases. as a result, it may be informative to examine the overall copy number of these genes and see if there is any association with these diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
our observations suggest that the dub/usp <dig> family of enzymes have evolved from an ancestral sequence which was part of an unstable part of the genome and as a result, it has undergone multiple and varied duplications independently in all of the species examined. however, there is strong conservation of this family throughout these species, probably due to their important role in regulation of cell fate  <cit> . it will be intriguing to determine the importance of these highly polymorphic genes in diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer where copy number variation of the region in which they are embedded has already been shown to be important  <cit> .
