BACKGROUND
considerable evidence indicates a crucial role of acetylcholine -mediated transmission in learning and memory. impairment of cholinergic signalling contributes to cognitive deficits in animal models  <cit>  and diseases such as schizophrenia and alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . conversely, drugs that augment cholinergic transmission  have been shown to improve certain cognitive functions  <cit> . in this context metabotropic ach receptors, termed muscarinic ach receptors   <cit>  play a crucial role. five machr subtypes have been cloned ; each consisting of seven highly conserved transmembranal segments. a large and more variable intracellular domain  <cit>  couples the receptor to second messengers and ion channels via heterotrimeric g-proteins  <cit> .

the machrs are now recognized as key targets for the treatment of different neuropathologies such as alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and parkinson’s disease  <cit> . in particular, agonists of m <dig> machr or antagonists at m <dig> or m <dig> machrs are promising substances  <cit> .

however, the similarity in ligand-binding sites between machr subtypes, the paucity of selective agonists/antagonists as well as the expression of different subtypes of machrs in a given area constitute major obstacles to delineate cellular effects of a given subtype  <cit> . the improvement of therapeutic approaches using specific machr modulators is further impeded by a lack of established and validated protocol to screen efficacy of different machr agonist/antagonist at native receptors in neocortical slices. characterization of receptors in a native system is a crucial issue. for instance, at d2-type dopamine receptors  <cit>  or ampa receptors  <cit> , the pharmacology at recombinant receptors critically depends on the experimental conditions. thus, the pharmacology of machr in heterologous systems may not necessarily relate to the natively expressed machr  <cit> . therefore, to delineate the pharmacology of machrs in the neocortex, the data must be obtained in the native neocortical slice.

we tried to define simple paradigms to quantify routinely the efficacy of different machr agonists. this should facilitate further screening for novel drugs in the neocortex. we investigated the effects of cch and various machr antagonists on several parameters of neuronal excitability and the synaptic transmission in neocortical layer ii/iii. we have chosen layer ii/iii of neocortex because of the established expression of m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> but not m <dig> and m <dig> machrs at the mrna  <cit>  and the protein levels  <cit> .

as a first step we tested whether the published effects obtained under various experimental conditions can be reproduced. firstly, in neocortical pyramidal neurones, ach or the prototype cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine-chloride  depolarizes the membrane potential and increases action potential  firing  <cit> . secondly, cch reduces excitatory postsynaptic potentials  in neocortical neurons  <cit> . this depressant effect was reduced by the preferential m1/m <dig> and m2/m <dig> machrs antagonists  and was not due to activation of nicotinic receptors  <cit> . thirdly, ach reduces the gaba release in neocortex via activation of m <dig> machr and to a smaller extent by activation of m <dig> machr  <cit> .

here we show that these  <dig> effects are mediated by  <dig> different subtypes of machrs allowing screening for machrs subtype-specific agonists/antagonists.

RESULTS
modulation of neuronal properties and firing behaviour
in control conditions, neurones had a resting membrane potential  of − <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, an input resistance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mΩ and the ap amplitudes averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . the slope of neuronal ap firing was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na in control conditions.

effects of cch on membrane properties and neuronal firing
bath application of cch had no effect on em  or ap amplitudes . however, cch consistently increased the neuronal input resistance . during cch application a given current injection elicited more aps . the slope of neuronal firing averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na in control and increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na in the presence of cch , much more than anticipated from the increase in membrane resistance. the reversibility of cch effect on slope of neuronal aps firing was by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % after washout . the sub-rheobase for ap generation was significantly decreased during perfusion with cch .

pharmacological delineation of the machr subtypes involved
atropine  or pirenzepine  reversed the cch-induced increase of slope of neuronal firing . this antagonism was almost complete and indistinguishable from the reversibility observed after washout . however, afdx did not reverse the cch-induced increase of slope of neuronal firing . in fact, the antagonism observed with afdx  was much smaller than the reversibility observed after washout . in the continuous presence of cch, the antagonism observed during a co-application of “pirenzepine + afdx”  was not different to that obtained during application of pirenzepine alone . this suggests that the slight antagonism observed during application of afdx alone is due to some antagonistic effect of afdx on m <dig> machr.

the slope of neuronal firing during application of cch in atropine-containing  or pirenzepine-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid   is significantly smaller than that obtained during application of cch in standard acsf . however, the slope of neuronal firing during application of cch added to an afdx-containing acsf  is not different to that obtained during application of cch in standard acsf , i.e. afdx fails to modify the cch-induced effects on firing. to further test the involvement of m <dig> machr in the effects on firing, we applied xanomeline, a m1/m <dig> preferring machrs agonist  <cit> . xanomeline increased the slope of neuronal firing from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na .

together these data suggest that cch exerts its action on slope of neuronal firing via machrs, and in particular m <dig> but not m <dig> or m <dig> machrs.

cch-induced increase of neuronal firing is mimicked by m-current blockade
to test the involvement of kv <dig> channels blockade  <cit>  in the m <dig> machr-mediated increase of neuronal firing, we applied linopirdine , a blocker of kv <dig> channels  <cit> . bath application of linopirdine had no effect on ap amplitudes  or on em  as expected since kv <dig> channels are not activated at − <dig> mv  <cit> . however, linopirdine increased the neuronal input resistance .

linopirdine increased significantly the number of aps at each current magnitude . consequently, the slope was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na in control and increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na in the presence of linopirdine . the sub-rheobase for ap generation was strongly decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na in the presence of linopirdine .

bath application of retigabine , an activator of kv <dig> channels  <cit> , had no effect on ap amplitudes , on em , or on neuronal input resistance . retigabine decreased significantly the number of aps at each current magnitude . consequently, the slope was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na in control and decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  aps/na in the presence of retigabine . the sub-rheobase for ap generation was increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na in control to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na in the presence of retigabine .

modulation of gabaergic transmission
cch decreases the paired-pulse inhibition of field potentials
paired-pulse protocols are often used to study gabaergic inhibition in field potentials  <cit> . we therefore employed a paired-pulse protocol as a first step towards studying cch modulation of inhibition.

the input–output curves obtained in itrc  were qualitatively similar to that obtained in strc, except for larger amplitudes of potentials , as expected  <cit> . the amplitude of the field potentials decreased significantly in the presence of cch  at stimulus intensities larger than  <dig>  ma .

this cch-induced synaptic depression was antagonized by atropine . pirenzepine  and afdx  at least partially reversed the cch-induced depression. linopirdine  and retigabine  had no effect on synaptic transmission .

paired-pulse stimulations  were used to determine the magnitude of paired-pulse depression of the second field potentials . since the apparent time-to-peak of the intracellular gabaa-mediated response is about 20– <dig> ms  <cit> , we focus here on the results obtained for interpulse intervals of 10– <dig> ms to investigate gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition. a high stimulus intensity  was used to maximally activate gabaergic transmission. when two pulses were delivered  <dig> ms apart, the mean amplitude of the fp <dig> was  <dig> ± 4% of the amplitude of the first .

cch  decreased slightly the amplitude of fp <dig> , whereas the amplitude of fp <dig> increased strongly  for an interpulse interval of  <dig> ms . this resulted in an increase of the paired-pulse ratio  which was significant for interstimulus intervals from  <dig> ms to  <dig> ms .

cch decreases the paired-pulse inhibition via machrs
at interpulse intervals between  <dig> and  <dig> ms, both atropine  and afdx  antagonized the cch-induced increase in ppr. in contrast, the cch-induced increase of the ppr at these interstimulus intervals was unaltered by addition of pirenzepine . conversely, application of afdx  or atropine  prevented the cch-induced increase of ppr , whereas pirenzepine failed to prevent this cch-induced increase of ppr .

application of linopirdine had no effect on the ppr  suggesting that the m-current blockade is not involved in the cch-induced increase of ppr. additionally, we verified that retigabine  did not alter the ppr . this suggests that modulation of gaba release, underlying the paired-pulse depression, is dominated by m <dig> machr effects. to further rule out the involvement of m1/m <dig> machrs in the depression of inhibition, we applied xanomeline. xanomeline did not alter the ppr .

cch decreases inhibitory synaptic conductances via m <dig> machr
to more directly evaluate the effects of machrs on synaptic inhibition, we evaluated the synaptic conductances underlying the ipspa and ipspb in the presence of various machr related compounds. application of cch greatly reduced the amplitudes of both, ipspa and ipspb components . estimating the underlying conductances  revealed substantial decreases; gipsp-a decreased from  <dig> ±  <dig> ns to  <dig> ±  <dig> ns, gipsp-b decreased from  <dig> ±  <dig> ns to  <dig> ±  <dig> ns, i.e. by  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . to evaluate which subtypes of machrs are involved in this modulation of inhibition we first tested the m2/m <dig> machrs antagonist afdx in the presence of cch. in these neurones, cch virtually abolished the conductances of both ipsps . application of afdx caused a considerable reversal in the depression of inhibition recovering to  <dig> and 72% of the control values .

next we tested the effects of the m1/m <dig> machrs antagonist pirenzepine. application of cch considerably reduced the synaptic conductances, gipsp-a from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns, gipsp-b from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns i.e. on average by  <dig> and 48%. on addition of pirenzepine, the depression of inhibitory conductances was essentially unaltered .

to further substantiate our hypothesis of a m <dig> machr-mediated depression of inhibition, we next tested xanomeline to evaluate possible effects of m <dig> or m <dig> machrs. application of xanomeline  had no consistent effect on em or rm . these neurones exhibited the usual alteration of slope of firing  and the depression of epsp amplitudes . yet, the gipsp-a and gipsp-b were unaltered . addition of  <dig> μm cch in the presence of xanomeline had no further effect on em or rm  but greatly reduced both inhibitory conductances, gipsp-a decreased to  <dig> ±  <dig> ns and gipsp-b to  <dig> ±  <dig> ns, i.e. by  <dig>  and  <dig> %, close to the values obtained for cch alone. the difference to control was significant for gipsp-b , but just not significant for the gipsp-a .

modulation of glutamatergic transmission
effects of carbachol on excitatory synaptic transmission: field potentials and intracellular recordings
in control acsf, the amplitudes of epsp and field potentials increased progressively with increasing stimulus intensities to reach a plateau . application of cch  decreased the amplitude of both epsp  and field potentials  in a similar range of stimulus intensities.

the input–output curves of epsp were well fitted by the boltzmann equation yielding a maximal epsp amplitude  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, a half maximal stimulus intensity  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  v and a slope factor of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . cch significantly decreased epspmax to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv and increased both i <dig> and slope factor to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  v and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively , i.e. the curve became more shallow and i <dig> shifted to higher values.

the depression of field potentials by cch  was completely reversible , whereas that of epsps  was partially reversible after washout. the epspmax recovered on average by  <dig> ± 11% after washout , whereas the effects on i <dig> and slope factor were completely reversible .

cch-induced depression of synaptic responses is due to activation of machrs
atropine  alone had no effect on the amplitude of epsp or field potentials at all stimulus intensities . also, i <dig> or slope factor were unaffected by atropine , indicating no obvious steady state modulation of synaptic responses by endogeneous machrs. pre-application of atropine prevented the cch-induced decrease of epspmax as well as the cch-induced increase of i <dig> and slope factor . conversely, addition of atropine fully reversed the cch-induced decrease of epspmax and field potential amplitude . the cch-induced increase of i <dig> and slope factor were also reversed . this suggests that the cch effects on excitatory synaptic transmission are mediated by activation of machrs.

the cch-induced depression of synaptic responses is sensitive to pirenzepine and afdx
applied alone, neither pirenzepine  nor afdx  had detectable effects on the epsp amplitude, i <dig> or slope factor of the input–output curve .

application of pirenzepine in the presence of cch antagonized the cch-induced decrease of epspmax . pirenzepine also antagonized the increase of slope factor  and reduced the increase of i <dig> . application of pirenzepine prior to cch, however, failed to prevent the cch-induced decrease of epspmax . in fact, cch added to a pirenzepine-containing acsf depressed the epspmax to  <dig> ± 6% of control , indistinguishable from the depression observed with cch alone . this failure of pirenzepine to prevent a cch-induced depression, when applied before cch, is in sharp contrast to the pirenzepine effect on neuronal firing, where pirenzepine is effective irrespective of the sequence of application.

application of afdx in the presence of cch partly antagonized the cch-induced decrease of the epspmax . afdx did not antagonize the effect on i <dig> or slope factor . also, application of afdx before addition of cch prevented the depressant effect of cch on epspmax. indeed, the epspmax in the presence of afdx + cch was not different from that measured in the control condition . pre-application of afdx also prevented the cch-induced increase of i <dig>  but not the increase of slope factor . to further determine which subtype of machr mediates the effects of cch on epsp, we applied xanomeline. xanomeline decreased the epspmax from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv .

cch-induced depression of synaptic responses is not mimicked by m-current blockade
linopirdine had no effect on the amplitude of the field potentials  the amplitude of epsp . this effect was only present at higher stimulus intensities . linopirdine had no effect on the slope factor but slightly reduced i <dig> . retigabine  had no effect on the maximal amplitude of the field potentials , on epspmax , or the slope factor  . however, retigabine increased i <dig> . these data suggest that cch–induced depression of maximal field potentials and epspmax are mediated by machrs not coupled to kv <dig> channels.

discussion
the key findings of this study are:  activation of m <dig> machr increased the neuronal ap firing via blockade of m-current,  activation of m <dig> machr increased the paired-pulse ratio of field potentials and decreased both components of gabaergic inhibition, and  activation of m <dig> machr depressed glutamatergic transmission presumably via activation of presynaptic receptors.

methodological aspects
the previous studies investigating the machrs in slice preparations used either sharp microelectrode recordings  <cit>  or whole cell patch clamp recordings  <cit> . the latter disturb the intracellular milieu and a massive rundown of m-current  was observed  <cit> , precluding a reliable pharmacology. intracellular recordings in cortical slices with sharp microelectrodes hence present a valuable method to quantify the effects at native machrs in slices.

however, reports in the neocortex focussed on the role of machrs or m-current either on the neuronal firing  <cit> , on the gabaergic transmission  <cit>  or on the glutamatergic transmission  <cit> . only few studies in cortex e.g.  <cit>  or in hippocampus e.g.  <cit>  investigated the role of machrs on both neuronal firing and synaptic transmission. the comparison of data obtained in different preparations using different experimental conditions is problematic, though. therefore, in the present study we investigated the  <dig> aspects, namely change of firing, depression of epsps and of ipsps, in the same preparation under identical experimental conditions.

although some authors used different concentrations of machrs agonists/antagonists, only one or few stimulus intensities e.g.  <cit>  or current injections e.g.  <cit>  were used. therefore, the results were mostly qualitative from a physiological point of view, precluding quantitative comparisons of different agonists/antagonists.

effect of machr activation on neuronal excitability
the consistent increase in the slope of neuronal firing by cch in the somatosensory cortex is similar to the hippocampus  <cit>  and the nucleus gracilis  <cit> . however, our determination of slope and intercept provides a more quantitative analysis of changes of firing compared to previous observations  <cit> . in particular, these authors compared the neuronal firing in response to a single current intensity before and during substance application. the interpretation of such data would be complicated by concomitant alterations of membrane potential and/or neuronal input resistance.

in any case, alterations of firing are mediated by machrs, as evidenced by the antagonism by atropine. moreover, the antagonism by pirenzepine  but not by afdx  further suggests an effect via m <dig> machr, similar to the m <dig> machr-mediated repetitive spontaneous neuronal firing observed in rat prefrontal cortex  <cit> . our conclusion is in line with previous data indicating that ach application increases the neuronal firing of neocortical pyramidal neurones in mice lacking m <dig> or m <dig> machrs but not in mice lacking m <dig> machr, confirming further an involvement of the m <dig> machr in this effect  <cit> .

the cellular mechanisms underlying the cch-induced increase of ap firing can be inferred from the effect of linopirdine which is an established blocker of kv <dig> channels  <cit> . linopirdine increased the neuronal firing as in hippocampus  <cit>  and entorhinal cortex  <cit> . together, these data indicate a m <dig> machr mediated depression of m-current  <cit>  as the underlying mechanism of cch-induced firing increase.

effect of machr activation on gabaergic transmission
we studied the machr mediated effect on neurotransmitter release by using the paired-pulse protocol with field potentials. cch increased the ppr for interpulse intervals ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ms. this suggests that the cch effect involves both gabaa and gabab receptor-mediated effects. the cch-induced increase of the ppr is most likely due to machr-mediated depression of gaba release  <cit> , and evoked ipscs  <cit> , during the first stimulus. normally, gaba would attenuate the response to a second stimulus by decreasing release via presynaptic gabab receptors  <cit> . hence a machr-mediated depression of gaba release might contribute to the altered paired pulse properties of synaptic responses.

the involvement of m <dig> machr in the cch-induced depression of gaba release underlying increase of ppr can be inferred from the antagonism by afdx  and lack of antagonism by pirenzepine . similar to the pharmacology at m <dig> machr, the effects of atropine and afdx on this m <dig> machr-mediated increase of ppr were identical whether the antagonist was applied in the presence of, or before, cch.

further evidence was obtained by evaluating the alterations in inhibitory conductance mediated by gabaa and gabab receptors. firstly, the similarity in the depression of both gipsp-a and gipsp-b, indicates a common denominator for both effects i.e. depression of gaba release. the effects of the selected compounds revealed which machr is involved in this depression of gaba release. the cch effects were considerably antagonized by the m2/m <dig> machrs antagonist afdx but slightly by the m1/m <dig> machrs antagonist pirenzepine. moreover, the m1/m <dig> machrs agonist xanomeline had no effects on gipsp-a or gipsp-b, yet subsequent addition of cch reduced gipsp-a and gipsp. this observation strongly suggests that neither m <dig> nor m <dig> machrs are involved in the modulation of gaba release. together these data support our view that m <dig> machr are involved in the modulation of gaba release.

this view is also supported by histological data. m <dig> machrs are predominantly localized at presynaptic axons of gabaergic neurones and are associated with asymmetric as well as symmetric cortical synapses  <cit> , suggesting that m <dig> machr can modulate gaba release in the neocortex. in addition, m <dig> machrs are mainly expressed on cortical pyramidal neurones rather than by gabaergic neurones  <cit> .

ach reduces the gaba release in neocortex by two separate mechanisms i) by decreasing ca2+ currents via activation of a m <dig> machr/pi3k/ca2+-independent pkc pathway and to a smaller extent by activation of a m <dig> machr/plc/ca2+-dependent pkc pathway  <cit> . this combination might explain the relatively large contribution of the m <dig> machr and the absence of detectable effects of the m <dig> machr in the cch-induced increase of ppr observed here.

effect of machr activation on glutamatergic transmission
our observation of cch decreasing the amplitudes of evoked synaptic potentials is in line with a wealth of evidence from various areas of the rodent brain  <cit> . both field potentials and intracellularly recorded epsps were depressed by cch to a similar degree. considering the marginal changes in em, this decrease cannot be accounted for by a membrane depolarization, confirming results obtained in entorhinal cortex  <cit> . these authors reported that the depression of synaptic transmission persisted when neurones were returned to their initial resting potential. however, previous observations in hippocampus e.g.  <cit>  or neocortex e.g.  <cit>  compared the synaptic response following a single stimulus intensity before and during substance application. our determination of i <dig>  epspmax and slope factor provide a more quantitative analysis of changes of synaptic transmission, corroborating and extending previous findings. in particular, the consistent effects over a wide range of stimulus intensities exclude the possibility of threshold phenomena.

our data indicate that this cch-induced depression of epsp is 1) fully prevented when cch is applied in the presence of atropine or afdx and 2) only partially prevented when cch was applied in the presence of pirenzepine. this corroborates and extends previous data from layer v of the somatosensory cortex  <cit> . unlike these authors, applying cch in the presence of antagonists, we also applied the machrs antagonists in the presence of cch, revealing marked differences with different sequence of application. the cch-mediated depression of epsp was fully reversed when pirenzepine or atropine was added in the presence of cch, i.e. pirenzepine is more effective when applied in the presence of the agonist. afdx, however, only partially reversed this depression, i.e. is less effective when applied in the presence of the agonist. this peculiarity may contribute to the discrepancies between previous reports. usually, the authors have either applied the antagonist in the presence of agonist or vice versa, the agonist in the presence of antagonists. to the best of our knowledge, the two complementary protocols had not been used in the same study so far e.g. either addition or pre-application was used, see  <cit> .

we propose that pirenzepine, a m1/m <dig> prefering machrs antagonist  <cit> , affects the epsp amplitude via m <dig> machr for the following reasons:

1) the increase of neuronal firing by cch was prevented and reversed by pirenzepine. however, the decrease of epspmax by cch was reversed but not prevented by pirenzepine. this difference may suggest that the pirenzepine-sensitive effects on epspmax and on slope of neuronal firing are mediated by two distinct machrs, i.e. the pirenzepine-sensitive effect on epspmax is not mediated by m <dig> machr.

2) only m <dig> and m <dig> machrs  are coupled to g-proteins gi/go family involved in the inhibition of neurotransmitter release  <cit> . in addition, recent evidence indicates that m <dig> machr is the major machr subtype responsible for direct cholinergic modulation of epsp  <cit> . therefore, the pirenzepine effect on cch-induced epsp depression is probably due to an action of pirenzepine on m <dig> rather than m <dig> machrs  <cit> . this view is supported by immunohistochemical data  <cit> , showing that cortical m <dig> machrs are located exclusively at postsynaptic sites.

3) the effects of atropine and afdx on the m <dig> machr-mediated increase of ppr were identical regardless of the sequence of application. however, the effects of pirenzepine and afdx on the cch-induced decrease of epsp were different whether this antagonist is applied in the presence or before the cch application. this difference may suggest that the cch-induced decrease of epspmax and increase of ppr are mediated by two distinct machrs, i.e. the cch-induced decrease of epspmax is not mediated by m <dig> machr. moreover, the increase of ppr by cch  was not prevented or reversed by pirenzepine. this suggests that pirenzepine is not active at m <dig> machr in our conditions.

4) afdx applied before cch or pirenzepine applied in the presence of cch can both fully prevent and reverse, respectively, the cch-induced depression of epspmax. the similar potency of pirenzepine and afdx on cch-induced epspmax depression therefore suggests an involvement of m <dig> machr as the most parsimonious explanation.

cholinergic transmission and cognition
ample evidence suggests that machr-mediated signalling in the cortex is critical for learning and memory, yet the mechanisms of ach facilitating cognitive processes remained elusive. the effects reported here, namely the depression of epsp and the increased neuronal firing mediated by different machrs would provide a very interesting system for “attention” at the cellular level. the m <dig> machr-mediated depression of epsp reduces the noise of ongoing synaptic activity while the m <dig> machr-mediated increase of neuronal firing augments the neuronal response to a given synaptic input, i.e. these two effects would improve the signal to noise ratio. moreover, the shallower input–output curve of synaptic responses induced by m <dig> machr observed here extends the subthreshold range for temporal summation, which is augmented by a cch-induced reduction of kir-type potassium current  <cit> . in addition, the cholinergic depression of gaba release corresponds to a depression of inhibition by higher frequencies of stimulation  <cit>  implicated in long-term potentiation  <cit> . together, these data corroborate and extend a theoretical framework proposed by hasselmo and mcgaughy  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide evidence that the triade of cellular cch effects are mediated by three subtypes of machr, i) m <dig> machr-mediated increase of firing, ii) m <dig> machr-mediated depression of gaba release and iii) m <dig> machr-mediated depression of glutamatergic synaptic responses. activation of these effects by physiologically released ach provides an interesting combination of neuronal attention and facilitation of ltp. in addition, the three parameters delineated here may present useful tools to test new m <dig>  m <dig> or m <dig> machrs modulators at native receptors in the human neocortex from epilepsy surgery tissues.
