BACKGROUND
secreted extracellular matrix proteins, purified from the engelbreth-holm-swarm  tumour, such as matrigel™ and geltrex™, are widely used in a variety of cell culture applications  <cit> , including the support of primary cell propagation, and anchorage-dependent cell differentiation. these cell differentiation assays include the morphogenesis of endothelial cells  into tube-like structures  for the study of in vitro angiogenesis  <cit> , and the differentiation of neural cells in neurite outgrowth assays  <cit> .

the most common assay employed using basement matrix is the ec tube formation assay, thought to represent the differentiation stage of angiogenesis and often being applied as a first-pass screening assay of compounds with potential pro- or anti-angiogenic properties . to study cell differentiation, a relatively large volume of matrix is usually indicated with recommendations and common usage of matrix in the order of 50- <dig> μl/cm <dig>  depending upon the assay to be employed. as well as increasing the general cost associated with performing these assays this volume of matrix also precludes the use of experimental techniques such as high-resolution/single cell microscopy and requires further cell manipulation   <cit>  in order to extract mrna for subsequent gene expression analysis. in an attempt to solve these issues we sought to develop a thin layer angiogenesis assay  that would retain the ability to act as an anchoring and differentiating platform, but could also be used for high definition single cell imaging. here, we show that spreading low volumes of geltrex™ basement membrane thinly onto glass or tissue culture plastic enables the use of high-resolution imaging and direct rna extraction from endothelial cells that are actively engaged in the tube-forming process. this simple assay generates comparable data to those derived from large volume matrix assays, and has a far greater utility in terms of imaging and transcriptional analysis accompanied by a 25– <dig> fold reduction in relative cost.

RESULTS
the human endothelial cell line  and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells  undergo differentiation on a thin layer matrix
 <dig> μl of growth factor-reduced geltrex™ basement matrix was spread evenly onto glass  using a sterile syringe insert. huvec or ea.hy <dig> formed tube-like structures under non-stimulated conditions  and the number of tubes formed was significantly increased in response to the distinct angiogenesis inducers vascular endothelial growth factor  and gw <dig> , a selective pparβ/δ agonist  <cit>  . similar results were obtained when geltrex™ matrix was spread directly onto tissue culture plastic with vegf-stimulated huvec showing a clear pro-angiogenic response .figure  <dig>

an advantage of the traditional angiogenesis assay is scalability, with many research groups performing the assay in a 96-well plate format using  <dig> μl/well of basement matrix  <cit> . to determine if this higher throughput can be achieved with the tla assay, huvec  were seeded on  <dig> μl of geltrex™ basement matrix in the presence of vegf  or gw <dig> . these experiments showed that responses to vegf and gw <dig> using the tla in 96-well plate format  were identical to those measured using the coverslip tla approach .figure  <dig>

a common goal for those routinely using the basement matrix assay for assessing angiogenic potential is the use of automated quantification systems. the use of an automated quantification system  provides qualitatively but not always quantitatively identical data to manual counting .figure  <dig>

the tla approach is qualitatively similar to the traditional thick layer approach
to make a direct comparison of the tla approach with the traditional thick layer, huvec were stimulated to undergo tubulogenesis in the presence or absence of vegf  on either  <dig> μl/well or  <dig> μl/well of geltrex™ in a 96-well format. vegf induced a similar pro-angiogenic effect on huvec whether on a standard thick or tla basement matrix .figure  <dig>

differential interference contrast  and confocal microscopy of differentiated endothelial cells
unlike cell monolayers, the traditional tube formation assay with its large matrix volume has greatly reduced microscopic working distances, making single cell analysis highly challenging. using huvec stimulated with vegf  in  <dig> mm glass-bottom plates coated with  <dig> μl of geltrex™, differential interference contrast  images were acquired using a zeiss axiovert  <dig> microscope . as shown in figure 6a the tla is clearly compatible with use of this high contrast technique.figure  <dig>

as proof-of-principle for live single cell and confocal imaging we chose the well-established mitochondrial-specific dye mitotracker  <cit> . vegf-stimulated huvec  were incubated for  <dig> min with mitotracker green . live mitochondrial dynamics  were recorded within the tube-like structures . in addition to single cell-live imaging, the 3d mitochondrial network in differentiated endothelial cells was reconstructed following z-stack deconvolution  using a leica sp <dig> confocal microscope .

to demonstrate confocal imaging of fixed cells, huvec differentiated using the tla approach in chamber slides  were fixed with 4% pfa and stained for the common endothelial cell marker cd <dig>  .figure  <dig>

direct rna extraction from huvec in the tla assay for use in rt-qpcr
total rna was extracted from huvec differentiated into tubes using the tla assay following exposure to vegf  without prior cell isolation according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol . subsequent standard rt-qpcr analysis readily detected gapdh and cox- <dig> expression . cox- <dig> expression in the tla was not significantly induced relative to gapdh at  <dig> h in vegf stimulated tube-forming huvec .figure  <dig>

discussion
the use of a basement matrix in the study of anchorage-dependent differentiation is common place in many research laboratories, with the endothelial cell tube formation assay being the most widely used in vitro assay for the study of angiogenesis. the smallest volume of matrix used in this assay to date is  <dig> μl/cm <dig>   <cit>  which is more cost effective than the recommended volume of  <dig> μl/cm <dig>  but created a meniscus that promoted cell pooling  <cit> . in theory, if the matrix layer becomes thin enough, significant meniscus formation and subsequent cell pooling would be overcome. here, we demonstrate that the use of as little as  <dig> μl/cm <dig>  is sufficient to support the anchorage-dependent differentiation of endothelial cells into tube-like structures without meniscus formation and cell pooling. using this thin layer approach we demonstrate that the assay can be reproducibly performed on glass or on plastic and that quantification of tube-forming capacity shows the expected pro-angiogenic responses to vegf and the pparβ/δ agonist gw <dig> , consistent with published data from our and other laboratories using a traditional matrix volume  <cit>  and re-confirmed in side-by-side comparisons in this paper . moreover, the tla method may provide a platform for more stable tube formation with less network breakdown . the reason for this is not clear but may represent a further potential advantage over the traditional thick layer approach.

a common problem with the standard assay is its compatibility with automated analysis systems due to loss of focus, predominantly as a consequence of meniscus formation. with the tla method reducing meniscus formation we sought to identify if automated analysis using the imagej angiogenesis analyzer freeware was compatible with this thin layer approach. automated analysis was qualitatively  similar to manual counting , and can therefore  be readily applied to the tla method.

an additional benefit of using the tla assay in a 24-well format is the ability to directly extract mrna from the tube-forming cells for gene expression analysis. traditionally, due to the large volume of gel present this has been achieved by isolating the cells from the matrix  which requires subjecting the cells to additional chemical treatment and centrifugation  <cit> . accordingly, most studies investigate gene expression in endothelial cell monolayers and correlate the results with outcomes from the functional tube formation assay  <cit> . with the highly reduced gel volume, the tla approach presented here negates the need for cell detachment from the matrix, thus allowing direct extraction of rna from cells which are undergoing or have completed tubulogenesis. this modification therefore makes the molecular analysis less time-consuming as well as circumventing the difficulties associated with extrapolating between data derived from cell monolayers versus differentiating endothelial cells. the ability to increase throughput is an advantage for any assay, particularly when it may be desirable to screen the effects of a number of different compounds. in this respect we show that the tla methodology can be used in a higher throughput format in 96-well plates using  <dig> μl of matrix/well .

the ability to obtain high-resolution images from a convenient low-cost in vitro assay is highly desirable. we show here that one of the advantages of the tla assay with its greatly reduced working distances is the use of high-resolution microscopy, including dic and confocal, that allows a more accessible means of studying cellular and intracellular processes, demonstrated here by the immunofluorescent staining of cd <dig>  moreover, with the growing interest in the role played by cell organelles such as the mitochondria in the angiogenic process  <cit> , we have successfully monitored the mitochondrial network and dynamics during endothelial cell tubulogenesis. to our knowledge we are the first to show such high-resolution images of live mitochondria within developing tubules.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of a basement matrix in the study of anchorage-dependent differentiation is common place in many research laboratories, with the endothelial cell tube formation assay being the most widely used in vitro assay for investigating the angiogenic functions of endothelial cells. current recommended matrix volumes make this an expensive assay, preclude the use of more advanced imaging techniques, and limit the ease with which molecular data can be acquired. we have described a modified method for this basement matrix assay which provides all the necessary support required for differentiation, generating results which are similar to those obtained using the traditional approach. in conclusion, our thin layer angiogenesis assay makes for the ideal first-pass angiogenesis screening assay with a substantially lowered cost  compared to commonly used similar in vitro angiogenesis assays, whilst at the same time maximising high through put testing, and gives the user greatly reduced working distances that allows, for the first time with this assay, single cell, high resolution imaging of actively differentiating cells.
