BACKGROUND
the atp-binding cassette  transporters form one of the largest family of membrane proteins  <cit> . with  <dig> members in total, the abc transporter family from animals was first identified in the human genome  <cit> . ranging from  <dig> to ~ <dig> members, the abc transporter family is present in all organisms  <cit> . based on sequence similarity of the atp-binding sites, the  <dig> human abc transporters can be classified into seven subfamilies . the eighth subfamily  was defined following the analysis of the genome of the fruitfly, drosophila melanogaster   <cit> . in addition to the fruitfly  <cit> , the abc transporters have been previously analyzed in another insect species, the mosquito, anopheles gambiae , at the genome-wide level  <cit> .

the abc transporters share highly conserved domains known as nucleotide binding domains . each nbd contains three characteristic motifs, including walker a box, walker b box, and abc signature c which links the two walker boxes  <cit> . nbd binds and hydrolyses atp and provides energy to transport molecules against concentration gradients. in addition to nbd, a eukaryotic abc transporter usually consists of one or two transmembrane domains . the abc transporters which have two nbds and two tmds are called full transporters, whereas those with one nbd and one tmd are called half transporters, which often constitute a functional unit by forming a homo- or heterodimer  <cit> .

according to their functions, the abc proteins can be classified as importers, exporters and non-transport proteins  <cit> . importers and exporters are responsible for transport of a wide variety of substances, whereas the third class of abc proteins are apparently not involved in molecule transport but in cellular processes such as dna repair, translation or regulation of gene expression  <cit> . in human, known functions of abc transporters include cholesterol and lipid transport, multidrug resistance, antigen presentation, mitochondrial iron homeostasis, and the atp-dependent regulation of ion channels. mutations in abc genes have been associated with a range of disorders, including cystic fibrosis, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes  <cit> . in insects, it has been shown that abc transporters have roles in uric acid metabolism, development and possibly in insecticide resistance  <cit> . due to the importance of abc transporters, several members of abc transporters have been extensively studied in several model insects, including the fruitfly and the silkworm, bombyx mori . one of the best studied insect abc transporters is white, which is a typical abcg transporter involved in pigment transport in insect eyes  <cit> .

in a microarray study published previously  <cit> , we detected multiple silkworm abc genes exhibiting possible regulation by the molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone . to this end, we decided to identify and characterize the silkworm abc transporters at the genome-wide level. very recently, three silkworm abc transporter subfamilies, including abcb, abcc and abcg, were analyzed regarding to their possible xenobiotic resistance  <cit> . in this study, we have identified  <dig> putative silkworm abc genes in total and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. moreover, we have investigated their temporal and spatial expression patterns using microarray and quantitative real-time pcr , with focus on the abcg subfamily.

RESULTS
identification of the silkworm abc transporters
the nbds of all the d. melanogaster abc transporters were used as queries for blastp search against the two silkworm genome databases, silkdb and kaikobase. each potential silkworm abc transporter was validated by searching its known orthologs from the protein database of ncbi and further searching its nbd and tmd with the pfam program. as a result, a total of  <dig> putative abc genes were identified in the silkworm genome. a previous study has identified  <dig> abc genes in d. melanogaster  <cit> . for comparative analysis, we also identified  <dig> abc genes from the flour beetle, tribolium castaneum ,  <dig> from a. gambiae , and  <dig> from the honeybee, apis mellifera  .

in silkdb,  <dig> abc genes have evidences of mrna expression with est sequences, which were collected from  <dig> cdna libraries of multiple tissues during different developmental stages. based on the est information, bmabc <dig> shows the highest transcript level with  <dig> hits. the largest abc transporter  and the smallest one  are encoded by bmabc <dig> and bmabc <dig>  respectively .

phylogenetic analysis of the silkworm abc transporters
each silkworm abc transporter possesses one or two conserved nbds . we performed a multiple sequence-alignment to construct a phylogenetic tree on the basis of ndbs of the  <dig> silkworm abc transporters. phylogenetic analysis revealed that silkworm abc transporters can be divided into  <dig> subfamilies  with high bootstrap values. the abcc subfamily can be separated into  <dig> groups, one of which shares high similarity to the abcb subfamily . among the  <dig> silkworm abc transporters, there are  <dig> full transporters and  <dig> half transporters. the abca, abcb and abcc subfamilies contain full transporters, whereas half transporters exist in  <dig> subfamilies rather than abce and abcf . the  <dig> abce and abcf proteins lack of tmds. one putative abcb transporter contains one ndb and two tmds, while one putative abcc transporter contains two ndbs and one tmd. in addition, we found that  <dig> silkworm genes encode obvious ndbs show high similarity to abc genes in the silkworm and other organisms. for convenience, we referred the  <dig> putative abc proteins as incomplete abc proteins. the incomplete sequences of those abc genes might be because the genome of silkworm is not at completion and annotation of the entire genome is not complete. for comparative analysis, we also constructed phylogenetic trees for the abc transporters from t. castaneum , a. gambiae , and a. mellifera . similarly, the abc transporters in each insect species can be divided into  <dig> subfamilies  .

genomic distribution of the silkworm abc transporters
of the  <dig> silkworm abc genes,  <dig> are dispersed on  <dig> chromosomes and  <dig> on an unmapped scaffold. gene structures of the  <dig> silkworm abc transporters show high complexity with exon numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . there are two major gene clusters located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which contain  <dig> and  <dig> abc genes, respectively. in addition, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> each contain  <dig> abc genes. gene duplication is very evident in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  also occurs in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by tandem duplication .

characterization of the silkworm abc transporter subfamilies
since the insect abc transporters can be classified into  <dig> subfamilies , we characterized each subfamily in the silkworm and four other insect species for comparison.

abca
the abca transporters in mammals perform critical functions in the control of cellular lipid-transport processes  <cit> , yet little is known about their physiological functions in insects. among the  <dig> silkworm abca genes, bmabc <dig>  bmabc <dig> and bmabc <dig> are closely located on chromosome  <dig>  the silkworm abca subfamily consists of  <dig> full transporters,  <dig> half transporter, and  <dig> incomplete abc proteins containing one single nbd in each member. this subfamily includes two of the largest abc transporters encoded by bmabc <dig>  and bmabc <dig> . in human, all abca transporters are full transporters  <cit> . in the plant, arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> are half transporters and only one is a full transporter  <cit> . no abca transporters have been identified in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . interestingly, all the  <dig> abca transporters in the mosquito, a. gambiae, are full transporters, whereas both full and half transporters exist in the abca subfamily of the four other insect species, indicating that the abca subfamily varies greatly during evolution in insects and other organisms. in addition, phylogenetic analysis reveals that  <dig> insect abca transporters, bmabc <dig>  agap <dig> and tcabca <dig>  are closely related , implying that they are orthologs .

abcb
abcb <dig> was the first human abc transporter to be cloned and characterized through its function to confer a multidrug resistance  phenotype to cancer, and later studies revealed several more mdrs in the abcb subfamily  <cit> . based on sequence similarity, the insect abcb transporters are thought to be involved in resistance to insecticides and other chemicals  <cit> . among the  <dig> silkworm abcb genes, bmabc <dig> and bmabc <dig> are closely distributed on chromosome  <dig> suggesting they were arisen by tandem duplication. the hypothesis of gene duplication is supported by phylogenetic analysis of the abcb subfamily, which indicates that the two genes are closely related in evolution . the silkworm abcb subfamily consists of  <dig> full transporters,  <dig> half transporters, and  <dig> incomplete abc protein. the same as other organisms, the abcb subfamily in all the  <dig> insect species consists of both full and half transporters. the d. melanogaster abcb gene, mdr <dig>  has multiple functions. disruption of mdr <dig> results in change of sensitivity to colchicines  <cit> . mdr <dig> is not only involved in the transport of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  <cit> , but also controls germ cell attractant  <cit> . the abcb transporter encoded by bmabc <dig> is ~49% identical to that of mdr <dig> in sequence , but whether bmabc <dig> and other silkworm abcb genes are involved in xenobiotic resistances requires further investigation  <cit> .

abcc
the mammalian abcc family members, including several multidrug resistance-associated proteins , are involved in ion transport, toxin secretion, signal transduction, and other physiological functions  <cit> . it has been suggested that the insect abcc transporters might be important for xenobiotic resistance  <cit> . with  <dig> members in total, abcc is the largest abc subfamily in the silkworm. moreover, there are  <dig> putative abcc transporters in t. castaneum. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> silkworm abcc genes are located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of the abcc subfamily within the  <dig> insect species reveals that many abcc genes belonging to the same insect species cluster together, indicating gene duplication is an active mechanism that generates high diversity in the abcc subfamily in insects . the silkworm abcc subfamily consists of  <dig> full transporters,  <dig> half transporters, and  <dig> incomplete abc proteins. all the  <dig> abcc transporters in d. melanogaster are full transporters, whereas both full and half transporters exist in the abcc subfamily of the four other insect species, supporting the evolutionary divergence of the abcc subfamily in insects. the abcc transporter encoded by cg <dig> in d. melanogaster is regulated by heavy metals via the metal-responsive transcription factor  <dig> and involved in biochemical detoxification of zinc and copper  <cit> . although several silkworm abcc transporters have sequence similarity to the protein encoded by cg <dig> in d. melanogaster , whether they might act as biochemical factors in the defense against toxins is unknown.

abcd
the abcd transporters are located to the peroxisome at the subcellular level and involved in the import of fatty acids and/or fatty acyl-coas into this organelle  <cit> . each of the  <dig> insect species consists of  <dig> half transporters in the abcd subfamily. the insect abcd transporters are separated into two distinct groups by phylogenetic analysis , indicating that they are evolutionarily conserved in insects.

abce and abcf
the abce and abcf proteins lack tmd and each member contains a pair of linked nbds  <cit> . most eukaryotes have only one abce gene that is highly conserved during evolution . different from most abc transporters, their functions in cell biological processes are not related to transport. in human, abce <dig> was identified as an inhibitor of rnase l  <cit> , whereas in yeast, abce proteins play key roles in translation initiation  <cit> . the silkworm abce gene, bmabc <dig> which shows the highest expression level based on the est information, is preferentially expressed in testis, ovary and fat body. however, rna interference -mediated knockdown of bmabc <dig> has no obvious effects on rnase l expression  <cit> .

abcf proteins function in ribosome biogenesis, translational control, and mrna export, and are not involved in molecule transport  <cit> . the best-characterized abcf protein is the yeast gcn <dig> protein, which is involved in the initiation and control of translation. in addition, mutations in gcn <dig> gene reduce eif2α phosphorylation and thus translation in the ribosome  <cit> . later studies revealed that abcf <dig> physically interacts with eif <dig> and associates with the ribosome in an atp-dependent manner  <cit> . until now, the abcf subfamily has not been studied in insects. the same as human and most of other organisms, each of the  <dig> insect species consists of  <dig> abcf proteins, which are separated into  <dig> distinct groups by phylogenetic analysis and genes in each group have high similarity . these data suggest that abce and abcf subfamilies are highly conserved during evolution in all living organisms.

abcg
the reported abcg transporters are half transporters. importantly, each abcg transporter has a tmd at the c-terminal region of nbd, showing a distinct structure  <cit> . in human, members of the abcg subfamily play key roles in lipid transport across membranes. for example, abcg <dig> is an essential mdr and its activity is associated with decreased efficacy of anticancer agents in several carcinomas. apart from its role in cancer, abcg <dig> has a broad substrate specificity and its ability to transport numerous diverse pharmaceuticals has implications for the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile of these compounds. in addition, abcg <dig> plays a role in the normal physiological transport of urate and haem  <cit> . the silkworm abcg subfamily has  <dig> members, and  <dig> of them encode half transporters. gene duplication is evident in this subfamily by the localization of gene paralogues or orthologs on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which is further supported by phylogenetic analysis . the best-studied abcg genes are those encoding eye pigment precursor transporters, white, scarlet, and brown, in d. melanogaster  <cit> . bmabc <dig>  encodes an ortholog of d. melanogaster white. polyadenylated bmwh <dig> transcript of about  <dig>  kb length is detected in eggs, malpighian tubule and pupal heads, but not in testes, posterior silk glands or fat body cells  <cit> . bmwh <dig> is responsible for the transportation of ommochrome precursors and uric acid into pigment granules and urate granules, respectively, and bmwh <dig> mutations cause white eyes, white eggs, and translucent larval skin  <cit> . bmabc <dig> encodes an ortholog of d. melanogaster scarlet. in the silkworm, scarlet forms a heterodimer with white to transport ommochrome precursors  <cit> . bmabc <dig> encodes an ortholog of d. melanogaster brown. in addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that bmabc <dig> is orthologous to d. melanogaster e <dig>  , which is a 20e primary response gene that represses 20e-mediated gene activation  <cit> . the potential physiological function of the silkworm abcg subfamily is of interest.

abch
the abch subfamily was first identified in d. melanogaster and exists solely in arthropods  <cit> . the structure organizations of the abch and abcg transporters are similar. each of the  <dig> insect genomes studied in this report has  <dig> abch genes. phylogenetic analysis suggests that the abch genes are originated from a common ancestor , yet their physiological functions remain unknown.

tissue distribution analysis reveals some tissue-specific abc genes
in order to understand the possible physiological function and hormonal regulation of the silkworm abc genes in the future, we here analyzed the expression patterns of all the silkworm abc genes by microarray data. with the exception of bmabc <dig>  all other abc genes have corresponding probes in the oligonucleotide chip  <cit> . we first investigated the spatial expression patterns of the silkworm abc genes on day  <dig> of fifth larval instar using the microarray data of tissue-specific expression  <cit> . the analysis revealed that the expression of  <dig> abc genes can be detected at least in one of the selected tissues, including testis, ovary, head, integument, malpighian tubule, fat body, haemocyte, anterior and middle silk gland, and posterior silk gland . significantly, a large number of abc genes were highly expressed in the testis compared to other tissues. it is known that more than one thousand genes are expressed specifically in the testis  <cit> . however, whether all these testis-specific abc transporters are functionally important in this male organ is questionable and worthy of further investigation.

some tissue-specific abc genes were verified by qrt-pcr in nine tissues, including fat body, midgut, testis and ovary, wing disc, trachea, brain, malpighian tubule, haemocyte, prothoracic gland, and silk gland, on day  <dig> and  <dig> of fifth larval instar and day  <dig> of prepupae. besides the testis, the malpighian tubule is the second tissue enriched with abc gene expressions. the malpighian tubule serves as the excretory and osmoregulatory organs for insects, in which the urine is produced and transported to the hindgut for the selective absorption of water and ions. thus, the malpighian tubule plays an important role in excretion and it is also involved in xenobiotic detoxification  <cit> . bmabc <dig>  an abcg gene, was exclusively and abundantly expressed in the malpighian tubule, detected by both microarray  and qrt-pcr , suggesting that bmabc <dig> might play an important role in the malpighian tubule. bmabc <dig> could serve as a malpighian tubule-specific molecule marker for future studies of gene function and regulation.

developmental expression analysis reveals several midgut-specific abcg genes
in a microarray study published previously  <cit> , we detected multiple silkworm abc genes that are highly expressed during molting and pupation, exhibiting possible regulation by 20e. we then analyzed the temporal expression patterns of the silkworm abc genes from day  <dig> of fifth instar to the adult stage using the microarray data of developmental changes of mrna  <cit> . the analysis revealed that the expression of  <dig> and  <dig> abc genes can be detected in females and males, respectively . we found that bmabc <dig>  an abcg gene, was highly expressed during pupation  and the early pupal stage , when the 20e level is high. as determined by qrt-pcr, bmabc <dig> is exclusively expressed in the midgut and highly expressed during the wandering and prepupal stages, when the 20e level is high . the microarray and qrt-pcr data suggest that the midgut-specific abcg gene, bmabc <dig>  is regulated by 20e at the transcriptional level.

we are very interested in the abcg subfamily, which is particular in both structure and function  <cit> . in an unpublished survey in d. melanogaster, we have found that several abcg transporters are exclusively expressed in two important endocrine organs, the corpus allatum which produces juvenile hormone and the prothoracic gland which produces ecdysone . to this end, we investigated the spatial expression patterns of all the  <dig> silkworm abcg genes using qrt-pcr. besides bmabc <dig>  four other genes, including bmabc <dig>  bmabc <dig>  bmabc <dig>  and bmabc <dig>  are also preferentially expressed in the midgut. moreover, we investigated their temporal expression patterns in the midgut, which revealed that the  <dig> abcg genes are highly expressed during the wandering and prepupal stages as well. the qrt-pcr data  roughly matches the microarray data , implying that they are also 20e responsive.

in addition, bmabc <dig>  and bmabc <dig> were highly expressed in brain, and the mrna level of brown peaked during the feeding stage of the fifth instar . unfortunately, we did not find any prothoracic gland-specific abcg genes in the silkworm.

the midgut-specific abcg genes were regulated by 20e via its receptor ecr-usp
the expression patterns in figure  <dig> imply that the  <dig> midgut-specific abcg genes, including bmabc <dig>  bmabc <dig>  bmabc <dig>  bmabc <dig>  and bmabc <dig>  might be up-regulated by 20e during molting and pupation. to test this hypothesis, we injected 20e into day  <dig> of fifth instar larvae and usp dsrna into larvae at the initiation of the early wandering stage, followed by measurements of their mrna levels using qrt-pcr  <cit> . as expected, the mrna level of the 20e-primary response gene e <dig> was significantly up-regulated after  <dig> hours of 20e treatment and down-regulated after  <dig> hours of usp rnai. similarly, all the  <dig> abcg genes were up-regulated by 20e treatment and down-regulated by usp rnai , demonstrating that the  <dig> midgut-specific abcg genes are up-regulated by 20e during molting and pupation.

it has been reported that the tmd of abcg <dig> binds steroids and the binding mediates modulation of abcg <dig> activity  <cit> . however, little is known about whether and how abcg genes are transcriptionally regulated by steroid hormones in mammals. since gene duplication is very evident in the abcg subfamily in insects but not in human, the similarity of abcg transporters in both physiological function and hormonal regulation is of great interest. we suppose that transcriptional regulation of abcg genes by the steroid hormone 20e in the silkworm holds promising values for further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a genome-wide analysis of the abc transporters from the silkworm and a comparative analysis of the abc family from  <dig> insect species. a large number of silkworm abc genes are highly expressed in the testis and the malpighian tubule. two abcg genes, bmabc <dig> and bmabc <dig>  are exclusively expressed in the malpighian tubule and the midgut, respectively. moreover,  <dig> abcg genes are preferentially expressed in the midgut and their transcriptional levels are up-regulated by 20e during molting and pupation. the descriptive study of silkworm abcg genes lays a foundation for future analysis of their physiological function and hormonal regulation, using both the rnai approach  <cit>  and the binary gal4/uas transgenic system  <cit> .
