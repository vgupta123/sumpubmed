BACKGROUND
in rodents, about two thirds of excitatory, pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex are generated from progenitor cells that divide beneath the apical surface of the embryonic cortical neuroepithelium in a region called the subventricular zone . these cells, known as intermediate progenitor cells, are marked by their expression of the transcription factor tbr <dig>  <cit> . most of them divide just once to generate two postmitotic neurons that migrate into the developing cortical plate   <cit> . during this process, these differentiating cells activate expression of the transcription factor tbr <dig>  <cit> . intermediate progenitors are themselves generated by the division of radial glial cells at the apical  surface of the neuroepithelium, in the ventricular zone . radial glial cells express the transcription factor pax <dig>  intermediate progenitors and postmitotic neurons do not  <cit> .

early in corticogenesis, pax <dig> expression levels are graded across the ventricular zone of the developing cortical neuroepithelium. levels increase with proximity to the boundary between the lateral cortex and the subpallium. pax <dig> exerts regional control of cell proliferation, with its greatest effects in anterior and lateral regions where its levels are highest  <cit> . it is required for the development of a normal complement of tbr2-expressing intermediate progenitors  <cit> . the mechanisms by which it regulates these processes are poorly understood.

previous work screening for transcriptional changes in the cortex of mice with a null-mutation of pax <dig> identified cdca <dig>  as a gene whose expression is increased by loss of pax <dig> function  <cit> . it is a nuclear protein containing a zinc finger dna-binding domain in both human and mouse  <cit> . most of what we know about the functions of cdca <dig> comes from studies in non-cortical systems. in the haematopoietic system there is evidence that it affects cell specification and differentiation rather than proliferation  <cit> . elsewhere, it has been associated with neoplastic transformation  <cit> , but its mechanisms of action are unclear. it is a target of the e2f family of transcription factors, which are involved in cell proliferation and whose activity is regulated by pax <dig> in the developing cortex  <cit> .

in the current work, we first analysed the relationship between the normal expression patterns of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> and the effects of pax <dig> loss on cdca <dig> expression. we found evidence that pax <dig> represses cdca <dig> expression in the lateral cortex, where pax <dig> levels are normally highest, with loss of pax <dig> increasing lateral cortical expression of cdca <dig>  we then studied the effects of increasing cdca <dig> expression in the lateral cortex by electroporating a cdca <dig> expression vector into this region. we found that elevated cdca <dig> levels reduce the production of tbr2+ and tbr1+ cells early in lateral cortical formation, suggesting that repression of cdca <dig> by pax <dig> is required for the normal production of intermediate progenitors in this region.

in situ hybridisation
embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose and sectioned at 10 μm. in situ hybridization followed a standard protocol  <cit> . antisense rna probes were labelled with digoxigenin . to make plasmids for cdca <dig> probe generation, the following primers were used: cdca <dig> forward, tctgagagctctgcaaacga; cdca <dig> reverse, agctgcagttgcaaattcct. a 745 bp cdca <dig> fragment was cloned into pgem-t easy vector . this was linearized with sacii and the probe was generated using sp <dig> rna polymerase. the generation of probe for pax <dig> was described previously  <cit> .

immunohistochemistry
cryosections  were subject to antigen retrieval by microwaving for 20 min in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer. after blocking with 20% donkey serum, sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °c. the primary antibodies used were mouse anti-pax <dig> , rabbit anti-cdca <dig> , goat anti-gfp and rat anti-brdu , rabbit anti-tbr <dig> and rabbit anti-tbr <dig> , 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole . secondary antibodies were conjugated with alexa fluor  <dig> or  <dig> . fluorescent and confocal images were acquired with a leica dm5500b microscope and a nikon a1r confocal microscope, respectively.

generation of cdca7-expression vector

cdca <dig> cdna open reading frame  obtained from origene technologies  was combined with sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin  epitope at its 3′ end to generate a ha-tagged cdca <dig> orf . nhei restriction sites at both 3′ and 5′ ends were used to clone the tagged cdca <dig> cdna into the expression plasmid pcaggs_ires-nls-gfp   <cit> . the cdca <dig> expression vector is called pcaggs_cdca <dig> 

cell culture, transfection and western blotting
human embryonic kidney   <dig> cells were maintained in dmem medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum. cells were incubated at 37 °c with 5% co <dig> and transfected using lipofectamine  <dig> . cell lysates were collected with passive lysis buffer  48 h post transfection. for western blotting, the primary antibodies were rabbit anti-ha  and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase .

in utero electroporation
wild-type cd <dig> females were used for in utero electroporation. purified plasmid dna  was adjusted to 2 μg/μl. in the afternoon of the electroporation day, animals were given one dose of analgesia  and received isoflurane throughout the operation. plasmids  were injected into the lateral ventricle of embryos aged e <dig>  or e <dig> . electroporation was achieved using cuy <dig> ,  <dig> volts for e <dig>  and  <dig> volts for e <dig>  embryos in 50 ms pulses with 950 ms intervals. all procedures were covered by home office project licence 60/ <dig> and personal licence 60/ <dig>  following the on-site regulations and were approved by the edinburgh university veterinary physicians. a single dose of bromodeoxyuridine  in  <dig> % nacl was administrated intraperitoneally to the pregnant females   <dig>  h post-electroporation. pregnant females were sacrificed 30 min after brdu injection and embryos were used in histological procedures described above.

quantifications
to estimate gradients of expression, average values  for slopes of intensity plots were calculated from  <dig> wild-type and  <dig> pax6
−/− embryos at e <dig>  and at e <dig>  and  <dig> embryos of each genotype at e <dig>  . to estimate frequencies of tbr2+ and tbr1+ and brdu+ cells in the population of gfp+ cells after e <dig>  electroporation we used  <dig> control and  <dig> experimental embryos, and after e <dig>  electroporation we used  <dig> control and  <dig> experimental embryos. each embryo was from a different litter. images were acquired using a nikon a1r confocal microscope. proportions of gfp+ cells that were either tbr2+, tbr1+ or brdu+ were counted in sampling regions up to 200 µm wide in  <dig> sections through the core of the electroporated region in each embryo. to estimate relative levels of endogenously and exogenously driven cdca <dig> protein expression, fluorescence intensity values were obtained by outlining cells of interested and measuring each one’s total grey intensity using fiji software. average values under different conditions were obtained from multiple cells. all comparisons were done within the same images to avoid effects of batch and differential exposure.

RESULTS
comparison of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> expression patterns in wild-type and pax6−/− embryos
pax <dig> is expressed at high levels in the ventricular zone of the developing cerebral cortex and at lower levels in the ventricular zone of the lateral ganglionic eminence . at the earliest stages of murine cortical neurogenesis, around embryonic days 12– <dig> , pax <dig> expression levels are graded from rostro-lateral  to caudo-medial . as corticogenesis continues, this gradient of pax <dig> expression becomes progressively less steep  <cit> . at all embryonic ages, pax <dig> expression levels drop sharply at the boundary between pallium and subpallium. we tested whether the expression pattern of cdca <dig> normally correlates with that of pax <dig> and whether the expression of cdca <dig> is affected in mutants that are null for pax <dig> 

in situ hybridization was used to reveal the expression patterns of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> in adjacent sections from wild-type  and pax6
−/−  embryos at e <dig>  . note that while the pax <dig> null mutants used here do not produce functional pax <dig> protein , they do still express mutant pax <dig> mrna  <cit> . the expression pattern of pax <dig> described above can be seen in fig. 1a, a′, b, b′. there were much higher levels of pax <dig> in lateral cortex than in lge, with a sharp transition at the pallial-subpallial boundary . in contrast, cdca <dig> expression levels were lower in the lateral cortex than in the lge . in e <dig>  pax6
−/− embryos, the decline in pax <dig> expression across the pspb was more gradual than normal  and the dip in cdca <dig> expression levels in the region of high pax <dig> expression in the lateral cortex was no longer obvious . by e <dig> , wild-type pax <dig> expression levels were consistently high across the pallium and, as at e <dig> , they showed a sharp decline at the pspb . wild-type cdca <dig> expression levels again showed an opposing pattern, being lower in the lateral cortex than in the lge with a sharp change in levels at the pspb . in e <dig>  pax6
−/− embryos , pax <dig> expression declined more gradually than normal across the pspb, as at e <dig>  , but the high levels of cdca <dig> expression observed in subpallium continued across the pspb deep into the lateral cortex where they now overlapped high pax <dig> expression . these findings suggest that pax <dig> is a negative regulator of cdca <dig> in the lateral cortex.fig.  <dig> expression of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> at e <dig>  in wild-type and pax6

we used a quantitative approach to confirm the breakdown in the normal expression of cdca <dig> when pax <dig> is mutated. in situ hybridizations for pax <dig> and cdca <dig> were carried out on comparable sections from wild-type and pax6
−/− littermate embryos aged e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig> , mounted and processed together on the same slide to minimise batch effects. images were analysed with fiji software. each image was converted to 8-bit  and a ribbon whose width corresponded to that of the gene expression domains was drawn through the telencephalon from dorsal to ventral as shown in fig. 3a, b. average pixel intensities were calculated in 10 µm bins along the ribbon. background staining was measured in areas expressing neither gene and average pixel intensities were corrected by subtracting bg values to obtain intensity profiles such as those shown in fig. 3c, d. the profiles were divided into a pallial and a subpallial part based on the expression pattern of the pax <dig> gene. regression analysis gave values for the slopes on the two sides . average slopes from several animals were combined to give the graphs in fig. 3e, f .fig.  <dig> quantitative analysis of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> expression. a, b representative images showing the mrna expression of  pax <dig> and  cdca <dig>  sampling ribbons were drawn from medial cortex across the pspb  to ventral telencephalon and pixel intensities measured in the direction of the blue arrows. background  staining was measured in areas expressing neither gene. scale bar 100 µm. c, d average pixel intensity values along the ribbons in a and b, calculated by fiji: the slopes of the regression lines dorsal and ventral to the pspb were calculated. e, f average values  for slopes calculated as in c, d from multiple individuals 




in the pallium , two way anova showed significant effects of both genotype and age on the gradients of pax <dig> and cdca <dig>  with significant interaction effects for both genes . in wild-types, the gradients of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> expression were opposite at e <dig>  . their magnitudes declined significantly over the following days, approaching  or reaching  zero by e <dig>   . in pax6
−/− pallium, the gradient of pax <dig> expression was much smaller than normal at e <dig>   and then reversed . there was no gradient of cdca <dig> expression at e <dig>   but one appeared, with a slope opposite to normal, over the subsequent 2 days  .

on the ventral side of the pspb , two way anova showed a significant effect of genotype but not age on the gradients of pax <dig> and cdca <dig>  with no significant interaction effect for either gene . pax <dig> and cdca <dig> were expressed in opposing gradients from e <dig> - <dig>  , while in pax6
−/− embryos the gradients of pax <dig> were less steep than normal  and the gradients of cdca <dig> were abolished . these quantifications support our conclusion that the cdca <dig> expression gradient is disrupted by mutation of pax <dig> 

double-immunohistochemistry for pax <dig> and cdca <dig> in wild-type e <dig>  embryos was used to test pax <dig> and cdca <dig> co-expression by cells in the ventricular zone. this confirmed the complementarity of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> expression patterns around the pspb . cells on the subpallial side of the pspb showed low pax <dig> levels and high cdca <dig> levels . interestingly, cdca <dig> levels in the subpallium were particularly high in the subventricular zone , in line with the relatively strong staining for cdca <dig> mrna in this layer . this strong subventricular zone staining came to an abrupt end at the pspb . on the pallial side of the pspb, cells with higher levels of pax <dig> staining showed lower levels of cdca <dig> . in the region further away from the pspb, cells with higher levels of cdca <dig> showed lower pax <dig> staining . immunohistochemistry on pax6
−/− embryos showed the elevation of cdca <dig> protein levels in lateral cortex and the loss of the medial to lateral gradient in its expression .fig.  <dig> expression of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> protein at e <dig> . a–c images of staining for pax <dig>  cdca <dig> and both in the telencephalon; lateral ganglionic eminence , medial ganglionic eminence . a′–c′ higher magnification of the regions around the pspb in a–c. i–iii images show the inverse relationship between the expression levels of the two proteins in individual cells. d, d′ staining for cdca <dig> in e <dig>  pax6

our new findings, together with previous microarray and quantitative pcr data showing that levels of cdca <dig> increase in the pallium of pax6
−/− mutant embryos  <cit> , indicate that high levels of pax <dig> normally present in the lateral cortex repress cdca <dig> expression in this region. we next assessed the functional importance of this repression by asking what would happen if cdca <dig> levels were to increase in the lateral cortex of normal embryos.

the consequences of elevating cdca <dig> expression in lateral cortex
as cells exit the e <dig>  pax6+ cortical ventricular zone, many of them upregulate tbr <dig> and become intermediate progenitors in the subventricular zone before dividing again to generate tbr1+ neurons that enter the cortical plate   <cit> . interestingly, this process is most advanced in the lateral cortex, where cdca <dig> levels are most strongly suppressed by pax <dig>  to test whether low levels of cdca <dig> in the lateral cortex are important for cortical development to proceed normally in this region, we elevated cdca <dig> levels in progenitors in the lateral cortex of normal embryos and examined the effects on cell proliferation and differentiation into tbr2+ and tbr1+ cells.fig.  <dig> effects of forced expression of cdca <dig> in vivo. a schematic showing the expression patterns of pax <dig> , tbr <dig>  and tbr <dig> . area in box is shown in e–g. b cdca <dig> expression vector pcaggs_cdca <dig> containing cdca <dig> open reading frame. c cdca <dig> expression plasmid was transiently transfected into hek <dig> cells. cell lysates were collected 48 h post transfection and cdca <dig> expression was verified using an antibody against the ha epitope. the molecular weight of cdca <dig> was approximately 43 kda. gapdh was used as a loading control. d control  or cdca <dig> expression vector was used for in utero electroporation at e <dig>  or e <dig> . brdu was injected 30 min before termination. e–j immunofluorescence images show the expression of gfp and cdca <dig> in the electroporated lateral cortex. h–j almost all gfp+ cells co-express cdca <dig> at levels obviously higher than endogenous. outlines of gfp+ cells are overlaid on cdca <dig> cells in j. white arrows indicate a cell with strong gfp but cdca <dig> levels that are not obviously raised above endogenous. red arrows indicate a cell with a low gfp level but a high cdca <dig> level. scale bars

the open reading frame of a full length cdca <dig> cdna was tagged with influenza hemagglutinin  sequence to generate an ha epitope-tagged version of cdca <dig>  this was cloned into the expression vector pcaggs_gfp, which expresses green fluorescent protein  tagged with a nuclear localization signal  . the cdca <dig> expression plasmid was validated by transient transfection of hek <dig> cells. at 48 h post transfection, cell lysates were analysed by western blot with an antibody against the ha epitope . the level of expression of cdca <dig> correlated with the concentration of vector used in the transfection. the lateral cortex of wild-type e <dig>  or e <dig>  embryos was electroporated in utero with either the cdca <dig> expression plasmid pcaggs_cdca <dig> or empty vector  as a control. embryos were injected with bromodeoxyuridine   <dig>  h later and culled after a further  <dig>  h . gfp+ cells were detected through the depth of the lateral cortex 16 h post-electroporation . immunohistochemistry for cdca <dig> showed that they expressed higher levels of cdca <dig> than their neighbours . since the cdca <dig> antibody gave clear evidence of increased expression, confirmation using the ha tag in vivo was not considered necessary. we examined  <dig> gfp+ cells randomly selected from six different sections through the electroporated areas of these embryos and found that  <dig> % of them showed cdca <dig> expression increased above endogenous levels . in general, staining for cdca <dig> was stronger in cells with stronger gfp signals, but there were frequent exceptions . most likely this was due to the use of an internal ribosomal entry site  in the construct. it is known that ires activities can vary greatly between cells due to intercellular variation in the levels of positive or negative regulatory ires trans-acting factors that influence ires function but not cap-mediated initiation  <cit> .

we estimated the level of cdca <dig> expression from the electroporated cells relative to surrounding non-electroporated cells by randomly selecting  <dig> gfp-expressing cells and  <dig> intermingled gfp-non-expressing cells within the lateral cortex, outlining each cell and measuring the intensity of the cdca <dig> signal from each using fiji software. we found that the average intensity of the cdca <dig> signal was  <dig> -fold higher in the gfp+ than in the gfp− cells. to put this difference into context, we then carried out the same analysis with  <dig> gfp-non-expressing cells from the ventral telencephalon, where cdca <dig> is highly expressed by some cells; in this case we selected cells with high levels of expression, located in the ventral telencephalic subventricular zone . we found that the average intensity of the cdca <dig> signal from these high-expressing ventral cells was  <dig> -fold higher than that from the non-electroporated lateral cortical cells. these values suggest that the electroporated cells in the lateral cortex achieved levels of cdca <dig> that were similar to the endogenous levels present in the most highly expressing cells in the ventral telencephalon. this approximates to the situation in pax6
−/− mutants , where the intensity of cdca <dig> signals from lateral telencephalic cells becomes closer to that from ventral telencephalic cells .

we examined all gfp+ electroporated cells 16 h after electroporation at either e <dig>  or e <dig>  in a series of sections stained for: gfp and tbr2; gfp and tbr1; gfp and brdu. we found no evidence that the elevation of cdca <dig> levels altered the distribution of affected cells through the cortical depth 16 h after electroporation . average proportions of gfp+ cells that were double-labelled for tbr <dig>  tbr <dig> or brdu were obtained from an analysis of multiple electroporated embryos .fig.  <dig> the distribution of electroporated cells with raised cdca <dig> levels in lateral cortex is not different from control. a gfp+  and tbr2+  cells were counted in ten 250 µm-wide bins of equal depth from ventricular zone to pia . b, c average proportions of gfp+ and tbr2+ cells in each bin are plotted. the average depth of gfp+ cells on the scale of 1– <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in control and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in experimental animals . the average depth of tbr2+ cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in experimental animals

there was a significant reduction by ~20–25% in the proportion of gfp+ cells that were tbr2+ in embryos electroporated with cdca <dig> at e <dig>  , although not in those electroporated at e <dig>  . in both cases, the gfp+ tbr2+ cells were in the same layer as the non-electroporated  tbr2+ cells. these data suggest that raised levels of cdca <dig> reduce the generation of tbr2+ intermediate progenitors in the early stages of corticogenesis. early-generated tbr2+ progenitors are known to produce tbr1+ neurons  <cit>  and, 16 h after electroporation on e <dig> , small numbers of gfp+ tbr1+ cells had reached the deep edge of the cortical plate. the proportions of gfp+ cells that were tbr1+ were significantly lower in cells overexpressing cdca <dig> than in control cells fig. 7k–o, which is likely to be a consequence of the underproduction of tbr2+ intermediate progenitors.

analysis of the proportion of cells labelled by brdu shortly before animals were sacrificed allowed us to assess whether elevated cdca <dig> levels in the lateral cortex had a drastic effect on proliferation, for example bringing effected cells out of the cell cycle. we found that 20–30% of gfp+ cells took up brdu in both control and experimental groups following electroporation at e <dig>  or e <dig>  . at neither age did electroporation with the cdca7-expressing plasmid have a significant effect on the proportions of gfp+ cells that were in s-phase in the lateral cortex 16 h later .

our findings indicate that the main effect of elevated cdca <dig> expression in early embryonic lateral cortical progenitors is to reduce the production of cells expressing tbr <dig>  which is the hallmark of intermediate progenitors.

discussion
based on new findings reported here, we suggest that one of the actions of pax <dig> in the embryonic cerebral cortex is to suppress cdca <dig> expression and thereby enhance the production of tbr2+ intermediate progenitors. interestingly, our experiments suggested that this suppressive effect is most prominent in the lateral cortex early in corticogenesis, where cortical levels of pax <dig> expression are highest  <cit> . since tbr2+ intermediate progenitors are transit amplifying cells, an increase in their numbers will increase neuronal output . it is well known that lateral cortex develops ahead of other cortical regions: for example, at early stages lateral cortex is thicker, has many more tbr2+ intermediate progenitors and more neurons in its cortical plate than medial regions. previous studies have shown that one of the striking anatomical abnormalities of the pax6
−/− forebrain is a failure of the lateral cortex to expand ahead of more medial regions. this regional defect has been linked to a disproportionate underproduction of tbr2+ cells in the lateral cortex of pax6
−/− embryos, a loss which equilibrates the numbers of tbr2+ cells across all cortical regions  <cit> . it is possible that, in normal development, suppression of cdca <dig> by high levels of pax <dig> is an important factor allowing lateral cortex to develop ahead of other cortical regions.

on the ventral side of the pspb in wild-type embryos, pax <dig> levels are lower and cdca <dig> levels are higher, particularly in the subventricular zone of the subpallium. as an extension of the present study, it would be interesting to test with gene knock-out or knock-down experiments whether the particularly high levels of cdca <dig> that we observed in the subpallial subventricular zone contribute to the lack of tbr <dig> expression in the cells of this region.

relatively little is known about the mechanisms of action of cdca <dig>  human and mouse cdca7/cdca <dig> are nuclear proteins which contain a zinc finger domain in the c-terminus  <cit> . in humans, cdca <dig> was first identified as a myc direct target and cdca <dig> protein is often found to be overexpressed in human solid tumours . previous research has indicated an interaction of cdca <dig> with notch, a molecule with actions in cell fate determination that is expressed in many tissues including the cortex  <cit> . the evidence for this interaction comes from studies on a completely different cell type, namely e <dig>  aorta-gonad-mesonephros tissue. these studies suggest that cdca <dig> is a direct, positively regulated target of notch signalling  <cit> . in the developing cortex, cells that receive notch signalling preserve their radial glial identity  <cit> . it is possible, therefore, that cdca <dig> acts downstream of notch activation to enhance the production of cells with radial glial identity, which might explain why cdca <dig> overexpression reduced the proportions of cells acquiring the tbr2+ intermediate progenitor cell fate in our experiments. further experiments might address whether, in lateral cortex, notch activation affects cdca <dig> expression and whether the repressive effects of pax <dig> on cdca <dig> expression are direct, or an indirect consequence of effects on notch signalling, or both.

cdca <dig> overexpression early in corticogenesis reduced not only the production of tbr2+ intermediate progenitors but also the production of tbr1+ cells. the divisions of tbr2+ cells generate tbr1+ neuronal precursors early in corticogenesis. the length of cell cycles in the cerebral cortex is around 10 h at e <dig> , which is a few hours shorter than the 16 h between electroporation and sacrifice in our experiments  <cit> . it seems likely, therefore, that the expression plasmid entered some cells that had already started to move to the subventricular zone, where they underwent a further division to produce tbr1+ neuronal precursors. in the subventricular zone, approximate 25% of tbr2+ cell co-express tbr <dig>  <cit> , presumably as they transform from their progenitor to their neuronal precursor state during or following division. it is plausible, therefore, that the reduction of tbr1+ cells following cdca <dig> overexpression is a consequence of the reduction of tbr2+ intermediate progenitors. further work is required to test this possibility, as well the additional hypothesis that some of the reduction of tbr1+ cells results from reduced direct neurogenesis from radial glial cells.

finally, our quantitative analysis of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> mrna cortical expression gradients following mutation of the pax <dig> gene indicated that both become highly abnormal from e <dig>  to e <dig> . by e <dig> , the slopes of both gradients had reversed from normal. this result highlights the complexity of the molecular interactions that establish graded expression patterns. it indicates that pax <dig> is not the only factor that can affect differential cdca <dig> expression levels across the developing cortex. changes in the expression of pax <dig> mrna in pax6
−/− mice are likely to result from a loss of direct or indirect autoregulation of the pax <dig> locus, which is known to be a prominent element in the control of expression of the pax <dig> gene  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provides evidence of counter-gradients of pax <dig> and cdca <dig> during embryonic ages e <dig>  to e <dig>  in mice and this relationship is disrupted when pax <dig> is absent. in addition, elevated cdca <dig> in the lateral cortex reduces the production of intermediate progenitors and postmitotic neurons, suggesting that repression of cdca <dig> by pax <dig> is required for the normal production of intermediate progenitors in this region.
