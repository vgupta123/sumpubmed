BACKGROUND
the simple and often used biological model to unravel transcriptional regulation ascribes the change in gene expression levels, as observed between different cellular conditions, to changes in the activity of transcription factors . change of the transcriptional activity of a tf is one of the means by which an organism adapts to changes in the extracellular environment. a substantial amount of research has employed this model to infer regulatory networks by integrating gene expression data, sequence data , e.g.  <cit> , and/or tf binding data, e.g.  <cit> . for an overview see  <cit> . in most cases, the generated regulatory networks are derived from large microarray compendia. notwithstanding the many advantages of such approaches, two main drawbacks can be identified. firstly, these compendia gather very heterogeneous gene expression data derived from various culture conditions  that, in a large majority of the cases, solely compare the culture conditions to their direct condition-specific references. different cultivation conditions within the compendium can, therefore, hardly be compared. secondly, the interpretation of transcriptome data obtained from the generally employed shake-flask cultivations is likely to be complicated by differences in specific growth rate, carbon catabolite repression, nitrogen catabolite repression, and more generally continuous changes in environmental conditions. this prevents the establishment of a direct link between the activity of tfs and specific growth conditions.

a frequently employed approach links a tf to a module, i.e. a set of co-expressed genes, based on tf binding data or promoter analysis. enrichment of functional categories  within the module provides clues about the function of the tfs associated with the module. although this can provide a global view of the transcriptional role of a tf, we are convinced that the precise conditions or perturbations that trigger a change in the activity of tfs should be an integral part of the generated regulatory network.

to this end, we designed an experimental setup that allowed us to explicitly model the cultivation conditions and use these to infer the activity of tfs. to achieve this, we employed chemostat cultures that enable the cultivation of micro-organisms under tightly defined environmental conditions. chemostat cultures are superior to the shake-flask cultures in both accuracy and reproducibility  <cit> . in a chemostat, culture broth  is continuously replaced by fresh medium at a fixed and accurately determined dilution rate. when the dilution rate is lower than μmax, the maximal specific growth rate of the micro-organism, a steady-state situation will be established in which the specific growth rate equals the dilution rate. in such a steady-state chemostat culture, μ, is controlled by the  residual concentration of a single growth-limiting nutrient. in this research, microarrays were employed to measure the genome-wide transcriptional response of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to growth limitation by four different macronutrients  in both aerobic and anaerobic chemostat cultures   <cit> . except for the different nutrient limitations and oxygen availability, all other culture parameters  were kept constant throughout the different experiments. thus, changes in gene expression levels can solely be attributed to the different nutrient limitations and the oxygen regime. we devised a computational approach that exploits the interrelatedness between the conditions in order to identify the individual and combined effects of nutrient limitations and oxygen availability on expression behavior and tf activity. the inclusion of the growth conditions in the analysis allows for the identification of direct links between the cultivation conditions, tfs triggered by specific cultivation conditions and the targets of these tfs.

RESULTS
overview of the computation approach
from the continuous expression levels measured across the cultivation conditions we derive a discretized representation of the expression behavior for each gene. this representation indicates up- or downregulation as a consequence of the individual or combined effects of the nutrient limitations and oxygen availability. here, we exploit the combinatorial setup of the cultivation conditions to recognize and dissect the effect of the presence of oxygen on the expression levels of a gene. more specifically, we employ a regression strategy to detect, model and correct for the effect of oxygen presence. this procedure is outlined in figure  <dig> and explained in detail in the methods section. modules are generated by clustering genes with identical expression representations . next, we integrate tf binding data  <cit>  to assess whether a tf or a pair of tfs binds the promoter regions of a module much more frequently than would be expected by chance. a significant relationship between a module and a tf suggests that the tf is  responsible for the expression behavior of that particular module. since the expression behavior of a module reveals under which combination of cultivation conditions the genes are up- or downregulated, we are not only able to relate tfs to the groups of genes that they presumably regulate, but also to the precise environmental conditions that trigger their activity to perform their regulatory role.

overview of the uncovered regulatory relationships
the tf circle  depicts an overview of all the tfs, which are significantly related to one or more modules. in addition, pairs of tfs that can bind the promoter region of the genes in a module significantly often, are connected by a solid line. in the tf circle, the modules and their associated tfs are categorized according to the cultivation parameters under which the genes in the module are differentially regulated, i.e. where the discretized representation differs from zero. this arrangement is given by the color coding of the segments in the circle. from this it is clear which cultivation parameters affect the activity of a tf. additional information concerning enrichment of gene annotation categories and results of motif discovery in promoter regions of the genes within the modules can be found in table  <dig> and more comprehensively in additional file  <dig> 

in the remainder of this section, modules connected to anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and sulfur metabolism, are discussed in more detail. however, first we consider module  <dig>  that contains all genes that do not exhibit differential expression between the eight experimental conditions.  three regulators have been assigned to this module, fhl <dig>  sfp <dig> and rap <dig>  all three tfs are known to play an essential role in the regulation of ribosomal protein genes  <cit> . although the strains were grown under different nutrient limitations and oxygen regime, the dilution rate  of saccharomyces cerevisiae was kept equal  during the chemostat steady state in all the fermentation conditions tested  <cit> ). given that expression regulation of ribosomal protein genes is one of the end targets of the tor  signaling pathway, our results suggest that the regulation through the tor signalling cascade is independent of the applied nutrient limitation and oxygen availability, but would rather reflect how the cell senses the limiting nutrient to maintain a determined growth rate.

controlling anaerobiosis
module  <dig>  comprises all  genes that show consistent upregulation under anaerobic conditions, irrespective of any nutrient condition. note that our strategy enables us to isolate the effect that the presence of oxygen has on the expression level of a gene. this offers the obvious advantage to independently analyze this effect. the irrelevance of the nutrient limitations is indicated by 'x's in the discretized representation of module  <dig> in figure  <dig>  several tfs and tf pairs were found to be able to bind the genes of this anaerobiosis module significantly often. current knowledge on gene expression regulation under anaerobic conditions cannot explain all the regulatory relationships and related tfs. the anaerobic growth conditions within our systematic experiments can therefore contribute to elucidate the role of several regulators in the absence of oxygen.

the identification of rox <dig>  already known to play a role in low oxygen processes, objectively validates the truthfulness of this analysis. according to  <cit> , this heme-dependent transcriptional repressor of hypoxic genes  <cit>  constitutes a multi-component transcription factor loop together with yap <dig> and cin <dig>  i.e. these three tfs form a regulatory circuit in which they regulate each other. although our algorithm does not explore these kind of network structures, we identify the concerted regulation amongst these three tfs and based on our results can hypothesize that this loop is active under anaerobic conditions. additionally, we find the pair ste <dig> and tec <dig> which is known to activate genes associated with pseudohyphal growth, as well as dig <dig>  which conversely is involved in the negative regulation of genes involved in pseudohyphal growth  <cit> . ). finally, the tf pair mcm <dig> and swi <dig> is connected to anaerobiosis, although both are known to be involved in controlling cell cycle  <cit> . moreover, mcm <dig>  is also involved in mating and response to pheromone, relating it to the cluster of ste <dig>  tec <dig> and dig <dig>  these results correlate with the observation that saccharomyces cerevisiae grown under anaerobic conditions exhibits elongated cell-shape irrespective of the applied nutrient limitation . further investigation is needed to gain more insight into the role of these regulators in control of anaerobiosis.

missing from the tfs significantly related to the anaerobiosis module is upc <dig>  which together with rox <dig> is involved in regulating the expression of many genes induced under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . the reason for not retrieving upc <dig> is simply the absence of this tf in the genome-wide location analysis employed to build the tf database. employing motif discovery, however, the aerobic regulator  <dig>  binding motif of upc <dig>  was found  <dig> times in the upstream regions of the  <dig> genes  .

controlling aerobiosis
the tfs hap <dig> and hap <dig> are associated with the regulation of aerobiosis . hap <dig> is solely connected to the presence of oxygen , while hap <dig> is also connected to carbon-limitation . this is in agreement with a role for hap <dig> in both aerobic regulation and glucose derepression  <cit> . amongst the targets of hap <dig>  which are overrepresented in modules  <dig> and  <dig>  we find well-known oxygen specific hap <dig> regulated genes such as ctt <dig>  cyb <dig> and cyc <dig>  confirming that its regulatory role is linked to the presence of oxygen irrespective of limited or high glucose availability. the presence of hap <dig> as part of the hap2/hap3/hap4/hap <dig> complex fits with the enrichment in energy categories in the aerobic genes . this is in line with the involvement of the hap complex in the regulation of mitochondrial functions such as tca cycle, electron transport chain and respiration. however, overrepresentation of only hap <dig> targets from the location analysis dataset may appear as a surprise. overrepresentation of hap <dig> or hap <dig> may be expected, because these two subunits of hap2/hap3/hap4/hap <dig> actually bind the dna, while hap <dig>  as a regulatory subunit, does not.

furthermore, a clear-cut discrepancy exists between the location analysis data of the separate members of the hap complex. the results of this study imply that the tf binding data of hap <dig> is the more relevant one. this would then suggest that in order to monitor the dna binding of a transcriptional complex, e.g. hap2/hap3/hap4/hap <dig>  it would be more suitable to tag the subunits that do not bind the dna template, speculating that tagging dna binding subunits may alter the structure of the complex and, consequently, the affinity and the specificity of the interaction with the dna.

sulfur metabolism
the systematic combinatorial setup of cultivation conditions used to generate the transcript data allows us to extract specific information on genes regulated in response to a certain nutrient limitation. modules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> form prime examples. module  <dig>  contains all  sulfur-limitation-upregulated genes, regardless of the effect that the presence of oxygen might have on the expression of the genes. modules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> consist of the sulfur-limitation-upregulated genes for which oxygen presence leads to higher expression , lower expression  and no significant change in expression . thus, module  <dig> is the union of modules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  figure  <dig> displays genes from module  <dig> that are bound by the tfs, which are significantly related to the set of sulfur regulated genes. in this map, genes are subdivided into groups based on their response to oxygen presence. several genes that show either a higher or lower expression level depending on oxygen presence, i.e. genes from module  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, also have a binding site for the significant tfs. for example, met <dig>  involved in methionine biosynthesis, exhibits higher expression when grown anaerobically. this can be related to the fact that the promoter sequence of met <dig> contains a lore  motif  <cit> , which provides clues for future research to elucidate the functionality of this gene. amongst the genes that have a higher expression when grown aerobically and that are bound by significant tfs, is str <dig>  involved in homocysteine and cysteine interconversion that is part of the sulfur amino acid biosynthesis and sulfur degradation pathway. currently no relationship is known between sulfur- and oxygen-dependent regulation of this gene.

the regulatory network constructed from our analysis reveals a complex interplay between six individual transcription factors  and four pairs of regulators  connected to sulfur metabolism. met <dig>  met <dig>  met <dig> and cbf <dig> constitute an internal validation of the analysis, since these four factors are indeed known as members of the met regulatory complex  <cit>  that also includes the regulatory subunit met <dig>  more interestingly, our data provide new insight into sulfur metabolism regulation by implicating new regulators as tye <dig> and the members of the fungal-specific family of basic leucine zipper  proteins yap <dig>  cad <dig>  and yap <dig>  literature reports available so far concerning tye <dig> limit its role to cell cycle  <cit> . our results, however, would implicate that tye <dig> in combination with cbf <dig> would participate in the regulation of the genes encoding the upper part of the sulfur assimilation pathway including met <dig>  met <dig>  ecm <dig>  met <dig> and atm <dig>  who's gene products are involved in maturation of cytosolic fe/s  proteins  <cit> . even more interesting is the possible cross-coupling with phosphate metabolism. as indicated in figure  <dig>  cbf <dig> was also found to bind the upstream regions of phosphorus regulated genes significantly often. given that cbf <dig>  pho <dig> and tye <dig> recognize similar binding sites, our results could shed new light on the possible cross-regulation of phosphate and sulfate metabolism that centers around pho <dig> and cbf <dig>  <cit> .

in the case of cad <dig> and yap <dig> the link to sulfur metabolism may correlate to their reported role in mediating resistance to cadmium , which leads to changes in the sulfate assimilation pathway and to sulfur sparing  <cit> . when saccharomyces cerevisiae is exposed to cd2+ most of the sulfur assimilated by the cells is converted into glutathione, a thiol-metabolite essential for detoxification. yeast adapts to this vital metabolite requirement by globally modifying its proteome to reduce the production of abundant sulfur-rich proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we observed and successfully modeled that the presence of oxygen leads to an offset  and/or scaling  of the expression levels of many genes, corroborating the existence of various types of regulation on various levels. the uncovered results find their origin in the systematic combinatorial setup of the well-defined cultivation conditions within the experiment. our tailored approach exploits the interrelatedness between the conditions and links the cultivation parameters to tf activity and gene expression behavior.

we compared our strategy to an approach that follows the exact same steps, but which does not exploit the systematic setup of the cultivation conditions. in short, when the interrelatedness between the conditions is not used, the original continuous expression levels are discretized without modeling the oxygen effect. results of this comparison indicate that more genes can be related to a particular cultivation parameter when incorporating the relations between the cultivation conditions. see table  <dig>  additionally, we can relate more tfs and tf pairs to the generated modules and achieve higher functional annotation enrichment. see additional files  <dig> and  <dig> . these results provide additional evidence for the validity of the adopted approach. moreover, the inclusion of the conditions within the computational framework accommodates the assessment of the direct effect of these conditions on gene expression, tf activity and other biological processes in the cell. this is in contrast to the currently used compendium approaches, where the relation between the cultivation conditions is ambiguous and can not be modeled. there, large heterogeneity in terms of the strain, growth rate, growth conditions, measuring technique and other environmental or measurement parameters may have a profound, but undetermined impact on the behavior of the cell and the resulting dataset. consequently, these approaches often resort to annotation databases to determine the functionality of a module or tf. for example, in the gram method  <cit> , where the functionality of a module is based on enrichment in mips functional categories, the tf hap <dig> was only related to respiration. we could, on other hand, not only demonstrate that oxygen plays an important role, but also identified the known effect of the extracellular glucose concentration on hap <dig> and its regulon.

in this study we identified many novel putative regulatory relationships. examples include the role of tye <dig> in regulating sulfur metabolism and the cross-regulation between phosphate and sulfate metabolism. given the quality and uniqueness of the dataset, many other clues about regulation mechanisms related to yeast's metabolism and respiration can still be extracted.

we believe that quantification of the complex relationships that control cellular adaptation to different environments necessitates well-designed and carefully controlled experiments. in this respect, the design of experimental setups, where interrelated cultivation conditions are systematically combined, is especially important. the analysis of the individual and combined effects of the cultivation parameters in such experiments will help to reveal the multi-faceted nature of cellular regulatory mechanisms.
