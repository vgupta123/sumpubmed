BACKGROUND
the majority of molecular studies of plant stress tolerance have been performed with arabidopsis thaliana, although it is not an extremophile and can therefore be expected to lack many protective mechanisms required to survive extreme environmental conditions. thellungiella salsuginea has therefore attracted increasing interest as an alternative plant model species that possesses the characteristics of an extremophile, i.e. high tolerance of salinity, freezing, nitrogen-deficiency and drought stress  <cit> . the genus thellungiella is part of the brassicaceae family and therefore related to arabidopsis <cit> . the species name has sometimes been used synonymously with thellungiella halophila, but it is clear now that three distinct thellungiella species  have to be distinguished  <cit> . t. salsuginea is also referred to as eutrema salsugineum, however, we prefer to stay with the older and better established species name as that is not in conflict with the taxonomy  <cit> . on the other hand, thellungiella parvula is not as closely related to these other species as previously thought and should be called schrenkiella parvula <cit> . however, to avoid unnecessary confusion in the assignment of sequence information, we have used the species names used in the respective publications in all comparisons with our data.

t. salsuginea resembles arabidopsis in many important features such as short life cycle, self-fertility and the possibility to transform plants by the floral-dip method  <cit> . while the genomes of t. salsuginea <cit>  and t. parvula <cit>  have recently been sequenced, important functional genomics tools such as dedicated microarrays are still lacking for these species.

arabidopsis-based microarrays  <cit>  and a cdna array comprising  <dig>  unique t. salsuginea ests  <cit>  have been used to profile the effects of abiotic stress conditions on the t. salsuginea transcriptome. however, t. salsuginea is not in the arabidopsis genus and therefore has several distinguishing genetic and developmental properties  <cit> . identity between the arabidopsis genome sequence and t. salsuginea ests  is between 95% and 60%, but there are also specific ests in t. salsuginea <cit> . importantly, analysis of t. salsuginea mrna using the affymetrix arabidopsis genechip ath <dig> produced signals significantly above background for only 20% of the probe sets  <cit> , indicating the necessity for a dedicated t. salsuginea microarray for cost-effective transcriptome studies.

transcriptome sequencing is playing an increasingly important role in functional genomic studies of organisms without full genome sequences . the  <dig> technology is an efficient and cost effective way to generate high-throughput est data for such organisms  <cit> , providing the possibility for de novo assembly of transcriptomes from uncharacterized genomes  <cit> .

large scale isolation of ests is a powerful approach for the discovery of novel genes, the investigation of genes of unknown function, comparative genomic studies and identification of exon/intron boundaries  <cit> . there are currently  <dig>  t. salsuginea est sequences in the genbank dbest  and  <dig>  full-length cdnas are available from riken  <cit> . these numbers are far smaller than for arabidopsis , indicating the need for further gene discovery and characterization in t. salsuginea.

here, we have sequenced, assembled and annotated the transcriptome of the t. salsuginea yukon accession using  <dig> pyrosequencing. on the basis of these transcriptome sequences, we have developed a dedicated t. salsuginea microarray using the agilent long oligonucleotide array platform. this array has been benchmarked against the corresponding arabidopsis array and tested in comparative cold acclimation experiments  <cit> .

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and transcriptome assembly
we constructed non-normalized and normalized cdna libraries of t. salsuginea from various tissues derived from soil- and hydroponically-grown plants, including rosette and cauline leaves, roots, flowers, and siliques of plants treated with cold, drought and salt to achieve comprehensive transcriptome information. using the gs flx  <dig> sequencer, we generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads from a normalized and non-normalized library, respectively, comprising  <dig>  mbp with an average read length of 464 bp . the average read length was greater for ests derived from the non-normalized library  than from the normalized library  and the proportion of reads shorter than 257 bp was larger for the normalized library compared to the non-normalized library , as a result of cdna fragmentation in the procedure for constructing normalized libraries.

we combined the  <dig> reads with  <dig>  publicly available t. salsuginea ests and performed a transcriptome assembly with mira  <cit> . this de-novo assembly of the combined libraries generated  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 567 bp . the contigs showed a similar trend of frequency distribution of average contig coverage  for three different assemblies . pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation  between contig length and contig average coverage . this result suggests that the consensus nucleotide sequences of long contigs are confidently supported with more reads than the shorter contigs. the assembly of the combined reads increased the number of contigs and average coverage , but the average contig length was smaller when compared to the non-normalized library . of  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   were unique and had not been reported before.

we further examined whether sequencing both a normalized and a non-normalized library increased the number of unique transcripts that were detected. the normalization procedure produced about 24%  unique contigs that were not found in the non-normalized library, while the non-normalized library yielded about 20%  unique contigs using blastn with e value threshold of 10- <dig>  this indicates that to approach full transcriptome information, the sequencing of both types of libraries is necessary. no consensus number was found for the matched contigs between the two libraries using blastn in reciprocal searches .

to assess the quality of the assembly, we predicted open reading frames  of the contigs and used blastx to align all contigs to the tair <dig> arabidopsis annotated protein database using an e-value threshold of 10- <dig>  of  <dig>  arabidopsis peptides,  <dig>  unique peptides were matched to contigs generated from the combined libraries , indicating a high quality of the transcriptome assembly.

gene discovery
the transcriptome assembly yielded  <dig>  contigs sharing more than 99% sequence identity and coverage with at least one other contig in the assembly, likely constituting alleles of the same genes  with single nucleotide polymorphysms . because the seed material was not derived from single seed descent, the plants used in the experiments were not genetically identical, making the presence of snps in this plant population likely. we therefore condensed these  <dig>  contigs into  <dig> clusters with ambiguous nucleotides at the snp sites, reducing the final number of unigenes to  <dig> . since t. salsuginea and arabidopsis are both members of the brassicaceae family, we estimated the number of t. salsuginea unigenes that were orthologous to arabidopsis genes using blastx. this identified  <dig>  unigenes as orthologs of arabidopsis genes, while approximately 25% were unique to t. salsuginea. no consensus overlap was found for the number of matched sequences between both species when a reciprocal search was performed, because every given reference sequence may hit more than one paralog in the other species, while also more than one homologous sequence in one species may hit a single sequence in the other species . the genome sequence of t. parvula was published recently  <cit>  and although t. salsuginea and t. parvula are related, about 26% of t. salsuginea unigenes have no counterparts in t. parvula, while 21% of the t. parvula genes have no orthologs in t. salsuginea , probably reflecting the fact that the relationship between t. salsuginea and t. parvula  is not as close as originally assumed. on the other hand, approximately 88%  of the t. salsuginea unigenes could be aligned to  <dig>  t. salsuginea genomic contig sequences comprising  <dig>  mbp of genome sequence  <cit>  using blastn with a stringent threshold .

more recently the t. salsuginea  genome sequence obtained by sanger sequencing technology has been published  <cit> . we estimated that 72%  of the gene models predicted from the genome were expressed under our experimental conditions . on the other hand,  <dig>  t. salsuginea yukon unigenes were best matched  with the shandong gene models . therefore,  <dig>  unigenes from the yukon accession have no counterpart among the predicted gene models from the shandong accession and may be yukon-specific transcripts . approximately  <dig> % of matched unigenes  were estimated to be full length in relation to the published gene models from the genome sequence .

we further investigated how many yukon unigenes were likely derived from gene duplication events in relation to shandong gene models. we assessed the sequence relationships between yukon accession unigenes and shandong accession gene models by blastn analysis . based on these criteria , we assessed whether the relationships were one-to-one , one-to-many , many-to-one , or many-to-many .  <dig> putatively duplicated yukon unigenes were identified in relation to shandong gene models. these unigenes were enriched with genes involved in protein synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, dna synthesis, light reaction of photosynthesis, regulation of transcription, redox and storage proteins .

functional annotation
sequence-based functional annotation of the  <dig>  unigenes was performed using mercator  <cit>  and mapman ontology  <cit>  to predict and classify the protein coding unigenes. the mercator tool predicts the function of input dna sequences by searching a variety of reference databases . subsequently, each input gene is assigned to one or more functional mapman bins based on the manually curated binning of the reference database entries  <cit> . we compared the distribution of gene functions and found that a large proportion of arabidopsis  and t. salsuginea unigenes  could not be classified to any functional bin . a large number of genes with known functions were classified in bins of protein, dna, rna, signaling, transport, stress, cell, development, photosynthesis and miscellaneous for arabidopsis  and t. salsuginea . the distribution of gene functions was similar in both species with similar proportions of genes for each bin except gene functions related to dna metabolism  and differences of about 2% between arabidopsis and t. salsuginea in bins for rna, protein and photosynthesis .

microrna prediction
higher plant transcriptomes contain a large number of non-coding rnas including microrna  that function in diverse regulatory processes that influence e.g. growth and development  <cit> . since primary mirna transcripts are polyadenylated  <cit>  it seemed possible that the t. salsuginea unigenes contain primary mirna transcripts that code for one or more mirna stem loops that could be further processed to mature mirnas. we scanned all unigenes using blastn with a threshold e-value of 10- <dig> against the complete set of mirna precursor transcripts from the plant mirna database  <cit>  and obtained  <dig> unigenes that putatively encode mirna precursor transcripts. the predicted target transcripts of the corresponding mirnas were classified according to their functions using mapman ontology and the predicted targets were compared with those of arabidopsis mirnas . the proportion of predicted targets in the different functional classes was generally lower for t. salsuginea than for arabidopsis except for target functions related to protein metabolism  and mitochondrial electron transport , where t. salsuginea showed higher proportions compared to arabidopsis.

genes encoding protein kinases and protein phosphatases
mitogen activated protein kinases  and mapk phosphatases are important components that mediate abiotic stress signaling in plant cells  <cit> . members of the families of protein tyrosine phosphatases , including dual specificity phosphatases  and protein phosphatases 2c  have been characterized as plant mapk phosphatases that regulate stress responses  <cit> . in the pp2c gene family the a-type pp2c phosphatases are generally upregulated in response to abscisic acid , whereas b-type pp2cs  have been characterized as mapk phosphatases  <cit> . since drought or salt stress induces aba biosynthesis in plants and mapk cascades have been related to salt stress tolerance  <cit> , it was of high interest to identify putative orthologous proteins of pp2cs and ptps/dsps, as well as mapks and mapk kinases  in the extremophile t. salsuginea.

individual t. salsuginea putative mapkk, mapk, pp2c, dsp and ptp proteins were designated according to the corresponding orthologous protein annotations in arabidopsis  and their phylogenetic relationships were visualized in unrooted phylogenetic trees . using  <dig> pp2cs from arabidopsis <cit>  as well as  <dig> and  <dig> pp2cs encoded in the t. salsuginea and t. parvula genomes  <cit> , respectively, led to the identification of  <dig> pp2c unigenes in the sequenced t. salsuginea ests that could be translated into  <dig> pp2c proteins .

all plant species studied so far revealed a single gene encoding a ptp  <cit> . correspondingly, a single unigene of a ptp was identified in the t. salsuginea transcriptome. however, two ptp genes were identified in the genome of t. parvula . reciprocal blast of  <dig> and  <dig> dsp sequences from arabidopsis <cit>  and t. parvula <cit> , respectively, revealed  <dig> dsp encoding unigenes  that code for 18 t. salsuginea dsp proteins .

the genome sequences of t. salsuginea and t. parvula <cit>  revealed  <dig> and  <dig> mapk encoding genes, respectively, in comparison to  <dig> mapks  <cit>  found in arabidopsis. here, analysis of mapks in the transcriptome of t. salsuginea identified  <dig> unigenes, which were translated into  <dig> putative mapk proteins . mapkk proteins are represented by  <dig> and  <dig> members in the genomes of arabidopis <cit>  and t. parvula <cit> , respectively. in the t. salsuginea trancriptome we identified eight ests representing mapkk, corresponding to six mapkk proteins .

genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant  proteins
the accumulation of lea proteins  has been associated with environmental stress conditions such as cold, drought, or desiccation in plants, as well as in some bacteria and invertebrates  <cit> . in arabidopsis  <dig> genes encoding lea proteins have been identified and all genes were shown to be expressed in some tissue and/or under particular stress conditions  <cit> . most of the arabidopsis lea proteins were predicted to be highly hydrophilic, intrinsically disordered proteins. since lea proteins are generally assumed to play important roles in cellular stress tolerance, it was of interest to identify potential orthologous proteins in the extremophile t. salsuginea. therefore, the  <dig> arabidopsis lea proteins were reciprocally compared by blastx  with the translated unigenes. this resulted in  <dig> putative t. salsuginea lea protein sequences . they were aligned with the arabidopsis lea proteins using clustalw and an unrooted dendogram was drawn  assigning the putative lea proteins to the corresponding pfam domain/motif groups . due to high similarity at the protein sequence level, these proteins were condensed to  <dig> protein sequences that showed distinct models . for example, one of the best characterized arabidopsis lea proteins is cor15a  which clustered with three orthologous t. salsuginea proteins  encoded by distinct unigenes. however, multiple protein sequence alignment showed that amino acid sequences translated from thellun_all_rep_c <dig>  and thellun_all_rep_c <dig>  were highly similar to thellun_all_rep_c <dig>  which is the longest of the three translated polypeptides. we therefore chose translated frame + <dig> of thellun_all_rep_c <dig> as the representative cor15a orthologous protein in t. salsuginea .

following this strategy for all  <dig> putative t. salsuginea lea proteins identified  <dig> arabidopsis lea proteins without an orthologous protein in the t. salsuginea transcriptome. however, a blastn search  revealed the presence of genes encoding  <dig> of these proteins in the t. salsuginea genome. for example, there were no apparent orthologs of lea_ <dig> proteins among the unigenes, but the blastn search of the gene sequences  against the t. salsuginea genome retrieved two genomic sequences , indicating that two lea_ <dig> proteins are encoded in the t. salsuginea genome, but probably not expressed under our experimental conditions. lea_ <dig> and dehydrin are the two largest groups of lea proteins in arabidopsis and this was also true for t. salsuginea with  <dig> lea_ <dig> proteins in both species. interestingly, t. salsuginea contains more dehydrins  than arabidopsis. this is due to the fact that some arabidopsis lea proteins were represented by several t. salsuginea orthologs. for instance, lea <dig>  and lea <dig>  were each represented by four distinct protein sequences and several others by three .

overall, the majority of putative t. salsuginea lea proteins showed negative gravy  values indicating the expected high hydrophilicity . since a precise in-vivo function has not been established for any arabidopsis lea protein, it is currently impossible to evaluate the functional significance of the multiple orthologous t. salsuginea proteins.

design and performance of a dedicated t. salsuginea microarray
between  <dig> and  <dig> 60-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed for each t. salsuginea unigene, depending on the length of the predicted gene. with this oligonucleotide sequence information as input, 400 k arrays were produced by agilent. a pre-selection strategy   <cit>  was used to select the best-performing probes by hybridizing either crna derived from pooled total rna  or genomic dna to these arrays. on the basis of the hybridization signal strength, the  <dig>  best-performing probes were selected.  <dig>  probes were selected on the basis of their hybridization signals with the crna sample and  <dig>  additional probes were derived from the hybridization with genomic dna. using the agilent earray platform  <cit> , 44 k arrays were produced from these oligonucleotide sequences. for  <dig>  unigenes, the number of features on the array allowed the design of two different probes for the same contig, while for the remaining  <dig>  unigenes only one probe was designed. the resulting  <dig>  probes therefore represented  <dig>  unigenes.

to test the newly designed arrays, they were hybridized with total rna derived from control  or 14-day cold acclimated  t. salsuginea plants from three independent biological experiments. spot intensities between replicates were highly correlated with r-values of pearson correlations between  <dig>  and  <dig> , p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . in addition, the log2-transformed fold change in hybridization signals between samples from non-acclimated and cold acclimated plants for the  <dig>  pairs of probes targeting the same unigene were also highly correlated . these results validate the probe design and selection with the pss method.

to further examine the quality of the t. salsuginea array and to assess whether hybridization results from a dedicated array are superior to cross-species hybridization using the arabidopsis array from the same manufacturer, we performed reciprocal array hybridizations. in this experiment, rna from the yukon accession of t. salsuginea and rna from the col- <dig> accession of arabidopsis were both hybridized to the agilent t. salsuginea and arabidopsis arrays. for both species, rna was extracted from acclimated and non-acclimated plants from three independent biological replicates. the comparison between the performance of the two arrays was limited to a set of probes that represent genes that are highly similar between the two species. these genes were identified using blastx with a threshold e-value of 10- <dig> that resulted in  <dig>  orthologous genes. the signal intensities  of the corresponding probes were significantly correlated  between the t. salsuginea and arabidopsis arrays when hybridized with identical rna samples. however, closer examination of these correlations revealed that a substantial proportion of probes yielded very low signal intensities in cross-species hybridizations. for example, when rna from non-acclimated t. salsuginea plants was hybridized to arabidopsis arrays , this yielded  <dig>  genes with log <dig> signal intensities below  <dig>  while the log <dig> signal intensities were above  <dig> when identical rna samples were hybridized to t. salsuginea arrays.

significantly, the distribution of raw signal intensities from all probes on the arrays revealed a bimodal distribution  <cit>  with a dominant density peak at high signal intensities  and a minor peak at low signal intensities  for the same-species array hybridizations . in contrast, cross-species array hybridizations yielded predominantly low signal intensities , suggesting that these hybridizations were dominated by non-specific signals.

in fact, approximately half of the probes were detected as background signals  when t. salsuginea rna was hybridized to arabidopsis arrays and 58%  of the genes differentially expressed during cold acclimation that were detected using t. salsuginea arrays were not identified as significantly changed using arabidopsis arrays . a similar situation was evident when col- <dig> rna was hybridized to both arrays, where 82%  of the genes that were found significantly cold-regulated using the same-species arrays showed no significant regulation in cross-species array hybridizations .

to facilitate data visualization and biological interpretation of array hybridization results, a t. salsuginea ontology/mapping file  was developed by transferring the arabidopsis mapman ontology  <cit>  to the t. salsuginea transcripts for use with the mapman software  <cit> .

mapping of cold-responsive genes from same-species microarrays to the mapman ontology showed several changes in the expression of genes related to primary and secondary metabolisms, and photosynthesis . the proportion of cold-responsive genes in different functional groups was tested for significant deviation from the expected value for all genes in these groups represented on the arrays. mapman functional groups that were significantly  under- or over-represented were identified using fisher’s exact test with false discovery rate corrected p-values  <cit> . many functional groups were affected for either up- or down-regulated genes in t. salsuginea plants cold acclimated at 4°c for two weeks . the functional groups that were most significantly affected when considering cold-repressed genes were photosynthesis , cell wall  and hormones . the most affected functional groups for cold-induced genes were glycolysis , stress  and biodegradation of xenobiotics . the genes in the stress bin include  <dig> genes classified into the sub-bin stress.abiotic.cold . these results suggest that the newly designed t. salsuginea array reliably detected genes or pathways that were known to be differentially affected on the transcript level in arabidopsis during plant cold acclimation  <cit> .

discussion
t. salsuginea has many features similar to arabidopsis and is in addition considered an “extremophile” with a higher tolerance to various abiotic stresses and has therefore been proposed as an alternative model species to arabidopsis <cit> . while the genomes of t. salsuginea and of the related species t. parvula have recently been sequenced  <cit> , genome annotation is still far from complete and, due to the low number of ests available, evidence for transcriptional activity is also scarce for most genes. in addition, the effective use of t. salsuginea for functional genomics investigations of mechanisms of plant abiotic stress tolerance is severely hampered by a lack of affordable tools for genome-wide gene expression studies. we therefore used next generation sequencing to obtain comprehensive information about the t. salsuginea transcriptome and used this information for gene annotation and the development of a dedicated microarray for global expression studies. to cover the transcriptome as fully as possible, we performed  <dig> pyrosequencing on ests generated from both a non-normalized and a normalized library synthesized from rna samples pooled from a wide range of plant samples from different developmental stages and from plants grown under different abiotic stress conditions. although the number of reads obtained from the normalized library was only about half of that obtained from the non-normalized library, both libraries yielded a large number of unique sequences that were not detected in the other library, indicating that sequencing of normalized and non-normalized libraries is necessary to obtain optimal coverage of a transcriptome.

a combination of  <dig>  publicly available ests and more than  <dig> million new sequence reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs for the prediction of gene functions. of these contigs,  <dig>  were novel because they were not covered by publicly available t. salsuginea ests. in total, the number of publicly available t. salsuginea unigenes increased more than 3-fold  with the present study. the number of genes estimated from the two draft genomes of t. salsuginea is  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit> , while the draft genome of t. parvula contains  <dig>  genes  <cit> . this suggests that the unigenes identified in this study represent a comprehensive t. salsuginea transcriptome. the average contig/unigene length in our assembly is 567 bp, which is shorter than the length of the predicted shandong gene models . the likely reason for this discrepancy is the fragmentation procedure necessary for the construction of normalized cdna libraries. nevertheless, more than 50% of our unigenes are full length  based on the blastn alignment . in addition,  <dig> % of our unigenes  were mapped to shandong gene models and  <dig> %  were mapped to the shandong genomic sequence  <cit> . these results indicate that most of our sequence assembly is correct based on its high similarity to a closely related accession.

many snps were found between our yukon unigenes and the shandong gene models  <cit>  when the yukon unigenes were aligned with the reference shandong gene models . the significance of the putative snps in the context of abiotic stress tolerance or other phenotypic variation between the yukon and shandong accessions remains to be determined.

based on the mapman ontology  <cit> , functional annotation of both t. salsuginea unigenes and arabidopsis genes revealed similar proportions of genes in each functional group, with the exception of genes annotated as encoding proteins with a function in photosynthesis, which were more abundant in t. salsuginea, and genes encoding proteins annotated as functioning in dna metabolism, which were less abundant. a similar observation was also made when we identified  <dig>  yukon unigenes that were likely derived from gene duplication events relative to shandong gene models . these duplicated unigenes map for most of their length  over shandong genes and are significantly enriched for functional categories of protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, photosynthesis and abiotic/biotic stress . the higher abundance of photosynthesis-related genes, together with the large number of such genes that were found to be regulated during cold acclimation in the microarray study, may be related to the importance of an effective regulation of photosynthesis for the abiotic stress tolerance of plants to sustain growth and avoid oxidative damage .

the percentage of genes in different functional groups in t. salsuginea that were predicted to be targeted by mirnas was generally lower than the corresponding percentage in arabidopsis, except for target functions related to protein metabolism and mitochondrial electron transport, where t. salsuginea showed much higher proportions. whether any of the relevant mirnas play a role in abiotic stress tolerance, however, remains to be investigated. in addition, some genes encoding lea proteins were present in higher copy numbers of orthologous genes in the t. salsuginea than in the arabidopsis genome. this is in agreement with the observed higher frequency of gene duplications in the t. salsuginea <cit>  and t. parvula genomes  <cit> . this may suggest that both thellungiella species retained a higher fraction of duplicated genes since the last whole genome duplication event  <cit>  or after tandem duplications that diverged in function  as an adaptive strategy to survive in habitats with harsher environmental stress conditions than arabidopsis <cit> .

on the other hand, the analysis of pp2c, ptp and mapk in t. salsuginea, t. parvula and a. thaliana indicated very similar numbers of putative genes and proteins of these families in all three species. this may indicate that the retention of duplicated genes was highly selective, a hypothesis that was also put forward in the most recent t. salsuginea genome sequencing study  <cit> .

the assembled unigenes were used for the construction of a 44 k agilent microarray that showed superior specificity for t. salsuginea compared to arabidopsis samples, high reproducibility and the ability to detect the complex cold-acclimation induced changes in transcript abundance. in addition, it showed interesting differences in the cold regulated transcript patterns between arabidopsis and t. salsuginea. interestingly, a previous paper provided evidence for possible differences in the metabolic adaptation strategies of the two species  <cit> , based on targeted biochemical measurements of compatible solutes. in the future, the availability of microarrays will allow us to investigate such differences in adaptation strategies at the functional genomics level.

the t. salsuginea microarray consists of  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes representing  <dig>  unigenes. based on a blastn search of all unigenes against the t. salsuginea genomic contig sequences  <cit> ,  <dig>  t. salsuginea unigenes were aligned to the published genome sequence. the remaining  <dig>  unigenes showed no significant blast hits and filtering out unigenes that were not represented on the array still left  <dig>  unigenes that had produced above-background signal intensities in the hybridization experiments performed during the pre-selection procedure. likely reasons for this discrepancy are that approximately 10% of the genome have not been sequenced yet  <cit> , that the corresponding transcripts are encoded by genes that consist of short exons and long introns that may result in low blastn hit score values, or that these unigenes have relatively high sequencing or sequence assembly errors. the latter point may have resulted in the relatively high fraction of 71%  among these unigenes that were annotated as having an unknown function, while for the whole unigene set this fraction was about 50%.

to assess whether the use of a dedicated t. salsuginea microarray really yields data of a higher quality than cross-species hybridization on an arabidopsis array from the same manufacturer, we hybridized identical samples from either non- or cold-acclimated plants on same-species t. salsuginea and cross-species arabidopsis arrays. in the reciprocal experiment, arabidopsis samples were also hybridized to the same set of arrays. the results demonstrated the expected bimodal signal distribution  <cit> . however, only signals obtained from same-species array hybridizations showed a distribution consistent with a high proportion of specific hybridization reactions and a low proportion of non-specific hybridizations and noise. in fact, using the 25-mer oligonucleotide-based affymetrix genechip ath <dig>  only 20% of the probes produced signals significantly above background with t. salsuginea samples  <cit> . in contrast, using longer oligonucleotide probes  showed that approximately 80% of the probes on the arabidopsis microarray  <cit>  yielded significant signals after hybridization with t. salsuginea samples. however, the detection of differentially expressed t. salsuginea genes was limited to arabidopsis homologs with an overall sequence identity of 92-95% with this type of array  <cit> . obviously, the expression of t. salsuginea-specific unigenes could not be detected using arabidopsis-based arrays and approximately 58%  of the cold-responsive genes detected using the same-species array were not identified as differentially expressed from the arabidopsis array, further stressing the need for a dedicated t. salsuginea microarray for the reliable identification of stress-regulated genes at the genomic level.

one of the challenges faced when using microarrays is to visualize the expression data in an efficient way  <cit> . to make the t. salsuginea microarray as useful as possible for the research community, we adapted the mapman visualization  <cit>  and the robin  <cit>  and mefisto statistical analysis tools to t. salsuginea by designing a mapping file for the annotated unigenes by transfer into the mapman ontology  <cit> . to validate its performance, the t. salsuginea microarray was used to identify cold-responsive genes in comparison to arabidopsis. the results were visualized using the mapman tool. further functional analysis was provided by statistical tests for the significant under- or over-represention of cold regulated genes in different functional groups. these results demonstrate that the newly designed t. salsuginea microarray reliably detects genes and pathways that are known to be differentially affected during cold acclimation in arabidopsis and other plants. we are currently using the t. salsuginea array to investigate the cold and salt responsiveness of the t. salsuginea transcriptomes in the diverse set of accessions from all three thellungiella species recently described  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
while model species such as arabidopsis are valuable tools to study many important traits in plants, additional models are needed to investigate the adaptation mechanisms to more extreme environmental conditions. t. salsuginea is such an emerging model species and the present study provides the first comprehensive transcriptome information for this species. the large number of additional publicly available unigene sequences will greatly facilitate genome annotation. in addition, the newly designed and validated genome-wide microarray for t. salsuginea, which will be commercially available, will be an important tool for future functional genomics investigations of plant stress tolerance. also, we hope that the approaches developed in this study will help in the establishment of similar genomic tools for other non-model species with interesting physiological and ecological traits.
