BACKGROUND
forward genetics is a way to gain new knowledge about gene function. however, weak phenotypes are often overlooked. the reverse genetics approach is a way to look more closely at possible phenotypes especially if data about mutated genes are available. the medicago truncatula seed line, 2ha differs from its wild type  progenitor line, jemalong, in its ability to produce greatly increased numbers of somatic embryos in tissue culture  <cit> . investigation of gene expression points toward candidate genes that are involved in the process of somatic embryogenesis. the ability to produce somatic embryos is often species- and even cultivar-dependent, and the search for key genes in this process has revealed several genes that stimulate or inhibit se in different plant species  <cit> .

ethylene is a plant hormone that is involved in different developmental processes: root elongation  <cit> , lateral root emergence  <cit> , nodulation  <cit> , senescence  <cit> , fruit ripening  <cit>  and se  <cit> . the ethylene insensitive <dig> -like  gene family in arabidopsis has been well-characterised using mutants and overexpression experiments. mutations in ein <dig> and eil <dig> genes cause strong ethylene insensitivity, whereas mutations of other eil family members are related to weaker phenotypes, supporting the idea that they are playing an accompanying role during ethylene responses  <cit> . the triple response test was developed in order to distinguish mutants impaired in response to ethylene. it involves germination of seedlings in the presence of exogenous ethylene or its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid . under these conditions, wild type seedlings display the triple response phenotype of shorter, thicker, and overly-bent hypocotyls. the widely accepted model of ethylene signalling indicates that in the absence of ethylene, ein <dig> and other eil proteins are continuously degraded. the binding of ethylene to its receptor complex leads to stabilisation of these proteins and elicits the downstream ethylene response. ein <dig> and eil <dig> are transcription factors that bind to promoters of erf genes and regulate their expression. erfs are also transcription factors, and they in turn promote ethylene responses by binding to promoters of other genes  <cit> .

in this study, genes showing differential expression in microarray studies of 2ha and jemalong four week old cultures were analysed with about  <dig> genes up-regulated greater than  <dig>  times in 2ha. only a few genes were down-regulated in 2ha. one of these, an ein3-like gene  showed a large decrease in expression in 2ha plants. different aspects of ethylene insensitivity of the 2ha line have been analysed, and weak ethylene insensitivity has been confirmed. analysis of phenotypic segregation, absence of mutations in its dna and presence of other phenotypes in 2ha prompted us to further investigate epigenetic differences between 2ha and wild type. tissue culture is known to be able to induce a number of genomic perturbations and epigenetic mutations  <cit> . we found many examples of differential dna methylation between 2ha and the wt plants using an arbitrarily-primed, methylation-sensitive pcr profiling method called amplified methylation polymorphism   <cit> . differences in methylation of the mteil <dig> gene between the 2ha and wt plants were also found. the methylation of mteil <dig> in 2ha was associated with increased abundance of a small rna with homology to the 3’ region of mteil <dig>  based on all the data accumulated, we propose that the 2ha seed line is an epigenetic variant of wt jemalong, and some of its distinctive phenotypes are most likely due to down-regulation of mteil <dig>  the proposed epigenetic nature of the phenotypes is discussed.

RESULTS
comparison of gene expression between embryogenic and non-embryogenic tissue cultures
in order to characterise the 2ha line more fully, a comparison of gene expression was performed using the affymetrix gene chip. calli of 2ha and jemalong were collected after four weeks of culture, shortly before somatic embryos are visible to the naked eye in 2ha. we have previously used transition stage cultures from single 2ha cells  <cit> , and this stage had not been previously examined for 2ha and wild type gene expression comparisons  <cit> . there were  <dig> genes up-regulated > <dig>  times in 2ha embryonic tissue cultures compared to jemalong but only seven genes were down-regulated > <dig>  times. thirty four transcripts were up-regulated more than two times in 2ha cultures and only two transcripts down-regulated more than two times. all these differentially expressed genes  plotted against their fold change values are shown in figure  <dig> 

transcripts that were up- or down-regulated at least  <dig> times were analysed in more detail . the annotation and expression of each of these transcripts was checked against available data on the medicago truncatula gene expression atlas   <cit> , which shows gene expression in different plant organs and under various experimental conditions. the corresponding tc or est sequences were retrieved and predicted amino acid sequences from these were used in blastp searches to find predicted protein domains and matches to other known proteins . analysis using the m. truncatula gene expression atlas indicated that of the  <dig> transcripts upregulated in 2ha,  <dig> were classed as legume-specific,  <dig> showed high expression in nodules with four of these classed as nodule-specific, ten showed high expression in developing seed and, three were predicted transcription factors. seven predicted transcripts encoded transposase-like proteins containing either a hat family dimerisation and/or a bed zinc finger domain. the hat family dimerisation domain is found in transposases belonging to the hat superfamily  <cit> . the bed zinc finger domain is a dna binding domain also found in transposases and in chromatin-boundary-element binding proteins  <cit> .

validation of microarray results by rt- qpcr
in order to validate the microarray results, we checked expression of seven up-regulated  and two down-regulated predicted transcripts in leaves, callus and ses by rt- qpcr. two of the up-regulated 2ha transcripts  expressed throughout the culture period are putative transposases. the mtr.  <dig> .s <dig> transcript is highly expressed in the 2ha callus phase and mtr. <dig> .s1is highly expressed in the transition to embryogenesis phase. both are expressed in nodulation .

both of the predicted down-regulated transcripts demonstrated nearly identical results in rt- qpcr . pcr amplification with different combinations of primers  followed by sequencing revealed that the two transcripts were part of the same ein3-like gene  which we called mteil <dig> and deposited as accession number gq <dig> in ncbi genbank. this ein3-like gene was also listed as down-regulated in 2 week 2ha embryogenic calli but was not studied in detail  <cit> . the 2 week stage is an early callus phase when the induction of se is starting while week  <dig> is when the transition from callus to embryogenesis is occurring  <cit> .

analysis of the ein3-like gene mteil <dig> and its protein
it was of interest that only a single gene was down-regulated more than two times and this gene was involved in ethylene signalling. ethylene has been shown to be a significant regulator of se  <cit> . expression analysis with rt- qpcr for the down-regulated mteil <dig> transcript was also carried out using material from different organs of 2ha and wt plants . expression of this gene was increased during growth of jemalong callus but remained low in the case of 2ha . the difference in expression between these two lines in callus was up to  <dig> times.

additional ein3-like proteins were predicted by the fgenesh program  from available m. truncatula genomic sequences. protein alignment and phylogenetic analysis of ein3-like proteins from m. truncatula, and additional proteins from arabidopsis thaliana and some other plant species, was then performed . one of the m. truncatula ein3-like proteins, designated mteil <dig> , showed close homology to mteil <dig> and to previously characterised eil proteins from mung bean  <cit> .

weak ethylene insensitivity of the 2ha line
given the down-regulation of mteil <dig>  we examined the 2ha line for phenotypes associated with ethylene insensitivity. we also examined sickle mutants of m. truncatula in parallel to wt and 2ha, as these have very strong ethylene-insensitive phenotypes. the sickle mutation in the ein <dig> gene, biochemically, is upstream of eil genes in the ethylene response pathway in m. truncatula <cit> .

the ethylene triple response test revealed no significant differences between jemalong and 2ha at 10 μm of the ethylene precursor acc. however, at lower levels of acc , the bending of germinated cotyledons was distinctly different between jemalong and 2ha . root growth was retarded in a similar way in 2ha and jemalong even at  <dig>  μm acc. however, roots of seven-day old seedlings grown without addition of acc were more elongated in 2ha than in wt. 2ha in this case demonstrated an intermediate phenotype between wt and the strong ethylene insensitive mutant sickle .

because ethylene insensitivity strongly affects nodulation, and sickle forms more nodules than the wild type plants  <cit> , we carried out nodulation tests on 2ha plants. 2ha formed similar number of nodules as wt plants in standard conditions. addition of the ethylene inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine  caused a two-fold increase in nodulation for both wt and 2ha plants , and the nodulation zone widened in avg-treated roots of both lines, although this difference was only significant for the wild type . however, addition of acc, which completely inhibited nodule formation in wt , did not abolish nodule formation in 2ha plants . the nodules that formed on acc-treated 2ha were in a narrow cluster on the root . lateral root number was inversely affected by ethylene compared to nodule number. while acc stimulated the total numbers of lateral roots, avg did not have a significant effect on total lateral root number . however, we did observe a change in the proportion of short emerged compared to elongated lateral roots between wild type and 2ha plants. the avg-treated roots were characterized by increased short lateral roots, whereas acc increased the number of both short and elongated lateral roots . though the effects of ethylene on lateral root numbers were similar for both plant lines, acc only caused a significant increase in short lateral root numbers in wild type plants, while the increased caused by acc in the 2ha mutant was not significant  . in contrast, acc did not cause a significant increase in the number of longer  lateral roots in the wild type, while in 2ha mutants the increase in longer lateral roots was significant  . these results suggest that 2ha has altered ethylene sensitivity for both nodule and lateral root formation. for lateral root development, the elongation step seemed to be the stage differentially affected in the 2ha mutant.

other developmental phenotypes of the 2ha line were consistent with ethylene insensitivity. delayed senescence of flowers, a very pronounced feature of sickle, was regularly observed for 2ha but never for wt jemalong. it was also evident that calli of 2ha and sickle grow better on media supplemented with 1 μm acc compared to wt calli growth which was negatively affected by this treatment. . all of the phenotypic differences between the 2ha and wt that could be explained by ethylene insensitivity are summarised in table  <dig>

segregation analysis of the 2ha phenotypes
in order to gain an insight into the molecular nature of the 2ha phenotype, we followed mteil <dig> transcript levels in segregating populations of f <dig> and f <dig> plants from a cross between wt jemalong and 2ha. forty five and eighty five individual plants were analysed in the f <dig> and f <dig> generations, respectively . also, nine plants were assessed for jemalong and 2ha as controls . it was clear from progeny analysis that the 2ha phenotype was not inherited as a one or two mendelian gene model, as the segregation in the selfed progeny of f1or f <dig> heterozygotes was about 1: <dig> . at the same time the ability to produce se is a dominant feature with a segregation ratio of 3: <dig> . se segregation data confirms previous data from crosses between non-embryogenic jemalong and the highly embryogenic 2ha seed line; f <dig> is dominant for se and f <dig> gives a 3: <dig> ratio  <cit>  using 2ha classes defined by rose et al.  <dig>  <cit> .

the molecular basis of the 2ha phenotypes
initially, we examined large-scale rearrangements in the 2ha karyotype compared to wild type, and no differences were found . next, we used amp, an arbitrarily-primed, methylation-sensitive pcr  <cit>  to assess genome-wide dna methylation patterns in 2ha and wt . it was clear that many dna methylation changes had occurred in 2ha, without detectable genome sequence change. in order to further investigate the molecular basis of ethylene insensitivity, we sequenced the full-length mteil <dig> gene from two 2ha and two jemalong plants, and found no nucleotide differences between them. we also sequenced the promoter  of this gene, which also revealed no differences between 2ha and jemalong. as there were no nucleotide mutations in eil <dig> we checked expression of ein <dig>  mteil <dig> and a predicted ein3-like gene in cultured wt jemalong and 2ha. no differences were found between wt jemalong and 2ha plants .

data from amp pcr, together with the absence of a nucleotide mutation in mteil <dig>  prompted a detailed examination of dna methylation in mteil <dig>  we compared methylation of mteil <dig> and its promoter in leaves of 2ha and jemalong. genomic dna was digested by methylation-sensitive endonucleases and used for qpcr with primers surrounding their sites. we found no differences between wt and 2ha in methylation of the promoter of mteil <dig>  methylation of 2ha and wt jemalong coding regions was different, with strong methylation in the case of 2ha but not jemalong . bisulphite sequencing using dna from jemalong and 2ha plants confirmed methylation profiling demonstrated in the digestion based assay and showed additional methylation in the 2ha coding region but not in jemalong .

the methylation of coding regions is commonly associated with post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> , so we carried out investigations to identify any small rna species that could contribute to the silencing. a 40-nucleotide mteil <dig> tiling array with 20-nucleotide overlaps was hybridised with small rna from 2ha and wild type. an antisense small regulatory rna more abundant in 2ha was identified by the hybridization with the sequence “ttccctttgggccaaaaaggtgtattcaattttcttcgac” located at the 3’ end of mteil <dig> . using qpcr and a series of overlapping primers, a putative small regulatory rna was narrowed down to a shorter region within the  <dig> nt sequence , and the difference in expression of the small antisense rna between 2ha and jemalong was confirmed .

discussion
ethylene insensitivity of 2ha plants
down-regulation of an ein3-like transcript in 2ha plants was found in all organs checked and led to further investigation of this gene and possible phenotypes caused by the absence of its expression. this transcript, gq <dig>  is a homologue of arabidopsis ein <dig> and we called it mteil <dig>  the family of eil genes in arabidopsis is involved in the ethylene response pathway. among six ein3–like genes in arabidopsis, only two  are crucial for the ethylene response and double ein3/eil <dig> mutants demonstrate complete ethylene insensitivity. at the same time, several other mutants of arabidopsis were found that demonstrated weak ethylene insensitivity  <cit> . the ein <dig> and ein3-like gene function in arabidopsis is mainly regulated through the stability of the corresponding proteins  <cit> .

the 2ha line demonstrated weak ethylene insensitivity compared to wt plants , most probably due to down-regulation of the mteil <dig> gene. most interesting is the ability to form nodules in the presence of an exogenously added ethylene precursor . the difference between 2ha and wt is not as pronounced in standard growth conditions except for the increased main root elongation of seven day old seedlings. similar to arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutant nomenclature, we propose that the 2ha seed line has characteristics of a medicago eil <dig> mutant.

endogenous concentrations of ethylene are low and the whole plant system is well tuned, so small differences  can lead to complete inhibition of nodulation  or to a two times increase in the number of nodules . ethylene possibly works to control the number of infection sites, so mild attenuation of its action leads to an increased number of nodules without affecting the general system of nodule development  <cit> . the more pronounced widening of the nodulation zone by avg in wild type compared to 2ha is reminiscent of the inability of avg to widen the nodulation zone in the ethylene insensitive sickle mutant  <cit> . weak ethylene-insensitivity could be an advantage for plants as they could form nodules even under stress conditions when the ethylene concentration is elevated. the effects of ethylene on lateral root initiation and emergence was less pronounced, but showed significant relative differences between wild type and 2ha. differential effects of ethylene on lateral root initiation and emergence have been observed in arabidopsis, where high concentrations of acc inhibited the initiation of lateral root primordia but promoted their elongation. low acc concentration had opposite effects, suggesting a narrow window of optimum ethylene concentration  <cit> . we found that in wild type plants, a relatively high  concentration of acc caused a significant increase in short lateral roots, but a non-significant increase in longer lateral roots, opposite to the effect in arabidopsis, suggesting different optimum levels of ethylene between medicago and arabidopsis. surprisingly, avg had a similar effect to acc on short lateral numbers, underlining the importance of ethylene acting in a strict concentration window in the root. the 2ha line showed a different response to acc compared to the wild type, with significant increase in elongated but not short lateral roots. this could indicate a different optimum window of ethylene in 2ha compared to wild type plants.

gene expression differences between embryogenic calli 2ha and non-embryogenic calli wt
transcription profiling obtained through microarrays revealed a relatively small number of differentially expressed genes. at the same time there was general up-regulation of transcription in 2ha compared to wt  that could have a cumulative effect on cell fate and mediate further developmental changes  <cit> . up-regulation of transposon-like genes with bed and hat domains that we called bedhat <dig> and bedhat  <dig> , found in 2ha culture , could be an indicator of the general “openness” of chromatin in 2ha tissue cultures  <cit> . interestingly, bh <dig> is active in zygotic embryogenesis and bh <dig> is up-regulated during nodule formation and zygotic embryogenesis according to the medicago gene expression atlas  <cit> . earlier in culture in the early callus phase  there were more up-regulated and down regulated genes at the  <dig> times cut-off, but over  <dig> % of probe sets were similar in 2ha and jemalong. however there were transposases and nodulins up-regulated and the ein3-like gene was down-regulated  <cit> . it does seem that arrays over weekly periods  would provide additional insights.

among  <dig> transcripts that showed ≥ <dig> fold up-regulation in 2ha embryogenic 4-week calli we identified several embryo-specific genes, even though their expression is probably limited to a small number of cells. these genes could be good markers for further investigation of se. several embryo-specific genes and a number of genes that are preferentially expressed during zygotic embryogenesis as well as during nodule formation  were also up-regulated in 2ha tissue cultures or in se. this suggests a commonality between these three processes: zygotic embryogenesis, somatic embryogenesis and nodule formation. in all these cases, re-differentiation is required and a particular level of pluripotency or “stemness” is necessary.

relationship between the se phenotype of 2ha and mteil <dig> expression
f <dig> plants from a cross between 2ha and wt with a high level of mteil <dig> expression are still able to develop somatic embryos . therefore, low mteil1expression does not appear to be an absolute requirement for se. the development of the 2ha seedline involved regeneration of plants from somatic embryos in tissue culture while the segregation of se and eil <dig> traits were limited to tissue culture studies, so the success rate of plant regeneration from somatic embryos is not known. as the original 2ha line has a low level of mteil <dig> expression, there is still a possibility that modified ethylene signalling is playing a role in the process of 2ha development from somatic embryos and further investigations are required in order to find why these two phenotypes co-exist in the 2ha seed line. an interesting observation in b. napus se  <cit> , is that from four plant lines which demonstrated se, the most highly embryogenic was the line that also demonstrated delayed senescence of flowers – an ethylene insensitivity phenotype. we have observed that 2ha has delayed senescence of petals. it has also been shown in arabidopsis that osmotic stress induces ethylene in leaves, without up-regulation of ein <dig>  and meristemoids are induced  <cit> . ethylene has been shown to be an activator of the transcription factor mtserf <dig> that is essential for se in m. truncatula <cit>  as well as in soybean and arabidopsis  <cit> . as the signalling through mteil <dig> is questionable in 2ha it could occur through the closely related mteil <dig> whose expression is not down-regulated.

toward molecular characterisation of the 2ha seed line - the mteil <dig> gene
the mteil <dig> protein clusters together with mteil <dig> and their closest homologs are two eil proteins from mung bean . these two proteins are probably equally involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway as proposed in the original paper  <cit> . a similar pair is formed by ein <dig> and eil <dig> from arabidopsis. in arabidopsis, eil <dig> works co-operatively with, but distinctly from ein <dig> to regulate a myriad of ethylene responses  <cit> . protein alignment shows that both mteils contain the same functional domains that have been previously found  in mung bean and arabidopsis  <cit> . the only difference found between mteil <dig> and mteil <dig> is in the terminal domain where they have nine and six gln/asn residues respectively.

the mteil <dig> gene and its promoter were sequenced but no mutations were found. digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases revealed differences in methylation between 2ha and jemalong plants for the mteil <dig> gene. dna methylation affected the coding region of mteil <dig> in 2ha but not the promoter. this was associated with increased abundance of a small anti-sense rna in 2ha as demonstrated by hybridisation to a tiled array of mteil <dig>  and rt-qpcr confirmed the existence of this small rna. it is possible then that the driver of mteil <dig> down regulation is a mirna that targets the 3’-utr and causes the down-regulation. to be unequivocal with this latter conclusion an anti-mirna approach would be required.

dna methylation analysis and the epigenetic nature of 2ha phenotypes
differences in dna methylation between jemalong and 2ha genomes were obtained in the amp experiment . even though amp is able to sample only a small part of the genome, it was a good indicator of widespread differences in dna methylation between wt and 2ha. at the same time, the amp profiles were consistent with the isogenicity of 2ha and jemalong genomes because no differences were found in profiles for undigested dna. dna methylation changes as a result of in vitro culture are well documented  <cit> , but there is little work on changes in individual genes resulting in a phenotypic change. though regions that are hypermethylated in 2ha  are present, hypomethylated regions in 2ha may be responsible for the up-regulation of transposon-like genes  found in 2ha culture. global hypomethylation changes in reprogramming to somatic embryogenesis in pollen have been documented  <cit> . our observations are consistent with the origin of 2ha by selection from a regenerated plant that passed through a cycle of tissue culture  <cit>  and suggests that epigenetic changes in culture directed at specific genes can be fixed in regenerated plants.

transcriptional gene silencing  and posttranscriptional gene silencing  can interconvert during tissue culture  <cit> . their dominance and segregation in progeny are quite different from each other and not simply mendelian in ratio. such processes could be responsible for the appearance of the 2ha seed line.

CONCLUSIONS
microarray-based transcription profiling revealed only one gene that was down-regulated > <dig> times in the 2ha seed line compared to wt but significantly more  were up-regulated. most of them are embryo and nodule specific genes as well as some transposon-like genes. there were no large scale changes observed in the karyotype. the methylation profiling revealed some differences in dna methylation between 2ha and wt. furthermore, hypermethylation of the mteil <dig> gene is associated with increased abundance of a small antisense rna which targets the 3’- utr region and likely acts to posttranscriptionally silence mteil <dig> expression. mteil <dig> down-regulation impacts on nodulation, root growth, root branching and other phenotypes, consistent with weak ethylene insensitivity. as signalling through mteil <dig> is questionable it could occur through the closely related mteil <dig> whose expression is not down-regulated. these observations are consistent with the origin of 2ha by selection from a regenerated plant that had passed through a cycle of tissue culture  <cit>  suggesting that the epigenetic changes in culture can be fixed in regenerated plants. finally, segregation analysis indicates that the eil <dig> trait and se are not directly linked.
