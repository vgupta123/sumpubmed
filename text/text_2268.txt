BACKGROUND
plants as sessile organisms have formed a variety of defence mechanisms to protect themselves from persistently changing stress factors, such as extreme temperature, salt and drought  <cit> . temperature, especially high temperature, can affect crop growth and development, severely reducing the yield and quality . under heat stress , the plant cells rapidly respond to a high temperature by inducing the expression of genes encoding heat shock proteins , which are involved in preventing heat-related damage and confer plant thermotolerance  <cit> . many hsps function as molecular chaperones in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, consequently maintaining protein homeostasis in cells and causing the plant’s acquired thermotolerance .

heat shock factors  regulate the expression of hsps by recognizing heat shock elements  within the promoters of hsps  <cit> . hses are characterised by multiple inverted repeats of the ngaan sequence, and at least three hse motifs are required for efficient hsf oligomer binding in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . under non-stress conditions, hsfs are maintained in inactive states and form cytoplasmic complexes with hsp90/hsp <dig> chaperone complexes  <cit> . under hs conditions, as the result of a cytosolic protein response, hsfs are released from chaperone complexes and bind to the hses of target genes after undergoing phosphorylation, sumoylation, trimerisation and nuclear import  <cit> .

hsf families share a conserved modular structure. despite considerable variability in size and sequence, their structures and functions are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom  <cit> . in plant hsfs, the highly conserved dna-binding domain , which is composed of an antiparallel four-stranded β-sheet  and three helical bundles  in the n-terminus is required for the positioning and recognition of hses . the oligimerisation domain , responsible for the transcription factor activity, is connected to the dbd by a flexible linker  <cit>  and is composed of a heptad pattern of hydrophobic amino acid residues . in addition, a cluster of basic amino acid residues, the nuclear localisation signal , essential for nuclear import, a leucine-rich nuclear export signal  for nuclear export, short peptide motifs  for activator functions, and a repressor domain , characterised by the tetrapeptide lfgv in the c-terminus, exist in some hsfs .

the number of hsf genes varies greatly among different eukaryotic organisms. drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans and saccharomyces cerevisiae have a single hsf gene, and vertebrate genomes contain four hsf genes  <cit> . in contrast to the low numbers of hsf genes in animals and yeasts, plants possess large hsf families, with  <dig> hsf genes in arabidopsis ,  <dig> in rice ,  <dig> in maize ,  <dig> hsf genes in soybean , and at least  <dig> in tomato   <cit> , indicating that plant hsfs in various species may have multiple functions in preventing stress damage  <cit> . based on the peculiarities of the hr-a/b regions, plant hsfs are divided into three classes, a, b and c  <cit> . class a and c hsfs contain an extended hr-a/b with  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues between the hr-a and hr-b region, respectively, whereas class b hsfs have a compact hr-a/b region lacking an insertion  <cit> . additionally, class a hsfs contain aromatic , hydrophobic  and acidic  aha activation domains that are absent in class b and c hsfs  <cit> . class b hsfs, except hsfb <dig>  contain the rd in the c-terminus, which is speculated to function as a repressor motif, making hsfb members act as repressors . however, arabidopsis hsfb <dig> is able to positively regulate the acquired thermotolerance  <cit> . this apparent contradiction remains to be elucidated in future research.

many plant hsf genes from various species have been isolated and comprehensively studied. in arabidopsis, hsfa <dig> and hsfa <dig> can synergistically activate target genes by forming superactivator heterodimers  <cit> . while negatively regulating the expression levels of heat-inducible hsfs, hsfb <dig> and hsfb2b are necessary for acquired thermotolerance  <cit> . the expression of hsfa <dig> increases during embryogenesis and seed maturation  <cit> , whereas hsfa <dig> is inactive and inhibits hsfa <dig> activity in tomato  <cit> . hsfa <dig> can enhance the tolerance of plants to multiple abiotic stresses, such as hs  <cit> , salt/osmotic stress  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit>  and anoxia  <cit> . hsfa <dig> in tomato contributes to fruit set during hs by activating the protection mechanisms in the anther  <cit> .

pepper , a very important economic crop, is sensitive to hs; however, investigations regarding the molecular mechanisms of heat tolerance have been limited  <cit> . the hsf gene family has, so far, been fully characterised only in a few model species, such as arabidopsis, rice, maize, wheat and chinese cabbage . the genome sequence of pepper has been published recently  <cit> , which enables the characterisation of the pepper hsf family and their responses to various stresses at the molecular level. in this study, the genome-wide identification of the pepper hsf family members is performed using bioinformatics and gene expression analyses. a total of  <dig> hsf family members from pepper are identified using bioinformatics analysis and pcr tests. the gene structure, conserved domains, chromosomal location, gene duplication and phylogenetic analyses are presented. in addition, we analyze the expression patterns of hsf genes in different pepper tissues, as well as their responses to various stresses. the results provide a foundation for further functional research on hsf genes in pepper and will help to reveal the functions of hsf genes in other plant species.

RESULTS
identification of the hsf gene family in pepper
the hidden markov model  profile of the hsf dbd domain   was used as a blast query against the pepper genome database pgp , and the hsf proteins in arabidopsis, vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa from the ptfd  were also used as blast query against pgp. a total of  <dig> candidate hsf genes were originally obtained from pepper cultivar cm <dig>  aligned with the corresponding genes in the cultivar zunla- <dig> genome, and the different sequences were re-amplified to correct the corresponding pepper hsf genes sequences. one candidate gene  was discarded due to an incomplete dbd domain as identified by pfam, smart  and heatster . as a result,  <dig> hsf candidate genes, whose classification and naming were based on the rules of hsf families from arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> , were identified in pepper . the coding sequence sizes for cahsfs ranged from 606 bp  to  <dig>  bp , deduced proteins from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, respectively, and molecular weights from  <dig>  kda to  <dig>  kda, respectively. the predicted isoelectric points of cahsfs were divergent, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . among the  <dig> pepper hsf genes ,  <dig> members belonged to class a  and seven members belonged to class b , while only one hsf gene was a class c member . in cahsfa, the subclasses of cahsfa <dig> , cahsfa <dig> , cahsfa <dig>  and cahsfa <dig>  were larger than the other subclasses, while subclass cahsfa <dig> had no members.table  <dig> the list of cahsf members identified

identification of conserved domains in pepper hsf proteins
the meme web server  was used to analyze motifs in cahsf proteins . motif  <dig> and  <dig> were found in all  <dig> pepper hsf members, while motif  <dig> was absent in cahsfa <dig> and motif  <dig> was absent in cahsfc <dig>  some motifs only existed in certain members, such as motif  <dig>  which was found in most cahsfa and cahsfc members, but not in cahsfb. generally, the number of motifs in the cahsfbs was less than those in the cahsfas.fig.  <dig> motifs identified by meme tools in pepper hsfs. in total,  <dig> motifs were identified and are indicated by increasing numbers from  <dig> to  <dig>  because motif  <dig> was the same as motif  <dig>  it was labelled as motif  <dig>  different motifs are indicated by different borders and colours. the names of the hsf members from pepper and their combined p-values are on the left side of the figure, and the motif sizes are indicated at the bottom of the figure. the same number in different hsfs refers to the same motif

motif numbers corresponded to the motifs in fig. 1




to better understand the structural characteristics of the cahsf family, the conserved domains were predicted using heatster . six conserved domains, dbd, hr-a/b, nls, aha, rd and nes, were identified in three cahsf classes. as the most conserved domain in the hsfs, dbd  was found in all  <dig> cahsf members . the dbd domain was composed of three helical bundles  and four antiparallel β-sheets , while no α <dig> and intact β <dig> were detected in the dbd domain of cahsfa <dig>  which resulted in its sequence being shorter than those of the other cahsfs. in addition to dbd, hr-a/b, another core conserved domain, was also presented in all cahsf proteins, while the other four conserved domains were only found in specific cahsfs members. for the cahsfas, the nls domain was found in all  <dig> members. cahsfa9a had the longest nls sequence , which covered the dbd and hr-a/b domains, while cahsfa9b, a9c and a9d had the shortest nlss of two amino acids. three and four aha domains, the specific domain that characterizes cahsfas, were identified in cahsfa <dig> and cahsfa <dig>  respectively, while none were found in cahsfa9b. for the cahsfbs, cahsfb <dig> and b <dig> did not contain the nls domain, and similar to cahsfa9a, cahsfb3a also possessed a long nls sequence  covering the dbd and hr-a/b domains. the tetrapeptide motif lfgv, as the core of the rd, was identified in all cahsfb members except cahsfb <dig>  but only cahsfb <dig> contained the nes domain. interestingly, only two domains, dbd and hr-a/b, were identified in cahsfc <dig> table  <dig> functional domains of cahsf members in pepper

phylogenetic and sequence structure analysis in pepper hsf proteins
to discover the phylogenetic relationships among the hsf families, the hsf conserved amino acid sequences   <cit>  of  <dig> proteins from pepper,  <dig> from arabidopsis,  <dig> from tomato ,  <dig> from maize  and  <dig> from rice  were used to generate a phylogenetic tree . based on the phylogenetic tree, class hsfa had the maximum number of subclasses among the three classes, and included five smaller clusters of which four  were closer to class hsfc than the fifth cluster of class hsfa . two hsfa <dig> members from arabidopsis  were not clustered with the hsfa <dig> subclass from other plant species, but were closer to the hsfa <dig> subclass. this was also observed for one member from the maize hsfa <dig> subclass , one member from the maize hsfa <dig> subclass , one member from the rice hsfb <dig> subclass  and cahsfa6c . compared with arabidopsis, maize and rice, tomato hsfs were closer to pepper hsf proteins, which was coincident with the botanical classification.fig.  <dig> neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree of hsf proteins from pepper, tomato, arabidopsis, rice and maize. the n-proximal regions  of hsf proteins were used to construct of the phylogenetic tree with mega  <dig> . for arabidopsis , tomato , rice  and maize  hsf proteins, both locus id and subclass numbers are listed. cahsf proteins are marked in red. an unrooted neighbour-joining analysis was performed with pairwise deletion and poisson correction



a phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of conserved domains  in pepper hsfs was also constructed , which corresponded to the above mentioned motifs distributions  and phylogenetic groups . the exon/intron structure of all  <dig> pepper hsf members was analysed based on their coding sequences and the corresponding genome sequences to obtain further insights into duplication events and evolutionary patterns. cahsfs shared a highly conserved exon/intron structures, with one intron and zero intron phases . there were  <dig> cahsf members with the intron located in the dbd domain, and four members with the intron located between the nls and aha domains, while the introns in cahsfa4a and a4b were located between the aha <dig> and aha <dig> domains. the length of introns varied from 77 bp  to  <dig>  bp .

chromosomal location and hsf gene duplications in the pepper genome
to determine the chromosomal distribution of the cahsf genes, the positions were identified based on their physical positions in the pepper genome database pgp. the  <dig> members mapped to  <dig> out of the  <dig> pepper chromosomes, with no genes mapping to chromosome  <dig> . the number of cahsf genes on each chromosome varied greatly. the largest number of cahsf genes  was located on chromosome  <dig>  four genes were identified on chromosome  <dig>  three genes on chromosome  <dig>  and two genes each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  there was only one cahsf gene each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the plant genome duplication database  analysis confirmed that two pairs of the pepper hsfs  were segmental duplicated sequences , and each of the two pairs were located on different chromosomes . the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  for the two duplicated pairs were less than  <dig> , which suggested that the pairs had evolved mainly under the influence of purifying selection and that the duplication events occurred  <dig>   and  <dig>  million years ago   <cit> .

protein–protein interaction network among cahsf members
to provide further biological information on cahsf members, their protein–protein interaction network of cahsfs was predicated based on the interolog from the arabidopsis interactome. every cahsf member, except cahsfa <dig>  generated a complex interaction network . the arabidopsis homolog of cahsfa <dig>  was not found among the arabidopsis hsf interaction partners. among the cahsfa members, a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  interacted with most other cahsfs, and the three cahsfa <dig> members  also interacted with each other. however, cahsfb <dig> , b3a  and b3b  owned the simple interaction network compared with class cahsfa and other class cahsfb members, and they did not interact with cahsfa <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> members. in general, the class cahsfa members had more interaction partners than class cahsfb and cahsfc members.

expression analysis of cahsf genes at different developmental stages in various organs
to investigate the potential functions of cahsf genes during pepper development, a heat map of the global transcription patterns of the cahsf family in cm <dig> was generated for the pepper genes against rna-seq data of five tissues  and seven developmental stages of pericarp and placenta . the expression pattern of each cahsf gene was significantly different in different tissues and stages. among class cahsfa, cahsfa <dig>  a6a and a9a were constitutively expressed at relatively high levels, while cahsfa4c, a6b, a9b and a9c were expressed at low levels or undetectable in all tested tissues, and the remained class cahsfa genes were expressed highly in some specific tissues. for example, the expression levels of cahsfa4b in root, pl-6dpa  and -16dpa were higher than those in other tissues, but undetectable in pl-b <dig> . although constitutively expressed, cahsfa <dig>  a6a and a9a were transcribed with higher levels in reproductive organs .fig.  <dig> tissue-specific expression analysis of pepper hsf genes. raw data were from rna-seq data of each tissue from cm <dig>  the analysed tissues including root, stem, leaf, pericarp  and placenta  at  <dig>   <dig>  25 days post-anthesis , pc and pl at mature green  and at breaker  stages, pc and pl at  <dig> and 10 days post-breaker . the data from  <dig> pepper hsf genes  were used to create a heat map using hemi. the rna-seq data for zero is indicated as white, and the other data were normalized using log2



cahsfb <dig> was also constitutively expressed in all tested tissues at relatively high abundances, especially in pl . in comparison, the expression level of cahsfb2b was at its lowest levels in pc-b  and -b <dig>  and undetectable in other tissues. cahsfb3a was expressed at a higher level in pl-16dpa than in other organs and other pl developmental stages. in vegetative and reproductive organs, the highest levels of cahsfc <dig> were observed in leaf and pl-b <dig>  respectively, and the lowest level was found in pl-b.

expression analysis of cahsf genes under hs treatment
to examine the heat response profile for cahsfs in pepper, we analysed the transcription levels of cahsf members in the leaves of thermosensitive line b <dig> and thermotolerant line r <dig> under hs condition   <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  in the heat-stressed r <dig> leaves,  <dig> cahsf genes  were up-regulated  by hs, and two members, cahsfb3a and b3b, were down-regulated , while only cahsfc <dig> did not show a marked change. among the up-regulated members, the expression levels of cahsfa <dig>  a <dig>  a6c, b <dig> and b <dig> were higher than other members under hs, and the greatest increase in expression  was found in cahsfa <dig>  followed by cahsfa <dig> . compared with other groups, a <dig> members  were not the predominantly expressed cahsf genes. the transcription levels of the two pairs of duplicated cahsf genes  did not exhibit significant divergences in regulated expression under hs. for the thermosensitive line b <dig>  only  <dig> genes  were up-regulated and  <dig> genes  maintained a stable expression level under hs conditions, which was more than in r <dig>  cahsfa1d, a <dig> and a <dig> were strongly induced in treated b <dig> leaves, and cahsfa <dig> and a <dig> showed particularly strong responses to hs in both thermosensitive line b <dig> and thermotolerant line r <dig> .fig.  <dig> relative gene expression levels of cahsfs, analysed by qrt-pcr, in response to hs treatment in b <dig> and r <dig> leaves. hs treatment: 40 °c for 2 h; b6: pepper thermosensitive line; r9: pepper thermotolerant line. qrt-pcr data were normalized using the pepper ubiquitin-conjugating protein gene  and are shown relative to 0 h. the relative expression levels were calculated using the -ΔΔct method and then a heat map with hemi was created



expression profiles of cahsf genes in response to salt and osmotic stress
although it was well known that hsfs are involved in plant heat acclimatisation, other adverse factors, like salt and osmotic stresses, also affected plant growth and development, so we wondered whether responses to these stresses involved cahsfs. transcription profiles were obtained for cahsf genes in r <dig> roots and stems subjected to 300 mm nacl  for 6 h, and  <dig> % mannitol  for 6 h, respectively.

under the salt stress treatment, six members  were up-regulated in roots and stems, while cahsfa <dig>  a6c and b <dig> were down-regulated in both tissues . the expression levels of five genes, cahsfa1d, a4b, a <dig>  b2b and b3a, were unregulated in roots and stems, while the expression levels of the remaining  <dig> members only showed obvious changes in either roots or stems. for instance, cahsfa1e, a4c and b <dig> were induced by salt stress in roots, but not in stems; however, cahsfa4a, a <dig>  a6b and b <dig> exhibited high expression levels only in stems. interestingly, in the subclass of cahsfa <dig>  cahsfa9d was strongly induced  by salt stress in roots, while cahsfa9a from stems seemed to be more sensitive to salt stress .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of relative cahsfs transcript levels in r <dig> plants exposed to various abiotic stresses. qrt-pcr data of hs as seen in fig.  <dig>  r9: pepper thermotolerant line; l-hs: heat stress ; r-nacl and s-nacl: salt stress  responsiveness of cahsf genes in roots and stems, respectively; r-mannitol and s-mannitol: osmotic stress  responsiveness of cahsf genes in roots and stems, respectively. the expression levels under salt and osmotic stress treatments were relative to that of the samples treated with water. l-cacl <dig>  −put, −aba and -meja: cacl <dig> , putrescine , abscisic acid  and methyl jasmonate  responsiveness of cahsf genes in leaves, respectively. meja was dissolved in  <dig> % ethanol and other substances were dissolved in water; therefore, control seedlings were sprayed with  <dig> % ethanol  or water . the expression levels are relative to that of the control samples



under osmotic stress, nine members  were up-regulated, while four members  were unregulated in stems and roots, and the highest expressing cahsf genes were cahsfa9d  in root and cahsfb3b  in stem. however, no gene was down-regulated in both roots and stems. it is noteworthy that the expression of cahsfa1b, a9a and especially a9d could be induced by both salt and osmotic stresses in both stems and roots.

expression profiles of cahsf genes responses to exogenous aba, meja, putrescine  and cacl2
phytohormones and plant signalling molecules, such as aba, meja, put and ca2+, are involved in various stress signalling pathways  <cit> . to explore the responses of cahsf family genes to these signals, we analysed the expression profiles of cahsf genes in r <dig> leaves treated with these exogenous substances. as shown in fig.  <dig>  after a cacl <dig> treatment,  <dig> cahsf genes were significantly up-regulated, while  <dig> genes were unregulated. similarly,  <dig> cahsf genes were unregulated by a put treatment, and no gene was down-regulated. only five and four of the  <dig> cahsf genes were up-regulated by aba and meja treatment, respectively, whereas seven and nine members were down-regulated, respectively.

cahsfb <dig> expression could be induced by all four signal substances, while cahsfa9a and a9b were up-regulated by cacl <dig>  put and aba, but down-regulated by the meja treatment. in addition, cahsfa6a was induced by cacl <dig> and put, but down-regulated by aba and meja. the genes with the highest induced levels by cacl <dig>  put and meja treatment were cahsfa9d, cahsfa9a and cahsfa1d, respectively; however, the transcriptional levels of cahsfs after the aba treatment were not as high as in other three treatments. the highest expression level of cahsfb <dig> induced by aba increased less than 5-fold compared to the control.

cahsfa <dig> locates to the cellular nucleus
because of its dominant role in thermotolerant cells  <cit>  and significantly up-regulated expression , we characterized cahsfa <dig> in pepper. first, to clarify whether the cahsfa <dig> protein localizes to the nucleus, we investigated the cellular localization of cahsfa <dig> protein in a transient expression assay by introducing the 35s::cahsfa2-gfp  translational fusion into onion epidermal cells using particle bombardment. the fluorescence of cells transformed with the control 35s::gfp  was distributed throughout the cell, including the nucleus, cytoplasm and cytomembrane. in contrast, the fluorescence of the 35s::cahsfa2-gfp chimera was associated with the cellular nucleus in onion epidermal cells, suggesting a nuclear localization of cahsfa <dig> .fig.  <dig> transient expression of the cahsfa2-gfp fusion protein in onion epidermal cells.  schematic diagram of the construction of the recombinant cahsfa2-gfp vector. 35s: a constitutive promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus; gfp: green fluorescent protein; nos: nopaline synthase terminator.  transient expression of gfp and cahsfa2-gfp in onion epidermal cells.  onion epidermal cells transformed with 35s::gfp as control.  onion epidermal cells transiently expressing 35s::cahsfa2-gfp.  merged images.  dark field images.  bright field images. bars =  <dig>  mm



cahsfa <dig> shows transcriptional activity
the transcriptional activity of the cahsfa <dig> protein was examined using a yeast expression system. the fusion plasmids pgbkt7-cahsfa <dig> and pgbkt <dig>  were transformed into yeast strain ah <dig>  and grown on sd medium lacking tryptophan  or lacking tryptophan, histidine and adenine . the growth status of transformants was evaluated . yeast cells containing either pgbkt <dig> or pgbkt7-cahsfa <dig> could grow well on sd/trp- plates; however, only cells containing pgbkt7-cahsfa <dig> could grow on sd/trp-ade-his- plates and turn blue in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-α-d-galacto-pyranoside , which showed that lacz, the second reporter gene, was activated by cahsfa <dig>  the above results demonstrated the presence of transcriptional activity in the cahsfa <dig> protein.fig.  <dig> transactivational activity of the cahsfa <dig> protein in yeast.  schematic diagram illustrating the cahsfa <dig> cdna fragments encoding cahsfa <dig> that was fused to the dna sequences encoding the gal <dig> dna binding domain in the yeast vector pgbkt <dig>   transactivational analysis of cahsfa <dig> in yeast. fusion proteins of pgbkt7-cahsfa <dig> and pgbkt <dig> were expressed in yeast strain ah <dig>  the transformants were streaked on the sd/trp- and sd/trp-ade-his-  medium. the plates were incubated at 30 °c for  <dig> d



cahsfa <dig> discriminatively responds to hs in two pepper lines differing in thermotolerance
to further determine the response of cahsfa <dig> to hs, we analysed the expression of this gene under hs and during recovery at room temperature in thermosensitive line b <dig> and thermotolerant line r <dig> . during hs, although the cahsfa <dig> level was induced after  <dig>  h at 40 °c  in b <dig> and r <dig>  the expression level in r <dig> leaves was maintained at a higher level  compared with control to the end of the hs treatment  . after the heat-treated seedlings were moved back to normal temperature conditions for the 48 h recovery treatment, the cahsfa <dig> expression level remained at high after a short recovery time  in r <dig>  while it was down-regulated after a long recovery time  in both b <dig> and r <dig> leaves . it is worth noting that the cahsfa <dig> expression level in r <dig> leaves under hs conditions for 4 h  was lower than after a 1 h hs treatment, and the level was slightly down-regulated at the end of the hs treatment  in b <dig> fig.  <dig> expression level of cahsfa <dig> in pepper in responses to hs treatment. b6: pepper thermosensitive line; r9: pepper thermotolerant line.  the time course of hs treatments. triangles indicate the time points when the leaves were collected .  expression profiles of cahsfa <dig> in pepper leaves under the hs treatment at different time points. expression data were normalized with ubi- <dig> as the reference gene. the expression levels are relative to that of the sample a from b <dig> and r <dig>  respectively



discussion
more and more evidence suggests that hsfs play central roles in plant developmental and defence processes  <cit> . benefiting from genome availability, the functions of the hsf family genes have been characterized in many plants, including the model plants arabidopsis  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , as well as other plants, including grass  <cit> , chinese cabbage  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . however, with the limited investigations into the molecular basis of heat tolerance, little is known about the hsf family in pepper.

in the present study,  <dig> hsf genes in the nutritionally and economically important pepper were identified based on the pepper genome   <cit> . although the total number of hsf genes was similar to that of arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> , the members of some specific hsf subclasses in pepper were different from other two species. for example, the number of subclass hsfa <dig> members in pepper was less, but the number in subclass hsfa <dig> was more, than in tomato, while no pepper hsf members were classified into subclass hsfa <dig>  which suggested the possibility of a gene loss event during the evolutionary process  <cit> . another interesting observation was the surprising enlargement of the subclass cahsfa <dig> with four members in pepper, compared with only one member in tomato. usually a single hsfa <dig> gene is found in eudicots, including arabidopsis and tomato, whereas soybean contained two members and eucalyptos grandis  contained at least  <dig> closely related hsfa9-encoding genes  <cit> . the reasons for the expansion of the cahsfa <dig> genes remain to be elucidated by further investigations.

the dbd domain of about  <dig> amino acid residues is highly conserved in yeast, mammals and plants  <cit> ; however, it is noteworthy that the dbd of cahsfa <dig> in pepper, having only  <dig> amino acid residues, was shorter than the other cahsfs, lacked the full α1-helix and had a truncated β1-sheet. however, the central helix-turn-helix motif  required for specific interactions with hses, and the w amino acid residue in the incomplete β1-sheet required for aromatic-aromatic interactions  <cit> , were still intact in the dbd domain of cahsfa <dig>  which might allow the protein to exert basic functions, but the effects of the truncated dbd in cahsfa <dig> need to be determined. it was interesting that aha, the essential domain for activator function in the hsfa class  <cit> , did not occur in cahsfa9b and a9d . these hsfs that lacked aha domains could play their roles using a characteristic pattern of tryptophan residues by providing additive contributions to the activator function or by binding to other hsfas to form hetero-oligomers  <cit> .

the phylogenetic analysis revealed that pepper hsf members were more closely related to those from tomato than to those from arabidopsis, maize and rice , which was consistent with the fact that both pepper and tomato were members of the solanaceae family  <cit> . in the hsfa <dig> subclass, four cahsfa <dig> members  and three tomato members  clustered in the branch of the hsfa <dig> group. only one hsfa <dig> member from tomato was confirmed, while the other two members, sl02g <dig> and sl11g <dig>  were identified to be hsf-like  genes, hsfl <dig> and hsfl <dig>  respectively  <cit> . no hsf members from eudicot species  clustered in the hsfc <dig> branch, because gene duplications in the monocots lineage led to subclass hsfc <dig> being unique in monocot species  <cit> , which was the most marked difference between monocots and eudicots. conversely, hsfa <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  which emerged presumably after the split of monocots and eudicots  <cit> , were not found in monocot plants . the structural analyses showed that all of the cahsf genes contained only one intron , which was presumed to be a conservative evolutionary pattern, while the diverse length of the inserted introns might influence the functionally divergences of the cahsf genes.

the cahsf genes were distributed on  <dig> out of  <dig> chromosomes, except chromosome  <dig>  similarly, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in tomato lacked hsf genes, suggesting that the hsf genes might distribute widely in the genome of the common ancestor of these members of the solanaceae family. gene duplication is a major evolutionary mechanism in genomes that helped plants adapt to various environmental stresses  <cit> . two pairs of paralogs  were detected in the pepper hsf family, which was less than the number in rice   <cit> , maize   <cit> , and apple   <cit> . neither pair was involved in the regional duplications within the same chromosome. the two members of each pair originated from segmental duplications between chromosomes, which occurred at  <dig>   and  <dig>  million years ago . because most plants with diploidized polyploids retained numerous duplicated chromosomal blocks within their genomes, segmental duplication occurred more frequently than the other two principal evolutionary patterns  in plants  <cit> . based on the vital role of segmental duplications in the family evolution, which occurred frequently in slowly evolving gene families  <cit> , we proposed that the pepper hsf gene family might have a slow evolutionary rate, as in maize  <cit> .

the life activities in plants are attributable to protein–protein interactions. the construction of protein–protein interaction networks would provide necessary information on the mechanisms of life activities and on exploring the biological functions of unknown proteins. based on the interolog from arabidopsis, the protein–protein interaction network among the cahsfs was constructed . the number of cahsfa interaction partners was the greatest among the three cahsf classes, which might indicate that cahsfas have a unique role as the master regulators of thermotolerance, and were essential for plants survival under serious hs conditions  <cit> . in the complex network, cahsfa1s  interacted with cahsfa <dig> and these proteins might act synergistically to form a super-activator complex, which strongly regulates downstream hs-related genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . despite not participating in the complicated interaction network, the arabidopsis homolog of cahsfa <dig>  specifically interacted and suppressed the anti-apoptotic factor athsfa <dig>  <cit> , which acted as a pro-apoptotic factor. cahsfa <dig> might have a similar function in pepper, although such a role needs to be confirmed.

gene expression patterns are usually closely related to their functions  <cit> . in this study, the expression profiles of each cahsf gene in five different tissues were investigated. cahsfa <dig>  a6a, a9a and b <dig> were found to be constitutively expressed at relatively high levels in the various tissues and at multiple developmental stages under normal conditions . a similar situation was found in other plants, like arabidopsis   <cit> , apple   <cit> , wheat   <cit> . the tissue- and stage-specific expression patterns of pepper cahsf family genes, such as cahsfa1b in root, cahsfb3a in pl-16dpa, cahsfb <dig> in pc-b <dig>  and cahsfc <dig> in leaf and pl-b <dig>  indicated that cahsfs might be widely involved in the development of various organs and tissues, which is helpful to further understanding the functions of cahsf genes in pepper developmental biology  <cit> .

most of the cahsf genes were up-regulated under hs conditions. cahsfa1d, a <dig>  a <dig>  a6c, b <dig> and b <dig> were the main members with significantly higher expression levels during hs in b <dig> and r <dig> leaves , which suggested that these cahsfs were major transcription factors of heat-induced hsp genes under hs conditions  <cit> . in tomato, the close relative of pepper, hsfa1a acted as master regulator for triggering the heat response and acquired thermotolerance, and could not be replaced by other hsfs  <cit> . among cahsfa members in thermotolerant line r <dig>  the expression levels of three members of subclass cahsfa <dig>  were not striking, compared with a <dig>  a <dig> or a6c, and, similarly, no master regulator was found among the four members of hsfa <dig> from arabidopsis yet  <cit> . these results indicated that there were species-specific features in the functions of hsf members in regulating genes involved in plant hs responses. the number of up-regulated cahsfa in r <dig>  under hs conditions was greater than in the thermosensitive line b <dig> , and the expression levels of major transcription factors  in r <dig> were higher than their corresponding levels in b <dig>  although the cahsfa1d expression level in b <dig> was much higher than in r <dig>  these highly expressed cahsfas might co-regulate the downstream hs-related genes, thus enhancing the pepper’s thermotolerance.

notably, five out of seven members of class cahsfb, especially b <dig> and b <dig>  were significantly up-regulated by hs in r <dig> leaves, which was in accord with the hsfb <dig> and b <dig> groups in wheat  <cit> . most hsfbs, except hsfb <dig>  contain the tetrapeptide lfgv in the c-terminal domain, which is assumed to function as a repressor motif in the transcriptional machinery  <cit> . the expression patterns of most cahsfb members under hs could be explained by a report in tomato. this work indicated that hs-induced hsfb <dig> could act as a coativator, cooperating with hsfa1a by forming a ternary complex with histone acetyl transferase hac <dig> to synergistically activate a reporter gene  <cit>  or interacted with hsfa1a or a <dig> to regulate the different stages of hs response  <cit> . however, the roles of these up-regulated cahsfb members during hs still needs further investigations. both cahsfb3a and b3b were down-regulated in b <dig> and r <dig> leaves under hs conditions, which suggested that the paralogs might act as repressors among cahsf members. the expression level of cahsfc <dig> did not present marked changes under hs in the thermotolerant line r <dig>  which was similar to zmhsf- <dig> from the maize hsfc class  <cit> , while the down-regulated expression pattern of cahsfc <dig> in the thermosensitive line b <dig> under hs was similar to those of c <dig> group members from wheat  <cit> . the contradictory observation might be attributed to the species- and lines-specific responses to hs in hsfc, but testing this hypothesis requires further research.

in addition to hs, cahsf genes were also regulated by salt and osmotic stresses . cahsfa1b, a9a and a9d could be induced by hs, salt or osmotic stresses, while cahsfa6c and b <dig> were inhibited by salt stress but enhanced by hs. the expression of cahsfb3a and b3b increased under osmotic stress but decreased under hs, which indicated that this pair of paralogs might have a specific regulatory role in strengthening a plant’s adaptability to stresses other than hs  <cit> . interestingly, the expression pattern of cahsfa <dig> was different under salt stress, hs and even in roots and stems from r <dig> under osmotic stress; however, the overexpression of athsfa <dig> conferred not only thermotolerance, but also salt and osmotic stress tolerance  <cit> , which implied that cahsfs might play different roles in various tissues under different abiotic stresses and that some cahsfs might participate in shared roles among various stresses  <cit> .

the signaling substances ca2+, put, aba and meja are involved in many signal transduction pathways under various stress conditions, and regulated cahsfs expression. different signals regulated different cahsfs. for instance, both ca2+ and put could up-regulate cahsfa6a, a9a and a9d, while aba and meja down-regulated cahsfa6a, which indicated that although most cahsfs were highly conserved, they might play their roles via different signal transduction pathways. ca2+, as the second messenger, couples extracellular signals with intracellular physiological and biochemical reactions to regulate the process of signal transduction in plant cells under abiotic stress. in arabidopsis, calmodulin atcam <dig> was required in hs signalling to activate calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase , and the latter could phosphorylate hsfa1a  <cit> . thus, it was inferred that the induction of cahsfa6a, a9a and a9d by ca2+ might be attributed to cam <dig> in pepper through the calcium-signalling pathway. put can enhance a plant’s tolerance to abiotic stresses by regulating cell ph, balancing reactive oxygen metabolism and stabilizing membrane structures  <cit> , but there were few reports about the function of put on the regulation of hsfs. in this study, put induced the expression of cahsfa <dig>  a <dig>  a6a, a9a, a9d and b <dig>  which could explain our previous observation that put was involved in the hs process  <cit> . aba  and meja  <cit>  have been reported to participate in the protection against heat damage. cahsfa6a was down-regulated by aba but up-regulated by ca2+ and put, which suggested that cahsfa6a played different roles in the physiological processes mediated by aba and the ca2+ or put pathways. although the promoters of cahsfa1b, a4a and a4b contained the cgtca- or tgacg-motifs  , meja could barely influence the expression of these genes, which might result from the joint effects of other cis-elements and complex regulatory mechanisms.

hsfa <dig>  as the hs-induced enhancer of thermotolerance  <cit> , has been researched in many species  <cit> ; however, only limited characteristics of hsfa <dig> in pepper have previously been described  <cit> . in this study, we found that cahsfa <dig> possessed the typical features of the hsf family, including being located in the nucleus by its nls domain , having transcriptional activity , and responding to continuous hs , which confirmed our genome-wide identification of the cahsf genes. among the  <dig> pepper hsfs, the induced expression of cahsfa <dig> in response to hs was only less than cahsfa <dig> in r <dig> or cahsfa1d in b <dig> , which suggested that cahsfa <dig> might become a dominant hsf, as seen with hsfa <dig> from arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . the lower cahsfa <dig> expression level in the thermosensitive line b <dig> than in the thermotolerant line r <dig>  induced under hs might be the reason for the differing thermotolerance levels in the two pepper lines. however, the cahsfa <dig> level in r <dig> after 4 h of hs was lower than after 1 h, and the level was slightly down-regulated at the end of hs treatment in b <dig>  the different expression pattern might be attributed to regulatory genes or the circadian clock. under long-term hs conditions, when hsp17-ii were maintained at a high level, they directly interacted with hsfa <dig>  forming inactive complexes  <cit> . once the molecular chaperones were lacking, hsfa <dig> would be released from the complexes to act as a transcription factors. in addition, hsfb2b was induced after hs and repressed hsfa <dig>  however, cahsfa <dig> might be a rhythmic gene, like arabidopsis hsfb2b, which is regulated by both hs and the circadian clock  <cit> , while the regulatory mechanism of cahsfa <dig> responding to hs needs to be explored further.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified a total of  <dig> cahsfs in the pepper genome. based on the bioinformatics analysis of highly conserved domains, the cahsf genes were divided into three classes, class cahsfa, b and c, and distributed in  <dig> out of the  <dig> chromosomes, with none found on chromosome  <dig>  according to the rna-seq data from pepper cm <dig>  the cahsf members were expressed in at least one tissue among root, stem, leaf, pericarp and placenta. results of quantitative real-time pcr demonstrated that the cahsfs responded to hs , except cahsfc <dig> in thermotolerant line r <dig> leaves, while thermosensitive line b <dig> showed different response patterns. many cahsfs were also regulated by salt and osmotic stress, as well as the signal substances ca2+, put, aba and meja. further more, cahsfa <dig> had the typical characteristics of hsfs, including being located to the nucleus, having transcriptional activity and responding to continuous hs. our research not only added a new member to the plant hsf family, but also provided information that could be used in further functional analyses of cahsfs under various abiotic stresses and in elucidating signal transduction pathways in pepper.
