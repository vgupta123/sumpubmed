BACKGROUND
cancer has become one of the most serious threats to human health. cancer is driven in part by somatic mutations, including single nucleotide substitutions, small indels, large copy number aberrations, and structural aberrations that accumulate during the lifetime of an individual  <cit> . at the same time, a large number of somatic mutations have been discovered in cancer genomes  <cit> . one key challenge in interpreting these data is to distinguish functional driver mutations, which lead to tumorigenesis, from passenger mutations, which are functionally neutral and have no consequence for cancer  <cit> . the second key challenge is to detect biological driver pathways, which are frequently perturbed within some tumor cells, and cause the product of tumorigenic properties, such as cell angiogenesis, metastasis or proliferation.

the final decision of whether a gene mutation is a driver or a passenger is to be made after testing its biological function. however, it is expensive at present to detect somatic mutations and to validate their functions experimentally  <cit> . a common approach to detect driver mutations is to detect genes with recurrent mutations in a large number of cancer patients. the standard technology to detect recurrently mutated genes is to test a single gene whether its frequency of mutations is significantly higher than expected  <cit> . this statistical approach has been used to detect many important cancer genes, but it can't be used to identify driver mutation pathways and driver genes in cancer.

it is an urgent priority to predict driver mutated genes and pathways through computational approaches. a large number of computational methods have been developed to address these challenges. there are mainly two computational approaches: one approach is to infer driver mutated genes and pathways by integrating somatic mutation data and additional biological knowledge such as protein-protein interaction networks, gene expression data or other sources of information  <cit> , and the other is to directly find driver pathways or groups of driver genes de novo from somatic mutation data utilizing two combinatorial properties, namely - coverage and exclusivity  <cit> , rather than integrate any additional biological information and prior knowledge. these methods are successful in inferring the influence of some mutations, but generally do not result in overlapping driver pathways. actually some genes may be involved in multiple biological processes, so these genes may be members of more than one driver pathway.

in recent years, the declining costs of genome sequencing allow measurement of the somatic mutations in many cancer genomes. many research results, including those from the cancer genome atlas  website , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  and other projects, report a large number of significantly mutated genes. the analysis shows that driver mutations vary greatly between cancer patients, even for the same type of cancer  <cit> . one of the biological explanations for the mutated heterogeneity is that driver mutations not only target individual genes, but also target groups of genes in cellular regulatory and signaling pathways. therefore, different cancer patients may hold different mutated gene members from a pathway of cancer development. some methods have been introduced to look for enrichment in genes or groups of genes by prior biological knowledge, such as functional groups from go  <cit>  or known pathways from kegg  <cit> . more recently, other methods have also been developed to detect recurrently mutated sub-networks by integrating somatic mutations and protein interaction networks.

the known gene and protein interaction networks in humans remain incomplete, and the information about the interactions in these networks is unreliable and imprecise  <cit> . the goal of identifying driver pathways is to reveal the natural data mutation properties and to gain some initial insights regarding mutated genes and pathways. therefore, a good algorithm for finding mutated driver pathways should depend as little as possible on prior knowledge, which is usually not available before results analysis. recently, the de novo driver exclusivity   <cit>  and multi-dendrix  <cit>  algorithms have been introduced to detect driver pathways using combinatorial constraints derived from biological knowledge of how driver mutations emerge in pathways. particularly, each cancer patient contains relatively few driver mutations, and these mutations perturb multiple cellular signaling or regulatory pathways. each driver pathway contains approximately one driver mutation for one patient, so this is a pattern of mutual exclusivity between mutation genes in the driver pathway. moreover, an important driver pathway should cover a large number of patients, so this is a pattern of high coverage by mutations. that is, a driver pathway corresponds to a set of genes that is mutated in a large number of patients, and whose mutations are mutually or approximately exclusive. these driver pathways of high coverage and mutually exclusivity are generally smaller and more focused than most signaling and regulatory pathways. the multi-dendrix algorithm  <cit>  improves on dendrix algorithm  <cit>  in finding sets of genes with mutual exclusivity and high coverage. dendrix calculates a single score for the weight of a set of genes, and finds the highest scoring set, then removes the set of genes found in previous iteration, and then repeats the step. hence, the algorithm can discover multiple driver pathways iteratively. however, such an iterative approach can only yield local optimal sets of genes. multi-dendrix algorithm can identify multiple cancer driver pathways simultaneously by the multiple maximum weight sub-matrix problem using integer linear program  <cit> .

to reduce the complexity of the solution and solve the np-hard problem of the maximum weight sub-matrix in an efficient approach, we present a new nbm algorithm to detect functional driver pathways de novo from somatic mutation data without any prior biological knowledge. in the first step, we filter the mutation matrix and reserve the genes which meet a certain frequency of recurrence, as genes altered in only one or few cancer patients may not be driver genes but passenger genes. so we remove the genes whose mutation numbers are lower than  <dig> percent of all cancer patients. in the second step, we construct a gene network by calculating the exclusive score between each pair of genes. if the exclusive score between a pair of genes is greater than or equal to a threshold λ, the edge between the pair will be created, and its weight is the exclusive score. in the third step, we present a novel greedy growth process based on the concept of high coverage and high exclusivity to find gene sets in the gene network constructed in the previous step. these gene sets are likely to correspond to driver pathways.

methods
exclusivity and coverage
two important characteristics on the expected modes of somatic mutations have been used to understand the somatic mutation process of cancer in the last couple of years. vandin et al.  <cit>  introduced a measure to discover mutated driver pathways with two criteria from biological knowledge. the first one is "high coverage" which means many patients have at least one mutation in the pathway  <cit> ; the second one is "high exclusivity" which means most patients have no more than one mutation in the pathway  <cit> . given a binary mutation matrix a with m rows  and n columns , the exclusive degree function ed and coverage degree function cd are defined as follows. for a gene g, the coverage Γ = {i: aig - 1} represents the set of patients in which gene g is mutated . similarly, for a sub-matrix m of size m × k in the mutation matrix a, the coverage is Γ = ∪g∈m Γ. m is mutually exclusive if Γ ∩ Γ = ∅, for all gj, gk, ∈ m, gj ≠ gk,  <dig> ≤ j, k ≤ n a gene set in a named as a driver pathway is a column sub-matrix of a with high coverage and high exclusivity.

for a sub-matrix m of size m × k, the exclusive degree function ed is defined as:

  ed=|Γ|∑g∈m|Γ|. 

obviously, for a pair of genes gj, gk, the exclusive degree of them is defined as:

  ed=|Γ⋃Γgk||Γ|+Γgk. 

according to the above analysis, ed =  <dig> when m is mutually exclusive.

for a sub-matrix m of size m × k, the coverage degree function cd is defined as:

  cdm=Γmm. 

obviously, for a pair of genes gj, gk, the coverage degree of them is defined as:

  cd=|Γ⋃Γ|m. 

note that cd =  <dig> when m is the complete coverage.

the optimal results for a sub-matrix m are ed =  <dig> and cd =  <dig>  but it is practically impossible. obviously, we want to get the optimal results for the exclusive degree and the coverage degree at the same time, but increasing coverage may be obtained at the expense of decreasing exclusivity. so we define a function named exclusivity-coverage-degree as follows:

  ecd=ed×cd=|Γ|2m×∑g∈m|Γ|. 

obviously, for a pair of genes gj, gk, the exclusivity-coverage-degree is defined as:

  ecd=ed×cd=|Γ⋃Γ|2m×|+Γ). 

note that ecd =  <dig> when m is the mutually exclusive and complete coverage. we need to find a gene set m whose exclusive degree and coverage degree are large simultaneously, so we define a function ecd which allows for a tradeoff between exclusivity and coverage.

constructing a gene network based on approximate exclusivity
vandin et al. introduced the maximum weight sub-matrix problem, which is defined for an integer k >  <dig> as the problem of looking for a m × k sub-matrix m of a that maximizes a weight w  <cit> , and showed that this problem is an np-hard problem. to solve it more efficiently, we construct a weighted gene network based on approximate exclusivity between each pair of genes to simplify the relationships among genes and to reduce the calculation complexity greatly. first, we calculate the exclusive degree of each pair of genes in a somatic mutation matrix using formula . second, we construct a gene network in which each node represents a gene and the weight of an edge represents the exclusive degree between the pair of genes that is greater than or equal to a threshold λ. if the exclusive degrees between one gene and the rest of all other genes are less than the threshold λ, the gene will not appear in the network. the process is shown in figure  <dig> 

clustering method in a gene network
our clustering method consists of two steps. in the first step, the algorithm grows gene sets with high coverage and high exclusivity from selected two seeds. initially, it selects two connected nodes with the highest exclusivity-coverage-degree as the first two seeds, and then grows the gene set from them using a greedy procedure. whenever the growth process finishes, the algorithm selects the next two connected seeds by considering all the nodes that have not been included in any of gene sets found so far and taking the two connected seeds with the highest exclusivity-coverage-degree again. the whole procedure terminates when there are no two connected nodes remaining to consider.

a step-by-step description of the greedy growth process beginning from two connected nodes v <dig>  v <dig> is as follows  <cit> .

step 1: let v <dig> = {v <dig>  v1}. set the step number t =  <dig> 

step 2: calculate the exclusive degree and exclusivity-coverage-degree of vt and let vt+ <dig> = vt.

step 3: for every external node v incident on at least one boundary edge, calculate the exclusive degree and exclusivity-coverage-degree of v' = vt ∪ {v}. if ecd >ecd and ed >λ, let vt+ <dig> = v'.

step 4: for every internal node v which belongs to vt, calculate the exclusive degree and exclusivity-coverage-degree of v' = vt\{v}. if ecd >ecd and ed >λ, let vt+ <dig> = v".

step 5: if vt ≠ vt+ <dig>  increase t and return to step  <dig>  otherwise, declare vt a locally optimal driver pathway.

the growth process permits the removal of any node from the gene set being grown, including the original seed nodes. if the original one or two seed nodes are not included in the final driver pathway, they are considered outliers and they will not be included in any of the driver pathways, except in the case when another high exclusivity and high coverage cluster grown from different seed nodes absorbs them.

in the second step, we discard driver pathway candidates that contain less than three genes or those whose coverage degree is below a given threshold δ. for the gene sets whose coverage degree is too low, they are usually not regarded as driver pathways.

parameter settings
in the algorithm, threshold λ is used to decide whether there is an edge between each pair of genes according to its exclusive degree. threshold δ is applied to determine whether a driver pathway candidate is chosen as a driver pathway according to its coverage degree. based on the analysis of the algorithm and a large number of experiments, the following threshold values have been identified as leading to good results λ =  <dig>  and δ =  <dig> .

RESULTS
to assess the efficiency of nbm, we apply the method on simulated data and compare the results with multi-dendrix  <cit> , with the iterative versions of dendrix  <cit>  and the rme methods  <cit> . when running all methods on a conventional computer, the nbm can obtain optimal results in less than nine seconds on a data set containing five pathways. multi-dendrix can obtain the results within a similar time to nbm, while iterative-dendrix and iterative-rme obtain the results in more than  <dig> s. to assess the performance of nbm, we apply it onto five biological datasets . firstly, we remove the genes whose mutation frequency is lower than  <dig> percent of samples. secondly, we construct a weighted gene network based on approximate exclusivity between each pair of genes from somatic mutation data. finally, we obtain driver pathways based on the exclusive degree and exclusivity-coverage-degree using a new greedy strategy.


q
a comparison of the runtimes of iterative-rme, iterative-dendrix, multi-dendrix and nbm on simulated mutation data with different passenger mutation probability q. runtimes of each algorithm are shown as the mean of  <dig> runs for each q. n/a represents that iterative-rme algorithm does not give any result within  <dig> hours. simulations are performed on the machine running 64-bit windows with intel xeon  <dig>  ghz processor and a maximum of  <dig> gb of available memory.

simulated data
we generate mutation data for m =  <dig> patients and n =  <dig> genes as follows. five pathways p =  with each pi containing five genes are implanted in the mutation matrix. we select the coverage Γ uniformly whose coverage degrees cd are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , respectively. for each pathway pi, |Γ| patients are selected at random and a driver mutation is added to exactly one gene from the pathway pi. therefore, in each pathway pi, the driver mutations are mutually exclusive. then passenger mutations are added at random with probability of q.

we compare nbm with multi-dendrix  <cit> , iterative versions of dendrix  <cit>  and rme  <cit>  on the simulated mutation data. we calculate the average runtime of each algorithm on the simulated data. the runtimes of each algorithm are shown in table  <dig> reflecting on different value of q.

biological data
to assess the performance of our nbm method on real biological data, we collect five somatic mutation data sets which are obtained from  <cit>  directly. in table  <dig> we present the information about the data sets, including number of patients, number of genes, maximum mutation frequency for all genes, average mutation number of each sample and average of mutation frequency for all genes.

mmf: maximum mutation frequency for all genes. amn: average mutation number of each sample. amf: average of mutation frequency for all genes. ng: number of genes which are mutated in more than  <dig> samples in the mutation matrix. hnscc: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma data. gbm1: glioblastoma multiforme data  <dig>  gbm2: glioblastoma multiforme data  <dig>  lc: lung carcinoma data. oc: ovarian carcinoma data.

we first apply nbm to the lung adenocarcinoma data set used by vandin et al.  <cit>  to assess its performance compared with multi-dendrix, dendrix and rme. the nbm can obtain the driver pathways in less than  <dig> s, and multi-dendrix can get them in about  <dig> s, while dendrix and rme can get them in more than  <dig> s. the analysis shows that the nbm is more efficient than the three other methods. we find that the four methods obtain either the same results or similar results. for instance, all the four methods can obtain the same gene set . rme, dendrix and multi-dendrix can obtain gene set  with k =  <dig>  and nbm can obtain also the gene set . the exclusive degree and coverage degree of the gene set  are  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, and the exclusive degree and coverage degree of the gene set  are  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. obviously, the exclusive degree of our results is higher than that of the results obtained from the above three methods. it is necessary to acknowledge that the coverage degree declines at the expense of increasing exclusive degree. besides, in our results, egfr and nf <dig> are members of the rtk/ras/pik signaling pathway involved in cellular proliferation, and egfr and nf <dig> are associated with classical and mesenchymal subtypes, respectively. egfr interacts with kras, and nf <dig> inhibits kras in the rtk signaling pathway  <cit> . whereas the pair  is not reported as significant using statistical tests  <cit> . therefore, it is more reasonable for the gene set  to be a driver pathway.

in the following sections, we further apply our method nbm on the five datasets that are presented in table  <dig>  nbm can efficiently obtain the more biologically meaningful results in less time on all five data sets.

CONCLUSIONS
finding mutated driver pathways in cancer is an essential problem in computational biology. in this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called nbm for automatically discovering mutated driver pathways in cancer using somatic mutation data from many cancer patients. our algorithm can find gene sets few mutated together in the same patient  and mutated in many samples . notably, we find these mutation pathways de novo from the somatic mutation data of cancer without any prior biological knowledge of gene expression data, pathways and interactions between genes. in this algorithm, gene network is firstly constructed according to high exclusivity to solve the problem of high complexity encountered in the previous methods. then a new greedy algorithm is introduced to cluster gene sets according to the properties of high exclusivity and high coverage. the results indicate that integrative analyses of somatic mutation data have the potential to detect gene sets pertinent to cancer phenotypes. moreover, the algorithm is also capable of finding the functional relevance of uncharacterized or unexpected genes.

comparing with the previous methods of finding driver mutation pathways, our algorithm is superior in the following two aspects. firstly, the complexity of the solution is reduced by constructing gene networks from somatic mutation data. secondly, there is no need to assign the number of genes in a driver pathway with our algorithm. it is necessary to point out that our algorithm does not use gene interaction data, pathways and other biological information. the algorithm could provide a supplement to the analyses of cancer data and does not replace human analyses. we also anticipate that this method will be increasingly helpful in producing hypotheses that will drive some specific experiments and increase understanding for cancer progression. further development is anticipated with the use of machine learning techniques  <cit> . we also plan to analyze temporal gene mutation data with the use of spiking neural networks using the method suggested in  <cit> .
