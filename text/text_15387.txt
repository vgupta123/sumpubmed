BACKGROUND
recent advances in invertebrate immunology have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the ways in which animals respond to immunological challenges. previously, it was assumed that invertebrate immune response proteins were germ-line encoded and were selected over evolutionary time scales for broad recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns . this was originally based on the assumption that immune diversification only occurred in jawed vertebrates through somatic recombination of the immunoglobulin  gene family that employed recombination activating gene -mediated rearrangements of gene segments. however, recent studies on invertebrates, jawless vertebrates and higher plants have suggested that diversification of immunological responses may occur in all organisms through a variety of mechanisms. lampreys and hagfish monoallelically express somatically diversified variable lymphocyte receptors  that contain different numbers and sequences of leucine rich repeats   <cit> . in shrimp, three classes of penaeidins show significant population diversity and have varying antimicrobial activities against fungi and gram-positive bacteria based on substitutions and deletions within the proline-rich and cysteine-rich regions  <cit> . the down syndrome cell adhesion molecule  gene in drosophila has  <dig> exons which undergo extensive mutually exclusive alternative mrna splicing  <cit> . a dscam homologue has also been identified in the mosquito with  <dig> exons  <cit> . the dscam gene potentially produces ~ <dig>  or ~ <dig>  different transcripts in drosophila or anopheles hemocytes, respectively, that encode a diverse set of proteins putatively involved in phagocytosis  <cit> . in the tunicate, ciona intestinalis, and in amphioxus, branchiostoma floridae, igv-region containing chitin-binding proteins  are encoded by polymorphic gene families and may have gut associated antimicrobial function  <cit> . the freshwater snail, biomphalaria glabrata, has  <dig> families of fibrinogen-related protein  genes that are expressed in response to infection with trematode parasites, and diversify through gene conversion and alternative splicing  <cit> . finally, plant disease resistance  genes encoding proteins with lrr domains, which function in pathogen detection, generate diversity through a variety of mechanisms including meiotic mispairing, gene duplication and gene conversion  <cit> . the immune response of the purple sea urchin, strongylocentrotus purpuratus, is likely mediated, in part, by a number of large gene families  <cit> . these include toll-like receptors , nacht-domain containing nod-like receptors   <cit>  and scavenger receptor cysteine-rich repeat-containing proteins   <cit>  that have undergone expansion and diversification in the genome of this species  <cit> . thus, a wide variety of organisms are able to generate a diverse immune response using a variety of molecular mechanisms  <cit> .

in addition to the large gene families in the s. purpuratus genome mentioned above, a highly variable family of transcripts has been identified called 185/ <dig>  which shows striking increases in response to bacteria and lps  <cit> . optimal alignment of the 185/ <dig> sequences requires the insertion of large gaps that define  <dig> blocks of sequence called elements  <cit> . different subsets of elements are present in the mrnas that are encoded by a single exon and do not result from alternative splicing. elements range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides and show sequence diversity based on single nucleotide polymorphisms  and small insertions/deletions . cdnas that share the same set of elements  have been used to categorize sets of cdnas. based on the nucleotide diversity in each of the elements, sets of cdnas are likely to be composed of members with unique nucleotide sequences. analysis of  <dig> full-length cdnas identified significant variability based on the element pattern and sequence diversity, in addition to the position and number of several different tandem and interspersed repeats  <cit> . message variations were used to define  <dig> different element patterns, and the nucleotide diversity resulted in  <dig> unique mrnas that encoded  <dig> different proteins. one of the  <dig> cdnas had a frame shift that resulted in missense sequence and an early stop codon. the unexpected diversity of the 185/ <dig> mrnas, which are expressed in response to immune challenge, has made them an intriguing gene family for understanding innate immune diversity in an invertebrate.

the 185/ <dig> messages were originally identified from a cdna library constructed from coelomocyte mrna pooled from five sea urchins responding to a large dose of a mixture of whole marine bacteria  <cit> . in the current study, we have simplified this approach by analyzing coelomocyte mrna from individual animals challenged with single pamps – either lipopolysaccharide , β- <dig> -glucan , or double stranded rna  – to identify differences in the 185/ <dig> mrna repertoire in response to different immunological challenges. we report that animals injected with lps and lam express messages with different element patterns before vs. after immune challenge, whereas a similar result was not identified for the dsrna challenge. the sequence diversity of the transcripts decreased in response to lps, suggesting that a specific subset of genes may be expressed in response to this molecular pattern. on the other hand, sequence diversity increased in response to dsrna even though the major element pattern did not change, possibly suggesting that a greater number of genes with the same element pattern are expressed. the diversity of the response suggested that the innate immune system of the purple sea urchin may have evolved to detect and respond efficiently to microbial challenge with an array of 185/ <dig> proteins.

RESULTS
185/ <dig> expression
the outbred sea urchins used in this study were injected with three different pamps and coelomocyte mrna was analyzed for 185/ <dig> expression before challenge and at various times after challenge. messages were amplified by rt-pcr using primers that annealed to the 5' and 3' utrs . sea urchins that did not respond to the initial injection, as measured by expression of sp <dig>  a c-type lectin called spechinoidin  <cit> , received a second injection. in total, nine animals were used in this study and eight were challenged with a single pamp. to compensate for the large variations in the genetic make-up of individual sea urchins  <cit> , which may be reflected in variations in the immune response, animal  <dig> was injected with lps, lam and dsrna, in separate experiments. for clarity, this animal has been identified as 2-lps, 2-lam or 2-dsrna.

185/ <dig> transcript sizes match cdna insert sizes
the range of expressed sizes of the 185/ <dig> messages varied among animals and was influenced by immune challenge . the amplified messages ranged in size from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb, which was generally consistent with previous results  <cit> . amplicons were cloned from nine animals for both pre and post challenge and  <dig> cdnas were fully sequenced. from this set of cdnas,  <dig> different element patterns were identified  of which nine had been reported previously  <cit> . the major band size observed for all animals on rt-pcr gels was approximately  <dig>  kb , which corresponded in size to the major element patterns, e <dig> and e <dig>  through e <dig>  , which were  <dig> nucleotides  in length . a second major band observed on gels was  <dig>  kb , which corresponded in size with four types of element patterns: c <dig> and c <dig>  through c <dig>  , c <dig>  , d <dig> and d <dig>  , and d <dig>  . the largest amplified fragment observed prior to challenge was approximately  <dig>  kb  and corresponded in size with patterns a <dig> and g <dig> . the  <dig>  kb amplicon corresponded with two element patterns, <dig>  and e <dig>  . thus, the observed major band sizes on gels corresponded to the major element patterns determined by sequencing the clones.

patterns  <dig> and  <dig>  isolated from animal 2-dsrna, were much shorter than the other clones from both this study and from previous work  <cit> . pattern  <dig>  only had a 5' utr and element 25b with no other elements . pattern  <dig>  had a 5'utr followed by the leader and elements  <dig> and  <dig>  the remainder of the elements were missing and no stop codon was identified . pattern  <dig> was similar in size to the  <dig>  kb fragment amplified by rt-pcr from animal 2-dsrna . pattern  <dig> had a 5'utr and leader followed by element  <dig> and part of element  <dig> . it was cloned from animal  <dig>  although a fragment of  <dig>  kb was not observed on the gel .

lps challenge
all animals injected with lps  showed similar expression patterns and changes in expression over time . a c-type lectin called sp <dig> was used to assess levels of immune activation  <cit> . it was expressed by animal  <dig> prior to challenge and increased expression by  <dig> hours  after challenge, whereas animal 2-lps and animal  <dig> expressed sp <dig> only after challenge. this indicated that these animals were either immunoquiescent  or down-regulated  at the start of the experiment and that immune challenge with lps activated their immune response. prior to challenge, animal  <dig> expressed 185/ <dig> transcripts ranging in size from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb, and after challenge began to express a predominant  <dig>  kb fragment at  <dig> h that became the only discernable band by  <dig> h. sequence analysis showed that the most common element pattern identified prior to challenge for animal  <dig> was e <dig>  . after injection with lps, 185/ <dig> expression changed such that e <dig>  expression diminished and the predominant element pattern was e <dig> . for a description of mrnas with early stop codons , see early stop codons below.

animal 2-lps expressed three message sizes prior to challenge but by  <dig> h after the first challenge, only two predominant message sizes were observed . the  <dig> h sample from animal 2-lps did not show any 185/ <dig> fragments, although sp <dig> expression was detected . by  <dig> h,  <dig> h after the second challenge, the  <dig>  kb fragment was present. the only pre-challenge element pattern identified from animal 2-lps was c <dig> , which was not found among the post-challenge clones . after injection, an assortment of element patterns was identified from  <dig> clones.

although animal  <dig> expressed four 185/ <dig> sizes both before and after challenge with lps, the major band size changed from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb . the set of clones collected prior to challenge was composed of six distinct element patterns, with the major pattern being c <dig> . seven different element patterns were isolated from animal  <dig> after injection . similar to animal  <dig>  e <dig>  was the predominant pattern expressed post-challenge .

analysis of  <dig> clones isolated from three animals challenged with lps revealed that patterns c <dig>  and e <dig>   represented the majority of transcript types isolated prior to challenge . in contrast, of the  <dig> clones analyzed from the  <dig> h sample, the predominant patterns were e <dig>  or e <dig> . however, among the more rare element patterns , there were differences in the types and numbers of patterns present among the three animals that had received lps.

β- <dig> -glucan challenge
the three animals  injected with β- <dig> -glucan  expressed similarly sized 185/ <dig> messages prior to and after challenge . animal 2-lam did not show expression of either sp <dig> or 185/ <dig> prior to or at  <dig> h after challenge. however, by  <dig> h, sp <dig> transcription was detected in addition to two sizes of 185/ <dig> messages, the most prominent of which was  <dig>  kb. prior to injection, the major element patterns were e <dig>  and e <dig>  . after injection, however, the e <dig> pattern  was the principal pattern identified .

neither 185/ <dig> nor sp <dig> were expressed by animal  <dig> either prior to challenge or at  <dig> h. consequently, a second injection of lam was given  <dig> days  after the initial injection, and gene expression was measured on d  <dig>  a single 185/ <dig> fragment  was observed in addition to sp <dig> expression on d  <dig> . because animal  <dig> did not express detectable 185/ <dig> transcripts prior to injection, the only sample used for sequencing was after the second injection . of the  <dig> clones characterized, seven different patterns were identified  of which the principal element pattern was e <dig> .

animal  <dig> expressed three sizes of 185/ <dig> messages, the predominant being  <dig>  kb, which was present both before and after challenge with lam . lack of sp <dig> expression indicated that the immune response of animal  <dig> was immunoquiescent prior to injection and at  <dig> h, but was activated by  <dig> h. of the  <dig> clones that were sequenced from animal  <dig>  e <dig>  was the most common pattern both before  and after challenge  

in general, animals challenged with lam expressed a  <dig>  kb fragment  <dig> h after injection, which was similar to the response observed for animals challenged with lps. two of the three sea urchins challenged with lam expressed a diverse set of 185/ <dig> transcripts including messages with rarely observed pattern types . the predominant post challenge pattern was e <dig> for animal 2-lam and animal  <dig>  which was consistent with the response to lps, and consistent with responses to injury . this was in contrast to animal  <dig>  which did not alter 185/ <dig> expression in response to lam, but continued to express e <dig>  despite changes in sp <dig> expression that indicated that the immune response had been activated.

dsrna challenge
all three animals  challenged with dsrna expressed similarly sized 185/ <dig> transcripts . prior to injection, all expressed the major  <dig>  kb band, even though the absence of sp <dig> expression suggested that all animals were immunoquiescent. expression of sp <dig> in these animals increased in response to challenge, indicating immune activation. after challenge, all three animals continued to express the  <dig>  kb fragment, while animal 2-dsrna and animal  <dig> expressed additional larger  transcripts. at  <dig> h, animal 2-dsrna expressed an additional ~ <dig>  kb band, the only time a message of this size was observed on gels.

most of the clones isolated and sequenced from animal 2-dsrna both before  and after  challenge with dsrna were the e <dig>  pattern, although the e <dig> pattern was also isolated after challenge  . similarly, animal  <dig> expressed the e <dig>  pattern both before  and after  challenge. only four 185/ <dig> message patterns were obtained from animal  <dig>  of which all were identified in animal  <dig> and/or animal 2-dsrna. the major pattern expressed by animal  <dig> was e <dig>  both before  and after  challenge. among the three animals analyzed, the sizes  and element patterns  of the 185/ <dig> transcripts appeared to be unaffected by dsrna challenge, which was the only pamp that did not induce obvious changes in the element patterns for the 185/ <dig> messages.

response to injury
because each pamp was suspended in acf, injections of acf into two animals  served as injury controls . animal  <dig> expressed a multitude of transcripts ranging in size from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb before injury and at  <dig> h after injection. however, by  <dig> h, only the  <dig>  kb fragment was observed. expression of sp <dig> was only observed at  <dig> h, indicating that animal  <dig> was immunoquiescent prior to injury. sequences of clones from animal  <dig> before injury yielded three different element patterns with e <dig>  as the major pattern . after injury,  <dig> element patterns were identified , the majority of which were e <dig> .

animal  <dig> expressed three message sizes prior to injury and at  <dig> h after injection of acf . at  <dig> h post injury, sp <dig> expression remained undetectable, suggesting that the immune response had not been activated. therefore, a second injection of acf was given at  <dig> h, and by  <dig> h , expression of sp <dig> indicated that the animal had activated its immune system. the  <dig>  kb 185/ <dig> transcript was first observed at  <dig> h and remained until  <dig> h post injury, becoming the predominant transcript at  <dig> h. the major element pattern expressed in animal  <dig> prior to injury was c <dig> . after injection of acf, six different element patterns were identified from  <dig> clones with d <dig>  and e <dig>  as the most common patterns. overall, the animals responding to injury predominantly expressed element patterns c <dig> and/or e <dig>  prior to injury and e <dig> after injury, although there were differences in the minor patterns expressed in each animal.

animal 2
analysis of 185/ <dig> expression in a single sea urchin challenged with different pamps over time was valuable due to the  <dig> % difference among genomes of individual sea urchins  <cit> . we have assumed that this level of genetic variation among individuals would create differences in immune responses and make comparisons difficult. therefore, we followed a single individual through the experimental protocol to eliminate the possibility that the observed differences in 185/ <dig> expression were the result of individual variations rather than differential responses to the pamps. animal  <dig> received separate injections of lps, lam, and dsrna in that order during the study. the animal was rested for  <dig> months after the lps challenge and  <dig> months after challenge with lam and the entire experiment required over  <dig> years to complete, including  <dig> months that the animal was housed in our aquaria without manipulation before the initial injection of lps. because the life span estimate for s. purpuratus is about  <dig> years  <cit> , an increase in age by four years for animal  <dig> was not expected to have an impact on immune responsiveness. the level of immune activation for animal  <dig> was monitored by the expression of sp <dig> before and after each challenge. sp <dig> was not expressed prior to challenge with lps and lam, indicating immunoquiescence, but was expressed at low levels prior to dsrna challenge, suggesting only down-regulation of the immune response . animal  <dig> expressed a set of 185/ <dig> transcripts with a variety of element patterns in response to lps, lam and dsrna. prior to challenge with lps, c <dig> was the only pattern identified , whereas after challenge, e <dig> was the most common pattern . upon return to immunoquiescence and prior to lam challenge, animal  <dig> expressed both e <dig> and e <dig>  . following challenge with lam, the animal again predominantly expressed e <dig> . however, both before and after challenge with dsrna, animal  <dig> primarily expressed element pattern e <dig>  . although the lack of sp <dig> expression or its low expression prior to each of the three challenges suggested that animal  <dig> had returned to immunoquiescence, the animal expressed different 185/ <dig> patterns before each challenge, which may suggest that it had retained a low response level to the previous challenge. given that animal  <dig> did not appear to have responded to dsrna by changing the expressed 185/ <dig> element patterns, it is noteworthy that it switched from expressing pattern e <dig>  to pattern e <dig> in response to lps and lam. not only did animal  <dig> exhibit variation in the 185/ <dig> responses to challenges, but also showed variations in the expressed element patterns between challenges.

sequence diversity
in addition to the variety of element patterns present in the 185/ <dig> mrnas, significant nucleotide sequence diversity was observed that resulted in different deduced amino acid sequences in the encoded proteins . the mrna diversity was analyzed in two ways: 1) ratios of nonsynonymous vs. synonymous  nucleotide substitutions, and 2) entropy-based sequence diversity scores  <cit> . dn/ds ratios of greater than  <dig>  indicate that genes are under selective pressure for diversification  <cit> . diversity scores are based on the frequency of different nucleotides present at each position within a given alignment and are influenced by any nucleotide change, regardless of whether or not that change alters the protein sequence  <cit> .

nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios
dn/ds values were obtained from individual sea urchins for sets of cdnas  that had three or more members . the c <dig> element pattern from animal 2-lps prior to challenge had a dn/ds ratio greater than  <dig>  as did the e <dig> pattern from animal  <dig> after lam challenge. for the two animals that served as the injury controls, element pattern c <dig> in animal  <dig> prior to challenge and pattern e <dig> in animal  <dig> after challenge also had elevated dn/ds ratios.

the dn/ds scores for 185/ <dig> sequences had been calculated previously from cdnas obtained from a library derived from coelomocytes pooled from five sea urchins  <cit> . in comparing the dn/ds scores of 185/ <dig> sequences from individual animals, we found that they were lower than those from pooled mrna. this difference may be due either to the genetic variation among animals  <cit>  or to different complexities of immunogens that were used to challenge the animals. to test this, the dn/ds ratios were calculated for all e <dig> sequences isolated in this study  and were compared to the dn/ds ratio reported previously for e <dig>  from five animals used to construct the cdna library  <cit> . notably, the dn/ds ratio for the nine animals in this study was  <dig> , whereas that for the previous dataset was  <dig> . the difference between these results was unlikely due to differences in methods used to generate the clones . it was more likely that the set of 185/ <dig> messages expressed by five animals responding to a complex mixture of marine bacteria  <cit>  was more diverse than the messages expressed by nine animals responding to specific pamps.

element diversity
in an effort to characterize the diversity among the elements and to identify possible hypervariable regions, diversity scores were calculated for specific elements before and after challenge. the diversity score of element  <dig> increased more than three fold after challenge with lps and lam, but did not change in response to dsrna or injury . sequence diversity in the remaining elements expressed in response to lps, lam, dsrna, or injury did not show discernable changes compared to pre-challenge diversity. similar results were obtained from an analysis of elements in messages from animal  <dig> responding to all three pamps . therefore, despite changes in expressed element patterns in response to challenge, the sequence diversity of individual elements did not change . furthermore, the 185/ <dig> sequences from individual sea urchins did not reveal elements or regions that were hypervariable, which was in agreement with the previous report  <cit> .

diversity of cdna sets
diversity scores were also calculated for sets of cdnas . for all animals in which e <dig> and e <dig>  were expressed, diversity scores for e <dig> consistently increased after challenge, whereas changes in e <dig>  diversity scores were variable . when cdna sets from individuals were combined for both pre- and post-challenge, diversity scored tended to be higher than when pre- and post-challenge sets were calculated independently . although there were some exceptions to this result, it suggested that, although the same patterns were present both before and after challenge, different sequence variants of messages with the same element patterns were expressed at different times during an immune challenge.

diversity scores were also calculated for sequences collected from all animals responding to the same pamp . comparisons showed that scores increased in response to lam and dsrna. on the other hand, scores decreased for animals injected with lps, and scores for the injury controls remained about the same. this indicated that a set of 185/ <dig> messages with increased diversity was expressed in response to lam and dsrna, whereas lps and injury did not induce a similar response.

because the e <dig> pattern was the only message type expressed by all animals, the diversity of this pattern type was calculated and compared to the e <dig> diversity scores from individuals. when all e <dig> sequences were analyzed, the diversity score was  <dig> , which was equal to or greater than the diversity scores obtained from each of the e <dig> sets from individual animals . this suggested that although all animals expressed e <dig>  the nucleotide diversity of this pattern was higher among the population than within individuals. however, because the dn/ds score for e <dig> was low, the variability in the nucleotide sequence inferred from the diversity scores indicated that the nucleotide changes did not have a greatly alter the amino acid sequence. overall, diversity scores of cdna sets from individual animals were lower than scores for sets of sequences from all nine animals. the implication was that sea urchins share 185/ <dig> genes that have common element patterns, but that the common patterns do not share identical sequence.

animal  <dig> injected with each pamp
diversity scores and dn/ds ratios of cdnas collected from animal  <dig> were compared among the three challenges . element patterns e <dig> and e <dig>  were expressed in animal  <dig> both pre- and post-challenge and were employed in an analysis of sequence variability. the dn/ds ratios for e <dig> and e <dig>  increased in response to challenge while diversity scores remained about the same. this indicated that although the nucleotide diversity did not change in response to immune challenge, the sequence variation present after challenge  likely led to changes in the amino acid sequence.

early stop codons
in addition to introducing changes in the deduced amino acid sequence, sequence diversity also introduced frame shifts and altered the positions of stop codons. previous analysis had established the locations of three possible stop codons associated with element  <dig>  <cit> . sequence analysis showed that in addition to the stop codons in element  <dig>  50% of the cdnas had an early stop in a different element. of the eight general pattern types  that were identified in this study, five  had members with a stop codon positioned 5' of element  <dig> . four of the patterns with an early stop codon  had a snp that changed a translated codon to a stop codon. the remaining patterns had small indels which introduced frame shifts  that led to missense sequence and an early stop codon. if translated, these variations in the mrnas would result in truncated proteins.

discussion
previous reports analyzed cdnas from coelomocytes pooled from five animals challenged with a mixture of marine bacteria  <cit> . this led to the identification of the 185/ <dig> transcripts, a diverse family of messages expressed in response to immune challenge  <cit> . the current study presents a simplified approach for investigating the expression patterns of 185/ <dig> genes by challenging individual animals with small amounts of single pamps. the substantial diversity evident in the 185/ <dig> sequences is illustrated by the identification of  <dig> different element patterns in this study  plus  <dig> element patterns described previously  <cit> . from these two sources of cdnas, nine element patterns are shared for a total of  <dig> different patterns identified from  <dig> sea urchins. when the nucleotide sequences were compared for these two data sets, 62% of the messages were unique and the c <dig> element patterns  were shared between the sets .

changes in element patterns
the sea urchins employed in this study expressed different 185/ <dig> genes in response to various pamps. changes in the expression of messages with different element patterns were identified by sequencing cdna clones isolated from nine animals. the general trend in 185/ <dig> expression in response to each pamp indicated a shift from primarily c <dig> and e <dig>  expression in immunoquiescent coelomocytes to e <dig> as the predominant element pattern after challenge . the shift from c <dig> to e <dig> was a significant change in the message and the encoded protein, implying a change in gene expression after immune challenge. the shift from e <dig>  to e <dig> was significant as well, because the presence of a snp that changed the position of the first stop codon caused a major change in the putative translated protein. this trend was not observed for animals responding to dsrna, which maintained expression of the e <dig>  pattern after challenge. it has been noted previously that the 185/ <dig> response to injury progresses more slowly than responses to bacteria  <cit> . unlike the response to lps and lam, the animals responding to injury tended to express patterns e <dig> and d <dig> patterns . although there were differences in element patterns expressed in different animals, animal  <dig> demonstrated that individual sea urchins most likely expressed different patterns over time and in response to different challenges.

in addition to the expression of major element patterns, each animal expressed an array of mrnas with rarely observed element patterns that were generally not shared among individuals. in response to immune challenge, the number of different rare element patterns expressed in individual sea urchins increased in seven of  <dig> animals . the number of rare element patterns increased in all groups of animals responding to all pamps  and  <dig> of  <dig> rare patterns were present only after challenge . the rare patterns constituted an interesting aspect of the diversity in 185/ <dig> expression after challenge. these results suggested that there may be a suite of genes found in all sea urchins that encode the most common or major element patterns and that there may be a much larger number of genes encoding rare or minor element patterns that are present in low frequencies within the population.

185/ <dig> sequence diversity
extensive nucleotide diversity was present in the 185/ <dig> cdna sequences such that 60% of sequences were unique  and 50% of the cdnas had a premature stop codon. many of the clones with early stop codons were found only once, but others  were identified multiple times with identical element patterns and early stop codons in identical positions. one obvious source of the observed message diversity would be sequence diversity within the 185/ <dig> gene family. however, preliminary sequence analysis of more than  <dig> unique 185/ <dig> genes shows that, except for one pseudogene with an unusual deletion, there were no early stop codons or frame shifts within the two exons . this implies that post-transcriptional processing of an unknown nature may be altering mrna sequences.

the deduced proteins have an n-terminal glycine-rich region and a c-terminal histidine-rich region  <cit> . messages with early stop codons would putatively encode truncated 185/ <dig> proteins that include only portions of these two regions. the most common 185/ <dig> patterns, c <dig> and e <dig>  had stop codons at expected positions in element  <dig> and encoded proteins with  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. however, e <dig>  had an early stop in element  <dig> such that the e <dig>  protein would only have  <dig> amino acids consisting of the glycine-rich region and missing most of the c-terminal histidine-rich region. although the functionality of the proteins encoded by these abbreviated transcripts is unknown, it is an intriguing possibility that the glycine-rich region of the 185/ <dig> proteins may have functions that can be altered by the absence of the histidine-rich region. functional truncated proteins are unusual, but some have been demonstrated in other systems  <cit> . preliminary analysis of 185/ <dig> protein sizes indicates that not only do these proteins appear to multimerize, but they reveal intermediate sizes not predicted by a single full-length cdna . consequently, the transcripts with early stop codons may be translated and perhaps some of the truncated proteins have a role in 185/ <dig> activity.

gene expression
message diversity appeared to be influenced by both the type of challenge and the individual responding to the challenge. previous work indicates that large doses of marine bacteria induce the 185/ <dig> response within  <dig> h  <cit> , while small doses of lps and other pamps induce response more slowly. animals responding to lps showed decreases in sequence diversity after challenge in addition to changes in element patterns. this may indicate that the lps-induced response selectively alters transcription to a smaller set of 185/ <dig> genes that would putatively encode proteins that may have some association with lps. on the other hand, animals injected with dsrna did not show a change in the element patterns of the 185/ <dig> messages even though nucleotide sequence diversity of those messages increased after challenge. consequently, it was difficult to determine whether sea urchins respond to viral molecular signatures. because nothing is known about sea urchin-specific viruses, it is not clear whether polygc is recognized as a threat, and it is also not clear whether the antiviral response involves 185/ <dig> proteins. recent studies in shrimp show that dsrna of low complexity may not induce responses to the same degree as highly complex dsrna  <cit> . alternatively, the rate of the sea urchin response to dsrna may be slower than that observed for lps and lam, and the lack of obvious changes in element patterns may be the result of terminating the experiment too early. the beginnings of responses to dsrna may have been present because both animal 2-dsrna and animal  <dig> showed post-challenge increases in messages of the e <dig> pattern, and all of the animals showed elevated sequence diversity.

the response to lam was not striking. two of the three animals responding to lam showed the switch to e <dig> expression after challenge, but there was only a small increase in sequence diversity. β- <dig> -glucan is isolated from giant kelp, laminaria, and because kelp is a favored food of the purple sea urchin, this molecular pattern may not be recognized as a strong immunogen. on the other hand, the 185/ <dig> proteins may not interact with fungal immunogens. injury did not induce a change in sequence diversity of the messages, which was unlike responses to pamps.

changes in message prevalence are typically attributed to changes in transcriptional activity of the genes or to decreases in the rate of message degradation. yet it is feasible that changes in the messages could also be the result of changes in subpopulations of coelomocytes responding to immune challenge. preliminary results indicate that the 185/ <dig> proteins are expressed in two subpopulations of phagocytes, of which one increases in numbers in response to lps . however, for a change in coelomocyte populations to alter the types and prevalence of specific 185/ <dig> mrna, there must be a restricted expression of 185/ <dig> genes in specific coelomocytes. restricted gene expression has been noted for vlr genes in lamprey lymphocytes  <cit> , has been proposed as a theory for sea urchin tlrs  <cit>  , and is theoretically feasible for 185/333-positive coelomocytes. however, verification of this notion will require analysis of 185/ <dig> expression in single coelomocytes.

because the sequence diversity and element patterns changed during the 185/ <dig> response to different pamps in individuals, this implies that sea urchins may have mechanisms to differentiate between the foreign molecular patterns that may dictate the regulation of 185/ <dig> gene expression. the purple sea urchin has a large family of toll-like receptors  that are expressed on coelomocytes  <cit> . speculation on function of tlrs suggests that they may be restricted in expression to a few per coelomocyte and that possible combinatorial interactions on coelomocyte cell surfaces may result in diverse yet highly specific pathogen recognition capabilities  <cit> . although the analysis of the 185/ <dig> gene promoters is underway, it is not currently known whether the tlr detection system is involved in the regulation of this gene family. however, the estimated size of the 185/ <dig> gene family and the diversity of the 185/ <dig> response appears to fit with the complexity of the tlr genes.

large gene families
immune systems typically have large gene families, as exemplified by the ig family, which includes the novel immune-type receptor  genes in fish  <cit>  and the frep genes in snails  <cit> . often, immune genes are closely linked, which is a locus structure that appears to promote gene duplication and sequence diversification, and is an organization that has been noted for frep genes  <cit> . large families of linked genes in the sea urchin are also putatively associated with immune function including tlrs and nlrs  <cit> . many of the sea urchin tlr genes are closely linked and show sequence diversity in the lrr domains, a result that is reminiscent of lrr domain diversity in the plant r genes, which are also closely linked  <cit> . similarly, the 185/ <dig> genes are present in the genome as a large family of very closely linked genes  and this may promote sequence diversification for this family as well. although rag homologues have been identified in the sea urchin genome  <cit> , it is not known whether the echinoderm recombinases are involved in immune diversification. consequently, for organisms lacking higher vertebrate mechanisms for somatic diversification of immune genes, a number of alternative mechanisms are expected to exist to maintain an edge in the arms race with the pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
there are several conclusions that can be drawn from the data presented here. changes in element patterns and sequence diversity of the 185/ <dig> mrnas occurred in response to immune challenge and the encoded proteins may be directed towards specific pamps. however, changes in element patterns did not always correlate with changes in sequence diversity of mrnas . the predominantly expressed element patterns changed in response to lps, lam and injury, but not in response to dsrna. sequence diversity increased for lam and dsrna, decreased for lps, and did not change in response to injury. although challenge with either lam or dsrna caused an increase in nucleotide diversity, decreased sequence diversity was observed after lps challenge, possibly indicating transcription of a smaller set of genes. due to the minimal changes in element patterns following challenge, it was possible that sea urchins may not have recognized polygc as pathogenic. differential responses to the pamps indicated that sea urchins could differentiate among the molecular patterns and mount different responses to those challenges.

the striking diversity of the sequences among the small sample of animals reported here and previously  <cit>  implies that the variety of the 185/ <dig> sequences within the population is large. there may be a core set of genes that are shared among all purple sea urchins that are augmented by a large number of genes that are more rare in the population. preliminary work on the structure of the 185/ <dig> gene locus suggests that the number and orientation of 185/ <dig> genes may promote diversification as has been shown for r genes in plants  <cit> . future work in the area of innate immune diversification is expected to reveal a multitude of mechanisms to accomplish this end in a variety of organisms.
