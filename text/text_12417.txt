BACKGROUND
generation of mature human t cells from adult bone marrow  cd34+hpcs in vitro may overcome two major limitations in t cell therapy, namely hla disparity and immune tolerance. patients undergoing chemotherapy or with hiv infection suffer from prolonged lymphodepletion leading to opportunistic infections and mortality  <cit> . hematopoietic stem cell transplant  has been used to reconstitute the immune system in such patients  <cit> . however, t cells take the longest time to recover after hsct  <cit> . thus ex vivo differentiation of t cells using an in vitro op <dig> stromal cell line expressing notch ligand, delta like- <dig> , has been of tremendous interest  <cit> . recent reports showed that the op9dl <dig> stromal cell culture system established by zuniga-pflucker can support terminal maturation of cord blood  and post natal thymus derived cd34+hpcs  <cit> . in case of immune rejection of cb hpcs due to hla disparity or limited availability, bm cd34+hpcs may serve as a convenient source as they can be obtained from patient’s own bm  <cit> . we and others have demonstrated that adult bm-derived cd34+hpcs, from both normal adults and patients undergoing chemotherapy, yields a low number of t cell precursors in vitro <cit> . t cell development of adult human bm derived cd34+hpcs in the op <dig> dl <dig> culture system is less well studied due to low cellular yields when compared to the cb counterparts. in addition, terminal t cell differentiation from adult human bm derived cd34+hpcs in vitro has not yet been demonstrated  <cit> .

we have previously reported that lentivector-modified op <dig> cell lines expressing various cytokines and growth factors supported enhanced hpc and dendritic cell precursor expansion and differentiation  <cit> . to overcome the limited proliferation of bm hpcs in vitro, we modified a previously defined lmdl <dig> cell line   <cit> , to ectopically express t cell developmental factors il- <dig> and flt3l, and established lmdl1-fl <dig> cell line. we found that lmdl1-fl <dig> provided a proliferative advantage to adult bm cd34+hpcs over lmdl <dig> cell line supplemented with soluble recombinant hil- <dig> and hflt3l.

during t cell development, the cd34+cd8-cd4- double negative  thymocytes differentiate through cd3-cd8+ immature single positive stage  in mice and cd3-cd4+ isp in humans, followed by cd3locd4+cd8+ double positive , cd3+tcrαβ+dp and then cd3+tcrαβ+cd4+ or cd8+ mature single positive t cells  <cit> . we observed that the transition of cd3lo dp to cd3+tcrαβ+ dp stage, an intermediate stage that precedes the terminal maturation to cd <dig> or cd <dig> t cell lineage, is inefficient during adult bm t cell development in vitro <cit> . il- <dig> plays an inhibitory role during dn to dp transition in mice  <cit>  and signaling via cd3/pre-tcr complex plays a permissive role in transition from cd3lo dp to cd3+ tcrαβ+ dp  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that the inefficient pre-tcr signaling is either due to continued presence of il- <dig> or due to inefficient stimulation via cd <dig> receptor. here we report that intermittent il- <dig> withdrawal alone did not result in efficient differentiation to cd3+tcrαβ+ dp stage. importantly, taking a combination approach of il- <dig> withdrawal and activating pre-tcr signaling using anti-cd3/cd <dig> antibodies, we demonstrate for the first time in vitro differentiation of adult bm hpcs to cd3+tcrαβ+ dp stage and subsequent functional maturation of cd <dig> t cells. our findings provide a better understanding of the factors involved in proliferation and differentiation of bm derived hpcs to mature t cells in vitro.

RESULTS
op9-dl <dig> cells ectopically expressing flt3l and il- <dig> support enhanced t cell precursor expansion
the previously established mouse op9-dl <dig> cell line, lmdl <dig>  <cit> , was infected with lentivectors expressing human flt3l, or both flt3l and il- <dig>  to generate lmdl1-fl and lmdl1-fl <dig> cell lines, respectively . rna was harvested and analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr to confirm transgene expression in these cell lines . we confirmed surface expression of dl <dig> on all three cell lines, lmdl <dig>  lmdl1-fl and lmdl1-fl <dig> . both lmdl1-fl and lmdl1-fl <dig> expressed high levels of flt3l on cell surface and in culture as determined by flow cytometry and elisa, respectively . the secretion of il- <dig> by lmdl1-fl <dig> was measured via elisa to be in the range of 10– <dig> ng/ml after  <dig> hr of culture . 

to examine the differentiation and expansion potential of adult human bm cd34+ hpcs co-cultured with lmdl <dig> exogenously supplemented with recombinant human flt3l  and il- <dig> , or co-cultured with lmdl1-fl <dig>  we determined the proliferation rate of the incubated cells by counting total number of suspension cells at various time points in three independent experiments. the result showed that cd34+ hpcs cells, when co-cultured with lmdl1-fl <dig> for  <dig> days, expanded up to five fold more than those co-cultured with lmdl <dig> supplemented with recombinant flt3l and il- <dig> . thus, lmdl1-fl <dig> was superior to lmdl <dig> in supporting t cell precursor proliferation.

adult bm cd34+ hpcs co-cultured on lmdl1-fl <dig> or lmdl <dig> supplemented with il- <dig> and flt3l follow similar t cell differentiation kinetics but do not undergo functional t cell maturation
next, we analyzed surface expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd1a, cd <dig>  tcrαβ and tcrγδ of the differentiating cells in the two co-culture systems. kinetics of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd1a were comparable between the two systems. we observed cd <dig> isp from day  <dig>  to day  <dig>  and increased cd <dig> isp after day  <dig> . t cell lineage commitment from hpcs is defined by upregulation of cd <dig>  followed by cd1a expression which is decreased upon further maturation. a schematic illustration of the predicted key events and phenotypes of developing t cell precursors is shown at top of figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we detected surface cd <dig> on day  <dig> , and peaked expression of cd <dig> and cd1a around day  <dig>  followed by a gradual decrease of cd1a. due to the low cell number in the lmdl1 + il- <dig> + flt3l coculture, we had limited cells for analysis in the early time points. in both systems, dp cells appeared around day  <dig> and decreased by day  <dig>  the timing of appearance of cd <dig> isp and dp varied depending on the donor, and was similar between the two systems. the rapid expansion of t cell precursors in co-culture with lmdl1-fl <dig>  which continuously produced flt3l and il- <dig>  was accompanied by a slower transition into dp and cd <dig> positive stage, as both dp cells and cd <dig> surface expression were detected at lower levels in lmdl1-fl <dig> co-culture than in lmdl1 + il- <dig> + flt3l coculture . nevertheless, neither system produced cd3hitcrhi cd <dig> or cd <dig> cell population . the analysis of tcrγδ surface markers detected no γδ lineage diversification in lmdl1-fl <dig> co-culture but some in lmdl1 + il- <dig> + flt3l . thus, we conclude that no functionally mature t cells could be generated from the adult bm-derived cd34+ hpcs in the in vitro cultures.

il- <dig> deprivation alone does not induce efficient dn to dp transition
in murine t cell development, il- <dig> plays a negative role during transition of dn to dp t cells  <cit> . human thymocytes have been reported to lose il- <dig> dependency upon reaching cd7/cd1a dp stage  <cit> . we found that day  <dig> cells were always negative for cd1a expression; hence we chose this time point for il- <dig> deprivation to ensure that the cells were in il- <dig> dependent phase of development. to assess the effect of il- <dig> deprivation on dn to dp transition, we cultured adult cd34+ hpcs on lmdl1-fl <dig> for  <dig> days, followed by continued presence  or deprivation  of il- <dig>  i.e., on lmdl1-fl <dig> or lmdl1-flt3l, for additional 10– <dig> days and analyzed the expression of cd <dig>  cd1a, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  tcrαβ and tcrγδ. we observed a decline in cell survival post il- <dig> withdrawal indicative of il- <dig> dependence . we detected an increase in il-7ra expression upon il- <dig> withdrawal . additionally, we observed an increase in percentage of dp cells; however, these cells lacked cd3hi tcrαβhi phenotype . thus, il- <dig> deprivation alone is not sufficient to induce cd3hi tcrαβhi dp transition of adult human t cell precursors on the op <dig> culture system. 

il- <dig> withdrawal does not increase t cell receptor excision circle  in the developing t cell precursors
during t cell development, dn t cell precursors rearrange their tcr beta chain first, which is expressed with pre-tcr alpha to form a pre-tcr complex  <cit> . signaling via pre-tcr complex results in allelic exclusion at tcrβ locus, but initiates rearrangement at the tcrα locus and promotes dp transition  <cit> . rearrangement at the tcrα locus can be evaluated by the presence of trec, an episomal circular piece of dna formed due to excision of delta locus upon tcrα rearrangement  <cit> . in order to assess the frequency of αβ precursors, we analyzed trec content in the developing t cell precursors by genomic pcr. the results showed that cells from day  <dig> and day  <dig> were negative, but from day  <dig> were positive for trec . we quantified trec via quantitative pcr analysis using cloned trec and rag <dig> as standards   <cit> . our results showed that < 1% cells were positive for trec on day  <dig>  and il- <dig> deprivation had no effect on trec content . rt-pcr analysis of rnas showed that this was not due to the lack of rag or tcf1/lef gene expression . this result suggests that only a small percent of cells underwent rearrangement at tcrα locus in the in vitro system. 

adult human hpcs can differentiate to dp t cells and adopt a cd <dig> t cell lineage in vitro upon il- <dig> deprivation followed by anti-cd <dig> stimulation
signaling via pre-tcr complex, composed of tcrβ, pre-tcrα and cd <dig> is crucial for αβ t cell development  <cit> . pre-tcr is thought to signal in a ligand independent fashion, possibly through oligomerization  <cit> . pre-tcr signaling can be mimicked by anti-cd <dig> antibody stimulation, as in vivo administration of anti-cd <dig> antibody induces dn to dp transition in rag2−/− pre-tα−/− mice  <cit> . also, treatment of fetal thymus organ culture  from tcrβ−/−, rag2−/− or scid mice with anti-cd <dig> antibodies induces dn to dp transition  <cit> . thus, we tested if anti-cd <dig> stimulation of t cell precursors obtained from lmdl co-cultures can induce differentiation to dp stage. in order to maximize cell-cell contact for efficient stimulation, we transferred cells of both il- <dig> present and il- <dig> deprived groups to u bottom  <dig> well plates, in a stromal cell free environment and supplemented with anti-cd3/cd <dig> antibody-conjugated beads. we found that il- <dig> deprived precursors proliferated upon anti-cd <dig> engagement but il- <dig> present group did not, as demonstrated by the fold increase in cell number and intracellular ki <dig> staining . on the other hand, tcr activation of the il- <dig> present group did not induce proliferation. additionally, percentage of trec positive cells increased to ~13% in the il- <dig> deprived, anti-cd <dig> stimulated group of cells, indicating increased tcrα rearrangement . 

we next examined t cell maturation markers  <dig> weeks post stimulation after deprivation of il- <dig>  we observed low cd <dig> expression and no tcrαβ expression in il- <dig> present and anti-cd <dig> stimulated group . interestingly, anti-cd <dig> stimulated cells from the il- <dig> deprived group displayed a robust transition from cd3lotcrαβlodp to cd3+tcrαβ+dp and cd4+ sp t cells . additionally, we found that the cells were mostly negative for cd <dig> nk cell marker expression . the timing of il- <dig> deprivation and anti-cd <dig> stimulation was critical, as il- <dig> deprivation post day  <dig> and subsequent anti-cd <dig> simulation did not induce t cell differentiation and maturation . thus, we conclude that il- <dig> deprivation is necessary but not sufficient to promote dp transition and subsequent anti-cd <dig> stimulation plays a critical role in t cell maturation. to see if the in vitro developed cd <dig> t cells were functional t cells, we further assessed effector functions by ifn-γ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion in response to pma and ionomycin. the results showed that upon stimulation, the in vitro derived cd <dig> t cells displayed effector t cell functions similar to that of peripheral blood cd <dig> t cells .

vβ repertoire analysis of the in vitro generated cd <dig> t cells
to evaluate the tcr diversity of the in vitro-derived t lymphocytes, we performed vβ repertoire analysis for  <dig> vβ families of human tcr. the in vitro derived cd4+ sp t cells were stained with the iotest® panel of antibodies. the majority of the in vitro differentiated t cells from adult bm hpcs  displayed a skewed vβ distribution pattern, e.g. increased populations of vβ  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively,  as compared with the control pbmcs, which showed an evenly distributed pattern. note that one of the in vitro derived t cells, donor  <dig>  showed a less skewed vβ distribution pattern. the quantitative analysis of multiple samples is summarized in figure 8b. we further examined vβ distributions of healthy donor pbmcs stimulated by anti-cd3/cd <dig> ab or pha for three weeks, and demonstrated that the entire cd <dig> vβ clones were evenly expanded without substantial skewing . together, we found that the vβ repertoires of the in vitro-derived cd <dig> t lymphocytes were highly restricted compared with those of normal adult cd <dig> t cells.

discussion
in vitro adult human bm hpc-derived functional t cells have great potential for therapeutic applications, as this approach provides donor hla-matched t cells that may be genetically engineered to fight infections, cancer or to treat immunodeficiencies. murine hpcs, human cb and post-natal thymic hpcs undergo full maturation in the op9-dl <dig> culture system  <cit> . however, adult human bm hpcs undergo limited proliferation and are arrested at cd3locd4+cd8+ dp stage of t cell development  <cit> . in this report, we demonstrated that cell-based il- <dig> and flt3l provided a proliferative advantage to adult bm hpcs over exogenously supplemented recombinant il- <dig> and flt3l. we then took a combination approach of il- <dig> withdrawal and activating pre-tcr signaling using anti-cd3/cd <dig> antibodies, which successfully overcame the arrest in cd3locd4+cd8+ dp stage and induced differentiation to cd3+tcrαβ+cd4+cd8+ dp stage, and subsequent maturation to cd <dig> t cells. our findings provide a better understanding of the factors involved in proliferation and differentiation of adult bm-derived hpcs in vitro.

lmdl1-fl <dig> was superior in supporting t cell precursor proliferation when compared to lmdl <dig> supplemented with exogenous flt3l and il- <dig>  the mechanism that enhanced precursor proliferation on lmdl1-fl <dig> remains to be elucidated. it is possible that concentration or cell-based modifications, or both, could contribute to the enhanced proliferation. as all three cell lines, lmdl <dig>  lmdl1-fl and lmdl1-fl <dig> expressed high levels of mdl <dig> , differential dl <dig> expression level does not seem to play a role. flt3l is expressed as a soluble as well as membrane bound form  <cit> , and glycosylated form of il- <dig> has been reported  <cit> . besides soluble factors, cell-cell interactions play a critical role in t cell development. our results appear to point to the importance of cell-based modification of cytokines, as use of glycosylated il- <dig> for clinical trials is being considered  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that a high dose of il- <dig> has a modest effect on increasing the absolute cell number during t cell development  <cit> . these studies support our view that exogenously added cytokine dose has limited effects on t cell development.

while the t cell development potential such as occurrence of cd <dig> isp and dp cells were comparable for both culture systems, some differences exist, such as cd <dig> expression and development of tcrγδ cells. cell-free or cell-cell signaling of the cytokines may account for the differences in proliferation and differentiation of the two systems. nevertheless, differentiation to dp stage was inefficient and neither system supported terminal t cell maturation. under both culture conditions, precursor proliferation rate declined beyond 30– <dig> days suggesting a discontinued dependence for il- <dig> and notch signals, consistent with previous reports  <cit> , as such, this culture system alone does not support continued differentiation of adult human t cell precursors to cd <dig> and tcrαβ-bearing dp cells.

signaling through il-7/il-7r supports survival and proliferation through dn <dig> stage in murine t cell development and the same is true for human t cell development  <cit> . in transgenic mice, expression of il- <dig> under the control of lck promoter at low levels enhances proliferation of developing αβ t cells, but at high levels, it reduces proliferation and displays a marked block in dp transition  <cit> . recent studies further support that il-7r signals impair differentiation of cd <dig> isp to dp cells in zap70−/− and il-7rα transgenic mice  <cit> , and il-7r signals inhibit the expression of hmg domain transcription factors tcf- <dig>  lef- <dig> and rorγt, factors important for pre-t to dp transition  <cit> . in addition, il- <dig> suppresses anti-cd <dig> antibody induced differentiation to dp stage in fetal thymus organ culture of rag1-deficient mice  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that il- <dig> withdrawal prior to isp might be necessary for efficient dp transition. while il- <dig> has been reported to display an inhibitory role in dp transition in murine t cell development, our results showed that the intermittent removal of il- <dig> in the in vitro co-culture only had a minimal effect on human t cell dp transition.

the mechanism by which il- <dig> inhibits t cell development is unclear. we observed abundant transcripts of tcf and lef in t cell precursors at various time points. thus, it seems unlikely that il- <dig> withdrawal promotes t cell development by de-repressing transcription of the above factors. our data suggest that il- <dig> does not inhibit trec formation, neither does it directly inhibit pre-tcr signaling. interestingly, an increase in cd <dig> surface expression post il- <dig> withdrawal may play a role in how these cells respond to anti-cd <dig> stimulation. as in human t cell development, cd4isp precede dp stage, it is possible that increased cd <dig> may account for increased responsiveness to anti-cd <dig> stimulation. alternative possibilities are, il- <dig> mediates its effect through stat- <dig> on transcription of genes necessary for pre-tcr expression and function, directly inhibits pre-tcr activation, or interferes with the tgfβ signaling pathway  <cit> . detailed evaluation of these possibilities requires further investigation.

il- <dig> mediates survival and proliferation of dn thymocytes  <cit> . in addition, il- <dig> is required for tcrγδ gene rearrangement and also induces tcrβ chain rearrangement  <cit> . in order to progress to the next dp maturation stage, dn/isp thymocytes must seize the rearrangement and express a functional tcrγδ or tcrαβ  <cit> . it is known that signaling via a functional tcr mediates allelic exclusion, survival and progression to sp stage  <cit> . interestingly, in mice il- <dig> signaling is inhibited at dp stage by down-regulating the il-7rα. in humans, il-7r is expressed but its binding partner γc is down-regulated and stat- <dig> responsiveness is lost  <cit> . hence it is tempting to speculate that il- <dig> signaling down-regulation might be an additional way of terminating rearrangement and preventing survival of t cells with non-functional tcrs. as both il- <dig> and tcr signaling deliver survival signals, the down-regulation of il- <dig> signaling ensures shutdown of an alternative survival pathway and selects for cells that respond to tcr signals. clearly, the change in il-7/il-7r signaling is physiologically important and the reason for such regulation might reside on the intracellular signaling of il-7/il-7r on t cell activation and fate decision: proliferation, death or differentiation.

during t cell development, the appearance of isp is dominated by cd <dig> isp in human and cd <dig> isp in mouse; pre-tcr signals drive proliferation, tcrα rearrangement, followed by the appearance of cd <dig> isp in mouse and cd <dig> isp in human. interestingly, we observed cd <dig> isp derived from human cd <dig> hpcs in vitro; we found a lack of proliferative burst and minimal rearrangement in the tcrα locus. thus, the cd <dig> isp may not be true isp generated by pre-tcr signals, rather a result of cytokine-mediated cd <dig> expression  <cit> .

t cell development is a complex process that involves multiple checkpoints and three-dimensional architecture composed of multiple cell types and compartments  <cit> . our results, as summarized in figure  <dig>  demonstrate that signaling via cd <dig> and cell-cell contact was sufficient to drive differentiation to dp and subsequent cd <dig> lineage commitment in the absence of thymic environment. as op <dig> cells do not express class ii mhc molecules but the developing human thymocytes do , the resulting cd <dig> cells are most likely selected by self mhc of the developing thymocytes. this alternate pathway of cd <dig> t cell development has been reported previously, especially in human t cell development  <cit> . our study is in agreement with recent reports demonstrating that human hpcs when transplanted into immune compromised mice, can develop into cd <dig> t cells  <cit> . such t cell development can occur via thymocyte-mediated selection, and does not require the presence of professional antigen presenting cells or epithelial cells expressing mhc-ii. the human cd <dig> t cells derived from nod/scid γc−/− mice receiving transplanted human hpcs display diverse v beta repertoire  <cit> . however, we found reduced diversity under the in vitro system illustrated by highly skewed vβ repertoire in most occasions. the three-dimensional environment in vivo, and the hla expression on thymocytes may account for such differences. it is possible that tcrβ rearrangement and β selection events are inefficient in this system and the rare cells with properly arranged tcrs are selected upon anti-cd <dig> stimulation. although one could challenge that expansion of contaminating t cells in the initial source of bm cd34+ hpcs may occur, we do not think this is possible as the fold increase post anti-cd <dig> stimulation would have been in a magnitude of over  <dig> fold in two weeks and we should also observed expansion of cd <dig> t cells along with cd <dig> t cells. thus, even though lineage commitment to cd <dig> t cells can be achieved independent of thymic microenvironment, the latter is required for establishing a balanced tcr repertoire, supporting negative selection as well as promoting cd <dig> lineage commitment. 

CONCLUSIONS
il- <dig> withdrawal is necessary but not sufficient for further differentiation to dp stage, and anti-cd <dig> stimulation plays a key role in inducing cd3+tcrαβ+dp transition and subsequent maturation to cd <dig> t cells. our findings further advance the experimental system required for in vitro modeling of adult human t cell differentiation, and will help develop novel approaches toward generating functional t cells from adult hpcs.
