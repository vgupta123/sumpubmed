BACKGROUND
when faced with rapidly changing climates, many species are expected to undergo widespread shifts in their distribution in order to maintain optimal physiological balance with their environment  <cit> . however, for species with fragmented habitats and those with limited dispersal capacities, range shifts may not be a viable option, and rapid adaptation may represent the only alternative to local extinction  <cit> . in order to predict the ability of these species to evolve in situ to changing environmental conditions, studies examining local adaptation along elevation gradients have emerged as model systems to predict the impact of climate change on species persistence and survival  <cit> .

the american pika  is a small alpine lagomorph with a discontinuous distribution throughout the mountain ranges of western north america  <cit> . pikas are typically restricted to high-elevation talus slope ecosystems, which provide close proximity to meadows for foraging and a complex habitat for behavioural thermoregulation  <cit> . american pikas likely originated from an asian ancestor that arrived in north america via the bering land bridge  <cit> . during the warming that followed the wisonsinan glaciation, paleontological evidence suggests that the distribution of o. princeps contracted northward and to higher elevations  <cit> , effectively stranding extant populations on high-elevation ‘habitat islands’. currently, the lower limits of o. princeps populations are constrained by an inability to tolerate thermal stress, while their high elevation distribution is enabled by adaptation to hypoxic environments  <cit> . the uniquely fragmented nature of their habitat has propelled o. princeps to a focal mammalian species for more general studies of metapopulation dynamics, island biogeography, and source-sink dynamics  <cit> .

pikas have also emerged as an important study species for investigating extinction risk in the face of rapidly changing climates  <cit> . unlike the majority of woodland montane fauna whose continuous habitat allows for cross-valley dispersal among mountain ranges, pikas reliance on high-elevation talus habitat precludes their ability for dispersal to cooler latitudes  <cit> . instead, it is hypothesized that the continued persistence of pikas will depend on in situ adaptation to changing climatic conditions, leading some to suggest that they may become the first mammalian species to go extinct due to the direct effects of climate change  <cit> . investigating the genetic basis of adaptation in pikas may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms by which contemporary evolution occurs in response to rapidly changing environments. however, this research is hindered by a lack of available genomic resources. for example, a recent genome scan using amplified fragment length polymorphisms  among populations continuously distributed along three elevation gradients  identified  <dig> outlier loci  putatively exhibiting signatures of divergent selection associated with summer mean maximum temperature and precipitation . yet, the anonymity of aflp loci precluded the identification of underlying genomic regions associated with these candidate loci.

the rise of next-generation sequencing technologies provides tools for rapidly generating dna sequence data for non-model organisms that have previously lacked genomic resources. when combined with statistical population genomics approaches  <cit> , these data can be used to test for signatures of natural selection in wild populations and identify candidate gene regions associated with local adaptation  <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphisms  have emerged as the marker of choice for population-level genotyping in the genomics era  <cit> . due to their high coverage across the genome, ease of genotyping, and direct relationship with underlying gene function, snps represent an improvement over conventional markers such as aflps and microsatellites for identifying genome-wide patterns of adaptive genetic variation  <cit> . despite their utility for population level studies, large-scale snp resources are still lacking for many species, including o. princeps.

the purpose of this study was to harness next-generation sequencing technology in order to elucidate elevation-specific patterns of sequence variation in o. princeps. we generated transcriptome-wide sequence data for pooled cdna libraries from high  and low  elevation sites along a previously established elevation gradient in the british columbia  coast mountains  <cit> . the resulting high coverage contigs and large suite of snp loci represent novel genomic resources for studying pika ecology, behaviour and population history, and enable direct investigations of potential biotic responses to changing environments.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
using the roche  <dig> gs flx titanium platform, we generated ~ <dig> million bases of transcriptome sequence data corresponding to  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> reads for the high and low elevation cdna libraries, respectively .

a de novo assembly was first carried out using the trimmed reads from both elevations in order to generate reference contigs; this assembly incorporated 66% of the transcriptome reads to produce  <dig>  contigs. we then mapped the raw reads back to these reference contigs separately for each elevation in order to generate a refined dataset consisting only of contigs that had a minimum average coverage of 5× for each elevation and a minimum length of  <dig> bases. the resulting dataset  consisted of  <dig>  contigs with a mean coverage of  <dig> reads per site . these contigs represent less than 1% of the o. princeps genome, which initial low coverage estimates indicate is  <dig>  gb in length  <cit> .

 <dig> in the high coverage dataset each contig has a minimum length of  <dig> bases and a minimum of 5× coverage for each ecotype.

 <dig> contigs composed of reads from a single elevation. minimum length =  <dig> bases; minimum coverage = 5×.

we performed an additional de novo assembly  of the high coverage contigs in order to identify sequences that either partially or totally overlapped. this assembly revealed some redundancy in the contig dataset. out of the  <dig>  contigs in the high coverage dataset,  <dig> contigs  aligned with one other contig, and  <dig> contigs  aligned with two or more other contigs. the remaining  <dig>  contigs  were unique and did not show similarity with any other contig.

transcriptome annotation
a blast search of all contigs in the high coverage dataset  produced  <dig>  positive hits . of the positive blast hits, only  <dig> were matches to sequences from ochotona sp., highlighting the current lack of genomic resources available for pikas;  <dig>  contigs had positive matches to published genes from the european rabbit , which is the closest model organism to o. princeps. of the contig sequences with positive blast match,  <dig>  were subsequently annotated with one or more gene ontology  terms .

snp detection
among the high coverage contigs ,  <dig>  had snps that fell within our detection parameters . the total number of snps identified was  <dig> , of which  <dig>  were polymorphic among pika from both elevations,  <dig>  were polymorphic in low elevation but fixed in high elevation pika, and  <dig>  were polymorphic in the high elevation but fixed in low elevation. there were  <dig> snps within our detection parameters that appeared to be fixed for alternate alleles in the two elevations. the ratio of transitions to transversions was  <dig> , and the difference in the frequency of the major allele between the two elevations ranged from < <dig> to 100% .

among these data, the frequency of snps that appear to be fixed at one elevation may be artificially inflated due to the small sample size  used to generate the transcriptome sequences. there is a high probability that low frequency alleles would not have been present among the individuals sampled. in addition, the snp detection parameters required a minimum coverage of eight reads at a polymorphic site to be included in the data. if the samples from one elevation had low coverage at a particular site, it would appear to be fixed even if there was variation present. these potential biases reflect the trade-off between avoiding false snps resulting from sequencing error, while attempting to account for all possible variation in the data.

snp validation
primer pairs were designed for  <dig> snp loci such that they amplified an ~ <dig> base pair fragment that contained a single snp . of these loci,  <dig> had successful pcr amplification, were free of introns, and produced sufficiently clear high resolution melt  signal to attempt the subsequent genotyping validation. high resolution melt analysis was then used to genotype  <dig> high and  <dig> low elevation o. princeps from the bella coola, bc study site as well as  <dig> samples collected at an independent location in the columbia river gorge, oregon, usa.

sanger re-sequencing of representative samples from each melt curve obtained from these  <dig> loci was used to assign genotypes to each cluster. from the panel of  <dig> snps for which sanger validation was attempted,  <dig> loci  yielded evidence of consistently scorable nucleotide polymorphism. sanger sequence data for the remaining nine loci confirmed that the expected snp site was indeed polymorphic, however, the resulting hrm curves were not sufficiently discrete to enable accurate genotype assignment . given that in these cases sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the expected polymorphism, we conclude that the failed assays were not due to errors with the initial snp detection but rather reflect the limitations of the hrm assays at those loci. for example, the presence of additional polymorphic sites within the amplicon  <cit>  and loci containing class  <dig>  or class  <dig>  snps  <cit>  may result in complicated or weakly differentiated clusters unsuitable for hrm genotyping.

eight of these  <dig> retained snp loci exhibited sequence similarity to structural or regulatory genes in the ncbi database . we found no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among any of the loci that were successfully typed in our samples. four of  <dig> loci showed a significant deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium , however each instance was restricted to a single elevation at one location .

* significant deviation from hwe; bold denotes that the locus was monomorphic in that population.

a x-linked locus.

all  <dig> loci tested were polymorphic among the  <dig> dna samples from bc. four of these loci were fixed for a single allele at high elevation and five loci were fixed for a single allele at low elevation , potentially indicating elevation-specific patterns in the distribution of genetic variation. the remaining eight loci were polymorphic at both elevations in bc.

among the dna samples from oregon, six loci were monomorphic. of the remaining  <dig> loci, four were fixed for a single allele at the high elevation and two were fixed for a single allele at the low elevation site. reduced genetic variation in samples from oregon is likely representative of ascertainment bias , given that transcriptome sequencing and initial snp discovery utilized tissue samples from bc.

mitochondrial dna
there was a high coverage of reads across all genes in the o. princeps mitochondrial genome , with  <dig>  trimmed reads  aligning to the published reference sequence. in addition, a blastx search of the high coverage dataset revealed  <dig> contigs that associated with the mitochondria.

of particular note, we detected multiple snps within two contigs  that sequence-similarity searches revealed corresponded to portions of the nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  region of the mitochondrial genome. two distinct haplotypes were detected across a total of eight polymorphic sites that associated with elevation in bc . three of these polymorphic sites were non-synonymous substitutions, two of which occurred in loop regions, while a third was found within a predicted transmembrane domain.

nadh dehydrogenase is the first and largest enzyme complex in the respiratory chain of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, and plays a central role in energy metabolism  <cit> . a broad-scale study of adaptive evolution of the mitochondrial genome of  <dig> placental mammals revealed signatures of positive selection in the nadh dehydrogenase complex, largely restricted to the loop regions of the proton pumps, including nd <dig>  <cit> . additional studies  <cit>  have also detected positively selected sites in nd <dig>  with adaptive changes in the piston arm suggested to have influenced fitness during the evolution of pacific salmon species  <cit> . future studies utilizing population level samples spanning the entire elevation gradient in bc are required to further investigate the role of nd <dig> in local adaptation of o. princeps across varying environments.

contigs unique to each elevation
additional datasets were generated containing contigs that were only composed of transcriptome reads from either the high or low elevation . blast searches  of these elevation-specific contigs produced  <dig> positive matches in the high elevation dataset  and  <dig> positive hits among contigs unique to low elevation .

interestingly, there was a high-elevation-specific contig  that was a strong match with the hemoglobin alpha chain from high elevation samples of both the chinese red pika  and the plateau pika , species restricted to high elevation steppes in asia . an additional assembly of raw reads to both the hemoglobin reference sequence  and to the associated contig  confirmed that low elevation reads were indeed absent, rather than being misassembled during the initial de novo assembly and read-mapping .

hemoglobin is a key component of oxygen storage and regulation, and plays an important role in physiological adaptation to different environments  <cit> . a host of studies have demonstrated an association of hemoglobin alpha chain haplotype frequency with elevation in mammals  <cit> . here, hemoglobin alpha chain transcripts were only detected among the high elevation sequencing reads. we sanger sequenced the hemoglobin alpha chain in our dna samples of o. princeps, revealing no variation at the nucleotide level within or among elevations . this result may be indicative of differential gene expression across elevations, with expression among the low elevation samples occurring below our detection level, even after the normalization of transcripts. additional studies are required to further elucidate the role of hemoglobin alpha chain, if any, in local adaptation of o. princeps.

gradients in latitude and elevation can been useful for predicting the impact of climate change on natural populations. for example, in the case of mountain species, low-elevation populations may possess unique genetic variation associated with adaptation to higher temperature; if present, such adaptations might provide insight into the ability of high elevation populations to adapt in response to climate change. while our study was not designed to test predictions related to climate change, we provide novel sequence data from genes expressed by o. princeps at both low and high elevations, which provides a valuable resource for future research.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first broad-scale, transcriptome-level study conducted within the ochotonidae, providing novel genomic resources to inform studies of pika ecology, behaviour, and population history, while enabling direct investigations of potential biotic responses to changing environments. we identified  <dig>  novel snps among o. princeps inhabiting different elevations. we detected snps and haplotypes that were fixed and different among elevations, and identified the nd <dig> region of the mitochondrial genome as a promising target gene for further studying the role of cellular respiration in local adaptation to varying environments. we also found contigs that were unique to each elevation, including hemoglobin alpha chain, which may represent candidate regions subject to differential gene expression along this elevation gradient. although this rnaseq approach was successful at identifying a large number of novel snp loci, information on allele frequencies was limited by the small number of individuals used in the pooled libraries. emerging protocols that utilize combinatorial labelling methods and restriction associated dna  sequencing may provide more efficient and cost-effective alternatives for simultaneously discovering snps in non-model organisms and genotyping population-level samplings.
