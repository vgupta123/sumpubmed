BACKGROUND
seventeen β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases  are crucial enzymes involved in the formation of active sex steroids by the transformation of a keto into a hydroxyl-group at position  <dig>  the best known 17β-hsd is type  <dig> 17β-hsd  that is expressed in the testis where it transforms androstenedione  into testosterone . its deficiency is the cause of the well known male pseudohermaphroditism  <cit> . this enzyme is inactive for c18-steroids. an additional enzyme able to catalyze the transformation of 4-dione into t is type  <dig> 17β-hsd  <cit> . since 17β-hsd <dig> is not expressed in the ovary while 17β-hsd <dig> is present  <cit> , and women deficient in 17β-hsd <dig> are asymptomatic  <cit> , it is likely that 17β-hsd <dig> is the enzyme responsible for the formation of active androgens in the human ovary  <cit> .

on the other hand, the most studied 17β-hsd is type  <dig> 17β-hsd, probably because it is expressed abundantly in the placenta. in fact, 17β-hsd <dig> was the first 17β-hsd to be purified  <cit> , cloned  <cit>  and crystallized  <cit> . in intact cell in culture, the enzyme catalyzes almost exclusively the transformation of estrone  into estradiol   <cit> . the abundant co-expression of this estrogenic 17β-hsd as well as aromatase in the placenta suggests that the aromatization step precedes the 17β-hsds step. this proposed mechanism is also in agreement with a higher affinity of aromatase for 4-dione than for testosterone. other 17β-hsds are known to be able to metabolize estrogens. thus types  <dig> and  <dig> 17β-hsds catalyze the formation of e <dig>  types  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 17β-hsds that preferred nad+ as cofactor are e <dig> inactivating enzymes  <cit> .

up to now, at least twelve isoforms of 17β-hsds have been identified and some members of the 17β-hsds family have been shown multifunctionality associated with cancer, metabolism diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to their roles in steroid metabolism  <cit> . most of 17β-hsds belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase reductase  superfamily except the type  <dig> 17β-hsd, which belongs to the aldo-keto reductase  superfamily. a particular property of members of 17β-hsds family is that they possess very different primary structures  despite being highly specific for substrates having closely related structures. additional regulation of 17β-hsds activity is achieved by the specificity of tissue distribution of these 17β-hsds, thus permitting each tissue to control intracellular steroid levels according to local needs. such local intracellular formation of steroids in peripheral target tissues from the adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone  has been called intracrinology  <cit> .

recently, we have found that the h17β-hsd <dig>  a homolog of type  <dig> 17β-hsd, selectively catalyzes the formation of e <dig>  <cit> . to gain more knowledge about this potentially very important enzyme, we have isolated a corresponding enzyme in the cynomolgus monkey , and characterized its substrate specificity, mrna tissue distribution and cellular localization.

RESULTS
sequence of maraca fascicularis 17β-hsd12
we have isolated a coding sequence of macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd <dig>  using macaca fascicularis liver mrna and pcr amplification. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  amino acid sequence alignment of 17β-hsd <dig> between macaca fascicularis and other species shows that the macaca fascicularis sequence possesses 95%, 82%, 81%, 78% and 66% identity with human, cow, mouse, rat, and duck, respectively. in addition, this enzyme contains the conserved signatures of sdr family members, namely the putative yxxxk active center and the modified gxxxgxl cofactor binding site.

substrate specificity of macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd12
we used the hek- <dig> cells stably expressing mf17β-hsd <dig> to determine the substrate specificity of the enzyme in intact cells in culture without addition of exogenous cofactor. as shown in fig.  <dig>  in analogy with the h17β-hsd <dig>  the mf17β-hsd <dig> catalyzes predominately the transformation of el into e <dig> while the transformation of 4-dione into t, e <dig> into el and t into 4-dione are not significant. fig.  <dig> shows that the conversion of el into e <dig> increases proportionally with the incubation, thus indicating that our incubation conditions are appropriate and that time is a limiting step even after  <dig> h of incubation.

tissue distribution of macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd12
using quantitative realtime pcr, we examined the expressions levesl and tissue distribution of 17β-hsd <dig> mrna in  <dig> macaca fascicularis tissues, namely the adrenal gland, ovary, mammary gland, endometrium, myometrium, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, liver, pancreas, heart, testis, prostate, kidney, skin, muscle and spleen. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the mf17β-hsd <dig> is ubiquitously expressed with the highest level in the spleen, adrenal gland and cerebellum, and moderate levels all the other tissues examined. macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd <dig>  which is highly and widely expressed in gonadal as well as extragonadal tissues is most probably a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of estradiol.

cell-specific distribution of macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd12
in order to obtain information about the cellular localization of 17β-hsd <dig> in estrogen-sensitive tissues, we performed in situ hybridization on the adult female macaca fascicularis mammary gland and uterus using a 35s-labeled probe. the labelling was detected on both the epithelial cells of the alveoli and the stromal cells of the mammary gland . in the uterus, the hybridization signal was seen in the epithelial cells and in the stromal cells of the endometrium . in the uterine cervix, 17β-hsd <dig> mrna was observed in the squamous epithelium and stromal cells . when the radiolabeled sense probes were used for hybridization in consecutive sections, only weak and diffuse labelling corresponding to background could be detected in the mammary gland, uterus and uterine cervix .

discussion
in this report, we have shown that macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd <dig> catalyzes selectively the transformation of el into e <dig>  similar to that has been found for the corresponding human enzyme. the present data strongly suggest that 17β-hsd <dig> is most likely the key enzyme controlling the local conversion of el  into e <dig> . it is noteworthy that el could come from both sources, the local transformation of the precursor 4-dione by aromatase or from the circulation under the form of el and el-s  <cit> . it is well recognized that most of peripheral cells possess all the necessary enzymatic machinery to transform the adrenal androgen precursors into e <dig>  <cit> . cells that possess steroid sulfatase could use the sulfated precursor dhea-s and el-s to produce e <dig> 

the mrna tissue distribution analysis performed with quantitative realtime pcr shows that the enzyme is distributed ubiquitously, thus suggesting its important role in the production of estradiol in a large number and possibly all peripheral target tissues. in contrast 17β-hsd <dig> is more selectively expressed in the placenta  <cit>  and in granulosa cells of the ovary  <cit> . the highest mrna expression levels have been found in the cerebellum and spleen suggesting that this enzyme could play an important role in these tissues. however, in the tissues where a lower mrna expression levels is observed, it could not mean that the role exerted by the enzyme is not important, but it reflects essentially the relatively fewer amount of cells expressing this enzyme compare to the total cells in the tissue.

cloning of the cdna of mf17β-hsd <dig> has allowed us to study the cellular localization of the enzyme in the mammary gland and uterus. in the mammary gland, 17β-hsd <dig> mrna expression was detected in both epithelial and stromal cells. this is in agreement with the action of estrogens in the development and proliferation of alveoli and lactogenesis in the mammary gland. in the uterus, the enzyme was found in the both epithelial cells and stromal cells of the endometrium. these results strongly suggest that 17β-hsd <dig> is directly involved in the local synthesis of e <dig> in the estrogen target tissues.

although twelve types of 17β-hsds have been identified based on their specificity to catalyze the interconversion of the 17β-ketosteroids and 17β-hydroxysteroids, and named according to the chronological order of their characterization, the true physiological role of many of these enzymes remains to be determined. for example, the phenotype of hsdl7b <dig> knockout mice is not well explained by the known activities of 17β-hsd <dig> on sex steroids  <cit> . on the other hand, 17β-hsd <dig>  which was originally identified as the estradiol-inactiving dehydrogenasse from porcine endometrium  <cit> , mainly participates in the β-oxidation of fatty acids  <cit> . accordingly, mutations of the 17β-hsd <dig> gene lead to severe developmental defects resembling zellweger syndrome  <cit> , a rare hereditary disorder affecting infants, and usually results in death associated with unusual problems in prenatal development, an enlarged liver, high levels of iron and copper in the blood, and vision disturbances. type  <dig> 17β-hsd, an enzyme observed in the rat, most probably corresponds to type  <dig> 17β-hsd in the mouse that catalyses the transformation of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol  into androsterone . the corresponding human ortholog is not yet identified. on the other hand, type  <dig> 17β-hsd is presently best characterized as a 3β-reductase involved in cholesterol metabolism  <cit> , and the role of type  <dig> 17β-hsd as an estradiol inactivating enzyme  <cit>  is still not well defined. types  <dig> and  <dig> l7β-hsds metabolize 5α-reduced steroids but their involvement in the metabolism of active steroids is unclear. type  <dig> 17β-hsd was identified as 3-ketoacyl-coa reductase, involved in long chain fatty acid elongation with a very weak activity  <cit> . recently, we have found that the h17β-hsd <dig> catalyzes selectively the formation of e <dig>  <cit> .

overall, among the twelve enzymes identified as l7β-hsds, only four are most likely working as l7β-hsds synthesizing active steroids: the types  <dig> and  <dig> l7β-hsds are involved in the transformation of c19-steroids  while types  <dig> and  <dig> are involved in the conversion of el into e <dig>  the selective activity of type  <dig> 17β-hsd for the transformation of el into e <dig> in the macaca fascicularis  as well as the high mrna expression levels of this enzyme in estrogen-sensitive tissues, including the mammary gland and uterus, strongly suggest that this enzyme is a crucial partner of aromatase in the biosynthesis of estradiol. indeed, the presence of estrogen specific 17β-hsds  catalyzing the transformation of el to e <dig> and the higher affinity of aromatase for 4-dione than for t are strongly in favor of the pathway in which 4-dione is converted into el by aromatase followed by the transformation of el into e <dig> by estrogen specific l7β-hsds. this pathway is in contrast with a generally believed pathway in which 4-dione is transformed to t by l7β-hsds followed by the aromatization of t into e <dig>  it strongly suggests that in the estradiol biosynthesis pathway, the step of 17-ketoreduction comes after the step of the aromatization . the higher affinity of aromatase for 4-androstenedione than for testosterone seems to agree with the present data.

CONCLUSIONS
these results strongly suggest that the macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd <dig> is an essential partner of aromatase in the biosynthesis of estradiol . it strongly suggests that in the estradiol biosynthesis pathway, the step of 17-ketoreduction comes after the step of the aromatization  which is in contrast with the hypothesis suggesting that 4-androstenedione is converted to testosterone followed by the aromatization of testosterone.
