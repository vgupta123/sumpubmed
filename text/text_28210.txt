BACKGROUND
the american mink  is a member of the mustelidae family in the order carnivora, an order that includes hundreds of widely distributed wild species as well as common companion animals. mink have been farmed since the mid-19th century in north america and the early 20th century in europe. the mink industry has recorded a gradual increase in production with almost  <dig> million mink pelts harvested globally in  <dig> .

as farming of mink is growing, the need to identify the genomic mechanisms for specific traits is becoming more important for breeding, management, and health care of this species. a large quantitative trait loci  project for mink, comprising more than  <dig> f <dig> animals scored for more than  <dig> traits, has recently been run as a collaborative venture between the faculty of agricultural sciences of the university of aarhus and the department of basic animal sciences of the university of copenhagen, denmark. in conjunction with the currently existing linkage maps  <cit> , our bac resource now provides a valuable tool for the mapping and characterization of traits involved in production. to identify genomic regions responsible for specific traits, with the ultimate goal of implementation into breeding and management programs, genomic large-insert libraries have been previously proven to be of crucial importance. large-insert bac libraries can be screened using gene or genetic markers to identify and map regions of interest. furthermore, large-scale mapping can utilize libraries in genome projects, and hence provide valuable data on the genome structure. to date, the focus of mink research has been on coat color genetics  <cit> , isolating microsatellite markers  <cit> , developing linkage maps  <cit> , gene and comparative mapping using zoo-fish experiments  <cit> , and somatic cell hybrids  <cit> .

in the last  <dig> years, bac libraries have been extensively used in physical mapping and complete eukaryote genome sequencing  <cit> . the utility of bac clones as substrates for end sequencing, in conjunction with advanced dna techniques and microarray analysis, has permitted construction of robust physical maps and selection of bac minimum tiling paths. recent advances in deep sequencing technologies  have created powerful opportunities in which bac libraries play an important role, as this study demonstrates. additionally, bac end sequences  not only provide a snapshot of the sequence composition of the genome of the species of interest  <cit>  but also aid in genome assembly  <cit> , chromosome walking  <cit> , creating comparative physical maps  <cit> , and identifying genetic markers  <cit> .

here, we present the availability and utility of an american mink bac library. this is the first reported neovison vison bac library; it will be an important tool for constructing physical maps and for the identification and sequencing of regions of the mink genome. as the present paper proves, these large-insert bac clones are useful for identification of regions of interest to the fur industry as well as to the fundamental science community. the quantitative characteristics, which are most often a common breeding objective, shall also be considered at the genetic level. coat color genetics in mink is the first interest targeted, as variation is common; the fur color, markings , or the patterns separate the color types. it is established that there are at least  <dig> different genes that control color types in the standard mink, counting both recessive and dominant ones  <cit> . this study is aimed at candidate genes for the most popular colors as well as some other traits, as presented in table  <dig>  it is also the first reported study of mammals in which bac clone availability in conjunction with new sequencing technologies have produced complex information in a small genome project.

RESULTS
 <dig>  library characterization
based on analysis of noti digested dna isolated from  <dig> clones, the average insert size of the chori- <dig> bac library  <cit>  was estimated to be  <dig> kb with approximately 3% false positive  clones. with a total of approximately  <dig>  clones and a mean insert size of  <dig> kb, the mink bac library collectively contains  <dig>  mb of mink dna. the size of the mink genome is unknown. however, the haploid dna content of the domestic ferret mustela putorius furo, the closest relative to the mink among species studies, is  <dig>  pg  <cit> , i.e., its genome size is approximately  <dig> mb. assuming that the genome size of the american mink is similar to that of the ferret , our bac library affords roughly  <dig> genome equivalent  of the mink genome .

 <dig>  end sequencing of bac clones. comparative mapping of mink bess to the human and dog genomes. mink genome characterization
a total of  <dig> high-quality bess were obtained from sequencing both ends of  <dig> randomly chosen 384-well plates of american mink bac clones, as well as from sequencing the t <dig> ends of the selected  <dig> clones that had been screened for genes of interest. only bess that were at least  <dig> bp long were used in the statistical and sequence composition analyses. the combined length of sequence analyzed was in excess of  <dig> mb, and included  <dig> paired-end bess . the average length of individual bess was  <dig> bp. bess were deposited in genbank .

considering the high degree of synteny between human and mink  <cit> , the existing zoo-fish data involving the dog, mink, and human  <cit> , and the relative accuracy of the reference human and dog genomes sequences, we blasted the mink bess to the human and dog genomes . of the total of  <dig> high-quality bess,  <dig>  bess gave unique hits  to the human genome and a total of  <dig>  to the dog genome. the density of the mink bess on the human genome is rather sparse , but owing to the stringent cutoff used for the comparative mapping analysis it is more accurate. the comparative blasting against the dog and human genomes revealed distances between the mink insert ends of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively. this observation supports the previous synteny data determined by zoo-fish in which the number of rearrengments between dog and mink is much greater than that between human and mink  <cit> .

overall, the bess had an average gc content of  <dig> %, which is similar to the 41% gc content of the human genome  <cit> . an internal search for the repetitive elements on bess revealed  <dig> different types of repeats of which  <dig> were carnivore specific while only  <dig>  were "mustelidae family" specific when searched against the public database. the representation of the "mustelidae" specific repeats account for roughly 2% of the analysed sequences. no american mink specific type of repeat was detected. a carnivore repeatmasker analysis on the bess revealed that 25% of the total sequence consisted of transposable elements ,  <dig> % of which were sines and  <dig> % were line elements . even when adding the 2% "mustelidae" specific elements, the proportion of repeat sequences in the mink bess is suggestively different from that found in the dog genome at 34%  <cit> . this implies that the mink genome may be smaller than the canine counterpart. the virtual, comparative map of the mink genome provides the foundation from which to construct a mapping tool for the identification of genes underlying economically important traits.

 <dig>  microsatellite analysis
a search for simple sequence repeats  in the mink bes dataset revealed  <dig> repeat sequences  found in  <dig> bess . the most frequently occurring ssrs were dimer  and tetramer , followed by monomer repeats . pentamer, trimer, and hexamer repeats were present at much lower frequencies, accounting for only 14% of the microsatellites present. the microsatellite occurrence rate in the mink genome seems to be approximately one every  <dig> kb. additionally, each assembled contig containing genes had a variable number of ssrs , which subsequently could be developed into microsatellite markers.

 <dig>  transcribed regions
after masking for tes, a megablast  comparison revealed that  <dig> of the mink bess  were similar to human proteins at an e value of <e- <dig>  an accurate estimate for the total length of the protein coding fraction in the mink genome does not currently exist. nevertheless, this small resource adds additional information to the  <dig> existing mink cdna sequences deposited at genbank  .

 <dig>  screening of the library
the chori  <dig> bac library was screened using  <dig> probes specific to known expressed sequences representing  <dig> candidate genes potentially involved in color phenotypes as well as candidates for traits involving fur coarseness, hair length, and health-related conditions in mink . most of them were created from dog and  <dig> from mink est sequences  using the "universal probes" tool set for carnivores  <cit> . these probes were hybridized to the bac filters as a single pool, and  <dig> bac clones were verified as positive for  <dig> different expression tags after t <dig> end sequencing and comparison of the sequence to the dog assembly . although we cannot accurately determine the number of positives for each individual gene as some of the bess did not provide information in relation to any gene, based on the number of clones and the observed average insert size of  <dig> kb, we estimate the library to have an approximately 10-fold genome representation.

to identify the relationships between the probes and the clones, bac t <dig> end sequencing was performed for the arrayed positive clones and blasted against the dog and human genomes. nineteen of the  <dig> genes taken into consideration  were identified by comparing the t <dig> bacs to the dog genome sequences .

 <dig>   <dig> sequencing of the clones containing genes of interest
as described in the "methods" section, two rounds of bac clones organized in pools were sequenced independently in germany  and california  by two different approaches. the obtained information varied to some extent between the two pools. thus, the germany pool had fewer gaps  in the sequences  and the sum of the contigs from clones for individual genes  averaged approximately  <dig> kb. longer parts of the clone were sequenced and the total read data summed up to  <dig> mb. statistically, this allocates approximately  <dig>  mb of sequence per gene  representing 10- to 20-fold coverage.

the california pool yielded a shorter average insert size and there were more gaps in the contig   with the sum of the contigs from clones for individual genes  averaging approximately  <dig> kb. the total read data summed up to  <dig> mb, which translates into 10- to 20-fold coverage. in this case, some sequences were found to match outside of the expected syntenic region, probably due to the inconsistencies in the dog genome assembly. the generated sequence for each locus is presented in table  <dig> 

the maximum contig spanned  <dig>  bp, but a few of the clones had contigs shorter than  <dig> bp. the quality of the  <dig> sequencing could be evaluated, as  <dig> of the genes had been sequenced both in the germany and california pools and from different clones . the results indicate that in the mlph case it is the same allele that has been sequenced, whereas the other  <dig> genes have a much higher error rate, indicating that  <dig> different alleles have been sequenced. many of the gaps coincided with single base repeats, which is a known problem with the  <dig> sequencing system. the error rate might be slightly higher, as when the blast program finds too many mismatches it can cut the query sequence into  <dig> pieces. the general assembled contigs were subsequently aligned using the dog assembly as a reference and, in most cases, the linearity of the sequence is consistent . exon/intron boundaries for each of the genes have been established using "gene finding" tools  <cit> . the analysis indicates that, in most cases, the coding sequences are entirely embedded in the contigs of the genes. additionally, sequences from  <dig> different clones could be assembled and aligned providing the information for the entire line element in the american mink .

for mlph, the assumption is that the same allele was sequenced, while for the other  <dig> genes, different alleles were compared

CONCLUSIONS
providing a publicly available redundant genomic large-insert library for the american mink was important for several reasons. first, large genomic insert clones can be used to construct contigs for regions of interest, can be fingerprinted on a large scale and thus used to create large physical maps of the mink genome, or can be used for shotgun sequencing approaches. second, the exchange of data between researchers is improved when they are utilizing the same library. the characterization reported here illustrates the usefulness of the library for identifying genomic clones and the possibility of utilizing bac clones in gene mining projects. the large average insert size of the clones combined with the high redundancy will provide researchers with the possibility of obtaining complete gene sequences within a single bac clone. this might be useful for expression studies of genes and their regulatory elements. third, the bac library of the american mink will be an important tool for future mustelides projects and to the fur industry. this information can be used to improve breeding and management programs, leading to increased profitability for the industry through the provision of basic data that will be usable in schemes for selecting desirable traits. the utility of the library also resides in the possibility of targeted sequencing of the gene-specific, selected clones by means of the new deep sequencing technology. this has already been implemented for  <dig> genes selected from this library and, when completed, the results will be communicated in later reports.

to our knowledge this is the first targeted  <dig> sequencing from clones containing genes of interest in mammals and proves to be accurate and useful in the context of a small animal genetics project. considering the high degree of synteny between the existing zoo-fish data derived from the dog, mink, and human  <cit>  and the relative accuracy and linearity of the reference dog genome sequences  <cit> , the mink bacs were blasted against the dog genome; the dog is the closest relative to the mink and therefore its genome was utilized in the assembly of the clones . the dog genome assembly can be used as a reference in relation to the mink sequence but caveats apply as there are some inconsistencies due either to the old zoo-fish inconsistencies for small segments of the genome or to the errors in the dog genome assembly  <cit> .

we have constructed a high-quality  <dig> × bac library for neovison vison and demonstrated the utility of the library as a genetic tool. further screenings of the library with other genes of interest involving traits important for the fur industry are under way. this will facilitate further research in the field of skin and fur physiology and function.
