BACKGROUND
recent advances in dna microarray technologies have made it possible to investigate the transcriptional portion of gene networks in a variety of organisms. when microarray experiments are performed to monitor gene expression over time, researchers can address questions concerning the detection of the cellular processes underlying the observed regulatory effects, inference of regulatory networks and, ultimately, assignment of functions to the genes analyzed in the time courses.

there is a natural connection between gene function and gene expression. based on our understanding of cellular processes, genes that are contained in a particular pathway, or respond to a common internal or external stimulus, should be co-regulated and consequently, should show similar patterns of expression. therefore, identifying patterns of gene expression and grouping genes into expression classes may provide much greater insight into their biological functions. a large group of statistical methods, generally referred to as "cluster analysis", have been developed to identify genes that behave similarly across a range of experimental conditions, including time courses. these statistical algorithms can be divided into two classes, depending on whether they are based on 'similarity' measures or not. methods based on 'similarity' measures rely on defining a distance  between gene expression vectors; euclidean distance and/or the pearson correlation coefficient are the two most commonly used distance measures. examples of similarity measures-based methods are hierarchical clustering  <cit> , k-means  <cit> , self-organization maps   <cit> , and support vector machine   <cit> . these methods do not consider the temporal structure of the data when used to analyze time-course experiments. in addition, some methods could confuse the clusters because the actual expression patterns of the genes themselves become less relevant as clusters grow in size  <cit> .

the clustering methods in the second class are based on statistical models, without defining a 'similarity' measure. using statistical models to represent clusters changes the question from how close two data points are to how likely a given data point is under the model. such clustering methods are more commonly used to analyze time-course microarray experiments. examples of such methods are based on cubic spline  <cit> , anova model  <cit> , autoregressive curves  <cit> , first-order kinetics  <cit> , hidden markov models  <cit> , bayesian model average  <cit> , order-restricted inference methodology  <cit> , and gaussian mixture models  <cit> . such approaches may be restricted either by the rigorous assumptions of the stochastic models  <cit> , or by the small number of time points and non-uniform sampling intervals in gene expression data  <cit> .

in gene networks, the level of expression of individual genes changes based on their functional position in the network. therefore, the most critical information in time course expression profiles is the timing of the changes in expression level for each gene  <cit> , and secondarily is the general shape of its expression pattern  <cit> . in addition, different genes will be activated or inactivated at each level of a gene network. therefore it may not be reasonable to expect that the expression levels of those co-expressed genes will go up and down concordantly all the way through the entire sampling period. with the same timing of initial change, genes which share similar pattern of expression for any number of sampling intervals from the beginning should be considered co-expressed at certain level in the gene network. however, statistical methods to analyze these patterns have not yet been reported.

attention to the multiplicity problem in gene expression analysis has been increasing. numerous methods are available for controlling the family-wise type i error rate . since microarray experiments are frequently exploratory in nature and the sample sizes are usually small, benjamini and hochberg  <cit>  suggested a potentially more powerful procedure, the false discovery rate , to control the expected proportion of errors among the identified differentially expressed genes. a number of studies for controlling fdr have followed  <cit> . in microarray experiments with multi-level treatments, the multiple testing problems are two dimensional. not only are thousands of genes involved, but for each gene, either pre-selected contrasts or post-hoc comparisons may be needed to characterize its expression pattern. there are very few studies that have investigated how to deal with such multiple-testing problems in the microarray literature  <cit> .

in this manuscript, we propose a different strategy based on planned linear contrasts  for the analysis of time-course microarray experiments. specifically, our approach takes into consideration the temporal order in the data, including the timing of a gene's initial response and the general shapes of gene expression patterns along the subsequent sampling time points. our methods are particularly suitable for analysis of microarray experiments in which it is often difficult to take sufficiently frequent measurements and/or the sampling intervals are non-uniform. we demonstrated our method on the analysis of microarray data from murine olfactory sensory epithelia at five different time points after target ablation.

RESULTS
olfactory sensory neurons  detect odors in the ambient environment and transmit the sensory information directly to the brain. the death of osns can be induced experimentally by microsurgical removal of their axonal targets in the brain . the temporal regulation of genes associated with the death of osns and other cellular processes as a result of obx can be systematically investigated at  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post-obx. based on the statistical methods described ,  <dig> genes were considered to be significant by the procedure of controlling fdr at 5% for multiple testing across genes. the largest p-value considered to be significant was  <dig>  as determined by the fdr procedure. the temporal regulation of these  <dig> genes fell into four distinct classes based on the first significant change in their temporal profile that occurred at either  <dig> hr ,  <dig> hr ,  <dig> hr , or  <dig> hr  post-obx. among the  <dig> genes ,  <dig> were grouped into class i in which the differential expression of these genes was detected as early as  <dig> hours after target ablation. seventy-six genes were grouped into class ii,  <dig> genes whose expression level first changed at  <dig> hr post-obx into class iii, and  <dig> genes whose expression level first changed at  <dig> hours after the surgery were grouped into class iv. the remaining  <dig> genes did not pass our selection criteria although their anova f tests were significant.

the expression level of the gene for olfactory marker protein omp, which is expressed in mature osns, was unchanged at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr following obx. the initial change, a down-regulation at  <dig> hr post-obx, indicated that degeneration was evident between  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post-obx . the significant down-regulation of omp  continued to the  <dig> hr time-point that was accompanied by a - <dig>  fc in omp mrna, indicating degenerative changes in osns accompanying their cell death.

the genes for programmed cell death  <dig> , centrin  <dig> , and kit are examples of class i genes that showed their first significant change in temporal expression at  <dig> hr post-obx, with pdcd <dig> and cetn <dig> being up-regulated and kit being down-regulated . in contrast, class ii genes showed their first significant change in temporal expression at  <dig> hr post-obx ; they included the genes for chemokine  ligand  <dig> , colony stimulating factor  <dig> , and budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles  <dig> homolog  that were up-regulated simultaneously. the genes for phosphatidylserine synthase  <dig>  and the transferrin receptor  are examples of class iii genes that showed their first significant change in temporal expression at  <dig> hr post-obx, with ptdss <dig> and tfrc down-regulated and up-regulated respectively . the genes identified statistically as class iv genes were initially quiescent until their first significant change in expression at  <dig> hr post-obx  as shown by the genes for caspase  <dig> , cd <dig> antigen , and schlafen  <dig> . from a functional perspective, the regulation of the genes for pdcd <dig>  ptdss <dig>  and casp <dig> at  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr, and  <dig> hr respectively suggested that the molecular mechanisms associated with osn degeneration and cell death occurred over a 2d time frame that is consistent with the systematic down-regulation of the gene for omp. the up-regulation of the genes for ccl <dig> and cd <dig> at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr respectively suggested the expression of macrophage chemoattractant protein- <dig>  by resident and recruited macrophages identified phenotypically with cd <dig> antibody that indicate the delivery of bioactive molecules associated with the earliest regeneration of the sensory epithelium. the genes for kit, csf <dig>  bub <dig>  and slfn <dig> are broadly defined as having growth factor activity, which suggested that molecular mechanisms associated with the transformation of progenitor cells into mature osns through the proliferative stages of the cell cycle was initiated within  <dig> hr of obx and continued throughout the following  <dig> hr. the results of our statistical and bioinformatics analyses clearly indicate that the categorization of genes into four classes based on their first significant temporal regulatory event has biological relevance at the cellular level in this neurosensory tissue.

genes in each class share the same timing of their earliest significant change in expression. the expression pattern of each gene at subsequent time points may vary. we therefore can further cluster genes in each class into subgroups based on their subsequent expression patterns or 'fluctuation patterns'. for genes in class i , there theoretically may as many as  <dig> fluctuation patterns. in our example study, we found  <dig> different patterns in this class. there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> patterns for genes in class ii, iii, and iv respectively. we can use simple diagrams to illustrate these patterns and a series of characters  to index their expression patterns as described in the methods. for example, the fluctuation pattern of omp expression  can be represented by , and the expression of pdcd <dig> can be indicated by  . genes with the same fluctuation patterns will be finally grouped into the same group . for example, gene cetn <dig> and cetn <dig> shared the same expression pattern and can be grouped together. this pattern was indicated by . genes csf <dig> and pdcd <dig> had their initial responses at hr <dig> and shared the same fluctuation pattern. these two genes can be classified into another group indicated as . genes cd <dig> and slfn <dig>  can also form a cluster for the same reason.

discussion
in this study, we adopted linear models to describe our data and used planned linear contrasts to analyze time-course microarray experiments. we identified  <dig> genes with significant changes in expression in a microarray study of murine olfactory epithelium, and  <dig> of them were grouped into  <dig> classes based on the timing of their initial changes. we further categorized these  <dig> genes into  <dig> fluctuation patterns. we also used simple diagrams to illustrate these fluctuation patterns and a series of characters  to index these patterns. although the anova f tests were significant,  <dig> genes cannot be grouped into any of these  <dig> classes based on our criteria. a significant anova f test among a group of means indicates that the largest contrast among all possible contrasts is significant. therefore, a gene with a significant f test does not necessarily have a significant selected contrast. therefore the expression patterns of these genes should be interpreted carefully.

our methods emphasized the relative differences between adjacent sampling time points and the direction of the differences. the information about exact magnitudes of gene expressed at each time point was not included in our methods. for example, two genes may have the same pattern index  <dig>  <dig> - <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  but the magnitude of changes for the two genes may be dramatically different. therefore, even for genes in the same index groups, their expression patterns should be examined with care.

the temporal order in the data was considered in our methods by the selection sequence but was not parameterized in our model. the information about the differences among sampling intervals were also ignored in our analysis. with small sample sizes and non-uniform sampling intervals, which are very common in biomedical research, our methods may be more straightforward and robust than those commonly in use. with large sample sizes and relative uniform sampling intervals, other methods, such as regression analysis, mixture models, or autoregressive models can be applied.

CONCLUSIONS
linear models were adopted to describe microarray data, and sequences of planned linear contrasts were used to group genes into different expression patterns based on their initial and subsequent changes in expression. our methods are particularly suitable for analysis of microarray experiments in which it is often difficult to take sufficiently frequent measurements and/or the sampling intervals are non-uniform. our methods can also be extended to designs with more than one factor.
