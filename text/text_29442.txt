BACKGROUND
the climate envelope paradigm   <cit>  is often criticised as a simplistic approach in modelling species distributions as it systematically excludes the influence of biotic factors on species distributions  <cit> . the inherent difficulty in precisely defining the factors determining the distribution range of a species can be particularly misleading when predicting shifts in the species range as a response to climate change  <cit> . nonetheless, the fine resolution of the factors affecting successful reproduction and dispersal abilities is essential for predicting the effects of environmental change on species distribution  <cit> . for arctic species strongly dependant on the number of degree days to successfully complete their life cycle, factors such as length of summer, temperature, timing of snow melt, snow thickness and overwintering conditions  <cit>  are all likely to influence species presence or absence. surface ice layer thickness has also been shown to have a deleterious effect on soil invertebrate populations  <cit> .

depth of snow, and hence date of snow clearance and length of the summer period, is intuitively important in determining species occurrence. for many species, especially holocyclic species, the date of snow clearance may be critical. however, few studies have investigated this point with the exception of the research by strathdee & bale  <cit>  on the svalbard endemic aphid acyrthosiphon svalbardicum , and studies regarding snow bed plant communities  <cit> . climate predictions point to an increase in winter snowfall combined with increased winter snow evaporation, leading to as yet uncertain changes in the timing of the snow melt  <cit> . in the case of a. svalbardicum, knowledge of the environmental factors controlling its biology and distribution is key to better understand the abilities of the species to track its ecological niche in changing times  <cit> . predicting species distribution response to environmental changes can stand as a major challenge if complex relations are to be modelled. for instance, plant phenology can also be considered among the same environmental factors that affect aphid distribution as temperature, snow thickness  <cit>  summer length, or timing of snow melt  <cit> . hence identifying the direct effect of a single isolated environmental variable can be a challenging task. specialist phytophagous species often show a strong phenological synchronization with host plant  <cit> . furthermore, host plant distribution, growth and phenology can be directly influenced by temperature. for example low summer temperature limit seed setting in the high arctic  <cit> , vegetative growth and germination are positively affected by warming, and peak flowering can be brought forward by increasing temperatures  <cit> .

acyrthosiphon svalbardicum is host specific to dryas octopetala l. ssp octopetala . however, the distribution of the aphid is more restricted than the distribution of the host plant, that is, not all patches of d. octopetala harbour aphids. notable studies regarding the environmental factors effecting aphid distribution in kongsfjord  were carried out during the early 1990's  <cit> , concluding that the aphid was restricted to those areas which clear up from snow earlier in the season and where the aphid will experience the minimum number of degree days required to complete its annual life cycle  <cit> . this simplistic hypothesis, the direct relation between snow depth and the aphid distribution, was rapidly entrenched in polar science, becoming a modern axiom in arctic ecology, even though the field study was constrained to six d. octopetala patches in a  <dig>  by  <dig>  m south facing plot in a single location within the settlement of ny-Ålesund  <cit> . verification regarding the representativeness of that patch on the species range is lacking, even though the likelihood of misestimating the effect of unusual events is recognized to increase with the reduction on the scale of the study  <cit> . in fact, later studies in the southern location of endalen  have showed the aphid to be more abundant than expected under deep snow profiles  <cit> . consequently, whether snow depth, and hence timing of snow clearance, has a role in determining the local limit of the distribution of the aphid yet remains unclear.

acyrthosiphon svalbardicum is locally abundant on coastal ridges along the south coast of kongsfjord, where its occurrence has been described as decreasing towards the entrance of the fjord and with distance from the shore  <cit> , even though the host plant is ubiquitous in the area. this species is thought to have low dispersal abilities since the production of alate forms appears to be rare  <cit> . this has led to the hypothesis that this species may not be able to rapidly track suitable environmental conditions but that it is restrained to those few consistently microclimatically favourable sites  <cit> . acyrthosiphon svalbardicum is a holocyclic species that overwinters as an egg, and the complex life cycle includes four morphs . the fundatrix gives rise directly to both sexual morphs and a viviparous form. the viviparae produces an additional generation of sexual morphs which often fails to give rise successful offspring, but which should it succeed, will increase the number of overwintering eggs by  <dig> fold  <cit> . the production of alate forms of the aphid has been rarely reported, and this event is thought to be related to unusually long or warm summers  <cit> . all the life stages of the aphid occur on d. octopetala, where it is more common on shoots with seed heads or flower buds than on vegetative shoots. the eggs are often found on the underside of the leaves  <cit> .

set against this background, we aimed to: 1) assess the relationship between snow depth and the distribution of a. svalbardicum; 2) survey for changes in the local range since 1995; and 3) combine field data on ice and snow depth, timing of snow melt, patch occupancy, aphid phenology and host plant phenology to determine possible relationships between these environmental variables and the distribution of the aphid at landscape scale. moreover, we aimed to generate a baseline distribution and environmental map available for future studies both regarding snow depth and species distribution.

RESULTS
snow depth and the timing of snow clearance
a clear increase in temperature fluctuations indicating timing of snow melt was recorded by all temperature loggers . the temperature data revealed a linear relation between snow depth and timing of snow melt on south facing slopes , although the relation varied slightly between  <dig>   and  <dig>  . there was no significant relationship for north facing slopes  in  <dig> . additionally, the relationship slightly weakens when multiyear data from south facing slopes is pooled together  . the earliest melting date recorded was 5th may  <dig> for areas with <  <dig> cm of snow in april, and the latest melting date recorded was 30th june  <dig> for areas with  <dig> cm of snow in april.

snow depth data showed a strong inter-annual within-site variation. snow depth at some sites in  <dig> was up to  <dig> cm thicker than in  <dig> . the surface ice layer also showed a strong variation. in  <dig>  the surface ice layer measured on snow-free patches was up to  <dig> cm thick, but disappeared when snow depths reached  <dig> cm or deeper. however, in  <dig> the surface ice layer was considerably thicker, varying from  <dig> cm in snow free areas to  <dig> cm under  <dig> cm of snow.

the minimum soil temperature recorded reached - <dig> °c .

aphid phenology
a significant relation was found between aphid phenology and snow depth , but not between aphid phenology and host plant phenology . although aphids were found mostly on those patches with the most advanced phenological stage, the eggs were found almost equally on plant stages  <dig> and  <dig> . eggs were present mostly on those areas showing shallower snow depths in winter, while viviparae and oviparae forms were found at a range of depths. fertilized eggs  were observed on  <dig> occasions confirming successful reproduction. viviparae forms were scored  <dig> times while oviparae and males were scored in  <dig> occasions.

. the number of patches occupied is given as absolute figure in relation to the  <dig> patches surveyed, and as a percentage of the total number of patches with the given phenology that are occupied by the aphid. additionally the percentage of each aphid life stage  scored at each plant phenological stage is presented.

host plant phenology
host plant phenology was examined in august  <dig> in  <dig> patches of d. octopetala,  <dig> patches still bore flowers, while a total of  <dig> patches showed seed heads in other developmental stages. in august  <dig>   <dig> patches had no visible seed or flower bud. the most common phenological stage at that time of the year was stage  <dig>  with  <dig> patches of d. octopetala at this stage . host plant phenology showed no relationship with orientation of the patches  . however, a significant relationship between snow depth and plant phenology was found , and the earlier phenological stages were found on areas with deeper snow profiles in winter.

patch occupancy and aphid distribution range
from  <dig> points analysed in  <dig>   <dig> represented a patch of the d. octopetala, and  <dig> of those were occupied by the a. svalbardicum.

from the  <dig> d. octopetala patches re-visited in  <dig>   <dig> patches occupied in  <dig> were now empty and  <dig> of the empty ones were re-colonized in  <dig>  the occurrence of the aphid was confirmed at the end points surveyed by strathdee et al.  <cit> .

distribution of the aphid on the host with relation to snow depth and host phenology
snow depth, site occupancy and plant phenology were mapped for both ridges . detailed snow depths and species distributions were combined to determine the maximum snow depth where the aphids occurred in  <dig>  the aphid was present at snow depths of up to  <dig> cm for plants in the most advanced phenology  and  <dig> cm for less advanced host plant phenological stages. no aphids  were found in d. octopetala patches on early phenological stages   . overall, the aphid was restricted to those patches at phenological stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  just 8% of d. octopetala patches at stage  <dig> were occupied by the aphid but the percentage of occupied patches increased to 35% and 67% for stages  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . a binomial linear model showed a significant relationship between snow depth and site occupancy  and host plant phenology and site occupancy . significant differences were shown between the snow depth measured for occupied  and un-occupied  patches for each host plant phenological stage  . a dunn's post- hoc for pairwise differences revealed no significant differences in snow depth measured for occupied  and un-occupied  patches for each host plant phenological stage . significant differences were found, however, between snow depths measured at patches in the earlier phenological stage , and patches at the later phenological stages: 4a, 4p  and 5p   .

discussion
species distribution modelling is a fast advancing field  <cit> , with applications that reach from population monitoring  <cit> , assessing climate driven species range shift  <cit> , conservation biology  <cit> , to testing biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary hypotheses  <cit> . it is often possible to predict a link between climate and species distributions  <cit> , although the application of climate envelope paradigms in the modelling of species distributions have repeatedly raised the need to include a range of factors/tolerances beyond only climatic variables  <cit> . in the case of the svalbard endemic aphid a. svalbardicum, a high arctic species strongly dependant on number of degree days to successfully complete its life cycle, summer temperature and length of the growing season are thought to be limiting factors governing the distribution of the species  <cit> . previous studies indicated snow depth as an accurate predictor of a. svalbardicum distribution  <cit> , indicating that the aphid succeeds in reproduction, and thus is commonly present, in those patches with snow clearance early in the season and where the aphid would experience at least the minimum number of degree days required to complete its life cycle. in our study we compared multiple transects over a series of ridges and did observe at a larger scale the predictions made by strathdee & bale  <cit> . eggs were found in those patches that showed shallower snow depths in winter, although the aphid was more widely distributed across areas that showed a range of snow depths. our study also shows a statistically significant relationship between plant phenology and site occupancy that was previously overlooked, and also between plant phenology and snow depth leading to a much more complex picture. due to strong correlation between all measured variables, neither this study, nor the previous, can infer causality between snow depth and the aphid distribution. although the prediction by strathdee & bale  <cit>  fits almost perfectly along a particular transect  , the relationship cannot be generalized for the species range across the coastal ridges in kongsfjord. this was also the case for the distribution of the aphid in endalen  along a natural snow depth transect, where dollery et al.  <cit>  found a relationship between snow depth and the aphid distribution, demonstrating that shallow snow depths favour high aphid densities but while a thick winter snow pack does not preclude aphid presence. our survey also reveals a number of cases where the species would be predicted to occur based on the strathdee & bale  <cit>  hypothesis but where it does not actually occur . our results show a greater number of suitable  patches unoccupied by the aphid than occupied. they also show site occupancy at a range of snow depths and a strong relationship between site occupancy and the phenology of the host plant.

specialist phytophagous species sometimes rely on plant secondary metabolites as sign of stimuli during host selection, setting and parturition  <cit> . synchronization with the host plant is often essential for neonate success after hatching  <cit> . phenological synchronization between phytophagous species and their host plants is a common phenomenon  <cit> , as in the case of the arctic aphid sitobion calvulus ossiannilson,  <dig>  whose life cycle appears to be closely synchronized  with its host plant salix polaris  <cit> . the phenology of d. octopetala nonetheless can suffer shifts even within one season due to changes in snow accumulation  <cit> . in our study the aphid was found mostly in patches showing an advanced phenology, independently from the snow depth they experienced the previous winter. however, even a combination of snow depth  and plant phenology  cannot predict real site occupancy at a landscape scale . strathdee & bale  <cit>  used a probabilistic approach, which although gave an insight on environmental factors affecting species distribution, cannot be used to model accurately the actual distribution range of the species. the significance of the relationship between aphid presence and plant phenology however should be interpreted with some caution due to the skew of the plant phenotype data resulting from low sample sizes from early phenological stages.

how environmental factors affect species biology, from physiology to biogeography, is also often simplified by a pragmatically reduced knowledge on functioning and dynamic of the physical environment. even though within the same year and aspect  there is evidence of a direct relationship between snow depth and timing of snow melt, this relationship weakens when the inter-annual data are considered and disappeared completely for north facing slopes. snow depth cannot therefore be considered as a distribution predictor on north facing slopes because of the lack of any relationship between snow depth and the timing of snow melt. variation in the timing of snow melt can be as blunt as the difference between the  <dig> cm of snow that melted 12th of june  <dig> and the  <dig> cm of snow that melted with just  <dig> days difference  a year later; emphasizing the need for fully replicated multi-year studies and the difficulty involved in resolving cause and effect relationships.

our data cannot yet explain why there are un-occupied patches even at shallow snow depths and possessing a suitable phenological stage. even if aphid presence was overlooked in very low density patches that would also imply very low density patches are occurring at putative ideal patches. inter-annual variations in snow depth, ice thickness, length of summer, plant phenology and predation pressure, together with the limited dispersal ability of the aphid might be to a certain extent driving the dynamics of a metapopulation, in which not always all suitable patches are colonized, and colonization of suboptimal habitat can occur  <cit> . acyrthosiphon svalbardicum overwinters as an egg, which has been demonstrated to survive down to -30°c  <cit> . the lowest temperature recorded in the soil , is greater than the recorded lower lethal temperature for the aphid in its overwintering stage. the effects of winter ground ice cover on egg hatching success has never been measured, although it has been demonstrated to reduce soil microarthropod community populations by up to 50%, and it has been suggested to have significant implications for the usually patchy distribution of these animals  <cit> . between november  <dig> to april  <dig> svalbard airport weather station recorded  <dig>  mm  of precipitation and  <dig> winter warm spells  comprising a total of  <dig> days when the winter air temperatures rose above 0°c. in the same period the following year,  <dig>  mm of precipitation were registered , and  <dig> warm spells comprising  <dig> days in total  <cit> . this could have had an effect on eggs survival during 2009/ <dig> winter. moreover it should be recognised that the snow pack is not a homogeneous column. ice layers within the snow profile created by winter melt events, often including rain, are frequently present. hence the passage of melt water through the snow pack is not uniform  <cit>  and a combination of snow thickness and route of percolation of liquid phase water through the snow pack will influence the development of potential surface ice layers. such surface ice layers are known to reduce the overwintering survival of oribatid mites and collembola  <cit>  and may have an effect on the hatching success of overwintering eggs. nonetheless, these eggs appear to be very cold hardy  <cit>  although duration of exposure to low temperature or the effect of icing was not assessed. hence it is important to be aware that snow depth may have many additional effects that are correlated. such variations in the characteristics of the snow pack may explain why snow depth in itself fails to predict accurately the distribution of the aphid.

freeze-thaw cycles in early spring may challenge the soil invertebrate fauna, especially in alpine or sub-arctic regions  <cit> . while it is known that surface freezing events can occur throughout the year  <cit> , freeze-thaw cycles following snow clearance are less likely to occur in the high arctic. date of snow clearance is typically mid-june. at this date there has been midnight sun for over six weeks reducing soil diurnal temperature variation. as an example, in adventfjord close to longyearbyen the mean air temperature in june  <dig> was  <dig> °c  <cit>  but the soil temperature at  <dig> mm depth only first became positive from 7th june. by june 11th, soil temperature had attained 5°c with maximum temperatures over 13°c occurring during the month. no after melting soil freeze-thaw events were observed . whilst we cannot exclude the possible effect of freeze-thaw cycles on egg and fundatrix survival it would appear that such events are probably not a major factor.

snow depth has been shown to have a strong inter-annual variability due to factors such as wind direction, precipitation and temperature.  <dig> was an unusual winter with heavy snow falls followed by strong repeated thawing events which resulted in a lesser overall snow accumulation and a thick ice layer underneath the snowpack. even though  <dig> was an unusual winter, these extremes are likely to be periodically experienced by the aphid population. in the case of a species with low dispersal ability such extreme events are likely to strongly influence distribution limits. dispersal abilities of the aphid however could have also been underestimated. the species was previously hypothesized to be unable to rapidly track suitable environmental conditions and to be restrained to those few consistently microclimatically favourable sites  <cit> . however, the aphid was scored in  <dig> in patches that were empty in  <dig> and vice versa, which could indicate colonization and extinction events. moreover, the aphid range has expanded since  <dig>  whereas presence of the aphid was confirmed in the inner part of the fjord at the corbel station in  <dig>  the newly recorded presence of the aphid on coastal ridge on stuphallet  accounts for an increase in the distribution range by up to  <dig>  km from the distribution described in kongsfjord, when the outermost location where the aphid was found was brandalpynten, adjacent to ny-Ålesund . therefore, the possibility of local movement of aphids between suitable patches within a growing season is not to be underestimated. this observation agrees with previous studies on host-specific insect herbivores which indicated that species that show a restricted distribution within one host plant species may respond to environmental changes faster than the host plant itself  <cit> . furthermore, alate occurrence in a. svalbardicum could strongly influence the dispersal abilities of the species, and potentially modify the distribution of the species over a short time. the aphid has been demonstrated to respond rapidly, within days, to increased summer temperatures  <cit>  showing up to a 20-fold increase in population density in response to warming  <cit> . this positive effect on population density may, however, have an upper limit as the optimum temperature is exceeded, or increasing the density of predators and parasitoids  <cit> . lack of density data within this survey however prevents analyzing the data in terms of population size and aphid density per patch. hullé et al.  <cit>  pointed out that during the period between 1992- <dig> the summer thermal budget for the species has increased by  <dig> degree days, sufficient to produce the increase in egg production predicted by strathdee et al.  <cit> . field validation nonetheless, did not confirm this hypothesis as the extra generation was not found in a series of expected years  <cit> . summer thermal budgets  for the aphid using the temperature logger data were not calculated since the logger sensor probes were not shielded from incoming solar radiation once the snow had cleared. once the sensors were exposed to short wave radiation it is the response of the individual sensor to the incoming short wave radiation that is recorded. therefore the temperatures recorded by the logger after snow melt are not representative of the microhabitat temperatures experienced by the aphid. however, an increase in the summer thermal budget, or the increase of temperature on the appropriate time of the season for the aphid development, could to an extent explain why the species was found in more patches under deep snow profiles than expected, but once again this would not explain the absence of the species in suitable patches.

CONCLUSIONS
snow depth can be used as a proxy for timing of snow melt in kongsfjord for south facing slopes . moreover, a significant relationship between the presence of a. svalbardicum and winter snow depth was found, and consequently snow depth can be used as a predictor of the local distribution of the aphid. this is however just a coarse approximation. strong inter-annual variation in snow depth  and correlation of snow depth with other variables such as plant phenology prevents finely predicting which patches will be occupied by the aphid. the relationships described here cannot define species distribution at landscape scale , given that they do not explain un-occupancy of patches under shallow snow depths with advance phenology . the dispersal ability of the species might have been underestimated in the past, since the distribution range of the species has shown an expansion of  <dig>  km towards the fjord mouth from  <dig>  variables able to accurately predict species distribution are difficult to define yet are important to understand, especially if projections of responses to climate change are to be modelled.
