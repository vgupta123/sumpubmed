BACKGROUND
water deficit is a major environmental factor limiting plant fitness and productivity  <cit> . with patterns of global climate change likely to increase the severity of drought stresses in the future  <cit> , the development of crop plants better adapted to water-limited environments is a priority for sustainable agriculture.

plants have evolved unique mechanisms to monitor water availability in their environment and adapt to it  <cit> . in response to mild water deficits, low cellular water potential can be avoided by balancing water uptake and loss through stomatal closure, increased cuticle thickness and enhanced root growth. should these adaptations be insufficient to restore physiological water potential within the cell, more dramatic measures may be deployed. these are generally distinguished as dehydration avoidance, dehydration tolerance and drought escape  <cit> , although all three responses are highly integrated  <cit> . a key aspect of dehydration avoidance is the accumulation of compatible solutes , including sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids and organic acids, that increase cellular osmotic potential, prevent water loss and maintain turgor  <cit> . dehydration tolerance consists of measures to protect cell constituents from damage and entails the production of antioxidants and chaperones, such as dehydrins and late-embryogenesis abundant  proteins  <cit> .

the plant hormone abscisic acid  plays a pivotal role in coordinating multiple aspects of adaptation to drought stress  <cit> . stomatal closure, the accumulation of osmolytes and the synthesis of protective proteins are all correlated with drought-induced increases in endogenous aba levels. mutants defective in aba synthesis or perception are more susceptible to drought, while treatment with exogenous aba enhances drought tolerance and induces the expression of numerous dehydration-stress responsive genes and proteins. however, several dehydration stress-induced genes do not respond to exogenous application of aba in arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> , suggesting the existence of both aba-dependent and -independent signal transduction pathways.

physiological and biochemical aspects of drought adaptation are underpinned by extensive transcriptional re-programming  <cit> . drought-induced transcriptomes from several plant species have been reported  and reveal profound changes in numerous processes, including growth, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, protection against oxidative stress, phosphorylation, membrane transport, secretion, cell wall expansion, and hormone homeostasis  <cit> . functional characterization efforts have identified the role of a number of drought-induced transcripts, including many transcription factors, in driving adaptive responses  <cit> . differential gene expression in response to abiotic stress is likely associated with changes in chromatin conformation, such as those mediated by histone tail modifications and chromatin remodeling complexes  <cit> . identification and characterization of the factors and mechanisms involved is only now being elucidated and an active area of research.

one group of proteins that may be implicated in regulating plant chromatin conformation is the high-level expression of sugar-inducible gene <dig>  clade of b <dig> domain proteins. the b <dig> domain is a plant-specific basic dna-binding domain originally identified as the third and c-terminus proximal basic domain of the transcription factor absicic acid insensitive <dig>  . there are three members of the hsi <dig> clade in arabidopsis; hsi <dig>  also known as the viviparous abi3-like <dig> , hsi2-like <dig>  and hsi2-like <dig>   <cit> . additional features shared by hsi <dig> clade proteins include the cw domain and ear motif. hsi <dig> and hsl <dig> also contain a putative plant homeodomain -like zinc finger domain absent from hsl <dig>  the cw and phd-like domains are associated with chromatin remodelling factors, while the ear motif is a transcriptional repression domain. functional analysis of hsi <dig> has demonstrated that the protein is a potent ear-dependent transcriptional repressor  <cit>  and can repress abi3-mediated transactivation from the sph/ry element, the cognate dna binding site of b <dig> domain factors  <cit> . loss-of-function mutations in hsi <dig> result in the expression of seed storage proteins in vegetative tissues  <cit> . the deregulation of embryonic and seed maturation programs in vegetative tissues is more dramatic in hsi <dig> hsl <dig>  double mutants, which produce callus and ectopic embryo-like structures when seedlings are cultured in the presence of sucrose. among genes highly expressed in the double mutant seedlings are abi <dig>  fusca <dig>  and leafy cotyledon <dig> , which encode key regulators of seed maturation and constitute the afl  clade of b <dig> domain proteins. it has been proposed that hsi <dig> clade proteins suppress the seed maturation program following germination by repressing the transcription of afl clade genes and/or competing with the encoded transcription factors for sph/ry sites in the promoter of target genes  <cit> .

the recent analysis of the hsi2- <dig> allele, which creates a cysteine to tyrosine substitution in the phd domain, revealed a potential role for this hsi <dig> domain in the repression of a subset of seed-specific genes during seedling development and in the deposition of the repressive chromatin mark h3k27m <dig> on target genes  <cit> . interestingly, hsi2- <dig> hsl double mutants were morphologically normal, indicating a unique function for the hsi <dig> phd domain.

molecular genetic analysis of the hsi <dig> clade has focused on hsi <dig> hsl <dig> double mutants at the seedling stage. the potential role of these factors at other times in the plant life cycle remains largely unexplored, despite the fact that hsi <dig> and hsl <dig> are expressed in many tissues  <cit> . a cursory analysis of gene ontology  annotation terms enriched in the list of genes differentially expressed in hsi <dig> and hsi <dig> hsl <dig> mutants  <cit>  identified response to abiotic stimulus as highly significant . this prompted us to test whether hsi <dig> might regulate drought tolerance during the vegetative stage of the plant life cycle. through loss- and gain-of-function analyses, hsi <dig> is shown to act as a negative regulator of drought tolerance in arabidopsis, possibly through a mechanism involving reduced transpirational water loss.

RESULTS
to investigate the role of hsi <dig> in modulating drought responses, the levels and/or integrity of the gene were stably altered in transgenic arabidopsis plants. for loss-of-function analysis, two t-dna insertion alleles were identified . both mutant alleles show minimal expression of hsi <dig> when compared to corresponding wild-types, col- <dig> for hsi2- <dig> and col- <dig> for hsi2- <dig> . for gain-of-function analysis, the hsi <dig> coding region was placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter  and used to generate transgenic plants in col- <dig> . three independent lines showing increased levels of hsi <dig> transcripts  were further studied.

disruption of hsi <dig> by t-dna insertions confers better drought tolerance
the response of hsi <dig> mutants to drought was examined by subjecting plants to a simulated drought stress regime in environmentally controlled growth chambers. to minimize sources of variation attributed to the amount, and the initial moisture content, of the soil in pots, wild-type and corresponding mutant plants were grown side-by-side in the same containers. both hsi <dig> mutants displayed reduced rates of wilting after withholding water, by as much as 9%, compared to their wild-type counterparts . the hsi <dig> mutants also maintained higher cellular water levels, by as much as 30%, measured as leaf relative water content . additional experiments using different pot sizes and potting mixes yielded similar findings . these results indicate that hsi <dig> mutants have increased tolerance to drought, due at least in part to a reduced rate of water loss from leaves.

hsi <dig> overexpression enhances drought sensitivity
the three independent oex lines evaluated showed an early onset and greater severity of visual wilting, and poorer recovery from a drought stress compared to untransformed controls . differences in visible wilting were most pronounced at  <dig> and 7 days after withholding water, with oex lines displaying between 48-60% and 35-45% higher wilting rates, respectively . when plants were re-watered at the end of the drought period and allowed to recover for 24 h, 66% of the wild-type plants recovered compared to  <dig>   <dig>  and 44% in the oex lines . together with data obtained from loss-of-function mutants, the results implicate hsi <dig> as a negative regulator of drought tolerance.

hsi <dig> altered plants respond to an exogenously applied aba
to study the possible interaction between hsi <dig> and aba during drought stress, we assessed the drought response of the hsi2- <dig> mutant and line oex <dig> pre-treated with -aba and -8’-acetylene aba, also known as pbi <dig>  <cit> . this synthetic analog is resistant to 8’hydroxylation, the principal aba catabolic pathway in arabidopsis <cit> . consequently, pbi <dig> is more persistent in planta and has stronger hormonal activity  <cit> . the ability of pbi <dig> to enhance drought tolerance in arabidopsis has been shown to be mediated through aba signalling  <cit> . whether pbi <dig> and aba act through the same signaling pathway can be tested by binding to the family of pyl receptors. nevertheless, available information indicate that pbi <dig> offers several advantages over natural aba when the sustained presence of hormonal activity is required, as is the case in this study.

in control treatments where plants were root-drenched with water prior to water withdrawal, hsi2- <dig> plants displayed less wilting, and oex <dig> plants more wilting, than the wild-type at all observation times . when plants were given a root-drench treatment with aba  or pbi <dig>  before withholding water, the onset of visible wilting was delayed in all genotypes by three to four days , after which the mutant continued to display less wilting, and oex <dig> more wilting, than the wild-type at all observation times . recovery from wilting upon re-watering was evaluated under control and aba analog treatments, where the hsi2- <dig> mutant recovered the best upon re-watering, followed by the wild-type and oex <dig> plants . however, the overall recovery upon re-watering was lower in all genotypes pre-treated with pbi <dig> 

hsi2- <dig> mutants display lower stomatal conductance
lower stomatal conductance has been associated with higher drought tolerance in many plant species including arabidopsis <cit> . accordingly, stomatal conductance was measured to investigate possible mechanisms underpinning the increased drought tolerance in the hsi <dig> mutant. leaf stomatal conductance in well-watered hsi2- <dig> plants was 77% of wild-type values , suggesting lower constitutive stomatal conductance. pre-treatment with pbi <dig> resulted in a  <dig> -fold reduction in stomatal conductance in the wild-type and a  <dig> -fold reduction in hsi2- <dig> , with the hsi2- <dig> mutant displaying 42% of wild-type stomatal conductance following pre-treatment with pbi <dig> . these results suggest that the mutant is able to better maintain water status through regulation of stomatal properties and that loss of hsi <dig> does not substantially affect associated aba signaling.

the hsi2- <dig> mutant accumulates less aba metabolites during drought stress
to examine the involvement of hsi <dig> in aba metabolism during the drought response, levels of endogenous aba and its metabolites were measured in leaves of hsi2- <dig>  oex <dig>  and col- <dig> before drought stress, at visible wilting, and upon rehydration. in the absence of drought, levels of all metabolites were similar in the three genotypes . endogenous aba content increased dramatically under drought stress in all three genotypes, and reverted to near pre-stress levels upon re-watering. however, hsi2- <dig> accumulated relatively lower levels of aba during drought and was better able to recover to original levels after re-watering compared to oex <dig> or col- <dig>  levels of aba metabolites, namely aba-glucose ester , dihydrophaseic acid , phaseic acid , and trans-aba  also increased substantially under drought stress in all genotypes . the hsi2- <dig> mutant accumulated less of these metabolites than col- <dig>  while oex <dig> contained levels comparable to col- <dig>  with the exception of t-aba, which was lower in 35s:hsi <dig>  consistent with the reports that the 8’-hydroxylation pathway is the most important aba catabolic pathway in arabidopsis <cit> , the products of this pathway , were the most abundant during drought stress and after rehydration . unlike aba, the levels of most metabolites remained much higher after rehydration than they were pre-drought, with dpa levels remaining as high as during drought stress. these results indicate that drought-induced aba biosynthesis and catabolism is of smaller amplitude in the mutant line, resulting in a more modest increase in both aba and aba metabolites, while rehydration reversed the effect of drought on aba biosynthesis but not aba catabolism.

the hsi2- <dig> mutant accumulates lower levels of stress-induced metabolites during drought stress
to ascertain the role of hsi <dig> during stress-induced metabolic reprogramming, levels of several compounds were measured by undirected metabolic profiling and compared between hsi2- <dig> and col- <dig> before drought stress, at visible wilting, and upon rehydration. overall, drought treatment increased levels of numerous metabolites previously reported to be drought-inducible  <cit> , including soluble sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, organic acids and antioxidants . levels of several metabolites were also depleted under drought conditions. with some exceptions, most metabolites reverted closer to non-stress levels upon rehydration.

relatively few of the stress-regulated metabolites were found to accumulate differentially in the two genotypes tested . these included sugars , amino acids , and the sugar alcohol ribitol, levels of which were lower in the mutant than the wild-type under drought stress. similarly, the products of the lysine degradation pathway, n6-acetyllysine, 2-aminoadipate and pipecolate, which have been shown to accumulate under osmotic stress in brassica napus <cit>  and suggested to have osmoprotectant properties in bacteria  were also lower in the mutant compared to wild-type under drought conditions. in contrast, hsi2- <dig> had significantly higher levels of ferulate, an intermediate of the phenylpropanoid pathway, before and during drought . lower levels of known stress-induced osmolytes and osmoprotectants in the hsi <dig> mutant at wilting are consistent with plants experiencing relatively milder dehydration stress than the wild-type.

analysis of drought transcriptomes indicates that drought-induced genes are down-regulated in the hsi <dig> mutant
to characterize the consequences of loss of hsi <dig> function on gene expression relevant to drought stress, genome-wide expression analysis was undertaken with the hsi2- <dig> mutant under a normal watering regime  and after withholding watering, before the onset of visible wilting  and at visible wilting . gene expression in the mutant was compared with its wild-type  under each watering regime by co-hybridization using dual color microarrays. genes corresponding to  <dig> unique agis were identified as being differentially expressed  at stage  <dig>  and the numbers of differentially expressed unique agis increased with the severity of drought to  <dig>  and  <dig>  . consistent with differences in drought responses observed between the mutant and wild-type , the most significant go enriched terms for biological process identified in lists of differentially expressed genes were response to stress and response to biotic or abiotic stimulus . the relative p-values for these terms decreased with the severity of the drought treatment. the identity of genes differentially regulated under the three watering regimes changed considerably. of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed at stage  <dig>   <dig>  are specific to this stage and only  <dig> genes were differentially regulated under all watering regimes. for representative genes, microarray results were validated by kinetic reverse-transcriptase pcr  .

genes differentially expressed in the hsi <dig> mutant were compared with those regulated in response to drought stress. given the poor overlap of genes reported as being differentially expressed during drought stress in different studies , genes regulated by drought in our datasets were identified by comparing probe intensity values from individual channels between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> in col- <dig>  the direction of change for these genes in our datasets was overwhelmingly the same as those from published studies employing whole genome microarrays and similar drought regimes .

genes found to be induced in response to drought stress in our dataset  were predominantly down-regulated when differentially expressed in the hsi <dig> mutant  at stage  <dig> , while genes repressed by drought were mostly up-regulated  when differentially expressed in the hsi <dig> mutant at this drought stage . similar patterns were observed when genes differentially expressed in hsi <dig> vs. col- <dig> at stage  <dig> were compared to published lists of drought-regulated transcripts of huang et al. <cit>  or the progressive drought  and aba-induced genes of harb et al.  <cit>  . analysis of go terms enriched in genes induced by drought and down-regulated in hsi <dig> vs. col- <dig> at stage  <dig> identified predominantly drought-associated processes, including response to abiotic stimulus, aba, and water deprivation . these terms were not enriched in the gene list induced by drought and up-regulated in hsi <dig>

in cases where multiple related classifications were significant, only a subset is listed. lists with fewer than  <dig> genes are not shown. enrichments were performed at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/atcoecis using p <  <dig> .

comparisons of gene lists differentially expressed in hsi <dig> vs. col- <dig> at stage  <dig> to lists from wilkins et al.  <cit>  or the moderate drought  treatments of harb et al.  <cit>  failed to identify a clear trend between the direction of change in hsi <dig> vs. col- <dig> relative to drought inducibility/repression . however, drought-induced genes from these moderate drought treatments, the pdr of harb et al. <cit> , and the present study were predominantly up-regulated when differentially expressed in hsi <dig> vs. col- <dig> at stage  <dig>  reaching over 80% for genes induced in mdr <dig> and mdr <dig> of harb et al.  <cit>  and up-regulated in hsi <dig> vs. col- <dig> at stage  <dig> . genes repressed by drought or aba did not show the complimentary trend and no clear trends were identified in the stage  <dig> data. notable go terms enriched in drought-regulated genes differentially expressed in hsi <dig> vs. col- <dig> at stage  <dig> or stage  <dig> include response to abiotic, temperature and chemical stimuli, and oxidoreductase activity . taken together, these results indicate that the hsi <dig> mutant constitutively expresses a number of drought- and aba-responsive genes but under wilting conditions, the induction or repression of drought- and aba-regulated genes is attenuated relative to the wild-type.

accumulation of aba-responsive transcripts in response to the aba analog pbi <dig> is not compromised in the hsi <dig> mutant
to ascertain the possible involvement of hsi <dig> during the early responses to aba and osmotic stress, rna was extracted from two-week-old seedlings of col- <dig> and hsi2- <dig>   <dig> h after treatment with pbi <dig> or peg  <dig>  and the expression of selected genes was analyzed by k-rt-pcr. steady-state mrna levels of five well-known aba responsive marker genes  continued to show wild-type induction to pbi <dig> and peg  <dig> in the hsi2- <dig> mutant, while rab <dig> mrna levels were higher in hsi <dig> than col- <dig> following exposure to the aba analog .

of  <dig> genes tested that have been implicated in aba signaling, mrna levels for three   <cit>  were highly induced by pbi <dig> but displayed identical expression patterns in col- <dig> and hsi2- <dig> . transcripts for phospholipase dα <dig>  and anac <dig>  both positive regulators of aba signalling  <cit> , showed higher levels of expression in the mutant than wild-type following treatment with pbi <dig>  with pldα <dig>  mrna levels in hsi <dig> were also higher in the control and peg  <dig> treatments, suggesting constitutive differences in expression rather than altered responses to aba and drought. expression of era <dig>  which encodes a farnesyl transferase and a negative regulator of aba signalling  <cit> , was not inducible by pbi <dig> and showed no consistent differences between col- <dig> and hsi2- <dig> 

two genes implicated in mediating drought stress  were highly inducible by pbi <dig> . while hsi2- <dig> and col- <dig> displayed identical patterns of expression for rd <dig> in control and pbi <dig> treatments, expression of the transcription factor cbf <dig> was higher in hsi2- <dig> following treatment with the aba analog. expression of neither myb <dig>  myb <dig> nor erecta were inducible by pbi425; however, levels of myb <dig> in hsi2- <dig> were lower in the control, but not the pbi <dig> treatment and myb <dig> levels were higher in hsi <dig> following pbi <dig> treatment. levels of erecta mrna also showed a trend of being higher in the hsi <dig> mutant under different treatments, although differences were more obvious in the peg  <dig> treatment. differences in erecta expression were also observed in rosette leaves before and after drought stress . thus, the loss of hsi <dig> function did not affect the expression of most genes tested within 4 h of pbi <dig> treatment. a longer-term study may reveal latent changes in aba-inducible expression, if any, of these genes in the mutant compared to the wild type.

discussion
our analyses establish a role for hsi <dig> in response to water stress during the vegetative stage of the arabidopsis life cycle. specifically, loss of hsi <dig> function results in plants better able to maintain physiological water potential under limiting water conditions, as indicated by reduced wilting and higher leaf rwc , while overexpression of hsi <dig> yields a complementary phenotype. these results are consistent with hsi <dig> acting as a negative regulator. the ability of the hsi <dig> mutant to avoid low water potential is likely attributed, at least in part, to lower stomatal conductance , effectively reducing transpirational water loss. consistent with this phenotype, the mutant constitutively expresses higher levels of genes implicated in reducing water loss or improving water use. these include erecta, a positive regulator of water use efficiency through control of stomatal density and conductance  <cit>  and phospholipase dα <dig>  a positive regulator of aba-induced stomatal movement and early-stage drought resistance  <cit>  . conversely, the transcription factor gtl <dig>  a negative regulator of water use efficiency through its effect on stomatal density  <cit>  is down-regulated in hsi <dig> at stage  <dig>  despite these changes in gene expression, no differences in stomatal density were obvious between the hsi <dig> mutants and their corresponding wild-types in preliminary analyses. stomatal density in arabidopsis is developmentally controlled and affected by the environment  <cit> . accordingly, more detailed analyses are required of both stomatal density and aperture. it is noteworthy that hsi <dig> transcripts are likely preferentially expressed in guard cells in the absence of stress  <cit> , and thus could be involved in the direct or indirect regulation of guard cell genes.

an unanticipated finding of this study was the reduced levels of numerous metabolites and gene transcripts associated with tolerance to dehydration stress measured in the hsi2- <dig> mutant, compared to col- <dig>  this includes lower levels of aba and several aba metabolites  as well as osmolytes and osmoprotectants . global analysis of gene expression revealed that most genes up-regulated under severe drought conditions are expressed at lower levels in hsi2- <dig> than in col- <dig> . among go terms highly enriched in these lists of genes include response to abiotic stimulus, response to water deprivation, and response to aba stimulus . it is noteworthy that levels of many of these metabolites continue to be induced, and levels of gene transcripts up-regulated, under drought conditions; it is the magnitude of change that is dampened in the mutant compared to the wild-type. these results are consistent with hsi2- <dig> plants experiencing, or at least perceiving, a milder dehydration stress than the wild-type under the conditions tested. one possible explanation for these findings is that the ability of hsi2- <dig> seedlings to maintain rwc and avoid low water potential for a longer time than col- <dig> delays the onset of cellular dehydration and attenuates its severity. indeed, based on our metabolite and gene expression data, there is no evidence to indicate that hsi2- <dig> seedlings should have greater tolerance to dehydration stress. this includes expression analysis of several genes associated with dehydration stress in seedlings treated with a peg solution that simulates dehydration stress . the possibility that hsi <dig> affects drought tolerance by regulating other, and possibly, novel pathways cannot be excluded at this time and requires further investigation. among the go terms most significantly enriched in genes differentially expressed in hsi <dig> vs col- <dig> are endomembranes and chloroplasts and represent potential targets for future studies. included in the endomembranes group are a number of transporters  such as mate efflux family proteins, proton-dependent oligopeptide transport  family proteins, auxin efflux carriers, abc transporters, a delta tip , sugar and nitrate transporters and a cytochrome oxidase. recently, differential expression of genes encoding pumps and transporters were associated with increased drought tolerance of rice near isogenic lines  <cit> .

seeds acquire desiccation tolerance during the final stages of maturation. desiccation tolerance is also an important component of drought tolerance, and parallels between the two processes have been drawn previously  <cit> . hsi <dig> is known to be required for repression of seed maturation genes upon germination and the transition to vegetative growth  <cit> . in the absence of direct evidence for altered hsi <dig> activity in response of drought stress , it could be argued that increased drought tolerance of the hsi <dig> mutant is a secondary effect triggered by the derepression of seed desiccation genes during vegetative growth. indeed, transcripts of four genes encoding lea proteins are constitutively up-regulated in leaves of the hsi <dig> mutant  and go terms consistent with antioxidant activity  are enriched . however, these changes are unlikely to account for the altered dehydration avoidance responses described above. overall, 23% of genes differentially regulated in hsi <dig> at stage  <dig> are also differentially expressed during the later stages of seed maturation, with 16% showing the same directionality of change in both conditions . these values are lower than those observed in seedlings of hsi <dig> mutants  <cit> . given that hsi <dig> regulation of seed maturation genes is dependent on sugar  <cit> , the differences are likely attributed to the inclusion of sucrose in the media used to grow seedlings. an alternative possibility is that hsi <dig> may only be required for a limited period of time during vegetative development for repressing seed maturation programs, as reported for pickle  <cit> . of note, the seedling studies reported up-regulation of gene encoding master regulators of seed maturation . of these, only transcripts of fus <dig> were detected above background in leaves three-week-old col- <dig> or hsi <dig> plants, and its expression was not altered by loss of hsi <dig>  thus, activation of seed maturation genes in leaves of the hsi <dig> mutant is likely to involve different signalling events. in a number of organisms, genes regulating embryogenic events have been shown to be required at later stages of development, including in response to stress  <cit> . thus, a role for hsi <dig> in repressing seed maturation genes upon germination and later, in response to water stress, is not unprecedented.

our results indicate that hsi <dig> is not absolutely required for aba signalling during drought stress. both the -aba and its analog pbi <dig>  which increase drought tolerance by activating aba responses and aba signalling  <cit> , continued to effectively induce greater drought tolerance in both the hsi <dig> mutant and 35s:hsi <dig> plants without altering the relative tolerance of these genotypes compared to the wild-type . pbi <dig> was also effective at reducing stomatal conductance in the mutant, with levels continuing to be lower than the wild-type following treatment . furthermore, the expression of several genes involved in aba synthesis and signalling was unaltered in the mutant 4 hr after treatment with pbi <dig> , suggesting the mutant is not affected in its ability to respond to this hyperactive aba analog, and presumably to aba itself. in cases where gene expression was different between the mutant and wild-type following pbi <dig>  it was typically also altered in the absence of pbi <dig>  suggesting an aba-independent cause. although differences in the levels of several aba-responsive genes were observed between hsi <dig> and wild-type when plants displayed visible wilting symptoms, these were measured several days following water withdrawal, thus complicating interpretation. altered patterns of gene expression under these conditions are likely attributed, at least in part, to different levels of aba in the mutant at wilting, which in turn we hypothesize to result for better maintenance of water potential in the mutant. although the effects of pbi <dig> are mediated through aba signalling, global transcript profiling indicates that the two compounds do not act in an identical fashion  <cit> . furthermore, exogenous application of growth regulators is limited in its ability to resolve the function of endogenous ones. for these reasons, additional research will be required to study the relationship between hsi <dig> and aba. this should include evaluating the role of endogenous aba and aba signalling by epistatic analysis of hsi <dig> and mutants defective in aba synthesis or perception, such as nced <dig> 

given that hsi <dig> is an ear-dependent transcriptional repressor  <cit> , it could act to limit the transcription of a subset of drought-inducible genes when water is abundant. such target genes would be constitutively de-repressed upon loss of hsi <dig> function, as observed in comparisons of hsi <dig> and col- <dig> transcriptomes at stage  <dig> , conferring a benefit to the mutant upon initial exposure to limiting water conditions. several previously reported stress responsive genes from arabidopsis, including sfr <dig>  lea4- <dig>  atpal <dig>  atcims, egy <dig>  atcp <dig>  athal <dig>  athsp- <dig>  far <dig>  and gdh <dig>  are differentially expressed in hsi <dig> in the absence of a drought stress. notably, nearly all of the differentially expressed genes involved in cellular/transmembrane transport  are up-regulated in the mutant suggesting more active transport and detoxification than in the wild-type. also consistent with detoxification, possibly of reactive oxygen species known to accumulate in response to abiotic stress, is the enrichment of go terms for oxidoreductases and flavonoids in hsi <dig> at stage  <dig> . we speculate that hsi2-mediated transcriptional repression is naturally relieved upon perception of limiting water conditions. transcript levels of hsi <dig> do not appear to be altered in response to stress , suggesting that de-repression of drought-related hsi <dig> targets is likely mediated by translational or post-translational modification of hsi <dig>  several ear-containing plant proteins have been shown to be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation or poly-ubiquitination, providing a potential means of relieving their repressive effects on gene expression .

CONCLUSIONS
by subjecting single hsi <dig> mutants and plants overexpressing hsi <dig> to simulated drought stress by withholding watering, we have demonstrated a role for the putative chromatin remodelling factor hsi <dig> during drought stress at vegetative stage of the arabidopsis life cycle life. although elucidating the exact role of hsi <dig> will require additional research, available information indicates that it fulfils a negative role in maintaining physiological water potential under limiting water conditions and as such represents a potential target for genetic manipulation towards the development of crops better suited for cultivation under water-limited environments. formal demonstration that hsi <dig> activity is regulated in response to drought stress will be important to resolving its biological role at this stage of the plant life cycle. the identification of direct targets for hsi <dig>  the dynamics of hsi <dig> binding to these targets and the associated epigenetic state of the targets following water withdrawal will be required to clarify the involvement and mechanism of action of hsi <dig> in mediating drought-related gene expression.
