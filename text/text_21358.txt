BACKGROUND
the differentiation of vascular tissues is an intensively studied aspect of plant development. part of this interest is driven by the economic importance of xylem as a major constituent of forage crops, wood, and lignocellulosic biomass for transport fuels. xylem is characterised by highly specialised and easily identifiable water-conducting cell types, i.e. tracheids in gymnosperms and tracheary elements  in angiosperms. xylem also contributes to the physical support of plant structures, which is imparted by either fibres  or tracheids. primary xylem arises through the differentiation of pro-vascular cells near the apical meristem and secondary xylem differentiates from fusiform initials in the cambial zone  <cit> . environmental conditions and developmental state modulate xylem composition and properties  <cit> , as well as cell characteristics  <cit> , through the action of growth regulators such as auxin, ethylene, and gibberellins, together with regulatory proteins such as transcription factors.

insights into the regulatory components of xylem development, including transcriptional regulators, have been derived from functional analyses in the herbaceous model plants arabidopsis thaliana  heynh., zinnia elegans , and oryza sativa   <cit> . homeo-domain leucine zipper class iii  proteins represent a group of transcription factors that have been extensively implicated in the regulation of primary and secondary vascular tissue pattern formation, as well as lateral organ and cambial polarity in herbaceous annual plants. it stands to reason that hd-zip iiis may also play key roles in secondary vascular growth and wood formation in perennials including shrubs and trees, but there is relatively little evidence to elucidate such a role, except for the report by ko et al.   <cit> .

there are several different classes of plant homeobox genes  <cit> . one of the major groups of these genes is hd-zip, which is divided into classes i to iv. both the dna-binding homeodomain  and the basic leucine zipper domain , the latter of which has protein dimerization properties  <cit> , are conserved in all four classes. members of the hd-zip iii and iv classes also share a steroidogenic, acute regulatory protein-related domain associated with the lipid-transfer  domain  <cit> . in addition, class iii hd-zips have a characteristic c-terminal mekhla domain that shares significant similarity with the pas domain, reported to dimerize with the ap <dig> domain of the transcription factor drn/esr- <dig>  <cit>  involved in embryo patterning and auxin transport  <cit> .

five different hd-zip iii proteins have been functionally characterised by different approaches in a. thaliana. they include revoluta , phabulosa , phavoluta , corona  and athb- <dig>  arabidopsis revoluta  mutants have altered interfascicular fibre development and impaired auxin polar transport  <cit> . over-expression of rev in arabidopsis resulted in weakly radialized vascular bundles, and altered leaf, stem and carpel organ abaxial, adaxial pattern polarity. over-expression of the z. elegans zehb- <dig>  a homologue of rev, led to an increased number of xylem precursor cells and the accumulation of a variety of transcripts, including brassinosteroid-related sequences and vascular preferential transcripts in zinnia  <cit> . analyses of double phb:phv mutants showed that the two genes share redundant functions both in establishing organ polarity and in vascular development  <cit> . in arabidopsis, athb- <dig> is an early marker for procambial development, vein patterning, and differentiation  <cit> . its over-expression caused ectopic proliferation of xylem cells and precocious initiation of secondary growth; however, the athb- <dig> loss-of-function mutant had no obvious vascular phenotype  <cit> . in contrast, cna mutants and antisense plants have increased vascular tissues and defects in organ polarity  <cit> , while cna over-expression leads to smaller vascular bundles, indicating that it likely acts as a negative regulator of procambial cell identity or proliferation. transcript accumulation in a few hd-zip iii sequences is regulated by auxin   <cit>  and brassinosteroids  <cit> . post-transcriptional gene silencing by micrornas is highly conserved in plants and specifically targets all of the hd-zip iii genes through the binding of mir165/ <dig>  <cit> .

functional analyses of hd-zip iii genes in herbaceous plants, including a. thaliana and z. elegans, have provided a useful template against which similar functions regulating secondary vascular growth can be investigated in woody plants   <cit> . as genetic selection and breeding activities in trees are being expanded to include genetic mapping and molecular markers, candidate genes like hd-zip iii are considered as potential markers which could be associated with wood properties. in this context, the aim of this study was to characterise the hd-zip iii transcription factor family and assess potential involvement in vascular development of trees. previous reports  <cit>  have provided indications that the number of hd-zip iii genes and gene family structure may vary between species, especially between angiosperms and gymnosperms. we evaluated and compared gene family structure in poplars  and white spruce picea glauca  voss with that described for herbaceous annuals to clarify the evolutionary status of hd-zip iii in these groups. transcript profiles were examined across several tissues to assess their putative involvement in secondary vascular growth. in poplar, the accumulation of hd-zip iii gene transcripts was specifically examined in differentiating secondary xylem  in relation to auxin transport, a key driver of tracheary element differentiation  <cit> . the putative roles of poplar genes ptahb <dig> and ptahb7from to distinct well characterised subclades with contrasted functions in crops were examined with respect to over-expression effects upon vascular differentiation and rna transcript profiles.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of hd-zip iii genes from conifer and hardwood trees
four putative full-length hd-zip iii coding sequences were isolated from p. glauca by est data mining, rt-pcr, and race cloning  with degenerate primers. two class-iv sequences from p. abies have been previously reported and were denoted pahb <dig> and pahb <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we designated the sequences that we isolated as pghb <dig>  <cit>  to pghb <dig> . predicted amino-acid sequences display the structural features of hd-zip iii, except that pghb <dig> has a partially degenerated leucine zipper motif.

the populus trichocarpa genome sequence  <cit>  was reported to contain eight different hd-zip iii sequences, which are designated hb <dig> to hb <dig>  <cit> . hd-zip iii genes are distributed on seven of the nineteen poplar chromosomes . we isolated full-length coding cdna sequences for eight on the putative poplar hd-zip iii genes by rt-pcr, amplification, starting from the p. trichocarpa  × p. deltoides  hybrid clone h11- <dig> and from the p. tremula minch × p. alba l. clone 717-1b <dig>  for each of the eight cdna clones, nearly perfect sequence identities were used to match the cdna sequences with previously identified ests and genes predicted from the poplar genome  <cit> , thus providing evidence that all of the predicted genes are expressed in populus spp.

there are five hd-zip iii genes in the arabidopsis genome belonging to the two major phylogenetic clades rvb and c <dig>  each of which is divided into two subclades  <cit> . floyd et al.   <cit>  and prigge and clark   <cit>  conducted phylogenetic investigations that included hd-zip iii sequences from diverse plants, along with full-length and partial pinus taeda l. cdna sequences. they concluded that conifer hd-zip iii genes could be assigned to the two major angiosperm clades of c <dig> and rvb, but two of the conifer sequences were likely part of gymnosperm-specific clades. in this report, a neighbour-joining  tree  <cit>  was constructed with complete amino acid sequences from several seed plants, including gymnosperms such as p. glauca and p. taeda, and angiosperms such as a. thaliana and p. trichocarpa, as well as lower plants such as the moss physcomitrella patens  bruch & schimp. the resulting tree topology was consistent with previous reports; however, our data suggest that conifer sequences may in fact be uniquely represented in the c <dig> clade and absent in the rvb clade . the conifers that we analysed may thus have three c <dig> members, including sequences previously assigned to the rvb clade. the full-length p. glauca pghb <dig> and the partial p. taeda ptahd- <dig> and ptahd- <dig> fell outside angiosperm clades and formed a monophyletic group, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . sequence similarity and tree topology clearly grouped the populus sequences as four pairs of closely related paralogues, which is consistent with the ancestral salicoid genome-wide duplication and reorganisation described in modern salicaceae  <cit> .

hd-zip iii transcripts accumulate during secondary vascular growth in picea and populus
transcript accumulation was profiled in young p. glauca and p. trichocarpa × deltoïdes trees  grown under controlled conditions by using rt-qpcr to compare steady mrna levels in several organs and tissues . transcripts of the four spruce sequences accumulated preferentially in the differentiating secondary xylem of stems  and roots  and gave similar profiles overall . pghb <dig>  pghb <dig> and pghb <dig> rnas were also abundant in the differentiating secondary phloem , and pghb <dig> had the highest relative abundance in the young foliage  . the data suggested that the different transcripts differ substantially in abundance since the normalised number of rna molecules varied by two orders of magnitude between the highest and lowest rnas, i.e., pghb <dig> and pghb <dig>  respectively. the aforementioned data are consistent with putative roles in vascular differentiation, with little indication of diversification between the gene sequences.

compared with spruce, poplar hd-zip iii genes gave more diversified transcript accumulation profiles across the panel of organs and tissues, even within pairs of closely related paralogues . the pair ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb <dig>  which are close homologues of revoluta, gave relatively similar profiles across the panel, except that ptdhb <dig> was less abundant in mature and old leaves than in developing tissues. furthermore, ptdhb <dig> transcript abundance was two orders of magnitude higher than ptdhb <dig>  the pair ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb <dig>  closest homologues of corona/athb- <dig>  shared similar transcript profiles which varied strongly between the organs surveyed. both were clearly most abundant in the developing secondary xylem , but also accumulated in the apex and primary stem. on average, ptdhb <dig> was five to ten times more abundant than ptdhb <dig>  the pair ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb <dig>  which are the closest homologues of athb- <dig>  gave dissimilar and even opposite transcript profiles. ptdhb <dig> transcripts were abundant in nearly all organs and lowest in the apex  and developing secondary xylem , whereas ptdhb <dig> transcripts were most abundant in these same tissues . transcripts of ptdhb <dig>  which was a close homologue of phv and phb, largely accumulated in the apex and to a much lower degree than in other parts of the trees, especially the roots. data are not reported for ptdhb <dig> because its amplification by rt-qpcr was not strong enough for reliable determinations.

over-expression of wild-type ptahb <dig> and ptahb <dig> genes in transgenic poplars
transgenic poplar trees that overexpressed the complete coding sequence of ptahb <dig> and ptahb <dig> were obtained to investigate the potential roles of these hd-zip iii genes in tree development. the hybrid poplar clone inra-717-1b <dig>  was transformed using agrobacterium with either one of the ptahb constructs or an empty vector control . several hygromycin-resistant and gus-positive lines were recovered and used to produce viable plants grown to an average height of  <dig>  m in the greenhouse. all of the lines had transgene transcript accumulation levels which were significantly above levels detected for the inra- <dig> endogene . interestingly, all of the lines overexpressing ptahb <dig>  had a visible external phenotype that was not seen in the controls , but no phenotype was observed upon over-expression of ptahb <dig> .

total rna from the same samples as those used for the microarray profiling: portion of the main undergoing primary growth  for ubi::ptahb1; scrapped secondary xylem  for ubi::ptahb <dig> transgenic poplar. *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> ; sd, one standard deviation.

further characterisation of the ptahb <dig> transformed trees showed that ptahb <dig> transgene transcripts were five to eight times more abundant than the ptahb <dig> endogene in the controls. the most obvious phenotype in these trees was their drooping leaves. the trees appeared to have a water-stress phenotype  which was clearly not the case given that they were grown alongside perfectly healthy control trees. upon closer inspection, it was evident that ptahb <dig> over-expression resulted in altered petiole development, causing the leaves to hang downward. other than the petiole, the leaves seemed to develop normally and to be perfectly healthy, with no indications of altered water relations. on average, the transgenic poplars had petioles that were 15% shorter, and the angle between the adaxial side of the leaf and the stem was 30% wider than those of control trees . the increased angle and decreased length were statistically significant starting at the 10th internode from the apex   .

the vascular organisation of petioles from mature leaves was examined to further investigate the altered development. cell wall autofluorescence associated with lignin accumulation was observed in transverse sections under uv-illumination, and clearly indicated that the distribution of fibres and vessels was altered in the transgenic trees . the ratio of fibres  to vascular elements  was  <dig>  in the transgenic trees, compared to  <dig>  in the controls .

furthermore, quantitative determinations of fibre lengths in stems and petioles through fqa  showed that petiole fibres from immature  and mature leaves  were slightly, but significantly shorter in the transgenic trees . shorter fibre classes <  <dig>  mm were over-represented in the transgenic trees, whereas longer fibre classes  were significantly under-represented compared to the control trees . the fibre length classes from primary stems  followed a similar distribution pattern, but the mean fibre length was not significantly different between controls and transgenics. secondary xylem fibres from the main stem, which were sampled from the same internodes as the petioles , did not differ between the transgenic and wild-type trees.

effect of ptahb <dig> over-expression on the transcriptome
primary stem tissues from two control lines  and two ptahb <dig> transgenic lines  were compared using a  <dig>  k low redundancy cdna microarray . a total of  <dig> transcripts that accumulated differentially were expressed with a false discovery rate  threshold set to 5%  . out of the  <dig> significantly misregulated genes,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in the transgenic trees . the portion of the stem that we targeted in this analysis is also the part of the tree where petioles are actively developing and growing. approximately one-third of the misregulated genes  had strong statistical support . however, the fold-change of all genes identified was less than two .

rt-qpcr analyses were carried out with gene-specific dna primer pairs representing  <dig> putatively misregulated genes, to confirm the microarray data. these analyses used the same rna samples as those used for microarray profiling plus two additional biological replicates . fold difference ratios from rt-qpcr results showed that twelve transcripts were congruent with the microarray results, while four genes gave no difference and four genes yielded conflicting results . data indicate that we were able to validate a subset of these misregulated sequences by rt-qpcr, which is consistent with a previous study reporting low rates of rt-qpcr validation when microarray fold-changes are less than two  <cit> . thus, our relatively low validation rate is not surprising and could be explained by other factors, including cross-hybridisation of closely related genes to the cdna probes, for which we could not account  <cit> .

microarray results are for primary stem tissues. fold differences  were derived from two independent transgenic lines  .

the predicted functions of the misregulated transcripts in the ptahb <dig> transgenics were examined and separated into four categories: growth factor-related, cell wall-related, membrane trafficking, and general functions. the growth factor group included sequences related to brassinosteroid action, which are putative leucine-rich bak1-like proteins . these genes were down-regulated and suspected to be involved in steroid signal transduction  <cit> . genes for ethylene perception and response were also down-regulated . cell wall-related sequences were an abundant category of down-regulated transcripts. other sequences related to cell expansion and cell proliferation were down-regulated, including sequences encoding two fasciclin-like proteins   <cit>  two glyoxalases   <cit> , a farnesylated protein   <cit>  and an elongation factor  <dig> . the down-regulated sequences also included a 4cl gene  that is involved in the synthesis of g-lignin precursors, and which is consistent with the decrease in auto-fluorescent fibres  <cit> . the up-regulated sequences encoded transketolase-like proteins putatively involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis   <cit>  and in decreasing cell proliferation in preparation to dormancy  <cit> .

the impact of ptahb <dig> and ptahb <dig> transgene expression on the other hd-zip iii gene transcripts was investigated in the transgenic poplars . in general, the ubi::ptahb <dig> constructs led to decreased transcript accumulation of all other hd-zip iii genes. however, the number of rna molecules was quite variable and the effect was significant only for ptahb <dig> . in ubi::ptahb <dig> transgenic trees, the hd-zip iii genes had slightly increased transcripts levels, but only ptahb <dig>  ptahb <dig> and ptahb <dig> were significantly upregulated .

accumulation of some, but not all hd-zip iii transcripts is linked to auxin in poplar
given that some hd-zip iii genes have been linked to auxin transport during vascular development  <cit>  and that ptahb <dig> overexpression affected the accumulation of several transcripts related to growth regulators, we examined whether or not auxin influenced transcript accumulation of hd-zip iii genes in developing secondary xylem of young poplar trees. removal of the stem apex, which is the primary source of auxin in the plant, significantly decreased the transcript level of ptdhb <dig> in the xylem tissue by nearly four-fold  and had a similar effect ptdhb <dig> but it was not found to be statistically significant , and did not affect ptdhb <dig> . the application of n- phthalamic acid  to a portion of the stem undergoing secondary growth  significantly decreased transcript abundance for ptdhb <dig>  ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb <dig> . the only gene affected by both treatments was ptdhb <dig>

discussion
vascular development is a finely tuned process that is integral to primary growth, i.e., stem elongation, as well as secondary growth, i.e., radial or diameter growth. the differentiation and growth of the primary vasculature derives from the apical meristem, whereas secondary vascular tissues derive from the cambium. the specific spatio-temporal control and action of regulators enable the coordinated differentiation of the vasculature and other tissues during plant development. in plant model systems such as arabidopsis and zinnia, it has been established that key events underlying vascular differentiation involve a few different hd-zip iii transcription factors. this small family of regulators are known for their overlapping expression profiles and their functional redundancy. the aim of this study was to develop insights into the role of hd-zip iii genes in secondary xylem formation in forest trees. we examined the hd-zip iii gene family in two unrelated tree species belonging to the angiosperms  and the gymnosperms .

distinct hd-zip iii gene family evolution in gymnosperm and angiosperm trees
gene sequences isolated from the moss p. patens with features typical of hd-zip genes of class i, ii, and iii clearly indicate that they were acquired early in plant evolution  <cit> . the sequence analyses presented here  are consistent with the idea that hd-zips have evolved through gene or genome duplications and potential gene losses  <cit> .

the phylogenetic tree we described  included four full length hd-zip iii cdna sequences of p. glauca and was similar but not entirely congruent with the tree topology previously predicted with a bayesian procedure that used full length and partial cdna sequences from p. taeda  <cit> . on one hand, previous authors have reported that gymnosperm hd-zip iii sequences could be assigned to both the c <dig> and rvb clades defined in angiosperm plants. on the other hand, they showed that gymnosperms also formed two independent clades not represented in angiosperms. our results are consistent with the existence of gymnosperm clades with representatives from pinus and picea. these findings support the hypothesis that modern hd-zip iii family structure derives from four ancestral sequences, and that two of the ancestral sequences have been lost in angiosperms leading to clades c <dig> and rvb, whereas all four clades have potentially been retained in gymnosperms. however, our finding that the rvb clade lacked conifer sequences and the lack of a reference gymnosperm genome sequence led us to conclude that further analyses are needed to confirm whether or not gymnosperms are in fact represented in the rvb subclade.

poplars have three more hd-zip iii sequences than arabidopsis, which is consistent with the inferred genome evolution of the former  <cit> . the poplar sequences clearly formed four pairs of closely related paralogues. the salicoid plant lineage that gave rise to the family salicaceae  appears to have undergone a relatively recent genome-wide duplication and reorganisation  <cit> , whereas arabidopsis is thought to have undergone genome size reduction  <cit> . these different evolutionary paths could have led to the loss of certain functions as well as neofunctionalisation or subfunctionalisation within the angiosperms.

transcription profiles identify hd-zip iii putatively involved in vascular development
delineating the potential role of hd-zip iii genes in regard with vascular development is aided by comparing rna transcript accumulation in different organs, tissues and cell types, despite the overlapping profiles that may be observed within the family. members of the c <dig> clade have been most strongly linked to vascular development and have not been implicated in leaf formation as such. in arabidopsis, athb-15/cna is expressed in procambial cells where it is involved in early initiation of vascular cells, and has been implicated in embryo polarity. the athb- <dig> gene product has been shown to promote the proliferation and differentiation of xylem cells. its expression also localizes to pro-cambium cells, in addition to being modulated by auxin  <cit> . the transcripts corresponding to the three p. glauca sequences we assigned to the c <dig> clade were detected in all tissues but preferentially in differentiating secondary vascular tissues both in the stem and in the roots. this observation may represent evidence in support of the phylogenetic position of picea sequences pghb- <dig> to pghb- <dig>  along with several other gymnosperm sequences, in clade c <dig> rather than rvb. in populus, there are four c <dig> sequences ptdhb <dig> to ptdhb <dig> with varied transcript accumulation profiles in vascular tissues. the accumulation of ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb- <dig> transcripts were also clearly preferential to secondary xylem tissues. in contrast, the paralogous sequences ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb <dig> have very dissimilar profiles and were distinctly not preferential to secondary xylem. these transcript accumulation profiles of ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb <dig> indicated that populus c <dig> sequences may have undergone relatively recent neofunctionnalisation or subfonctionnalisation, compared to the pair of ptdhb <dig> and ptdhb <dig> which share the most similar expression patterns. overall, it appears that gene duplications found in gymnosperm c <dig> clade, and even the more ancient duplications at the family level , have not led to strong diversification of expression profiles compared to that observed in angiosperms.

lateral organ formation has been assigned to rvb clade that includes rev, athb- <dig>  and athb- <dig> . the closely related genes phb and phv are involved in leaf polarity, while rev has been implicated in several developmental processes, including vascular cambium identity and activity, as well as fibre differentiation. two putative homologues of arabidopsis rev genes have been detected in the genomes of populus, z. elegans, o. sativa and z. mays l.  <cit> . the functions of the zinnia rev homologues appear to have diverged, with one being implicated in vascular development and the other in lateral organ formation  <cit> . in contrast, the populus hb <dig> and hb <dig> have similar transcript patterns, except that hb <dig> transcripts accumulate more strongly in maturing leaves . arabidopsis may represent a unique case with a rev paralog potentially having been lost during ancestral genomic rearrangements  <cit> , and resulting in a gain of function for the remaining rev sequence in developing xylem and leaves. ko et al.   <cit>  found that ptdhb <dig> was associated with secondary growth in poplar stems and hypothesised that hd-zip iii genes played a role in secondary xylem differentiation in trees. our expression survey indicated that ptdhb <dig> transcripts are present at a similar level in the apex, primary stems, secondary xylem, and young roots.

poplar hd-zip iii genes play a role in fibre development
constitutive over-expression of the poplar ptahb <dig> gene in poplar led to greater transcript abundance corresponding to this gene, and resulted in shorter petioles and a wider angle between the stem and adaxial side of the petiole. the fibres with reduced lignification and shorter length suggested that development of primary xylem fibres was either impaired or delayed in the transgenic trees. our hypothesis is that the increased angle between the petioles and the stem is caused by a delayed or incomplete fibre development relative to leaf expansion. asynchronous development may cause the petioles to lack the necessary strength to support a fully expanded leaf. this phenotype bears a resemblance to that of the ifl- <dig> mutant  in which interfascicular fibre development is impaired and inflorescence stems lack sturdiness  <cit> . moreover, it has been observed that rev gain-of-function promotes xylem differentiation and accumulation, leading to dysfunctional vascular patterning  <cit> . it thus appears that the ptahb <dig> over-expression phenotype is closer to the ifl- <dig> mutant phenotype than the rev gain-of-function phenotype. this result contrasts with our initial hypothesis that ptahb <dig> over-expression might promote fibre differentiation.

furthermore, the vascular phenotype observed in ptahb <dig> transgenic poplars was not consistent with previous observations that over-expression of non-mutated hd-zip iii genes had no effect on plant development because of gene silencing by micrornas. in arabidopsis, all of the hd-zip iii family transcripts are targeted and negatively regulated by micrornas  found in multiple copies in the genome  <cit> . moreover, the over-expression of the hd-zip iii sequences was shown to trigger the production of these micrornas  <cit> . an hypothesis to explain our observations may be that hd-zip iii ptahb <dig> over-expression triggered the accumulation of micrornas that down-regulated the other members of the hd-zip iii family. transcript accumulation of the other poplar hd-zip iii sequences provided evidence in support of this hypothesis. interestingly, ptahb <dig> over-expression did not appear to have a similar effect on other family members.

it has long been known that fibre differentiation or stem elongation is controlled by growth factors such as auxin, ga and brassinosteroids, and that overproduction of auxin decreases primary stem elongation in arabidopsis  <cit> . the rev/ifl- <dig> gene of arabidopsis has been implicated in polar transport of auxin  <cit> . considering the known relationship between plant growth regulators and hd-zip iii genes, the delay in petiole elongation in ptahb <dig> transgenics may be linked to a perturbation of growth regulation activity. for example, auxin accumulation may be shifted due to altered polar transport. our observations in young wild-type poplar trees suggested a putative link between auxin and the expression of three different hd-zip iii genes , the transcript levels of which were affected by the application of an auxin transport inhibitor . this observation is consistent with the fact that those gene transcripts are well represented in secondary xylem . plant decapitation  significantly down-regulated transcripts of ptdhb <dig> and had a smaller effect on ptdhb <dig> transcripts. these results are partially consistent with previous reports from arabidopsis, where athb- <dig> was clearly modulated by auxin. gene regulation may have evolved differently in poplar compared to arabidopsis, reflecting the developmental and physiological differences between a woody perennial plant and an herbaceous annual.

the differentially expressed sequences identified in the ptahb <dig> over-expressing poplars were classified into a few broad categories based upon putative functional assignments. most of the transcripts were down-regulated and included sequences related to development pathways: brassinosteroid and ethylene growth regulators, ethylene perception and response, and putative steroid signal transduction proteins, in addition to cell wall-related and cell expansion or cell proliferation proteins. many of the sequences have putative functions that appear consistent with developmental activities of ifl1/rev in arabidopsis. they also appear to be consistent with the functions or pathways related to the phenotype observed in transgenic poplars.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of hd-zip iii genes in vascular development has been complicated by the complex interactions between family members and the pleiotropic nature of the mutant phenotypes  <cit> . nevertheless, the experiments and findings reported here contribute to confirming the involvement of this group of genes in woody plants, including primary and secondary vascular development. taken together, the observations indicate that hd-zip iii gene family structure has considerably diverged between angiosperms and gymnosperms, and suggest that individual genes within each taxonomic group have acquired distinct and specialised functions, some of which are related to secondary xylem growth. the phenotype observed upon over-expression of a wild-type poplar ptahb <dig> gene represents a departure from previous reports in arabidopsis, where gene silencing by mirnas suppressed potential effects of over-expression. the transgenic poplars likely represent a useful system to continue investigating the functions of ptahb <dig>  transcript profiling identified a set of sequences which may be targets of ptahb <dig> or perhaps lay downstream of ptahb <dig> in the developmental cascade. microarray profiling experiments using whole-genome arrays and targeting of other plant tissues related to the transgenic phenotypes would likely help to consolidate the list of candidate targets.

future studies could continue to explore and compare more broadly the role of hd-zip iii genes in primary and secondary vascular growth of woody plants, particularly the poplar pophb <dig>  which appeared the most specific to secondary xylem of all other poplar hd-zip iii. in this regard, hd-zip iii knock-downs  could potentially help to clarify the putative role of poplar hd-zip iii genes. genes encoding regulators of wood formation potentially represent a rich source for identifying genetic markers of wood properties that could used in targeted breeding and selection. it typically takes 10- <dig> years or more to grow trees to the point where they can be selected to develop improved or new varieties; therefore, if such markers are proven effective, they could potentially reduce the selection time and cost.
