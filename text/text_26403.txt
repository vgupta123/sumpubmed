BACKGROUND
small rnas regulate a lot of plant developmental and physiological processes including organ polarity, mirna pathway, leaf and floral development  <cit> . in eukaryote, microrna , small interfering rnas , piwi-interacting rnas , scanrnas and 21u-rnas were produced, and these types of small rnas were associated with different ago family members including ago, piwi and group  <dig> proteins to act biological functions  <cit> . guided by mirnas, ago proteins recognize target genes at complementary sites to repress gene translation by cleaving target mrnas meanwhile binding to cap structure of mrnas, and in some cases to repress gene transcription by rna directed dna methylation  <cit> . typical ago protein contains a variable n-terminal domain, a conserved c-terminal paz domain that recognizes the 3′ end of small rnas, a mid  that binds to the 5′ phosphate of small rnas and a piwi domain carrying an asp-asp-his  motif as an active site which exhibits endonuclease activity similar to that of rnaseh  <cit> .

each ago protein performs biological functions differently by binding to small rnas and direct transcriptional regulation or/and post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. for example, ago4-like proteins combined with  <dig> nt small rnas to methylate dna  <cit> . ago1-like proteins cleaved target mrna or/and repressed coding process directed by mirnas  <cit> . ago2-like proteins fought against virus infection guided by sirnas generated from double strand virus rnas, which were synthesized by rna-dependent rna polymerase  using viral rna as templates  <cit> . ago7mir <dig> complex directed synthesis of trans-acting  <dig>  by recognizing two complementary sites of mir <dig> in primary transcript of tas <dig>  in addition, tas <dig> regulated expression of arf <dig>  arf <dig> and arf <dig> post-transcriptionally  <cit> . both ago <dig> and ago <dig> played roles in stem cell differentiation. ago <dig> played as a locker of mir165/mir <dig> in shoot apical meristem  development, while mir165/mir <dig> cooperated with ago <dig> to suppress sam maintenance  <cit> .

subcellular localization of plant ago protein help researchers to understand the mechanism of rna induced gene silencing. localization signals of atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig> were detected in cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . among detected ago proteins, localization of atago <dig> was clearly characterized so far. along with  <dig> nt sirnas, pol-iva, rna dependent rna polymerase <dig>  and dicer-like  <dig> , ago <dig> co-localized to nuclear cajal-bodies, site of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein  complex maturation  <cit> . ago <dig> also localized to a second class of nuclear bodies, called ab-bodies, which also contained other proteins involved in rna-directed dna methylation  <cit> . recent research revealed binding to sirna facilitated redistribution of ago <dig> into nucleus  <cit> . still, there are a lot of unrevealed questions about localization of ago proteins.

ago proteins play important roles in virus defence as core element of risc. mutations of atago <dig> and atago <dig> are hypersensitive to virus infection  <cit> . interestingly, both ago <dig> and ago <dig> were found regulated by mirna. mir <dig> was considered as feedback regulator of ago <dig>  while ago <dig> was a putative target gene of mir <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, plant viral genome codes risc repressors to combat with plant virus defense system. for example, 2b encoded by cucumber mosaic virus inhibits ago <dig> cleavage activity  <cit> ; polerovirus f-box protein p <dig> degrades ago <dig>  <cit> ; p <dig> binds to mirna/mirna* and sirna duplex to inhibit formation of active riscsmall rna and p <dig> has ability to modulate the endogenous mir <dig> level to inhibit translational capacity of ago <dig> mrna, resulting in alleviation of the anti-viral function of ago <dig> protein  <cit> . because of the fact that virus repressors developed strategies to break ago1-dependent plant defense system and putative mechanism that mir <dig> regulated ago <dig> in the form of ago1mir <dig> complex, harvey proposed that ago <dig> and ago <dig> represented the first and the second layer to rna-mediated defense and counter-defense in the interactions between plants and plant virus  <cit> .

recently, ago proteins were found participated in regulation of reproduction. an ago gene  specifically detected in germ cell was essential for the progression of premeiotic mitosis and meiosis during sporogenesis in rice  <cit> . mutations of ago <dig> induced multiple gametic cells differentiation which led to multiple gametogenesis  <cit> , and deficiency of ago <dig> in maize led to production of viable gametes without meiosis  <cit> .

tomato is the model plant for fleshy fruit development. however, a very few research about ago protein on fruit formation and development of tomato was reported. indeed, over-expression of p <dig> in tomato resulting in reduction of both slago1a and slago1b dramatically modified the radicalization of leaflets, petals and anthers  <cit> . however, the way by which small rnas function remains unknown. in our study, examination of ago genes expression pattern in fruit formation and development progress of tomato will be beneficial to understand potential roles of ago genes in fruit development. meanwhile, localization of ago proteins demonstrated potential pathways of small rnas function in tomato. moreover, verification relationships between ago genes and mirnas reveal conserved regulation between agos and mirnas, functions of which are still unknown in tomato.

RESULTS
genomic distribution, gene structure, isolation, and phylogenetic analysis of slagos
chromosomal locations and directions of  <dig> slago genes were determined and demonstrated using blastn analysis on tomato wgs chromosomes   <cit> . slago family genes in tomato locate in chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , but none of the slago genes distribute in chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  . interestingly, there was only  <dig> bp in tomato genome between cloned sequences of slago <dig> and slago2b, this kind of short gap was also found between genomic sequences of atago <dig> and atago <dig>  similar protocol was used to determine exons position in slago genes. numbers of exons in slagos genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , see in additional file  <dig> 

3′ race or 5′ race were employed to verify the predicted cdna or est sequences. <dig> predicted slago genes were located in the tomato genome, and only  <dig> slago genes cds were cloned: slago1a, slago1b, slago2a, slago2b, slago <dig>  slago4a, slago4b, slago4d, slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago10a. the length of sequenced cdnas varied from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp , see results in additional file  <dig>  rna used to clone slago genes was a mix simple extracted from the whole plant of flowering tomato and fruiting tomato.

polypeptide sequences of slagos were generated by primer  <dig>  in different open reading frames , the longest ones were further analyzed and verified with online tool of pfam finder . the orf length of slago genes ranged from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp , which encoded polypeptides varied from  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa . all polypeptides of slago proteins harbored duf <dig>  paz and piwi domain, but gly-rich ago <dig> domain was only found in orf of slago1a and slago1b . high ratio of g and q were found in n terminus of slago1a, slago1b, slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago <dig> polypeptides and g-q percentage were analyzed in n terminus domain. there were <dig> % g and  <dig> % q in  <dig> aa n terminus of slago1a,  <dig> % g and  <dig> % q in  <dig> aa n terminus of slago1b, 16% g and  <dig> % q in  <dig> aa n terminus of slago2a,  <dig> % g and  <dig> % q in  <dig> aa n terminus of slago <dig> .

interestingly, although  <dig> bp of slago2b cdna was amplified in our work, only  <dig> bp which coded duf <dig>  paz and piwi domains were found in the orf with  <dig> stop signals presented in 5′ terminus sequence . three individual clones of slago10a were sequenced and  <dig> bp fragment of slago10a was amplified, but a stop signal presented at the position of  <dig> aa in the predicted orf coding  <dig> aa. alignment were performed between predicted cdna and sequenced cdna. an extra sequence “tagttgttttgcaacctctttctctttttttccttgtccatttctctttcaggtcgatgtttgttaaagacacgaagacgattgacctttgctcctgtgcgttatgctgacagg” was found in sequenced cdna, which located in chromosome  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  the 11th exon of slago10a genomic sequence . but the stop signal was alternatively spliced in est sequence  which was 100% matched to predicted cdna of slago10a. a slago10a <dig>  alternative splicing cdna was generated according to our results and sgn-u <dig>  5′ race results of slago2a and one clone of slago2a cds showed an extra “gccggcagaggtggaggtaacc” localized to sl <dig> ch02: 33782189– <dig> and an extra “ttttgctgtgaactggtctgacgg” localized to sl <dig> ch02: 33785522– <dig>  which coded “agrgggn”  and “favnwsdg”  respectively. however, these two fragments were not detected in another clone of slago2a <dig> , while both of them were located in n terminal variable domain.

the phylogenetic tree was generated from alignment of full-length protein sequences of the  <dig> cloned slago genes  and the  <dig> atago genes  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis showed that  <dig> slago proteins divided into three major clades which were similar to those in arabidopsis . atago1-like clade included slago1a, slago1b, slago <dig>  slago10; atago4-like clade included slago4a, slago4b, slago4d, slago6; atago2-like clade included slago2a, slago2b, slago <dig> and slago <dig> . interestingly, slago proteins which were grouped into the clade of atago <dig> or atago <dig> possessed at least  <dig> exons, while slago proteins which were grouped into the clade of atago <dig> only had  <dig> to  <dig> exons . sequence information, genomic distribution, gene structure and multiple alignments of polypeptide were presented in additional file  <dig>  figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

slago1a, slago1b and slago2a are target genes of conserved mirna
 <dig> cloned slagos cdna sequences and  <dig> predicted cdna of slago4c, slago <dig> were performed blast in tomato putative mirna database and conserved plant mirna in mirbase  <cit> . slago1a and slago1b were found complementary to mature slmir <dig> , and slago2a was found complementary to mature atmir <dig>  putative pre-slmir <dig> was found in tomato genome and its structure was folded by rna folder version  <dig>  . cleavage sites of complementary sequence to mirnas were detected by 5′ race.  <dig> over 8th positive clone showed cleavage site localized between 10th and 11th nt of mir168;  <dig> over 10th positive clone showed cleavage site localized between 10th and 11th nt of mir168;  <dig> over 9th positive clone showed cleavage site localized between 10th and 11th nt of mir <dig> .

slagos proteins localized to cytoplasm and nucleus
camv:slagos-gfp vectors were constructed and transformed into by <dig> protoplast and subcellular localization of slagos were observed. generally, there were two types of subcellular localization of slagos: type  <dig> which includes slago1a, slago <dig> and slago <dig> localized to nuclear membrane and cell membrane, while type  <dig> including slago2a, slago <dig>  slago4a, slago4b and slago <dig> expanded to cytoplasm and nucleus . interestingly, slago1b localized to nucleus , to cytoplasm  or both to cytoplasm and nucleus  and slago4d localized to cyt oplasm and nucleus  or localized around nucleus . slago1a localized to spot structure around nucleus . moreover, subcellular localization of mutation at the complementary site to mir <dig> without altering polypeptide sequence of slago1a expanded to nucleus and cytoplasm, not only spot structure around nucleus as the subcellular localization of slago1a .

different expression pattern of slago genes
previously, expression patterns of slagos were detected in shoots, roots, flowers, mixture of green fruit and red fruit, and slago4c, slago4d and slago <dig> could not be detected  <cit> . in our study, slago4c and slago <dig> could not be detected in any of collected tissues as well, but full cds of slago4d were cloned and slago4d could be detected in flower and early stages of fruit development. expression patterns of slago genes were detected in roots, stems, leaves and flowers. as a result, slago1a, slago1b, slago2a, slago2b, slago <dig>  slago4a, slago4b, slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago <dig> and slago10a could be detected in all four organs, while slago4d and slago <dig> could be detected in flowers only .

according to length, flower buds were grouped into  <dig> stages: stage  <dig> was flower buds when the length was no more than  <dig> mm, stage  <dig> was  <dig> to  <dig> mm, stage  <dig> was  <dig> to  <dig> mm, stage  <dig> was  <dig> to  <dig> mm and stage  <dig> was  <dig> to  <dig> mm flower buds. slago4c and slago <dig> could not be detected in any collected stages and slago <dig> displayed gradually enhanced expression during bud development, slago <dig> could be detected on stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> of flower buds only .

flowers were divided into stamens, ovaries, petals and sepals. slago1a, slago1b, slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago4a, slago4b, slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago <dig> and slago10a could be detected in all four parts, but expressions of slago <dig> and slago10a in ovaries were significantly higher than in other parts of flowers. slago2b and slago4d could be detected in ovaries but not in other parts of flowers .

stamens were collected on  <dig> days before anthesis , the first day of anthesis  and  <dig> days post anthesis  respectively. slago2b, slago4c, slago4d, slago <dig> could not be detected in any of these collected stages when  <dig> cycles of pcr was performed. slago1a, slago1b, slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago4a, slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago <dig> and slago10a could be detected in three stamen developmental stages, while slago4b could be detected in - <dig> dpa stamens .

to understand function of slago genes in fruit development, fruit were harvested on  <dig> days before anthesis , the first day of anthesis ,  <dig> days post anthesis ,  <dig> days post anthesis ,  <dig> days post anthesis ,  <dig> days post anthesis , about  <dig> days post anthesis  and about  <dig> days post anthesis . slago1a, slago1b, slago2a, slago2b, slago4a, slago4d, slago <dig>  slago <dig> and slago10a could be detected in all collected stages. expression of slago4a and slago4b in - <dig> dpa fruit was significantly higher compared to that in  <dig> dpa fruit, but gradually up-regulated in  <dig> dpa fruit, reached the peak in  <dig> dpa fruit and followed by down-regulation in  <dig> dpa fruit, yellow fruit and red fruit. slago4d and slago <dig> shared similar expression pattern with slago4a and slago4b, but slago4a and slago4b expression strongly in  <dig> dpa fruit. slightly expressed slago <dig> was detected in  <dig> dpa fruit and  <dig> dpa fruit. interesting expression pattern was found in slago <dig>  which expressed highly in - <dig> dpa fruit and slightly down regulated in  <dig> dpa fruit and  <dig> dpa fruit, but dramatically reduced in the detected stages after  <dig> dpa .

discussion
in eukaryote, ago proteins are conserved gene family and the core part in all-known small-rna-directed regulatory pathways which regulate developmental progress by repressing expression of the target genes  <cit> . for example, ago <dig> and ago <dig> regulate shoots apical meristem under the direction of mir165/mir <dig>  <cit> ; ago <dig> affects develop timing and patterns under the direction of tas <dig>  <cit> . in this study, out of  <dig> cloned slago genes,  <dig> have generated complete protein, while slago10a had a stop signal in predicted orf.  <dig> slagos and  <dig> atago proteins were grouped into three clades by phylogenetic analysis   <cit> . each of slago gene has homologous gene in arabidopsis, indicating that slago genes might have similar functions in tomato as atago genes in arabidopsis.

homology of slago1a and slago1b was  <dig> %, but slago1a and slago1b might play different roles in tomato development. there was an extra  <dig> aa gq-rich sequence in the n terminus of slago1b, and the percentage of q in slago1b was much higher than that in slago1a . expression of slago1a was different from that of slago1b in fruit, which was much higher in  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa fruit compared to other detected stages of fruit development, while expression of slago1b soldierly changed in all detected tissues . slago1a localized to spot around nucleus , but slago1b localized to nucleus , to cytoplasm  or both to cytoplasm and nucleus . different subcellular locations and expression patterns shown two ago1-like genes might function differently in tomato.

as known, mirnas guide agos to regulate target genes, meanwhile atago <dig> was regulated by mir <dig> and atago <dig> was regulated by mir <dig> respectively  <cit> . in arabidopsis, co-ip experiment presented ago <dig> bound with mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and ago <dig> bound with mir <dig> as well  <cit> , which demonstrated multiple ago proteins participated in post-transcript regulation of ago <dig> protein via mir <dig> and ago <dig> mrna might be regulated by mir <dig> in the form of ago1mir <dig> complex. moreover, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are conserved micrornas, which can be detected in tomato . in our study, slago1a and slago1b were found to be cleaved by mir <dig>  and slago2a was found to be cleaved by mir <dig>  our findings proved relationships between mir <dig> and ago <dig>  mir <dig> and ago <dig> were conserved in tomato. unlike the feedback control of mir <dig> to ago <dig> is important for proper plant development, importance of mir403-mediated ago <dig> is still unknown  <cit> . however, recent researches might reveal the mystery of the relationship between mir <dig> and ago <dig>  as mir <dig> and mir <dig> were down-regulated when plants receive virus infection signal and both ago <dig> and ago <dig> mutations were hypersensitive to virus infection, ago <dig> and ago <dig> represented the first and second layer to rna-mediated defense and counter-defense in the interaction between plants and plant-virus  <cit> . based on these facts, a hypothesis of relationship between mir <dig>  mir <dig> and biological function of ago <dig>  ago <dig> in virus defense was presented:

as the key element in risc, ago proteins was up-regulated during virus infection, meanwhile over-expression of ago proteins would induce plant development disorder  <cit> . so regulation of ago proteins to maintain suitable amount in both condition are crucial for virus defense and plant development. virus employ strategies to interfere rna induced gene silencing depending on ago proteins. there are four strategies of viral suppression rna induced silencing process which had been identified to date: 2b interferes activate site of ago protein; p <dig> and p <dig> inhibit formation of riscvsirna formation, moreover p <dig> is found to induce mir <dig> accumulation which represses expression of ago1; the polar virus f-box protein p <dig> can bind to ago <dig> then degrade ago <dig> to suppress rna induced silencing of viral genes  <cit> . these strategies show the importance of ago proteins in rna induced silencing-depended defense system, and no matter what strategies virus employ, up-regulation of ago proteins in plant is crucial for success in defense against virus.

during viral infection, mir <dig> was found down-regulated at the early stage and up-regulated at the later stage  <cit> . expression of mir <dig> indicates the following regulation pathway: at the beginning of virus infection, mir <dig> is down-regulated, agosmir <dig> complex are reduced subsequently. as losing post-transcriptional repressor, accumulation of ago <dig> protein is initiated, and defense of virus infection is performed mainly by ago1vsirna. at later stage, mir <dig> is up-regulated, ago1mir <dig> and ago2mir <dig> act as feed-back regulation to maintain suitable ago <dig> proteins for plant development. but when ago <dig> is suppressed, accumulation of ago1mir <dig> is lower than that under ordinary condition, consequently mir <dig> is down-regulated during virus infection as ago can protect binding mirnas  <cit> . then ago <dig> is accumulated as a result of reduced repression from ago1mir <dig>  so viral rnas are wiped out by ago2vsirnas.

recently, atago <dig> and zmago <dig>  which were homologous to atago <dig>  were found to have the ability to repress somatic fate in germ cells  <cit> . in present work,  <dig> ago genes were cloned and expression patterns in different organs and developmental stages in stamens and friut were detected. reversal “v” style expression patterns of slago4a, slago4b, slago4d, slago <dig> in fruit development were found. interestingly, these slago genes were grouped into atago <dig> clade which might play similar roles in tomato fruit development as well as atago <dig> and zmago <dig> did, especially the candidate slago4d which specifically expressed in friut.

in rice, an atago1-like gene mel <dig> expressing in reproductive organs regulates cell division of premeiotic germ cells  <cit> . in tomato, there are  <dig> slago genes belonged to ago <dig> clade . among five slago1-like genes, slago <dig> expresses in flowers and fruit, the expression pattern of which is similar to that of mel <dig>  indicating that slago <dig> might function in regulation of reproductive organ formation in tomato.

the unique expression pattern during fruit development indicated that slago <dig> might participate in formation of fruit. there were evidences that could demonstrate potential pathway. first, atago <dig> was found participating in synthesis of trans-acting  <dig> by direction of mir <dig>  and atarf <dig>  atarf <dig>  atarf <dig> were regulated by tas  <dig>  <cit> . second, atarf <dig> and atarf <dig> had ability to mediate organ asymmetry. moreover, mutant phenotype of arf <dig> was restricted in flowers  <cit> . third, over-expression of mir-arf interfered with expression of arf <dig>  arf <dig> and arf <dig>  resulting in abnormal short style and thickened green stigma  <cit> . slago <dig> expressed extremely high in - <dig> dpa fruit and was dramatically down-regulated in fruits collected after  <dig> dpa to red fruit, indicating that slago <dig> which is homologous to atago <dig> might regulate early stage of fruit formation, most likely through directing synthesis of tas  <dig> to maintain suitable expression of arf <dig>  arfa <dig> and arf <dig> 

localization of ago protein helps understand mechanism of small rnas generation and their functions. atago <dig> localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm and a large nucleoplasmic signal was observed  <cit> . atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig> were found to localize to cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . in our study, subcellular localizations of  <dig> slagos were detected. slago1a, slago <dig> and slago <dig> localized to nuclear menbrane and cell membrane , while slago <dig>  slago <dig>  slago4a and slago4b localized to cytoplasm and nucleus. interestingly, unlike other ago1-like genes, localization of slago1a seemed to be restricted in specific structure around nucleus in tomato , the function and mechanism of which is still unknown. localizations of ago1-like genes in tomato indicated the potential for agomirna/sirna monitoring target mrnas when mrnas were transporting out of nucleus before translation initiating.

to check localization under the mimic condition of losing control of mir <dig>  slago1amut which harbored four points mutation at complementary site of mir <dig> was employed. localization of slago1amut expanded to nucleus and cytoplasm , indicating mir <dig> might regulate localization of slago1a. in recent years, it was found that nucleus localization of ago <dig> could be determined by binding to small rnas  <cit> . differently, ago <dig> could bind to a double stranded rna  binding domain protein hyponastic leaves <dig>  in d-body, indicating that formation of mature mirna and resemble of ago1mirna complex were coupled in nucleus  <cit> . in our study, fluoresces of slago1a: gfp and slago1b: gfp were not strong in nucleus . but slago1amut expanding localization to nucleus indicates that localization of slago1a protein is adjusted by feedback regulation of mir <dig>  as the fact that sirnas and mirnas are generated from cytoplasm and nucleus respectively, when mir <dig> is down-regulated, subsequently slago1a protein is transported to cytoplasm and nucleus in order to accelerate formation of slago1asirna/mirna complex. then, suitable protein expression of target genes is monitored by slago1asirna/mirna complex.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> slago genes were cloned and their expression patterns in fruit development were detected in tomato. conserved relationships between slago genes and mirnas were discovered and identified in tomato. moreover, localizations of slago proteins and regulation of slago1a localization by mir <dig> were observed. in tomato, identification and characterisation of ago proteins will be beneficial to the research on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of fruit formation and development through risc pathway.
