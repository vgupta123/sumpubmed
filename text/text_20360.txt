BACKGROUND
ggas  and ap - <dig> are both clathrin adaptor proteins that function in the intracellular sorting of a number of biologically important transmembrane proteins between the golgi and endocytic pathway. where the ggas are monomeric adaptors, ap- <dig> is a heterotetramer of  <dig> subunits . both ggas and ap- <dig> are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. in mammals there are three gga genes giving rise to gga <dig>  gga <dig> and gga <dig>  and multiple isoforms of the ap- <dig> subunits. in contrast in drosophila melanogaster there is only a single gga ortholog, and only one isoform of each ap- <dig> subunit.

the function of ggas has been elucidated largely by knockout studies in yeast  <cit> , and rnai knockdowns in mammalian  <cit>  and drosophila tissue culture cells  <cit> . from these studies and others it is clear that ggas function to sort a number of proteins for incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles, including sortilin, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor , cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, sorla, ldl receptor-related proteins , β-amyloid cleavage enzyme , insulin-responsive aminopeptidase and stabilin- <dig> . ggas sort cargo by recognition of an acidic dileucine  motif usually at the c-terminus of the cytoplasmic tails. in addition to binding ggas, many of these cargo proteins contain sorting signals for binding other adaptors. cimpr is the best studied cargo protein in mammalian cells and it has a complex intracellular trafficking itinerary between the golgi and endosomes. to facilitate its sorting it contains numerous sorting signals, which are recognised by ap- <dig> and gga   <cit> . the only known gga cargo in drosophila is lysosome enzyme receptor protein , which is the functional equivalent of cimpr, and like cimpr contains both gga and ap- <dig> clathrin adaptor sorting motifs  <cit> .

the functional inter-relationship of ggas and ap- <dig> has been actively debated. both have been localised to the trans-golgi network  and endosomal membranes. ap- <dig> was shown to contain a binding site for ggas, and this suggested the possibility that the role of ggas may be to 'hand-on' cargo to ap- <dig>  <cit> . however, the observation that in yeast ggas and ap- <dig> behave differently in the sorting of cargo in cell-free assays  <cit> , and the visualisation in drosophila dmel <dig> cells of distinct populations of clathrin-coated vesicles that contain only gga or ap- <dig>  <cit>  suggests that they can function independently of each other. however, these results do not exclude either ggas acting with ap- <dig> or ggas acting independently of ap- <dig>  nor have these studies addressed how or where ggas function in a complex multicellular organism. for ap- <dig> it is clear that it plays a critical role in development since knockouts of γ adaptin  <cit>  or μ1a  <cit>  in mice are embryonic lethal, and knockout of μ1a in caenorhabditis elegans show reduced viability  <cit> . for ggas, functional studies have been hampered by redundancy between the three mammalian ggas. from the limited information on gga mrna tissue expression we know that all three mammalian ggas are ubiquitously expressed . at the protein level gga <dig> expression has been shown to vary dramatically between different human tissues with expression of both isoforms  of gga <dig> in the brain  <cit> . in addition, both gga <dig> and gga <dig> have been shown to play a role in the sorting of bace <dig> in the brain  <cit> , though the specific contribution of each gga to bace <dig> sorting is unclear. in drosophila, a search of flyatlas  reveals that gga message is found ubiquitously, and at nearly all stages of larval and adult development. to date, there is no information regarding the tissue distribution of gga protein expression in drosophila.

here we show that there is a gender specific higher expression of gga in male drosophila, and show that both gga and ap- <dig> are highly expressed in drosophila testes. in testes squashes both gga and ap- <dig> co-localise with a marker of the tgn, most strikingly at the acroblast in developing spermatids. we also investigate gga function in spermatogenesis using rnai transgenic flies.

RESULTS
gga and ap- <dig> expression in drosophila
in a previous study we raised antibodies against drosophila gga and ap- <dig>  which allowed us to localise both endogenous adaptors in drosophila tissue culture cells  <cit> . here we investigated endogenous gga and ap- <dig> localisation in whole flies to elucidate where these clathrin adaptors may be exerting their function.

western blots from whole fly lysates demonstrated that gga was expressed at higher levels in male flies than in female flies , where ap- <dig> was expressed at similar levels in males and females. we confirmed the relative differences in gga expression levels using immunoprecipitations, and quantification revealed that there was > <dig> fold more gga in the male flies relative to the females. in contrast there were similar levels of ap- <dig> in the males as the females. this led us to investigate the relative expression of gga in dissected head, thorax and abdomens of female and male flies. figure 1b and 1c shows that the majority of gga expression in the females is in their heads  with very little in the abdomens , whereas in the males there are relatively similar levels of gga in male heads  compared to abdomens . interestingly, we also found more ap- <dig> in male abdomens  relative to female abdomens , despite there being the same amount of ap- <dig> overall. the abundance of gga and ap- <dig> in male abdomens can be completely accounted for by their expression in dissected testes .

gga and ap- <dig> localisation in testes squashes
given the abundance of gga and ap- <dig> in testes as determined by western blotting we decided to investigate their role in the testes by localising gga and ap- <dig> in developing sperm. drosophila testes are informative as they exhibit all stages in sperm development in a relatively simple structure. in dissected testes squashes the different stages in sperm development can be readily identified under phase contrast  with characteristic patterns of hoechst dna staining . we labelled testes squashes from control and gga knockdown flies with antibodies against ap- <dig>  gga, and well characterised commercial antibodies against the cis-golgi marker gm <dig>  and α-tubulin . using hoechst as a guide to development stage we were able to distinguish staining of ap- <dig>  gga and gm <dig> in all stages from spermatogonia to spermatid bundles . it was more challenging to visualise the labelling of any antibody in spermatogonia presumably because they are so small, and because antibody accessibility may be an issue. in spermatocytes we observed labelling of ap- <dig> , gm <dig> , and gga  in large puncta dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and this pattern was lost in testes squashes from gga knockdown flies . in addition, we also observed localisation of ap- <dig> and gga in somatic cells of the seminal vesicle . we were struck by the similarity in the staining patterns for ap- <dig>  gga and gm <dig>  which were reminiscent of golgi morphology in drosophila  <cit> . the main feature that distinguishes drosophila golgi from mammalian golgi is that drosophila cells contain a number of smaller golgi stacks  rather than one interconnected ribbon found in mammalian cells. one exception is the acroblast in 'onion stage' spermatids, which is composed of a ribbon of numerous golgi elements that forms the acrosome in mature sperm. therefore the identity of the large puncta that are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in spermatocytes and label for gm <dig>  ap- <dig> and gga are likely to be golgi mini stacks.

we suspected that the localisation pattern of gga and ap- <dig> was most likely to be at the tgn rather than the golgi stack itself . therefore we co-stained testes squashes with antibodies against gcc <dig> as a marker of the trans-golgi/tgn  <cit> , and gm <dig> as a marker of the golgi stack. gm <dig> and gcc <dig> co-localise in large puncta in spermatocytes  that most likely represent golgi mini stacks. in addition, we visualised both markers in 'onion stage' spermatids . the labelling of gcc <dig> is slightly off-set relative to gm <dig> as we would expect since they are on opposite sides of the golgi stack.

we then co-stained testes squashes with antibodies against gcc <dig> and either gga  or ap- <dig> . coincident labelling of both gga and ap- <dig> were observed with gcc <dig> in disperse golgi mini stacks in spermatocytes  and coincident at the cone-shaped juxtanuclear acroblast in 'onion stage' spermatids . we also noted that in gga depleted cells the gcc <dig> labelling appeared similar to that in control cells despite the loss of gga expression . this suggests that the acroblast, at least morphologically, is unaffected in the knockdown flies. the coincident labelling of ap- <dig> and gga with gcc <dig> supports a role for both clathrin adaptors at the tgn in multiple stages of sperm development.

gga rnai knockdown
in order to investigate whether depletion of gga would affect spermatogenesis we used commercially available transgenic rnai fly lines. we used two rnai fly lines with random integration of the same rnai construct on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. knockdown was achieved with a depletion efficiency of >95% as measured in whole fly extracts, with no effect on ap- <dig> expression levels . similar levels of knockdown were seen in both females and males . since knockdown efficiencies can vary between different tissues we wanted to demonstrate that the knockdown was efficient in germ line-derived developing sperm. therefore we isolated testes from control and knockdown flies and by western blotting demonstrated that the efficiency of gga knockdown was >95% , which is comparable to the level seen in whole fly extracts. furthermore we immunolabelled testes squashes from wild type and knockdown flies with antibodies against gga and observed almost complete loss of gga labelling in germ line derived spermatocytes and 'onion stage' spermatids . taken together we believe that we have demonstrated that gga has been efficiently depleted in the developing sperm.

the knockdown flies developed normally, with no gross morphological changes. we assayed the fertility of the male  flies and observed no differences in the ability to produce progeny, neither in rate, number or overall development of the progeny . we also analysed the testes from both control  and gga depleted flies  and by phase contrast saw no qualitative morphological differences in the development of sperm, with both culminating in the production of individualised sperm. these sperm were clearly motile since the sperm were easily visualised when seminal vesicles were accidentally pierced during the dissection . given the efficiency of knockdown these results suggest that gga depletion does not result in any measurable loss of male fertility.

a search for novel gga cargoes
given the enrichment of gga in testes we wanted to investigate what cargo proteins might require gga for their sorting. we therefore constructed a database of cytoplasmic tails of type i transmembrane proteins and searched for those that contain a gga binding consensus . of the  <dig> protein entries in the database only five entries were identified with possible gga binding motifs. reassuringly two of these hits were different transcripts of lerp, the only known gga cargo in drosophila  <cit> . of the remaining three hits the most interesting was 'cueball' because it has been shown to function in primary spermatocyte growth, where mutants in cueball lead to a male sterility phenotype  <cit> . by blast analysis of human databases cueball shows most homology to the family of proteins of low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins . many members of the lrp family contain multiple sorting motifs for binding clathrin adaptors. indeed, lrp <dig> has an acidic dileucine motif that acts as a dual gga and ap-1/ap- <dig> binding motif  <cit> . likewise, cueball also contains a potential dual acidic dileucine motif  and therefore its trafficking may be regulated by a number of coat proteins that includes ap- <dig> and gga. we have previously shown that overexpression of cargo cytoplasmic tails as a cd8-reporter construct  in hela cells specifically increases the recruitment of ggas to membrane , and can be used as a criteria to define novel bonafide gga cargoes. here we found that overexpression of the cytoplasmic tail of cueball  was sufficient to increase the recruitment of mammalian gga <dig> , and supports the idea that cueball is a novel gga cargo protein.

a database of drosophila type i transmembrane proteins were searched for gga binding consensus motifs. five proteins were identified; only the last ~ <dig> amino acids of the cytoplasmic tails are shown here with the amino acids that correspond to a predicted gga sorting motif highlighted in bold.

in summary, we have shown that we can efficiently deplete gga expression to >95% in germ line derived developing sperm, and the knockdown male flies have morphologically normal testes and they exhibit no loss of fertility. therefore with regard to fertility male flies appear to be able to function normally in the presence of <5% gga. in addition, we have also shown that the male flies express > <dig> fold higher expression of gga relative to the females, and that gga is abundantly expressed not only in the head of flies but also specifically in the testes in multiple stages during the process of spermatogenesis. we have also identified cueball as a novel binding partner of gga, and this protein has important functions in the growth of primary spermatocytes. these results suggest that gga plays a role at the tgn in multiple stages of sperm development.

discussion
the ggas were first described in  <dig> and since then our understanding of their role has risen exponentially. in mammalian cells the mrna expression profiles of gga1- <dig> predict that they are ubiquitously expressed , and several studies have identified roles for gga <dig> and gga <dig> in the sorting of bace <dig> in the brain  <cit> . however, their function in multicellular organisms remains elusive due to the absence of animal knockout or knockdown models, and studies in mammalian cells are confounded by their functional redundancy. drosophila not only provides us with a well studied model system but functional redundancy is no longer a confounding factor as there is only a single gga ortholog. a search on flyatlas reveals that gga mrna message is found ubiquitously, and that there is moderate message at all stages of development in nearly all larval and adult fly stages. here we have quantified gga protein levels and show that in female flies the majority of gga expression is in the heads , suggesting that in the females the principal function of gga is in the head. more significantly we show that the male flies express > <dig> fold the total level of gga than the females, and the increase in expression is largely confined to the testes. these results suggest the possibility of two separate roles for gga, one in the head, where the function is shared between female and male flies, and one function in the testes that is specific to the male flies. for this paper we chose to focus our attention on the role of gga in male testes. interestingly, the publically available information on symatlas suggests that there is abundant gga <dig> message in testes. given the similarities between spermatogenesis in mammals and drosophila it would be interesting to determine if there is gender specific higher gga <dig> protein expression in mammals.

in order to determine where gga may be functioning in testes we performed localisation studies in germ line and somatic cells. all antibody labelling was difficult to resolve in early spermatogonia, but gga labelling was readily observed in golgi mini stacks in spermatocytes. spermatocytes are significantly larger than spermatogonia, which probably make it easier to resolve the labelling, but this is also a stage when expression of many proteins involved in spermatogenesis is switched on or upregulated. we also observed the localisation of gga at the cone-shaped acroblast of 'onion stage' spermatids. for ap- <dig>  despite the similar levels of overall protein expression levels in males and females, like gga, there is proportionally more ap- <dig> in the male abdomens compared to the females. this expression is confined to the testes, and localises to the tgn in spermatocytes and 'onion stage' spermatids. this suggests that ap- <dig>  like gga, may also play a role at the tgn in different stages of sperm development. efficient vesicle traffic is necessary in order to support the massive increase in cell membrane surface area which is required for the extensive membrane remodelling to enlarge spermatocytes , to elongate differentiating spermatids , and the final step of individualising spermatids. it is therefore likely that membrane trafficking may play multiple important roles in these massive remodelling events. indeed, clathrin  has been shown to play a role in the remodelling that occurs in the individualisation of spermatids  <cit> . the mechanism of clathrin function is not well understood, but it is possible that one of the roles of gga  may be in cooperation with clathrin in intracellular sorting events during membrane remodelling.

we attempted to further elucidate the role of gga in drosophila spermatogenesis by knocking down gga expression using transgenic rnai fly lines. here we used a tubulin-gal <dig> driver to ubiquitously knockdown gga expression. although knockdowns efficiencies are likely to vary between different tissues we were able to show by western blotting of dissected testes that we achieved >95% loss of gga protein, which was comparable to the level of knockdown we saw in fly extracts. in addition by immunolabelling of dissected testes we saw almost complete loss of gga labelling in multiple stages of germline-derived developing sperm. combined, these data suggest that knockdown of gga in germline was efficient, however, in spite of this efficiency we did not observe any effects on male fertility. it is possible that the remaining <5% gga may be sufficient for some function. however, we have also shown here that ap- <dig>  like gga, is also highly expressed in testes and localises to the tgn in spermatocytes and acroblast of spermatids. in addition, the family of mint proteins have also been shown to localise at the tgn and like ggas function in the sorting of cargo out of the tgn  <cit> . therefore it seems most likely that the lack of a phenotype in our gga depleted flies may be due to the ability of ap- <dig> and/or mint to fully or partially substitute for the loss of gga. it would therefore be interesting to analyse the effects of loss of gga, ap- <dig> and/or mint in spermatogenesis. certainly ubiquitous knockdown of ap- <dig> in drosophila may well be lethal , however, using the gal4/uas system it should be possible to produce conditional tissue-specific inactivation of gga and ap- <dig> in germ line. however, at present there are no male specific drivers currently available .

the expression and localisation of gga and ap- <dig> in germ line cells supports a potential role for these adaptors in the sorting of cargo out of the tgn during spermatogenesis. what cargo might gga be responsible for sorting in testes? as yet the only known cargo for gga in drosophila is lerp  <cit> , which is the functional equivalent of cimpr. lerp contains sorting signals for both adaptors and gga, and it has been shown that ap- <dig> and gga cooperate to traffic lerp between the tgn and endosomes  <cit> . however, this function is unlikely to be restricted to testes . in order to search for other potential gga cargoes we constructed a database of type i cytoplasmic tails, searched for proteins that contain a gga consensus binding motifs, and identified the protein 'cueball'. this was particularly intriguing given that mutants in cueball have been shown to lead to a male sterility phenotype  <cit> . by blast analysis cueball shows most homology to the mammalian family of proteins of low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins . many members of the lrp family contain multiple sorting motifs for binding clathrin adaptors. indeed, lrp <dig> has an acidic dileucine motif that acts as a dual gga and ap-1/ap- <dig> binding motif  <cit> . likewise, cueball also contains a potential dual acidic dileucine motif, and using a cd8-reporter system we have shown that cueball can increase the recruitment of mammalian gga <dig>  which we have shown previously is a criteria for being a bonafide gga cargo protein  <cit> . therefore cueball is likely to be a novel cargo protein for gga, and given the presence of a dual acidic dileucine motif its trafficking may be regulated by ap-1/ap- <dig> as well as by gga . it will be interesting to further elucidate the contribution of gga in cueball trafficking, particularly in relation to its role in spermatocyte growth and development.

CONCLUSIONS
in drosophila we have uncovered a role for gga in the testes of male flies. the gender specific higher expression of gga, its enrichment specifically in testes, and its localisation in spermatocytes and particularly at the acroblast of developing spermatids supports a role for gga in drosophila spermatogenesis. we describe for the first time the knockdown of gga in a multicellular organism and show that in terms of male fertility the flies appear to be able to function with only <5% of gga . since spermatogenesis is remarkably similar in mammals as it is in drosophila, it will be of interest to determine if ggas  play a role in mammalian spermatogenesis.
