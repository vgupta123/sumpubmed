BACKGROUND

escherichia coli infections in poultry constitute a severe animal health issue and a considerable burden to farmers worldwide, in terms of decreased animal welfare and production economy  <cit> . disease in poultry caused by avian pathogenic e. coli  may cause a wide range of extraintestinal symptoms, collectively termed colibacillosis. apec belong to the group of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  , that also includes the pathotypes; uropathogenic e. coli , neonatal-meningitis e. coli  and septicemic e. coli. all groups have been associated with disease in both humans and animals  <cit> , and it has been reported that human expec strains are closely related to apec strains, suggesting that poultry could constitute a reservoir of zoonotic apec strains  <cit> .

in general, apec isolates from chickens constitute a genetically diverse population with numerous of different serogroups and sequence types . the most commonly observed serogroups are o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> , and multilocus sequence typing  has shown that sts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been frequently observed  <cit> . several types of virulence genes are commonly identified in apec as well as in human expec  <cit>  . these are often carried on virulence plasmids and pathogenicity islands  .

nordic broiler production depends on a breeding pyramid where swedish grandparents are mainly imported from scotland and used for breeding of parents for export to farms in the rest of the nordic countries  <cit> . interestingly, previous studies indicated that extended-spectrum beta-lactamase -producing e. coli can be transmitted vertically from parents to offspring through the breeding pyramid . hence, if great grandparents are infected with virulent e. coli, they can potentially disseminate vertically to swedish grandparents and hereafter to parents and broilers across the nordic countries.

from  <dig> until late  <dig>  the mortality on danish poultry farms has on average been decreasing. hereafter, the mortality has increased to > <dig> % in  <dig> and it has been suggested that colibacillosis in both parents and broilers has played a significant role  <cit> . in the same period similar problems with colibacillosis and increased mortality have also been observed on finnish and norwegian farms . the aim of this study was to investigate, using whole genome sequencing, the genetic diversity and potential relatedness of apec isolates associated with increased mortality and colibacillosis in nordic countries.

methods
e. coli isolates
in this study,  <dig> bacterial isolates from danish , finnish , norwegian  and polish  farms were analyzed. additionally, assembled draft genomes obtained from seven bacterial isolates collected from diseased danish chickens, were kindly provided by the danish poultry industry, and their isolation id have in this study been assigned a capital “a” . in total, the  <dig> isolates were collected from  <dig> different farms and if isolates were from the same farm they were in general collected from different houses. the majority of isolates were collected from diseased broiler chickens and parents  and diseased birds were diagnosed with a generalized e. coli infection, whereas  <dig> isolates were collected from healthy birds . the danish isolates were collected from all parts of the country by the two commercial laboratories at lvk  and the poultry slaughterhouse, danpo . the danish farms were not geographically clustered, but distributed evenly throughout the regions with poultry production. notably, the draft genomes of two danish isolates  have previously been annotated and deposited in ddbj/ena/genbank under the accession numbers lxwv <dig>  and lypj <dig>   <cit> , due to their inclusion in a danish autogenous vaccine program. finnish isolates were collected from the southwestern part of finland by the finnish food safety authority . in norway, the isolates were collected from central, south-eastern and western parts of the country by the norwegian veterinary institute . in both finland and norway, the samples were collected from regions where most broiler farms are located.

the illumina reads sequenced in this study were deposited in the ncbi sra  <cit>  under the study accession number srp <dig> 

dna purification and sequencing
isolates were grown overnight at 37 °c on blood agar  supplemented with 5% calf blood ). single colonies were harvested directly from the agar plates and genomic dna was purified using the qiaamp dna mini kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the dna libraries were generated using nextera xt kit  according to manufacturer’s instructions. finally, illumina’s miseq platform was used for paired-end dna sequencing with a read length of 2 × 251 bp for all isolates except the seven isolates from the danish poultry industry which were sequenced with a read length of 2 × 300 bp.

de novo assembly and typing
raw reads were de novo assembled using clc bio’s genomics workbench  v <dig>   with default setting and a threshold on contigs of minimum 500 nt. subsequently, the de novo assembled contigs were mlst  <cit>  and serotyped  <cit>  in silico using online typing tools  <cit> .

core genome diversity
the genetic relationship between all  <dig> isolates was investigated using single nucleotide polymorphisms . snps were identified using nasp  <dig>   <cit>  by aligning illumina reads against e. coli strain cft <dig> , using the burrows-wheeler aligner   <cit>  after removal of duplicated regions in the reference using nucmer  <cit> . gatk unified genotyper  <cit>  was used to identify variant positions and to remove positions with <90% unambiguous base calls, as well as snps in positions that did not meet a minimum coverage requirement of ≥10×. subsequently, a phylogenetic tree model was constructed using the maximum-likelihood algorithm implemented in phyml  <cit>  using smart model selection and the bayesian information criterion with  <dig> bootstrap replicates and visualized using itol v <dig>   <cit> .

further investigations were performed on all identified st <dig> isolates from this study  together with all  <dig> identified st <dig> e. coli strains available at  <cit>  . snps were identified as described above but with purging of recombinant regions using gubbins v <dig> . <dig> with standard settings of five iterations. phylogenetic analyses on the purged dataset were performed as previously described.

identification of virulence and resistance genes
various types of virulence genes were identified in de novo assembled contigs using mydbfinder v﻿ <dig>   <cit>  and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using resfinder v﻿ <dig>   <cit> . further descriptions and genbank accession numbers of the selection of virulence genes are found in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in some cases, clc bio’s genomics workbench was used to verify the presence of the open reading frames by blastn and mapping of reference genes to the de novo assembled contigs.

RESULTS
the majority of the isolates  were sequenced to an average coverage of ≥ <dig> fold, whereas 35/ <dig> of the draft genomes had an average coverage of > <dig>  the rest had an average coverage of > <dig>  whereas seven draft genomes provided by the danish poultry industry exhibited slightly less coverage. assembly metrics  can be found in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

serotyping and mlst
serotype genes were in the majority of the  <dig> assembled genomes, identified with thresholds of ≥90% nucleotide identity, ≥90% coverage of the query and a sequence depth of >10×. however, in eight isolates  the o-type genes were on average identified with 67% coverage of the query and ≥90% nucleotide identity, whereas no o-﻿type genes were identified in nine isolates . the isolates showed a high diversity with a total of  <dig> different serotypes, and mlst analyses identified  <dig> different sts. the most prevalent serotype was o78:h <dig> observed among 43%  of the isolates, whereas 54%  were found to be of st <dig> . of all isolates, 61%  could be divided into six groups associated with the same serotype and st . notably, all six groups presented in table  <dig> were also closely related according to the snp analysis .table  <dig> virulence gene content among  <dig> e. coli isolates

phylogenetic analyses
the snp calling based on all  <dig> isolates had a total of  <dig>  variant positions identified in ~49% of the reference genome. the phylogenetic analysis revealed a large clade of  <dig> isolates from both diseased broilers and parents collected in denmark, finland and norway. isolates from healthy chickens were not related to this clade . all isolates from this clade belonged to st <dig> and  <dig> of these had serotype o78:h <dig> whereas eight had o53:h <dig> . it was not possible to identify o-type genes in six isolates from this clade, but they all carried the h <dig> gene. a single isolates  was of serotype o161:h <dig>  . minor clusters of few isolates with identical serotype and st were present but none of them contained isolates from more than two different countries .

the snp calling based on all  <dig> st <dig> genomes from both this study and those obtainable from the public domain at ncbi  <cit>  had a total of  <dig>  variant positions identified in ~64% of the genomes, and with  <dig>  snps remaining after purging of recombinant regions. the analysis identified a major clade primarily consisting of  <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates from both diseased broilers and parents collected on  <dig> different farms in denmark, finland and norway . on average, the length between these  <dig> isolates was  <dig> snps. in four isolates  from this clade no o-type genes were identified, whereas only one isolate in this clade  belonged to a serogroup different from o <dig> . furthermore, strain gn <dig> obtained from the refseq archive at ncbi  belonged to serotype o24:h <dig>  the  <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates differed by at least  <dig> snps from the o53:h <dig> clade .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood tree of  <dig> st <dig> e. coli based on  <dig>  purged core snps. the analysis includes  <dig> st <dig> poultry isolates and  <dig> international strains. a distinct clade of  <dig> closely related apec isolates collected from both broilers and parents  on danish , finnish  and norwegian  chicken farms was identified. fourty-seven of these isolates were of serotype o78:h <dig> , whereas a single was o53:h <dig> . all isolates from this study were from diseased birds and the reference strain e. coli strain cft <dig> is not included. the scale indicates substitutions per site




identification of virulence and resistance genes
in general, different combinations of virulence genes were identified in the  <dig> draft genomes with thresholds of ≥90% nucleotide identity and ≥90% coverage of the query sequence. . all  <dig> st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates carried a unique combination of nine virulence genes compared to the eight st <dig> o53:h <dig> isolates . however, the isolates in this cluster did not carry any of the investigated virulence genes that were not also present in other isolates, i.e., no virulence genes were unique for this cluster. hlya was not identified in any of the isolates whereas fima/c and ompa were found in almost all isolates. papc, tsh, vat and ibea were only associated with diseased poultry and irod, iron and iss were found in ≥94%  of the isolates from diseased birds . the majority  of all isolates did not carry antibiotic resistance genes. only few  of the st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates carried antibiotic resistance genes, whereas resistance genes were more common among the other groups . the most commonly identified resistance genes were against β-lactams, sulphonamides or streptomycin, and less often against tetracycline or trimethoprim.

discussion
in recent years , an increase in cases of colibacillosis on nordic poultry farms has caused a raise in mortality and economic losses  <cit>  . therefore, the genetic diversity among  <dig> e. coli isolates mainly collected from diseased animals on poultry farms with colibacillosis were investigated. in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , it was found that the poultry isolates were a genetically diverse population. however, we identified a group of  <dig> closely related st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates collected from diseased broilers and parents in multiple nordic countries, which shared a similar genetic background . in concordance, it has previously been reported that apec isolates are widely associated with serogroup o <dig> and st <dig>  <cit> . these  <dig> isolates were not related to any of the isolates from healthy chickens . on average, the distance between these  <dig> isolates was  <dig> snps, whereas the distance to the closest related st <dig> o53:h <dig> isolate outside this group was  <dig> snps . additionally, all  <dig> st <dig> o78:h <dig> carried an identical and unique combination of virulence genes compared to all other investigated isolates . thus, according to both the investigation of virulence profiles and the snp analyses the  <dig> st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates define a distinct lineage. the isolates from this lineage carried nine genes that encode virulence factors important in the pathogenesis of avian colibacillosis . interestingly, o <dig> strains have been suggested to be the main cause of avian colisepticemia together with o <dig> and o2 strains  <cit> . the o-antigen capsule allows bacteria to avoid the host’s innate immune response and studies have shown that this lps capsule is required during systemic infections  <cit> . type i fimbriae encoded by fima/c, have been shown to be necessary for initial colonization of the respiratory system  <cit> . additionally, previous studies suggest that iuca/d and irod which encode aerobactin and salmochelin siderophores respectively, are specifically important for iron acquisition in the extraintestinal environment of chickens  <cit> . as in this study, the virulence factor increased serum survival encoded by iss, was previously identified in apec strains  <cit>  as well as the vacuolating autotransporter toxin vat, but their exact role in the pathogenesis needs to be further elucidated  <cit> . it should also be noticed that some of the virulence genes  were found among almost all analyzed isolates, both from healthy and diseased birds, which indicates that they are not only involved in avian colibacillosis. additionally, a wide range of other virulence factors have also been suggested to be associated with apec  <cit> . none of the investigated virulence genes  were found exclusively among the o78:h <dig> cluster and it may therefore be suggested that other, yet undefined virulence mechanisms were partly responsible for the high virulence of this strain. thus, a comparative study to reveal more precisely why the o78:h <dig> st <dig> lineage was considerably associated with increased mortality among nordic broilers and breeders from 2014– <dig> could be interesting to carry out.

in the nordic countries, all poultry farms receive their parents from swedish hatcheries where grandparents are imported from scotland  <cit> . it was not possible to verify how many swedish parent flocks that the birds included in this study originated from, which could have further revealed the extent of the colibacillosis issues observed on nordic poultry farms. finding highly similar isolates in broilers and parents from distantly located farms that share one common source for parent animals strongly support a vertical dissemination of st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates from grandparents and great grandparent. vertical transmission of pathogenic e. coli has previously been observed in other studies . unfortunately, e. coli isolates from diseased grandparents or great grandparents were not available to further confirm this hypothesis. it could have been interesting to investigate samples from parents and their corresponding offspring but a parent flock can be origin to several different broiler flocks. thus, it is not possible to collect samples directly from parent/offspring pairs  <cit> . instead, an in vivo infection study of parents and their offspring could be carried out.

the  <dig> o78:h <dig> st <dig> isolates carried various types of virulence genes  that previously have been identified in both apec and human upec isolates. additionally, they were closely related to the st <dig> o24:h <dig> e. coli strain gn <dig> from ncbi , which previously has been collected from human body fluids. . therefore, it could be speculated whether the origin of these colibacillosis cases could have been the introduction of human upec to grandparents or great grandparents in the upper parts of the breeding pyramid. strain gn <dig> was sampled in usa but we could not obtain further information regarding possible dissemination via travel activities to europe. thus, diseased chickens could potentially constitute a zoonotic risk to e.g., farmers or other people who get in contact with them  <cit> . additionally, e. coli strains have been found to end up in the broiler chicken meat  <cit> .

since the increase in the occurrence of colibacillosis has a considerable impact on animal welfare and production economy, it is of great importance to obtain more in-depth knowledge regarding apec and colibacillosis and to develop vaccines that possibly could provide immunization of the poultry. interestingly, e. coli strain e <dig>  <cit>  collected from a diseased parent bird, was here shown to be a part of the major st <dig> o78:h <dig> linage. in  <dig>  strain e <dig> was selected for a danish autovaccine program due to its suggested relation to the increase in colibacillosis on danish poultry farms. however, the efficiency of the program remains to be evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic investigation of apec isolates collected from diseased chickens on nordic poultry farms revealed the presence of a predominant lineage of st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates. the analyses indicated that the st <dig> o78:h <dig> strains have been transmitted vertically through the broiler breeding pyramid and contributed considerably to the increase of colibacillosis cases observed on nordic poultry farms from  <dig> to  <dig>
