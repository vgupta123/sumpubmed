BACKGROUND
classical methods for qtl identification involve examination of cosegregation of markers and trait loci in the parents and progeny of experimental genetic crosses or in extended pedigrees  <cit> . however, this requires both phenotyping and genotyping of multiple individual progeny which is time consuming, labor intensive, expensive and places upper limits on statistical power  <cit> . extreme qtl  methods provide a simple way to circumvent these disadvantages and are applicable to any selectable trait . in x-qtl, large groups of progeny are selected for the trait of interest and compared with control groups that are not exposed to selection. selected and unselected pools are quantitatively genotyped to estimate frequencies of genetic markers across the genome. selected and unselected pools show equal representation of frequency across the genome, except in genome regions containing the critical genes that underlie the selected trait. x-qtl methods are a development of bulk segregation methods, originally established by human and plant geneticists in the mid-1980s and the early 1990s , in which individual progeny with different phenotypes were pooled and genotyped. x-qtl methods were independently developed by researchers working on rodent malaria, where the method was referred to as linkage group selection  and was later used on yeast  <cit> , where the term x-qtl was coined. we prefer the name x-qtl and have adopted this term throughout.figure  <dig> 
principle of the extreme-qtl  analysis. x-qtl analysis can be performed on a simple mendelian inherited trait  and drug resistance ) using pools of individuals . individuals with susceptible phenotype  and resistant phenotype  are crossed to generate f <dig> and f <dig> individuals. the f <dig> individuals are divided in two pools: one under no selection  and another under selection . the allele frequency is equal in unselected  and selected  pools across the genome, except in the genome region  containing the critical genes that underlie the selected trait.



here we validate the x-qtl approach for linkage analysis of a biomedically important trait  resistance) in the human blood fluke schistosoma mansoni for which the causative gene  is now known  <cit> . schistosomiasis, the second most important tropical parasitic disease after malaria  <cit> , affects an estimated  <dig> million people across africa, asia, and south america, killing over  <dig>  people per year and is caused by blood flukes of the genus schistosoma
. among the three major schistosome species of medical importance, s. mansoni infects over  <dig> million people in africa, middle east and south america  <cit> . the life cycle of this parasite includes a snail as intermediate host  and humans as definitive host. however, the complete lifecycle can be easily maintained in the laboratory using snail and rodent hosts   <cit> , and there is a rich literature describing heritable variation in a range of biomedically and biologically interesting traits such as drug resistance  <cit> , host specificity  <cit> , and virulence  <cit> . the  <dig>  mb genome of s. mansoni has been sequenced  <cit> , and with the aid of a 5 cm genetic map  <cit>  80% of the scaffolds have been assigned and ordered on chromosomes  <cit> . the genome is composed of  <dig> autosomes and one pair of zw sex chromosomes and contains  <dig>  genes. forty percent of the genome is composed of repetitive elements  <cit> .

we have recently exploited the genome sequence and genetic map to identify, by classical linkage mapping, a qtl region underlying parasite resistance to oxamniquine, one of the two drugs used in the treatment of s. mansoni infection  <cit> . this is the first trait mapped in s. mansoni or in any human helminth infection and resulted in direct identification of the gene and mutations responsible for this trait. while classical genetic mapping is clearly feasible in this organism, it is extremely labor intensive. in the oxamniquine genetic cross,  <dig>  individual snails were exposed to single larval stages to obtain  <dig> snails infected with f <dig> progeny, while measurement of resistance involved daily observation of worm death following drug exposure over a two week period for each of the f <dig> progeny genotypes. hence mapping of oxa-resistance qtl required a concerted effort by three researchers over a two year period. we therefore sought to develop more efficient methods for linkage mapping in this parasite.

x-qtl methods require accurate measurement of genome wide allele frequencies within progeny pools. this has been done by pyrosequencing  <cit> , microarray hybridization  <cit> , and more recently by examining read depth of snps using next generation sequence data   <cit> . the genome of s. mansoni is relatively large , and comprises ~40% repetitive sequences, so we sought to use reduced representation sequencing to minimize cost and maximize read depth in f <dig> progeny pools. several methods using restriction enzymes have been developed for performing reduced representation sequencing for complex genomes , reduced-representation libraries )  <cit> . we opted to use exome capture rather than restriction based methods for several reasons:  obtaining exome sequence data simplifies fine mapping of loci identified following initial qtl location, as most variants involved in phenotypic traits result from changes within coding sequences  <cit> ,  we wanted to avoid sequencing repetitive regions that cannot be unambiguously aligned in a single genomic location ,  polymorphisms within restriction sites have the potential to bias representation of parental alleles within progeny pools when using approaches such as rad-seq  <cit> . this can potentially generate spurious enrichment of particular alleles within progeny pools. a second aim of this work was therefore to evaluate the efficiency of exome capture methods for s. mansoni.

RESULTS
genetic crosses
we staged a cross between an oxa-resistant  male and an oxa-sensitive  female parasites by infecting hamsters with  <dig> male and  <dig> female cercariae larvae of a single genotype. these were derived from snails infected with a single miracidium larva, which reproduce clonally giving rise to 1000s of single sex, single genotype cercariae larvae. male and female f <dig> parasites were crossed in the same way and single f <dig> miracidia were used to infect snails.  <dig> infected snails, each shedding cercariae of a single recombinant genotype, were used in the pooling experiments. these single genotype cercariae comprised  <dig> male and  <dig> female genotypes.

pooling of f <dig> progeny and selection of adult worm pools
each of the f <dig> pools used to infect hamsters contained  <dig> cercariae, representing the  <dig> recombinant genotypes  . we balanced the sex ratio by adding  <dig> representatives of each male genotype and  <dig> representatives of each female genotype to the pools used for each infection  male cercariae :  <dig>  female cercariae per pool). importantly, the f <dig> pools used to infect each of the six hamsters were identical in their genetic composition, so the impact of oxa-treatment on genome-wide allele frequencies can be directly examined.

forty f <dig> females and 16 f <dig> male adult worms  survived oxamniquine treatment in the oxa-treatment group . higher female survival rate following oxa treatment has been observed previously  <cit> . this represents a global survival rate of  <dig> %, relative to the total number of cercariae used in the infections . in the untreated group ,  <dig> females and  <dig> males  were recovered, representing  <dig> % of the infecting dose . hence oxa-treatment results in a ~10-fold reduction in survival relative to controls, consistent with strong drug selection.

exome capture performance: quality and efficiency
a set of  <dig>  120 bp baits was used to capture the s. mansoni exome  in the parents and the pools of treated and untreated male and female worms. the baits included  <dig>  in the nuclear genome and  <dig> in the mitochondrial genome. they covered  <dig> % of the s. mansoni exons  and accounted for  <dig> % of the exome length  but also included regions surrounding exons . no baits were designed for capture exons in gene families that could not be unambiguously mapped to a single location in the reference genome. the sequences covered by baits are referred to as the bait regions. each captured exon was covered by  <dig> baits.

the bait regions had an average read depth of  <dig> -  <dig> reads in the  <dig> libraries. the distribution of the read depth was similar between sexes except for parts of the z chromosome in the females in which read depth is reduced by half . these genome regions  correspond to the heterochromatin domain of the w chromosome   <cit>  and contain all the z-specific markers of the genetic map of s. mansoni   <cit> .table  <dig>

read depth of the bait regions for each sequenced library. each plot shows read depth of bait regions on the assembled chromosomes , on unplaced scaffolds that have been assigned to chromosomes or unassigned scaffolds . the black bars show the position of z-linked regions of the genome, which show approximately 50% reduction in read depth in female  compared with male  worms.



the statistics for each library indicate efficient exome capture . we captured > 99% of the genome covered by the baits in the aligned sequencing data . furthermore, this high capture efficiency was consistent across all six libraries, as well as on each chromosome and on the unassembled scaffold sets.

the mean sequence read depth declines with distance from the bait regions . mean read depth was reduced by ~70% at 100 bp, by ~50% at 250 bp, while at  <dig>  bp read depth declined to 20-40% of the initial read depth in the  <dig> libraries. therefore exome capture provides high read depth sequence for at least 250 bp surrounding bait regions. inclusion of the  <dig>  bp surrounding the bait regions accounted for  <dig> to 75% of the sequenced data. taking in account  <dig>  bp around the bait regions explained ~97% of the sequenced data. hence, in addition to the exons, we also captured adjacent genome regions containing promoters, transcription binding sites and other features of interest.table  <dig>

variant identification
we identified  <dig>  variants in the bait regions of the nuclear genome that were segregating between parents and the f <dig> progeny. this represents one variant every  <dig>  kb on average.  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were heterozygous  in male parent  and in female parent , respectively, suggesting elevated inbreeding in the male  parent. among the  <dig>  variants,  <dig>  were snps,  <dig> were insertions , and  <dig> were deletions .

x-qtl mapping: oxamniquine resistance qtl identification
we examined the differences in allele frequencies of each variant between treated and untreated worm pools across the exome to identify qtls involved in the oxa-resistance . to do this we plotted the p-values of the z-scores from the allele frequency comparison for both male and female worms at each variant across the bait regions. in addition, we examined the significance of the combined -scores from the comparisons of each sex.figure  <dig>

comparison of treated and untreated female pools shows  <dig> significant positions, while for treated and untreated male pools  <dig> positions were significant. both comparisons reveal strongly significant enrichment of alleles from the resistant parent at the end of chromosome  <dig>  in the female comparison, there were  <dig> significant positions between positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> . similarly, in the male comparison, there were  <dig> significant positions  between positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  the most significant peak observed in both male and female comparisons was position  <dig> , <dig> . this peak is  <dig>  kb away from the end of the causative gene  involved in oxamniquine resistance, which was recently identified by conventional linkage methods  <cit> . we also observed a second major region  that shows enrichment of alleles in both male and female comparisons. this scaffold accounts for  <dig> significant polymorphisms  in females and  <dig>  in males.

the remaining significant genome positions  were not consistent between the two comparisons. for example, a region on chromosome z at positions  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  accounted for  <dig> significant peaks only in females, while the other remaining  <dig> significant positions were found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and within unassigned scaffolds. in males only, a region of chromosome  <dig>  shows marginally significant values at  <dig> variants. the other remaining  <dig> significant positions were found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  z, and within unassigned scaffolds.

plotting the combined z-scores from the female and male strengthens the signal revealed in both male and female comparisons. of  <dig> significant positions genome-wide, chromosome  <dig> , accounts for  <dig> significant positions , including the most significant . the unassembled scaffold sc_ <dig> previously identified in both female and male mapping was confirmed in this combined mapping, with  <dig> significant positions . the other remaining  <dig> significant positions were found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  z, and within unassigned scaffolds.

discussion
efficiency of exome capture
capture was extremely efficient since more than 99% of the targeted regions were recovered and sequenced to high read depth in the six libraries  on two lanes of an illumina hiseq. furthermore, while the exome constitutes just 4% of the genome, between 32% to 77% of the capture sequences mapped to the bait regions. the exome bait sequences also captured adjacent non-coding dna, with sequence read depth dropping to 50% of mean exonic read depth 250 bp from the edge of bait regions, as commonly found in exome capture experiments with other organisms  <cit> . this is an added bonus for functional genomics applications as promoter polymorphisms and other regulatory sequences are often located within 250 bp of coding regions  <cit> . we also obtained low read depth of sequence from genome regions up to 50 kb distant from bait regions.

genotyping of modest numbers of microsatellite loci  is widely used for population genetics of schistosomes  <cit> . in this study we genotyped  <dig>  exonic snps  segregating in a single genetic cross. dense genotyping by exome sequencing will provide a powerful approach for population genomic analysis of schistosome populations. a complication of working with schistosome infections of humans is that adults are found in the blood vessels and only eggs can be collected from infected patients. however, exome sequencing of miracidia hatched from eggs should be possible following whole genome amplification  <cit> .

analysis of the relative read depth suggests that exome sequencing will be useful for analysis of copy number variation. males carry two z chromosomes while females carry only one z chromosome and a w chromosome  <cit> . z and w chromosomes share extensive regions of homology , but there are also z-linked regions that are present as a single copy in females and two copies in males. the presence of z-linked regions can be clearly inferred from the read depth plot in the sex chromosomes of males and females . these regions correspond exactly to those identified by lepesant et al. and carrying w specific sequences  <cit> , and also correspond to the positions of markers showing z-linked inheritance patterns in the cross used to construct the genetic map  <cit> .

validation of x-qtl for schistosoma mansoni
the x-qtl analysis successfully identified a region of chromosome  <dig> showing enrichment of alleles from the drug resistant parent in both male and female comparisons. this region contains the causative locus underlying resistance to this recessive trait  that was identified using classical linkage mapping  <cit> . the genome position showing the lowest p-value was 233 kb  from smp_ <dig>  this precision is extremely encouraging, given the small number of progeny in the pools. moreover, when comparing the lod scores obtained using the classical linkage mapping and the p-values obtained from the combined  scores used for x-qtl, the results are extremely similar .figure  <dig> 
comparison of the
p
-values from the x-qtl mapping and the lod scores from the classical mapping by valentim
et al.
. the lod scores are those obtained by the classical linkage mapping previously used to identify the qtl involved in the oxamniquine resistance and are superposed to the p-values from the combined  scores used for the present x-qtl mapping.



the x-qtl analysis also revealed another region linked to oxamniquine resistance. both female and male comparisons identified multiple positions  on an unassigned scaffold  showing significant peaks. we suggest two possible explanations. first, this scaffold could belong to the end of the chromosome  <dig>  adjacent to the major qtl peak identified. second, this scaffold could be positioned elsewhere in the genome and identify a second qtl region influencing resistance. we believe that the second explanation is very unlikely because the oxamniquine resistance trait shows a simple recessive inheritance  <cit>  and only a single qtl was identified by classical linkage mapping  <cit> .

the ability of this x-qtl study to correctly map the genome region underlying oxamniquine resistance is particularly remarkable given that two features of our experimental design were suboptimal. first, qtl is most powerful when large numbers of segregating progeny are examined  <cit> . however, in this experiment just  <dig> male worms survived drug treatment and were included in the treated male pool, while  <dig> treated females comprised the treated female pool. nevertheless, these small sample sizes were sufficient to reveal multiple highly significant variants within the known qtl region on chromosome  <dig>  second, we used whole genome amplification to generate sufficient amounts of initial dna for exome capture and library preparation, rather than directly using genomic dna. while whole genome amplification has been demonstrated to show high fidelity in s. mansoni
 <cit> , we expected that this procedure would add further experimental noise by reducing the precision of allele frequency estimation. in view of the efficiency of x-qtl to identify qtl regions for a simple mendelian trait under suboptimal conditions , we expect that this approach will be extremely powerful for investigating the basis of more complex traits, when experimental design is optimal .

we suggest that the small number of weakly significant peaks observed in regions outside the chromosome  <dig> qtl or scaffold sc_ <dig> are unlikely to impact oxa resistance. instead we believe these peaks result from the small size of the population samples from oxa-treated pools. we note that the pooled f <dig> progeny were constructed using  <dig> male and  <dig> female cercariae of each genotype. hence, while  <dig> male and  <dig> female adult worms were recovered from treated hamsters, the actual number of independent genotypes may have been lower than this . hence, our statistical correction of sampling effects may be insufficiently stringent. we suggest that future applications of x-qtl to schistosomes should focus on increasing the size of pools analyzed to minimize the impact of such sampling effects.

besides simplifying qtl identification for simple or complex traits, x-qtl may be the only suitable method for mapping some traits, such as host specificity or compatibility. schistosomes vary in ability to infect populations of host snails, and this variation has been shown to be heritable  <cit> . while crosses can be made between parasites utilizing different snail hosts, classical qtl mapping is problematic because f <dig> parasites that fail to develop in a particular host snail cannot be genotyped. this problem can be resolved by x-qtl analysis, because allele frequencies can be compared between emerging parasite pools from the two host snail populations to identify the genome region associated with specific development within each snail.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study extends the use of x-qtl methods to a multicellular parasite, the human blood fluke s. mansoni, and demonstrates the utility of this approach for a wide range of multicellular eukaryotes. the approach was validated by remapping a qtl for oxamniquine resistance, which was recently located using classical linkage mapping methods. this method opens the way for future qtl mapping of traits of biomedical or biological significance in schistosomes such as praziquantel resistance, host specificity, and virulence to both snail and vertebrate host. the study also demonstrates that exome capture constitutes a cost effective approach for genotyping in x-qtl studies. for s. mansoni, this approach reduced genome size by ~25-fold, thereby reducing sequencing costs, while maximizing read depth and thereby allowing accurate measurement of allele frequency within pooled samples.
