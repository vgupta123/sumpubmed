BACKGROUND
ecological processes are spatially influenced on various scales, ranging from global to local scales  <cit> . in natural communities, the observed spatial pattern is the result of environmental, biological and/or historical drivers  <cit> , which are not exclusive but rather complementary. the existence of spatial structures of species assemblages suggests the influence of at least one structuring factor: i) a spatially distributed environment is the driving force that structures species assemblages according to niche theory  <cit> ; ii) species are assembled on certain spatial scales through the influence of biotic interactions  <cit> ; and iii) historical contingency, according to neutral theory  <cit> , or stochastic variations in the history of species arrival  <cit>  drive this process, although the scale of the random effect has not been fully identified  <cit> . it is challenging to determine which process has a larger effect because historical species arrival data and past ecological processes are usually unknown.

when analyzing spatial datasets, striking and puzzling results are found if spatial autocorrelation is ignored because response variables are structured on various spatial scales  <cit> . specific spatially explicit sampling protocols for targeted organisms and different approaches are needed in soil ecology studies  <cit> , although these methods must be used with caution  <cit> . geostatistics  <cit>  allows the assessment of the spatial distribution of soil environmental variability and soil organisms  <cit> , but other powerful statistical tools are necessary to model spatial structures on various scales, such as principal coordinates of neighbor matrices   <cit> . the pcnm approach is part of the distance-based moran’s eigenvector map  analysis, which is included in the spatial eigenfunction family of tools  <cit>  and is a powerful statistical method to model spatial structures at all scales; in other words, the environmental variability is linked to community structure on a multi-scale level  <cit>  to obtain new ecological insights  <cit> . it has also been used to test and separate the niche from neutral mechanisms that influence the community structure  <cit> , although it may appear over-simplistic  <cit> .

to date, few field studies have been performed on the assembly of soil invertebrate communities to infer overall patterns and draw conclusions on the importance of explicitly accounting for multi-spatial scales. soil organism communities have been reported to be spatially structured due to their response to spatial variability in soil resources  <cit> , allowing the co-existence of competing species within the same patch in spatially heterogeneous environments  <cit> . although complex spatial patterns have been described for soil invertebrates forming patch assemblages that range from the scale of soil aggregates  <cit>  to those of individual plants  <cit> , agricultural lands and natural ecosystems  <cit> , no study has assessed the multi-scale spatial relationship between soil invertebrates and environmental variability thus far. the influence of disturbance and habitat heterogeneity on carabidae assemblages has been described recently, but only on the landscape scale  <cit> . studies and data analysis using these multi-spatial analysis techniques to perform invertebrate community research are needed, even if caution must also be exercised  <cit> . in this study, we aimed to i) analyze the spatial location of significant patches and gaps of the species assemblages identified, ii) test whether the relationship between species assemblages and soil environmental variability occurs on very fine , fine , and medium scales , and iii) investigate the spatial relationship between root traits and soil parameters to test the hypothesis of the “single tree effect”  <cit> .

cross-correlogram analysis
regarding the spatial cross-correlation between root-related variables and soil nutrient-related and physical variables, significant positive cross-correlations were identified at short lag distances  between the firl and soc0– <dig>  p0– <dig> and c:n5– <dig> , whereas p5– <dig> showed a significant negative cross-correlation . with regard to the corl, the cross-correlation at short distances was positive for soc5– <dig> and c:n5– <dig> and negative for n5– <dig> and p5– <dig>  regarding root biomass, the firw showed significant positive spatial cross-correlation with p0- <dig> and p5– <dig>  whereas it was negative for the variables soc5– <dig>  c:n0– <dig> and c:n5– <dig> at short lag distances . the corw showed a positive spatial relationship with soc5– <dig> and c:n5– <dig> and a negative relationship with p5– <dig>  a significant positive spatial cross-correlation was observed between the firl and soil aggregates of less than 5 mm in size, whereas it was negative for larger soil aggregates and moisture at short lag distances . regarding the firw, a significant negative spatial cross-correlation at short distances was especially observed for < <dig>  and 2–5 mm size soil aggregates, and a positive cross-correlation was observed for >10 mm aggregates and bulk density . finally, the corl showed a positive spatial cross-correlation with  <dig> - <dig>  and 1–5 mm soil aggregates and hydraulic conductivity, and a negative spatial cross-correlation was observed for >10 mm soil aggregates and soil moisture. the corw showed a positive spatial cross-correlation with  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> -5 mm size soil aggregates and a negative spatial cross-correlation for >10 mm soil aggregates .table  <dig>

decomposing multiple scale spatial patterns of species assemblages
significant multi-scale spatial structures were obtained for the earthworm community, species and assemblages, especially in the case of new genus  <dig>  the forward selection procedure resulted in various numbers of pcnm variables, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> out of  <dig> positively autocorrelated spatial eigenvectors . variogram modeling  <cit>  provided information on the scales of pcnm variables. the pcnm eigenfunctions selected to model the distribution of earthworm community are depicted in the additional file  <dig> 

these parameters indicate clear spatial structures on a medium , fine  and very fine scale , except for andiodrilus . regarding new genus  <dig>  pcnm <dig> and pcnm <dig> defined the medium-scale patterns, whereas pcnm <dig> and pcnm <dig> encompassed the fine-scale patterns; pcnm <dig>  pcnm <dig> and pcnm <dig> described very fine scales . the maps of the fitted scores of the significant canonical axes in the pcnm analysis for species , species assemblages and the whole community  are depicted in additional file  <dig> 

the significant explanatory environmental variables that best described the multi-spatial structure varied for the earthworm community, species and species assemblages . the nutrient-related variables explained much of the structure of new genus  <dig> on the medium and fine scales, whereas the physical variables were better explained on a very fine scale, such as soil compaction  and humidity . the variables c0– <dig>  and moisture content  contributed positively to the spatial structure model of new genus  <dig>  whereas c5– <dig> , n0– <dig> , c:n0– <dig>  and compaction  contributed negatively to medium-scale patterns .table  <dig>

with regard to the endogeic andiodrilus sp., the medium-scale spatial structure was explained by physical variables associated with the size of soil aggregates, although the values were not significant . when species assemblages were used instead, new environmental variables were detected , i.e., variable p0– <dig> was negatively correlated to the medium-scale pattern of assemblage of endogeics, and litter contributed negatively to this pattern. for the epigeics and anecic assemblage, litter and moisture contributed positively to the medium-scale spatial structure model, although this contribution was not significant .

soil environmental control on earthworm species and assemblage spatial patterns
the variation partitioning analysis revealed differences among species regarding the explanatory variables . the entire set of environmental and spatial variables explained the various percentages of variation within the community, species and species assemblage. in the case of the earthworm community, the explained variation was  <dig> %, of which  <dig> % was explained by the soil environment but not the spatial variables . the environment and fine-scale structure explained  <dig> % of the total variation, whereas the environment and medium-scale structure together explained  <dig> %. for the species alone, the ra <dig> coefficient for the environmental fraction ranged from 1% for aymara to  <dig> % for new genus  <dig>  the medium and fine spatial scales explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % for aymara and 2% and  <dig> % for new genus  <dig>  respectively. the amount of variation explained only by spatial variables independent of the environment differed among species; it ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for new genus  <dig> and aymara, respectively .table  <dig>

discussion
both spatial and environmental variables structured the species, assemblages and earthworm community, although variations were found in the explained contribution of environmental factors, i.e.,  <dig> % of the total variation of the global spatial structure of the earthworm community was explained by soil environmental variability. the specific soil environmental variables that were significantly linked to particular spatial scales for species and assemblages were also observed in other studies of nematodes in a forest  <cit> . to a certain extent, our results agree with hutchinson’s environmental control model  <cit> , although a large portion of the variation was also linked to a purely spatial component .

the selected pcnm variables highlighted significant spatial patterns in earthworm assemblages from a gallery forest, allowing us to identify the spatial scale at which the earthworm community was structured. in general, the very fine scale of autocorrelation detected in our study represents spatial patterns of less than 10 m , fine scales depicted patterns of 15–20 m , and medium scales  represented spatial patterns of >30 m . furthermore, our observation of very fine-, fine- and medium-scale spatial relationships indicates the importance of considering multiple scales during ecological studies of soil organisms. in our study, we carefully chose the scale used to sample earthworms to focus on small-scale patterns. additional studies are needed to increase the scale of the sampling design, i.e., hundreds of meters to several kilometres.

the influence of environmental constraints on the spatial distribution of species assemblages has previously been demonstrated in a nearby savanna  <cit> . moreover, earthworm activity also contributes to soil heterogeneity  <cit> . the joint influence of the soil environment and species-created heterogeneity, i.e., the so-called “functional domain”  <cit>  of soil parameters, could explain the spatial patterns observed on several scales. on very fine scales, the environmental variables associated with the spatial distribution of earthworms were more difficult to detect, i.e., the concentration of soil c0– <dig> and moisture better explained the spatial pattern of new genus  <dig> on fine and medium scales compared with very fine scales, whereas andiodrilus sp. was mostly associated with physical variables, such as size class aggregated distributions, because this medium-size species produces compact casts that influence the surrounding soil environment  <cit> . very fine scales  may be overlooked by classical multivariate analyses, as their relationships may be masked by those of other explanatory variables associated with larger scales, such as pcnm  <dig>  as a detailed analysis of the soil environmental variables was performed within a relatively small area, some of the variation could be attributed to unmeasured variables, leading to incomplete predictions  <cit> . moreover, the fraction attributed solely to space was smaller than all other fractions, except for aymara , glossodrilus , and assemblages epigeics + anecic and andiodrilus, aymara and new genus  <dig>  which represented  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variance, respectively.

the factors affecting the spatial distribution of soil organisms at larger scales include gradients in soil organic matter and vegetation structure  <cit> , whereas at very fine scales  earthworm spatial distribution could be influenced by local factors, such as the plant characteristics, soil moisture and micro-topography. a variety of plant species is likely to support important levels of soil heterogeneity  <cit> . the root architecture or fine-scale spatial patterns within the plant community determine the spatial structures of earthworm populations through fine-scale soil environmental variations, which is known as the “single-tree effect”  <cit> . through litter input and root leachates, trees directly influence earthworm populations. they also indirectly influence earthworm populations by altering the soil properties, forming patches beneath tree canopies that influence community structure and ecosystem function  <cit> . species exclusion was also reported for the savanna grass imperata brasiliensis, as earthworms become injured upon contact with its sharp-pointed roots  <cit> . in our study, significant positive cross-correlations were found for the corl and corw and the soil nutrient- and physical-related variables. these close associations between soil variables and vegetation structure have also been described for epigeic invertebrate assemblages  <cit> . regarding the importance of soil environmental variables, it should be noted that the influential factors according to our analyses did not operate independently but interacted ; these complex interactions are characteristic of most ecological systems  <cit> .

the idea that species distributions can be linked to key abiotic variables on multiple scales is not new  <cit> . our analysis for empirical data has shown that environmental variables are indeed most important on broad scales, whereas purely spatial patterns appear to dominate on finer scales  <cit> . applying pcnm analysis toward large-scale assessment of species-environment relationships is a well-established method  <cit> . gilbert and bennett  <cit>  and smith and lundholm  <cit>  criticized the application of variation partitioning to study the relationship between environmental variables and space, although they admitted that it yields useful results when carefully used. our present analysis supports an optimistic view of this approach. all environmental patterns are spatially correlated on some scale  <cit> , and all ecological processes are spatial to some extent  <cit> . the common fraction of variance explained jointly by environment and space appears to represent patterns generated by both environmental factors and the limitations on species dispersal  <cit> . in our study, the highest level of pure spatial variation was obtained for the epigeics + anecic assemblage , whereas the endogeics assemblage showed the lowest level . species, or even earthworm ecological categories, show specific dispersal behaviors  <cit> , with endogeics typically showing less dispersal than do epigeic and anecic species.

we carefully selected the sampling scale and the spatial statistics tools to address the ecological question at hand  <cit> . we benefited from our previous knowledge regarding the biology and ecology of the species found in the region where the survey was undertaken  <cit> . our study lays the groundwork for further detailed analysis of spatial structuring environmental factors and species assemblages on several scales, while also providing clues for developing an accurate and spatially explicit sampling design for earthworm communities. in addition, the utility of the tools used to select species assemblages and analyze their spatial attributes relative to the soil environmental variability was clearly demonstrated. we are confident that our results provide crucial insight into the spatial relationship between species assemblages and soil environmental variability on scales that range several tens of meters. the selection of assemblages from the correspondence analysis, in this case epigeics versus endogeics, and the statistical methods used to draw our conclusions provide insights that improve understanding regarding why particular species assemblages are found at particular sites. from an ecological point of view, our study not only suggests that specific environmental factors determine the structure and spatial distribution of earthworms in the gallery forest but also indicates that a large proportion of unexplained variation exists. whether this variation is the result of unmeasured soil environmental variables or null model  patterns is a subject for further research.

CONCLUSIONS
earthworms were spatially structured within a relatively small but highly heterogeneous plot; i.e., even at ranges of just a few meters, a multi-scale spatial pattern was observed. the amount of variation jointly explained by the environment and space was not high. however, these sources of variation should not be neglected because they represent unmeasured soil environmental factors and processes that limit species dispersal. further studies are needed because dispersal traits, for example, remain largely unknown in many earthworm communities. in conclusion, specific abiotic factors were responsible for the observed patterns, and the importance of these patterns needs to be elucidated, even if the multi-scale approach carries additional difficulties and caveats when interpreting the results.
