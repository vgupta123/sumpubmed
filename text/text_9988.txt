BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is an economically important viral disease that is easily transmitted through direct contact to susceptible pigs and vertically to foetuses. the disease is also known as mystery swine disease, blue ear disease, porcine endemic abortion & respiratory syndrome  and swine infertility respiratory syndrome   <cit> . it is known as one of the most expensive disease of modern swine production. a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  outbreak can devastate a herd and determining the origin of the virus can be impossible. prrs is characterized by an acute viral infection of the porcine macrophage that leads to an immunologically altered state. in extreme cases, respiratory distress, metabolic dysregulation and neuronal involvement result in significant mortality within days to weeks of experimental inoculation with highly pathogenic isolates . the virus can also reappear in farms that have taken great lengths to eliminate the virus. endemic disease from emerging and re-emerging prrsv results in estimated annual economic losses and the virus is estimated to cost the industry over  <dig> million usd, or  <dig>  million usd per day in the u.s. economy alone  <cit> .

since its emergence, much has been studied and learned about the virus. it was first detected in north america and reported in  <dig>  <cit> . the virus was then subsequently isolated in europe in  <dig>  <cit> . since then it has spread rapidly to asia and throughout the world. the porcine reproductive & respiratory syndrome virus , the causative agent for the syndrome, is a positive-sense single stranded rna virus, belonging to the family arteriviridae of the order nidovirales, and genus arterivirus  <cit> .

the prrsv genome organization is similar to other arterivirus and is approximately  <dig> kilobases in length. there are  <dig> open reading frames , orf1a and orf1b encoding polyproteins that are processed into  <dig> non-structural proteins  by viral proteases within the virus genome  <cit> . the glycosylated membrane associated minor structural proteins gp , gp <dig> and gp <dig>  respectively are encoded by orf2a, orf <dig> and orf <dig>  <cit> . orf2b encodes 2b protein, a non-glycosylated structural protein which is virion associated and the principal product of orf <dig>  <cit> . three major structural proteins, gp <dig>  m and n protein within the virus genome are encoded by orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  respectively. gp5a, which is referred to as orf5a protein, is a novel structural protein encoded by an alternative orf of the subgenomic mrna encoding gp <dig> and is incorporated into the virion  <cit> .

based on genetic characterization, there exist two related but antigenically and genetically distinguishable major genotypes with over 50% rna sequence variation; the european strain  representing the viruses predominating in europe and the north american strain  originally and mostly found in north america  <cit> . both genotypes have been described to be evolving independently in europe and north america and the co-existence of both genotypes has been increasingly evident in several countries, including malaysia, thailand, korea and china . most recently, a variant of genotype  <dig> also known as highly pathogenic strain of prrsv, genetically characterized by a unique discontinuous deletion of  <dig> amino acids  in the non structural protein  of the north american strains was confirmed by the office international des epizooties  and the food and agricultural organization  as the causative agent for the severe “high fever” disease designated as the highly pathogenic strain of prrsv in asia. because of its economic significance, a great deal of resource has been invested to research the virus and in developing effective prevention and control strategies. but protocols providing consistent success have been elusive due to the high rate of genetic change and antigenic variability .

situation in south east asia
throughout asia, prrs outbreaks were reported in many countries between the late 1980s and early 1990s  <cit> . the highly pathogenic prrs  which emerged in china in  <dig> has spread to south east asian countries since  <dig>  <cit> . the highly pathogenic prrs was reported in vietnam in march  <dig>  <cit> , laos in june  <dig>  <cit> , thailand in  <dig>  <cit> , myanmar in february  <dig>  <cit> , cambodia in august  <dig>  <cit> , philippines in august  <dig>  <cit> . transboundary spread of hp-prrsv from southern china to south east asia suggests that biosecurity failures have occurred, including failure to control animal movements and trading among neighboring countries at borders  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> is malaysia at risk of hp-prrsv? since the disease started in china, it has quickly spread to the surrounding countries in south east asia. malaysia is constantly at risk and threat after thailand reported its first hp-prrs in 2010




situation in malaysia
in malaysia, a syndrome very similar to prrsv has been recorded in various pig farms as early as  <dig>  <cit> . a serological survey done in about  <dig> farms in major pig rearing states in the country showed that the pigs found in  <dig> out of the  <dig> farms had serological evidence of infection. subsequently a study done in  <dig> showed that 94% of the farms and  <dig> % of the pigs were tested positive for prrsv antibodies  <cit> . in  <dig>  another local study documented  <dig> % sero-prevalence out of  <dig> sera collected from  <dig> non-prrs vaccinated farms in  <dig> states. in the same study,  <dig> tissue samples were collected from  <dig> farms  <cit> . twelve of the tissue samples were positive for prrsv with all positive for us strains in the selected pig farms. the study concluded that there are more us strains in the selected pig farms, however, it should be noted that there were limitations as the number of samples studied were too small. in  <dig>  another study conducted in malaysia concluded that both eu and na strains are present in malaysian  <cit> .

farming situation in malaysia
there is approximately  <dig> farms in malaysia with  <dig> farms in west malaysia with an approximate total no of sows of  <dig>  million of which  <dig>  million is located in west malaysia. the estimated total ex farm value of the swine industry in malaysia is around  <dig>  billion ringgit. similar to the farming situation in other countries, the farming industry in malaysia has moved on from backyard to industrialized farming systems, with many small farms that has shut down; merged or bought over by bigger players in the industry which explains the reason for the number of farms that have reduced but the farm sizes that are increasing. the farms are mostly open house, farrow to finish and single site, about 10% of the farms use closed house system. the swine respiratory health status varies from state to state and from farm to farm as well. selangor  and penang  are highly urbanized states with limited land space; therefore the farms are close to each other. johor —these farms used to export to singapore and are more established. perak is located between central and north malaysia which used to be a mining area; the pig farms are located next to lakes and ponds. sabah and sarawak which is located in east malaysia have more land and space, thus, in theory there are less issues.

current study
between 2013– <dig>   <dig> diagnostic cases were received for diagnostic investigation. seven out of  <dig> cases received were positive. six out of the seven cases were positive for na strain while one case was positive for both eu and na strain. among all those cases that were received, there were two atypical cases observed in  <dig> and subsequently in  <dig> in which high mortality rates were observed in the farm.

case 1: location: east malaysia; year: 2013
history & clinical signs
from november through december of  <dig>  high mortality was observed in a pig farm in east malaysia with its return/repeat service increasing by 30%. the piglets were weak and runt. it was also evident that the disease was spreading along to pig farms located in close proximity. about 2– <dig> months later, there were occurrence of problems in weaners showing signs of edema and classical swine fever virus and other bacterial infections. at that point, veterinarians were called to assist to collect samples and investigate the disease. upon tracing back the case history and through differential diagnosis, there were adequate reasons to suspect the case as a potential high fever prrsv .fig.  <dig> case  <dig>  east malaysia. a, b, c, d: at the time of sample collection, the case looked like edema and the animals had secondary bacterial infections. e, f: the virus had spread to the neighbouring farms and showed similar clinical signs. 3 days old piglets looked weak, runt and emaciated




case 2: location: central malaysia, year: 2014
history & clinical signs
in february  <dig>  a farrow-finish  <dig> sow herd reported an outbreak of late-term abortion, 30% of repeat to estrus, and more than 50% of pre-weaning mortality. the sow herd had been regularly vaccinated with aujeszky’s vaccine, swine fever and prrs mlv. mortality of grower & finisher were increased with porcine respiratory disease complex. one week after a schedule blanket vaccination in sow herd with prrs mlv, there were more than 50% of gilt and first parity sow where sudden death near to term with hyperemia and pyrexia, and 20% of late-term abortion. umbilical hemorrhage was observed in some cases. piglet showed ill thrift with periocular oedema and conjunctivitis. weaners exhibited dyspnea and lethargy and mortality rose to more than 80% .fig.  <dig> case  <dig>  central malaysia. a and b: the piglets are weak, runt and chilled. they are clustering together to stay warm. c: sudden death detected in sow with hyperemia and pyrexic

fig.  <dig> molecular phylogenetic analysis of the orf <dig> gene of case  <dig>  & case  <dig>  from east malaysia




in this current study, we compare the orf <dig> and orf <dig> gene sequence from malaysia with the orf <dig> and orf <dig> gene isolates from other asian countries to study the diversity of prrsv in malaysia which may help shed some light on the potential origin of prrsvs in malaysia. orf <dig> encodes the major viral envelope glycoprotein , which is located on the surface of the virion. gp <dig> plays an important role in viral infectivity and contains important immunological domains associated with viral neutralization  <cit> . several peptide/protein motifs, such as signal peptides, trans-membrane regions, antigenic determinants and glycosylation sites have been widely used for analyzing genetic variation and the molecular epidemiology of prrsv. the orf <dig> encodes the nucleocapsid protein, the most abundant viral protein in virus-infected cells and the most immunodominant antigen in the pig immune response to prrsv. orf <dig> is, therefore a promising candidate for detection and diagnosis  <cit> .

RESULTS
analysis of the nsp <dig> gene of case  <dig> and case 2
after various attempts and optimization strategies, the team did not manage to obtain any positive bands from case  <dig> and case  <dig> for the nsp <dig> gene despite getting a positive band from positive controls. it is highly suspected that the nsp <dig> regions of both cases are highly mutated and not amplifiable with known published primers that are readily available. the nsp <dig> of prrsv is a multi-domain protein that has been shown to undergo remarkable genetic variation. from its three major domains , nsp <dig> is the most divergent protein between prrsv types  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and also between the pathogenic prrsv 16244b and an attenuated vaccine and its parental strain vr <dig> . a large amount of data supports the theory that the middle section of the nsp <dig> protein is highly susceptible to mutation and tolerant to insertions and deletions, regardless of the pathogenic phenotype of the isolates . in fact, reverse genetics experiments have mapped several non-essential viral replication regions in nsp <dig>  including a large deletion of  <dig> nucleotides in the middle region of the gene  <cit> .

analysis of the orf <dig> gene  of case  <dig>  from east malaysia
blast analysis of the orf <dig> sequence derived from case  <dig>  from east malaysia  on genbank showed that the sequence had high similarities to prrsv sequences from china , south korea  and usa . based on the phylogenetic study, the orf <dig> gene sequence derived from case  <dig>  from east malaysia  clustered together with the orf <dig> gene sequences pl97- <dig> from south korea , 4034-2-v- <dig> from south korea , md- <dig> from taiwan  and respprrs mlv , mlv respprrs af <dig> and atcc vr- <dig> u <dig> , the parent strain of the vaccine ingelvac prrs mlv. the sequence comparison showed that the nucleotide sequence of the orf <dig> gene derived from case  <dig>  from east malaysia  had  <dig> % nucleotide sequence homology with respprrs mlv  and respprrs mlv , 99% nucleotide sequence homology with atcc vr- <dig>  the parent strain of the vaccine ingelvac prrs mlv and 98% nucleotide sequence homology with 4034-2-v- <dig>  from south korea.

analysis of the orf <dig> gene  of case  <dig>  from east malaysia
blast analysis on genbank shows that the orf <dig> gene sequence  of case  <dig> from east malaysia derived in this study is highly similar to prrsv strain jn-hs from shandong, china,  <dig> . further analysis by phylogenetic tree studying only selected sequences of the orf <dig> gene  of case  <dig>  from east malaysia with other highly similar sequences from genbank showed that it clustered with sequences from china , vietnam  and laos . the phylogenetic tree also suggest that the orf <dig> gene  of case  <dig>  from east malaysia is a derivative of jx-ai from jiangxi, china  which is a representative strain of highly pathogenic prrsv in china since  <dig>  the sequence comparison of the nucleotide sequence of orf <dig> gene  of case  <dig>  from east malaysia showed  <dig> % sequence homology to to jn-hs from china,  <dig> % sequence homology to jx-a <dig> from jiangxi, china and  <dig> % sequence homology to these sequences from china , vietnam  and laos . the high genetic similarity between case  <dig>  and jx-a <dig>  suggest that case  <dig>  from east malaysia may be potentially a first hp-prrsv found in malaysia. multiple mismatched amino acid changes were observed in position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> throughout the orf <dig> gene of case  <dig>  from east malaysia in  comparison to atcc vr- <dig> .

analysis of the orf <dig> gene  of case  <dig>  from central malaysia
blast analysis on genbank showed that the orf <dig> gene sequence derived in this study was highly similar to prrsv isolate shizuoka from japan  and other isolates from america . one of the sequence that is highly similar to the orf <dig> gene of case  <dig>  from central malaysia is a synthetic contruct clone of prrsv. based on the phylogenetic study, the orf <dig> gene sequence derived from this study clustered together with the orf <dig> gene sequences from taiwan , south korea ; respprrs mlv , mlv respprrs af <dig> and atcc vr- <dig> u <dig> , the parent strain of the vaccine ingelvac prrs mlv. sequences for constructing the phylogenetic tree were selected based on genetic relatedness and completeness of sequences that were available on genbank. the sequence comparison demonstrated that the nucleotide sequence of orf <dig> gene derived from case  <dig> , central malaysia  has  <dig> % sequence homology with sequence md- <dig>  from taiwan. the sequence homology of the orf <dig> gene from case  <dig> , central malaysia  with the vaccine strains were relatively lower than expected with  <dig> % with respprrs mlv ,  <dig> % with mlv respprrs af <dig> and 86% with atcc vr- <dig> u <dig> , the parent strain of the vaccine ingelvac prrs mlv. this is not surprising as it has been documented that prrsv strains differ in virulence  and vary genetically  suggesting that the orf <dig> gene derived from case  <dig> , central malaysia  may be a derivative of the ingelvac prrs mlv vaccine, a possible recombinant of the vaccine virus and a wild-type virus, or a truly wild-type virus that is partially homologous to the original parent vaccine strain, vr <dig>  which may be still circulating in the field  <cit> .

as expected that the orf <dig> that encodes for the major envelope glycoprotein would have a high degree of mutation as it is known to be the most variable region  <cit> , multiple mismatched amino acids were observed throughout the orf <dig> gene of case  <dig> , central malaysia  in comparison to atcc vr- <dig>  .

analysis of the orf <dig> gene  of case  <dig>  from central malaysia
blast analysis on genbank of the orf <dig> gene sequence from case  <dig> , central malaysia  derived in this study demonstrates high similarity to prrsv strains from south korea, china, denmark and usa. further analysis by phylogenetic tree studying only selected sequences of the orf <dig> gene with other highly similar sequences from genbank suggest that the ancestor for the sequence from this study is atccvr <dig> which is the parent strain to ingelvac prrs mlv vaccine . the phylogenetic tree also suggest that the orf <dig> gene sequence derived from this study groups closely with other sequences from genbank such as v7-ha-myc , respprrs mlv , rvrp <dig> , fjsd , dk-2004-1-7-pi , dk-1997-19407b , yn- <dig> , pmlv/mn184-3utr  and pmlv/mn184orf5- <dig> ; two of which are chimeric infectious porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type  <dig> clone representing a background of strain ingelvac prrs mlv and 3′utr of mn <dig>  the sequence comparison confirmed that the nucleotide sequence of orf <dig> gene derived from this study is  <dig> % similar to atcc vr- <dig> which is the parent strain to ingelvac prrs mlv vaccine and has 100% similarity to other sequences as listed in table 1; two of which are chimeric infectious prrsv pmlv/mn184-3′utr fj <dig> & pmlv/mn184-3′utr fj <dig>  three mismatched amino acid changes were observed in position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> throughout the orf <dig> gene of case  <dig> , central malaysia  in comparison to atcc vr- <dig>  . at first glance, the four sequences derived from these two cases display a vast diversity in terms of geographical origin of the prrs virus found in malaysia. however, when looked closely, all four sequences seem to have one thing in common, they display high sequence homology to the modified live vaccine virus strain regardless of which geographical location the sequences are highly similar to.table  <dig> prrsv isolates derived from this study and other isolates reported previously used for comparison and constructing the phylogenetic tree in this study

both cases displayed a high degree of mutation in both genes, orf <dig> and orf <dig>  there are several possibilities that the orf <dig> and orf <dig> genes from case  <dig>  and case  <dig>  are derivatives of the ingelvac prrs mlv vaccine, a possible recombinant of the vaccine virus and a wild-type virus, or a truly wild-type virus that is highly homologous to the original parent vaccine strain, vr  <dig>  this theory was discussed by opriessnig in  <dig>  <cit> .

further to that, it has been reported that the use of synthetic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus strain confers unprecedented levels of heterologous protection because current vaccines do not provide sufficient levels of protection against divergent prrsv strains circulating in the field, mainly due to the substantial variation of the viral genome  <cit> . however, based on the phylogenetic study and sequence comparison, our study suggest that these synthetic chimeric infectious prrsv constructs are highly similar to the prrsv that are causing high mortality rate in the farm in case  <dig>  in central malaysia. therefore, it is apparent that the rapid rate of prrsv gene mutation remains a huge challenge for the practicality of such synthetic clone vaccines.

CONCLUSIONS
over the years, there have been biased and mixed reports of the presence of prrsv in malaysia. based on a collection of studies, it can be confirmed that both european and north american strains are present in malaysia. however, over the years there have been more north american strains reported compared to european strains. despite global and intensive use of mlv vaccine, repeated prrs outbreaks continue due to constant genetic changes in field isolates. rapid evolution due to high mutation rate has led to new generations of genetically and antigenically variable virus strains in the field. vaccine strains or derivatives of vaccine strains may also induce disease in the field and persist in vaccinated pigs and spread to non-vaccinated pigs contributing to prrsv virulence in the field and the inability for effective vaccination. as reported by many other researchers in other countries  <cit> , the results from this study suggest that the virus that persisted in both farms is a product of a recombination event between vaccine strains and field isolates. for future studies, genetic and evolutionary analyses of full length genomes are important to delineate the degree of homology among prrsvs and for effective vaccine design. we are unable to confirm the presence of highly pathogenic prrsv in malaysia. the high degree of nucleotide homology between the local malaysian isolates with representative strains of highly pathogenic prrsv strains from china suggest that a derivative of the highly pathogenic virus strain may be present in malaysia.
