BACKGROUND
a large proportion of breast cancer patients are postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive  tumors. after menopause, the main source of circulating estrogens are extragonadal sites, such as liver, skin, muscle and adipose tissue  <cit> . recent advances in treatment strategies, that inhibit the action of estrogen, have greatly improved the range of effective therapeutic options for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. in fact, hormonal therapies have shown to be important tools in treating er-positive breast cancer and during the last two decades, tamoxifen, which blocks the action of estrogen via the er, has been considered the gold standard therapeutic option  <cit> . however, extensive evaluation of tamoxifen treatment revealed adverse effects such as endometrial cancer and blood clots. in addition, many er-positive breast cancers do not respond to this therapeutic and resistance to tamoxifen often develops during treatment, leading to disease recurrence  <cit> . to circumvent these drawbacks the use of third-generation aromatase inhibitors , which prevent estrogen biosynthesis, is an effective alternative hormonal therapy and clinical guidelines are now embracing ais as appropriate adjuvant therapy for hormone-sensitive early breast cancer  <cit> . these compounds have demonstrated superior efficacy, reduced incidence of endometrial cancer and blood clot formation when compared to tamoxifen. moreover, ais have also improved disease-free survival in a variety of adjuvant settings for early breast cancer  <cit> . steroidal and non-steroidal ais cause an effective suppression of estrogen synthesis  <cit> . the former, such as exemestane and formestane, compete with the endogenous ligands, androstenedione and testosterone, for the active site of the aromatase and are converted to intermediates that bind irreversibly to the enzyme active site. non-steroidal ais, like letrozole and anastrazole, bind reversibly to the enzyme active site, competing with the substrate of aromatase. despite the success of the third-generation steroidal and nonsteroidal ais, they also induce increased bone loss, which may heighten the risk for osteoporotic fractures and bone pain. in that way, it is essential to search for other potent and specific molecules with lower side effects. moreover, it is of critical importance for the management of breast cancer treatment to understand the pathways involved in the regression of breast tumors by ais.

for many years, research in the field of endocrine-mediated breast cancer has focused on the proliferative effects of estrogens. however, recent work has also demonstrated a role for these steroidal hormones in the regulation of apoptosis in neoplastic mammary tissue and in breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been reported that estrogen stimulates the growth of breast cancer expressing functional ers  <cit> , by affecting cell cycle machinery  <cit>  and inducing expression of specific growth factors and their receptors  <cit> . it has been reported that estradiol deprivation  <cit>  or treatments with selective estrogen receptor modulators   <cit> , antagonists of estrogen receptor  <cit>  or aromatase inhibitors  <cit>  induce inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. treatment of breast cancer using these endocrine strategies may induce cell death by altered expression of bcl- <dig> family proteins, altered expression of cell cycle associated proteins  <cit>  or by other mechanisms.

new synthetic ais obtained by modifications in the a and d- rings of the natural substrate of aromatase, androstenedione were developed and tested in our laboratory, for aromatase inhibition in placental microsomes. two of the compounds synthesized, the 5α-androst-3-en-17-one  and the 3α ,4α-epoxy-5α-androstan-17-one  , have shown to be strong inhibitors of aromatase  <cit> . in the present study, we have investigated the effects of these two steroidal aromatase inhibitors on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and induction of cell death, using the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line stably transfected with the aromatase gene, mcf-7aro.

RESULTS
morphological studies
in order to investigate the morphological changes induced by inhibitors 3a and 4a in mcf-7aro cells, cells were cultured with or without the compounds and examined by phase contrast microscopy . the untreated control cells  did not show any morphological alterations during the different incubation periods. after  <dig> hr incubation with the different concentrations of the two inhibitors no significant differences in cell and nuclear morphology were observed. however, after  <dig> and  <dig> days, mcf-7aro cells treated with compounds 3a and 4a showed marked morphological alterations. in treated mcf-7aro cells we could observe non-adherent round cells, showing membrane blebbing, as well as adherent cells characterized by the presence of perinuclear vesicles in the cytoplasm . when exposed to the higher doses of the compounds, an increased number of these vesicles were observed in the cells. additionally, wright and hoechst  <dig> staining  confirmed the cellular changes upon treatment with the compounds. treatment of mcf-7aro cells with higher concentrations of 3a and 4a  resulted in dramatic alterations in cellular morphology with condensed marginalized chromatin and vacuolization of the cytoplasm.

cell viability and cell proliferation
a significant dose- and time-dependent reduction in cell number was observed when cells were incubated with compounds 3a and 4a. cell viability was evaluated by flow cytometry using 7aad- fluorescence. 7aad-ve cells were considered as viable cells. treatment of mcf-7aro cells with compound 3a for  <dig> hr, resulted in a reduced number of 7aad-ve cells:  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm, whereas compound 4a reduced cell viability in  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm, in comparison to the control . to address the direct effect of aromatase inhibitors 3a and 4a on the proliferation of mcf-7aro cells, thymidine incorporation assays were performed. for this purpose, exponentially growing cells were treated with different concentrations  of the inhibitors, 3a and 4a, for 1– <dig> days. as shown in figure  <dig>  these compounds inhibited mcf-7aro cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. the time-response profile obtained for both inhibitors showed a biphasic effect in dna synthesis of mcf-7aro cells. at short exposure times, compounds 3a and 4a stimulated dna synthesis of mcf-7aro cells. in fact, after  <dig> hr incubation, compound 3a induced  <dig> ± 20%,  <dig> ± 7% and  <dig> ± 13% and compound 4a induced  <dig> ± 14%,  <dig> ± 6% and  <dig> ± 17% increase in dna synthesis, respectively for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm, considering the control as 100%. for  <dig> hr incubation of mcf-7aro cells with 3a and 4a at  <dig> μm, a slight decrease in thymidine incorporation was observed. after this period, when cells were treated for  <dig> and  <dig> days with these compounds, the stimulatory effect was replaced by a decrease on dna synthesis. long-term exposure of mcf-7aro to 3a and 4a at the concentration range used resulted in an effective inhibitory effect on dna synthesis. for instance, after  <dig> days of incubation, compound 3a resulted in  <dig> ± 8%,  <dig> ± 10%,  <dig> ± 2% and  <dig> ± 3% and compound 4a in  <dig> ± 5%,  <dig> ± 5%,  <dig> ± 3% and  <dig>  ± 2% decrease in thymidine incorporation respectively for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm. so compound 4a showed to be slightly more effective in inhibiting mcf-7aro cell proliferation than 3a.

cell cycle analysis
to investigate the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative effect of compounds 3a and 4a in mcf-7aro cells, discrimination of cells in g0/g <dig> versus s and g2/m phases of cell cycle was carried out by measuring dna content by flow cytometry. cells were treated with different concentrations of these two compounds and stained, after  <dig> hr, with pi. mcf-7aro cells deprived of hormones showed  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of cells in g0/g <dig> phase, whereas in testosterone-induced growth of mcf-7aro cells , the percentage of cells arrested in g0/g <dig> phase was only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, which indicates that aromatase present in mcf-7aro is converting testosterone into estradiol, inducing in that way cell proliferation. the cell cycle profile of mcf-7aro cells treated with 3a or 4a was similar . each treatment clearly increased the percentage of mcf-7aro cells in g0/g <dig> phase and reduced the fraction of cells in s and g2/m cell cycle phases . in response to treatment with 3a, a dose-dependent accumulation of cells in g0/g <dig> phase was observed:  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the control . like steroid 3a, compound 4a presented a dose-dependent increase in the cell percentage in g0/g1:  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm . the same pattern of steroidal ais effect on cell cycle progression were also observed after  <dig> days of treatment however no statistically significant differences was found.

cells were treated with different concentrations of the compounds for  <dig> hr. treated cells were harvested, fixed and their dna content was evaluated by pi labelling followed by flow cytometry analysis. data are presented as single cell events in g0–g <dig>  s and the g2-m phases of the cell cycle. the data represents means and se of triplicates and are representative of three independent experiments. significant differences between the control  and medium containing  <dig> nm t are indicated by * ; medium containing  <dig> nm t vs medium containing different steroid concentrations are indicated as φ , **  and θ.

analysis of cell death
as shown previously , incubation of mcf-7aro cells with compounds 3a and 4a caused alterations in cell morphology, such as membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation/marginalization and appearance of perinuclear vesicles in the cytoplasm. in order to investigate the type of cell death induced by these compounds, features associated with apoptosis or autophagic cell death were assessed. for apoptosis, plasma membrane changes such as phosphatidylserine  residues in the outer surface of the plasma membrane were evaluated by annexin v-pe apoptosis detection kit. staining with annexin v-pe was performed in association with a vital dye 7-amino-acitomycin , to allow the identification of viable, early apoptotic and late apoptotic or necrotic cells. untreated mcf-7aro cells presented  <dig> % binding to annexin v , whereas cells treated with 3a at  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm showed  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. inhibitor 4a induced an increased binding to annexin v of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively for  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm in comparison to the control . caspases-3/ <dig> activity was evaluated, but no changes were observed  for both compounds at different incubation periods .

in order to clarify the nature of the cytoplasmic structures observed in the treated cells , the auto-fluorescent substance mdc, a dye for autophagic vacuoles, was used. in cells treated with compounds 3a or 4a , mdc-labelled autophagic vacuoles appeared as distinct dot-like structures distributed in the cytoplasm or in the perinuclear regions whereas in the untreated cells, there was a homogeneous distribution of mdc . after  <dig> days, ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that the compounds induced an apoptotic-like nuclear morphology characterized by a partially condensed chromatin marginalized along the nuclear envelope . in addition, the cells presented giant autophagosomes distributed throughout the cytoplasm containing cytoplasmatic fragments and mitochondria.

discussion
estrogens promote cell proliferation in normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells, activating hormone-responsive genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle. studies have shown that anti-estrogenic treatment or estrogen deprivation prevents mcf- <dig> cells to enter the s and g2/m phase  <cit> . in addition to cell cycle progression, estrogens are known to protect cells against cell death by apoptosis. several studies both in vitro and in vivo have reported that estrogen withdrawal  <cit>  and treatment with either tamoxifen  <cit> , faslodex  <cit>  and some ais  <cit>  induce apoptosis of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. anti-hormonal treatments of breast cancer are therefore central in regard to their potent inhibitory effects in hormone-induced cell growth.

this study explored the in vitro effects of compounds 3a and 4a in mcf-7aro cell growth, cell cycle progression and induction of cell death. in this system, mcf-7aro breast cancer cell line expressed sufficient aromatase activity in order to stimulate cell growth via aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. in fact, this androgen significantly stimulated mcf-7aro cells growth at concentrations as low as  <dig> nm, which is within the physiological concentration range for this steroid hormone. in the present work, we showed that compounds 3a and 4a, which have previously demonstrated to efficiently inhibit aromatase in placental microsomes  <cit>  and in different cell lines  <cit> , have also the ability to inhibit the proliferative action of testosterone in mcf-7aro cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. this indicates that aromatization of the androgen with production of e <dig> was responsible for the testosterone-mediated cell growth. however, at  <dig> hr incubation, this effect was not observed. indeed, inhibitors 3a and 4a induced stimulation of dna synthesis, which might be due to estrogenic-like effects. a similar pattern of cell proliferation has been described for other compounds  <cit> . when assessing cell cycle it was found an increase in g0/g <dig> and a decrease in s and g2/m phases. we demonstrated that both aromatase inhibitors induce growth arrest of mcf-7aro cells by blocking the g1/s phase transition of cell cycle or a prolonged transit time in g <dig>  preventing cells to enter s phase, which subsequently led to a decrease in the percentage of cells in s and g2/m phase. moreover, thymidine incorporation results together with the fraction of cells in s phase suggest that cell proliferation may continue though with a reduction in growth rate. analysis of cell cycle suggests that the mechanisms of action of both compounds are identical. these results are in accordance to a previous study  <cit>  in which similar effects were induced by other ais, like letrozole , anastrozole , and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione , in the cell cycle distribution of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells.

we believe that the reduction in cell number induced by treatment of mcf-7aro cells with these inhibitors is due, not only to the prevention of cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest, but also to the induction of cell death. thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms associated with cell death resulting from the treatment of er-positive cells with inhibitors of aromatase. our results showed that the treated cells presented morphological alterations typical of cells undergoing apoptosis, such as condensation/marginalization of chromatin and membrane blebbing, as well as vacuolization of the cytoplasm, a feature of autophagy. typical apoptotic bodies were not observed. previous studies revealed that mcf- <dig> cells are responsive to apoptotic stimuli  <cit>  and although dna fragmentation occurs  <cit> , they lack pro-caspase- <dig> polypeptide  <cit> . moreover, in previous published data using mcf- <dig>  <cit>  and mcf-7aro cells  <cit> , activation of caspase-3/ <dig> was not observed for any of the treatments, which is in accordance to our results. this study also showed that compounds 3a and 4a induced increased binding of annexin v on mcf-7aro cells after  <dig> hr of treatment related with the phosphatidilserine exposure on the cell surface, which is known to have a key role on the clearance of apoptotic cells  <cit> . nevertheless, madden and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that phosphatidylserine exposure, in addition to being a marker of apoptosis, can also occur in cells dying by autophagic cell death. moreover, electron microscopy revealed the presence of many isolated autophagossomes engolfing cytoplasmic fractions and organelles. it has been reported that although features of various death pathways can be exhibited, only the most effective one is usually evident. in fact, autophagic cell death was induced in a promonocyte cell line treated with arsenic trioxide  <cit>  and tgf-β induced both apotosis and autophagy in a mammary bovine cell line  <cit> . electron microscopy results with 3a and 4a-treated mcf-7aro cells reinforce the origin of mdc-stained vesicles, showing the presence of multiple autophagosomes dispersed throughout the cytosol. it seems that different pathways of programmed cell death can be induced by these anti-aromatase treatments, ie. apoptosis and autophagic cell death, suggesting mutual interactions between these two types of cell death, however the molecular switch is not defined. several studies pointed out that there is a crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagic cell death. execution of apoptosis can be preceded by and may even depend on autophagy  <cit>  or autophagy may rather antagonize or delay apoptosis and its inhibition may increase the sensitivity for the cells to apoptotic signals  <cit> . motyl and colleagues have also shown that apoptosis might be accompanied by increased autophagy as a cytoprotective process, but in advanced stages might result in a particular type of programmed cell death. the threshold that separates these two processes is not clear and might depend on the extension of degradation of cellular components  <cit> . some authors have previously shown that some ais  <cit>  induce cell death of breast cancer cell lines by apoptosis. however, it has also been reported that various anticancer therapies, including tamoxifen and other anti-estrogenic agents, induced autophagic cell death in breast cancer mcf- <dig> cells  <cit>  and in fm3a breast cancer cells  <cit> , and crotoxin can also induced this type of programmed cell death in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our in vitro studies showed that the two steroidal ais, 3a and 4a, are potent inhibitors of breast cancer cell proliferation. moreover, it was also shown that the antiproliferative effects of these two steroids on mcf-7aro cells are mediated by disrupting cell cycle progression, through cell cycle arrest in g0/g <dig> phase and induction of cell death. we believe that both autophagic cell death and/or caspase- <dig> independent apoptosis may participate in mcf-7aro cell death induced by 3a and 4a, being the dominant mechanism autophagic cell death. the precise mechanisms underlying the different roles of autophagic cell death and the signalling pathways activated upon treatment of breast cancer cells with these steroidal ais remain to be studied. in this way, it is important to understand the molecular components and signalling pathways of cell death machinery of cancer cells to help in the establishment of appropriate therapeutics, in order to provide new insights into the treatment of tumours with ais.
