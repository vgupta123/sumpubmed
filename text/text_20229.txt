BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are multipotent progenitor cells that localize in the stromal compartment of the bone marrow , where they support hematopoiesis and differentiate into mesenchymal lineages  <cit> . the potential of msc to form bone, cartilage, and adipose tissues has been well documented both in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit> . however, the plasticity of msc is not limited to mesenchymal derivatives, since msc have been induced to differentiate into mesodermal, neuroectodermal and endodermal lineages  <cit> . msc can be directly isolated from bone marrow aspirates based on their ability to adhere to plastic when plated in monolayer culture, by flow cytometry and sorting separation or with micromagnetic beads by using specific antibodies for stem cells  <cit> . thereafter, human multipotent stem cells derived from marrow stroma proliferate ex vivo to form a phenotypically homogeneous population of cells that express surface antigens markers cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and lack expression of cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and cd <dig>   <cit> .

the regulatory mechanisms which are essential for maintenance of msc characteristics or triggering differentiation are only partially understood  <cit> . after in vitro differentiation of human msc into the osteogenic lineage, evaluation of the osteocyte phenotype has identified cells positive for the bone extracellular matrix protein osteocalcin  and the mineralization-associated enzyme alkaline phosphatase   <cit> . similarly, induction of chondrogenic differentiation results in the majority of cells expressing cartilage-specific proteins including matrix markers aggrecan  and collagen 2a <dig> , and essential transcription factor sry  box  <dig>   <cit> . whereas, the adipogenic induction has been characterized in human and mouse msc by increase in the expression of fatty acid peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ  and fatty acid-binding protein  <dig>   <cit> .

several studies have evaluated the expression of differentiation markers in msc linages; however, fewer reports have analyzed the expression of pluripotent genes during differentiation of msc. the transcriptional regulator octamer-binding protein  <dig>  along with co-regulators nanog and sry   <dig>  coordinate a program of gene activity that suppresses differentiation and allows self-renewal in embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . in msc; however, levels of oct <dig> are low  <cit>  or inexistent  <cit>  and its activity has been reported to be dispensable for msc self-renewal  <cit> . while the role of nanog in msc has been investigated at lesser extent than oct <dig>  expression of nanog has been detected in msc, where ectopic overexpression increases the potential for osteogenic differentiation  <cit> .

cells with features of mesenchymal precursors have been isolated from the bm of many mammals, including laboratory rodents  <cit> , humans  <cit> , cats  <cit> , dogs  <cit>  and pigs  <cit> . despite the wide relevance of the bovine experimental model in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, limited information regarding bovine msc  is available. considering their similarities in organ size and physiology with humans and their longer life span in comparison with the traditional laboratory animal models, large animals are considered to be an excellent model for long-term experiments in regenerative medicine  <cit> . thus, derivation of besc would be invaluable for testing the efficiency and safety of these cells for future cell therapies and for the creation of human disease models. cattle can give numerous advantages for making progress in clinical applications of msc to human medicine, especially in musculoskeletal health problems  <cit> . previous studies reported isolation and mesenchymal differentiation of bmsc from calf bm  <cit>  and bovine umbilical cord  <cit> . however, differentiation potential of bmsc derived from other sources including fetal bm remains unknown. human msc isolated from fetal bm have been shown to have higher proliferative capacity, trilineage differentiation potential and lower immunogenicity compared to msc from umbilical cord, adult bm or adipose tissue  <cit> . in particular, human fetal bm msc had higher proliferative and osteogenic capacity than msc derived from other ontological and anatomical origins, suggesting they are superior candidates for bone tissue engineering  <cit> .

the development of large animal experimental models including cattle may open alternative strategies for investigating msc physiology and eventual applications for regenerative therapy in human and veterinary medicine. currently, animal bm is the most common source of msc for clinical and research uses. in the present study, we used abattoir-derived bovine fetuses as an available and plentiful source of bm with the aim to obtain an abundant supply of bmsc and to minimize risk for donor and recipient. our main objective was to isolate bmsc from abattoir-derived fetal bm and to characterize the multipotent and differentiation potential during in vitro osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation by quantitative and qualitative analyses.

RESULTS
isolation of bone marrow msc from abattoir-derived bovine fetuses
isolation of bmsc from fetal bm was performed based on the capacity for plastic attachment under standard culture conditions that included dmem media supplemented with 10% fbs. colonies of fibroblast-like cells attached to the plastic were visualized at days 5– <dig> after seeding. cells exhibited characteristic spindle shape and polygonal morphology. isolated cells were cultured for several weeks in monolayer and used for differentiation experiments after  <dig> to  <dig> passages.

mesenchymal cell surface markers and population doublings
three independent cultures of bmsc were analyzed for the expression of mesenchymal and hematopoietic surface markers using quantitative-pcr . bmsc expressed higher  levels of msc cell surface markers cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd  <dig>  compared to hematopoietic markers cd <dig> and cd <dig> . no significant differences were detected for population doublings  between consecutive passages until passage  <dig> .

osteogenic differentiation
supplementation of osteogenic factors during a 27-day period induced cell morphology changes that included formation of cell projections and development of intricate cell interactions and extracellular matrix . oc mrna levels significantly increased in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture  and continue to rise through day  <dig> . at day  <dig>  nanog mrna levels significantly increased in differentiated bmsc compared to day- <dig> control . cd <dig> expression was up-regulated  in untreated control bmsc at day  <dig> of culture . alpl activity increased  in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture compared to untreated controls . oc expression was detected by immunofluorescence in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture . at this stage, an intense matrix mineralization was detected using von kossa staining in differentiated bmsc cultures .

effect of ascorbic acid and fbs supplementation on bmsc osteogenic differentiation
supplementation of  <dig>  mm of ascorbic acid to bmsc cultures induced higher  oc mrna levels  compared to  <dig>  mm  and  <dig>  mm  concentrations at day  <dig> of culture . reduction in fbs supplementation to 2% resulted in lower  oc mrna  compared to 10%  and 5% . nanog mrna levels decreased  in bmsc supplemented with  <dig>  mm ,  <dig>  mm  and  <dig>  mm  of ascorbic acid compared to untreated control cells . addition of  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm of ascorbic acid induced higher  alpl activity in bmsc compared to addition of  <dig>  mm or no addition of ascorbic acid . treatment of  <dig>  mm of ascorbic acid in combination with 10% or 5% fbs resulted in stronger von kossa staining compared to other treatments .

chondrogenic differentiation
cultured of bmsc under chondrogenic conditions using a micromass culture system for  <dig> days induced cartilage formation . glycosaminoglycan was detected using alcian blue staining in cartilage pellets at day  <dig> of culture . acan mrna levels increased significantly in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig>  and continued to rise through day  <dig> of culture . nanog mrna levels were lower  in differentiating bmsc at day  <dig>  and at day  <dig> of culture . col2a <dig> mrna levels increased  in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture . similarly, sox <dig> mrna levels significantly increased in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture . immunoreactivity for acan was detected in histological sections of cartilage pellets at day  <dig> of culture .

adipogenic differentiation
culture of bmsc under adipogenic conditions induced formation of cell aggregates and presence of lipid vacuoles in the cell cytoplasm . ap <dig> mrna levels increased  in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig>  and at day  <dig>  of culture . no significant differences were detected in nanog or pparγ mrna levels between treatments or sampling days . pparγ was immunodetected associated to the nuclear cell compartment in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture . moreover, lipid vacuoles were stained with oil red in differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture .

discussion
in the present study, bmsc were isolated from bm collected from abattoir-derived fetuses based on the capacity to adhere to plastic flasks under monolayer culture conditions. this method has been reported for isolation of msc in various animal models including sheep  <cit> , pig  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> . cell cultures isolated by this method are composed by a heterogeneous cell population that includes a mixture of progenitor cells with different degrees of commitment  <cit> . in our study, isolated bmsc maintained different cell morphologies from fibroblast-like, spindle-shaped cells to large flat cells. despite this heterogeneous conformation, the bmsc cultures expressed high levels of mrna of msc specific surface markers cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> and scarce levels of hematopoietic cell surface markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  a constant growth rate was detected in bmsc cultures for  <dig> consecutive passages. similarly, bmsc collected from calves were reported to have constant growth rates until passage  <dig>  followed by progressive reduction and culture senescence  <cit> . reports in human adults msc indicated that senescence begins at passage  <dig>  <cit> , which suggests differences in proliferative potential according to developmental stage. although the pluripotent potential of bmsc after more than  <dig> to  <dig> passages was not analyzed in the present study, it has been reported that bmsc collected from calves bm are able to maintain osteogenic differentiation potential for up to  <dig> passages  <cit> .

the multipotent state and potential for multilineage differentiation of bmsc was evaluated using quantitative and qualitative analyses. protocols used for differentiation of msc have been previously reported in the same and other species  <cit> . culture of bmsc during a 27-day period under osteogenic conditions induced complex cell morphology and extracellular matrix formation. oc mrna levels and alpl activity increased in differentiating bmsc compared to untreated controls. osteogenesis was confirmed at day  <dig> of differentiation by immunolabeling of oc and von kossa staining of matrix mineralization. these results indicate that constant exposure to osteogenic medium induced a time-dependent osteogenesis in fetal bmsc. previous studies reported similar osteogenic potential in bmsc isolated from calf bm and umbilical cord blood  <cit> . msc derived from adult bm were reported to have equivalent osteogenic capacity in other species including horse  <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and pig  <cit> . our data suggest that fetal bmsc bear comparable osteogenic potential to perinatal and postnatal msc; however, a more comprehensive study is required in order to determine potential differences between ontological stages. cd <dig> is a membrane-bound glycoprotein involved in both signal transduction and ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity. although cd <dig> is a key molecule for defining msc  <cit> , its specific role in msc remains unknown. recent studies have suggested that cd <dig> may be involved in msc osteogenic differentiation via adenosine receptor  signaling  <cit> . in our study, cd <dig> mrna was detected in all stages of bmsc differentiation; however, at day  <dig> of culture differentiated bmsc expressed lower level of cd <dig> mrna compared to untreated controls. similar reduction in cd <dig> expression has been reported after osteogenic differentiation in human msc  <cit>  suggesting that this protein may be regulated during osteogenic differentiation.

a dose-dependent experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid and fbs supplementation in the osteogenic differentiation on bmsc. ascorbic acid plays a key role as a cofactor in the post-translational modification of collagen molecules  <cit> . various mesenchyme-derived cell types including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes and odontoblasts increase collagen production and osteogenic potential after exposure to ascorbic acid  <cit> . in our study, culture of bmsc with high concentration of ascorbic acid  resulted in higher oc mrna levels and alpl activity, and stronger mineralization of the matrix compared to lower concentration . moreover, nanog mrna levels were intensely down-regulated in bmsc treated with the same concentration. supplementation of fbs to culture media has been shown to increase proliferation of msc  <cit> . the effect of fbs alters the metabolic state of msc and may also affect the terminal differentiation of msc. in our study, reduction in fbs to 5% and 2% in bmsc culture media resulted in lower oc mrna levels and less mineralization of the matrix compared to 10%. however, alpl activity and nanog mrna levels were not affected by these treatments. overall, these results indicate that osteogenic differentiation of bmsc may be enhanced by increasing ascorbic acid supplementation to media culture; whereas; reduction in fbs supplementation to 5% or 2% may compromise the osteogenic differentiation process.

culture of bmsc for 21 days under chondrogenic conditions that included supplementation of tgfβ resulted in formation of a cartilage pellet. up-regulation of cartilage-specific genes acan, col2a <dig> and sox <dig> evidenced the chondrogenic differentiation of bmsc. alcian blue staining of glycosaminoglycans in histological sections of the cartilage pellet confirmed extracellular matrix formation. comparable results were previously reported in other study using similar number of bmsc and concentration of tgfβ  <cit> . however, these authors also described spontaneous differentiation of bmsc cultured in tgfβ-free media. in our study, bmsc cultured in control media  expressed low levels of acan, col2a <dig> and sox <dig> mrna and were unable to undergo cartilage formation. despite the effect of tgfβ was not evaluated in our study, our data indicate that media containing chondrogenic factors is required to induce differentiation of bmsc.

adipogenic differentiation of bmsc was first characterized by observation of drastic morphology changes including formation of cell aggregates and accumulation of lipid vacuoles. levels of pparγ mrna in bmsc during adipogenesis were no significantly different between treatments. at day  <dig> of adipogenic culture, mrna levels of pparγ were  <dig> -fold higher in differentiated compared to control bmsc. these results differ from a previous study using bmsc isolated from 2-to-6 months old calves, where pparγ mrna levels were  <dig> -fold higher in differentiated compared to control cells  <cit> . differences in results between both studies may be associated to the limited developmental activation of the pparγ gene in fetal compared to calf bmsc, since preadipocyte differentiation and number of pparγ positive cells have a dependent association with fetal age  <cit> . despite reduced levels of pparγ mrna, the pparγ protein was immunodetected in the nuclei of differentiated bmsc at day  <dig> of culture. nuclear localization follows pparγ activation in various types of cells indicating that a functional pparγ protein is present in differentiated bmsc  <cit> . the absence of pparγ signal in the control bmsc at the same stage may be the consequence of the reduced levels of pparγ mrna detected in these cells, which were similar to the undifferentiated state at day  <dig> of culture . in contrast to pparγ, levels of ap <dig> mrna were up-regulated at days  <dig> and  <dig> of culture in differentiated bmsc compared to controls. adipogenesis was confirmed at day  <dig> of culture by detection of lipid vacuoles using oil red staining. overall these results indicate that bmsc from fetal bm conserve adipogenic potential under in vitro culture conditions; however, these cells may also present variations in the expression of some adipogenic markers described in postnatal msc.

the levels of nanog and oct <dig> mrna were analyzed with the aim to evaluate the state of multipotency in bmsc during mesenchymal differentiation. nanog and oct <dig> regulate the maintenance of pluripotent state in embryos and derived cells in most mammalian species  <cit> . both transcription factors had been proposed to play a similar role in adult stem cells  <cit> . however, recent reports have questioned this role under in vitro conditions  <cit> . our analyses by q-pcr using two different sets of primers were unable to detect oct <dig> mrna both in undifferentiated and differentiated bmsc . the lack of oct <dig> expression has also been reported in msc derived from human bm  <cit> . in our study, the pattern of nanog mrna changed according to lineage differentiation. while nanog mrna levels were not affected under adipogenic culture; the osteogenic and chondrogenic conditions induced higher and lower expression of this gene, respectively. these results agree with data in human msc where expression of nanog was associated to adaptation to in vitro cell growth conditions  <cit> . moreover, these results suggest that nanog expression is significantly affected by culture conditions of bmsc.

CONCLUSIONS
our data generated by quantitative and qualitative analyses support the capacity for multilineage differentiation of bone marrow msc isolated from abattoir-derived bovine fetuses. the expression patterns of linage-specific markers in differentiating bmsc were similar to previously reported for bmsc derived from other sources. however, expression patterns of pluripotent markers mrna oct <dig> and nanog were different from previously reported in other species, suggesting that variation may occur according to animal species or culture conditions. the osteogenic differentiation of bmsc was affected by ascorbic acid and fbs concentrations in culture media. the simplicity of isolation and the potential to differentiate into several cell types lays the foundation for bone marrow msc isolated from abattoir-derived bovine fetuses, as an alternative source of msc for investigation of biology and eventual applications for regenerative therapy in human and veterinary medicine.
