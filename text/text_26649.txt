BACKGROUND
the global burden of breast cancer  is  <dig>  million and is one of the leading causes of cancer related death among women and the most frequently diagnosed cancer in  <dig> of  <dig> countries, as per the  <dig> statistics  <cit> . although advancements in diagnosis, screening and awareness help identify bc at an early stage, optimal management has remained a challenge due to its histological and molecular heterogeneity  <cit> , and varying response to therapies even within clinical subtypes of bc  <cit> . identification and validation of prognostic markers that can stratify patients based on their risk for recurrence and/or death may help in optimizing therapies to improve disease outcomes and quality of life. estrogen receptor  and human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig>  are widely being used as both prognostic and predictive markers but remain as imperfect estimators of the risk for recurrence  <cit> . while, messenger rna  signatures from global gene expression profiling have also been put forth as potential prognostic markers for bc , their utility is limited to specific clinical settings  <cit> . this further emphasizes the need to identify robust prognostic markers with higher sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility.

micrornas  are evolutionarily conserved small non-coding rnas that have shown promise as both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for several cancer types  <cit> . predominantly, mirnas behave as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, promoting either mrna degradation or translation inhibition, depending upon the complementarity shared between the seed sequence of mirnas and the corresponding 3' untranslated region of the target sequence . however, studies have shown that they also activate gene expression  <cit> . being either pleiotropic  or highly redundant  in nature  <cit> , the impact of mirna dysregulation in cancer is complex and yet promising in the overall landscape of tumorigenesis and prognostication.

although several studies have highlighted the significance of mirnas as diagnostic  <cit>  and prognostic markers for various cancers  <cit> , including bc , a consensus signature has not yet been identified due to differences in the profiling platforms employed, analytical approaches implemented, sample types  used for analysis and tumor heterogeneity. the majority of the studies have utilized profiling platforms such as microarray or qrt-pcr, which are limited to the detection of known targets at the time of assay development. hybridization platforms are also burdened with the problems of cross hybridization, background signal, low sensitivity and limitations on the dynamic range of detection. these problems are now overcome by next generation sequencing  platforms  <cit> . ngs also offers the advantage of capturing not just mirnas but a whole repertoire of small rnas, even those present in low abundance  <cit> , thus enabling a comprehensive analysis of small rnaome. however, despite several advantages offered by ngs, only few studies have utilized ngs platform to identify prognostic markers for bc  <cit> .

statistical methods implemented in a study also play a vital role in determining the reproducibility of findings in a prognostic signature. two methods to identify prognostic markers are widely used in the published literature– the case–control  approach  <cit>  and the case-only  approach  <cit> . while the former method utilizes a set of differentially expressed mirnas for downstream analysis, the latter offers the advantage of being unbiased in selecting mirnas for further analysis. although each of the methods has been used in published mirna studies, no study has analyzed a dataset using both the methods to compare and identify the best approach.

in this study, we hypothesized that relative variations in mirna expression in tumors and/or apparently normal  tissues contribute to inter-individual differences in disease trajectory and eventual treatment outcomes. we profiled mirnas from  <dig> breast cancers, predominantly of luminal a and triple negative subtypes and  <dig> normal tissues  using the ngs platform . our choice of reduction mammoplasty specimens from apparently healthy subjects was based on the recent literature evidence that comparisons between reduction mammoplasty specimens and tumor adjacent normal tissues showed differential expression of mirnas, suggesting that adjacent normal tissue may not mirror the normal tissue in terms of histological and molecular characteristics  <cit> . profiling of long non-coding rnas showed differences between tumor adjacent normal tissues and tumor tissues. differentially expressed long non-coding rnas were not identified from tumor adjacent normal tissues vs. tumor tissues but were identified only when tumor tissues were compared with reduction mammoplasty specimens, further suggesting that reduction mammoplasty specimens may be the optimal baseline tissue  <cit> . our specific objectives were as follows:  to identify differentially expressed mirnas in breast tissues  and  to identify mirnas as prognostic markers  for bc  and validate the signatures using an external dataset. we have identified a total of twelve mirnas associated with os and/or rfs for bc. of these twelve, we have replicated the prognostic significance of ten mirnas already reported in literature for bc. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report two novel mirnas  for bc prognosis.

RESULTS
descriptive statistics of ngs and differentially expressed mirnas
a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig> , <dig> reads were detected from the tumor and normal samples, respectively, of which 59 % and 51 % of the reads were retained after adapter trimming. 84–87 % of the reads were mappable to the reference human genome and a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were mappable to different non-coding rna classes . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads mappable to mature human mirnas belonged to  <dig>  unique mirnas . a total of  <dig> mirnas were retained after filtering for low read counts. following normalization and batch effects correction , one tumor sample was identified as a potential outlier and was removed from further analysis. of the  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> were differentially expressed  with fold change  >  <dig>  and false discovery rate  cut-off of  <dig> , of which  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using de mirnas. as expected, there was a clear separation of normal and tumor samples, illustrating that the generated mirna signatures differentiate the two tissue types . also, the clustering of samples based on de is to indicate that the samples are differentiated by the relative expression of a common set of mirnas rather than by unique mirnas.fig.  <dig> overall workflow of the study. in literature, there are two widely used approaches to identify rnas with prognostic significance – case–control approach and case only. in the former approach, only differentially expressed  rnas are considered for survival analysis whereas in the latter approach, all of the profiled rnas are considered for survival analysis which therefore aids in identifying prognostic rnas which would have otherwise not been identified in case–control. while either of the two approaches has been adopted in literature, both the approaches have been followed in this study. ff = fresh frozen; ffpe = formalin fixed paraffin embedded; normalization* = reads per kilobase per million ; fdr = false discovery rate; os = overall survival; rfs = recurrence free survival



mirnas as prognostic signatures for os and rfs
case–control approach: eighty de mirnas were treated as continuous variables and were subjected to univariate cox analysis, followed by permutation test. four mirnas were associated with os and two mirnas were associated with rfs with permutation p ≤  <dig> . the four and two mirnas identified for os  and rfs , respectively were used for constructing the risk score. a risk score cut-off point of  <dig>  for os was used to dichotomize the cases into low-  and high-risk groups . similarly, samples were grouped into the two risk groups based on the cut-off point estimated for rfs . risk score was then treated as a categorical variable and entered into the univariate cox model. tumor stage, grade, age at diagnosis and tnbc status were considered as other clinical covariates and were first tested for their significance in the univariate cox model. tumor stage, grade and age at diagnosis were considered as potential confounders, and, irrespective of their significance in the univariate analysis, they were entered into the multivariate model along with the risk score. the higher-risk group was found to have both shorter os  and rfs , after adjusting for confounders .table  <dig> demographics of the samples chosen for the study

identification of potential targets for mirnas and their role in cancer biology
the in-house transcriptome  datasets available for bc were accessed   <cit>  and analyzed for de of mrnas from a matched subset of samples .  <dig>  genes  were de, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated.

a combined total of  <dig>  targets were predicted by targetscan for the  <dig> mirnas associated with os and/or rfs. of these, only  <dig> targets  overlapped with the mrna expression dataset. this low percent overlap between in silico and in situ comparisons is expected when breast tissue specific expression signatures filtered for histological and molecular subtypes are used to interrogate the potential interactions between mirna-mrna. the profiled interactions with transcriptome data also serve as an approach for functional validation of the mirna targets within breast tissues and minimize the number of false positive targets identified. a total of  <dig> clusters were found and when interrogated for gene ontology  classifications with an enrichment score  ≥  <dig> ,  <dig> clusters were retained . we identified two targets for mir-574-3p  which did not belong to any cluster due to limited hits. from the clusters, statistically significant go terms  related to cancer were identified. specifically, the following terms were interrogated: transcription, blood vessel development, angiogenesis, cell growth, cell morphogenesis, cell motion, cell migration, cell signaling, mammary gland development, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, cell division and cytoskeletal organization. targets of  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas  were enriched for any one of the above-mentioned terms . targets of mir-574-3p, mir-425-5p, mir-210-3p and mir-193b-3p were clustered with an es ≤  <dig>  when matched mirna-mrna data sets were used and were therefore not probed further. similar analysis of identifying targets from de mrnas was attempted using unmatched samples from the same in-house bc dataset . excellent concordance was observed between the results  obtained from matched samples and unmatched samples , indicating that the use of matched or unmatched samples have no profound impact on the identification of gene targets for the mirnas.table  <dig> univariate and multivariate results for recurrence free survival

discussion
in this study, we identified two mirnas  as potential novel prognostic markers for bc, associated with os. they have not been reported earlier for bc, for their association with either os or rfs. overall, from both the approaches  adopted for the study, eleven mirnas and four mirnas were significant for os and rfs, respectively. out of the four mirnas identified for rfs, three mirnas  were also significant for os.

in recent years, micrornas have gained prominence as valuable prognostic markers for several cancer types, including bc. although considerable progress has been made in this field, clinical application of these mirnas as prognostic markers has not yet been possible because of the generation of different signatures by different studies with only a small number of overlapping molecules  <cit> . this discrepancy may be attributed to several reasons  <cit> , the primary being the use of different profiling platforms. studies employing hybridization techniques or qrt-pcr panels have generated signatures based on the available number of mirnas. while there are ~ <dig>  mirnas identified so far  <cit> , as reported in the mirbase, only a few hundreds have been captured on these platforms  <cit> , of which even fewer have been detected in breast tissues. therefore, we are blinded to the prognostic value of other mirnas from the larger repertoire. on the other hand, ngs profiling of the entire mirnaome, including even the less abundant ones, can now be used to probe the larger repertoire, which was evident from our study. approximately, breast tissue specific mirnas comprise 55 %  of the total mirnas  and these were captured from the  <dig> normal breast tissues and  <dig> breast tumor tissues used for the study, which is by far the largest mirna dataset to be interrogated for identifying prognostic markers for bc. it is also one of the largest studies in terms of number of samples with complete clinical information sequenced for bc.

statistical considerations
more often than not, high-throughput techniques suffer from the problems of high dimensionality  and collinearity , leading to the generation of instable co-efficients in a traditional cox-proportional hazards regression model  <cit> . in such cases, the inclusion of individual mirnas to build a model may not yield reliable results, whereas considering mirnas as continuous variables and constructing risk scores overcomes both these problems. however, there are two widely used methods  to identify mirnas useful for constructing a risk score. in a typical cc approach, two groups are compared to identify de mirnas, which are assessed for their prognostic significance. a co approach offers a wider data set for interrogation, allowing a comprehensive understanding of mirnas. as a proof of principle, we adopted both the approaches to identify prognostic markers. as expected, higher numbers of mirnas were identified as significant in the co approach. eleven mirnas were significant for os and four mirnas were significant for rfs in the co approach as opposed to four and two mirnas significant for os and rfs, respectively, in the cc method. mir-210-3p, mir-425-5p and mir-15a-5p were significant for both os and rfs. a total of  <dig> non-redundant mirnas were found to play a role in bc prognosis.

overall, the differential expression in normal vs. tumor tissues and direction of effects show excellent agreement with what is known from published literature, as detailed below.

novel prognostic mirnas for bc
of the  <dig> mirnas identified in this study, two mirnas  are potential novel prognostic markers for bc. both the mirnas were de in a tumor vs. normal comparison, with mir-574-3p being down-regulated  and mir-660-5p being up-regulated  in the tumor samples. a similar direction of effect has been observed for mir-574-3p and mir-660-5p for ovarian cancer  <cit> , colorectal cancer  <cit>  and gastric cancer  <cit> ; and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> , respectively. however, this is the first report of a potential prognostic role for these mirnas in bc, although mechanistic insights are required to understand their contribution to tumorigenesis.

mirnas with dual roles as tumor suppressor and oncogene
in our study, mir-15a-5p was found to be up-regulated in breast tissues  and the same direction of expression was observed in kaposi sarcoma  <cit>  and papillary thyroid carcinomas  <cit> . however, in other cancer types such as colorectal cancer  <cit> , non-small-cell lung cancer   <cit>  and pituitary tumors  <cit> , it is expressed in the opposite direction . amongst bc reports, kodahl et al. have reported an up-regulation of this mirna  <cit> , and a recent report by shinden et al. has shown mir-15a as an independent prognostic marker for bc  <cit> . similarly, mir-27a-3p, which was found to be up-regulated in tumors  in our study, is in accordance with the direction of expression observed in pancreatic cancer  <cit>  and glioma  <cit> . tang et al. have also reported mir-27a to be an oncomir, the high expression of which promotes breast tumor growth and metastasis and is associated with poor os in bc patients  <cit> . however, it is down-regulated in bladder cancer, compared with the normal samples  <cit> . the observations on mir-15a-5p and mir-27a-3p point to the dual roles of an oncogene and a tumor suppressor and their relative role may be governed in a tissue-specific manner.

mirnas as oncogenes
we observed high expression  of mir-425-5p in breast tumors compared to the normal samples, which is concordant with the results published by kodahl et al. for bc  <cit> . likewise, peng et al. have also observed the oncogenic function of mir- <dig>  which promotes cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion in gastric cancer  <cit> .

up-regulation of mir-146b in tumors and its adverse effect on survival has been demonstrated in lung cancer  <cit> , thyroid carcinoma  <cit>  and prostate cancer  <cit> , among other cancer types. interestingly, mir-146b-5p has also been reported to be up-regulated in bc, which is in accordance with our results  and is known to repress brca <dig> expression, thereby promoting cell proliferation  <cit> .

mir- <dig> is a widely studied oncogene whose high expression is invariably associated with poor outcomes in several cancer types , including bc  <cit> . we also report the same direction of expression in tumor tissues with a fc of  <dig> .

cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis have been found to be promoted in bc , glioblastoma  <cit> , head and neck cancer  <cit>  and gastric cancer  <cit>  due to high expressions of mir- <dig>  mir-196a and mir-374a , demonstrating their oncogenic potential. their role as prognostic markers has also been studied in the above-mentioned cancer types. we were able to identify their prognostic significance following the co approach, and these findings could have been missed if only the cc approach had been used. the read counts of the two groups  revealed that these mirnas were indeed present in higher amounts in tumors relative to the normal samples; the average read counts of mir-210-3p, mir-196a-5p, mir-374a-3p and mir-374a-5p in the normal samples were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively as against  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the tumor group. the lower read counts in normal samples have limited our ability to consider them in a cc study due to our stringent filtering criteria. overall, the patterns of de and prognostic significance for the above mirnas mirror observations from other cancer types.

mirnas as tumor suppressors
in our study, apart from mir-574-3p, mir-193b-3p was also found to be down-regulated  in tumors compared to normal samples, which is in agreement with the studies on endometrioid adenocarcinoma  <cit> , pancreatic cancer  <cit> , oesophageal cancer  <cit>  and gastric cancer  <cit> . even in bc, li et al. have reported a down-regulation of mir-193b in bc cell lines, and the low expression of mir-193b was found to be associated with shorter disease-free survival  <cit> .

functional roles of the identified prognostic mirnas
the prognostic significance for recurrence or survival of an associated mirna is better appreciated from the aspect of potential functional impact on cellular signaling and metabolic pathways, as these contribute to cell death, invasion and overall outcomes for the patient. apart from functional insights, the potential for development of therapeutics is also important. keeping these factors in mind, the following discussion is focused on the delineation of pathways using go terms that are specifically enriched by the identified prognostic mirnas.

databases such as targetscan, miranda  and pictar  have predicted mrna targets, but a validation of the predicted targets adds more credence to in silico predictions. to this end, we first predicted the targets for all  <dig> mirnas using the commonly used database - targetscan; these were then compared with de mrnas obtained from the in-house bc transcriptome dataset. go terms were identified with a specific focus on terms pertaining to hallmarks of cancer. interestingly, targets of eight mirnas were found to be relevant for cell growth and development, indicating that these mirnas may play key roles in tumorigenesis. two targets  were found for mir-574-3p, of which dab2ip is involved in apoptosis  <cit> , cell survival  <cit> , among other functions and samd4a functions as a translational regulator  <cit> .

validation of the identified signatures
in a biomarker study, a validation of the findings across different platforms is critical to rule out technical artifacts. four mirnas exhibiting different fc  were validated using qrt-pcr, with two of the representative mirnas identified as significant in survival analysis. the validation of representative mirnas confirms cross-platform concordance and the relative utility of the signatures identified. however, validations using independent cohorts are also crucial for a biomarker study as they facilitate inter-study concordance of expression trends and signatures. ngs data for bc with a larger sample size and complete clinical information are limited in the public domain. we used the available data from tcga project and applied stringent filtering criteria to obtain a dataset that would be comparable to the discovery set. a total of eleven mirnas which were found to be associated with os from the co approach were considered for validation using the tcga dataset. tcga samples were sequenced using illumina genome analyzer and illumina hiseq platforms. however, all samples were not sequenced on a single platform limiting the analysis and comparisons. although our discovery set of samples were sequenced using the illumina genome analyzer, the number of samples with events  on this platform were limited for the data from tcga. therefore, we considered samples sequenced using illumina hiseq with sufficient follow-up and events . due to the fact that ngs platform specific differences in read counts may potentially influence the risk scores we did not adopt the risk scores and cut-off points generated in discovery set. we therefore generated a new risk score for the validation set and an optimal cut-off point was estimated to dichotomize the samples into low and high risk groups. multivariate analysis revealed that the risk score was significant with p =  <dig>  after adjusting for tumor stage. tcga dataset lacks information on tumor grade. however, tumor grade did not influence the multivariate analysis even in the discovery set. therefore we reasoned that lack of information on grade in the tcga data set would not have influenced the study findings. although for our initial analysis using discovery set we considered p <  <dig>  as nominal, the tcga dataset did not meet this threshold, presumably due to modest sample size  and events  compared to the discovery set . nevertheless, we still observed the same direction of effect , i.e., patients belonging to the high-risk group was associated with shorter survival period and this validates our initial observations from the discovery set.

several differences existed between the discovery and validation datasets:  the ngs platform for discovery set was genome analyzer iix where as for the validation set was hiseq;  the risk score cut-off point were estimated individually due to ngs platform differences;  tcga samples considered for this study were fresh frozen breast cancer tissues whereas the discovery set of breast cancer tissues were from ffpe blocks,  information on tumor grade was not available for tcga samples and  percent cellularity differences were also noted between the discovery and validation cohorts . however, despite these differences and other characteristics , we could demonstrate the trends in the direction of effects  in both the discovery and validation cohorts. the apparent lack of statistical significance  in the os analysis attempted with tcga data may be due to the limited sample size and limited number of events in the validation set affecting the power. further validation of findings is warranted using independent cohorts and higher sample size and events. overall, we report two novel mirnas as potential prognostic markers for breast cancer. remaining mirnas reported in this study showed excellent concordance to the published reports for their role in bc prognosis.table  <dig> univariate and multivariate results for overall survival 

the eleven mirnas identified as significant for os in co approach from the discovery set was validated using tcga dataset. risk score was constructed using the  <dig> mirnas and an optimal cut-off point was estimated using receiver operating characteristics curve, which dichotomized the samples into low and high-risk groups. univariate cox proportional hazards regression model was run for risk score and for other clinical parameters. in the multivariate analysis, risk score was significant with p =  <dig>  after adjusting for tumor stage.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified a total of twelve non-redundant mirnas associated with os and/or rfs. as explained above, ten of the identified mirnas have been reported in literature as associated with bc prognosis and lends support to the findings in this independent study. however, two mirnas  have not been reported previously for bc prognosis. the use of ngs platform to profile mirnas on a whole genome level in bc has been limited thus far in literature and the data provided complements such efforts towards a comprehensive search for biomarkers. the mirnas reported for os have also been validated in independent dataset  and functional characterization may help to understand the complex interplay of mirna mediated gene regulation.

overall, despite the increasing feasibility of profiling mirnas and their role in prognostication, mechanistic insights in to the role of mirnas, establishing gold standard approaches for analysis, and confirmation of these findings by independent laboratories within the context of confounding variables  are needed to advance these promising biomarkers into clinical validation.

there is also a growing body of evidence that other small non-coding rnas such as trnas  <cit> , snornas  <cit>  and pirnas  <cit>  may contribute to tumorigenesis; however their role in bc prognosis is an area of active investigation. therefore, a deeper exploration of their roles may pave the way for a comprehensive understanding of the small non-coding rna classes, aiding in the discovery of newer diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for bc.
