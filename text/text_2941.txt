BACKGROUND
public genomic databanks are inexorably inundated by newly sequenced genomes. the number of complete sequence of prokaryotic genomes that are published per year has increased more than tenfold in the last seven years with a present rate close to four newly published prokaryotic genomes per week. one of the main challenges encountered by genome databanks is that complete genomic sequences are submitted with a heterogeneous and  often crude gene annotation  <cit> . to cope with these major problems and to improve the representation of genomic information, ncbi and ebi are proposing curated versions, the reference sequence   <cit>  and genome reviews  <cit> , respectively. each database team is working independently but they share the same main goal of delivering an up-to-date, standardized and comprehensive view of the completely sequenced genomes that are present in the international nucleotide sequence database  repository ,

to facilitate the use of these standardized genomic data in comparative genomics studies, both refseq and genome reviews include manually curated information. noticeably, refseq and genome reviews provide cross-references to public databases to facilitate database searches. interestingly, many of these cross-references  are specific to the curated database: for instance, refseq has/db_xref to entrez  <cit>  and often to cdd  <cit> , whereas genome reviews has/db_xref to gene ontology  <cit> , interpro  <cit> , and uniprot  <cit> , and occasionally to hogenom  <cit> , and pdb  <cit> .

thus, it would be advantageous to work with both curated databases since they look more complementary than concurrent. however, there is no immediate way to match the respective sequence identifiers listed by either refseq or genome reviews for the same gene of the same reannotated genome, although the knowledgebase uniprot  <cit>  began to add links to both genome databases as this paper was in preparation. moreover, the independent efforts of ncbi and ebi curators in improving the structural annotation of a few cds, lead to increasingly different genomic versions of the same organism. three different instances are expected when comparing the structural annotations made independently by refseq and genome reviews curators:  the amino acid sequences are exactly identical,  both cds share an overlapping identical segment but differ in length,  a few cds are found exclusively in one genome database. this last instance corresponds often to the redefinition of a putative cds as being a pseudogene on the basis of structural features.

we aimed to obtain immediate and exhaustive cross-references of each protein-coding gene when dealing with such possible divergences that reflect different points of view between refseq and genome reviews. accordingly, we designed corbank, a software  that detects not only perfect identities but also any differences between refseq and genome reviews databases.

RESULTS
complete sequences of each replicon of each prokaryotic organism endowed with the same taxonomy id in both refseq and genome reviews were downloaded from each database and mapped by their common insd identification numbers. then, as schematized on fig.  <dig>  we compared both database versions of the same genomic data to identify the cross-references for each gene and to measure their level of matching. accordingly, the different scripts that make up the corbank program  <cit>  were applied to these mapped data in two successive steps in order first to find exact matches and then to identify the nature and location of any difference in imperfect matches.

matching gene sequences in independently curated genome databases
to be as fast as possible, we did not compare the sequence partners by using efficient but slow programs such as blastclust  <cit> . rather, we used the perl language to build hash tables where each amino acid sequence is a key that indexes its encoding cds. matching is straightforward when the same key is found for the two versions of the same gene sequence – one in refseq and the other in genome reviews . in rare instances, more than two identical sequences were found for the two versions of the same genome. this occurred for example with strictly identical insertion sequences present at different locations on the analyzed genome. moreover, we could not dismiss the hypothesis that in very very rare cases pairs of completely conserved paralogues could form bidirectional best matches that may be erroneously interpreted. to handle these problems, we further used the respective gene positions to identify the pertinent couples of corresponding sequences .

using this approach based on hash tables, we found that 98% of copies of the  <dig> , <dig> genes described in both databases are matching, allowing instantaneous retrieval of their respective cross-references .

however, the view was more contrasted when comparing complete genome annotation instead of looking at each individual gene. table  <dig> shows that only  <dig> of the  <dig> complete genomes we have analyzed are perfectly matching at the level of their structural annotation. the other ones differ in terms of their respective total number of sequences and/or distribution of perfect matching sequences . the copies in both curated databases of  <dig> genomes differ by their total numbers of genes and by a significant proportion  of inexact matching of individual genes. the two versions of  <dig> species differ by their respective total numbers of genes but their corresponding cds are matching exactly. for instance, bordetella petrii dsm  <dig> has  <dig> cds that are matching exactly but refseq contains  <dig> cds that are absent from genome reviews, whereas genome reviews display four additional cds and  <dig> pseudo-cds  that are not present in the refseq file. finally, only  <dig> genomes have the same total numbers of genes but up to  <dig> % of their corresponding genes display inexact matching. for instance, xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris str.  <dig> displays  <dig> cds in both genomic databases but the respective amino acid sequence of the product of  <dig> of them differ between refseq and genome reviews. complete data are available in additional file  <dig> and on the corbank site  <cit> ).

defining peculiarities of gene sequences that are partially identical between independently curated genome databases
we further studied these imperfectly matching sequences by measuring their similarity using an alignment-free approach . indeed, such an approach is fast and well-adapted to comparison of varying versions of the same sequence that share a significant common part. as detailed in methods, we calculated the euclidean distance that separates the distributions of words of length l  for each copy of the same gene in refseq and genome reviews, respectively . this allows finding the cross-references between the respective imperfectly matching copies of the same gene . a large variety of differences explaining these imperfect matches have been found using the corbank program . all of these differences – including the very rare ones – have been categorized as summarized in the additional file  <dig> and on the page . corbank is able to filter any differences in any sequence locations .

we found that the differences between matching sequences that have unequal lengths were predominantly  located at the n-terminal part. indeed, it is often difficult to identify the start codon, especially when several methionines are found in this n-terminal region .

identifying the whole differences separating independently curated copies of a genome
scanning paired versions of the same genome with corbank allows computing the statistics of similarities and differences between genome databases. figs.  <dig> and  <dig> detail the results obtained with the archaeon pyrococcus horikoshii. the genomes of three pyrococcus have been published ten years ago: p. horikoshii in  <dig>  <cit> , p. abyssi in  <dig>  <cit>  and p. furiosus in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, these genomes, sequenced and annotated by independent groups, have been curated several times. fig.  <dig> shows that many differences have accumulated between the curated versions of the p. horikoshii genome in refseq and genome reviews . first, the respective total numbers of genes are strikingly different. among the  <dig> sequences published in refseq and the  <dig> ones listed in genome reviews, only  <dig> are matching. secondly, we have only  <dig> of these matches that are exact , while  <dig> display various differences. fig.  <dig>  details a few instances of these differences in length and location of the start and end of each gene. thirdly, fig.  <dig> shows that there are a significant number of sequences putatively encoded by the p. horikoshii genome that are found in uniquely one genome database:  <dig> genes in refseq  and  <dig> in genome reviews , respectively. however, genome reviews classifies as pseudo-cds a list of  <dig> amino acid sequences which have no protein_id. since these pseudo-cds are found as standard coding sequences among the  <dig> sequences that are specific to refseq , we ascertained this point. corbank was further used to match these  <dig> pseudo-cds using uniquely the position information that have been kept in both databases. as a result, fig.  <dig> table b was improved in fig.  <dig> table h after matching  <dig> of the  <dig> genome reviews pseudo-cds as exact and two ones as inexact. thus, it appears that refseq and genome reviews are producing increasingly divergent views of the same genome.

discussion
corbank is fulfilling two complementary goals:  to deliver immediate cross-references between each copy of each gene published in both refseq and genome reviews genome databases;  to identify any differences between both independently curated structural annotations. the first objective is achieved almost immediately: e.g. cross-referencing the two databases versions of a  <dig> cds genome is completed in less than  <dig> second on a basic home computer. exhaustive comparison of the  <dig> prokaryotic species present in both databases at the end of july  <dig>  has been completed in less than  <dig> min. thus, the efficiency of corbank is largely equivalent to that of the picr tool that is described in a paper  <cit>  that appeared as we were writing a first version of this manuscript. picr, a web service allowing matching a large variety of protein sequence identifiers, is restricted to 100% identity matches and cannot discriminate the correct pair when recovering more than two identical sequences since it does not exploit information about genomic locations, contrarily to corbank. thus, this picr tool and a previous one, magicmatch  <cit> , are not as efficient as corbank to match exhaustively genome databases. this quality is especially true of our second goal that is achieved uniquely by corbank. its exhaustive comparison of the species currently present in both refseq and genome reviews shows dramatic differences in the structural annotations of a large portion of their copies of the same genomes . of the  <dig> compared genomes,  <dig> differ in their total numbers of cds and  <dig> have from  <dig> to  <dig> coding sequences per genome that differ in length.

the large majority of the  <dig> perfectly matching genomes correspond to newly sequenced species where the manual curation has not been started. however, there is no direct correlation between the sequencing age and the level of divergence between the lastly curated versions of the same genome as shown on tables  <dig> and  <dig> that list the top ten database-specific organisms in both refseq and genome reviews, respectively. actually, a spearman test failed to show any correlation of the different parameters computed by corbank with the time elapsed since the completion of sequence .

surprisingly, even the two versions of a model organism such as escherichia coli k <dig>  that has been recently extensively reannotated in cooperative works  <cit>  display significant differences. of the  <dig> gene-encoding proteins, only  <dig> are matching , and both databases differ in their interpretation of some genes as being described as pseudo-cds:  <dig> in refseq versus  <dig> in genome reviews. in fact, the structural identification of putative pseudogenes in e. coli k <dig> has been previously described  but it is surprising that there is still disagreement even for these e. coli k <dig> pseudogenes.

as we were writing this paper, uniprotkb began to add/db_xref to refseq and genome reviews protein_id. however, we observed that rather often the same swissprot file has cross-references to multiple refseq and genome reviews protein_id. this is why we think that corbank is – presently – the only software publishing unambiguous mapping of refseq, genome reviews, and uniprot identifiers of a protein.

CONCLUSIONS
data dependencies inherent to the annotation process by homology make genome data predestined for propagated errors  <cit> . thus, data cleansing is a necessity for genome data after the data is produced. however, such cleansing is uneasy since it is often impossible to find the correct solution right away. instead, there often exists a set of alternative solutions. accordingly, refseq and genome reviews appear to have diverged in looking for correct solutions when performing credibility checking on the insd crude data. credibility checking is a very important step for genome data production since the correctness of data is crucial before it is used within other processes such as annotation of newly sequenced genomes by homology to previously annotated genomes. however, such independent efforts made by both automatic and manual procedures  <cit>  led to increasingly divergent reannotated data as shown in this work. clearly, the time has come to enable curators of both genome databases to establish a minimum of dialogue. whenever it would be technically possible, a useful compromise may be found where each database publishes the point of view of the other one. we acknowledge that such a harmonization effort looks rather complicated to be done. however, it would be very helpful for the whole community.
