BACKGROUND
quantum dots  are emerging as an exciting new class of fluorescent probes for non-invasive in vivo imaging  <cit> . compared to conventional organic dyes, qds offer a number of fascinating optical and electronic properties. qds are semiconductor nanocrystals that can be excited by a wide range of light, ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared, and can emit different wavelengths of light, depending on their size and composition. qds have broad excitation spectra and narrow emission spectra . because qds can be excited by one single wavelength and can emit light of different wavelengths, they are ideal probes for multiplex imaging  <cit> . by contrast, conventional organic dyes cannot be easily synthesized to emit different colors and have narrow excitation spectra and broad emission spectra that often cross into the red wavelengths, making it difficult to use these dyes for multiplexing. in addition, qds have exceptional photostability . due to their extreme brightness and resistance to photobleaching  <cit> , qds are ideal for live cell imaging wherein cells must be kept under the excitation light source for long periods of time. their intense brightness is also helpful for single particle detection . by comparison, conventional dyes often photobleach, making longitudinal tracking difficult.

qds' photophysical properties have broadened their application and shown great promise as imaging probes in bioimaging, drug discovery, and diagnosis. to keep up with their burgeoning utility, current qd technology has rapidly evolved. qds have been used for tumor targeting and imaging  <cit> , lymph node  <cit>  and vascular mapping  <cit> , and cellular trafficking  <cit> . qds can be delivered in a targeted fashion by conjugating them with ligands and antibodies. qds can also be introduced into cells non-specifically, which serves as a potential tracking marker for cellular imaging.

stem cell therapy holds promise for treatment of intractable conditions such as parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and degenerative joint diseases  <cit> . there are two types of cells used in stem cell therapy, adult stem cells and embryonic stem  cells. of the two, es cells are the ultimate source for use in cell-based therapy because they posses a virtually unlimited capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency, which is defined as the ability to differentiate into all cell types, including neurons, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, islet cells, skeletal muscle cells, and endothelial cells  <cit> . in stem cell therapy, monitoring of cell survival and location after transplantation is important for determining their efficacy. because the absorption and scattering of light in biological tissue can be considerable, any optical signal transmitted from deep tissues to the surface tends to diminish in strength . with qds' many advantages over traditional organic dyes, qds may provide an excellent tool for imaging stem cell therapy.

in this study, we use the peptide-based reagent qtracker to label mouse es cells with qds and evaluate the utility of qds for imaging stem cell therapy. we next show that labeling mouse es cells with qds does not adversely affect es cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation. finally, we examine qds' potential for imaging es cells in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
qtracker intracellular qd delivery
to deliver qds, we used peptide-based qtracker, which has been shown to be an excellent and easy tool for study live cell mobility  <cit>  and cell fusion  <cit> . in order to determine transfection efficiency in es cells, labeled es cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. figure 2a shows a representative histogram plot based on forward scatter and side scatter gated cells. the red line shows fluorescence intensity of control unlabeled cells and the green line represents the labeled cells. as more qds were taken up by these cells, the fluorescence intensity increased. around 72% of the cells were positive  <dig> hours after labeling and the mean fluorescence intensity  was  <dig>  however, by day  <dig> the percentage of positive cells had dropped to ~4% and by day  <dig> only ~ <dig> % of the cells were positive by facs analysis when compared to control unlabeled cells. fluorescence microscopy  was used to image the cells on day  <dig>  representative brightfield and fluorescent images are shown in figure 2b. es cells can be labeled and monitored by facs analysis up to  <dig> days.

qds do not affect es cell viability and proliferation
toxicity of qds is a key factor in determining whether it will be a feasible probe for both cellular and clinical use. we carefully examined qds' effect on es cells by trypan blue exclusion assay and a cyquant proliferation assay. figure 3a shows the percentage of live cells in triplicates at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post qd labeling. overall, there was no significant difference between labeled and unlabeled es cells  for all qds that were tested: qd  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  to evaluate cell proliferation, we used the cyquant assay, which measures the amount of nucleic acids in each well, thereby giving an accurate count of the number of cells in the experimental condition. as shown in figure 3b, there was also no significant difference between qd labeled es cells and unlabeled es cells .

qds have no profound effects on es cell differentiation in vitro
having demonstrated that qd labeling had no detectable effect on es cell growth, we next tested its effect on cellular development and differentiation. dubertret et al. showed that at high concentrations, qds injected into an individual blastomere of xenopus during very early cleavage stages can cause apparent abnormalities in late stage embryos  <cit> . therefore, we examined the pluripotency of qd labeled mouse es cells to ascertain if any developmental interference would occur. in the literature, both human and murine es cells have well-documented differentiation and replication capacities  <cit> . mouse es cells were differentiated in vitro by hanging drop assay. we then isolated rna samples from undifferentiated mouse es cells and embryoid body at day  <dig> and analyzed them by rt-pcr. both labeled and unlabeled undifferentiated es cells  expressed es cell specific marker oct <dig>  likewise, both labeled and unlabeled differentiated es cells  expressed specific markers for endoderm , mesoderm , and ectoderm  germ layers  <cit>  .

in vivo multiplex imaging using qds
one of the most attractive qualities of qds is their capability for multiplex imaging . in addition, as qds are larger than organic dyes, they are not transferred between cells until the cells fuse. therefore, qds can provide an excellent tool for studying cell-cell interactions  <cit> . here we used qd  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to label  <dig> ×  <dig> es cells as described. right after qd labeling, the labeled cells were subcutaneously injected into various locations on the back of athymic nude mice. images were taken right after injection and the resulting stacked image shown in figure 4a. the fluorescent intensity was directly proportional to the product of extinction coefficient and the quantum yield. even though the qds were excited by the same wavelength, the energy absorbed was different for each qd, causing some qds to absorb less energy than others. this observation is due to the qds' ability to produce different light levels at the same excitation wavelength as shown in figure 1a. therefore, qds with longer emission wavelengths will appear brighter. with the same excitation wavelength, the signal intensity /exposure time in millisecond) was  <dig> ±  <dig> for cells labeled with qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>  quantification of these results is shown in figure 4b. in order to evaluate which qd was better for non-invasive imaging, we imaged the same transplanted mice longitudinally. after day  <dig>  es cells labeled with qd  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> could not be detected in vivo using the maestro system. in contrast, qd  <dig> signal could be detected up to  <dig> days in animals post injection, which is likely due to its higher extinction coefficient and wider emission spectra within near-infrared region.

detection sensitivity for in vivo imaging using qd800
we have shown that qd  <dig> offers greater fluorescent intensity than the other qds tested. however, its detection sensitivity is currently unknown. in particular, what are the fewest number of labeled cells that can be detected by the maestro system and for what duration? in order to determine the detection sensitivity for in vivo imaging, we subcutaneously injected different numbers of qd  <dig> labeled es cells  into the back of the mice right after labeling. images were taken  <dig> hour post injection and then daily thereafter for  <dig> weeks using the maestro optical imaging system . figure 5a showed that ~ <dig> ×  <dig> subcutaneously injected qd labeled cells could be seen through the maestro system. the signal intensity quantification is shown in figure 5b. since qd  <dig> could also be excited by red light, which offered better tissue penetration, we also imaged the mice using excitation filter  <dig> nm and emission filter  <dig> long-pass . we compared the resulting image to that obtained from earlier settings. although we still could not visualize the  <dig> ×  <dig> labeled cells, the signal intensity from  <dig> ×  <dig> labeled cells did increase with the red light excitation  . again, signals were still present in the animals up to day  <dig> using excitation filter  <dig> nm as shown in figure 5e.

postmortem histologic analysis of qd labeled es cells
after imaging, animals were sacrificed and the subcutaneous tumor developed from  <dig> ×  <dig> qd <dig> labeled es cells was removed for detailed postmortem analysis at day  <dig> post-injection. conventional histology using h&e stains confirmed the intact in vivo differentiation ability of qd labeled es cells in living animals . these in vivo histologic data are concordant with previous in vitro rt-pcr data shown in figure  <dig>  which further suggest that qds do not affect the developmental pluripotency of es cells. however, we could not observe any qds under microscopic level at day  <dig>  likely due to dilution and diffusion effects.

discussion
stem cells offer an exciting new branch of therapy to treat a variety of conditions and diseases. it is therefore important to develop methods to monitor cell survival and location after transplantation. due to its many advantages over conventional organic dyes, qds serve as good candidates to monitor these parameters. in order to evaluate their in vivo ability, we delivered them by using commercially available qtracker. strategies for ex vivo cell labeling by qds include non-specific endocytosis, microinjection, liposome mediated uptake, electroporation, and peptide-based reagents. previous studies have shown that the liposome-based reagent lipofectamin  <dig> had the highest delivery efficiency, but the qds were delivered in aggregates  <cit> . electroporation also delivered qds in aggregates  <cit> , and may even cause cell death. peptide-based qtracker  <cit>  reagents  deliver qds into the live cells, and have been shown to be an excellent and easy tool for studying live cell mobility  <cit>  and cell fusion  <cit> .

in this report, we evaluated es cells labeled with qds using commercially available qtracker for non invasive in vivo imaging in living mice. twenty-four hours after labeling es cells with qds, 72% of the cells were positive. however, by day  <dig> the percentage of positive cells dropped to 4%. this dramatic decrease could be due to the rapid division of es cells  or qd diffusion out of dividing cells over time thus causing a dilution of qd signal. the dramatic decrease in signal is consistent with a previous study that used qds to label human cervical adenocarcinoma cells  <cit> .

another important question is whether qds affect es cell properties  that make them an attractive choice for regenerative therapy. previous studies have shown that qd toxicity is dose dependent with increasing concentrations affecting cell growth and viability  <cit> . however, we were interested in any toxicity caused at concentrations used for labeling cells for in vivo applications. therefore, we examined es cell proliferation and viability at one qd concentration  and observed no significant changes between qd labeled es cells and control unlabeled es cells. this was true for all qds tested: qd  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  these results concur with the study by jaiswal et al. that also showed no adverse effects by qds on the viability, morphology, function, and development of various other cells  <cit> . likewise, we confirmed that qds also had no adverse affect on es cell differentiation based on rt-pcr analysis of germ layer specific genes. implanted es cells are known to form teratoma tumors with a variety of differentiated tissues  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  we found that the teratoma consisted of a variety of tissues including respiratory epithelium, osteochondroid, squamous cell, and immature brain-like neural cell based on histology. this confirmed that qd labeling did not affect in vivo differentiation as well. however, although es cell-derived teratomas were retrieved from the animals, they were not shown to be qd labelled. we believe that the in vivo signal could be due to uptake of qd by neighboring host cells. thus, the poor retention of qds in targets cells may be a problem for long-term tracking, and more detailed analysis are needed to address this issue in the future.

another advantage of qds is their ability to do multiplex imaging of different qds at the same time. however, in our study, es cells labeled with different qds were only capable of being imaged up to day  <dig> after subcutaneous implantation. a likely cause for this could be the loss of signal due to rapid cell division. another possible cause could be serum instability of the qds. cai et al. reported that qd  <dig> lost 14% of its original intensity after  <dig> hours of incubation in mouse serum  <cit> . any loss of signal could hamper detection of qd labeled cells at later time points, especially those that are not within the near-infrared region since signals from these qds will also be mostly absorbed by the skin. for those qds that are in near-infrared region, qd  <dig> and qd  <dig>  the difference in intensity could be due to transfection efficiency since these two qds have similar extinction coefficients and quantum yield according to the manufacturer. however, extinction coefficients and quantum yield data were obtained in vitro and not in an animal setting. moreover, the transfection efficiency was similar across all qds. therefore, we believe transfection efficiency is unlikely to be the cause of the difference in intensity observed in vivo. due to its higher extinction coefficient and wider emission spectra within near-infrared region, only qd  <dig> signals were capable to be imaged in the animals for up to  <dig> days. we observed an increase in signal intensity when using a red shifted excitation laser  to image qd  <dig> labeled es cells. the normal excitation wavelength is  <dig> nm. this was somewhat surprising since the excitation coefficient of qd  <dig> is lower at  <dig> nm than it is at  <dig> nm. that is at  <dig> nm, qd  <dig> absorbs light with less efficiency than at  <dig> nm, so less qds become excited and thus give off lower signal intensities. however, the tissue penetration is much greater at  <dig> nm. therefore, labeled cells that would not have been excited at  <dig> nm could be excited at  <dig> nm. thus, these newly excited cells could contribute to the greater signal intensity seen at the detection wavelength of  <dig> nm.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report the successful demonstration of labeling es cells with qds and imaging these labeled cells in vivo. we have shown that it is feasible to label es cells with qds by q-tracker with high efficiency. after labeling, qds did not affect the viability, and proliferation of es cells, and have no profound effect on differentiation capacity of es cells within the sensitivities of the screening assays used. we tested multiplex imaging in vivo using the maestro system and showed that qd  <dig>  qd  <dig>  qd <dig>  qd  <dig>  qd  <dig>  and qd  <dig> labeled es cells can be detected in vivo using a single excitation wavelength . this versatility makes them good candidates for tumor targeting  <cit> , lymph node  <cit>  and vascular mapping  <cit> , and cell trafficking  <cit>  in small animal imaging. nevertheless, the use of qd in stem cells is only beginning to be explored. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of in vivo multiplex imaging of mouse es cells labeled qds. upon further improvements , qds will have greater potential for tracking of stem cells within deep tissues.
