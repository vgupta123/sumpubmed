BACKGROUND
spounavirinae is a subfamily of the myoviridae, and its members possess a large isometric head  with a long contractile tail   <cit> . an increasing interest in the spounavirinae members can be noted, due to their broad host range and strictly virulent lifestyle  <cit> . according to the current ictv  classification, the spounavirinae subfamily comprises two genera  and a group of orphan phages   <cit> .

bacteria of the genus bacillus are ubiquitous in nature. the genus includes one of the best characterized model organisms, b. subtilis, as well as medically significant human pathogens b. cereus  and b. anthracis   <cit> . phages have been isolated for all members of this genus, providing a unique opportunity to investigate the diversity of phages that infect different hosts within a bacterial genus  <cit> . as of the date of manuscript submission,  <dig> large genome bacillus spounavirinae  have been sequenced and deposited in the ncbi genbank database, of which only phage spo <dig> has been assigned a genus under the current recognized ictv classification  <cit> . the remaining phages are considered orphan phages and their taxonomic position is subject of discussion  <cit> . recently, a “bastille-like group” within the spounavirinae clade was proposed, containing eight bacillus phages  <cit> .

undoubtedly, more spounavirinae phages  will be isolated and there is a need to establish a more defined taxonomic system in order to explore the evolutionary relationships and genetic linkages in these types of phages. the first taxonomic overhaul of the group of phages previously named “spo1-like phages” occurred some years ago and resulted in the creation of the spounavirinae subfamily with two other groups of phages  <cit> . the availability of many new phage genome sequences will enable a more concise classification, as well as the identification of many genetic markers.

in this study we collected and analyzed the complete genome sequences of  <dig> published phages either ictv-classified or candidate members of the spounavirinae subfamily. we confirm the presence of a distinct cluster  in the subfamily, which prompts for a re-assessment of the taxonomic situation. more importantly, we report bastille-like group-specific sequences that could serve as a “signature” for identification of members of the proposed group.

RESULTS
comparative genomics identifies new members of bastille-, spo1- and twort-like viruses in the spounavirinae subfamily
clans analysis
when the genomes of  <dig> phages  were compared using clans, three distinct groups were observed . the first group consists of  <dig> phages including eight recently-proposed bastille-like group phages   <cit> . the second group  includes the entire ictv-recognized twort-like viruses  in addition to other un-classified phages . the spo1-like group represents the third group  and is more distantly related to the other two groups. phages a <dig>  lp <dig>  lb388- <dig> and sp <dig> were considered as singletons .fig.  <dig> clans analysis of a total of  <dig> phages, eight ictv classified spounavirinae phages , and  <dig> unclassified spounavirinae candidates . edge weights were calculated from the p values of the blastn high-scoring segment pairs . the network was visualized after  <dig> runs using the clans software package  <cit> . all analyzed sequences are listed in methodology.



dot plot analysis
whole genome nucleotide  and amino acid sequence  dot plot analysis of the  <dig> phages also revealed  <dig> clusters and singletons similar to the clans analysis result. more detailed analysis showed that similarity at amino acid level was clearly more obvious than at nucleotide level among bastille-like group phages . similar results were reported previously  <cit> .fig.  <dig> nucleotide  and amino acid sequence  dot plot analysis of  <dig> bastille-like group phages in spounavirinae. dot plots were generated using gepard  <cit>  and whole amino acid sequence of phages were retrieved from phamerator  <cit> 



phylogenetic study using single gene products
in order to construct a phylogenetic tree using single gene products, putative major capsid proteins and tail sheath proteins were identified from all  <dig> phages. when the maximum likelihood algorithm was used, three clusters identical to clans analysis were observed .fig.  <dig> comparative phylogenetic analysis of major capsid proteins  and tail sheath proteins  of  <dig> spounavirinae phages using mega v <dig>  <cit>  and muscle programs and the maximum likelihood  method. bootstrapping was set to  <dig> and the unrooted tree was collapsed at a less than 50 % bootstrap value. b, bacillus; br, brochothrix; e, enterococcus; l, lactobacillus; li, listeria; s, staphylococcus




large terminase subunit and dna polymerase sequences were also used for phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . interestingly, two genes were not found in the staphylococcus phages remus and romulus and it was previously reported that they were fragmented by mobile elements  <cit> . thus, when the phylogenetic tree was drawn for the proteins in the remaining  <dig> phages, the clusters did not correspond to the observed clans cluster pattern .

phamerator analysis identified candidate signature genes that are specific for bastille-like group phages
a phamerator database was created using the  <dig> large genome spounavirinae phages with minimum, maximum and mean genome length of 127065 bp , 165238 bp  and 147716 bp, respectively . when the chosen parameters were applied to the dataset, the  <dig> spounavirinae phage genomes containing a total of  <dig> gene products were assembled into  <dig> phamilies  of which  <dig> phams are orphams , or phams with only one gene product. the largest pham  contained  <dig> members. the mean pham size was  <dig>  gene products.

in order to select gene products that were conserved in the bastille-like group phages, phams were identified that only include gene products from bastille-like phages. these included pham  <dig> , pham  <dig> , pham  <dig> , pham  <dig> , pham  <dig> , pham  <dig> , pham  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> phamily circles connecting  <dig> type  <dig> thymidylate synthase  gene products in  <dig> phages ,  <dig> dihydrofolate reductase  gene products in  <dig> phages ,  <dig> dna segregation atpase ftsk/spoiiie gene products in  <dig> phages  and),  <dig> metallo-beta-lactamase gene products in  <dig> phages . phamilies were created when gene products exhibited e-values smaller than 1 × 10− <dig> or greater than  <dig>  % identity with at least one other gene product in the pham. phage bobb encodes two thymidylate synthase homologs  that belong to pham  <dig> 



among those bastille-like group specific phams, pham  <dig> was chosen for further studies as no other group of phages in the database contain a dhfr gene in their genome. in addition, pham  <dig> was also chosen for further studies due to high similarities among the members in the pham. pham members shared more than 43 % identity and e-values lower than  <dig>  × 10− <dig> .

we also analyzed the other bastille-like specific phams . however, we concluded that these three phams are not suitable as the signature gene for the group. it is because members of pham  <dig> exhibit relatively low similarities  among the members and have differently annotated gene names . in the case of pham  <dig>  and pham  <dig> , homologous proteins are found in non-bastille group phages and phylogenetic analysis failed to observe a unique cluster for the bastille-like group .

pham  <dig>  and pham  <dig>  were characterized further due to their significance in phages as agents in biocontrol  .

four types of thymidylate synthase homologs  are found in spounavirinae, and a ts <dig>  can be used as a signature gene for the bastille-like group phages
pham  <dig> contains  <dig> gene products from  <dig> different phages. phage bobb has two genes in the pham; see below. these genes encode a type  <dig> thymidylate synthase   and are only found in the  <dig> bastille-like group phages. percent identities and e-values among the  <dig> gene products are  <dig>  to100 % and  <dig>  x 10− <dig> to  <dig>  respectively. when the  <dig> gene products in pham  <dig> were blast-searched, high percent identity hits  from ts gene products in bacillus spp.  were identified.

bacillus phage bobb contains two members of pham  <dig>  gp <dig> and  <dig> . this was unusual, since all the other members of the bastille-like group encode a single thymidylate synthase homolog. interestingly, protein sequence analysis showed that gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  exhibit  <dig>  and  <dig>  % identities with n- and c-terminus of phage phiagate ts <dig> , respectively . in addition, gp <dig> present in between gp <dig> and gp <dig> in phage bobb encodes intron endonuclease homolog that contains the n-terminal catalytic domain for giy-yig intron endonuclease i-tevi, i-bmoi, i-bani, i-bthii proteins and a c-terminal yig family of class i homing endonucleases c-terminus  . these data suggest that gp <dig> and gp <dig> were originally introduced as one complete ts <dig> fig.  <dig> gene arrangements of the ts and dhfr region with their adjacent genes in bobb and phiagate . the numbers given in the connecting lines are the clustalw alignment values



pham  <dig> contains one member , gp <dig> of brochothrix phage a <dig> . gp <dig> of a <dig> exhibits 36 % amino acid identity with thymidylate synthase of aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus. on the other hand, gp <dig> showed a maximum amino acid sequence identity of 35 %  with bacillus ts.

pham  <dig> has only one gene member  and is found in enterococcus faecalis phage phief24c, a member of twort-like group phages. gp <dig> in phief24c exhibits 36–48 % amino acid identities with ts proteins from enterococcus spp.  and aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus. on the contrary, gp <dig> showed 31–43 %  identity with bacillus ts proteins.

pham  <dig> has six genes  that are found in all five members of spo1-like phages  as well as in sp <dig> , a member of twort-like group. they contain a ts domain and are annotated as ts , deoxyuridylate hydroxymethyltransferase , putative replication protein  or hypothetical protein  in the ncbi database. the members of this pham share  <dig> -100 % identity and e-values from  <dig>  × 10− <dig> to  <dig> . phage ts <dig> proteins are less similar to bacillus ts , and maximum similarities were found with deoxyuridylate hydroxymethyltransferase of lactobacillus murinus .

when the amino acid sequences of ts from spounavirinae phages and bacteria were phylogenetically analyzed, four types of ts were clearly observable; ts <dig> containing ts from bastille-like group phages and bacillus spp., ts <dig> from brochothrix phage a <dig>  ts <dig> from phief24c and enterococcus spp., and ts <dig> from spo1-like group phages, sp <dig> and other bacteria such as rhizobium rhizogenes, lactobacillus muriums, yersinia mollaretii and paenibacillus macerans .fig.  <dig> evolutionary relationship of thymidylate synthases. the thymidylate synthase genes were compared by muscle multiple sequence alignment, and a phylogenetic tree was generated with mega v <dig>  <cit>  using the maximum likelihood  method. bootstrapping was set to  <dig> and the unrooted tree was collapsed at a less than 50 % bootstrap value. a, aneurinibacillus; b, bacillus; br, brochothrix; e, enterococcus; l, lactobacillus; r, rhizobium; p, paenibacillus; s, staphylococcus; y, yersinia




a putative dihydrofolate reducatase  homolog is unique to bastille-like group phages and serves as additional signature gene for the group
pham  <dig> contains  <dig> gene products  which are found in, and are restricted to, all  <dig> bastille-like group phages. blastp analysis using  <dig> gene products in pham  <dig> against  <dig> non-bastille-like group phages did not return any protein with significant homology. global identities and e-values among the  <dig> gene products  are  <dig> –100 % and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> –  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively. when the  <dig> gene products in pham  <dig> were blast-searched, significant hits of dhfr proteins from bacillus spp.  were identified .

b <dig> gp <dig> encoded a putative dhfr, however, the gene size  as annotated in the published genome was much smaller than the average size  of dhfr proteins from other members of the bastille-like phages. when the b <dig> genome was compared with b5s due to their high similarity  <cit> , both phages share 100 % nucleotide identity in the dhfr region. we further observed that the difference in dhfr gene sizes was due to the choice of start codon  used in predicting the orfs in both cases. accordingly, the open reading frame of b <dig> dhfr was modified and used for preparing fig.  <dig> the new gp <dig> of phage b <dig> shares a minimum global identity and e-value of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively, to the dhfr in the other bastille-like phages.fig.  <dig> gene arrangement of ts, dhfr, spoiiie and beta-lactamase genes in phage genomes. a bastille-like group; b singleton; c twort-like group; d spo1-like group. gene location is not to the scale. numbers found in  represent gene designation number in each genome



all the members of bastille-like group phages encode metallo-beta-lactamase and/or spoiiie homologs
the proteins in pham  <dig> were found in only  <dig> members of bastille-like group phages. these genes encode a spoiiie homolog with a minimum identity of  <dig>  % among the pham members . blastp analysis indicated that the spoiiie of the phages in the bastille-like group shared at least 29 % identity  with dna translocase stage iii sporulation protein of b. cereus.

metallo-beta-lactamase gene products  were identified in  <dig> members of the bastille-like group with a minimum amino acid identity of  <dig>  % . bioinformatic analysis revealed that the metallo-beta-lactamase protein of bastille-like group members shared at least 25 % identity  with metal-dependent hydrolase of b. thuringiensis. pham  <dig> was also found in bacillus phage sp <dig>   and shares between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % identity with the bastille-like group phages.

in addition to pham  <dig>  pham  <dig> contained metallo-beta-lactamase domain that was found only in bacillus phage mater , a member of bastille. blast analysis indicated that gp <dig> of phage mater shares 46 % amino acid sequence identity, an e-value 1 × 10− <dig>  and 95 % coverage with beta-lactamase of the facultative anaerobic, endospore-forming paenibacillus mucilaginosus   <cit> .

putative spollle and beta-lactamase homologs are found close each other,  <dig>  to  <dig> orfs  apart and are located within the nucleotide metabolism, replication and transcription modules containing putative rna polymerase sigma factor, chromosome segregation protein, rna ligase, and plasmid segregation protein . with respect to ts <dig> and dhfr region, putative spoiiie and beta-lactamase genes were transcribed in the opposite orientation .

discussion
the spounavirinae are currently composed of the spouna-like virus  group , the twort-like virus group  and unassigned phages . recently, barylski et al.   <cit>  proposed a third group, bastille-like viruses, containing eight members. in addition to eight ictv-recognized spounavirinae phages, we collected the genomes of all  <dig> putative subfamily members currently published as described in materials and methods. when their genome relatedness was analyzed at nucleotide as well as protein levels, three groups were clearly observed.

the spo1-like group contains  <dig> members  that infect either b. cereus or b. subtilis. the twort-like group, includes  <dig> members  with different hosts . the novel third group  includes  <dig> bacillus phages. finally four phages, a <dig>  sp <dig>  lb338- <dig> and lp <dig>  remain orphan phages in the subfamily. revisiting the data presented in other publications, which followed the current ictv-approved classification  <cit> , also supports the presence of a third distinct group among the spounavirinae. together with the previous publication on the possible existence of the third group  <cit> , this convincing evidence prompts for a revision of the grouping within the spounavirinae subfamily.

the bastille-like group phages were isolated from soil, sewage or food using b. cereus , b. thuringiensis , b. subtilis , b. megatrium  or b. pumilus  as host, in different geographical locations . they feature a head diameter of 95 ± 10 nm and tail length of 185 ± 30 nm. their genome sizes range from approx. 127 kb to 165 kb, with g + c content between 37 % and 50 %. among the bacillus phages isolated so far, members of this novel bastille-like group represent about 29 % with an increasing number in isolations recently  <cit> . however, despite their growing population, there is little data on host range, genome structure, and receptors of these phages. these data would be required for more complete classification .table  <dig> characteristics of bastille-like group phages.

the creation of a phamerator database using  <dig> published large-genome spounavirinae helped to identify the bastille-like group-specific gene products, which are ts <dig> and dhfr homologs. these gene products are found in all  <dig> members of the group but not in other groups of the subfamily. while ts <dig> exhibits high similarity  with bacillus ts, other ts types  contain higher similarities with non-bacillus ts, indicating different origins of ts <dig> and the other types of ts. in addition, dhfr homologs are not found in other phages analyzed in this study than the members of the bastille-like group in the database. we propose that ts <dig> and dhfr can be used as signature genes that can distinguish bastille-like group from other groups in spounavirinae.

thymidylate synthase  is a folate-binding enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of one carbon unit to dump using  <dig> -methylene- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydrofolate  as a cofactor to produce dtmp and  <dig> -dihydrofolate   <cit> . dump hydroxymethylase  also catalyzes one carbon transfer from ch2h4folate to dump but produces hydroxymethyl-dump and  <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydrofolate   <cit> . due to their functional differences, ts  activity requires replenishment of h <dig> folate which is catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase   <cit> .

previously, dump hmase was suggested as the signature gene for spo1-like phages which synthesizes hydroxymethyluracil  instead of thymidine  <cit> . in this study we found that dump-hmase may not be exclusive to the spo1-like phages as it appears to present in non-spo1-like phage, sp <dig>  although sp <dig> is outside the spo1-like group phages its genome appears to be modified as reported previously  <cit> . therefore the presence of dump-hmase may still be a signature of dhmu-modified phage genomes.

a more detailed analysis indicated that ts <dig> proteins in bastille-like phages are 289– <dig> amino acids long, which is significantly smaller than ts <dig>  or ts <dig>   but within the range of ts <dig> . in addition, while all ts <dig> genes in bastille-like phages and in bacteria  were annotated as thymidylate synthase, those in ts <dig> were annotated differently in the database. while ts <dig> in phages such as camphawk and jl, and paenibacillus macerans has been annotated as a thymidylate synthase, in other phages  and yersinia mollaretii is was proposed as a dump hydroxymethylase . moreover, ts <dig> in shanette, cp- <dig> and lactobacillus murinus were annotated replication protein, and hypothetical protein, respectively. this finding again underlines the importance of developing universal guidelines for genome annotation. interestingly, all the bastille-like group phages  contain a dihydrofolate reductase near the ts <dig>  these data collectively suggest that ts <dig> is different from ts <dig> and might contain dump hmase activity. in addition, enterococcus phage phief24c and brochothrix phage a <dig> also does not encode a dhfr gene in its genome. clearly, more studies will be required for clarification of the functional differences between ts <dig> and ts <dig> .

bacteriophage genomes usually exhibit a modular structure in which related-genes form a module, which might be transferred together from one phage to another  <cit> . thus, it is likely that closely related-phages have a similar gene arrangement. the ts1-dhfr region in all the bastille-like phages exhibits a nearly identical gene arrangement . the ts1-dhfr region is preceded by putative terminase and endolysin genes, approximately  <dig> and  <dig> orfs in the same orientation, respectively. in addition, ts <dig> is followed by the dihydrofolate reductase gene, two to six orfs apart, in the same orientation . on the other hand, putative recombinase  and putative dna-binding protein  are found upstream and downstream of ts <dig> , respectively, in phage a <dig>  the genes upstream of gp <dig> and the ts <dig> region in phief24c include putative ribonucleotide reductases in the same orientation, while putative terminase and endolysin genes are  <dig> and  <dig> orfs apart in an opposite orientation . in addition, the region downstream of gp <dig> does not contain a dhfr encoding gene . ts <dig> genes are located in the middle of the dna replication/transcription module, usually encoding such enzymes as dna polymerase, sigma factors, rna polymerase, nuclease and primase . these data suggest that ts <dig> in the bastille-like group originated from the same source, which might be different from the source of ts <dig>  ts <dig> and ts <dig> genes.

based on results obtained from clans , dot plot , phylogenetic analysis using single gene products , and coregenes analysis of the proteome , bacillus phage bobb is consistently classified as a member of the bastille-like group. interestingly, two ts-encoding genes  were detected in its genome. further analysis suggested that gp <dig> and gp <dig> could be a part of a gene separated by insertion of gp <dig>  an intron endonuclease homolog . a similar genotype was reported by bechhofer et al.   <cit>  when they discovered an intron in the thymidylate synthase homolog of a broad host range bacillus phage beta  <dig>  the origin of these intron endonuclease homologs in both bacteria and phages has not been fully elucidated. nevertheless, either gp <dig> or a combined protein of gp <dig> and gp <dig> was clustered together with other bastille-like group phages in phylogenetic tree, validating ts <dig> as a signature gene in the group.

bastille-like and spo1-like group phages share the same hosts, bacillus spp. thus, the clear distinction of the two groups based on ts1-dhfr region is very intriguing. other phylogenetic studies such as nucleotide sequence-based clans and single protein sequence-based phylogenetic trees separate bastille-like and spo1-like groups. therefore, it might be suggested that the acquisition of the two signature genes is as old as the divergence of the two spounavirinae groups. in addition, it could provide a possible explanation for the diversities in the bastille-like group phages which was further developed by vertical gene transfer followed by mutations in the region.

although all the bastille-like phages encode ts <dig> and dhfr with significant identities to the ts <dig> and dhfr of bacillus cereus, the gene arrangement inside the ts1-dhfr region is different. no phage contained ts <dig> and dhfr genes right next to each other, as observed in most bacteria including bacillus spp. . there are one  to five putative orfs  in between the genes . taken together, these data suggest that not only vertical gene transfer but also horizontal gene transfer might take place in this region  <cit> .

ts and dhfr are found in the genome of bacillus spp. and not all the bacillus phages have these genes. on the other hand, ts and dhfr are commonly found in all bastille-like group phages and appear to be a part of the phage genome for a long time. this could imply that these genes somehow play an important role in lifecycle or physiology of bastille-like phages. currently, however, the function and the meaning of the products encoded by these two genes in phage genome are unknown and are certainly of great interest for further studies.

due to relatively broad host range and strictly virulent phenotype, spounavirinae viruses received an increasing interest as tools to control harmful bacteria  <cit> . it is generally accepted that phages intended for biocontrol should not feature genes which encode putative virulence factors or may possibly enhance the pathogenic profile of the target bacteria  <cit> . phage genome analysis has allowed for convenient detection of phages encoding or lacking putative virulence factors. in this study, we found that all the members of bastille-like group phages encode a metallo-beta-lactamase protein and/or a spoiiie homolog, which might play a role in host virulence or pathogenesis.

recently, colomer-lluch et al  reported that phage-encoded antibiotic resistance genes can confer resistance to bacteria depending on the strain and environmental factors  <cit> . in addition, a number of phages, including bacillus phage sp <dig>  were reported to affect sporulation efficiency of the host  <cit> . putative sporulation-related genes in some of the members of bastille-like phages were reported previously  <cit> . however, no experiments have proven that phage-encoded gene products are directly related to bacterial sporulation. more studies are required to clarify the role of these genes in the phage genomes. despite the lack of clear evidence that identifies the role of these phage gene products in host virulence, their presence makes the use of these phages questionable as biocontrol agents.

previously, the genomes of two members of the proposed spo1-like group phages, jl and shanette, were also reported to encode tellurium resistance protein  <cit> . interestingly, none of the twort-like phages have so far been reported to contain genes encoding for antibiotic resistance or host survival. these data suggest that, while the functional identity of these genes needs to be verified experimentally for the future, twort-like phages might be better candidates as biocontrol agents.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we analyzed  <dig> complete genome sequences of spounavirinae phages and confirmed the creation of the “bastille-like group” in the subfamily. furthermore ts1- and dhfr-encoding genes were identified to be unique in spounavirinae, which could serve as signatures for the new bastille-like group.
