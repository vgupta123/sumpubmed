BACKGROUND
the pancreas is a mixed gland with an exocrine and an endocrine component. the exocrine portion makes up more than 95% of the volume of the pancreas, the endocrine portion 1–2%
 <cit> . the exocrine pancreas consists of duct, centroacinar and acinar cells, the latter being the most abundant cell type. acinar cells produce digestive enzymes which they secrete into the duodenum via ducts. in  <dig> major pancreatic pathologies, pancreatitis and pancreas cancer, the acinar cells are replaced by duct cells, a process termed acinoductal metaplasia
 <cit> . pancreas cancer has a dismal prognosis: the overall 5-year survival rate among patients with pancreas cancer is less than 6%
 <cit> . exocrine tumours are the most common form of pancreas cancer from which 95% are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas . pdac is thought to arise from ductal precursor lesions, including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias , which accumulate mutations and become progressively dysplastic, finally forming metastatic tumours
 <cit> . many recent studies in mice indicate by genetic lineage tracing that at least a part of pdac and panin arise from acinar cells that are reprogrammed into a preneoplastic state
 <cit> . lineage tracing also revealed acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation, both in caerulein-induced pancreatitis and following pancreatic transforming growth factor alpha overexpression in mice
 <cit> . in addition, cultured acinar cells from mice
 <cit>  and humans
 <cit>  can transdifferentiate to duct cells.

also in the context of diabetes mellitus the acinar cells represent an interesting cell population of the pancreas. diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels which result from defects in insulin secretion, or action, or both. it is a major and growing public health problem throughout the world. beta cell transplantation can restore the functional beta cell mass in diabetic patients but it is seriously hampered by donor shortage. this problem could be solved by generating more beta cells by reprogramming more readily available cell types unaffected by the disease. acinar cells, the most abundant cell type in the pancreas, represent an attractive source for beta cell replacement therapy. lineage tracing studies in vitro as well as in vivo have clearly shown that rodent acinar cells can be converted into functional beta cells
 <cit> . the ability of acinar cells to become reprogrammed is further supported by acinar transdifferentiation into hepatocytes
 <cit>  and adipocytes
 <cit> . their remarkable plasticity and their involvement in  <dig> major pancreas pathologies make acinar cells a highly interesting cell type. obviously, an efficient method for gene delivery in pancreatic acinar cells would be a useful tool for genetic lineage tracing, overexpression and knock-down studies, and for gene therapy. several viral vectors such as adenoviral vectors
 <cit> , lentiviral vectors
 <cit>  and adeno-associated viral vectors 
 <cit>  have been used for gene delivery in pancreas. although long-term and robust gene transfer in pancreas has already been achieved with aav vectors and despite several advantages of aav vectors compared to other vectors such as very low immunogenicity, replication defectiveness, lack of pathogenicity and broad tropism, their major disadvantage of a limited cloning capacity precluded their usage in this study. because of this characteristic, aav vectors are less suitable for delivery of larger genes for lineage tracing or overexpression studies. in this comparative study, we opted for lentiviral and adenoviral vectors, next to lipofection. the different transfection/transduction methods were tested in vitro and in vivo in rat and mouse pancreas. we conclude that vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein  pseudotyped lentiviral vectors are the most optimal for in vitro gene transfer, whereas for in vivo transduction of rodent pancreas, adenoviral transduction reached the highest efficiency.

RESULTS
in vitro transfection of exocrine pancreatic cells is inefficient
primary cultures of exocrine cells isolated from rat pancreas were transfected with  <dig> different commercial lipofection reagents, lipofectamine  <dig>  and effectene . transfection was performed on the day of isolation with pegfp-n <dig>  and the efficiency was determined by analyzing the percentage of enhanced green fluorescent protein + cells. while it is reported that cell lines of the exocrine pancreas could be transfected at high yields using lipofectamine 2000
 <cit> , we found that less than  <dig> % of primary cells were transfected and expressed egfp . when varying amounts of plasmid dna and varying ratios of dna to effectene reagent were used, egfp+ cells appeared  <dig> hours after transfection  but only ≤  <dig> % of total cells expressed egfp on day  <dig> . a similar efficiency was obtained at earlier time points .

in vitro transduction of rat exocrine pancreatic cells using mokola and vsv-g pseudotyped lentiviral vectors
the efficiency of mokola and vsv-g pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was compared in transducing isolated rat exocrine pancreatic cells. transduction was performed on day  <dig>  with a recombinant lentiviral vector that expressed egfp under the control of the ubiquitous and constitutively active cytomegalovirus  promoter  and whose envelope was pseudotyped with glycoproteins either from mokola virus  or from vsv . during culture, egfp was stably expressed  and on day  <dig>  the fraction of egfp+ cells was counted at different moi’s . the efficiency to transduce isolated rat exocrine cells with levsv-gcmv-egfp was  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than with lemocmv-egfp at multiplicity of infection   <dig> and moi  <dig>  transduction with levsv-gcmv-egfp at moi of  <dig> resulted in  <dig>  ±  <dig> % egfp+ cells on day  <dig> .

comparison of in vitro adenoviral and lentiviral transduction of rat exocrine cells
to compare the transduction efficiency of adenoviral  or lentiviral  vectors, rat exocrine pancreatic cells were transduced for  <dig> hours on day  <dig> . after the  <dig> hours transduction period, egfp was already weakly detectable in adenovirally transduced cells , whereas no egfp was observed in the lentivirally transduced cells on day  <dig> . the number of egfp+ cells and the amount of protein per cell increased with increasing moi’s . lentiviral expression of egfp reached a plateau only at day  <dig> . during the first days following transduction, adenoviral transduction of rat exocrine cells resulted in high efficiencies and a very high level of transgene expression, even at moi  <dig>  as compared to levsv-gcmv-egfp . however, from day  <dig> on, massive cell death occurred in the adenovirally transduced cells and the formation of monolayers was disturbed . on day  <dig>  only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of the adenovirally transduced cells survived, while the viability of cells transduced with levsv-gcmv-egfp was comparable to that of non-transduced cells and showed normal monolayer formation and stable transgene expression .

in vivo transduction of pancreatic cells with lentiviral vectors
to investigate the efficiency of in vivo transduction with levsv-gcmv-egfp, viral vectors were injected into the pancreatic parenchyma of cd <dig> mice . a range of  <dig> -  <dig> transducing units  was used. injection of the lectin wheat germ agglutinin coupled to tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate  was previously shown to result in specific binding to acinar cells and served as a control for the injection
 <cit> . pancreata were analysed for lectin labelling and egfp expression by endogenous fluorescence in cryosections of the pancreas and by immunohistochemistry with anti-green fluorescent protein  on paraffin sections on day  <dig> following viral vector injection. under these conditions pancreas histology remained normal. however, while lectin-bound tritc was easily detectable, no egfp could be observed in viral vector-injected pancreata . similarly, no egfp+ cells could be detected  <dig> days following injection of different amounts of levsv-gcmv-egfp in the parenchyme of rat pancreas   . in conclusion, pancreatic cells could not be transduced in vivo by intra-parenchymal administration of lentiviral vectors.

in vivo transduction of pancreatic cells by adenoviral vectors
in contrast with the previous in vitro observations, in vivo administration of adenoviral vectors into the parenchyma of mouse and rat pancreas resulted in high transduction efficiencies. the pancreas of cd <dig> mice  was injected with different amounts of adcmv-egfp  at multiple sites. injection of wga-tritc was used as a control. samples were analyzed at day  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  after injection. on day  <dig> several lobes of the pancreas showed a high expression level of egfp . egfp was already detectable at a dose of  <dig> pfu adcmv-egfp and continuously increased as higher amounts of adenoviral vectors were used. however, even at the highest dose used, some pancreatic regions remained negative. the expression of transgene peaked on day  <dig>  and diminished with time  to reach zero level at day  <dig> . haematoxylin-eosin stainings showed local inflammation and infiltration of leukocytes on day  <dig> with a gradual restoration of normal pancreas histology over time . leukocyte infiltration could no longer be detected at day  <dig> after transduction .

adcmv-egfp  were injected at multiple sites in the parenchyma of wistar rat pancreas. analysis was done at days  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . immunohistochemical detection of egfp revealed that the higher the volume, the more epithelial cells were transduced . at a constant number of viral vectors  in a small injection volume , mesenchymal cells between pancreatic lobes and peripherally located epithelial cells were transduced, whereas with a higher volume  a high transduction efficiency was observed in the centre of the pancreatic lobes . also, with increasing numbers of adenoviral vectors, increasing numbers of egfp+ cells were detected, similar to the results seen in mice . however, some regions remained negative for the transgene as well. as in mice, the reporter expression was maximal on day 3– <dig>  but declined over time more rapidly than in mice  and was completely absent by day  <dig> . clear signs of local inflammation and leukocyte infiltration were present on day 3– <dig> and gradually decreased with time . analysis of consecutive sections showed a clear overlap of inflammatory regions and regions expressing egfp, as expected . double immunohistochemical staining for egfp and amylase revealed that the majority of the transduced cells both in mice and rats are acinar cells. however, also synaptophysin, insulin or glucagon positive islet cells and some keratin 19-positive duct cells were transduced, albeit at a lower efficiency . in summary, injection of adenoviral vectors into the parenchyma of rodent pancreas resulted in high transduction efficiency but was accompanied by inflammation, and transgene expression was transient.

in vivo transduction of pancreatic cells from immune-deficient rodents with adenoviral vectors
in order to further improve in vivo transduction of the pancreas, a preliminary study was conducted to compare immune-deficient with immune-competent rodents. immune-deficient balb/c nu/nu mice  were transduced with 2 ×  <dig> pfu of adcmv-egfp as described above and were compared to wild-type balb/c mice . analysis was done at day  <dig> and at day  <dig> after injection. the preliminary results indicate that the effects of in vivo pancreas transduction in balb/c mice were similar as in cd <dig> mice, with a high level of reporter expression seen on day  <dig> and less on day  <dig>  while areas of the transduced pancreas contained inflammatory cells at both time points. expression of the transgene in balb/c nu/nu mice on day  <dig> was comparable with the immune-competent mice. however, at day  <dig> the expression remained high in the immune-deficient mice and less inflammation was present . also in rats a preliminary comparative study was performed of in vivo adenoviral pancreas transduction in immune-competent   and immune-deficient  animals . all animals received  <dig> x  <dig> pfu. two animals from each group were analyzed on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after injection. the immune-deficient nude rats responded in a similar way as the immune-deficient balb/c nu/nu mice. on day  <dig> after transduction there was no difference in the expression of the reporter between immune-deficient rats and immune-competent rats, but pancreata of nude rats contained much less inflammation . on day  <dig>  egfp expression was low in wistar rats, whereas it remained high in nude rats . in nude rats the structure of the pancreas looked normal by day  <dig> in contrast to wistar rats . even after  <dig> days, expression of the transgene remained high in the nude rats, in contrast to immune-competent animals . in conclusion, pancreatic cells could be efficiently transduced in vivo by intra-parenchymal administration of adenoviral vectors in rat and mouse pancreas. highest efficiency was seen in acinar cells, and pancreatic histology was severely affected in normal pancreas but preliminary results indicated nearly normal pancreas histology in immune-deficient animals.

discussion
in the search for methods for efficient gene delivery into pancreatic acinar cells, we have investigated different viral and non-viral vectors in vitro and in vivo. non-viral in vitro transfection of primary exocrine pancreatic cells only reached very low efficiency. lipofectamine  <dig>  widely used for transfection of cell lines, has, to our knowledge, not been reported before for transfection of exocrine pancreatic cells. many studies indicate very high transfection efficiency in rapidly dividing cells
 <cit> ; while in non-dividing human pancreatic islets lipofectamine  <dig> resulted in low transfection efficiency
 <cit> . we have demonstrated previously that the exocrine cells in our cultures show a very limited proliferative capacity
 <cit> , a possible explanation for the observed low transfection efficiency. another study indicated that trypsin-dispersion of human, rodent and foetal porcine islets increased the efficiency of gene transfer with lipofectamine 2000
 <cit> . our unpublished results showed that enzymatic and non-enzymatic dispersion of exocrine cell clusters had a dramatic negative effect on cell survival. the efficiency of transfections with the non-liposomal lipid effectene in primary cells is dependent on the cell type: some primary cell types were reported to express high amounts of the transgene
 <cit>  while others showed a low efficiency of transfection
 <cit>  comparable to our results.

in general, viral vectors are more efficient than non-viral vectors for gene transfer. one way to alter the tropism of a viral vector is pseudotyping, i.e. the incorporation of heterologous envelope proteins in the vector. the most widely used envelope for lentiviral vectors is vsv-g, as it provides the vectors with a very broad host range, and the viral particles can easily be concentrated by ultracentrifugation. for the in vitro transduction of rat exocrine pancreatic cells, we also tested mokola pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. mokola is a rabies-related virus and belongs to the family of rhabdoviridae, as vesicular stomatitis virus does. mokola pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have been used for the transduction of a variety of cell types, especially brain cells such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes
 <cit>  but also skeletal and cardiac myocytes
 <cit> , satellite cells
 <cit> , skin fibroblasts
 <cit> , retinal pigment epithelium
 <cit>  and alveolar epithelium
 <cit> . with the exception of the study of kobinger et al.
 <cit> , in which only a very limited expression of the transgene was shown in human islet cells, they have not been used for the transduction of pancreatic cells. vsv-g pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have also been used for the delivery of genes into various cell types in vitro, including human and rodent pancreatic islets
 <cit> . however, they have not been used for the transduction of pancreatic acinar cells in vitro. we report that vsv-g pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have an 8– <dig> times higher efficiency to transduce rat exocrine acinar pancreatic cells compared to mokola pseudotyped lentiviral vectors at comparable moi. the transgene expression reached a plateau at  <dig> hours following transduction, remained stable throughout the culture period and did not affect the viability of the cells. adenoviral vectors, on the other hand, have been reported to induce a very early and titer-dependent expression of the transgene in pancreatic acinar cells in vitro with a very high expression level after  <dig> hours
 <cit> , which is comparable to what we observed. therefore, for short-term culture, adenoviral vectors are very efficient in gene transfer. however, later in culture they induced a considerable amount of cell death. this has not been reported in the abovementioned studies, since the acinar cells were mostly kept in culture only for  <dig> hours
 <cit>  and at maximum for  <dig> days
 <cit> .

the results of in vivo intra-parenchymal delivery of lentiviral vectors in the pancreas are in sharp contrast with the high efficiency during in vitro lentiviral transduction. a similar report has been published, in which no significant transduction of the pancreas by intra-parenchymal injection of lentiviral vectors was reported
 <cit> . on the contrary, intra-ductal administration of lentiviral vectors in the mouse pancreas efficiently transduced acinar cells
 <cit> . in vivo transduction efficiencies do not always correlate with in vitro efficiencies
 <cit> . the remarkable difference in transduction efficiency of lentiviral vectors in vitro and in vivo might be explained by lentiviral instability in the presence of serum
 <cit> . lentiviral vectors also have a relatively large virion size which could affect their capacity to perfuse the tissue
 <cit> .

adenoviral vectors have been used previously to transduce pancreatic cells in vivo via different routes: intravenously
 <cit> , intra-ductally
 <cit> , and intra-parenchymal
 <cit> . although adenoviral vectors show a high efficiency of transduction, they also elicit an immune response. our preliminary results in immune-deficient nude mice and rats indicated considerably less tissue inflammation. similar observations have been reported with rag −/− immune-deficient mice
 <cit> .

several mechanisms may account for the transient transgene expression following adenoviral transduction, both in vivo and in vitro. the adenoviral episome may be eliminated in cells that are replicating, since it does not integrate into the host genome. furthermore, acute direct toxicity of adenoviral proteins has been described
 <cit> . also, some adenoviral gene products induce apoptosis
 <cit> . residual expression of adenoviral genes in islet cells in vitro was sufficient to modulate cell death
 <cit> . moreover, it has been reported that the transgene itself also can induce increased cell death
 <cit> . however, in the current study the latter is very unlikely since lentiviral overexpression of egfp did not induce cell death. the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the pancreas after intra-parenchymal delivery of adenoviral vectors and the increased duration of transgene expression in immune-deficient animals indicate that the elicited immune response limited the transgene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that vsv-g pseudotyped lentiviral vectors provide the best transduction efficiency with optimal cell viability for in vitro gene delivery to exocrine pancreatic cells as compared to adenoviral vectors, mokola pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and lipofection. remarkably, direct intrapancreatic injection of lentiviral vectors in rodents was highly inefficient. for in vivo transduction of rodent pancreas, adenoviral vectors were superior and our preliminary results in immune-deficient animals were very promising . mainly exocrine acinar cells were targeted. acinar cells represent an interesting cell type to study in the context of pancreatic pathology and regenerative biology, since their transdifferentiation potential has already been extensively documented
 <cit> . the gene transfer methods that we have developed in this study will be helpful not only to allow genetic lineage tracing but also for gain- and loss-of function studies in order to obtain a better understanding of acinar cell plasticity.
