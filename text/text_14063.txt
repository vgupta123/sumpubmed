BACKGROUND
stress responses in bacteria are mediated by alternative sigma factors and other regulatory proteins. in the gram-negative bacterium e. coli, extensive studies have identified the rpos gene as the factor orchestrating cellular responses to stressful conditions  <cit> . in the low g+c content, gram-positive genera like bacillus, listeria and staphylococcus the alternative sigma factor, σb, is involved in coordinating cellular stress responses  <cit> . in b. subtilis, members of the σb regulon contribute to the microorganism's response to environmental stress conditions such as starvation in stationary growth phase, heat, osmotic stress, repeated freezing and thawing or acid and alkaline shock  <cit> . more than  <dig> stress-responsive genes have been assigned to be under the control of the σb transcription factor  <cit> .

the activity of σb in b. subtilis is known to be post-translationally regulated by a complex network composed of two sequentially linked partner-switching modules  <cit> . the sigb operon consists of sigb itself and seven regulators of sigb  genes. these regulatory genes can either negatively  or positively control σb activity . under normal conditions σb is inactivated by direct binding by the anti-σb protein rsbw. induction of the σb regulon is effected by sequestration of the rsbw protein  by rsbv  thus releasing of the previously complexed σb protein, which then forms the holoenzyme with the core rna polymerase to transcribe genes with σb-dependent specificities  <cit> .

comparative analysis reveals that there is considerable variation in the genome organisation of genes comprising sigb operons in b. subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the overall organization of genes is best conserved between l. monocytogenes, l. innocua and b. subtilis but truncated versions of the sigb operon lacking the rsbr, rsbs, and rsbt are found in b. anthracis, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. given that these bacteria occupy different ecological niches it would be interesting to examine the extent of conservation of the σb regulons amongst these bacteria.

l. monocytogenes is a ubiquitous gram-positive, facultative intracellular bacterium causing severe disease in both animals and humans. l. monocytogenes is well-known for its robust physiology. it is capable of growth at refrigeration temperature, low ph and at high osmolarity. however, relatively little is known about the role of adaptive physiological response in promoting survival and growth of the bacterium in hostile environments. several studies demonstrated that a l. monocytogenes sigb deletion mutant was more susceptible to environmental stresses such as acid stress  <cit> , osmotic stress  <cit>  and carbon starvation  <cit> . a strong σb-dependence has been shown for the osmotic induction of both opuc  and lmo <dig>   <cit> , and for one of the two prfa promoters upstream of prfa  <cit> . furthermore, a deletion in the sigb gene has been reported to affect the virulence phenotype of l. monocytogenes in murine and guinea pig models of infection  <cit> . recently,  <dig> σb-regulated genes have been identified using a customized 208-gene microarray comprising of genes predicted to harbor σb-dependent promoters  <cit> .

even though entry into stationary phase in bhi medium is known to induce σb activity, the exact nature of the inducing signal remains unknown. in this study we monitor σb expression at different stages of growth using quantitative real-time pcr analysis  and immuno-blot analysis at different stages of growth. we examined for genes of the sigb regulon expressed at different bacterial growth phases using whole-genome based transcriptome profiling. a total of  <dig> σb-dependent genes of which  <dig> were positively and  <dig> genes negatively regulated were detected in the presence of the alternative sigma factor σb.

RESULTS
using temporal transcriptome profiling, we identified  <dig> genes in l. monocytogenes egd-e as being differentially regulated by the alternative sigma factor, σb, at four different time points of bacterial growth  in brain heart infusion  broth. these correspond to middle and late exponential phases  as well as early and late time points of stationary phases  of growth, respectively .

analysis of the σb-expression during bacterial growth
we assayed σb expression at the various bacterial growth phases and found that its expression is highly induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h both by qrt-pcr  and by monitoring protein expression levels using a σb-specific polyclonal antibody  in immuno-blot analysis . expression of the σb regulatory protein decreases at the  <dig> h time point and is lowest at  <dig> h, the last time point examined in this study . this expression pattern suggests that in l. monocytogenes, σb probably reflects a requirement in regulating responses to environmental changes during rapid growth.

monitoring σb-regulated genes using a reporter gene fusion assay
to demonstrate that σb acts as a transcriptional activator we examined the σb-dependence of genes seen in the microarray studies by cloning upstream regions from  <dig> σb-up regulated genes and fusing them to a promoterless β-galactosidase gene  derived from b. stearothermophilus on plasmid psog <dig> . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> promoters harbored canonical σb-binding sequences while  <dig> had no putative σb-binding sequences but were nevertheless considered to be σb-regulated on the basis of transcriptome analysis. we verified the dependence of the promoter regions on σb by conducting gene fusion assays. under the growth conditions described in material and methods, we found between 2- and 230-fold more activity in the wild type as compared to the Δsigb mutant strain.

five promoters with putative σb-binding sequences were slightly activated by σb, but did not fulfill the criteria for being σb-dependent . in summary, out of  <dig> promoters tested, we confirmed  <dig> promoters  for σb-dependency .

reevaluation of the consensus binding site for σb
based on the results presented here we infer that the σb regulon comprises  <dig> transcription units. using the pattern gttt-n12–17-gggwaw for σb-binding motif search, we investigated the upstream sequences of the putative  <dig> σb-dependent genes and were able to detect σb-binding motifs in  <dig> of the  <dig> upstream sequences inspected .

the analysis successfully identified  <dig> of  <dig> previously known σb-binding sites  <cit> . a high proportion of predicted σb-binding sites were located upstream of the gene, but in five cases predicted sites were located within the coding sequence .

 <dig> genes were positively controlled by σb and correspond to  <dig> operons, encoding  <dig> genes as well as  <dig> single-gene transcription units . of these  <dig> transcription units,  <dig> harbor a single consensus σb-binding sequence,  <dig> transcriptional units have two σb-binding sequences each and the remaining  <dig> do not contain consensus σb-binding sequences. these are likely to encode gene products whose expressions are probably either controlled by σb-dependent regulatory genes or whose rna is stabilized by rna binding proteins whose activities are σb-regulated such as hfq.

of the  <dig> genes down regulated during σb expression,  <dig> genes were organized in  <dig> operons and  <dig> were single genes. we identified only  <dig> consensus σb-binding sequences among the  <dig> σb-down regulated genes . σb-dependent down regulated genes were solely found in both the stationary phase growth conditions tested, but were not detected in bacteria at the exponential growth phase. it is likely that σb regulates expression of genes that negatively affect  the central metabolism of the cells, as the cells move away from active growth.

chromosomal distribution of the σb-dependent genes
our studies suggest that genes comprising about  <dig> % of the genome of l. monocytogenes are regulated directly or indirectly by σb. chromosomal distribution of the σb-dependent genes revealed an uneven distribution over the genome of l. monocytogenes . 72% of the σb-positively regulated genes  were located on the first third of each replicore. it has been suggested that expression of genes located near the oric is higher in growing cells compared to genes located around the terminus  <cit> . interestingly, the majority of σb-negatively controlled genes  were concentrated on the left replicore.

functional classification of the σb-regulon
considering the candidate genes identified in our study, the σb regulon in l. monocytogenes comprises genes involved in metabolic functions including glucose and amino acid metabolism, solute transporters, permeases, abc transport systems, general stress proteins, cell wall proteins, bile resistance and exclusion and transcription factors . the total number of σb-regulated genes might be underestimated since the transcriptional activity of the strain was monitored only under growth conditions in complex bhi media during the middle and late exponential and the early and late stationary phase. in a similar study that examined the size of the regulon controlled by the master regulator of virulence prfa in strain egd-e, milohanic and colleagues  <cit>  reported a subcategory of  <dig> genes harboring σb-like binding sequences in their respective promoter regions. here, we confirm that  <dig> of those  <dig> genes  are indeed σb-regulated genes. an earlier study reported  <dig> σb-regulated genes identified during growth in the stationary phase  and under salt stress  <cit> . only  <dig> of the  <dig>  genes of that study were detected here. however, that study employed a different strain 10403s and used sequences derived from the genome sequence of strain egd-e as the basis for the design of the array.

in ongoing studies, we examined the global transcriptional response after different shock conditions for l. monocytogenes  <cit>  and found  <dig> heat stress induced genes all of which are present among the  <dig> σb-positively regulated genes found in this study. this suggests the potent role of σb in growth under hostile environmental conditions.

osmolarity, bile and acid response
several genes, including the opuc, abc-like transporter  that are linked to choline, glycine-betaine and carnitine uptake, have been shown to contribute to protection against osmotic stress in l. monocytogenes  <cit> . in agreement with these results, we confirmed the presence of a σb-binding sequence and strong σb-dependent activity in the promoter region preceding the opuca  gene  <cit> . we also found that genes coding for a transport system for di- and tripeptides, dtpt   <cit>  and a peptidase t , were positively regulated by σb. degradation of peptides to their constituent amino acids can serve either as osmoprotectants , or substrates for other amino acids or even as a source of energy.

a member of ornithine cycle, a putative arginine deiminase  based on sequence homology, known to catalyse the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline and ammonia was observed to be under σb control. the ammonia metabolized probably serves as a protectant in other bacteria against acid damage  <cit> , and the citrulline produced might be used to generate ornithine.

further a operon comprising the genes for lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> encoding the bile exclusion system bile was confirmed to be σb-regulated  <cit> . together with the bile salt hydrolase bsh   <cit> , we identified three genes that contribute to neutralization of bile in the gastrointestinal tract.

in this study, we confirmed the extreme sensitivity of the Δsigb mutant to low acid conditions  <cit>  and bile  <cit>  . the presence of specific genes for mediating bile- and acid-resistance in l. monocytogenes probably reflects niche-specific adaptation of this species to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of mammalian hosts.

carbohydrate metabolism
the largest set of hitherto undescribed σb-dependent genes is linked to the biosynthesis of carbohydrates. thus σb-dependent activation of genes encode putative glucose, mannose- and fructose specific uptake systems  are coupled to the up regulation of several enzymes involved in glycolysis including two dihydroxykinases and a dihydroxyacetone kinase phosphotransfer protein  as well as phosphoglycerate mutase .

furthermore, genes coding for naga  and nagb  are involved in the cell wall metabolism leading to the generation of glucosamine-6-phosphate via acetylglucosamine-6-p-deacetylase  and further on to fructose-6-phosphate using nagb, a glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase  <cit> . fructose-6-phosphate can act as initial precursor for the glycolysis pathway. it can be suggested that use of cell wall components such as aminosugar supports metabolism during stress situations, when other energy rich compounds are not accessible.

genes encode enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway including glucose-1-dehydrogenase  as well as the ribose-5-phosphate isomerases  and a ribulose-phosphate-3-epimerase  show σb-dependent regulation. the orf lmo <dig> belongs to the group of genes without a homolog in l. innocua. comparative genome analysis including the recently published l. monocytogenes strains  <cit>  showed that both lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> lie within a region that is specific to l. monocytogenes.

in addition, we found components of pyruvate metabolism pathway to be induced, as seen by the activation of a pyruvate oxidase  and an acetate kinase  that can generate acetyl-coa to enter into the tricarboxylic acid  cycle. finally, we identified two putative nad-dependent dehydrogenases  and a nadph-dependent quinone reductase , both of which were highly up regulated and are probably involved in electron transport and generation of cellular energy for the bacterial cell.

a functional overview of σb-up regulated genes is given in fig.  <dig> indicating a strong preference of categories for carbohydrate/amino acid transport and metabolism as well as for cell wall/membrane biogenesis.

transport of inorganic ions
several transport processes for a range of inorganic ions in l. monocytogenes are under σb control. the gene encoding lmo <dig> resembles low affinity phosphate transporter pita of e. coli which is involved in zn2+ efflux when the ion reaches highly toxic external concentrations  <cit> . in addition to phosphate uptake, the phou gene  encoding a negative regulator of the phosphate regulon was induced by σb.

to regulate the concentration of heavy metal cations such as cadmium, zinc or cobalt, the bacterium might uses another putative transporter lmo <dig> that has similarities to czcd, a proton-driven antiporter system for these divalent cations  <cit> . the orf encoded by lmo <dig> is similar to mgtc of m. tuberculosis and s. typhimurium. mgtc is reported to support bacterial intracellular survival within the macrophages and increase the ability to grow in low mg2+ environments  <cit> .

universal and general stress related genes
all three members of the universal stress proteins  of l. monocytogenes, namely lmo <dig>  lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> are up regulated by σb. using two dimensional gel electrophoresis, lmo <dig> was recently identified, a protein which is induced during acid adaptation and acid stress in l. monocytogenes egd-e  <cit> . in e. coli, usps are proteins that accumulate in cells during stationary phase and during a variety of stress conditions  causing growth arrest in cells. furthermore, usp proteins are required for the management of dna damage and are induced by mutations in the ftsk protein, a cell division protein located at the cell septa and which coordinates chromosomal dimer segregation during cell division resulting in the separation of the daughter cells. here we demonstrate that in l. monocytogenes, ftsk  expression is also σb-dependent, suggesting coordinated expression with usps to prevent chromosomal damage during cell separation.

genes regulated by the σb regulon mediating resistance to oxidative stress include a glutathione reductase encoded by lmo <dig>  for l. lactis it was shown that accumulation of intracellular glutathione conferred resistance to h2o <dig>  <cit> . we also observed and confirmed that the expression of hfq  to be dependent on σb in l. monocytogenes  <cit> . the homolog protein in e. coli interacts with many regulatory srnas increasing e.g. the stability of the srna itself.

recently, it was demonstrated that a Δhfq mutant in l. monocytogenes egd-e is sensitive to osmotic and ethanol stress, and is required for the expression of full virulence in the mouse model of infection  <cit> . furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation using hfq-specific antiserum followed by enzymatic rna sequencing revealed that hfq is able to bind different srna molecules  <cit> .

virulence
previously, nadon and colleagues  <cit>  provided evidence for σb-dependent transcription of the listerial prfa gene  that controls the expression of all known virulence genes. considerable similarity was found between the second promoter sequence of prfa  5'-ttgttact-n14-gggtat-3' and the consensus σb-binding sequence. to support their hypothesis, nadon and coworkers  <cit>  compared the phenotypes of a Δprfap1Δprfap <dig> and a ΔsigbΔprfap <dig> double mutant and showed that the loss of σb activity had the same effects as deletion of the prfap <dig> promoter. as a result, expression of well-characterized prfa-dependent virulence genes such as listeriolysin is induced under stress conditions <cit> . furthermore, prfap <dig> was recently confirmed to be under direct control of σb in a growth phase dependent manner  <cit> .

in this study, we were unable to demonstrate significant expression of inlab genes, whose expression is prfa-dependent. it has been previously reported that the Δsigb mutant  <cit>  is affected in epithelial cell invasion  <cit>  as well as in gastrointestinal infection of guinea pigs  <cit> . here we detected a number of genes predicted to encode cell wall-associated proteins that may adhere to collagen , two other lrr-containing internalin proteins  and predicted cell membrane proteins  all of which are potential candidates for epithelial cell invasion. we also noted that the bsh and bileab genes whose transcription was previously shown to be prfa-dependent  <cit> , were significantly regulated  by σb as previously reported  <cit> . the data suggested strain-dependent differences in responses to various stress stimuli in the various l. monocytogenes strains, an observation that has previously been documented  <cit> .

putative σb-down regulated genes in stationary phase growth
analysis of the expression profiles deriving from the early and late stationary growth phase revealed  <dig> genes down regulated by σb. cog analysis of σb-repressed genes  included different categories which are e.g. involved in translation . other categories of repressed genes were involved in cell cycle control , cell division , cell wall biogenesis  and inorganic ion transport for manganese, copper and cobalt  . σb repression of ribosomal genes rlpd, rpsc, rplw and rpsj and genes encoding cell wall lytic enzymes as well as ion binding proteins was previously reported for b. subtilis  <cit> .

here we report that σb regulates many aspects of growth, such as those involved in translation and cell division processes in l. monocytogenes, during growth in stationary phase, probably representing a physiological response to limiting nutrients. regulation of these genes by σb has been observed before for other gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the presence of a low number of consensus σb-binding sequences  in down regulated genes as compared to  <dig> for σb up regulated genes indicates that repression by σb is often indirect and probably uses other signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulators. since detailed information about the role of σb as a negative regulator is scarce, further studies addressing this topic are needed.

orthologs of σb-regulated genes absent in l. innocua
it was also of interest to determine how many of the σb regulon members of l. monocytogenes egd-e were present/absent in the closely related non-pathogenic l. innocua as this is a free-living bacterium existing in the environment. using the σb promoter consensus-directed search , determined for l. monocytogenes, a majority of genes  were found in l. innocua, which were preceded by this sequence motif and consequently bear a significant homology to orthologs in l. monocytogenes. thus the σb regulon appears to be highly conserved between these two listerial species.

ten genes predicted to be involved in the stress response of l. monocytogenes had no orthologs in the non-pathogenic l. innocua strain. these include lmo <dig> encoding a hypothetical protein as well as lmo <dig> encoding a protein which is a member of a large and ubiquitously occurring family of voltage-gated sodium channels  in bacteria and vertebrates  <cit> . other genes without a homolog in l. innocua were lmo <dig>  and lmo <dig>  both encoding cell wall proteins with an lpxtg motif; lmo <dig>  which is similar to ribose 5-phosphate isomerase; lmo <dig> which encodes the previously described sepa required for septum formation, and lmo <dig> encoding a lactoylglutathione lyase that catalyzes the initial step of the glyoxal pathway. furthermore, two non-orthologous genes were identified as transcriptional regulator genes, lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  the gene product of lmo <dig> harbors a mga helix-turn-helix domain . the second transcriptional regulator  belongs to the arac family and could also be involved in acid response. in e. coli, low ph regulation is also dependent on two arac-like regulators, gadw and gadx  <cit> . the gene products of lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  gada and gade, have been shown to be involved in acid resistance  <cit> . in our study, we confirmed that lmo <dig>   <cit> , another l. monocytogenes specific gene locus, is regulated by σb.

comparative genomic analysis of σb-regulon members
the sigb operon in l. monocytogenes and b. subtilis are highly conserved with respect to structure and sequence similarity among the low g+c containing bacteria  <cit> . additionally, the proposed σb-binding consensus sequence is highly similar between these two species  <cit> . of the  <dig> σb-up regulated genes described in this study, we found  <dig> with orthologs in l. innocua and  <dig> with orthologs in b. subtilis through similarity searches . of these  <dig> orthologous genes in b. subtilis,  <dig> have been previously reported to be σb-dependent in b. subtilis  <cit> . these include well-characterised σb-dependent genes such as, the members of the sigb operon itself and the osmoregulatory opuc operon , csbd, several universal/general stress genes and an arginine deiminase involved in acid tolerance  <cit> . this indicates conservation of a basic core set of stress responsive genes between these two species.

however, a larger set of genes are either disparately controlled between these two species or specific to l. monocytogenes. the former include genes encoding for transporters of di- and tripeptides, pts systems, some genes involved in metabolism such as ribose-5-phosphate isomerase and acetate kinase as well as a large number of hitherto uncharacterized genes in b. subtilis. examples of probable niche-specific σb-regulated genes in l. monocytogenes include internalin h, lpxtg- and lysm-motif containing cell wall proteins, putative collagen binding proteins and bile salt resistance and exclusion proteins  <cit> . in addition, many of the σb-dependent effects are probably under the control of a secondary transcription regulatory circuit.

CONCLUSIONS
we hypothesize that the current size of the σb regulon, comprising  <dig> up- and down-regulated genes and representing approx.  <dig> % of all genes in the listerial genome. this compares with  <dig> genes or  <dig> % of the genes for b. subtilis  <cit> ,  <dig> genes or  <dig> % of the genes of b. cereus  <cit>  and  <dig> genes or  <dig> % of the genes of s. aureus  <cit> , indicating that the alternative sigma factor directly regulates large sets of genes in these microorganisms. σb however must also exert its effect on many genes in an indirect manner, i.e. through control of secondary regulator genes and by inducing genes whose products stabilize rnas posttranscriptionally, e.g through hfq. additional studies employing a variety of stress stimuli and growth conditions will be required to generate a comprehensive catalogue of σb-regulated genes for l. monocytogenes.
