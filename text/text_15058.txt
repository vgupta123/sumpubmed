BACKGROUND
plasmid segregation is a well known phenomenon in recombinant dna biotechnology and major factor reducing the yield of recombinant proteins  <cit> . the loss of multicopy plasmids is thought to be due to the irregular distribution of plasmids between the daughter cells during cell division  <cit> . this results in heterogeneous cell populations in which the plasmid-free cells overgrow the plasmid-bearing cells under non-selective conditions  <cit> . eventually, the overall plasmid content in the populations, and therefore the productivity of cultivations decreases. the imposition of plasmid-free over plasmid-bearing cells depends on the difference between their specific growth rates and on the generation rate of plasmid-free cells  <cit> . these characteristics can be affected by a large number of factors such as mechanism and rate of plasmid replication, plasmid copy-number  <cit> , plasmid multimerization  <cit>  eventually leading to the so called dimer/multimer catastrophe  <cit> , concatameric replication  <cit> , presence of partitioning elements  <cit> , cultivation conditions , host cell genotype  <cit> , etc.

vectors for bacterial gene expression are usually multicopy plasmids with a relaxed control of replication, carrying a strong promoter and a strong ribosome binding site. it has been observed that the extensive gene expression thus achieved causes significant reduction in the specific growth rate of plasmid-harbouring cells   <cit> .

taking into consideration that gene expression includes two consecutive steps, transcription and translation, and also that in prokaryotes these two processes are not separated in space and time, one can assume that each stage interferes with plasmid replication and therefore with its segregation. it was shown for instance that extensive transcription causes a reduction in plasmid copy-number and favours plasmid segregation  <cit> .

the aim of this work is to investigate the segregation of a series of pbr322-based plasmids expressing with different efficiency human interferon-gamma  in e. coli le <dig> cells.

the hifnγ is a cytokine endowed with multiple biological activities  <cit> . it is secreted in the human fluids in minute amounts and due to this it has been targeted by the recombinant dna technology in the early 80's. in this study the hifnγ was chosen as a model because of its importance for the pharmaceutical industry and medicine.

in the investigated plasmids the hifnγ gene was placed under the control of different regulatory elements  in order to vary the efficiency/level of both transcription and translation. to evaluate the impact of these processes on plasmid segregation the models of stewart & levin  <cit>  and lee et al.  <cit>  were employed.

methods
plasmids and bacterial strain
the plasmids used are listed in table  <dig>  the plasmid pp1--hifnγ  is a derivative of pbr <dig> where the fragment between ecori and bamhi restriction sites  gene) is replaced by a cassette containing a strong constitutive promoter p <dig> , a ribosome-binding site  and a hifnγ gene. the mrna transcribed from the p <dig> promoter is dicistronic and consists of the complete hifnγ sequence plus a part of the tet gene . a translation stop codon taa is introduced after the last codon of the hifnγ gene. the plasmids pΔp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ are derivatives of the plasmid pp1--hifnγ. the construct pΔp1--hifnγ was derived from pp1--hifnγ by removing the ecori/hindiii fragment , blunting and ligation of the rest of the plasmid. the plasmid pp1--hifnγ was constructed by removing the sd sequence from the plasmid pp1--hifnγ , blunting and ligation. the construct pp1--hifnγ is derivative of the plasmid pp1--hifnγ in which a cluster of four tandemly repeated sd sequences  was substituted for the single sd sequence. as seen from the map , all plasmids have the phenotype apr,tcs. the plasmid pgem-bd used for the qpcr is described elsewhere  <cit> .

the e. coli strain le <dig>   <cit>  was used as a host strain throughout this work.

lb  medium  <cit>  was used for preparation of competent cells and in the plasmid stability assay.

m <dig> minimal medium  <cit>  supplemented with trace element stock solution , glucose , l-methionine and l-tryptophan  was used for preparation of seed cultures and for both batch and continuous fermentations. the trace element stock solution consisted of  <dig>  g znso4·7h2o,  <dig>  g fecl3·6h2o,  <dig>  g mnso4·h2o,  <dig>  g cucl <dig>   <dig>  g coso4·7h2o,  <dig>  g h3bo <dig> and  <dig> ml 37% hcl per liter.

batch cultivation in flasks
e. coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmids pΔp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ were grown in m <dig> medium containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin in 100-ml erlenmeyer flasks  at 37°c and  <dig> rpm to a <dig> =  <dig> .

cultivation in a bioreactor
e. coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ, pΔp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ were used for batch and chemostat cultivations.

inoculum
single colonies of transformed e. coli le <dig> cells were transferred to  <dig> ml flasks with  <dig> ml sterile m <dig> medium  containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin. the flasks were incubated at 37°c and  <dig> rpm until an optical density of a <dig> =  <dig> - <dig> .

fermentation conditions
batch and chemostat cultivations were performed in m <dig> medium containing  <dig>  g/l glucose  in a biostat® bplus bioreactor  with a working volume of  <dig> ml. the ph value was maintained during cultivation at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  by 2m naoh, temperature and stirrer speed were kept constant at 37°c and  <dig> rpm, respectively. dissolved oxygen was monitored using a po2-elektrode oyferm fda <dig> , and po <dig> was controlled at 80-90% of air saturation by the airflow. feeding of chemostat cultivations was initiated after the initial batch phase  at a constant dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  the inoculum in all experiments was 1% v/v of the final culture volume. samples were aseptically collected at different time intervals and used for determination of cell concentration, plasmid copy number, glucose and hifnγ quantification, as well as for plasmid stability assay.

analytical methods
determination of cell concentration
cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at  <dig> nm  using a ultrospec  <dig> pro visible spectrophotometer . optical density was converted to dry cell mass concentration using a standard curve determined before. to determine dry cell weight bacterial cells were collected from  <dig> ml cell suspension by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c, washed twice with distilled water and dried at 100°c to constant weight.

plasmid stability assay
to determine the fraction of plasmid-harbouring cells, culture samples were appropriately diluted with  <dig> % w/v nacl, spread on lb-agar plates and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. single colonies  were picked with sterile applicator sticks and transferred to lb-agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin. after  <dig> h at 37°c the colonies were counted and the segregational instability was represented as the ratio of colonies growing on ampicillin plates to the total number of transferred colonies .

glucose and hifnγ quantification
samples of 1- <dig> ml bacterial culture were centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the glucose concentration in the supernatant  was determined using a bioprofile  <dig> plus analyzer . the harvested bacteria were lysed by boiling  in  <dig> ml 7m guanidine hydrochloride  and after appropriate dilution of the samples  the content of hifnγ was determined by elisa  using the ready-set-go! kit for human interferon gamma , following the manufacturer's instructions.

hifnγ-mrna determination
the relative content of hifnγ-mrna was determined by hybridization using a 19-nt 32p-labeled oligonucleotide specific for the hifnγ gene as already described  <cit> .

determination of plasmid copy-number
plasmid copy-number  was determined by real-time quantitative pcr  as described by lee et al.  <cit>  using the chemostat cultures of e. coli le <dig> transformed with the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and Δp1--hifnγ. samples were derived  <dig> h after switch to continuous cultivation. total dna was isolated using a qiaamp® dna mini kit , following the method for bacterial cultures. since all plasmids in the current study bear bla gene  and the host e. coli le <dig> cells harbour chromosomal d-1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase gene   the same primers sets, calibrator  and thermal cycling protocol as proposed by lee et al.  <cit> , were used. real-time qpcr amplification was carried out in a rotor-gene™ instrument  using mesa green qpcr mastermix plus for sybr® assay no rox kit  in  <dig> repetitions for each probe.

RESULTS
to study the influence of transcription and translation on plasmid segregation four expression plasmids based on the cloning vector pbr <dig> were constructed. plasmids were designed to express a synthetic hifnγ under the control of different regulatory elements  in order to vary the efficiency of transcription and translation. the plasmid pp1--hifnγ bears a strong constitutive promoter  and a strong synthetic ribosome binding site  thus insuring a high level of constitutive gene expression. in the construct pp1--hifnγ a cluster of four identical sd sequences is substituted for the single sd in the previous plasmid. as shown earlier  <cit> , the repetition of the sd sequence can have a strong suppressive effect on translation and therefore on the yield of recombinant protein. the constructs pΔp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ are derivatives of the plasmid pp1--hifnγ in which both promoter and sd sequence -hifnγ) or the sd sequence -hifnγ) were deleted. therefore, the hifnγ gene in the first plasmid can not be transcribed and in the second plasmid can not be translated. to prove this experimentally e. coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmids pΔp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ were cultivated in flasks with m <dig> medium to a <dig> =  <dig>  and the content of hifnγ and hifnγ-mrna was measured as already described  <cit> . as expected, no hifnγ-mrna and no protein  were detected in cells harbouring pΔp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ, respectively.

plasmid loss kinetics was studied for the four constructs pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ, pΔp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ in m <dig> medium supplemented with glucose in chemostat cultivations. following the initial batch phase, feeding was initiated at a cell density of a <dig> =  <dig> - <dig>  at a constant dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  the fraction of plasmid-harbouring cells in the total cell population versus cultivation time during the continuous phase for the construct pΔp1--hifnγ is presented in figure  <dig>  time dependence of this and other variables  during the continuous phase of cultivation of e.coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ are shown in figures 3a - c.

description of plasmid segregation by the model of stewart & levin
to describe the population dynamics of plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-free cells the nonlinear fitting method of davidson et al.  <cit> , which is based on the equations proposed by stewart & levin  <cit> , was used . these equations describe the growth kinetics of plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-free cells in chemostat culture , which can be combined into a single equation representing the fraction of plasmid-harbouring cells in the population z as a time dependent function . eq.  <dig> includes the parameters Δ  and Θ . employing eq.  <dig> the values of Δ and Θ were estimated for the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ . as the fraction of plasmid-harbouring cells z did not change significantly during cultivation both parameters were not determined for the plasmid pΔp1--hifnγ. the fraction of plasmid-harbouring cells in the total population z versus cultivation time is shown in figure  <dig> for all investigated plasmids.

kinetic description of cell growth and product formation by the model of lee et al
the genetically structured model of lee et al.  <cit>   was employed to describe bacterial growth in a chemostat, hifnγ production and plasmid loss kinetics of e. coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ. since recombinant hifnγ is a non-secretion protein, the concept for intracellular product formation/inhibition, as given by eq.  <dig>  was used.

the model of lee et al. involves numerous parameters whose values were: i) obtained by experiments; ii) taken after consideration; iii) calculated by fitting model equations to experimental data.

parameter values determined by experiments
the maximum specific growth rate μmax in eq.  <dig> and  <dig> refers to the host cells . in the current study a parameter value of  <dig>  h- <dig> was estimated from the growth kinetics of e. coli le <dig> cells cultivated in minimal  medium supplemented with glucose in a batch reactor .

the intracellular plasmid concentration gin  is a linear function of the average plasmid copy-number np. for a representative plasmid size and e. coli cell volume gin can be calculated by eq.  <dig>  <cit> .

the model of lee et al. is based on the assumption that the plasmid copy-number per cell remains constant during the cultivation. employing qpcr  <cit>  the copy-number of the investigated plasmids was measured during chemostat cultivations in m <dig> medium  <dig> h after initiation of feeding, i.e. when a quasi steady-state for the plasmid copy-number was established. the plasmid copy-number values determined under this condition  is considered as corresponding to the np in the model of lee et al. the plasmid copy-number values corresponding to the constructs pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ, pΔp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

the dilution rate d , as well as the inlet substrate concentration sf  were determined experimentally and remained constant for all chemostat cultivations.

parameter values taken after consideration
the exponent m and the maximum intracellular plasmid concentration ginmax in eq.  <dig> describe mathematically the inhibitory effect of the plasmid copy-number on cell growth. both parameters might be highly dependent on some factors related to plasmid structure and host cells genotype, as well as on the cultivation conditions  <cit> . for e. coli lee et al. considered  <dig> and  <dig>  g/l as reasonable for m and ginmax respectively. this ginmax value corresponds to a plasmid copy-number of about  <dig> . palaiomyletou et al.  <cit>  and altinash et al.  <cit>  have used similar values for ginmax, but different values for m, applying the model of lee et al. to describe the cell growth and production of recombinant proteins in e. coli and s. cerevisiae. palaiomyletou et al. set in their calculations m =  <dig>  whereas altinash et al. obtained better results with m =  <dig> . the latter indicates that the m value is of great importance for the adequate cell growth modelling. in the following a ginmax of  <dig>  g/l  was assumed. using nonlinear fitting of the model equations to the experimental data obtained with the plasmid pp1--hifnγ , a value of  <dig>  for m was determined. since the plasmids used in this study have similar molecular characteristics , the same m value was also accepted for the plasmids pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ.

analogously, the exponent n and the maximal intracellular concentration of the recombinant product pinmax define the inhibitory effect of the recombinant product on the growth of plasmid-harbouring bacteria . these two parameters can also be affected by other factors such as properties of the recombinant protein or the genotype of host bacteria  <cit> . lee et al. proposed two values for the product inhibition exponent n: n =  <dig>  and n =  <dig> . based on the maximal recombinant product levels reported in literature, they have proposed  <dig> g/l for the parameter pinmax.

yield of hifnγ expressed in e. coli le <dig> can approach 30% of the total cell protein . considering the gross chemical composition of e. coli cells , and assuming a cell density of  <dig> g dry biomass/l dry biomass  <cit> , the recombinant product concentration was estimated to be of about  <dig> g hifnγ/l dry biomass, i.e. the same pinmax value as used by lee et al. this parameter pinmax represents the maximal intracellular concentration of recombinant product at which the cell growth is impossible, i.e. μ+ =  <dig> . assuming that the maximal intracellular product concentration experimentally determined corresponds to the theoretical value of pinmax,  <dig> g/l and  <dig> were assumed for pinmax and n, respectively.

the monod constant ks in eq.  <dig> and  <dig> is assumed to be equal for both plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-free cells, as proposed in  <cit> . in the following, ks was set as  <dig>  g/l, as proposed by atkinson et al.  <cit>  for e. coli grown in minimal medium containing glucose.

for the overall transcription and translation rate parameters kp <dig> and kq <dig> , as well as for the mrna decay constant kd , the values obtained by lee et al. for the wild-type λdv plasmid replicon  <cit>  were used. furthermore, it was assumed that the cell density parameter ρb  had the same value as in  <cit> , and that the recombinant protein degradation rate constant ke  is negligible. all parameter values are summarized in table  <dig> 

*in the absence of translation -hifnγ) the gene expression parameters are ignored.

**calculating kp <dig> and kq <dig> the specific growth rate μ is expressed in h- <dig> 

***by α = μ/ln <dig>  and eq. , the substitution of kp <dig>  kq <dig> and kd in eq.  <dig> results in eq.  <dig> 

****the m value was determined by nonlinear fitting for pp1--hifnγ and set in the calculations for both pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ .

parameters determined by fitting model equations to experimental data
to determine the exponent m describing the plasmid vector inhibition experimental data for pp1--hifnγ were used. since the hifnγ gene in this construct is transcribed but the hifnγ-mrna is not translated, the monod equation describing the specific growth rate of plasmid-harbouring cells  is simplified and the kinetic relation for recombinant product formation  drops off.

the yield factor yx/s  is assumed to be the same for both plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-free cells  <cit> . since substrate consumption necessary for formation of the recombinant product is low it can be neglected. for the sake of simplicity substrate consumption for the endogenous cell metabolism was also neglected. by batch cultivations of both non-transformed and plasmid-bearing e.coli le <dig> cells a yield factor yx/s =  <dig>  g biomass/g glucose was obtained. different yx/s values were expected however, for chemostat cultivations depending on the dilution rate. seo and bailey have shown experimentally that this parameter decreases with increasing dilution rate, which contradicts the theoretical expectations  <cit> .

the parameter γ in eq.  <dig> represents the efficiency of transcription and translation of the cloned gene and therefore it should have different values for the plasmids pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ. however, for pΔp1--hifnγ  and pp1--hifnγ  γ =  <dig> because of the lack of transcription and translation, respectively.

the relative plasmid segregation rate θ, which is a key parameter in analyzing plasmid segregation, is assumed to be constant in the model of lee et al.  <cit> .

the values of θ, yx/s and γ for the constructs pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ, and the exponent m for the plasmid pp1--hifnγ were determined numerically using experimental data obtained from continuous cultivations. to this aim the model equation system was fitted to the data for the plasmid-harbouring biomass x+, overall recombinant product concentration p and plasmid-harbouring cell fraction z  using the software product berkeley madonna, version  <dig> . <dig>  the initial conditions  are listed in table  <dig> 

experimental data and model simulations for plasmid-harbouring, plasmid-free and total biomass, limiting substrate, recombinant product and plasmid-harbouring cell fraction for the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ are shown in figures 3a-c, respectively.

the calculated curves obtained by the model of lee et al.  <cit>  fit well the experimental data for all investigated plasmids. the root mean square deviation  was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ, respectively.

the estimated values of the parameters θ, yx/s and γ are listed in table  <dig>  a value of  <dig>  for m was determined for the plasmid pp1--hifnγ.

the gene expression parameter γ  depends on the strength of both promoter and ribosome binding site  <cit> . in particular the replacement of the single sd sequence in pp1--hifnγ with a tetrameric sd sequence -hifnγ) led to a sharp decrease in the yield of hifnγ . as seen from table  <dig>  the predicted γ values for the plasmids pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ correlate well with the experimentally observed reduction in the yield of hifnγ.

the model predicts almost identical values of the yield factor yx/s at continuous cultivation conditions for all investigated plasmids .

the plasmid loss probability θ predicted by the model of lee et al.  clearly demonstrates that the alterations in the ribosome binding site  interfere with the segregational plasmid stability. a reverse correlation between the yield of recombinant protein and the segregational plasmid stability was observed.

plasmid segregation
the plasmids pΔp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ carrying different gene expression control elements were studied to evaluate the role of heterologous gene expression on plasmid segregation. results demonstrated that altered control elements led to well distinguished differences in the population dynamics between plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-free cells .

mathematically, the cell population dynamics is influenced mainly by the following two factors: a) difference in the specific growth rate between plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-free cells Δ and b) probability of generation of plasmid-free cells Θ due to the plasmid loss. the latter itself is a function of the specific growth rate of the plasmid-harbouring cells μ+ and the relative plasmid loss rate θ . in some models  <cit>  Δ and Θ are expressed as constants assuming apparent steady-state conditions. in general, however, these parameters are complex functions depending on cell genetics and cell physiology, as well as on the corresponding cultivation conditions  <cit> . in the model of lee et al. Δ and Θ are considered to be functions. the specific growth rate of plasmid-free cells is described by the monod-equation , whereas the corresponding rate of plasmid-harbouring cells depends on the cellular content of both recombinant protein and expression plasmid . in the model of lee et al. the dimensionless probability of plasmid loss θ describing plasmid segregation is assumed to be a constant irrespective of the specific growth rate of host cells and cultivation conditions  <cit> . in the experimental system established here the four plasmids carry the same reporter gene  but different genetic elements  regulating its expression. the altered expression levels  of the recombinant gene led to variations in both the yield of hifnγ and average plasmid copy-number per cell. therefore, it is assumed that these two factors are responsible for the observed differences in the population dynamics between plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-free cells.

population dynamics of e. coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmids pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ
the population dynamics of cells transformed with pp1--hifnγ, pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ was analyzed by the models of stewart & levin and of lee et al.

difference in the specific growth rate between plasmid-free and plasmid-harbouring cells 
the values of Δ were calculated by the equations of stewart & levin . as seen from this table, the highest Δ value was observed for the plasmid pp1--hifnγ and this is correlated with the highest cellular content of recombinant product  and the highest plasmid copy-number compared to the other two plasmids. simulations performed using the model of lee et al. also confirmed the highest specific growth rate difference between cells harbouring pp1--hifnγ and plasmid-free cells .

these results agree with the fact that Δ increases with increasing the yield of recombinant protein and plasmid content in the cell, which is related to the increased metabolic burden of the plasmid-harbouring cells  <cit> .

relative  and specific  plasmid loss rates
the probability of plasmid loss θ was determined by a nonlinear fitting procedure employing the model of lee et al., . the obtained results clearly demonstrate that the activity of the genetic elements  regulating hifnγ gene expression determines  the plasmid loss probability θ. as already mentioned, the genetic modification of these elements resulted in different gene expression levels  and different plasmid copy-number . the question rises of how these two factors affect plasmid loss probability θ.

in general, θ is affected by various factors related with plasmid distribution between the daughter cells during cell division or to the specific growth rate of the plasmid-harbouring cells .

among the factors affecting plasmid partitioning  are the plasmid copy-number np  <cit> , plasmid multimerization  <cit> , concatameric replication  <cit> , presence of partitioning elements in the plasmid  <cit> , host cell genotype  <cit> , etc. in the focus of this study was the average  plasmid copy-number , whose reduction often leads to segregational plasmid instability, i.e. to an increased plasmid loss  ,  <cit> . based on the presented results, however, it seems unlikely that the variations in the segregational instability of the investigated plasmids are related to differences in the copy-number. in especially, there seems to be no correlation between plasmid content and the relative plasmid loss rate θ. moreover, the highest plasmid copy-number value was determined for the plasmid pp1--hifnγ , showing the highest θ value .

it is clear that the level of gene expression and plasmid copy-number interfere with the specific growth rate of plasmid-harbouring cells. both high plasmid copy-number and high yield of recombinant protein result in a decrease in specific growth rate of the plasmid-harbouring cells μ+  as described in the model of lee et al. by eq.  <dig>  as a result the decreased specific growth rate μ+ leads to a decrease in the relative plasmid loss rate θ, respectively to increased plasmid stability  <cit> . however, the observed variation in stability/instability of the investigated plasmids cannot be explained satisfactorily by the difference in the specific growth rate of plasmid-harbouring cells in relation with the level of gene expression and plasmid copy-number. the highest Δ value determined by the model of stewart & levin  for the plasmid pp1--hifnγ should result in a minimal θ value. conversely, a high plasmid loss rate should be expected for the plasmids pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ . in contrast, however, no correlation between μ+ and plasmid loss probability θ  was observed.

μ+ as well as the specific rate of generation of plasmid-free cells Θ can also be presented as time-dependent functions applying the model of lee et al. μ+ predicted by the model of lee et al.  clearly shows that the specific growth rates of the cells transformed with the plasmids pp1--hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ are almost equal and higher than those of the cells transformed with the construct pp1--hifnγ . the time course of Θ according to the model of lee et al.  confirms the tendency already reported for Θ values obtained by the model of stewart and levin .

the observed relative plasmid loss rate  of the expression plasmids used in this study is difficult to be explained by either the alterations in the plasmid copy-number  or gene expression efficiency . this is an indication for the existence of other factors that might interfere with plasmid segregation. it can be assumed that hifnγ gene expression influences significantly plasmid segregation  on the level of plasmid distribution during cell division . the latter might be related with the specificity of prokaryotic gene expression itself. unlike in eukaryotes, the three processes replication, transcription and translation in prokaryotes are conjugated and all occur in one compartment . this enables interactions between molecules that are principally engaged in different processes . it is shown for instance that the initiation of the chromosomal dna replication in e. coli is dependent on transcriptional activation  <cit>  where a direct interaction between dnaa  and rna polymerase is found  <cit> . moreover, szambowska et al.  <cit>  provide evidence that during the initiation of λ phage dna replication the λo protein  interacts directly with the β subunit of the bacterial rna polymerase. therefore, it might be assumed that especially in the presence of a strong constitutive promoter and a strong sd sequence  the plasmid is easily involved in a very complex aggregate consisting of replicating plasmid, growing mrna, translating ribosomes/polysomes and growing polypeptide chains. apparently, the risk of a non-random distribution of such huge complexes between the daughter cells is much greater compared to the naked  plasmids and might be influenced by many other factors. among the latter are the structure and aminoacid composition of the recombinant protein, its solubility in the bacterial cytoplasm, the affinity to the cell membrane, etc. if the growing polypeptide chain is hydrophobic or bears an n-terminal secretion signal, it might "stick" to the plasma membrane. membrane association on the other hand is a predisposition for a non-random partitioning and changes in the probability for appearance of plasmid-free cells and therefore relative plasmid loss rate θ. a potential factor promoting non-random plasmid partitioning could also be the formation of inclusion bodies , typical for the expression of many eukaryotic genes in bacteria. usually, they have polar localization and could entangle growing polypeptide chains.

population dynamics of e. coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmid pΔp1--hifnγ
the plasmid pΔp1--hifnγ lacks the promoter and therefore the inserted hifnγ gene is not active. as seen in figure  <dig>  this plasmid demonstrated an extremely high segregational stability . the same figure shows that the next stable plasmid is the construct pp1--hifnγ , where the recombinant protein is also not synthesized. comparing the obtained results one can estimate the impact of transcription only. figure  <dig> shows that the inactivation of translation  shifts the segregation curve to the right. however, compared to the hifnγ producing plasmids -hifnγ and pp1--hifnγ), this does not prevent the plasmid segregation. the latter happens only after interrupting the transcription. this phenomenon might be explained by a mechanism proposed by stueber & bujard  <cit> , who showed that extensive transcription interferes with plasmid replication and leads to a reduction in plasmid copy-number and segregational plasmid instability  <cit> . in this study, however, the plasmid copy-number of the transcriptionally inactive construct -hifnγ) was lower  compared to that of the other three plasmids, i.e. the complete inactivation of the hifnγ gene did not result in an increase in plasmid copy-number but had a strong stabilizing effect against segregation. apparently this result cannot be explained by the above mentioned mechanism and agrees well with the hypothesis raised in this study about the possible role of the extensive constitutive gene expression on plasmid segregation. when interpreting these results, however, one should take into consideration that the data obtained by stueber & bujard  <cit>  refer to chloramphenicolacetyltransferase  expressing plasmids and those presented above concern plasmids expressing a hifnγ gene. in both cases a high level of expression can be achieved  but the two proteins differ in their solubility in bacterial cytoplasm . in future studies  we aim to shed more light on the relationship between plasmid stability/instability and the intracellular state of the expressed protein.

results of simulation studies using the model of lee et al
the model of lee et al. was employed for simulations  to study different trends that can be expected for chemostat cultivation of e. coli le <dig> cells transformed with the plasmid pp1--hifnγ at different dilution rates.

CONCLUSIONS
transcription and translation of hifnγ gene interfere with plasmid segregation. switching-off transcription protects cole1-like plasmids against segregation. however, the plasmid copy-number is not increased compared to other plasmid constructs tested. an increase in constitutive gene expression decreases the segregational plasmid stability . however, this is neither due to a decrease in the plasmid copy-number nor to an increase in the specific growth rate of the plasmid-harbouring cells. therefore, constitutive gene expression seems to be a major factor interfering with cole1-like plasmid segregation. a model of lee et al. , which describes growth and product formation kinetics of recombinant e. coli le <dig> cells expressing constitutively hifnγ in chemostat culture, allowed fitting of experimental data. to our knowledge, this is the first application of the model of lee et al. for experimental studies of plasmid segregation in chemostat culture.
