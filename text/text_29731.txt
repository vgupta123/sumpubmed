BACKGROUND
currently, the prenatal ultrasound has become a constant routine in the veterinary diagnostic centers. the benefits allow us to plan an adequate management during the duration of pregnancy, to predict the most probable date of birth, to evaluate the fetal viability and the development and best date to perform an elective cesarean section. in contrast with the human medicine, that uses the fetal biometry, the veterinary medicine uses the morphological and embryonic annexes analysis in order to predict the gestational age and gestational monitoring. the length of canine pregnancy ranges between  <dig> and 64 days, but can occur in some occasions with a range between  <dig> and 71 days  <cit> . despite all the ultrasonography advantages, there is little information available regarding standardization of dimensions and sonographic anatomy aspects of several organs in adults and fetuses in a variety of animal species of different breeds.

the three-dimensional  ultrasonography, available in medicine for over ten years enabled great advances in the area of imaging diagnostic, mainly in obstetrics and gynecology. the 3d ultrasonography facilitates the volumetric study of organs and structures, besides it provide a third image plane, the coronal plane, which allows more precisely volumetric calculation mainly those of irregular shapes  <cit> . the 3d ultrasonography is still a new technique in veterinary medicine and few are the scientific papers that report its experimental use.

during the pregnancy course occurs maternal hemodynamic modifications including the changes in maternal renal volumetry. the kidneys grow about  <dig> –  <dig>  cm for most renal vasculature. the renal volume increases 30% due an increase in renal plasmatic flow and glomerular filtration rates resulting an increase in cardiac debt, decrease in renal vascular resistance and increase of the seric hormonal levels. the canine renal ultrasonography provides valuable anatomical information regarding the size, shape and internal architecture of the kidneys, which can be obtained even in the presence of a poor renal function or abdominal fluid  <cit> .

the assessment of renal volume by 3d ultrasonography is the great importance in an attempt to bring a new comprehension about the maternal hemodynamic modifications during the course of the pregnancy and the application of this new method in dogs, besides comparing this new technology with the conventional two-dimensional  ultrasonography.

RESULTS
of the  <dig> bitches initially selected,  <dig> were excluded due the impossibility of performing the analysis because of advanced gestational age  and elevated number of fetuses . these bitches showed puffy breathing pattern and excessive restlessness during the ultrasound scan and the fetal images overlapped in renal topography, which resulted in an unsatisfactory quality. for these reasons, the study was limited to the 40th day of pregnancy.

the sample selected in this study was composed by  <dig> bitches with average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   years, ranging from  <dig> to 4 years. it was found that  <dig>  of those bitches weren’t pregnant. among the  <dig> bitches remaining , the number of fetuses ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  in the total number of bitches,  <dig>  were in their first pregnancy. in the group of the  <dig> remaining bitches , the number of previous pregnancies ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> 

it were collected for this study  <dig> volumes by the first examiner  being  <dig> of the left kidney. the renal volume was assessed by 2d ultrasonography method  in all of the cases, corresponding to a sensitivity of 100%. for the 3d ultrasonography method using the virtual organ computer-aided analysis   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> volumes could be evaluated; corresponding to a sensitivity of  <dig> %.  <dig> volumes of the right kidney could be assessed by 2d method, corresponding to a sensitivity of 80%. for the vocal  <dig> and  <dig> methods,  <dig> volumes were assessed, corresponding to a sensitivity of  <dig> %.

the second examiner  collected  <dig> renal volumes, being  <dig> of the left kidney. the renal volume was assessed by 2d method  in all of the cases, corresponding to a sensitivity of 100%. for the vocal  <dig> and  <dig> methods,  <dig> renal volumes could be assessed, corresponding to a sensitivity of  <dig> %.  <dig> volumes of the right kidney could be assessed by 2d method, corresponding to a sensitivity of  <dig> %. for the vocal  <dig> and  <dig> methods,  <dig> volumes were assessed, corresponding to a sensitivity of  <dig> %.

taking the right side in consideration, the renal volume in the day  <dig> was equal to which was found in the 1st to 20th gestational days  and lower than at the 21st to 40th gestational days . the renal volume found in the 1st to 20th gestational days was lower than at the 21st to 40th gestational days . taking the left side in consideration, the renal volume in the day  <dig> was lower than at the 1st to 20th gestational days  and 21st to 40th gestational days . the renal volume in the moment 1st to 20th gestational days was equal to the moment 21st to 40th gestational days  .

in relation to the method reproducibility, we observed good intraobserver reproducibility with icc values closest to  <dig> . for the interobserver reproducibility, a weak concordance was observed between the examiners with icc values closest to  <dig>  the examiners presented an reasonable concordance in the measure at: 1) right side, vocal 30°, day 0; 2) left side, ellipsoid technique, day 0; 3) left side, vocal 30°, 21st to 40th gestational days; and 4) left side, vocal 12°, day  <dig> .

discussion
the possibility of using the 3d ultrasonography as a imaging method in veterinary medicine would be extremely useful, especially because of its image quality and its volumetric results being in many matters compared to the magnetic resonance imaging   <cit> , because for the animals, the mri and the computed tomography  are necessary general anesthesia in order to be performed, which often prevents the patient be evaluated and/or diagnosed. the importance of volumetric measurement is related to follow the evolution of specific diseases and following of each individual patient, which is often done subjectively, through correlation with other anatomic regions  <cit> , because of the difficulty in establishing reliable standard parameters in variety of species and breeds and by the difference between the conformation of the thorax and abdomen in animals of same weight. so, we considered of great importance new ways that allow this evaluation. these new image techniques should be easy and fast and with a good accuracy when performed.

in this study were performed three measurements by each examiner of every method using the average for volumetric calculation in resemblance to other described in the literature  <cit> . we used the ellipsoid formula for the 2d method. the length was assessed in the longitudinal plan and the width and depth in the axial plan  <cit> . regarding the techniques, it was chose to be compared, the 2d and 3d ultrasonography methods using the vocal 12° and 30°. several studies in human medicine also compared the rotation angles of vocal method, some of which indicate that the use of 30° is fast and has good efficacy  <cit>  and others that indicate that a greater number of the rotation steps increase the accuracy of method  <cit> .

in  <dig> bitches the right kidney volume couldn’t be calculated  resulting from the presence of gas in right kidney topography, probably by a failure in the requested fasting or aerophagia which corresponded to  <dig> of non-collected volumes  concerning the first examiner  which is consistent with other authors, due the relation between the right kidney with the descendent duodenum portion and ascending colon which cause bigger reflection and attenuation of the sound beam prejudicing the image formation  <cit> . all the remaining volumes  were submitted to the 2d method by the first examiner, having lost only of two volumes of the measurements relating to rejoinders by vocal 30° and 12° methods, with a success of  <dig> % of the measurements related to the 100% of 2d technique.

in our study, the mean of renal volume  was respectively for the right and left of  <dig>  cm <dig> and  <dig>  cm <dig>  this result indicates that the right kidney has a volume  <dig> % bigger than the left kidney. this is a result that can be confronted and extrapolated with the results of other authors; cause indicates the renal volume of normal non-pregnant bitches. some studies founded a significant difference in which the left kidney has a bigger volume than the right kidney and other ones did not find this difference  <cit> . the total renal volume was calculated as  <dig>  ml/kg with a variation of  <dig>  to  <dig>  ml/kg  <cit>  and taking in consideration that a golden retriever bitch weights an average of 30 kg, the value would be of 105 ml  with very wide confidence level. in other study with dogs of  <dig>  to 45 kg, the authors found an average of renal volume of  <dig>  cm <dig> <cit> , this result was similar to the present study. thus, some authors claim that despite the correlation of the linear measurements by ultrasonography, the high standard deviation is a limitation  <cit> . taking these limitations in consideration its use can be considered sufficiently precise for the clinic use in dogs. in this study, the standard deviation was lower in the observations by vocal, independently of the observer, side or moment. we believe that the differences between right and left renal volumes observed in this study occurred because of the short time among the assessments. the period of 20 days probably was enough to significant changing in the renal volume of pregnant bitches. only future studies with a greater range among the ultrasound scans and greater number could reach definitive conclusions.

the difference was, in average, of  <dig> % increase in renal volume during the pregnancy course, less significant than the 30% found in human medicine literature  <cit> , although is a result unknown in bitches which should be investigated in a study with larger sample. these data indicate that there is a real necessity of studies to give a better understanding of the gestational physiology in animals, because we found renal volumetric alterations consistent with probable morphological and functional alterations during the gestation similarly to what happens with women, this subject should be further investigated aiming the bitch life quality besides in the commercial and economic viability of the pups.

the 3d ultrasonography techniques presented, in average, the same renal volumes independent of the side and moment. this result must be investigated in other study, because it was expected that the vocal 12° method had more accuracy than the 30°. this study did not find correlation between of renal volumes in the day  <dig> neither with the maternal age nor with the number of previous gestations. it was expected that sequential pregnancies could permanently increase the volume independently of side or technique.

there was little correlation between the first assessment of the first examiner  and the assessment of the second examiner  with intraclass correlation coefficients near  <dig>  it’s important to emphasize that these results, probably had occur because of the wide confidence intervals resulting from the low sample size. it should be noted that each examiner evaluated your own volume  differently of the many studies in human medicine in which the second examiner evaluates the collected volume by the first examiner . nowadays, the correct form to assess the reproducibility between different examiners is that the ultrasound scans are realized in different moments, with different conditions. when the ultrasound scans are realized in the same conditions, for example in the same volumes, the correct name is repeatability. the fact of our ultrasound scans were realized in different conditions becomes our results of high value to be used in the clinical practice. there is not until this moment any study regarding interobserver reproducibility of volumetric measurements by 2d and 3d ultrasonography in dogs.

3d ultrasonography presents some gains to be used in the practical clinic as the superiority of image; more accuracy t in volume calculate; short time to realized the exam and less operator-dependent than 2d ultrasonography. our experience showed that the unsuccessful in the 3d volume scanning occurred in the same cases that the quality of the 2d wasn’t the ideal as has occurred with the lost right kidney volumes. the volumes had very good quality, however they weren’t equals to the mri or ct image scans, because the animals were not anesthetized. therefore, we observed that the volumetry obtained by 3d ultrasonography was similar to 2d ultrasonography and therefore with sufficient accuracy for the clinical practice, without the necessity of general anesthesia. considering these observations, the volume calculation by vocal method proved to be useful and precise regarding to the conventional technique. we indicate the vocal  <dig> method because it presents best correlation among validity, reliability and realization time of the ultrasound scan.

as limitations of the 3d ultrasonography we can mention the necessity of training for the achievement of the volume and standardization of its collecting methods to prevent the loss of the spatial orientation of the organ or structure; decreased volume quality by the presence of movement which requires a cooperative patient or sedation in cases of restless animals; increased formatting and interpretation time of the stored volumes; optimized software configuration for the human body and relatively high equipment cost.

we believe that the assessment of renal volume of pregnant bitches by 3d ultrasonography using vocal can be used to monitor the renal function during the pregnancy, mainly in cases of chronic diseases as diabetes and arterial hypertension. these conditions usually can modify the normal renal function and the renal volume by 3d ultrasonography can detect early alterations.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this was a preliminary and pioneer study in the assessment of renal volume in pregnant dogs. these initial results open new perspectives of studies that can compare the organs volumetry in sedated animals by the ct scan with the results obtained by 2d and 3d ultrasonography.
