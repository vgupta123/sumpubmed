BACKGROUND
in paramyxovirus-host cell fusion the virion membrane and host cell membrane are first brought into close contact and docked to each other. this occurs with the help of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase on the surface of the virus, which binds to the sialic acid-containing receptor on the surface of the host cell. this interaction triggers the latent fusion protein  trimers inserted by their carboxy-terminal end into the virion membrane to undergo conformational changes. this exposes their hidden amino-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide domains. the now exposed hydrophobic viral fusion peptides insert into the host  cell membrane. thus, they anchor the virion to the host target cell. two close-by anchoring fusion proteins then fold, this time so that their two trimeric membrane-bound hydrophobic domains  align in an anti-parallel fashion to form a structurally strong 6-helix bundle. this power stroke brings the virion membrane and the host cell membrane together and leads to exoplasmic virus-host cell fusion followed by formation and expansion of the initial pore between the virus and the host cell. uncoating of the virus ends up with entrance of the viral rna and its nucleoproteins into the host cell  <cit> . thus, the viral fusion protein helps the viral envelope to fuse directly with the plasma membrane of the target cell  <cit> .

compared with the understanding of the virus-host cell fusion and entry of the virus into host cell , insight into the molecular mechanisms of the formation of virally induced syncytia  is at a rudimentary level. fusion of the membranes of the virus-infected cells with those membranes of adjacent uninfected or infected cells results in the formation of a giant virus factory, a syncytium, with the additional advantage from the viral point of view of not destroying the exploited host cell. some pioneering studies have focused on the lipid, glycoprotein and protein compositions of the target cell membranes and their ability to promote the formation of syncytia  <cit> . such studies are hampered by the fact that the lipids, glycoproteins and proteins and their receptors on the mammalian cell surfaces of are much more complex than the most elaborate virion membranes and their constituents. we hypothesized that, good fusion molecule candidates of mammalian origin, which could contribute to virally induced host cell-host cell fusion, would be such molecules that have already been recognized in other, non-virally induced cell-cell fusion events.

fusion of gametes to form the zygote cell requires "a disintergrin and a metalloproteinase" molecules known as adam <dig> and adam  <dig>  <cit> ; and the myoblast fusion to myotubes requires adam <dig>  <cit> . macrophage progenitor cell fusion to osteoclasts seems to require adam <dig>  <cit> , adam <dig> and adam <dig>  <cit> . we have reported that adam <dig>  <cit> , adam <dig>  <cit>  and adam <dig>  <cit>  are involved in the fusion of monocyte/macrophages to foreign body giant cells. some adams  contain a putative fusion peptide in the cysteine-rich domain that is involved in membrane fusion in the formation of multinuclear giant cells and osteoclasts  <cit> . a fusion peptide penetrates the lipid bilayer of the cell. thus, the anchoring fusion peptide propels the cell so close to the target cell membrane that the cell fusion is triggered. we have focused in particular in adam <dig>  whereby it was of interest to clarify whether it has the potential to fuse, not only macrophages, but also other cells. such a system might furthermore provide a novel method for study of cell fusion in general. thus, adam <dig> was selected as the candidate molecule and was studied for its eventual presence and regulation in virally induced human cell-cell fusion. it is not known whether adam <dig> is regulated or utilized by viruses for spreading their offsprings to uninfected cells and whether this represents an option for the virus to invade additional cells.

our working hypothesis was that, human parainfuenza virus type  <dig> , typically forming syncyta, might utilize and/or induce transmembrane adam <dig>  a protein linked earlier to the formation of osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells. to test this hypothesis, we added hpiv <dig> to green monkey kidney  cells and to examine human salivary gland cell lines  to study whether host cell-encoded adam <dig> is involved in the fusion of target cells. the results led to the insight that the hpiv <dig> induced cell fusion system could provide a novel human cell-based experimental system of study regulation of cell fusion-associated molecules in general.

RESULTS
adams in hpiv2-infected gmk cells
green monkey kidney  cells are in virological laboratories used for maintaining the hpiv <dig> stocks. therefore, the effects of hpiv <dig> on gmk cells were studied first. when these cells were infected by the hpiv <dig>  viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase antigens were found in infected cells and multinuclear syncytia were formed  <cit> . in these preliminary experiments, the eventual involvement of adams was studied by using affinity purified polyclonal rabbit anti-human adam <dig> antibodies. the human specific adam <dig> antibody did not show cross-reactivity with the corresponding green monkey kidney cell , whereby adam <dig> could not be assessed.

at  <dig> hours hpiv <dig> antigens were not yet found in infected gmk cells  and adam <dig> was absent . on culture day  <dig> hpiv <dig> was seen in infected gmk cells and all the infected and some of the uninfected gmk cells were adam <dig> positive . on culture day  <dig> hpiv <dig> had infected most gmk cells and had caused cytopathic effects including formation of large multinucleated syncytia. the multinuclear giant cells were relatively strongly labeled for adam <dig> . the positive controls of adams were positive showing that the immunolabeling protocol used worked acceptably; also the negative staining controls were negative showing that the adam <dig> staining results were correctly positive .

this is in line with our previous study demonstrating that human adam <dig> might as a human protein participate in the formation of multinuclear osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells  <cit> . however, due to the technical limitations of the hpiv2-gmk system , it was decided that further attempts be done using target cells of human origin.

adam <dig> expression in the hpiv <dig> infected hsy cells
hpiv <dig> infection of gmk cells gave promising results but adam <dig>  our main target of interest, could not be shown in these monkey cells using anti-human antibodies. human submandibular cell line hsg was then used, but it was not possible to infect hsg cells with hpiv <dig>  no hemagglutinin-neuraminidase antigens were found in hsg cells in co-cultures with hpiv <dig> virus and no syncytia were formed. as hpiv <dig> is a paramyxovirus, and the virus causing mumps  with clear preference to human parotid glands, next a human parotid gland cell line hsy was tried.

in the uninfected hsy cells a very weak adam <dig> signal was seen . at  <dig> hours hpiv <dig> was not yet found in hpiv <dig> infected hsy cell cultures and adam <dig> showed weak staining . on culture day one, hpiv <dig> was seen inside hsy cells, which usually also showed cytoplasmic patches of immunoreactive adam <dig> . on culture day three hpiv <dig> was found in some hsy cells. in addition, many large multinucleated cells were seen, which also were hpiv <dig> positive. in double label studies they stained for adam <dig>  with a relatively strong signal, and a non-homogenous, granular and patchy cytoplasmic distribution . in morphometric analysis, without hpiv <dig> stimulation the percentage of adam <dig> positive cells at  <dig> hours was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, at  <dig> hours  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and at  <dig> hours  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. in hpiv <dig> infected cultures of human hsy cells the percentage of adam <dig> positive cells at  <dig> hour was  <dig>  ± 3%, at  <dig> hours  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , at  <dig> hours  <dig>  ± 11%  and at  <dig> hours  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . all hpiv <dig> infected cells were also adam <dig> positive. we then calculated the percentages of adam <dig> and hpiv <dig> double positive cells and obtained that way also the number of adam <dig> positive but hpiv <dig> negative cells . moreover, adam <dig> positive cells formed also bi- and multinuclear cells. fusion was seen already on day one at which time  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the cells were binuclear and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % were multinuclear . on day  <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the cells were binuclear  and altogether  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of all cells were multinuclear  .

expression of adam <dig> hpiv <dig> infected cell cultures was studied using the rabbit anti-human adam <dig> carboxy-terminal antibody as it was reasoned that the antibody recognizing the intracytoplasmic carboxy-terminal end of the molecule would provide an idea of the amount of the full-length adam <dig> molecule, with the amino-terminal propeptide and metalloproteinase domains, as well as its amino-terminal end trimmed counterparts. indeed, in non-infected hsy cells the proportion of adam8-positive cells was relatively low and stable over time. in contrast, hpiv <dig> clearly and dramatically up-regulated adam <dig> expression, which in only  <dig> days increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . apart from this dramatic up-regulation of host cell encoded adam <dig>  two other interesting observations were made in these experiments. first, this increase in adam <dig> expression was accompanied by the formation of binuclear cells and very soon also of multinuclear syncytia. by kinetic association between the increased adam <dig> expression and cell-to-cell fusion it was concluded to indicate that hpiv <dig> induces this tentative host fusion molecule for enhancement of host-host cell fusion. this conclusion is in part based on the general role of adam <dig> in such fusion processes in the formation of osteoclasts  <cit>  and foreign body giant cells  <cit> . it can also be asked whether this host-host cell fusion could provide some survival advantages to the hpiv <dig> virus. interestingly, it was noticed that at the beginning of the culture period most of the adam8-positive host cells were negative for hpiv <dig> hemagglutinin-neuraminidase antigen indicating that they were non-infected. however, it is also conceivable that the detection of nucleocapsid protein, the most abundant viral protein, would have raised the number of cells identified as hpiv2-positive. cells, which were not immunoreactive for hpiv <dig>  were often seen in close association to the hpiv2-immunoreactive mononuclear, binuclear and multinuclear cells apparently ready to undergo fusion with their infected partners. the infection of host cells by hpiv <dig> triggers some unknown mechanisms which initiate cell fusion process and these mechanisms seem to lead to up-regulation of host cell adam <dig>  which might contribute to the cytopathic cell fusion. this suggests that hpiv <dig> utilizes host encoded adam <dig> to spread from infected to non-infected target cells. on the cell surface, host cell fusion molecules, like adams, could cause the hpiv <dig> infected host cell membrane to fuse with the neighboring non-infected cells to form syncytia. this strategy might enable fusion of dozens of non-infected cells to a giant multi-nuclear cell which means that hpiv <dig> can use resources of many more cells compared to an infection of only one cell although "syncytial" infected cells will lose viability much faster than do "non-syncytial" infected cells. at the same time, this syncytial virus factory protects against host-derived anti-viral antibodies, complement and other host defense factors, unable to penetrate to the host target cell cytoplasm upon virus reproduction. however, expression of an adam <dig> protein in mononuclear prefusion cells and multinucleated cells does not mean that it functions as a fusion protein in this context although there is evidence for this in human osteoclastogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates for the first time the up-regulation of adam <dig> during hpiv <dig> induced cell fusion. using a trojan horse strategy of this kind hpiv <dig> can spread efficiently and safely, possibly in part by utilizing the fusion molecules of the host cells. mammalian cell fusion has been studied by others and by us in human monocyte cultures stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand, which however is quite a time consuming and complicated system  <cit> . it was therefore the aim of the present work to assess if hpiv <dig> infected human cells have a potential to utilize also host cell fusion molecules in the fusion process as the first step towards the development of a novel tool for studying fusion of human cells although the characteristics of this system were not clarified by this work.
