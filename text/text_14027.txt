BACKGROUND
tuberculosis remains one of the major causes of concern related to human health because of increasing incidence of mortality and morbidity all over the world. mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium bovis are the two pathogens, responsible for the disease in humans and animals respectively. the emergence of drug resistant strains of m. tuberculosis and failure of the current drug regimen has worsened the situation even more  <cit> . this has prompted renewed efforts to search for potential drug targets. in addition to this, there is an urgent requirement to bridge the massive gap in our understanding of pathogen’s complex biology to fight against disease.

most of the studies on nitrogen metabolism have been focused primarily on other actinomycetes such as streptomyces and coynebacterium because of their role in industrial production of glutamine  <cit> . nitrogen assimilatory pathways are very poorly understood in mycobacterial species, especially m. bovis. studies related to nitrogen metabolism in pathogens may help in understanding of complex cellular mechanisms by which m. bovis survive in nitrogen stress inside the macrophages. glutamine and glutamate are the two major amino acids that act as cellular nitrogen donors for synthesis of biomolecules inside the cell  <cit> . hence, stringent regulatory pathways control the synthesis of glutamine and glutamate inside a bacterial cell  <cit> . in mycobacteria, assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and its conversion to glutamine and glutamate is carried out by glutamine synthetase  and glutamate synthetase  <cit> .

virulent forms of mycobacteria secrete huge amounts of extracellular gs enzyme and are also known to possess poly-l-glutamine  layer in the cell wall. the plg layer is absent in cell wall of saprophytic mycobacteria e.g. m. smegmatis. earlier, the treatment of m. tuberculosis with an inhibitor of gs, l-methionine-s-sulfoxamine, or with antisense oligonucleotides to glna <dig> mrna, has been shown to inhibit plg formation in the cell wall  <cit> . it indicated indirect involvement of glna <dig> gene encoding the gs enzyme in the formation of plg layer in m. tuberculosis. later it was reported that expression of m. bovis gs in m. smegmatis resulted in synthesis of plg layer in the cell wall and plg significantly contribute strength to the cell wall against chemical and physical stresses such as lysozyme, sds and sonication  <cit> . because of its presence exclusively in the cell wall of virulent mycobacteria and its role in providing cell wall strength it would be interesting to study the factors that can affect plg synthesis directly or indirectly.

in view of the fact that formation of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia is a highly energy consuming process, glna <dig> gene is tightly regulated both at transcriptional and post translational levels in m. tuberculosis <cit> . m. bovis and m. tuberculosis glna <dig> sequence exhibits 100% identity . it has been previously reported that there are two promoters upstream to the glna <dig> gene in m. tuberculosis <cit> . the size of transcript in low nitrogen condition was  <dig> nucleotides while the same was around  <dig> in high nitrogen conditions, so it was speculated that transcription starts from different promoters in different nitrogen conditions. in high nitrogen conditions the level of transcript is one fifth of the transcript level in low nitrogen conditions  <cit> . however, since then, effect of the two promoters when present independent of each other on glna <dig> expression in varying nitrogen concentrations has not been studied till date. comparative analysis of the mrna levels transcribed from the two promoters when they are present independent of each other, in response to varying nitrogen concentration, may reveal interesting information about gene expression in pathogenic mycobacteria. in low nitrogen conditions, glnr protein acts as a positive regulator for glna <dig> gene in actinomycetes species  <cit> . it binds to upstream sequence of glna <dig> and activates transcription during nitrogen starvation . furthermore, in high nitrogen conditions to evade the depletion of cellular glutamate levels due to conversion of all glutamate to glutamine the gs enzyme is modified post translationally  <cit> . in case of the nitrogen sufficiency, glne protein acts as a negative regulator and it adenylylates the gs enzyme at a conserved tyrosine residue at  <dig> position  <cit> . hence, the adenylylated form of gs becomes inactive .

in this study, we investigated the behaviour of glna <dig> gene of m. bovis both at the mrna and protein levels in response to nitrogen availability. the present study emphasizes on the effect of nitrogen concentration on expression levels of glna <dig> gene from the two different promoters when present independently or together. we have also studied the effect of nitrogen concentration on plg layer synthesis in the cell wall of mycobacteria.

methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions
the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  m. bovis and m. smegmatis strains were routinely cultured in 7h <dig> broth  supplemented with 10%  albumin, dextrose and catalase ,  <dig> %  glycerol and  <dig> %  tween  <dig>  at 37°c with shaking at 150 rpm. escherichia coli dh5α  was used for cloning experiments. e. coli dh5α was grown in luria-bertani medium. kanamycin was used at concentration of 25 μg/ml for mycobacteria and 50 μg/ml for e. coli strains.

selection marker resistant to ampicillin  and kanamycin .

for creating low and high nitrogen conditions, mycobacterial strains were grown in 7h <dig> medium  containing  <dig>  mm ammonium sulphate and 60 mm ammonium sulphate respectively. it has previously been reported that a change in nitrogen concentration from 3 mm to 60 mm leads to a reduction in gs activity in wild type m. smegmatis <cit> .

the wild type m. smegmatis strain used in the study was complemented with only pmv <dig> vector and was used as a vector control. all work involving virulent strain was performed in bio-safety level- <dig> laboratory at jawaharlal nehru university, new delhi.

cloning of m. bovis glna <dig> gene with its native promoter and construction of its deleted promoter variants in m. smegmatis
cloning was performed using standard procedures. the glna <dig> gene with its upstream promoter region  was amplified using m. bovis genomic dna as template. for pcr amplification of the gene, forward primer  <dig> with bamhi site and reverse primer  <dig> with psti site , were used. the amplified dna fragment was cloned in pgem-t easy pcr cloning vector, verified by sequencing and named as pds <dig>  the insert was excised from pds <dig> by restriction digestion with bamhi/psti, and then ligated in pmv <dig>  e. coli-mycobacterium shuttle vector, producing pds <dig> plasmid. the resulting construct pds <dig> was electroporated into wild type m. smegmatis strain and the transformed strain was named msfp.

the glna <dig> promoter of m. bovis contains two regulatory promoters p <dig> and p <dig> . for the generation of construct carrying only the p <dig> promoter with glna <dig> gene downstream, the p <dig> promoter was deleted by direct pcr method. a forward primer  <dig> with bamhi site immediately from the start of the p <dig> promoter and reverse primer  <dig> with psti site at the end of glna <dig> gene  were designed and were used to amplify glna <dig> gene which lacked the p <dig> promoter. the amplified  product was cloned in pgem-t easy vector  and then sub-cloned in pmv <dig> vector at bamh1-pst <dig> sites  . following this, for generation of construct carrying only p <dig> promoter with glna <dig> gene, p <dig> was deleted by the inverse pcr. in this method a primer was designed such that the sequence containing the p <dig> promoter was excluded. a forward primer  <dig> and reverse primer  <dig> were designed from the 3′ end of p <dig> promoter and 3′ end of p <dig> promoter respectively. pcr amplification by using template pds <dig> resulted in the amplification of whole vector containing glna <dig> gene with p <dig> promoter  . the amplified pcr product was ligated after 5′ kinasing by t <dig> polynucleotide kinase and then the resulting construct was named as pds <dig>  the constructs pds <dig> and pds <dig> were then electroporated in wild type m. smegmatis and hence transformants obtained were named as msp <dig> and msp <dig> respectively.

growth patterns of recombinant m. smegmatis and m. bovis strains in low and high nitrogen conditions
log phase cultures of m. smegmatis and m. bovis strains were inoculated in 7h <dig> medium containing low and high nitrogen conditions. the cultures were grown at 37°c at 200 rpm. the optical density was measured periodically at 600 nm.

semi quantitative rt-pcr and real time pcr
m. smegmatis and m. bovis strains were grown in low and high nitrogen conditions and total rna was isolated by trizol method. in brief, semi quantitative rt-pcr was performed using one step rt-pcr kit  according to manufacturer’s instructions. for glna <dig> gene, forward primer  <dig> and internal reverse primer  <dig> was used to amplify 400 bp fragment of the gene by using dnase i treated rna as template. a siga gene fragment was amplified using primers  <dig> and  <dig> as a loading control. the pcr conditions were, 50°c for 40 min, 94°c for 15 min and 24 cycles of 94°c denaturation for 30 sec, 58°c annealing for 30 sec and 72°c extension for 30 sec.

for real time pcr, dnase i treated rna was taken for cdna synthesis using high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit  employing random hexamer primers. the pcr reactions were run in abi prism 7500ht sequence detection system  using the following program: 95°c for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95°c for 10 sec, 60°c for 10 sec and 72°c for 10 sec. the forward primer  <dig> and reverse primer  <dig> were used for glna <dig> gene. the primer  <dig> and  <dig> were used for siga gene and was used as internal control for data normalization. each reaction was performed in triplicates. the relative changes in gene expression was calculated using the 2-∆∆ct method and the data was represented in the form of fold change in gene expression, normalized to siga gene and relative to the control condition.

determination of gs expression and activity
extracellular activity
all strains were grown in low and high nitrogen conditions. the m. smegmatis strains were cultured for 2 days while m. bovis was cultured for 12 days. then the culture filtrate was harvested. the culture filtrates were passed through  <dig>  μm syringe filter and then concentrated  <dig> times of the original volume using 30 kda molecular weight cut off amicon filter . the gs activity in the extracellular protein fraction was measured by γ-glutamyl transfer reaction as described previously  <cit>  and was expressed as micromoles hydroxamate formed, based on a standard curve obtained with pure γ-glutamylhydroxamate purchased from sigma.

intracellular activity
for the cytoplasmic protein fractions, cell pellets were taken and washed with 50 mm tris–hcl ph  <dig>  and digested with 10 μg/ml lysozyme. cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm tris–hcl with 1x protease inhibitor. the m. smegmatis cell suspensions were sonicated on ice for 5–10 minutes while the m. bovis cell suspension was sonicated for 30 minutes, because the cell wall of virulent mycobacteria are relatively more resistant to physical stress like sonication. the gs activity in the cellular fraction was measured by the above mentioned protocol. the intracellular protein expression was determined by sds-page and western blotting by anti-gs antibody. the amount of total protein was measured by bradford assay and equal amount of total protein was loaded for each sample.

isolation and estimation of plg in mycobacterial strain
cell pellet of exponential phase culture  of all strains was harvested after growing in low and high nitrogen condition and cell wall was prepared. the plg was purified as reported earlier  <cit> . the cell pellet was suspended in 10 ml of breaking buffer. the suspension was sonicated in an ice bath for 3–4 hrs.

the cell lysate was treated with 20 μl of 10 μg/ml ribonuclease and  <dig> units of deoxyribonuclease and kept overnight at 4°c.

treated cell lysate was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 20 min, and the resulting cell wall-containing pellet was extracted with 2%  sodium dodecyl sulfate  for 2 h at 60°c to remove soluble protein and membrane. the extracted cell walls were washed extensively with pbs , distilled water and 80%  aqueous acetone to remove sds.

cell walls were suspended in a small volume of pbs and placed on a discontinuous sucrose gradient composed of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 60%  sucrose.

the gradient was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 2 hr.

the cell wall was settled at the  <dig> to 40% interface, whereas the associated plg pelleted to the bottom of the tube.

the plg material was transferred to a tube containing 80% percoll  in pbs- <dig> % tween  <dig> and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 20 min.

this allowed formation of a gradient in situ and distinct banding of the insoluble, pure plg. the presence of plg was confirmed by gc-ms analysis, after hydrolysis of the samples at 110°c for 20 h with 6 n hcl followed by esterification with heptafluorobutyryl isobutyl anhydride  <cit> . gc-ms was done at advanced instrumentation research facility, jnu new delhi by shimadzu gc-ms  <dig>  and rtx- <dig> ms capillary column  with an oven temperature range of 90-180°c  at 4°c/min raised to 300°c at 4°c/min. the injection temperature used was 280°c along with an interface temperature of 290°c. ms data were analyzed in the nist <dig> lib and wiley <dig> lib chemical libraries.

immunogold localization of plg by transmission electron microscopy
immunoelectron microscopy was performed to confirm the presence of plg in the cell wall of m. smegmatis and m. bovis strains grown under different nitrogen conditions. immunogold localization was done as described earlier  <cit>  at the transmission electron microscopy facility, advanced instrumentation research facility, jnu, new delhi. briefly, cells from log-phase cultures of m. bovis and m. smegmatis strains were harvested and washed with  <dig>  m phosphate buffer. the cells were treated with immune gold fixative , then washed and embedded in  <dig> % agar. the agar-encased bacteria were then dehydrated and embedded using lr white resin . thin sections  were obtained using leica ultracut  and collected on nickel grids . for localization, monoclonal anti-plg antibody   was used. the grids were washed and subsequently treated with gold  conjugated - anti mouse igg. mice pre-immune serum was used as a negative control. the immunolabeled sections were stained with uranyl acetate and viewed using a jeol 2100 f transmission electron microscope  at an acceleration voltage of  <dig> kv.

biofilm formation
biofilm formation was observed by growing static cultures of mycobacteria without shaking in 7h <dig> medium without tween  <dig> at 37°c. biofilm formation was assayed by crystal violet staining method developed by reicht et al. <cit> . briefly, 200 μl of stationary phase cultures  were added to 7h <dig> medium in polystyrene culture plates for biofilm formation and in culture tubes for pellicle formation. after incubation of static culture of m. smegmatis strains for 2 days and m. bovis for 2–3 weeks, biofilm was quantified by removing the medium carefully and staining with 1% crystal violet for 45 min. the wells were washed three times with water and air-dried. the dye was solubilized with 80% ethanol and a <dig> was measured.

RESULTS
generation of glna <dig> promoter variants
figure  <dig> shows a schematic representation of the deletion variants of the promoter. m. bovis contains two native promoters p <dig> and p <dig> within 320 bp upstream of glna <dig> gene . 124 bp upstream of glna <dig> start codon was taken as p <dig> promoter. further, from 320 bp upstream sequence, 31 bp  was deleted from the native promoter and taken as p <dig> promoter. the native, p <dig> and p <dig> promoter with glna <dig> gene were used for further characterization in response to nitrogen limitation and excess.

growth characteristics
m. bovis strain was grown in low and high nitrogen medium and growth profile was studied by measuring optical density at 600 nm. no significant difference was observed in the growth of m. bovis when cultured in low nitrogen medium as compared to growth in high nitrogen medium . this indicated that m. bovis was able to acquire nitrogen from other sources in the medium . same was the case when growth of wild type m. smegmatis and msfp was studied in low and high nitrogen conditions . comparable growth profile was observed for all the strains in both low and high nitrogen conditions, clearly indicating that low nitrogen conditions doesn’t hamper the growth of the strains.

relative quantification of glna <dig> transcript of recombinant m. smegmatis strains
semi-quantitative rt-pcr assays were performed with rna obtained from different strains grown in low and high nitrogen condition. m. smegmatis strain  showed up-regulation of glna <dig> transcript in low nitrogen as compared to high nitrogen condition. the glna <dig> transcript of m. bovis was also higher in low nitrogen than in high nitrogen condition, while msp <dig> had no effect on glna <dig> mrna level in different nitrogen conditions .

real time pcr was performed further to study glna <dig> expression quantitatively in low and high nitrogen conditions for msfp, msp <dig>  msp <dig>  wild type m. smegmatis and m. bovis strains. the glna <dig> expression levels in wild type m. smegmatis in low nitrogen condition was taken as the reference point in order to calculate the fold change in recombinant strains. the data obtained from real time pcr was normalized to siga expression levels, as an internal control. it was observed that in case of nitrogen starvation, the expression of glna <dig> gene in msfp and msp <dig> strains was highly up-regulated. it was observed that in msfp glna <dig> expression was ~  <dig> fold high in ammonium starvation, while it was just ~  <dig> fold more in high nitrogen conditions as compared to wild type m. smegmatis  . in msp <dig> glna <dig> expression in low and high nitrogen conditions was up-regulated ~  <dig> and ~  <dig> fold respectively. the glna <dig> expression in msfp in high nitrogen was ~  <dig> fold less than expression in low nitrogen while the same was only ~  <dig> fold in msp <dig>  in case of msp <dig>  the expression of glna <dig> gene was comparable in both low and high nitrogen conditions. in case of m. bovis, the expression of glna <dig> was also ~  <dig> fold up-regulated in low nitrogen conditions as compared to ~  <dig>  fold in high nitrogen conditions. hence it was observed that in the strains, msfp and m. bovis, where both the promoters p <dig> and p <dig> were present upstream to glna <dig>  the difference in the gene expression levels in low and high nitrogen conditions were significantly higher as compared to the difference in expression levels in strains having single promoter. it was concluded that deletion of any one of the two promoters decreased the stringent regulation of glna <dig> gene at the transcriptional level.

gs specific activity and expression in response to nitrogen limitation and excess
response to nitrogen availability for gs enzyme was studied by measuring cellular gs activity by γ-glutamyl transferase assay  <cit> . exponential phase culture of msfp, msp <dig>  msp <dig>  wild type m. smegmatis and m. bovis was harvested and cell pellet of 10 ml culture was further used for determining intracellular gs activity. upon exposure to the nitrogen limiting conditions, the cellular gs activity in m. bovis, msfp, msp <dig> and msp <dig> was  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> times higher than the high nitrogen condition respectively. intracellular gs activity for all strains grown in high nitrogen condition was much less as compared to the activity in low nitrogen conditions . intracellular gs specific activity in msp <dig> strain was  <dig> u/mg in low nitrogen and  <dig>  u/mg in high nitrogen condition which was much less as compared to gs activity in msfp and msp <dig> strain. the gs activity in extracellular fraction followed the same trend in all strains . western blotting of the intracellular protein fraction was done by using anti-gs antibodies . it was observed that in all strains the gs expression was higher in low nitrogen condition than high nitrogen condition. although it was observed from western blotting result that the amount of gs in low nitrogen condition of msp <dig> was very less but the activity of the enzyme was relatively higher than the activity of the enzyme in high nitrogen conditions of all the strains. this is in accordance with earlier findings that in high nitrogen conditions glne protein adenylylates the gs protein at a conserved tyrosine residue and hence, the enzyme becomes inactive.

estimation of plg from m. bovis and recombinant m. smegmatis strains
effect on cell wall plg in response to nitrogen availability was studied by isolation and estimation of plg layer. for this the strains were grown in low and high nitrogen conditions and then the cell wall was isolated. it was observed that no pellet settled in the sucrose gradient when m. bovis, msfp, msp <dig> and msp <dig> strains were grown in high nitrogen medium . hence it was concluded that the plg content in the cell wall was drastically reduced  when m. smegmatis and m. bovis strains were grown in high nitrogen medium. in high nitrogen conditions, most of the gs enzyme inside the cell is in adenylylated state  <cit>  and thus it may become inactive and unable to form plg layer. although in case of limiting nitrogen conditions, plg was obtained from the cell wall of m. bovis, msfp, msp <dig> and msp <dig> strains. for wild type m. smegmatis, no plg was obtained from the cell wall in both low and high nitrogen conditions, as expected. gc mass analysis of the purified material confirmed the presence of plg .

data are mean ± sd of triplicate sample and are representative of three independent experiments.

immunogold localization of plg by transmission electron microscopy
in order to validate the above observation, immunogold localization study was done to localize plg in the cell wall. exponential phase cultures were taken for localization studies. gold particles were observed at the cell periphery of bacteria gown in nitrogen limiting conditions . while no gold particles were seen at the cell periphery of mycobacterial strains grown in high nitrogen condition, as expected. interestingly the less number of gold particles was found in the msp <dig> strain as low amount of gs expression and plg formation.

effect on biofilm formation
it was earlier reported that a ∆glna <dig> strain of m. bovis that lack plg layer in the cell wall was found to be defective in biofilm formation  <cit> . our studies on biofilm formation were found to be in accordance with earlier reports. msfp and m. bovis strains were defective in forming biofilm in high nitrogen on a polystyrene surface. both strains showed ~ 25% reduction in biofilm formation in high nitrogen condition as compared to low nitrogen condition while m. smegmatis strain showed no difference in the biofilm formation . the pellicle formation for the msfp and m. bovis strains were also significantly less in high nitrogen as compared to the low nitrogen condition . interestingly, the pellicle formation by m. smegmatis strain complemented with m. bovis glna <dig> was enhanced than the wild type. it reiterates the involvement of glna <dig> in modulating the cell surface properties of mycobacteria  <cit> .

discussion
nitrogen metabolism has been studied in detail in industrially important organisms such as streptomyces and corynebacteria but there have been very few reports on nitrogen metabolism of mycobacterial species. earlier, several studies have reported that glna <dig> gene is up-regulated in nitrogen starvation in m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis <cit>  but this study emphasizes on behaviour of glna <dig> locus of m. bovis at both transcriptional and translational levels by altering nitrogen concentration in the medium. also nitrogen conditions modulate the cell wall properties by altering synthesis of plg layer in mycobacteria.

the conversion of glutamate to glutamine demands high energy consumption inside the cell. because of this reason the expression of glna <dig> gene is tightly regulated in most mycobacterial species. the transcription of glna <dig> gene is regulated in m. tuberculosis by dual promoters  <cit> . the p <dig> promoter, present just upstream to glna <dig> gene is low nitrogen responding promoter while the p <dig> promoter, upstream to p <dig> is high nitrogen responding promoter  <cit> . further regulation is driven by glnr protein which has putative binding site in the p <dig> promoter. glnr binds to the p <dig> promoter and activates transcription during nitrogen starvation  <cit> . in this study, we have studied the expression level of glna <dig> gene of m. bovis in response to nitrogen availability, when the two promoters p <dig> and p <dig>  are present independently or together. the real time data observed are in accordance with the earlier findings about the regulation of glna <dig> gene at transcription level in response to nitrogen availability  <cit> . the results clearly showed up-regulation of glna <dig> expression in m. bovis and msfp strains in low nitrogen conditions as compared to high nitrogen conditions. msfp, msp <dig> and m. bovis strains have p <dig> promoter upstream to the glna <dig> gene and p <dig> promoter has binding site for glnr protein. glnr binds to the p <dig> promoter and activates transcription in low nitrogen conditions  <cit> . this may be the reason for the differences observed in the expression level of the gene in low nitrogen and high nitrogen conditions in these strains. while, on the other hand in msp <dig> strain there was no difference in glna <dig> expression level in low and high nitrogen conditions. this may be due to lack of p <dig> promoter and hence glnr binding site. also, it can be observed that the difference in gene expression in low and high nitrogen conditions are higher in msfp and m. bovis strains that have both the promoters upstream to the glna <dig> gene. this difference is somewhat reduced in msp <dig> and completely lost in msp <dig> strain. it has been reported earlier that p <dig> promoter in m. tuberculosis is σ  <dig> type promoter  <cit> . σ  <dig> is expressed in nitrogen limiting conditions, it recognizes the p <dig> promoter and transcription starts from p <dig> promoter.

in addition to regulation at the transcriptional level, gs enzyme encounters a second regulation at post translational level. glne protein adenylylate the gs protein in high nitrogen condition and thus makes it inactive  <cit> . in all the strains, the difference in gs activity in ammonium starvation to ammonium pulse was significantly higher than the difference in expression at mrna level. hence, this marked difference observed in gs activity with change in nitrogen conditions in m. bovis, msfp and msp <dig> may be because of two possible reasons. first, there is a stringent regulatory mechanism exhibited by glnr protein at the transcriptional level because of which the transcript of glna <dig> gene itself, is significantly low in high nitrogen conditions. secondly, after translation, glne protein comes into play and modifies the gs enzyme in high nitrogen conditions which makes gs enzyme inactive  <cit> . msp <dig> strain showed low expression of glna <dig> gene as compared to the expression in other strains in low nitrogen condition because there was no regulation at transcriptional level due to lack of p <dig> promoter hence lack of glnr binding motif also.

plg layer has been known to be present in the cell wall of only virulent strains of mycobacteria  <cit> . harth and colleagues indicated that extracellular gs of pathogenic mycobacteria is involved in synthesis of this layer  <cit> . there has also been reports stating the involvement of plg layer of m. bovis in cell wall strength and in providing resistance to various physical and chemical stress factors  <cit> . the absence of plg layer from the cell wall of mycobacteria grown in high nitrogen condition indirectly suggest that plg layer may be a form of nitrogen assimilation in pathogenic mycobacteria. in macrophages, mycobacteria encounter nitrogen stress which leads to high gs expression and plg layer synthesis in the cell wall. immunogold localization and plg isolation studies further validated the finding of no detectable plg in the cell wall of m. bovis, msfp, msp <dig> and msp <dig> strains when grown in high nitrogen conditions.

the ability of the pathogenic mycobacteria to form biofilm adds on to their virulence potential  <cit> . biofilm formed at air liquid interface are popularly known as pellicle. additionally, mycolic acids are the major component of the biofilms formed by mycobacterial species  <cit>  but it is not clearly known whether mycolic acid synthesis or its amount in cell wall is affected by plg layer. however, there are few reports that suggest the involvement of plg layer in biofilm formation  <cit> . a ∆glna <dig> strain of m. bovis that lack plg layer in the cell wall was found to be defective in biofilm formation  <cit> . additionally, our results showed that the biofilm and pellicle forming capability of m. smegmatis strain complemented with m. bovis glna <dig> was enhanced than the wild type. this is due to the fact that higher expression of m. bovis glna <dig> leads to the synthesis of plg layer in the m. smegmatis complemented with m. bovis glna <dig> <cit> . there are reports also suggesting that microbial amyloids play a significant role in biofilms of actinobacteria  <cit> . additionally, it was observed that biofilm was formed significantly much better in low nitrogen conditions which added to the involvement of plg layer in biofilm formation.

there is a gap in our understanding of the exact mechanisms and enzymes involved in the synthesis of plg layer till date. in addition to it, characterization of plg layer, can further help in our understanding of complex mycobacterial cell wall. because of high molecular weight and inert nature of the polymer it may also act as an adjuvant. this needs further investigation. establishment of the pathways involved in plg synthesis will further help in identification of new drug targets against tuberculosis. the study of nitrogen metabolism can provide an insight in the survival of these pathogens in adverse conditions for long duration of time. also this can help us to understand the mechanisms by which bacteria are able to survive and replicate in macrophages.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study we have investigated the expression of glna <dig> gene of m. bovis in response to nitrogen availability. this study revealed for the first time that amount of plg in the cell wall of m. bovis is substantially reduced when grown in high nitrogen conditions. the data presented here significantly enhance our understanding of the regulation of the glna <dig> gene which is linked to synthesis of the plg layer in the cell wall of m. bovis in altering nitrogen conditions. the localization study of plg layer in the cell wall, as shown by immunogold studies has also been reported for the first time.
