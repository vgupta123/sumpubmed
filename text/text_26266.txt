BACKGROUND
organization of chromatin and the nuclear envelope in animals and plants
genomic dna is packaged by proteins into chromatin that resides within the nuclear space in eukaryotic organisms. within this three-dimensional space, interphase chromosomes are often observed to occupy discrete, nonoverlapping territories  <cit> . the architecture of the cell nucleus as a whole, in combination with chromatin dynamics, provides a basis for cells' regulation of their gene expression, dna replication, and dna repair  <cit> . the eukaryotic cell nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane, the nuclear envelope , which is composed of the inner and outer nuclear membranes, separated by an ~30-nm perinuclear space. the two are connected through nuclear pore complexes, and the space between them is continuous with the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum . intrinsic membrane proteins associated with the inner and outer membranes make the ne a rather dynamic membrane system with a multitude of essential functions, including nuclear migration and positioning, cell cycle-dependent ne breakdown and reformation, cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling, calcium signaling, gene expression, genome stability, meiotic chromosome behavior, and karyogamy  <cit> . mutations in ne-associated proteins, such as nuclear lamins, give rise to a variety of heritable diseases in animals, collectively termed laminopathies, including muscular dystrophy, lipodystrophy, diabetes, dysplasia, leukodystrophy, and progeria  <cit> .

recent advances in yeast and animal ne research have identified sun  domain homology proteins as key residents of the ne, and their presence in plants is just beginning to be recognized and characterized  <cit> . despite the conservation of ne-mediated functions between plants and animals and the importance of the ne in plant biology, knowledge of the plant ne proteome remains limited  <cit> .

sun-domain proteins are highly conserved
sun-domain proteins have gained attention as a family of widely conserved ne-associated proteins that can transmit forces between the nucleus and cytoplasmic motility systems. sun-domain proteins were first characterized in schizosaccharomyces pombe and caenorhabditis elegans as ne-associated proteins associated with spindle pole-body and nuclear-migration defects, respectively  <cit> . since then, their analysis in other eukaryotes has extended their functions to roles in chromosome tethering, telomere maintenance, meiotic chromosome behavior, nuclear pore distribution, mitotic chromosome decondensation, and the regulation of apoptosis  <cit> . furthermore, genetic analysis revealed that knockouts within the mouse sun <dig> gene disrupted the expression of pirnas and caused a misregulation of a large number of meiosis-specific reproductive genes  <cit> .

in animals and fungi, sun proteins interact through their c-terminal sun domains in the perinuclear space with outer-nuclear-membrane-associated kash  proteins as part of the linc  complex  <cit> . the other members of the kash-domain family are proteins with cytoplasmic domains and nuclear lamins that reside in the nucleoplasm and therefore allow forces produced within the cytoplasm to be transmitted to the nuclear periphery. evidence for the expression and ne localization of plant sun-domain proteins has emerged from studies looking at cytokinesis in arabidopsis and nuclear proteomics in rice  <cit> . additional studies with atsun <dig> and atsun <dig> firmly establish that these proteins reside in the ne like their animal and fungal counterparts  <cit> .

sun-domain proteins and meiotic chromosome behavior
some animal and fungal sun-domain proteins are known to have a conserved role in meiotic chromosome behavior  <cit> . during meiotic prophase i, a dramatic reorganization of the nucleus occurs in which the chromosomes compact and telomeres attach themselves to the ne by an unknown active mechanism, cluster into a bouquet arrangement, and finally disperse along the surface of the inner nuclear membrane. the formation and dynamics of the bouquet configuration of meiotic chromosomes contribute to proper homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, recombination, and segregation  <cit> .

in maize, meiotic telomere clustering has been demonstrated to occur de novo on the ne during meiotic prophase i, and the temporal patterns are nearly identical to those in mammals  <cit> . interestingly, genetic disruption of the sun <dig> gene in mouse leads to defects in meiotic telomere-ne association, pairing, synapsis, and recombination, a phenotype remarkably similar to those of two maize synapsis-deficient mutants, desynaptic  and desynaptic <dig>   <cit> .

we set out to identify maize sun genes to provide a foundation for analysis of meiosis and other nuclear processes in plants. using bioinformatics and molecular approaches, we discovered five different sun-domain genes  in the maize genome. we present evidence that these fall into two subfamilies, which we call canonical c-terminal sun domain  and plant-prevalent mid-sun  <dig> transmembrane . we also provide the first evidence for expression and localization of pm3-type proteins and discuss the possible significance of this novel structural-variant subfamily.

RESULTS
identification of maize genes encoding canonical c-terminal sun-domain  proteins
a reference genome sequence was recently produced for the inbred line b <dig> . the sun genes described here refer to b <dig> sequences where possible, although many of the public cdna and est sequences in genbank are from multiple other inbred lines of maize. we identified sun-domain protein genes in a model plant genetic system by using a blast homology search of the maize genome queried with a fungal sun-domain protein sad1p, from s. pombe  <cit> . the two different putative maize sun-domain protein genes we initially identified, zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig>  were each predicted to encode ~ 50-kda proteins. when the predicted protein sequences were used to query the conserved domain database , each revealed the presence of a single conserved domain, the sun/sad1_unc superfamily , near the c-terminus of the proteins. these maize genes are homologous to recently characterized plant sun-domain protein genes from arabidopsis  and rice . experimental evidence from heterologous expression assays with fluorescent protein fusions indicates that these arabidopsis and rice ccsd proteins are localized at the ne. the presence of a c-terminal sun domain and the ne localization are among the defining features of animal and fungal sun proteins  <cit> . plant genomes therefore appear to encode canonical c-terminal sun-domain  type proteins, an observation that is not surprising given the conserved role of these proteins in basic eukaryotic processes such as meiosis, mitosis, and nuclear positioning  <cit> .

discovery of maize genes encoding pm3-type of sun-domain proteins
additional bioinformatic analyses revealed that the maize genome encodes not only ccsd-type sun-domain proteins but also a unique family of sun-domain protein genes not previously described. members of this second group of genes  encode slightly larger proteins with three transmembrane domains, a single sun-domain that is not at the c-terminus but rather in the middle of the protein, and a highly-conserved domain of unknown function that we refer to as the pm3-associated domain . when used to query the conserved domain database, these predicted proteins also revealed the presence of the sun/sad1_unc superfamily, pfam <dig>  homologous protein sequences with similar secondary structure and motif arrangement were found to be prevalent within plant genomes. we refer to this group, therefore, as the pm3-type  sun-domain proteins, as represented by the founding members zmsun <dig>  zmsun <dig>  and zmsun <dig>  a summary of the five maize sun-domain protein genes is provided in table  <dig> and the properties and motifs of the ccsd and pm <dig> subfamilies of these proteins are summarized in table  <dig>

conservation of two classes of sun-domain proteins in plants
we next carried out a phylogenetic analysis of ccsd and pm3-type sun-domain protein sequences from maize, sorghum, rice, arabidopsis, and moss . protein sequence alignments were used to produce an unrooted phylogenetic tree, shown in figure  <dig>  from the unrooted phylogenetic tree, we observed two different types of groupings. the first, a clear separation of the ccsd  and pm <dig>  subfamilies, suggests an ancient divergence of these two classes. these data also suggest that the pm <dig> proteins originated early in the life of the plant kingdom, predating the origin of flowering plants. the second, four orthologous groups observed within the grass species , may reflect functional divergence within each subfamily. if so, these soggs would be predicted to share expression patterns or genetic functions. interestingly, the two plants outside the grass family, arabidopsis and the nonflowering tracheophyte p. patens, also have genes predicted to encode at least two ccsd and at least two pm <dig> proteins, but their relationship to the soggs is not resolved by this phylogenetic analysis. plant genomes therefore appear to encode two different multigene subfamilies of sun-domain proteins, the ccsd and pm <dig> types.

shared gene structures reflect an early divergence of the two types of maize sun-domain proteins
the  <dig> -gb maize genome is partitioned among  <dig> structurally diverse chromosomes, which are predicted to encode over  <dig>  genes  <cit> . the genetic map of maize is subdivided into approximately  <dig> 10-to 15-cm bins  <cit> . the genome is complex and dynamic because of extensive and recent large segmental duplications  <cit>  and a major expansion of long terminal repeat sequences over the last few million years. current breeding lines and natural accessions of maize harbor large amounts of sequence diversity and many structural polymorphisms  <cit> .

using full-length cdnas  together with the b <dig> reference genome, we were able to define the structures of five maize sun-domain genes as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  three of these genes  are distributed as unlinked loci that map to two different chromosomes; zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> reside in adjacent genetic bins. in determining whether the ccsd or pm <dig> genes were located in any of the known blocks of genome duplication, we found that the high degree of sequence similarity between the sogg <dig> genes zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> suggests they arose as part of a gene-duplication event that is known to have resulted in many closely related gene pairs in maize  <cit> . indeed these two genes reside within a large syntenic duplicated block on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . this observation is consistent with the phylogenetic results that revealed the presence of four orthologous sun-domain protein groups, sogg <dig> , sogg <dig> , sogg <dig> , and sogg <dig> . surprisingly, we have not observed duplicate genes for zmsun <dig>  zmsun <dig>  or zmsun <dig>  so these may exist as single copies in the b <dig> maize genome.

an analysis of intron and exon structures within the maize sun genes showed that the gene structures are conserved within each class. the ccsd genes had two or three exons, and the sun domain was split between the exons. on the other hand, the pm <dig> genes had 4- <dig> exons and a sun domain that was encoded within the largest exon. comparative analysis of the maize zmsun gene structures revealed that the ccsd genes shared an ancestral intron that interrupts the sun domain . this ancestral intron position may be a hallmark of this class of sun genes, as it is also found in the arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, and moss homologs. zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> share a large intron, greater than  <dig> kb in size, whereas the pm <dig> genes all possess small introns ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in size.

properties of maize sun-domain proteins
using the full-length cdnas listed in table  <dig> we predicted the encoded proteins for five different maize sun-domain proteins. their features and primary motifs are summarized in table  <dig> and diagrammed in figure  <dig>  a multiple sequence alignment of ccsd-type proteins reveals divergence at the n-terminal region and conservation at the c-terminal region which encompasses the sun domain . several previously characterized fungal and animal sun-domain protein structures  are also shown for comparison. the sun-domain proteins of human, mouse, worm, and fission yeast differ in size and number of transmembrane and coiled-coil motifs, but all a have single c-terminal sun domain, considered a diagnostic feature for this family of ne-associated proteins. the plant proteins that most closely resemble the founding members of the sun-domain protein family are those encoded by the ccsd genes. the plant ccsd proteins exhibit conserved size and overall structure to a remarkable degree, having one transmembrane domain followed by one coiled-coil domain, and share an overall size of about  <dig> kda . relatively little is known about the ccsd proteins in plants. fluorescent protein fusion assays with atsun <dig>  atsun <dig>  and ossad <dig> demonstrate localization to the ne  <cit> . in addition, the ccsd proteins probably share some functions with their animal counterparts but have not been proven to do so.

even less is known about the pm <dig> proteins, and their functions are completely uncharacterized. they are significantly larger than plant ccsd proteins . their shared structural features are an n-terminal transmembrane domain, an internal sun domain, a pad, one or more predicted coiled-coil motifs, and two closely spaced c-terminal transmembrane domains . this collection of features defines them structurally, but the central location of the sun domain is not unique to plants. other, nonplant mid-sun-domain proteins, largely uncharacterized, from various species including fungi, flies, worms, and mammals can be identified by sequence-search analyses . whether or not these proteins reside or function in the ne remains to be determined.

in addition to their difference in size and sun domain locations, these protein subfamilies are distinct in other interesting ways . the ccsd-type proteins have a basic isoelectric point, whereas the pm3-type proteins have an acidic one . in addition, the pm <dig> proteins have a relatively large number of cysteine residues that may play important roles in intra- or intermolecular disulfide bridge formation. furthermore, a multiple sequence alignment reveals that the pm <dig> proteins all have the highly conserved region that we call the pad . this region of approximately  <dig> residues appears diagnostic for plant pm <dig> proteins and is spaced about 80- <dig> residues after the sun domain. the sun domain and the pad for  <dig> plant proteins revealed a high degree of amino acid conservation.

despite the similarity of domain architecture and sequence similarity within conserved domains, the remainder of the protein regions exhibit considerable sequence divergence between the sogg <dig> and sogg <dig> members in any given species. overall, these analyses show that the maize genome encodes at least two multigene families of sun-domain proteins. each of these two subfamilies comprises at least two genes. zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> are ccsd-type and are most closely related to plant sun-domain homologs atsun <dig>  atsun <dig>  and ossad <dig>  zmsun <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are pm3-type and probably represent a previously unknown class of sun-related proteins in plants.

mrna expression profiling of zmsun protein genes
the conservation of the sun-domain protein genes in plants suggests that they potentially have functions similar to those of their animal counterparts, for example nuclear positioning and motility within the cell, bridging the cytoplasm to the cortical layer of the nucleoplasm, and contributing to meiotic chromosome segregation through telomere tethering before synapsis and recombination  <cit> . maize sun domain genes that function in basic somatic cell processes such as mitosis, nuclear architecture, and chromosome tethering might be expected to show ubiquitous expression, whereas those that function in meiosis or pollen-nuclear migration or nuclear fusion at fertilization might show a more limited expression profile, being active in reproductive organs such as flowers, egg and pollen mother cells, and gametophytic tissues such as pollen grains. to begin to examine these possibilities, we looked at gene expression at the mrna abundance level using three different sources of information: ncbi's unigene; microarray expression data from anthers, which contain male meiotic cells; and solexa transcriptome profiling data derived from maize inbred line b <dig> tissues.

four of the five genes  are represented by consensus unigene models in ncbi , and three of these, zmsun <dig>  zmsun <dig>  and zmsun <dig>  are accompanied by quantitative est profile information expressed as transcripts per million, which we converted to transcripts per ten million . the est data were pooled according to tissue type, and only relatively deeply sequenced libraries  showed evidence of expression, as summarized in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  the ccsd genes, zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig>  appeared to be expressed at relatively low levels  in several tissues, including ear, endosperm, embryo, meristem, pollen, and tassel. only one pm3-type sun-domain gene, zmsun <dig>  currently has corresponding est profile data available from ncbi. it too shows relatively low expression levels  in a variety of tissues, such as embryo, pericarp, and shoot. these values are roughly 10% of those for unigene est data from two control so-called house-keeping genes, alpha tubulin  <dig>  and cytoplasmic gapdh , which are expressed in  <dig> of the  <dig> tissues at levels from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  tpdm.

given the role of sun-domain proteins in meitoic telomere behavior in a variety of nonplant eukaryotic species, we next examined microarray data from mrna expression profiles of male reproductive organs from 1- to 2-mm anthers. anthers in this size range are from tassels that had not yet emerged and and contain meiocytes before or during meiotic prophase. microarray probes  that showed 100% match with our b <dig> gene models were available for each gene, and their relative expression values are plotted in figure  <dig>  from these analyses, we observed that the relative expression levels of zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> were highest in meiosis-stage anthers, whereas zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> were the lowest there, and zmsun <dig> was intermediate in the overall range .

ascribing the meiotic telomere clustering functions to any one of the five sun genes may prove difficult, at least partly because the anther is made up of several different cell types that include not only cells in meiosis but also a layer of epidermal, intermediate, and tapetal cells. the expression or function of plant sun genes could be partitioned among these cell types, whereas these methods produced only a single value over the entire anther  <cit> . another consideration is that even single cells may contain multiple sun proteins with different, related, or even cooperative functions, such as ne rearrangements, interaction with nuclear pores, or paternal storage of gene products for postmeiotic functions such as pollen mitosis, pollen tube growth, nuclear migration, and fertilization.

solexa transcriptome expression profiling
expression levels for the two solexa-based sequencing-by-synthesis methods we used, solexa dual-tag-based  and solexa whole transcriptome  http://www.illumina.com/technology/sequencing_technology.ilmn), are also reported in transcripts per  <dig> million and derived from experiments on pooled samples of six major tissues of the b <dig> cultivar. both the solexa technology and the est unigene data provide discrete counts of sequenced molecules, but the solexa data are based on millions, not thousands, of reads per experiment, providing better representation of genes such as the zmsun genes that were expressed at low levels in each organ. the two platforms gave similar results for pooled tissue samples, as summarized in figure  <dig> and tabulated in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  most of the sun genes were expressed at low levels across multiple tissues; expression was similar within tissue types, regardless of developmental stage. the zmsun gene expression levels were about 2% of those of the moderately expressed housekeeping control gene, cytoplasmic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase .

to show more clearly the variation in expression levels among the sun genes, we replotted the same data as semi-log <dig> . the overall expression pattern is consistent with basic functions for sun-domain proteins in most cell types. a notable exception to the widespread pattern of expression was that of zmsun <dig>  which showed a very distinct and much more restricted pollen-related pattern of expression . such an expression profile predicts that zmsun <dig> should be required for specialized processes such as nuclear migration down the pollen tube and possibly double fertilization. an interesting and related observation is that fertilization involves nuclear fusion, as does karyogamy, which in yeast involves active nuclear migration and sun-domain proteins  <cit> .

the present report represents the first description of relative mrna expression levels of all members of a sun gene family in any plant species and may therefore prove useful to investigators of the functions of plant sun-domain proteins. despite some variation in the data across different expression platforms, as summarized above, a consistent trend for most of the zmsun genes is that they are expressed in many different tissues at relatively low levels, a finding similar to that of graumann et al.  <cit>  for the ccsd-type atsun <dig> gene. in addition, we observed a distinct exception to this overall pattern with zmsun <dig>  whose expression appears to be highly specific to pollen. given the lack of information on pm3-type sun proteins, we set out to characterize this group further in plants. we chose to examine a pm3-type gene that was expressed in many cell types including those expressed in meiosis-stage anthers with possible roles in meiotic telomere functions.

isolation and characterization of a maize pm3-type sun-domain protein gene from a meiotic cdna library
the role of sun genes in telomere-associated recombination and crossover control has been established for animals and yeast and is likely to exist in plants as well  <cit> . in this regard, we find intriguing that two different laboratories  <cit>  recently and independently mapped a recombination control qtl in maize to bin  <dig> , where zmsun <dig> resides. we screened a meiosis-enriched cdna library for zmsun <dig> and its closely related duplicate zmsun <dig> using a 639-bp pcr product corresponding to a region of the sun domain of zmsun <dig> at a stringency of tm-15°c. the probe has a high degree of similarity to both zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> yet it is not similar enough to zmsun <dig> or either of the ccsd-type genes to detect them. from approximately  <dig>  plaques, we isolated two identical full-length cdna clones of zmsun <dig> with identical insert sequences. the detection of zmsun <dig> but not zmsun <dig> is consistent with the relative expression levels for zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> in meiosis-stage anthers .

the full-length cdna sequence for zmsun <dig>  and the deduced protein sequence and motifs are illustrated in figure 7a. the predicted protein sequence from the zmsun <dig> gene is also shown  and reveals that the b <dig> sun <dig> and w <dig> sun <dig> are 88% identical. this relatively high level of protein similarity reflects their divergence after a maize genome duplication event estimated to have occurred about 5- <dig> mya  <cit> . the extent which these proteins have evolved functionally remains unknown.

the w <dig> zmsun <dig> full-length cdna is  <dig>  bp in length and has a predicted open reading frame  of  <dig>  bp encoding a 639-residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of ~ <dig> kd and an acidic isoelectric point of  <dig>  this full-length zmsun <dig> cdna predicts a protein with all of the motifs and arrangents  that are typical of the entire class of pm <dig> proteins.

localization of a maize pm3-type protein
to test for the presence and localization of zmsun3/ <dig> proteins in planta, we developed peptide antibodies for western blotting and immunolocalization, and the results are summarized in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the peptides used and the corresponding zmsun3/ <dig> sequences are shown figure 8a. our survey of a variety of tissues for the presence of pm3-type proteins with antisera to zms3gsp1a  revealed only one band band of about  <dig> kda in all of the tissues surveyed, including leaf, root, silk, husk, earshoot, embryo, preemergence  tassels, and emerged  tassels. this broad detection is consistent with the mrna expression profiles for zmsun <dig> and zmsun <dig> .

our examination of proteins from isolated male flowers at meiotic stages of development detected high-molecular-weight bands that were considerably larger than the predicted protein sizes. given the number of cysteine residues and the possibility of disulfide bridges, we examined the effect of prolonged boiling times in the presence of reducing agents  on the detectable band patterns. these high-molecular-weight bands were not detected in the protein samples examined for multiple other, different, nonanther tissues . the basis for this difference is not known, but it may result from more highly cross-linked sun3/ <dig> protein in the extracts from anthers than in those from the other tissues. after  <dig> or more minutes of boiling, the antibodies detected a single band of about  <dig> kda , similar to those detected in the multitissue survey blot . therefore, zmsun <dig>  zmsun <dig>  or both appear to be present in meiosis-stage anthers.

our examination of formaldehyde-fixed cells, shown in figure  <dig> revealed the strongest staining around the nuclear periphery but also detected considerable speckled cytoplasmic staining in a postmeiotic uninucleate pollen mother cell. the cytoplasmic staining may reflect nonspecific background or true signal from er-localized pm3-type sun-domain protein. interestingly, we have yet to detect staining in meiotic prophase nuclei with these antibodies, possibly because of difficulty in the preservation conditions or in detecting the epitope in prophase nuclei or possibly because of an absence of pm3-type sun-domain proteins in meiotic cells. the results of negative control experiments, using preimmune sera and secondary antibody only, are shown in figure  <dig> at image scaling comparable to that used for the anti-pm3-antibody staining . the lack of staining in the controls suggests that the staining patterns noted with the anti-pm <dig> sera were specific.

these data provide the first direct evidence of a pm <dig> sun-domain protein localized to the nuclear periphery and suggest that this sun domain in this subfamily of plant proteins can reside in the ne like the ccsd proteins. together, these observations suggest that plant nuclei contain multiple different sun-domain proteins.

models of the topology of plant sun-domain proteins
the two structural classes of plant sun-domain proteins found in maize, and shown to be occur commonly in many plant species, may have different functions. if they serve as physical connectors that transduce forces from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, determining their topologies and dispositions relative to the membranes of the ne will be an important step toward elucidating their biological roles. several models of different topoligical arrangements for generalized ccsd and pm <dig> sun proteins in the plant ne are presented in figure  <dig> 

if ccsd sun proteins adopt a configuration like that of plant, animal, or fungal sun proteins, the most likely arrangement would be that depicted by topology model "a" in figure  <dig>  in this configuration, the n-terminus would be in the nucleoplasm, possibly interacting with chromatin, inner-nuclear-membrane-associated proteins, or telomeres, and the sun domain would be positioned within the perinuclear space. connections to the cytoplasm would require interactions with other proteins embedded in the outer nuclear membrane. the configuration depicted in topology model "b" would suggest an opposite set of interactions. given the structure of the ne, the two models are not necessarily exclusive, as the two membranes are continuous and fused around nuclear pore complexes.

for the pm <dig> sun proteins, four different models  are presented for consideration because three transmembrane domains are involved. the c-terminal transmembrane domains are close together and unlikely, although not necessarily unable, to traverse the entire lumenal space. only models with the last two transmembrane domains in the same membrane are therefore presented. of these, topology models "d" and "e" are intriguing in that they predict a single protein bridge with both nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic segments. topology model "c" could have two different nucleoplasmic segments and thereby serve as a scafold for multiple nuclear molecules or complexes, including chromatin and nonchromatin nuclear proteins, other ne proteins, or telomeric dna. similarly, topology model "f" depicts a protein with two cytoplasmic segments that might be capable of interacting with two cytoplasmic partners, while requiring additional protein interaction to form a functional nucleoplasmic-cytoplasmic bridge.

in nonplant systems, sun proteins are linked to the cytoplasm by an interaction with kash-domain proteins that traverse the outer nuclear membrane. the kash domain proteins connect to various cytoskeletal components to function as cargo-specific cytoskeletal adaptor proteins  <cit> . as a family, the kash domain proteins have limited homology over a small portion of their entire protein sequence, and no plant kash-domain protein homologs have been identified by sequence analyses thus far. genetic or protein interaction screens may be required to identify sun-interacting partners and their function in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
the maize genome encodes a family of sun-domain protein genes that form two distinct classes; the ccsd-type, resembling canonical sun-domain proteins, and the pm3-type, representing a novel structural class shown here to be expressed in multiple tissues of maize and concentrated at the nuclear periphery in pollen mother cells. these two subfamilies are found in flowering plants and moss and therefore probably originated early in plant evolution, if not before that. the discovery of this gene family opens new avenues for investigation of molecular mechanisms that may link nuclear architecture to chromatin dynamics and nuclear positioning in maize. future genetic analyses will be important for defining the biological role of these plant sun genes in vivo.
