BACKGROUND
hepatitis b virus  infection is a serious health problem worldwide. the world health organization  has estimated that around  <dig> million people globally are chronically infected with hbv, which cause between  <dig>  and  <dig>  deaths annually  <cit> . in much of the developing world, , 8% to 10% of people in the general population become chronically infected. although hbv infection is less common in western europe, a recent investigation by the european centre for disease prevention and control showed an unexpected increase in hbv infection between  <dig> and  <dig> with an incidence from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> .

hbv belongs to the genus orthohepadnavirus of the hepadnaviridae family and has a circular genome of approximately  <dig>  kb in length. because of its long history of co-evolution with humans, hbv has evolved as multiple genetic strains that are present at different rates in human populations  <cit> . based on a minimum divergence of 8% of the complete genome sequences, hbv is classified as different genotypes consecutively identified as genotypes a–j  <cit> . the genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution. in europe, genotypes a and d are the main genotypes, and genotype a is more prevalent in northern and central europe  <cit> , whereas genotype d is mainly found in countries surrounding the mediterranean sea and in eastern europe  <cit> . genotype g was detected in hbv carriers from germany  <cit> , netherlands  <cit>  and georgia  <cit> . in france, all a-g genotypes were found, the most frequent being genotypes d  and a , followed by e  and c , and b   <cit> . hbv genotypes are used to trace the evolution and transmission of the virus. differences between genotypes affect the disease severity, disease course and likelihood of complications, as well as response to treatment and possibly to vaccination  <cit> .

besides genotypes, specific hbv viral mutations appear to strongly influence the outcome of hbv infection. hbv replicates through reverse transcription of an rna intermediate. because the reverse transcriptase activity of the hbv polymerase protein lacks a proofreading function, random mis-incorporation of bases into the replicating dna strand occurs, leading to a high mutation rate. in addition, mutations occur as a consequence of selection pressure by the host’s immune system and/or by exogenous factors such as active or passive vaccination or drug therapy  <cit> .

dna methylation is being increasingly recognized to play a role in the regulation of viral gene expression. it was demonstrated that hbv dna can be methylated in human tissue in both a nonintegrated form  <cit>  and following integration into the human genome  <cit> . dna methylation typically occurs in a cpg dinucleotide context that is often grouped in clusters called cpg islands. hypermethylation of cpg islands located in promoter regions are involved in gene silencing at the transcriptional level  <cit> . the hbv genome contains four promoter elements , and two enhancer elements  that control four defined overlapping open reading frames , which promote transcription and expression of the seven different hepatitis b proteins. many studies have demonstrated that hbv dna contains three predicted cpg islands termed conventional cpg islands i, ii and iii. recently, zhang et al. identified three novel cpg islands in  <dig> of  <dig> hbv isolates and named them cpg islands iv, v, and vi  <cit> . hou et al. also detected cpg islands at the same locations in  <dig> of  <dig> hbv isolates from chinese patients .

in the present study, the mutant sequence, as well as the location, distribution, length and genetic traits of cpg islands of different hbv genotypes isolated from the european patients were investigated to help us better understand the impact of mutation on gene expression among genotypes and the potential role of cpg islands in the epigenetic regulation of the hbv genome.

methods
nucleotide sequences of hbv genomes were searched from genbank using an updated database  at the national center for biotechnology information , using “hepatitis b virus”, “complete genome” and “genotype x”  as the terms for search query. full-length hbv genome sequences of genotypes a through g from european countries were retrieved. the background information consisted of an assessment of genome length, regions, genotype, resource, open reading frame  location and gene function. hbv genome sequences were manually excluded from the database when they were shorter than  <dig> base pairs , or had incomplete background information  <cit> .

multiple alignments of the  <dig> hbv sequences, containing complete functional genes or defined gene mutations, were conducted using the clustalx  <dig>  program . the genotype of each analyzed sequence was compared with the original report to confirm the background genotyping information. if a discrepancy existed between the observed data and the original report, updated information was collected for further analysis.

cpg islands were analyzed using methprimer  by examining the gc content and the observed-to-expected ratio in a window size. the location and size of cpg islands within each analyzed sequence were identified according to the current knowledge of cpg island distributions in the hbv genomes  <cit> . because each genotype contains multiple sequences and the lengths of the sequences are different, we calculated the length of cpg island of each genotype according to their location in the sequence: the most proximal site of the cpg island in the sequence was designated the start and the most distal site was designated the end. to identify each cpg island, the following criteria were defined: a gc content of  <dig>  or greater; an observed-to-expected cpg dinucleotide ratio of  <dig>  or greater; and both occurring within a sequence window of 100 bps or greater  <cit> .

discussion
geographical distribution of hbv genotypes in europe
of the  <dig> hbv isolates obtained from european patients, the most frequent was genotype d, followed by genotype a, in accordance with the previous reports on the geographical distribution of hbv genotypes in europe, especially the western part of europe  <cit> . genotype a was observed in  <dig> countries and genotype d in  <dig> countries. all other minor occurring genotypes including b, c, e, f and g, were found in  <dig> countries . of these countries, belgium had the greatest genotypic variation . the highest rates of hbv isolates in all genotypes , especially genotype a  were also found in belgium. this might be explained by recent immigration from far east asia and africa to europe  <cit>  and indicates belgium, as a western european country, has had an increased rate of hbv infections during the last decade  <cit> . for genotype d, the highest rate of hbv isolates was found in turkey, which might be because turkey has served as a bridge for many migration events during history  <cit> .

mutations among genotypes in europe
in the present study, the highest rates of mutant isolates occurred in genotypes d  and g . these mutations were associated with structural or functional abnormalities of the hbv genes. in genotype d, most significant functional abnormalities occurred in the pre-c/c region that include the truncated pre-c/c protein, the nonfunctional pre-c/c protein, or pre-c/c proteins containing an aa internal deletion. these abnormal changes might result from a point mutation occurring in the pre-c/c region or from pre-c/c genes becoming pseudogenes. it was shown that pre-c/c genes in some isolates of genotype d contained a point mutation at position  <dig>  that resulted in a premature stop codon  at the end of the precore region, preventing hepatitis b e antigen  synthesis  <cit> . lack of circulating hbeag, an immune tolerogen, might contribute to a more aggressive disease and cause liver damage with progression to cirrhosis and cancer or fulminant hepatitis  <cit> . this might explain why genotype d is associated with more severe liver diseases  <cit> . genotype g infection was often detected in the context of co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus  or recombination with genotype a  <cit> . it is characterized by stop codons at codon  <dig> and  <dig> of the pre-c region and insertion of  <dig> nucleotides at the 5' end of the c gene  <cit>  and by mutations preventing expression of hbeag  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> %  of genotype g isolates were from patients co-infected with hiv. the mutations occurred in the pre-c/c and x gene regions and led to the nonfunctional pre-c/c protein and the truncated x proteins, respectively. the frequent finding of genotype g in co-infected patients and its association with more advanced fibrosis suggests this genotype leads to rapid liver disease progression  <cit> .

comparison of cpg island length between normal and mutant isolates
some studies have reported that the lengths of cpg islands in mammalian genomes exhibit substantial variation. because promoters with long cpg islands have a larger number of rna polymerase ii binding sites compared to promoters with short cpg islands, it was proposed that variations in the length of cpg island promoters is tightly linked to patterns of downstream gene expression  <cit> . in the present study, the lds of cpg islands between the normal and mutant isolates were observed in genotypes a, d, e and g. although the functional abnormalities of hbv genes were detected in some of the mutant isolates with lds of islands, such abnormalities were also found in some mutant isolates without island lds. because all abnormalities were observed in the mutant isolates, such abnormalities should be caused by a mutation in isolates but not by the ld of the island. however, the biological and clinical significance of ld of islands warrants further study as islands located in the regulatory region are critical for transcription.

novel cpg islands in hbv genotypes a-g
the three novel cpg islands in the hbv genome were first described by zhang et al., and were thought to be potential targets for dna methylation  <cit> . we also found novel islands at the same locations in the hbv genome. in our study, novel island iv was present in genotypes a, d and e, island v was present in genotype f; and island vi was not present in a-g genotypes. in the report by zhang et al., island iv was detected in genotypes b, c and d, island v in genotypes b, f and h, and island vi in genotype c. the reason for differences between both studies might be that data was obtained from different sources. our data were from  <dig> isolates of european patients, and zhang's data was from  <dig> representative isolates of patients residing in  <dig> different countries worldwide. in our study, island iv was located between cpg islands i and ii and upstream of enh i, a region overlapping the s and p gene, island v was located between islands ii and iii, close to enh ii and the core promoters, a region overlapping the c genes. based on their position, their methylation status might be associated with the transcription of hbv genes. to date, there is no experimental data on the relationship between the methylation status of novel islands and expression of hbv genes, which requires further study.

distribution and genetic trait of cpg islands in hbv genotypes a-g
the various distributions of cpg islands in different genotypes were observed in this study. island i was observed in genotypes a, b, c, d and e, and islands ii and iii were detected in all a-g genotypes. these results were similar to a previous study  <cit> . the reason for some isolates only containing islands ii and iii might be the density of cpg dinucleotides within the first cpg-rich region in those sequences being low, leading to a loss of island i  <cit> . because hbv dna is methylated in human tissues either as a nonintegrated or integrated form  <cit>  and dna methylation is cpg site-specific  <cit> , the density and location of hbv cpg islands could have a direct impact on hbv gene expression in human tissue through their methylation.

we found “split” cpg islands in  <dig> of  <dig>  isolates of genotypes a, d, e, f and g. this “split” phenomenon was also detected in genotypes b and c isolated from chinese patients in our previous research . the occurrence mechanisms and the clinical significance of “split” cpg islands i or ii remain unclear. in this study we found that two mutant isolates of genotype d  and one mutant isolate from genotype e  lacked both islands i and iii . island ii is located in a regulatory region critical for the transcription of covalently closed circular dna , island i spans the start site of the s gene, and island iii covers the partial c gene and encompasses the start site of the p gene, therefore by investigating their methylation and mutation status, further insights into the mechanism of regulatory complexity of gene expression and clinicopathology might be obtained.

CONCLUSIONS
hbv genotypes a-g were identified in  <dig> isolates from european patients and the most frequent were genotypes d and a, followed by e, g, b, f and c. higher rates of mutant isolates were observed in genotypes d and g, and isolates lacking both cpg islands i and iii were observed in genotypes d and e. mutations in the genotypes might affect the regulation of hbv gene expression, leading to different clinical outcomes. the findings in this study will aid our understanding of the impact of mutation on hbv gene expression among genotypes and the potential role of cpg islands in the epigenetic regulation of the hbv genome. a limitation of the current work was the small number of isolates in some genotypes, especially genotypes b, c and f, which should be cumulatively increased to obtain more complete information.
