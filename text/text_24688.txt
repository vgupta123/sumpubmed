BACKGROUND
proteins are marked for degradation by the 26s proteasome via the covalent attachment of chains of the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin . this process involves three discreet steps. first, ubiquitin is activated by the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme  through the hydrolysis of atp to amp to yield a high energy thioester intermediate between the c-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and the catalytic cysteine of the e <dig> 

subsequently, ubiquitin is transferred onto the catalytic cysteine of one of many ubiquitin conjugating enzymes  which, in turn, transfer their cargo onto substrates with the help of ubiquitin ligase enzymes .

one of the best-studied e <dig> ubiquitin ligase enzymes is the four subunit complex scf . scf consists of two activities: the first, contained within the cul <dig> and ring domain hrt1/roc1/rbx <dig> proteins, is the ability to recruit and activate the e <dig> to facilitate ubiquitin transfer from the e <dig> onto substrate; the second resides within the variable f-box proteins, which are linked to cul <dig> via skp <dig> and are thought to recruit substrates for ubiquitination by the cul1/hrt <dig> sub-complex. the large number of different f-box proteins gives scf the opportunity to access a wide array of substrates. in yeast, over  <dig> f-box proteins are known, in a. thaliana over  <dig>  and in humans ~ <dig>  <cit> . the family of scf ligases in turn is the prototype for a superfamily of cullin-ring ligases that, like scf, are modular enzymes comprising a cullin-ring subcomplex linked to a variable substrate receptor subunit . altogether, the human genome may have the capacity to code for as many as  <dig> different crls.

given the diversity of crl substrate receptor proteins, two important questions emerge. first, how is the repertoire of crls dynamically controlled? second, are distinct crl complexes differentially regulated in a manner that depends on the identity of the substrate receptor? one partial answer to both of these questions is that f-box and other substrate receptors are often unstable proteins, and it is thought that they are targeted for degradation in part by 'autoubiquitination' within scf-e <dig> complexes  <cit> . however, not all crl substrate receptors are unstable, and thus there must be some means of differentially controlling their stability. there are multiple ways in which this might be accomplished. first, crl ubiquitin ligase activity is negatively regulated by cop <dig> signalosome  in vitro  <cit> . csn cleaves the ubiquitin-like protein nedd <dig> from the cullin subunit of crls  <cit> . attachment of nedd <dig> to cul <dig> strongly stimulates the ability of the cul1-hrt1/roc1/rbx <dig> catalytic core to promote ubiquitin chain synthesis by cdc <dig> e <dig> enzyme  <cit> . once nedd <dig> is detached, cand <dig> can bind cul <dig> and displace skp <dig>  thereby preventing the recruitment of substrate to the catalytic core  <cit> . in addition to removing nedd <dig>  csn also recruits a deubiquitinating enzyme to cul <dig>  ubp <dig>  that opposes ubiquitin polymerization  <cit> . thus, csn may play a key role in controlling the dynamics of individual crl complexes and the overall repertoire of different crl complexes in a cell.

csn is a highly conserved protein complex found from yeast to humans. csn is composed of eight subunits, termed csn1-csn <dig>  <cit>  and each of these subunits contains high homology to components of the 26s proteasome lid subcomplex and eukaryotic initiation factor  <dig>  . csn has been found to play diverse roles in several different organisms . in a. thaliana, csn components were identified in a screen for plants that displayed a constitutive photomorphogenic defect . in d. melanogaster, mutations in csn <dig> and csn <dig> result in pleitropic effects, including activation of meiotic checkpoints  <cit>  and failure of photoreceptor neurons to differentiate  <cit> . rnai of csn <dig> in c. elegans additionally results in pleitropic effects, including sterile worms and alterations in microtubules  <cit> .

although the molecular basis behind many of these phenotypes has yet to be elucidated, it is becoming evident that deneddylation of cullins catalyzed by the 'jamm' metalloprotease active site motif in the csn <dig> subunit is at least partially responsible. transgenic csn <dig> with mutations in the jamm motif fails to correct the developmental defects of csn5-delete flies  <cit> . moreover, failure to deneddylate cul <dig> in c. elegans is implicated in accumulation of the microtubule severing protein mei- <dig>  which results in microtubule defects  <cit> .

the effects of loss of deneddylation of cullin proteins are still not understood. loss of csn function causes a defect in cullin-based ligase activity in vivo suggesting that deneddylation promotes scf activity  <cit> . however, in vitro data suggests a negative role for csn in regulation of scf  <cit> . what may account for this discrepancy? one hypothesis suggests that neddylation and deneddylation affect cycles of assembly of crl complexes and the stability of substrate adaptor proteins in vivo  <cit> .

in an effort to investigate how loss of deneddylation affects scf activity, we conditionally silenced the catalytic subunit of csn in mammalian cells. suppression of csn <dig> protein resulted in a significant decrease in the f-box proteins skp <dig>  cyclin f, fbx <dig>  fbx <dig>  and fbw <dig>  moreover, mrna transcripts for all but one of these f-box proteins were unaltered when csn <dig> was suppressed, suggesting the decreases in protein levels are post-translational. consistent with this notion, treatment with proteasome inhibitors largely restored the levels of multiple f-box proteins and dominant-negative cul <dig> prevented loss of cyclin f. finally, we found a dramatic increase in the protein and activity levels of the scffbw <dig> substrate cyclin e, suggesting that loss of f-box proteins in csn-deficient cells results in substrate accumulation.

RESULTS
depletion of csn <dig> in hek <dig> cells is not lethal
to analyze the effect of loss of deneddylation in human cells, we utilized the doxycyline-inducible shrna system developed by clevers and colleagues  <cit>  to conditionally down-regulate csn <dig> protein levels. eight days of doxycycline treatment of cells carrying the inducible csn5-specific shrna resulted in a drastic reduction in both csn <dig> mrna and protein levels when compared to induced cells expressing a scrambled shrna . by contrast, the levels of other csn subunits showed little or no change . despite this significant drop in csn <dig> protein levels, few morphological changes were observed, the cells continued to grow and divide, and little change in steady-state cell cycle distribution was detected by facs . this is consistent with prior observations on normal diploid bj <dig> fibroblasts depleted of csn <dig>  <cit> . given that loss of csn function results in accumulation of the neddylated form of cullins in yeast, drosophila, and c. elegans, we analyzed the endogenous cullins 1– <dig> by western blot in human cells depleted of csn <dig>  loss of csn <dig> resulted in enhanced neddylation of all four cullins, although to varying extents . the failure to observe complete conversion of all cullins to the neddylated species – as was seen for cul <dig> in csn1Δ s. pombe cells  <cit>  – may be due to residual csn <dig> activity, an alternative cullin deneddylase, limiting nedd <dig> attachment activity, or the sequestration of deneddylated cullins into complexes with cand <dig>  <cit> . despite the change in nedd <dig> modification, the total levels of cullins 1– <dig> were largely unaltered in csn5-depeleted human cells, except for a modest reduction in the level of cul <dig> 

loss of deneddylation causes a reduction in f-box protein levels
it has been proposed that loss of deneddylation could render f-box adaptor proteins unstable  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the levels of several endogenous f-box proteins in cells depleted of csn <dig>  in this experiment and throughout this report, we focused our effort on endogenous proteins to avoid potential artifacts associated with overexpression of recombinant proteins. concomitant with loss of csn <dig>  we observed significant decreases in the steady-state protein levels of skp <dig>  cyclin f, fbw <dig>  fbx <dig> and fbx <dig> . to test whether this decrease in protein levels was post-transcriptional, we performed rt-pcr on the corresponding mrna transcripts. despite the significant drop in protein levels, there was little change in mrna levels, suggesting that for  <dig> of the  <dig> f-box proteins examined  the loss of protein was due to reduced translation or increased degradation . interestingly, two f-box proteins, β-trcp and emi <dig>  showed little or no change in protein level when csn <dig> was suppressed .

to determine if the decrease in f-box protein levels was specific and due to loss of jamm isopeptidase activity, we ectopically expressed mouse csn <dig> in cells depleted of endogenous csn <dig> by shrna. transfection of wild-type mouse csn <dig> cdna, which differs by two nucleotides from human csn <dig> in the region that is targeted by the silencing shrna, restored wild-type levels of both skp <dig> and cyclin f . in contrast, expression of two different jamm point mutants of mouse csn <dig> failed to restore skp <dig> and cyclin f protein levels, despite normal levels of expression of the mutant proteins . the protein levels of fbx <dig> could not be rescued by overexpression of wild-type mouse csn <dig>  suggesting that loss of fbx <dig> arose from a promiscuous effect of the csn5-directed sirna and was not due to csn <dig> knockdown , therefore, the reduction in skp <dig> and cyclin f levels in csn5-depleted cells is caused by the loss of csn isopeptidase activity.

loss of f-box proteins is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome system
we next examined whether the 26s proteasome was involved in the reduction of f-box protein levels. treatment of csn5-depleted cells with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig> largely restored normal levels of fbx <dig>  cyclin f, and fbw <dig>  whereas skp <dig> levels were only partially rescued . by contrast, the loss of fbx <dig> was not reversed by proteasome inhibition, which is consistent with our prior observation that csn <dig> shrna non-specifically diminished the levels of fbx <dig> transcripts. similar results were obtained for all proteins when we used the proteasome inhibitor llnl. therefore, the loss of f-box proteins in csn5-depleted cells appears to depend largely upon the 26s proteasome.

the role of the proteasome in mediating the loss of f-box proteins in csn5-depleted cells suggested that csn <dig> might normally protect f-box proteins within scf complexes from being 'autoubiquitinated' by the associated e <dig> enzyme and then degraded. to address this possibility we sought to examine the levels of a representative f-box protein in cells in which csn <dig> was depleted and scf activity was simultaneously inhibited. a c-terminal truncation mutant of cul <dig>  possesses dominant-negative activity  <cit> . to determine if the loss of cyclin f in csn5-depleted cells was scf dependent, we transiently expressed either wild-type or cul <dig>  in doxycycline-induced cells. whereas expression of full length cul <dig> did not alter cyclin f accumulation, expression of cul <dig>  restored cyclin f to levels comparable to those seen in untreated cells . these data indicate that loss of cyclin f was dependent upon an intact scf complex.

loss of fbw <dig> results in a marked increase in substrate levels
given the reduction in fbw <dig> levels in csn5-depleted cells, we analyzed two substrates of scffbw <dig> – cyclin e and c-myc – to see if they were stabilized. down-regulation of csn <dig> resulted in accumulation of both c-myc and cyclin e  as well as cyclin e-associated histone h <dig> kinase activity . moreover, depletion of csn <dig> resulted in a loss of cell cycle regulation of cyclin e protein abundance , which is consistent with a defect in cyclin e turnover.

overexpression of a non-degradable form of cyclin e results in chromosome instability  <cit> . to examine chromosome stability in csn5-depleted cells, we induced cells for  <dig> days with doxycycline and examined them for chromosome abnormalities by fish and karyotyping. despite a significant increase in cyclin e, we could not detect any chromosomal abnormalities .

discussion
csn downregulates the activity of scf ubiquitin ligase in biochemical reconstitution assays  <cit>  whereas loss of csn components in several different organisms causes a defect in scf activity in vivo  <cit> . to understand the basis for these paradoxical observations, we investigated the nature of scf complexes in cells deprived of csn activity. here, we report that suppression of csn <dig> in human cells resulted in a decrease in steady-state f-box protein levels. this decrease was post-transcriptional, stemmed from loss of the metallopeptidase activity of csn <dig>  and was largely proteasome-dependent. for cyclin f, the reduction in levels was blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of cul <dig>  as a consequence of the decline in f-box protein levels, ligands that are targeted for degradation by these f-box proteins are expected to accumulate. indeed, both cyclin e and c-myc, substrates of scffbw <dig>  accumulated in csn5-depleted cells. although our study focused on f-box substrate receptor subunits of scf, we anticipate that depletion of csn <dig> will have similar consequences for vhl box, btb domain, and socs box proteins that deliver substrates to cul <dig>  cul <dig>  and cul <dig>  respectively.

loss of csn <dig> causes both loss of deneddylation activity and loss of crl-associated deubiquitination activity mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme ubp <dig>  <cit> . ubiquitination and turnover of crl substrate receptor proteins is suppressed by ubp <dig>  <cit> , and thus it is possible that the loss of f-box proteins that we observed in csn5-depleted cells was due to loss of either deneddylation by csn <dig> and/or f-box protein deubiquitination by ubp <dig>  however, expression of csn <dig> carrying point mutations in the jamm motif did not restore cyclin f or skp <dig> protein levels in cells depleted of endogenous csn <dig> , even though human csn complexes bearing a mutated jamm domain possess associated deubiquitinating activity equivalent to that of wild type csn  <cit> . thus, we propose that loss of csn-dependent deneddylation is sufficient to bring about a reduction of steady-state f-box protein levels in human cells.

the exact mechanism by which the substrate adaptors are turned over in csn5-depleted cells is unknown. however, the stimulatory effect of neddylation on scf activity in vitro  <cit>  and the restoration of cyclin f levels by dominant-negative cul <dig> in csn5-depleted cells suggests an autocatalytic mechanism wherein an f-box protein is ubiquitinated by the neddylated cul1-hrt <dig> catalytic module present in the same scf complex. we propose that once an scf ubiquitin ligase exhausts its pool of available substrate, deneddylation of the cul <dig> subunit by csn brings about disassembly of the complex, with the end result being that the skp1-f-box heterodimer is released and cul1-hrt <dig> are sequestered into an inactive assemblage with cand <dig>  in csn5-depleted cells, the inactivation process is not initiated and therefore the f-box protein remains constitutively associated with a highly active, neddylated cullin-ring catalytic core, resulting in a high rate of f-box protein ubiquitination and degradation.

interestingly, whereas most f-box proteins that we examined  exhibited a significant decline in levels upon depletion of csn <dig>  others  were not affected . we do not understand the basis for this difference, but it is unlikely to reflect whether a given f-box protein is turned over in normal cells, because β-trcp levels were not reduced in csn5-depleted cells even though transfected β-trcp is turned over with a reasonably brisk half-life of ~ <dig> minutes  <cit> . clearly, more work is needed to determine why accumulation of only some f-box proteins depends upon csn.

given the substantial reduction in the steady-state levels of multiple f-box proteins upon depletion of csn <dig>  it is surprising that depleted cells continued to proliferate with normal cell cycle kinetics and did not exhibit a dramatic phenotype. for example, overexpression of cyclin e  <cit>  or deletion of fbw <dig>  <cit>  causes chromosomal instability, but we were unable to detect any measurable defect in chromosome status in csn5-depleted cells . given that depletion of csn <dig> can affect so many different f-box proteins and presumably socs/bc box and btb domain proteins as well, it is possible that opposing pathways were perturbed in such a way as to prevent the onset of chromosome instability. a similarly mild growth effect of depleting csn <dig> was seen in a previous study of the normal diploid human fiboroblast bj <dig> cell line  <cit> . as we have noted previously, the function of csn <dig> may be more critical in a multicellular context, or in the face of differentiation signals that evoke a major change in the repertoire of cellular proteins  <cit> .

while this manuscript was in preparation, it was reported that loss of function mutations in csn components in s. pombe and neurospora renders the substrate-recruiting subunits of both cul <dig> and cul3-based crl complexes unstable, resulting in accumulation of their respective targets  <cit> . in addition, deneddylation of cullins mediated by csn is required for the maintenance of cullin protein levels in drosophila and for cul <dig> stability in neurospora  <cit> . in our original studies in s. pombe  <cit> , we observed normal levels of cul <dig> in a csn1Δ mutant, and this result has been confirmed and extended to other cullins in s. pombe  <cit>  as well as arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the results reported here indicate that accumulation of human cullins does not depend on csn-dependent deneddylation. it is unclear why human, fission yeast, and arabidopsis cullins behave differently from those of drosophila and neurospora.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that csn can stabilize f-box proteins, thus acting positively on scf. csn has been shown to participate in several different processes, including development, transcription, and cell cycle progression . we propose that loss of deneddylation and a consequent decline in f-box protein abundance underlies these phenotypes.
