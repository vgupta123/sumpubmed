BACKGROUND
cd <dig> is a 50â€“ <dig> kda transmembrane glycoprotein. the molecule has an external domain consisting of two regions exhibiting the features of the immunoglobulin superfamily  <cit> . cd <dig> is widely expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells and tissues  <cit> . however, the molecule is strongly expressed on various cancer cells, thymocytes and activated t lymphocytes  <cit> . cd <dig> is involved in cellular adhesion  <cit> , lymphocyte activation  <cit> , membrane transport  <cit>  and signal transduction  <cit> . in addition, cd <dig> plays a crucial role in the invasive and metastatic activity of tumor cells  <cit> . inhibition of cd <dig> cell surface expression may help to elucidate these physiological functions of cd <dig> 

a negative regulatory function for cd <dig> in t cell regulation has been demonstrated  <cit> . recently, two anti-cd <dig> mabs, m6-1e <dig> and m6-1b <dig>  which react with the membrane-distal ig domain, have been shown to inhibit okt3-induced t cell proliferation  <cit> . presumably, prevention of cell division is caused by delivery of a negative signal via cd <dig>  another possibility is prevention of cd <dig> becoming associated with its cell surface partners, which may cooperate in cd <dig> signaling to generate the complete activation signal. the latter hypothesis may be investigated by blocking the expression of surface cd <dig> 

intracellularly expressed antibodies  can inhibit protein function in specific cellular compartments  <cit> . they have the capacity to inhibit the translocation of cell surface molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum  to the cell surface as er-intrabodies  <cit> . intrabodies offer an effective alternative to gene-based knockout technology  <cit> . this technique has several advantages compared to rna interference  technology, since intrabodies possess a much longer active half-life than rna, are much more specific to their target molecules  <cit>  and generally do not disrupt target gene transcription. moreover, gene knockout and silencing techniques cannot be used to analyze domain functions and post-translationally modified protein functions.

the aim of the present study was to generate an intrabody against cd <dig> in order to down-regulate the cell surface expression of cd <dig> and retain this surface molecule inside the cell. sequences encoding both variable regions of heavy chain  and light chain  domains against cd <dig> were cloned from hybridomas producing monoclonal antibody clone m6-1b <dig>  these sequences were joined by a flexible peptide linker sequence, allowing the expression of scfv as a single polypeptide chain. the functional activities of this intrabody, i.e. target tracing and capturing, were verified in a human embryonic kidney cell line, 293a, which naturally expresses cd <dig>  this manipulation of cell surface cd <dig> expression could serve as a basis for the generation of cd147-down regulated cells, and represents a step toward characterizing the role of cd <dig> in regulation of lymphocyte activation and induction of matrix metalloproteinase production by tumor cells.

RESULTS
construction of a phagemid vector encoding scfv-m6-1b9
the heavy, fd, and light chain domains of anti-cd <dig> mab, m6-1b <dig>  <cit> , were amplified, subcloned into the expression vector and then named as pcom3h-fab-m6-1b <dig>  subsequently, the vl and vh were amplified from pcom3h-fab-m6-1b <dig> and attached by a peptide linker to form the scfv. the amplified product was cloned into phagemid vector pcomb3x, named pcomb3x-scfv-m6-1b <dig>  and then transformed into e. coli tg <dig>  the nucleotide sequence of the inserted fragment, scfv, was obtained . the scfv construct was fused to the carboxy-terminal domain of the minor coat protein, gpiii, and displayed on the surface of phage particles. the deduced amino acid sequences of variable heavy  and light  chains are listed in figure  <dig>  the amino acid residues responsible for paratope in cdr regions were subsequently identified via the wam  algorithm  <cit> . the sequence can be numbered following kabat's rule  <cit> , in order to assure success in cloning the immunoglobulin variable domains.

detection of phage-displayed scfv-m6-1b9
the expression of fab- and scfv-m6-1b <dig> on phage particles was assessed by western immunoblotting. equal amounts of each recombinant phage were fractionated by sds-page, blotted, and probed with anti-gpiii mab. wild-type gpiii has a calculated molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda. however, a  <dig> kda protein detected in western blots using anti-gpiii specific antibodies has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . the truncated form of gpiii is used in pcomb <dig> vector which has a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. in case of fab antibody fusion format in the present study, fd fragment was fused to truncated gpiii. this resulted in migration of fd-gpiii fusion at  <dig> kda as indicated by arrow . likewise, the molecular mass of scfv is also approximately  <dig>  kda which resulted in a molecular weight of  <dig> kda of scfv-gpiii fusion protein. thus, the immunoreactive bands of scfv-m6-1b9- and fab-m6-1b9-gpiii fusion protein with the approximate molecular weight of  <dig> kda were obtained . noticeably, the band corresponding to the scfv-gpiii fusion protein was more prominent than the band corresponding to the fab-m6-1b9-gpiii fusion protein, reflecting the fact that expression of scfv was superior to that of fab obtained by the phage display technique. antigen-specific binding of phage presenting the different antibody formats was verified by elisa using recombinant cd147-biotin carboxyl carrier protein  fusion protein as an antigen. the scfv format demonstrated more favorable antigen-binding features than the fab format . in contrast, vcsm <dig> phage prepared from non-transformed tg- <dig> did not generate the signal against cd147-bccp antigen. these results suggest that phage presenting different antibody formats of m6-1b <dig> had been successfully produced and that the scfv version was the better functional antibody fragment.

detection and characterization of soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> produced in e. coli
the pcomb3x-scfv-m6-1b <dig> was subsequently transformed into e. coli hb <dig> to produce the soluble scfv antibody. the presence of soluble scfv in the culture supernatant was detected by western immunoblotting regarding ha and his tags. the reactive bands revealed by anti-ha or anti-his were located at the same molecular weight  . this result indicates that soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> was successfully produced by e. coli hb <dig> 

the specificity of soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> was analyzed by elisa using cd147-bccp as antigen . various dilutions of soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> were represented the positive signal with cd147-bccp. no signal was detected in the control well of survivin-bccp  antigen. subsequently, western immunoblotting was used to confirm the specificity of the generated scfv-m6-1b <dig> against recombinant cd <dig>  a specific band of cd147-bccp at ~ <dig> kda was detected by probing with soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> . in addition, the native epitope of cd <dig> on the u <dig> cell surface was recognized by soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> using flow cytometric analysis. the mean fluorescence intensity  of cd <dig> cell surface expression on u <dig> cells stained with soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> was  <dig>  . this was similar to the value for the original antibody, m6-1b <dig>  which mfi was  <dig>  as shown in figure 3d. these results strongly suggested that the generated soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> carry a cd147-specific paratope which recognized both recombinant and native cd <dig> 

to further characterize the specificity of the produced scfv, the inhibiting activity of soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> with the original monoclonal antibody, m6-1b <dig>  was tested. the optical density of mixture of soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> and mab m6-1b <dig> was lower than soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> alone . in contrast, the irrelevant mab mt-svv <dig> did not show the inhibition effect. this indicates that the scfv-m6-1b <dig> recognized the same antigenic determinant as its original mab m6-1b <dig> 

intracellular expression of scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody abated cell surface expression of cd <dig> on 293a cells
the compatibility of scfv-m6-1b <dig> with a eukaryotic expression system was examined by transducing the recombinant adenovirus harboring scfv-m6-1b <dig> into 293a cells. alteration of surface expression of cd <dig> in transduced 293a cells was examined at  <dig> h after transduction. cd <dig> cell surface expression was decreased in scfv-m6-1b <dig> adenovirus-transduced 293a cells compared to untransduced cells . in contrast, no alteration of cd <dig> expression was observed on scfv-svv <dig> adenovirus-transduced cells . this result revealed that intracellular expression of scfv-m6-1b <dig> as intrabody could diminish cd <dig> expression on cell surface of intrabody-expressing 293a cells.

colocalization of scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody and cd <dig> in 293a cells
colocalization of scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody and cd <dig> within transfected 293a cells was elucidated. as shown in figure  <dig> and in the three-dimensional movies , scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody was found intracellularly and colocalized with cd <dig>  this result implied that scfv-m6-1b <dig> protein fused with er-retention signal was successfully expressed and retained the cd <dig> molecule inside the cell.

discussion
cd <dig> plays a crucial role in several tissues, but is particularly dense on the surface of activated t-lymphocytes  <cit>  and malignant tumor cells  <cit> . diminishing the expression of cd <dig> on the cell surface could serve as a step towards exploring the significance of cd <dig> in cellular functions. in the present study, we successfully employed an intrabody-based approach to reduce the expression of cd <dig> on the 293a cell surface. this opens new prospects for uncovering the functional role of cd <dig> 

critical residues implicated in antigen binding from a given antibody paratope are important for the construction of different antibody formats. the deduced amino acid residues responsible for paratope in cdr regions of the scfv-m6-1b <dig> were identified via the wam algorithm  <cit>  and can be numbered following kabat's rule  <cit> . these confirmed the precise cloning of the immunoglobulin variable domains of anti-cd <dig> mab, m6-1b <dig>  into the phagemid vector.

two antibody formats, fab and scfv, were exploited for antibody phage display. to assess whether fab-m6-1b <dig> or scfv-m6-1b <dig> on gpiii of phage particles have exclusive activities, both antibody formats were generated and evaluated. the expression of phage-displayed scfv-m6-1b <dig> was significantly greater than phage-displayed fab-m6-1b <dig>  and both antibody fragments could recognize the cd <dig> protein. noticeably, the scfv format exhibited a greater binding activity compared to the fab format. the expression level of scfvs in e. coli is typically higher than fabs and generates a more efficient antibody display on the phage particle. the interdomain disulfide bond at the c-terminal of the constant region, which plays an important role in fab stabilization, is predisposed to provide lower production yield than scfvs  <cit> .

recognition of the amber stop codon between the scfv and gpiii genes that occurs during the expression of pcomb3x-scfv-m6-1b <dig> in the non-suppressing hb <dig> e. coli strain resulted in the production of soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig>  <cit> . this antibody fragment was specifically targeted both recombinant cd <dig>  and native cd <dig>  expressed on u <dig> cell surface. in addition, we demonstrated the inhibition of soluble scfv-m6-1b <dig> by the original antibody, m6-1b <dig>  these data show that the soluble antibody fragment contained a properly folded, bioactive paratope which recognized both non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms of cd <dig>  cd <dig> is a highly glycosylated membrane protein. the variation in its molecular weight, ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, arises from different glycosylation patterns  <cit> . targeting of both glycosylated and non-glycosylated cd <dig> molecules via scfv-m6-1b <dig> will be useful as a tool to knockdown the molecules in various cell types.

generation of adenoviral recombinants carrying scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody in 293a cells was deemed successful, since the cell surface expression of cd <dig> on these transduced cells declined . it is an open question as to whether this is due to the disruption of cd <dig> production or the retention of cd <dig> within the cells. possibly the er retention signal, kdel, sequestered scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody in the er. this sequestration resulted in the binding of intrabody to the newly synthesized cd <dig> and retains this molecule inside the cells, as demonstrated by three-dimensional imaging. this result coincided with the functional knockdown of major histocompatibility complex i . anti-mhc-i intrabody containing this er retention signal could reduce the surface expression of mhc-i on human umbilical vein endothelial cells   <cit> . thus the kdel may be necessary for the single-chain antibody protein to diminish the expression of cell surface molecules. the remaining cd <dig> could be due to the incomplete knockdown effect resulting from transient expression of the scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody.

intrabodies demonstrate an alternative strategy of gene inactivation that targets genomic dna or mrna. unlike rnai technology, intrabodies act at the posttranslational level and can be directed to relevant subcellular compartments  <cit> . this technique has been employed to diminish expression of a variety cell surface molecules  <cit> . downregulation of the cd <dig> surface molecule on 293a cells by means of scfv intrabody expression was achieved in the present study. nevertheless, rnai technology has been successfully employed to restrain the expression of cd <dig> and study the function and mechanism of cd <dig> in the development of tumor cell lines  <cit> . we therefore aim to introduce the intrabody approach as an alternative method for studying the function and mechanism of cd <dig> in a variety of metastatic tumors in the near future.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence that intrabody technology can be used to diminish the expression of cd <dig> on 293a cells. assessment of the fundamental function of cd <dig> could be achieved in the near future.
