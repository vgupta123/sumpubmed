BACKGROUND
growth during the development of multicellular organisms requires an expansion in cell number, generally accompanied by cellular specialisation, and the formation of distinct tissues and organs. there is a wealth of information about the underlying cellular processes, including the regulation of cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, but the control of growth and proportions at the level of tissues, organs and body size remains poorly understood . the insulin-like growth factors , igf <dig> and igf <dig>  promote cell survival and proliferation, and mouse knockout studies show that they have a central role in controlling body size during development . an analogous insulin/igf growth-regulatory pathway has been demonstrated in a number of animals, including invertebrates such as drosophila  <cit> , and may exist in all animals. in mammals two genes encoding key components of the igf pathway, igf <dig> and igf2r, are subject to regulation by genomic imprinting  <cit> .

imprinted genes have been the focus of much attention because they defy one of the central assumptions of mendelian inheritance, that the two parental genomes can be regarded as equal. genes regulated by genomic imprinting are expressed exclusively, or predominantly, from one parental allele in at least some of the sites where they are active  <cit> . the pattern of allelic expression is a characteristic feature, with some imprinted genes expressed from the paternally-inherited allele, such as the genes encoding insulin-like growth factor  <dig>   <cit>  and delta-like  <dig>   <cit> , and others expressed from the maternally-inherited allele, such as those encoding the insulin-like growth factor type  <dig> receptor   <cit>  and the non-coding rna h <dig>  <cit> . the growth factor receptor bound protein  <dig> gene  exhibits expression from the maternal allele that is widespread in fetal tissues outside of the central nervous system , but also exhibits expression from the paternal allele within the cns  <cit> . opposite imprinting of a single gene that expresses the same products in different tissues is currently unique to grb <dig> 

several theories have been proposed for the evolution of imprinted genes, the most widely accepted being the parental conflict hypothesis, which was put forward before any of the imprinted genes were identified  <cit> . it holds that paternally expressed genes will function to promote offspring growth, at the expense of maternal resources, while maternally expressed genes will limit offspring growth to provide a more even distribution of resources amongst offspring throughout the mother’s reproductive lifespan. this works for species in which offspring have access to maternal resources during at least some of their early growth period, and in which females are likely to reproduce with more than one male. thus, the theory was proposed to apply to mammals and flowering plants, in which maternal resources are made available to growing offspring through the placenta and endosperm, respectively. the species distribution remains true, with imprinted genes identified in both mammals,  and angiosperms  <cit> .

paternally expressed igf <dig> and maternally expressed igf2r were two of the first imprinted genes to be identified  <cit> . mouse knockout studies revealed a role for igf <dig> in promoting fetal growth  <cit>  and for igf2r as an inhibitor of fetal growth  <cit> . this matched perfectly with the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis and was made more compelling by the discovery that the igf2r, also known as the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor , acts by targeting igf <dig> for lysosomal degradation  <cit> . indeed, the mammalian ci-mpr has a specific binding site for igf <dig> that is not present in non-mammalian vertebrates, consistent with the igf2r function having evolved together with genomic imprinting  <cit> . the oppositely imprinted igf <dig> and igf2r genes are therefore functionally antagonistic, acting within the same biochemical pathway to regulate growth.

over  <dig> imprinted genes have now been identified in placental mammals  <cit> , a significant proportion having growth regulatory roles consistent with the parental conflict hypothesis  <cit> . it should be noted that other imprinted genes have diverse functions, notably in energy homeostasis  <cit> , or brain function and behaviour  <cit> . some of these functions are difficult to reconcile with the conflict hypothesis, particularly those affecting only post-natal aspects of physiology or behaviour  <cit> , leading to the proposal of alternatives such as coadaptive evolution  <cit> , which are not necessarily mutually exclusive with the parental conflict hypothesis  <cit> . since the discovery of the relationship between igf <dig> and igf2r there have been no other clear examples of imprinted genes with antagonistic growth functions, although oppositely imprinted transcripts at the gnas locus have antagonistic roles in behaviour and physiology  <cit> . there are also examples of changes in one imprinted gene affecting the expression of others, potentially in a network of growth regulatory imprinted genes that includes igf <dig>  cdkn1c  and dlk <dig>  <cit> . most notably, both igf <dig> and the maternally expressed cell cycle inhibitor cdkn1c can contribute to the overgrowth disorders seen in beckwith-wiedemann syndrome  <cit>  and there is evidence that changes in igf <dig> expression can influence expression of cdkn1c  <cit> .

we have previously shown that grb <dig> has multiple roles. the maternal grb <dig> allele acts as an inhibitor of both fetal and placental growth, with mice inheriting a null allele of grb <dig> through the maternal line  being born approximately 25% to 40% larger than their wild type littermates . as adults grb10m/+animals are lean, with increased muscle mass, elevated insulin signalling and an enhanced ability to clear a glucose load . furthermore, expression of the maternal grb <dig> alleles in both mother and offspring have complementary roles that appear to be required for optimal offspring growth and body proportions  <cit> . mice with the paternally-inherited allele of grb <dig> knocked out  exhibit normal growth and physiology, but as adults display increased social dominance, consistent with cns-specific expression from the paternal grb <dig> allele  <cit> . grb <dig> is an adaptor protein capable of interacting with numerous intracellular signalling molecules, notably including receptor tyrosine kinases and mammalian target of rapamycin  . biochemical interactions of grb <dig> with the insulin receptor  and with igf1r are well established  <cit> . while there is good evidence that grb <dig> acts as an inhibitor of insulin signalling in some contexts in vivo  <cit> , mouse genetic experiments indicate that grb <dig> influences fetal and placental growth through a pathway independent of either igf <dig>  <cit> , igf1r or insr . the signalling pathway through which grb <dig> influences growth is currently unknown.

in contrast to the grb10m/+ knockout phenotype, mice inheriting a knockout of the paternal dlk <dig> allele  display significant growth retardation on the day of birth, and as adults are predisposed to accumulate excess adipose  <cit> . transgenic mice overexpressing dlk <dig> from an adipose-specific promoter exhibit reduced adipose mass, impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin resistance  <cit> . the adiposity phenotypes of the dlk <dig> knockout and transgenic mice are consistent with abundant evidence that dlk <dig>  also known as preadipocyte factor- <dig> , is an important regulator of adipogenesis  <cit> . enhanced fetal growth of grb10m/+ mice is associated with expansion of the labyrinthine portion of the placenta  <cit> , whereas placental labyrinth volume is reduced in dlk1+/p mice  <cit> . as adults, grb10m/+ mice have increased muscle mass, due to an increase in myofiber number  <cit> , while dlkl−/− animals exhibit reduced muscle mass associated with a delay in myogenesis during fetal development  <cit> . here, we test the hypothesis that the oppositely imprinted grb <dig> and dlk <dig> genes have antagonistic roles in a common genetic pathway. analyses of growth and physiological phenotypes of grb10m/+/dlk1+/p double knockout animals support this hypothesis. our data indicate that, in addition to the igf pathway, a second mammalian fetal growth regulatory axis exists in which oppositely imprinted genes have evolved roles consistent with the parental conflict hypothesis.

RESULTS
grb10m/+/dlk1+/p double knockout mice have a fetal overgrowth phenotype similar to that of grb10m/+ single knockout mice, including increased cell proliferation along with altered lengths of s- and g2-phases of the cell cycle
to investigate growth phenotypes resulting from ablation of the grb <dig> and dlk <dig> genes, fetal and placental wet weights together with placental efficiencies were analysed at different gestational stages . at embryonic day  <dig>  grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses were significantly heavier than wild type and also dlk1+/p littermate controls, with no statistically significant differences seen in placental mass . both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses and placentae were significantly enlarged at e <dig> , again in comparison with both wild type and dlk1+/p controls . the same trend was observed at e <dig> , with both grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses exhibiting significant overgrowth when compared to wild type and dlk1+/p fetuses, but in the case of placentae statistically significant overgrowth was observed only in comparison to dlk1+/p littermates . determination of fetal/placental weight ratios as a measure of placental efficiency revealed significantly improved efficiencies for both grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p placentae at e <dig>  but not at e <dig>  or e <dig>  . we previously found that grb10m/+ neonates  exhibited disproportionate liver enlargement  <cit> , and here we identified significant overgrowth in wet weights and relative weights of both grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p e <dig>  livers .figure  <dig>

the tissue overgrowth observed from e <dig>  onwards in both grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses might be associated with either, or both, increased cell size and cell number. to investigate the cellular basis of tissue overgrowth we first analysed proliferation rates of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts  derived from e <dig>  fetuses. pmefs were seeded at the same initial density and monitored over a period of 11 days, revealing that grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p cells were hyperproliferative . note that at 24 hours, the first time-point cells were counted after initial seeding, there was essentially no difference in cell numbers. statistical analysis of areas under the growth curves showed that accumulation of pmefs derived from both grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses was significantly increased in comparison with those derived from wild type and dlk1+/p fetuses . no statistically significant deviation from wild type growth was shown by dlk1+/p cells, although they did exhibit a consistent trend to proliferate at a slightly lower rate than wild type cells.figure  <dig>

fluorescence activated cell sorting  was employed to examine the basis for the hyperproliferative phenotype of grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p e <dig>  pmefs and to investigate the possibility of cellular hypertrophy. no deviations from wild type were found in the ranges of cell sizes upon facs analysis of dlk1+/p, grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p cells from e <dig>  fetuses, suggesting that the observed overgrowth phenotypes in grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses were not the result of cell hypertrophy . in contrast, analysis of cell cycle stages revealed statistically significant increases in the proportion of grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p cells in g2-phase compared to dlk1+/p cells, along with decreased numbers of grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p cells in s-phase compared to wild type . to eliminate potential confounds associated with cell culture, facs analysis was also undertaken using freshly derived single cell suspensions from e <dig>  fetuses. we again found no changes in cell size distribution . also consistent with data from pmefs, grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p- fetuses showed significantly higher percentages of cells in g2-phase of the cell cycle, compared to both wild type and dlk1+/p- fetuses, with decreased numbers in s-phase, although this time statistically significant only in comparison to dlk1+/p fetuses .figure  <dig>

at birth and as adults grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice share characteristic changes in body weight and proportions that distinguish them from wild type and dlk1+/p animals
we next analysed body weight, proportions and selected histological features of mice at post-natal stages from the day of birth  to nine months of age. as expected, neonatal dlk1+/p knockout mice were significantly smaller than wild type mice whilst grb10m/+ knockout mice were significantly overgrown . grb10m/+/dlk1+/p double knockout neonates also displayed an overgrowth phenotype, being significantly heavier than wild type and dlk1+/p animals but not significantly different from grb10m/+ single knockouts. analysis of organ wet weights showed that liver, lung and heart were each significantly enlarged in both grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p double knockout neonates , and when expressed as a proportion of body weight, heart  and lung  were essentially in proportion with total body weight, with liver disproportionately enlarged , as previously shown for grb10m/+ mice  <cit> . the wet weights of brain and kidney exhibited no significant differences between the genotypes  and consequently, as a proportion of body weight, appeared enlarged in dlk1+/p neonates and reduced in grb10m/+ neonates . in grb10m/+/dlk1+/p double knockout neonates relative weights of both brain and kidney were significantly different to those of dlk1+/p but not wild type or grb10m/+ animals. lungs of dlk1+/p animals were significantly enlarged in comparison to wild type .figure  <dig>

to investigate if the identified body weight differences detected at birth would persist in postnatal life we next analysed wild type, grb10m/+, dlk1+/p and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice at one week, three to six months and more than six to nine months of age. at one week, persistent overgrowth was seen in grb10m/+  and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p  knockout mice . wet weights of the grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p livers were significantly elevated at this stage . however, when liver weights were expressed as percentages of the total body weights, no significant differences between the genotypes were found, indicating a shift from the disproportionate overgrowth seen at birth to a proportional increase in liver weight in grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice . at three to six and more than six to nine months of age, body weights were again compared, along with wet weights and relative weights of selected organs . only males three- to six-months old showed a significant difference in body weight, with grb10m/+ being heavier than wild type and dlk1+/p animals. several of the analysed organs showed significant differences in weights between genotypes and there was a notable tendency for grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice to group together. these differences included increased pancreas weights and decreased kidney weights in grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice that were consistent between males and females of the same age and/or between animals at the two different ages. the livers of grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice were significantly smaller than those of dlk1+/p animals in males three- to six-months old and exhibited a similar trend in the other adult cohorts.figure  <dig>

grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice share age-related changes in liver histology that distinguish them from wild type and dlk1+/p animals
the differences in liver weight and proportions that we observed in grb10m/+and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice from e <dig>  to adult stages were accompanied by striking changes in histology . in comparisons of tissue sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin  for all four genotypes, no obvious differences were found in e <dig>  fetal liver ; however, the presence of numerous clear, round spaces was noted in neonatal grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p livers  which were also present in approximately half of the examined grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p livers from one-week-old mice . in contrast, grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p livers from three-month-old male mice were essentially indistinguishable from wild type, but at this stage dlk1+/p livers were found to have an abnormal accumulation of larger clear, round spaces . oil red o staining of cryosections revealed that grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p neonatal livers had increased staining compared with wild type and dlk1+/p samples , indicating the accumulation of lipid in a manner consistent with the appearance of clear spaces in h & e stained sections . similarly, oil red o staining of adult liver cryosections revealed marked lipid droplet accumulation in dlk1+/p but not in wild type, grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p , again in keeping with the observation of clear spaces in h & e stained sections .figure  <dig>

dual energy x-ray absorptiometry analysis of adult body composition shows both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice have increased lean tissue content, while dlk1+/p mice have a higher adipose proportion and elevated serum triglycerides
to further evaluate body proportions among mice of the four different genotypes, we performed dual energy x-ray absorptiometry  analyses of adult males  and females . no significant differences in bone mineral density  and bone mineral content  were identified in male mice, indicating no major changes in bone quantity and composition . female dlk1+/p mice had significantly reduced bmc compared to wild type controls, and this was the only difference in bmc or bmd detected . lean tissue content was significantly increased for grb10m/+ male mice when compared to wild type and dlk1+/p mice and also in grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice when compared to dlk1+/p . grb10m/+ female mice also had significantly higher content of lean tissue, but only when compared to dlk1+/p . when expressed as a percentage of the total, lean mass of grb10m/+ mice was significantly increased compared to dlk1+/p mice, both in males  and females . no significant differences were observed in absolute values for adipose tissue content of males  or females ; however, when expressed as a percentage of total body mass, adipose tissue content was significantly increased in dlk1+/p compared to grb10m/+ for both males  and females . in support of this observation, serum triglyceride concentration measured in adult males was found to be significantly elevated in dlk1+/p mice when compared to grb10m/+ mice  and the wet weight of both gonadal and renal adipose depots was significantly increased in females at three to six months of age . changes in lean:adipose body proportions were not accompanied by any obvious changes in white adipose tissue histomorphometry  or food consumption . dlk <dig> knockout mice derived independently of those used in this study were shown to exhibit transient adipocyte hypotrophy  <cit> , with mean adipocyte size being reduced in the analysed adipose depots at six weeks of age, but not at sixteen weeks. our adipose measurements were carried out on a cohort of three-month-old animals and transient adipocyte hypotrophy in younger dlk1+/p animals has not been excluded.figure  <dig>

previous studies have shown that in grb10m/+ knockout mice increased lean:adipose body proportions and elevated insulin signalling were associated with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity  <cit> . conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing grb <dig> exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance  <cit> . there are no published studies of glucose or insulin tolerance in dlk <dig> knockout mice, but transgenic mice overexpressing dlk <dig> exhibit reduced adipose deposition, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance  <cit> . consequently, we performed glucose tolerance tests  on mice of all four genotypes used in this study . in all cases, following intraperitoneal injection of fasted animals with a bolus of glucose, blood glucose concentration showed an initial sharp rise followed by a gradual decline, consistent with insulin mediated glucose uptake. compared to wild type controls, curves plotted for dlk1+/p mice showed impaired glucose clearance, while those for grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice showed enhanced glucose clearance, both for males  and females . comparisons of the area under each curve revealed significant differences in glucose clearance between dlk1+/p and both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice, again for both males and females .figure  <dig>

neonatal grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice have thickened lung epithelia compared with wild type and dlk1+/p mice, whereas no differences were detected in histology of kidney and pancreas, or in skeletal morphology
following the previous reports of neonatal death in a minority of grb10m/+ mice that was associated with blood filled lung alveoli  <cit>  and pulmonary defects noted in dlk <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , we performed histological analyses of neonatal lungs . measurements of lung epithelial walls showed that both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice had significantly thicker epithelial walls when compared to either dlk1+/p or wild type animals . similar morphometric analysis of adult lung showed no differences between any of the four genotypes, indicating that the thickened lung epithelial wall phenotype did not persist into adulthood .figure  <dig>

skeletal malformations were previously reported in dlk <dig> knockout mice  <cit>  and the soluble form of dlk <dig>  fetal antigen- <dig> , has been identified as a novel endocrine factor regulating chondrocyte differentiation in vitro  <cit> , as well as bone and adipose mass in vivo  <cit> . our grb <dig> knockout mice incorporate a β-galactosidase reporter gene within the grb <dig> locus that we have previously found to recapitulate endogenous grb <dig> expression patterns in both fetal and adult tissues , although expression can be low at specific sites where grb <dig> appears to be regulated by stat <dig>  <cit> . here we employed lacz staining to examine grb <dig> expression in neonatal bones, with expression readily detected in growth plates of grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p animals, indicating a possible role for grb <dig> in growth of long bones during skeletogenesis . however, staining of skeletal preparations of mice of all four genotypes with alcian blue and alizarin red to highlight cartilage and bone, respectively, revealed no obvious skeletal defects , including those previously described for dlk <dig> knockout mice. this difference in the mice used by ourselves and moon et al.  <cit>  could be due to the precise nature of the engineered mutations or their maintenance on different strain backgrounds. nevertheless, the observed expression of grb <dig> in the growth plate of long bones is consistent with a role in skeletogenesis, which could contribute to the growth phenotype of grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice.

use of the lacz insert at the grb <dig> locus in our knockout mice revealed that the maternal grb <dig> allele is expressed in adult kidney, most obviously in the proximal tubules . this, together with the observation of altered kidney proportions in grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p mice , prompted us to examine adult kidneys in more detail. however, we detected no obvious differences in histology of adult kidney among animals of the four genotypes used in this study  and in all cases there was no evidence of compromised kidney function as judged by analysis of protein content of urine samples collected from mice at three months of age . the observed expression pattern may be relevant to the tumour suppressor role proposed for grb <dig> in small cell renal cell carcinoma  <cit> , a prevalent adult kidney cancer thought to arise predominantly from the proximal tubule  <cit> .

discussion
paternally-expressed igf <dig> and maternally-expressed igf2r were the first imprinted genes to be identified and their opposite growth regulatory roles were quickly recognised to fit with predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis  <cit> . genetic crosses between females heterozygous for an igf2r knockout allele and males heterozygous for an igf <dig> knockout allele revealed that the growth inhibitory function of igf2r could be attributed entirely to an antagonistic interaction with igf <dig>  <cit> . this conclusion derives from the observation that the growth of igf2rm/+/igf2+/p double knockout offspring was indistinguishable from that of igf2+/p knockout littermates. although not a prerequisite of the hypothesis, the fact that the opposing functions of the two genes were enacted through direct interaction of their gene products made the case for a parental ‘tug-of-war’ even more compelling  <cit> . here, we have carried out a test for epistasis between grb <dig> and dlk <dig>  oppositely imprinted genes with contrasting effects on fetal growth, adiposity and glucose homeostasis . we carried out detailed analyses of wild type, grb10m/+ and dlk1+/p single knockout, and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p double knockout mice for features related to growth and metabolic phenotypes previously established as characteristic of either single knockout. quantitative phenotyping consistently revealed that grb10m/+/dlk1+/p double knockout and grb10m/+ mice closely resemble each other, such that they are never significantly different, and are distinct from wild type and dlk1+/p mice. distinguishing phenotypic characters include growth during early life, cell cycle profiles, tissue proportions, glucose regulated metabolism and specific histological features, notably lipid storage in the liver. these findings support the notion that grb <dig> and dlk <dig> act in the same genetic pathway, with dlk <dig> acting upstream of grb <dig>  in order to promote growth dlk <dig> must inhibit grb <dig>  which is in turn a growth inhibitor .figure  <dig> 
model of the genetic interaction between
dlk1
and
grb10
. normal growth is observed only in wild type animals, with intact grb <dig> and dlk <dig> genes. gene knockout  of maternal grb1o  results in overgrowth, whereas knockout of paternal dlk <dig>  results in growth restriction. simultaneous knockout of both genes  results in overgrowth, with associated changes in body proportions, histology and physiology, essentially as in grb10
m/+ mice. thus, grb <dig> is an inhibitor of fetal growth while dlk <dig> acts to promote growth by inhibition of grb <dig> 



disruption of the maternal grb <dig> allele has previously been shown to result in fetal and placental overgrowth . grb10m/+ mice are at birth around 25% to 40% larger than wild type littermates, with significant differences in weight first apparent in the fetus at e <dig>  and in the placenta at e <dig> . in addition, the enlarged grb10m/+ placenta was found to be significantly more efficient than the wild type placenta from e <dig>   <cit> . in the present study, the overgrowth phenotype of grb10m/+ mice was similar in both magnitude and timing to that previously observed, with significantly increased placental efficiency again manifest from e <dig> . at the three gestational stages examined dlk1+/p fetal and placental weights were consistently lower than those of wild type littermates, but not statistically significantly so. similar data were reported recently for a different dlk <dig> knockout strain  <cit> ; however, the small decreases in fetal weight are likely to have biological significance as our dlk1+/p mice were at birth significantly smaller  than their wild type littermates, again as previously reported  <cit> . with the exception of e <dig>  placentae, weights of dlk1+/p offspring were always significantly lower than those of both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p offspring. importantly, grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p offspring closely resembled each other and were never significantly different.

the close resemblance of grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p offspring was also apparent in comparisons of tissue proportions. we have previously noted disproportionate liver overgrowth in grb10m/+ pups at birth  <cit>  and here this was seen in both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p offspring at birth and at e <dig> . at these stages liver was proportionate to body size in dlk1+/p mice, whereas kidney was significantly enlarged compared to wild type controls. in both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p the kidneys of neonates were significantly reduced as a proportion of body weight. brain weight remained essentially unchanged in neonates of all four genotypes, such that it was enlarged in proportion to body weight in dlk1+/p and proportionately small in grb10m/+ neonates. we have noted this effect before in grb10m/+ neonates, which correlates with the lack of expression from the maternal grb <dig> allele in the developing brain  <cit> . this is consistent with the grb10/dlk <dig> growth regulatory pathway having a brain ‘sparing’ role  <cit> , under conditions in which fetal growth is restricted, notably when nutrients are limiting. the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood but in drosophila sparing of the cns under starvation conditions has been linked with tissue-specific modifications in pi3k/tor signalling  <cit> . the tor  pathway is highly conserved, with key roles in nutrient sensing and growth factor signalling  <cit> . thus, a brain sparing role for grb <dig> through the established interaction with mtor  <cit>  is plausible.

growth rates of pmefs derived from e <dig>  fetuses showed differences between genotypes that were in keeping with the observed fetal growth phenotypes. thus, while dlk1+/p fibroblasts proliferated slowly  compared to wild type, both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fibroblasts exhibited a significantly higher proliferation rate. facs analyses of e <dig>  fetus-derived fibroblasts revealed for both grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p cells a significant reduction in the number of cells in s-phase of the cell cycle, with a concomitant increased number in g <dig>  the same facs profile was observed for cells derived from disaggregated e <dig>  fetuses. these facs data, together with the fibroblast proliferation rates, indicate that the enhanced growth of grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses is associated with more rapid progress through s-phase. grb <dig> overexpression in an in vitro leukaemia model was associated with increased cell numbers in s-phase, increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis  <cit> , suggesting that its role in cell cycle regulation is highly context dependent. the facs data from e <dig>  fetal cells indicates that the cell cycle changes we observed are physiologically relevant and, logically, manifest before any significant effect on fetal weight can be detected . this is analogous to the early detection of cell cycle changes in igf <dig> knockout mice   <cit> , but whereas the major cell cycle changes in igf2+/p fetuses were focused within a narrow developmental window , our pmef data suggest that altered cell cycle regulation in grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p fetuses extends at least until e <dig> .

body and tissue weights were analysed at three further post-natal stages: one week, three to six months and more than six to nine months. weights and tissue proportions were consistently similar between grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p animals and were unlike those of wild type and/or dlk1+/p animals. notably, adult dlk1+/p mice exhibited a tendency to accumulate excess adipose that is in keeping with a previous report  <cit> , although in that case increased adiposity was revealed after placing the mice on a high fat diet. a third dlk <dig> knockout strain, maintained on a regular diet and consistently having a reduced body weight  in comparison with wild type controls, exhibited no significant changes in the weights of several adipose depots  <cit> . in contrast, grb10m/+ and also grb10m/+/dlk1+/p adults tended to have greater lean mass, although this was not as pronounced as in previous studies of grb10m/+ animals , which we suspect can be attributed to the genotype of the grb <dig> heterozygote mothers used in different crosses. here, the females used as mothers were themselves grb10m/+ animals and, therefore, large at birth and lean as adults, whereas the grb10+/p mothers used in previous studies were effectively wild type in growth and physiology. this needs to be verified but is interesting because it indicates that the environment provided to offspring by grb10m/+ and grb10+/p mothers during pregnancy and/or the post-natal suckling period is different and has a long-standing effect on offspring physiology. this is consistent with a role for grb <dig> in developmental programming of offspring growth and metabolism, as previously suggested by ourselves  <cit>  and others  <cit> .

the more subtle change in lean:adipose proportions seen in grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p animals in this study is also noteworthy when considering that animals of both genotypes exhibited an enhanced ability to clear a glucose load similar in magnitude to that previously reported in grb10m/+ mice  <cit> . previous studies have shown that grb10m/+ mice exhibit elevated insulin signalling in muscle and white adipose tissue , but it was unclear whether this made a major contribution to their improved glucose tolerance because they also had significantly increased lean/muscle mass . here, the clear improvement in glucose tolerance with a less dramatic increase in muscle mass suggests that enhanced insulin signalling does have a major effect on glucose homeostasis in grb10m/+  animals. this conclusion is supported by a recent report showing that cultured primary myotubes derived from grb10−/− mice exhibit enhanced glucose uptake and insulin signalling  <cit> .

the changes in adiposity in dlk1+/p , grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p  animals were reflected in serum triglyceride levels and in histological changes seen in liver at different developmental stages. grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p animals had at birth disproportionately enlarged livers with a high lipid content compared to wild type and dlk1+/p livers. at one week of age, evidence of high lipid content could be seen in only around 50% of grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p livers, consistent with the down-regulation of grb <dig> in liver and other tissues post-natally  <cit> . in adulthood, grb10m/+ and grb10m/+/dlk1+/p livers had a low lipid content and weighed less than those of wild type controls, whereas dlk1+/p livers had a high lipid content. dlk <dig> has established roles in influencing proliferation and differentiation of several tissues, including adipose  and skeletal muscle  <cit> . the developmental mechanisms through which grb <dig> regulates growth and tissue proportions are less well understood, although recent evidence indicates that primary cultures of muscle cells from grb10−/− mice exhibit increased rates of proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . our data indicate roles for both grb <dig> and dlk <dig> in regulating adipose distribution that is consistent with the recognised role for dlk <dig> in inhibiting adipocyte differentiation. it will be important in the future to focus greater attention on grb <dig> as a potential regulator of the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, not least in the tissues where it has an established physiological role, including adipose  <cit> , skeletal muscle  <cit>  and now liver.

the molecular basis of the interaction between grb <dig> and dlk <dig> is currently unknown and may not be direct as in the case of igf <dig> and igf2r. since our genetic experiments indicate that dlk <dig> operates upstream of grb <dig> , the most parsimonious prediction would be that dlk <dig> acts as a ligand for a cell surface receptor that in turn interacts with grb <dig>  the grb <dig> adaptor protein is capable of interacting with many receptors and downstream signalling components, including mtor . conversely, the receptor for dlk <dig> are unknown. although dlk <dig> shares amino acid sequence homology with members of the delta/serrate family of ligands it lacks the motifs known to be important for interaction with the notch family of receptors  <cit> . despite this there is in vitro evidence that dlk <dig> may act as an inhibitor of the notch <dig> receptor, but also that it can influence other signalling pathways, including erk/mapk, akt/pi3k and mtor  signalling. thus, there is ample scope for dlk <dig> and grb <dig> to interact in key growth factor signalling pathways. further work on our single and double knockout mouse models will be required to establish the molecular pathway between dlk <dig> and grb <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
based on the accumulated evidence we propose that grb <dig> and dlk <dig> may define a mammalian growth-regulatory axis that is separate from the igf pathway, yet is similar in having as key components a pair of oppositely imprinted genes with antagonistic functions. this is only the second clear example of a pair of imprinted genes with such antagonistic roles, after igf <dig> and igf2r.
