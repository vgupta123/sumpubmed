BACKGROUND
histopathology remains one of the most critical steps in the diagnosis and treatment of virtually any kind of cancer. the incidence of cancer has remained fairly constant since the early 1990's, with an average of  <dig>  new cases per  <dig>  americans documented in  <dig>  <cit> . mortality from all types of cancer in  <dig> was  <dig>   <cit> , and remains the second leading cause of death in the united states  <cit> . in the u.s., nearly  <dig>  men and women were diagnosed with head and neck cancer in  <dig>  <cit> . head and neck cancers are highly fatal, and survival rates have not decreased notably over time  <cit> .

the treatment for many types of cancer, including head and neck cancers, consists of surgical removal followed by histopathologic examination. in the diagnosis of head and neck cancer, tumor biopsy is one of last phases after a group of preliminary check such as historical, physical and non-invasive examination. basically, biopsy procedure involves excising region-of-interest and sending the specimen to the histopathologist for detailed investigation under microscope. although biopsies, especially the ones that are deep inside the body or grew in problematic-to-operate locations, are painful for the patients, they are important for cancer classification.

one major factor that affects the prognosis of patients with head and neck cancer is regional lymph node metastases, the spread of malignant cells from primary site. accordingly, sentinel lymph node biopsy  is broadly accepted as a first, more convenient and less painful way of prognosis. thus, histopathologists investigate not only biopsy of head and neck tumor but also biopsy of lymph nodes. accurate evaluation is required for neck management and improvement of head and neck cancer patient survivals.

traditionally, selective neck lymph node dissection is essential for neck metastasis evaluation and this procedure requires removal of many lymph nodes in several regions, which is associated with increased morbidity, such as spinal accessory nerve dysfunction and related shoulder disability. in an attempt to avoid unnecessary treatment to the clinically negative neck and thus, decrease morbidity, the sentinel lymph node biopsy technique , a minimally invasive technique, is increasingly used in the place of selective neck lymph node dissection and is emerging as a successful means of identifying occult malignant cells of neck lymph nodes in patients with head and neck cancer. the second international conference on sentinel node biopsy in mucosal head and neck cancer held in september  <dig>  has sufficiently validated slnb as a useful approach of neck staging for early head and neck cancer based on multi-center studies. at the conference, the use of conventional haematoxylin and eosin  staining on step-sections of the entire node cut at intervals of  <dig> μm is recommended consequently.

for this particular reason, histopathologic examination is mandatory in selective and suspicious cases. but, tedious work required for the preparation and review of many histological sections  is a notable limiting factor for generalized adoption of this potentially very useful technique in pathology laboratories. additionally, some rural areas may not have enough pathologists for examining large number of slides. as a result, automated systems such as computer aided diagnosis  that enable accurate screening of large number of digital slides, and report the suspicious slides for further examination by the pathologists would be a significant help for histopathologists.

recent improvements in imaging techniques led to discovery of virtual histological slides, where an automated light microscope  <cit>  scans a glass slide and generates a virtual slide at a resolution of  <dig>  μm/pixel. output images are of sufficiently high quality to attract immense interest within the research community. high-resolution medical imaging technique combined with pattern recognition has led to a new research area: tumor delineation in high-resolution histopathologic slides. to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study in the literature addressing high-resolution, wholly-scanned histopathologic slide understanding in the context of cad. when compared with other types of medical images, computer-assisted tumor identification in histopathological slides is emerging branch in both medical and computer sciences.

in conjunction with traditional histological review by pathologists, recognition of cancer cells in histopathologic slides generated en masse and cheaply by special high-resolution scanners has great potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of evaluating cancer in primer location and sentinel lymph node. high-speed slide scanners automatically generate much larger number of tissue sections from any single tissue at smaller intervals, thus can increase the sensitivity of overall system by detecting small malignant cells that would otherwise escape from human eye. as expected, the larger cut interval, the lower chance histopathologists can investigate whole malignancy using current techniques.

in this study we conduct a pioneering work to determine how accurately a computer can be trained to recognize small tumor cells in high-resolution images. introduced framework can be seen in figure  <dig>  thanks to high-resolution digital microscopes, the framework scans and evaluates hundreds of histological sections of tumor at much higher efficiency. in this study a quite common staining procedure, namely haematoxylin and eosin , is chosen to dye slides. as invasive head and neck tumor cells differ from normal tissue regarding cancer cell morphologies, we particularly concentrate on distinguishing cell irregularities and color differences in cells. image understanding using subimages is more practical for machine learning approaches since malignant regions show similar characteristics in small scale. hence, we introduce a subimage-based annotation system using local features rather than global features. therefore, the first step in the data preparation is to partition every slide into subimages. in general, the framework learns from subimages that are labeled as positive and negative by pathologist; and attempts to identify areas that contain tumor cells. the main advantage of this model is to guide pathologists through their decisions on histopathological slides by exploiting high throughput of whole slide imaging systems. when compared with other histopathological image understanding scenarios  <cit> , and  <cit>  which only look for cell anomalies locally, whole-slide processing exploiting cluster-based features makes our avenue unique in this domain. in addition, thanks to this innovative approach and parallel dbscan  <cit> , hundreds of slides can be examined at one time in a grid environment  <cit> .

RESULTS
in this section, we first describe the datasets used for the evaluation of our framework. we then report the performance using standard measures. additionally we analyze the results and give a discussion of the performance of the system.

in our study we use seven histopathological slides. four slides have malignant areas that are delineated by pathologist. on the other hand, no malignant area is assessed in three slides. subsequently, four whole slides with malignant regions and the other three healthy slides are labeled as positive  and negative  respectively. table  <dig> summaries image resolutions for slides used in this study. each whole slide is further divided into subimages. the size of these subimages is fixed to  <dig> ×  <dig>  examples of such subimages are shown in figure  <dig>  the first row shows three negative subimages; and the second row shows three positive subimages. we collect  <dig> positive  and  <dig> negative  subimages from slide p <dig> and  <dig> negative subimages from slide n <dig>  to delineate cancer areas, we train a two-class support vector machine . the trained svm is then tested on the remaining subimages in all seven histopathological slides.

we evaluated the performance of proposed framework by recall, precision and predictive accuracy that are based on true positive , false positive , true negative , false negative  in terms of subimages. to avoid confusion with the terms used to evaluate our system, we refer the reader to confusion matrix. for a binary classification problem like this study, the elements of the matrix are shown in table  <dig>  precision , recall and accuracy are very common measures in binary classifications. precision is defined as the percentage of positive predictions that are correct, and calculated by tptp+fp

since fn and fp ratio are the major concern for cad systems, we conducted a set of experiments to investigate the performance in terms of precision and recall. the plots of recall vs. precision for positive slides were depicted in figure  <dig> . as one can see, the trained svm achieve good precision and recall on all positive slides. again it demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately detect most malignant areas. for the negative slides, it is important to minimize the false positive. we use fptn+fp

additionally, a visual comparison of the pathologist's assessment and predicted tumor region by our framework for slide p <dig> was shown in figure  <dig>  it shows that there is a good match between the pathologist's assessment and the outcome of our method.

we measured the running time for our method on pentium  <dig>  <dig>  ghz workstation equipped with  <dig> gb memory. average runtime to completely draw region-of-tumor, which includes all the phases of the method is presented in figure  <dig>  as one can see that the negative slides comparably take less time than that of positive ones due to the fact that there are usually more positive areas in positive slides; and it took more time to outline positive areas than negative areas.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we presented a new algorithm to detect tumors by using one of the latest imaging technologies, virtual histological slides. we studied a total of seven wholly-scanned neck and cancer tissues. with the intention of having best classification accuracy on the problem of squamous cell carcinoma detection, we exploited density-based clustering algorithm dbscan  <cit>  for feature extraction in equi-size subimages, which are obtained from the systematic partitioning of original slides. the delineation of malignant regions is achieved by using a powerful classification algorithm, namely svms, that depends on the features extracted by using our newly proposed cell nuclei clustering technique, which plays an important role in the discussed framework. we chose recall, precision, and predictive accuracy as the evaluation criteria. the experiment results validate our framework by providing an average accuracy of 96% on all positive slides and low ratio of false positives on all negative slides. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that deals with wholly-scanned histopathological slides at the cellular level targeting cad applications.

future work will be more on the dependency analysis between cancer and healthy areas. it seems that the current framework can be applied not only to the classification of head and neck cancer, but also to other type of cancers, such as breast and colon cancer. we will investigate the applicability of our framework for various types of cancer in the future.
