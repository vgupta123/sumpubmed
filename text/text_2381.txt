BACKGROUND
anthropogenic selection applied during the domestication and improvement of a crop species inevitably reduces its genetic base, while its non-domesticated wild relatives retain genetic diversity. the wild relatives thus represent a valuable genetic resource for breeders. introgressing genetic material from a wild species is conventionally attempted via sexual hybridization  <cit> , but somatic hybridization  can offer an alternative route, especially where viable sexual hybrids have proven difficult or impossible to establish  <cit> . unlike in an allopolyploid, where the two  parental nuclear genomes are combined with a uniparental cytoplasm , in a somatic hybrid, both the nucleus and the cytoplasm are biparental. in a refinement of the approach, termed asymmetric hybridization, the donor cells are irradiated prior to the fusion process, which has the effect of reducing the contribution of the donor’s genome to the somatic hybrid, thereby promoting the introgression of smaller donor segments  <cit> .

bread wheat  is an allohexaploid species which has evolved through two successive natural hybridizations. the first brought together the genomes of an as yet unidentified  member of the sitopsis section of the genus aegilops  and t. urartu  to form the allotetraploid ba genome species t. turgidum  <cit> . the second event involved a domesticated form of t. turgidum and ae. tauschii  to form the bread wheat bad genome  <cit> . allopolyploidy, in forcing a pair of non-identical genomes to co-exist within a single nucleus, has been associated with a range of genomic rearrangements and dna modifications  <cit> , encapsulated by the term “genomic shock”  <cit> . some of these changes affect gene expression, either by altering gene sequences and/or by altering their epigenetic regulation , thereby providing the polyploid genome with extensive potential for novelty and plasticity . once a wide hybrid  has been established, introgression from one parental genome to the other can occur via recombination or meiosis-driven chromosome breakage and reunion. in an asymmetric somatic hybrid, the pre-hybridization irradiation treatment of the donor cells has the effect of fragmenting its genome, so introgression can occur via end-joining of fragments, most easily during the course of mitosis  <cit> . this event also leads to a strong genomic shock and therefore induces genomic variation. however, in asymmetric somatic fused cells, most donor chromatin is eliminated, and very small amount of chromatin fragments are introgressed into the recipient genome. thus, chromosomal rearrangement and large fragment deletion, the common events during the process of diploidization of allopolyploidies, seldom happen in asymmetric somatic hybrid cells  <cit> . this difference between the chromosomal behaviors in asymmetric somatic hybrids and allopolyploidies suggest that their patterns of genomic variation may be distinct from each other.

we previously generated an asymmetric somatic hybrid between the bread wheat cultivar jn <dig>  and tall wheatgrass   via fusing the wheat protoplast and uv-irradiated tall wheatgrass protoplast , and a number of derivatives of this hybrid have been selected based on the expression of a favorable phenotype  <cit> . some of these lines have proven to be stably introgressed with several  observed chromatin fragments of tall wheatgrass by cytogenetic analysis  <cit> , and be sufficiently phenotypically stable to allow their release as a novel cultivar  <cit> . one of these is the cultivar sr <dig> whose genome possesses five observed fragments of tall wheatgrass  <cit> . it has demonstrated improved levels of tolerance to both salinity and drought, and higher yield in saline land than its parent jn <dig>  <cit> ; the tolerance is partially due to the high tolerance to oxidative stress and superior ability of redox homeostasis maintenance  <cit> . we found that the genome of sr <dig> and other derivatives occurred high frequency of genetic variation using a set of molecular biomarker assays  <cit> , and had numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion/deletion  when comparing genomic sequences of glutenin gene family  <cit> . moreover, such genetic variation was majorly induced by asymmetric somatic hybridization, while the contribution of other factors such as protoplast formation, uv radiation, callus induction and plant regeneration was quite slight  <cit> . however, the characteristics of sequence variation such as nucleotide substitution and indel at the genome-scale level as well as its difference from polyploidization have not been addressed. although contrasting allelic sequences have been identified between sr <dig> and jn <dig> associated mostly with genes involved in the response to abiotic stress  <cit> , a more global picture of the alterations induced by asymmetric somatic hybridization awaits the application of genome-wide re-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis. while global genomic re-sequencing remains overambitious given the large size of the wheat genome  <cit>  along with the high content of repeat sequences   <cit> , current dna sequencing platforms are well capable of uncovering sequence variation in the transcriptome. here, the sequencing of a large number of cdnas isolated from both sr <dig> and jn <dig> is described and used to show the extent of the sequence variation induced by asymmetric somatic hybridization.

RESULTS
cdna sequencing
a total of  <dig>  sr <dig> and  <dig>  jn <dig> clones were sequenced, resulting in the acquisition of, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig> usable sequences . the sequences resolved into  <dig> unigenes  from sr <dig>  and  <dig> unigenes  from jn <dig>  of which full length cdnas were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the length of most of the unigenes laid in the range 700–1000 nt , and their mean gc content was  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % . the blastn analysis of the unigenes revealed that  <dig> were shared  between sr <dig> and jn <dig> . in all,  <dig>  of the jn <dig> and  <dig>  of the sr <dig> unigenes shared >96 % identity with sequences represented in the wheat est database .table  <dig> blastn-based homology comparisons of unigene sequences

frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the unigene sequences
based on the unigene sequences sharing >96 % identity,  <dig>  snps were identified within the unigene sequence shared between sr <dig> and jn <dig>  equivalent to a snp frequency of  <dig>  per 1000 nt of coding sequence . the transition and transversion frequencies were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000 nt. the snp frequency between jn <dig> and the sequences represented in the wheat est database  was only about one half of this level  , demonstrating that the somatic hybridization process was effective in inducing point mutations. a comparison based on the sequences of the unigenes shared between the ba progenitor tetraploid  and the a genome carrier t. monococcum revealed a snp frequency of  <dig>  per 1000 nt, while that between t. turgidum and ae. speltoides  was  <dig> , indicating that a high frequency of mutation was induced during the formation of allotetraploid wheat. similarly, the estimated snp frequencies between bread wheat and t. monococcum, ae. speltoides, t. turgidum and ae. tauschii  were, respectively,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000 nt . thus the mutation frequency induced by the somatic hybridization process appeared to be similar in extent to that induced by allopolyploidization. the frequency of snps between the unigene sequences of bread wheat and those of either t. monococcum or ae. speltoides was less than that between t. turgidum and either t. monococcum or ae. speltoides unigenes . this coincided with the finding that the snp frequency of sr <dig> and wheat database est  was lower than those of the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> alignment . the snp frequency between sr <dig> unigene sequences and those of the a, b, ba and d genome species was similar to those between jn <dig> unigenes and those of the a, b, ba and d genome species .table  <dig> the snp frequencies in sr <dig> and jn177

the size distribution of indels in the unigene sequences
the indels ranged from 1 nt to 574 nt, and a majority of the indels involved only 1 nt. a significant number of indels was revealed by aligning the matched unigene sequences, with the frequency of larger indels  being clearly less than that of the small ones  . there had  <dig>  % unigenes possessing small indels when compared between sr <dig> and jn <dig>  higher than those from sr <dig> vs ta and jn <dig> vs ta comparisons. on the contrary,  <dig>  % unigenes had large indels in the comparison between sr <dig> and jn <dig>  lower than those of other two comparisons. there had more unigenes with small insertions than those with small deletions, and the difference was stronger in the sr <dig> vs ta and jn <dig> vs ta comparisons. unigenes with large insertions were similar to those with large deletions in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison, but unigenes with large deletions were more abundant than those with large insertions in the other two comparisons. the comparison between the jn <dig>  unigene sequences with those represented in the wheat est database showed that for small indels, the ratio of insertion to deletion frequency was negatively correlated to indel length  ; the ratio was > <dig> for indels shorter than 6 nt, and < <dig> for indels longer than 6 nt. however, for the larger indels, the insertion to deletion ratio was positively correlated to indel length  ; in indels ranging in length from  <dig> to 70 nt, the ratio was just  <dig> – <dig> , rising to  <dig> – <dig>  for indels of length 71–200 nt, and to ~ <dig>  for indels longer than 200 nt . the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison revealed an insertion to deletion ratio of ~ <dig> irrespective of indel length .table  <dig> indel variation in sr <dig> and jn <dig> unigene sequences

“small” indels were defined as those lying within an aligned sequence, while “large” indels split matched sequence into two separate alignments. the table shows the percentage of unigenes affected by insertion/deletions. sr3-jn177: jn <dig> unigene sequences queried with those of sr <dig>  sr3-ta: sr <dig> unigene sequences queried with wheat ests housed in genbank. jn177-ta: jn <dig> unigene sequences queried with wheat ests housed in genbank

the frequency of indels in the unigene sequences
small indels were used to calculate the indel frequency because they were markedly more abundant than large indels . in all, the  <dig> matched unigenes derived from the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison revealed  <dig> indels . based on the jn <dig> sequences, these comprised  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions in sr <dig>  equivalent to frequencies of, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000 nt . in the comparison with the sequences represented in the wheat est database, the indel frequency in sr <dig> was  <dig>  per 1000 nt. the similar comparison between jn <dig> and the sequences represented in the wheat est database revealed an indel frequency of only  <dig>  per 1000 nt, implying that the asymmetric somatic hybridization process was effective in inducing indels in coding sequence.table  <dig> the frequency of small indels in sr <dig> and jn <dig> unigene sequences

“small” and “large” indels defined as in table  <dig>  indel frequency was expressed as the number of indels per 1000 nt of unigene sequence



to compare the induction rates of indels caused by somatic hybridization and allopolyploidization, equivalent calculations were made using the matched unigene sequences present in bread wheat and its relatives/progenitor species . comparing the unigenes of t. turgidum with those of t. monococcum and ae. speltoides revealed an indel frequency of, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000; the equivalents between bread wheat and its various related species ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  per 1000 nt, with the comparison involving ae. tauschii producing the highest estimate. the indel frequencies estimated using the unigenes of jn <dig> and sr <dig> also lay in the range  <dig> to  <dig> per 1000 nt, with the exception of the comparison with ae. tauschii, where the frequencies were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000 nt .

in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison, the insertion frequency  was  <dig>  fold to the deletion frequency  . based on the sequences represented in the wheat est database, the insertion frequencies were higher by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold than deletion frequencies in sr <dig> and jn <dig>  respectively. especially, the insertion frequency in the sr <dig> vs ta comparison  was similar to the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison , but its indel frequency was lower than the latter. thus, the preference to small insertion was decreased in wheat asymmetric somatic hybrids in comparison with allopolyploid wheat.

the function of unigenes showing sequence polymorphism
to know whether the genetic variation is associated with their biological processes, we selected sequences participating in gene expression regulation and other processes for analysis. a selection of polymorphic unigenes represented in the jn <dig> and sr <dig> libraries  as well as in the wheat est database showed that for gene expression regulation, the frequency of snps differed most notably in genes involved in nucleosome assembly and chromatin assembly/disassembly . the least polymorphic comparison was between jn <dig> and the wheat est database unigenes . the same comparison between sr <dig> and jn <dig> produced, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps per 1000 nt. the next most variable genes were those encoding products involved in translation and post-translational modification, where the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison revealed a snp frequency of, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000 nt, while the jn <dig> vs ta comparison showed  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the range in snp frequency for genes associated with metabolic processes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  per 1000 nt in the jn <dig> vs ta comparison and  <dig> – <dig>  per 1000 nt in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison . snp frequencies were also higher in the sr <dig> vs ta comparison than in the jn <dig> vs ta comparison for genes encoding proteins involved in various metabolic processes except for glycolysis as well as nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process . this difference in snp frequencies was also found in ests of protein fate, transport, cell redox homeostasis, and response to  stress . with respect to unigenes varying at the level of indels, the frequency of polymorphism was lower in the jn <dig> vs ta than in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison . indel events were noticeably rare in genes involved in nucleosome assembly and chromatin assembly/disassembly . the respective frequencies were  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000 nt in the jn <dig> vs ta comparison and  <dig>  and  <dig>  per 1000 nt in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison.table  <dig> the function of unigenes affected by snp and indels in sr <dig> and jn177

sequences flanking indels in the unigenes
the sequences flanking indels were characterized by calculating the gc content of the ten nucleotides flanking either side of the indel. there was no obvious difference in gc content between 5′ and 3′ terminal flanking sequence in any of the comparisons  . the trend of gc content was similar when the second to tenth nucleotides of the flanking sequence were considered . the gc content of the nucleotides positioned three, six and nine away from the indels was higher than that of the ones positioned four, five, seven or eight away in the 3′ terminal flanking sequences, but the rule was not found in the 5′ terminal flanking sequences. the gc content of the flanking sequence was higher in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison  than in the other two comparisons . in the sr <dig> vs ta and jn <dig> vs ta comparisons, the gc content of the flanking sequence of the deletions was higher than that of the insertions, while the content of the indels was close to that of the insertions. however, in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison, the gc content of the flanking sequence of the deletions was generally lower than that of the insertions, and the difference between the deletions and insertions was weaker than that in the jn <dig> or sr <dig> vs ta comparisons; the content of the flanking sequence of the indels did not bias toward either the deletions or insertions. in the jn <dig> or sr <dig> vs ta comparisons, with respect to the nucleotide lying on the 5′ side of the indels, the gc content of the nucleotide adjacent to the deletions was significantly lower than that of other nucleotides in the flanking sequence, but the gc content of the nucleotide adjacent to the insertions was significantly higher than that of other nucleotides in the flanking sequence . on the other hand, for the nucleotides lying on the 3′ side of the indels, the gc content of the nucleotide adjacent to the deletions remained high and was comparable to that of the second and third flanking nucleotides, but the gc content of the nucleotide adjacent to the insertions was significantly lower than that of the other flanking nucleotides . in contrast in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison, for the nucleotides lying on the 5′ side of the indel, the gc content of the nucleotide adjacent to both the deletions and insertions was higher than that of the second to tenth nucleotides of the 5′ flanking sequence, while for the nucleotides lying on the 3′ side of the indels, the gc content of the nucleotide adjacent to both the deletions and insertions was lower than the second and third nucleotides .fig.  <dig> variation in the gc content in the sequence immediately flanking indels. a: sr3-jn <dig>  jn <dig> unigene sequences queried with those of sr <dig>  b: sr3-ta, sr <dig> unigene sequences queried with wheat ests housed in genbank. c: jn177-ta, jn <dig> unigene sequences queried with wheat ests housed in genbank. -10 ~ −1: the tenth to first nucleotides on the 5′ side of the indel. 1 ~ 10: the first to tenth nucleotides on the 3′ side of the indel. in-mean, del-mean and indel-mean: the gc content of 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences of insertions, deletions and indels, respectively



indel classification
we further compared the characteristic of flanking sequences of large indels in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison. the flanking sequences of  <dig> large insertions and  <dig> large deletions identified in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison were identical . two examples were sr3_2lcp226_e <dig>  and sr3_firstas <dig>  . a second group had  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions, whose two terminals possessed repeated sequences in sr <dig> and jn <dig> . the flanking sequence of sr3_5v <dig>  harbors a run of g’s; the 3′ flanking sequence of sr3_firstas <dig>  includes two copies of catccc in jn <dig> but only one in sr <dig> . the repeat motifs present in the flanking sequence ranged in length from  <dig> to 51 nt . a 1 nt motif was present in  <dig> of the insertions and  <dig> of the deletions, dominated by runs of g . the third group, in which the flanking sequence was modified , is exemplified by sr3_firstas <dig> , where snps were generated at three positions adjacent to the deletion . a few of the unigenes experienced multiple indel events: sr3_firstas <dig> carries two deletions, one belonging to the first group and the other to the third group . other variants included the induction of translocated and chimeric sequences. in the homologs sr3_2lcp192_g <dig> and jn177_firstas <dig>  the same sequence was found in positions 1187– <dig> in the former allele, but at 1– <dig> in the other. sr3_2lcp192_g <dig> also harbors a large deletion with a repeat sequence caagaagga . sr3_firstas <dig> nucleotides 88– <dig> do not align with jn177_lcp139_d <dig> nucleotides 157– <dig>  but their terminal sequences are identical .fig.  <dig> hypothetical model for the formation of large indels induced during asymmetric somatic hybridization. blue block: unigenes shared by sr <dig> and jn <dig>  red block: insertion and deletion fragments. black block: repetitive sequences in the indel flanking sequence. gray blocks: small fragments adjacent to insertions and deletions, differing sequence between sr <dig> and jn <dig>  sr3-jn177: jn <dig> unigene sequences queried with those of sr <dig>  sr3-ta: sr <dig> unigene sequences queried with wheat ests housed in genbank. jn177-ta: jn <dig> unigene sequences queried with wheat ests housed in genbank



discussion
asymmetric somatic hybridization induces sequence variation
a manifestation of genomic shock, which has been experimentally observed in de novo wide hybrids and inferred from the analysis of natural allopolyploids  <cit> , is a widespread alteration of dna sequence in the form of both point mutations and indels . the alternation was found confirmed by the comparison between bread wheat and its ancestors  as well as between sr3/jn <dig> and sequences of wheat est database . the present comparison between the transcriptomes of sr <dig> and jn <dig> has shown that the somatic hybridization process also perturbs the genome in this way . aflp fingerprinting has also suggested that non-genic sequence also appear to suffer mutation  <cit> . cytogenetically and phenotypically, sr <dig>  has been shown to be highly stable  <cit> , which implies that genetic instability prevails only in the immediate aftermath of the wheat somatic hybridization event, at least in the short term.

the epigenetic modification of genic sequences is a common feature of allopolyploid genomes  <cit> . the proportion of loci experiencing an alteration in cytosine methylation in a newly synthesized allohexaploid wheat has been estimated to be as high as 13 %  <cit> . as methylated cytosines, especially those present as a cpg dinucleotide, are readily converted to thymine  <cit> , so - as demonstrated in arabidopsis thaliana - dna methylation can represent a major source of snp formation  <cit> . in plant genomes, the bias of synonymous codon usage towards thymine and adenine is also driven by dna methylation  <cit> . both somatic hybridization and allopolyploidization result in change in cytosine methylation  <cit> . we recently observed that the frequency of cytosine methylation changes in wheat genome exerted by somatic hybridization was  <dig>  % through the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism  analysis  <cit> , and was more intense than the frequency  exerted by allopolyploidization in a newly synthesized allohexaploid wheat  <cit> . this mechanism may therefore explain why c/t snps were more common in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison  than in the jn <dig> vs wheat database ests comparison . cytosine methylation polymorphisms are known to account for at least some of the differential gene transcription shown by sr <dig> and jn <dig>  <cit> ; a further contributor may well be chromatin remodeling. the frequency of snps  and indels  induced sr <dig> involved genes participating in chromatin assembly/disassembly and nucleosome assembly , consistent with the induction of widescale epigenetic changes resulting from somatic hybridization.

the evolutionary path followed by most polyploids is to reduce their genome size by deletion . after many generations of such activity, many of the sequences which have become duplicated as a result of the allopolyploidization event revert to single copy and the genome becomes increasingly diploid-like  <cit> . a good example of such a cryptic polyploid is maize  <cit> . some of the sequences lost in sr <dig>  were of substantial length , indicating that the response to somatic hybridization also includes sequence deletion. on the other hand, the preference to large insertion was alleviated in sr3-jn <dig> alignment, and the preference to either insertion or deletion was not correlative to indel size . consistently, aflp and southern blotting outcomes found that the extent of sequence loss over generations from the products of somatic hybridization was relatively modest  <cit> . these point to a potential difference in the way that genomes respond to polyploidization as opposed to somatic hybridization. a major difference is that a de novo sexual hybrid harbors the full genomes of the donor and recipient, while in the asymmetric somatic hybrid, only fragments of the donor are retained from the outset, and many are presumably eliminated prior to the regeneration from tissue culture. based on this, the suggestion is that the potential disruptive effect of donor dna is possibly much less.

asymmetric somatic hybridization was performed between uv-irradiated tall wheat grass protoplast and unirradiated wheat protoplast, both of which were produced from calli. during this process follows mutagenic factors including protoplast formation, uv irradiation, callus induction, and plant regeneration  <cit> . we found that these mutagenic factors had substantially slight effect on the genetic variation of sr <dig> and other other derivatives of wheat-based somatic hybrids by a set of molecular biomarker assays and comparing glutenin genomic sequences  <cit> . therefore, it could be concluded that the high frequency of genetic variation majorly comes from the genomic shock during asymmetric somatic hybridization.

putative mechanisms underlying indel formation induced by somatic hybridization
numerous indels differentiate the genomes of sr <dig> and jn <dig> . the gc content of the indels identified in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison was comparable to that in the indels differentiating the jn <dig> unigenes from those present in other wheat. as a result, it is not tenable to suggest that indels induced by the somatic hybridization process reflect a particular level of gc content. the proposition that indel formation, along with the other genomic changes induced by allopolyploidization, is non-random  <cit>  does however require that some feature of the local sequence acts as a recognition feature. the gc content of the nucleotide 5′ adjacent only to the indels differed from that of other nucleotides in flanking sequence , which does suggest that gc content could be a candidate signal for indel formation. note that the gc content of the sequences adjacent to indels differed between the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> and the jn <dig> vs database wheat ests comparisons , which implies that the mechanism underlying indel formation during somatic hybridization may well be distinct from that controlling the process in a sexual hybrid. repetitive sequences are particularly susceptible to expansion and contraction, and we found  <dig> indels in the sr <dig> vs jn <dig> comparison harbored repetitive sequences in their flanking sequence . repetitive sequences flanking indels may serve as recombination sites to promote indel formation via homologous recombination, because double strand breaks  appear to be common in regions enriched for repetitive sequences, and these “fragile sites” represent hotspots for recombination  <cit> .

the possible association between sequence variation and phenotype in sr3
the genetic variation was found to affect gene expression or the activity of gene production , therefore lead to phenotypic alteration. numerous transcriptomic and proteomic differences have been established between sr <dig> and jn <dig>  <cit> . here, it was revealed that a substantial number of unigenes  harbored snps and/or indels between sr <dig> and jn <dig> . especially, the high salt tolerance of sr <dig> is closely associated with its superior ability of antioxidation and redox homeostasis maintenance  <cit> , and here the unigenes participating in cell redox homeostasis and response to stress and oxidative stress also has higher snp and indel frequencies in sr <dig> . moreover, est sequences that absolutely matched to the probes of cdna array with differential expression profiles  <cit>  possessed some snps and indels, and some of these sequence variants could well contribute to the phenotypic difference between sr <dig> and jn <dig> . one established example is the gene tachp, which is more strongly transcribed in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> and is associated with sr3’s salinity tolerance  <cit> . the sr <dig> tachp allele differs from that present in jn <dig> by a deletion in its promoter sequence. a second example concerns tasro <dig>  also associated with the salinity tolerance of sr3; the sr <dig> and jn <dig> alleles differ by three snps, one of which is responsible for the higher activity of the sr <dig> allele  <cit> . the sequences of the sr <dig> and jn <dig> alleles of tafls <dig>  have been shown to be differentially methylated, and this polymorphism can account for their differential transcript abundance  <cit> . the headline conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that asymmetric somatic hybridization can induce a high frequency of both genetic and epigenetic variation, some of which is likely responsible for alterations in the phenotype.

during standard somatic hybridization, the genomes of biparents emerge together, which induces drastic genomic shock and therefore leads to large scale of genome rearrangement, sequence elimination and genetic variation  <cit> . as a result, the hybrids often exhibit development dysfunction and sterility  <cit> . for asymmetric somatic hybridization, the protoplasts of donor  are irradiated and its genome is fragmented, so in the fused cells of donor and recipient , most of chromatin fragments of donor are eliminated and a very few fragments are introgressed into the genome of recipient, while the genome of recipient has almost no structural change  <cit> . this event induces moderate genomic shock and results in bearable genetic variation. therefore, the hybrids are fertile and their wheat derivatives often exhibit diverse phenotypes such as high salt and drought tolerance, superior stripe rust resistance, as well as high quality and yield traits   <cit> , which can be selected to breed cultivar with improved agricultural traits.

methods
stress treatment and cdna library construction
given that sr <dig> has demonstrated improved levels of tolerance to both salinity and drought, we proposed to compare the sequence variation of ests that are produced under the control and after exposure to saline and osmotic stresses to gain the association between genetic variation and abiotic stress tolerance. three-leaf-stage seedlings of both cv. sr <dig> and cv. jn <dig> were exposed to half strength hoagland’s liquid medium containing either 200 mm nacl for  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 72 h, or to 18 % peg for  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 48 h. rna was extracted from both roots and leaves using the trizol reagent , and purified using an oligotextm-dt <dig> mrna purification kit . equimolar amounts of the various rna samples were mixed to obtain both an sr <dig> and a jn <dig> mrna pool, which formed the template for the construction of two cdna libraries using a cloneminer™ cdna library construction kit , according to the manufacturer’s protocol. given that the genetic variation induced by asymmetric somatic hybridization was remarkably higher than that induced by other mutagenic factors protoplast formation, uv radiation, callus induction and plant regeneration  <cit> , other cdna libraries reflecting the genetic variation of these mutagenic factors were not constructed.

cdna sequencing and sequence assembly
the two cdna libraries were cultured on lb agar plates containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin overnight at 37 °c. the monoclones were selected randomly, and the inserts present sequenced based on the m13f primer by the sanger sequencing method using abi  <dig> sequencer under the control of sequencing analysis  <dig> . <dig> with the default parameters. the cdnas were directionally inserted in the plastid, and the inserted sequences were sequenced from 5′-terminal using the m13f primer, which can increase the proportion of full-length cdna to be sequenced. to ensure the quality of sequences, only 800 nt fragments from the reading start were selected for following analysis. plastid and adapter sequences were removed to assume the sequencing quality of q <dig> using the seqman programme  <cit> . low quality and short  sequences were removed with egassemble . the quality of the cleaned sequences was further checked via randomly selecting more than  <dig> sequences to analyze sequencing peak graph. the edited sequences were assembled using cap <dig> software to produce a set of contigs and singletons   <cit> .

the resulting contig and singleton sequences were subjected to a blastn search, applying an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig> and an hsp length cut-off adjusted to  <dig>  to the est sequences of bread wheat, t. monococcum , ae. tauschii , t. turgidum  and ae. speltoides  mounted in genbank  . a blastx search of the non-redundant protein database  was used predict the full length cdna sequences, where the matched est sequence possessing encoding sequence of n-terminal amino acid  was defined as full length cdna. the sr <dig> and jn <dig> sequences were also subjected to a blastx search of the arabidopsis cdna database , applying an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig> and an hsp length cut-off adjusted to  <dig>  matching sequences were classified by gene ontology using the tair go annotation tool  and processed for go classification and pathway enrichment using blast2go  <cit>  using the entire go-annotated collection of sr <dig> and jn <dig> ests as the reference.

polymorphism calculation
the snp pattern was defined as the nucleotide of query sequence  with the nucleotide of subject sequence  as the reference . the insertion and deletion were also defined with the subject sequence as the reference. the sequences with blastn identity > 96 % were selected for calculation snp and indel frequencies to exclude the interference of paralogous genes as possible  <cit> , which were calculated as the ratio of total snp and indel amounts to the total length of matched regions of all ests with identity > 96 %, respectively. the matched coverage  was defined as the ratio of the total length of all matched regions of ests with identity >96 % to the total length of these ests. to analyze the possible association between genetic variation and transcriptional pattern, the sequences were subject to blastn against the sequences  of differentially expressed probes of wheat cdna array in our previous study exploring the transcriptomic difference between sr <dig> and jn <dig> seedlings under the control and after exposure to nacl and peg treatments  <cit> . the unigenes that absolutely matched probe sequences were selected for calculating snps and indels.

CONCLUSIONS
asymmetric somatic hybridization induces high frequency of point mutations and indels, with a stronger intense than the genetic variation during allopolyplodization, which is the molecular basis of the phenotypic alteration of somatic hybrids. moreover, the genetic variation induced by asymmetric somatic hybridization has different characteristics from those induced by allopolyplodization, demonstrating the specific genomic evolution in somatic hybrids. therefore, asymmetric somatic hybridization provides appropriate material to comprehensively explore the nature of the genetic variation induced by genomic shock.
