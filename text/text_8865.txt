BACKGROUND
aristotle was the first to record some animals give birth to live young  whilst others lay eggs   <cit> . viviparity may offer selective advantages to parents and offspring, such as enhanced survival of offspring, compensation for low fecundity, amplification of reproductive niches to reduce competition, exploitation of pelagic niches, colonisation of new habitats, and possibly increased energetic efficiency; disadvantages may include reduced fecundity, cost to the female, and risk of brood loss through maternal death  <cit> . viviparity is thought to have first evolved over  <dig> million years ago , and is an unprecedented example of convergent evolution having independently evolved at least  <dig> times in mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes  <cit> . among these viviparous organisms there are differences in the method of foetal nutrition, with the supply of nutrients via yolk in eggs or yolk-sacs considered to be ancestral  <cit> . in fact, yolk-sac placentation is the most common type of placentation in vertebrates  <cit> .

oviparity also has its own benefits given it has been retained by the majority of vertebrates. although viviparity has evolved many times, it creates post-fertilization opportunities for genomic conflicts absent in oviparous species  <cit> . furthermore, transitions in reproductive modes require numerous morphological, physiological, and behavioural adaptations. these can be associated with variation in geographic distribution and environmental conditions, as documented in reptiles  <cit>  and amphibians  <cit> .

sharks are considered the most enduring of fishes having survived the mass extinction events of the last  <dig> million years. approximately 70 % of these species give birth to live young and approximately 30 % lay eggs  <cit> . sharks are among the first vertebrates to display viviparity  <cit> . they are also members of a lineage which is a sister group to all teleosts and tetrapods, thereby ideally placed for comparative studies of these taxa. to date, however, there have been few studies of sharks at genome level ; one of the reasons for this is the large size of shark genomes   <cit>  in comparison to bony fish models .

during the early stages of development all viviparous sharks are nourished by a foetal yolk-sac  <cit> . viviparous sharks also display a diversity of embryonic nourishment derived from maternally obtained nutrients, known as matrotrophic nutrition. types of matrotrophic nutrition in sharks include mucus produced by the uterus , supply of unfertilised eggs , and direct exchange between maternal and foetal tissues via a placenta . placental connections develop in sharks when the empty yolk-sac morphs and attaches to the uterus wall  <cit> . in viviparous shark species that do not develop placental connections , the empty yolk-sac is reabsorbed into the developing embryo  <cit> .

placenta are thought to have one evolutionary origin in sharks and are restricted to five families from the carcharhiniformes order   <cit> . two of these families, carcharhinidae and triakidae, contain both placental and non-placental species, with the lack of placenta thought to be due to secondary loss  <cit> . additional nutrition via a placenta is suggested to increase the embryonic development rate of energetically expensive tissues such as the brain, and there is evidence associating increased reproductive nutrition in sharks with larger brain sizes, relative to body mass  <cit> .

here we focused on one shark family, the carcharhinids , which all display placental viviparity, apart from the tiger shark   <cit> . as the sister groups to galeocerdo are placental, it is most likely this lineage has undergone placental loss. recent research has identified distinct embryonic nutrition displayed by tiger sharks where the egg case housing the embryo becomes filled with approximately one litre of energy-rich, yellowish fluid  <cit> .

in this study, we reconstructed a phylogenetic relationship for the tiger shark, six other carcharhinid sharks, and two outgroup species. we used fossil data to produce a time-calibrated phylogeny to estimate when the tiger shark lineage diverged from the placental carcharhinids. we also aimed to identify orthologous genes among the transcriptomes of the nine species and determine if there is evidence of genes evolving under positive selection, and possibly associated with the loss of placenta in the tiger shark lineage. based on the proposed link between embryonic nutrition and brain size, we hypothesised to detect in the tiger shark lineage evidence of positive selection in genes encoding proteins associated with brain development, as well as sexual reproduction.

RESULTS
sequencing
we sequenced the transcriptomes of six placental carcharhinids and the non-placental tiger shark. we also sequenced the transcriptomes of two additional shark species to serve as outgroups: the placental viviparous dusky smoothhound   and another species that does not develop a placenta, the sand tiger shark   . after quality control, illumina sequencing of the white muscle transcriptomes of the nine species produced over  <dig> million filtered paired-end 100-base pair  reads .table  <dig> transcriptome statistics for the nine viviparous shark species sampled here



transcriptome assembly and orthologue identification
we used trinity  to assemble species specific transcriptomes  <cit> . the mean number of transcripts was  <dig>   and the mean n <dig> value was  <dig> . we then identified from the open reading frames  of assembled transcripts  <dig>  putative orthologous sequences using a reciprocal best-hit blast search. high confidence alignments were generated for these orthologous sequences using multiple aligners. alignments were subsequently filtered again to remove low confidence codon alignments, finally resulting in  <dig>  orthologues for further analysis.

phylogenetic tree construction and positive selection analyses
the  <dig>  orthologue alignments were concatenated  and used to construct a phylogenetic tree  using raxml   <cit> . the  <dig>  orthologues were then analysed with codeml, a program of paml   <cit> . the codeml one ratio model  found no orthologue exhibiting signatures of positive selection across the entire sequence. therefore, we used an additional test, a comparison between the neutral model  <dig>  and the non-neutral model  <dig>  to identify specific regions of genes that may be evolving under positive selection. sequences with significant m8:m <dig> likelihood ratios provide evidence of positive selection; therefore these sequences were further analysed using the bayes empirical bayes  method to identify specific codons which may be under positive selection  <cit> . of the  <dig>  orthologues across nine species analysed by codeml and beb,  <dig> orthologues  were found to have specific codon sites showing signatures of positive selection .

another phylogenetic tree was reconstructed, but this time only using orthologues not evolving under positive selection . using this second tree, and re-mapping all orthologues onto the tree, signatures of positive selection were identified at specific codon sites within five genes  of the non-placental tiger shark lineage using the branch-site test and beb method . two of these genes are associated with sexual reproduction  and two are associated with brain development . for nars <dig>  we could not find sufficient information that could link positive selection in this gene to the loss of placental viviparity.fig.  <dig> time-calibrated phylogenetic tree of sharks. based on analyses of  <dig>  genes . species are named along with the orders and families they belong to the non-placental species are shown in red. each node was annotated with inferred posterior mean times and 95 % highest posterior density credibility intervals in million years. node 1:  <dig> and 170– <dig>  node 2:  <dig> and 130– <dig>  node 3:  <dig> and 59– <dig>  node 4:  <dig> and 35– <dig>  node 5:  <dig> and 20– <dig>  node 6:  <dig> and 15– <dig>  node 7:  <dig> and 11– <dig>  node 8:  <dig> and 10– <dig>  each node is supported with a bootstrap value of 100 %

discussion
phylogenetic relationships
using  <dig> ,817 bp of transcriptome data per species we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships for the species sampled. we included the dusky smoothhound and sand tiger shark as outgroups; the placental dusky smoothhound belongs to the only other shark family with both placental and non-placental species , whereas the sand tiger shark is one of many non-placental species making up a sister order to the carcharhiniformes. the carcharhiniformes and lamniformes appear to have diverged before the evolution of placenta in sharks.

the resulting phylogenetic relationships are largely consistent with others recently published  <cit> , except for placement of the caribbean reef shark. in the sorenson et al.  <cit>  phylogenetic tree the caribbean reef shark is positioned as a sister group to a clade including the bull and blacknose sharks, with the blue shark as an outgroup to the three species. in our phylogenetic trees, the blacknose and bull sharks are grouped into one clade and the blue and caribbean reef sharks are grouped into another clade . we believe our topology is more robust given the larger number of characters used , although here with a limited taxon sampling. we estimated the tiger shark lineage diverged from the placental carcharhinids approximately  <dig> mya ), whereas the estimate of sorenson et al.  <cit>  was  <dig> mya  . it should be noted, however, that sorenson et al. employed a much denser taxonomic sampling  that contributed to shorter branch lengths, smaller hpd cis, and also allowed for additional fossil calibrations. the relatively old ages of our outgroups and the long branch lengths at the base of our phylogenetic trees likely contribute to the larger hpd ci for the divergence of the tiger shark and placental carcharhinid lineages compared to sorenson et al. in addition, cartilaginous skeletons contribute to the paucity of shark fossils and consequently teeth are one of the most abundant shark fossil types  <cit> . identifying species based on fossilised teeth is more difficult than identifying based on complete fossils as sharks exhibit diversity in dental morphology across sexes, life history stages, and even positions within the jaw  <cit> . thus there is a level of uncertainty associated with the fossil data used to calibrate the phylogeny.table  <dig> inferred divergence times for the carcharhinidae – galeocerdo node in shark phylogenetic trees. mean age and 95 % highest posterior density credibility intervals  are provided for this study and sorenson et al.  <cit>

genes evolving under positive selection in the tiger shark
positive selection on genes linked to sexual reproduction
tiger sharks have a gestation period of approximately 15- <dig> months, several months longer than many placental carcharhinids, and follow a triennial reproductive cycle, with an estimated one year of sexual inactivity  <cit> . as male tiger sharks generally reproduce annually, changes to female reproductive behaviour may have led to an increase in sperm competition and post-copulatory sexual selection.

here, we detected the signature of positive selection in the tctex1d <dig> and vamp <dig> genes. tctex1d <dig> encodes a dynein- <dig> light chain protein required for cilia function and found in the flagellum of sperm in a variety of taxa, including humans, mice, teleosts and sea urchins . sperm motility is reduced and spermatogenesis disrupted in mice lacking tctex1d <dig> as a result of increased apoptosis in male germ cells  <cit> . deletion of vamp <dig> causes a significant increase in sperm head abnormalities in mice, resulting from aberrant acrosome formation  <cit> . this has implications for sperm morphology and hydrodynamics, therefore positive selection in tctex1d <dig> and vamp <dig> may alter sperm count and motility, which could be a response to changes in sperm competition in tiger sharks induced by the loss of placenta.

it is assumed when there is strong sperm competition an individual can gain a competitive advantage by increasing sperm production  <cit> ; however, there is a trade-off between sperm size and number  <cit> . sharks display extensive variation in sperm morphology which is thought to demonstrate variation in the intensity of post-copulatory sexual selection . tanaka et al.  <cit>  showed tiger sharks have the shortest sperm flagella length and total length of  <dig> sharks across seven orders. therefore, evidence of positive selection in tctex1d <dig> and vamp <dig> in tiger sharks could reflect the evolution of an increased sperm count and shorter sperm in response to increased sperm competition and post-copulatory sexual selection.

positive selection on genes linked to brain development
signatures of positive selection were detected in arl6ip <dig>  a transmembrane protein inhibiting eaac <dig>  the latter being a transporter of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate  <cit> . eaac <dig> is associated with neuron development in both vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . when deprived of oxygen, levels of glutamate in neurons increase, causing neuronal death and potentially brain damage  <cit> . therefore, the ability to maintain glutamate levels below damaging thresholds may have enabled the exploitation of marginal habitats. penetrating marginal habitats could be advantageous for these predators by allowing expansion into sub-optimal habitats where prey may take refuge  <cit> . contemporary evidence for this is demonstrated by the near-global distribution of tiger sharks in coastal and pelagic habitats around the world, as well as their diverse diet  <cit> . tiger sharks also spend considerable time in shallow seagrass and neritic habitats  <cit> , where dissolved oxygen concentrations fluctuate diurnally due to high productivity and demand  <cit> .

the brain is one of the most energetically expensive organs to develop and maintain, and non-placental sharks are proposed to generally have smaller brains relative to body mass, compared to placental species  <cit> . animals need to maintain a balance between maintenance of the brain and other organs when exposed to hypoxic conditions  <cit> . there is evidence of intra and interspecific variation in brain size of fishes exposed to different concentrations of dissolved oxygen, with larger brains evident in species inhabiting well-oxygenated waters .

signatures of positive selection were also detected in ywhae, a member of the 14-3- <dig> protein family  <cit> . these proteins are expressed ubiquitously, particularly in the brain, and are highly conserved across animals  <cit> . the 14-3- <dig> proteins are vital for differentiation of neurons in drosophila, while mice lacking ywhae have restricted brain development and neuronal migration  <cit> . in humans, ywhae is absent in sufferers of miller-dieker syndrome, which is characterised by severe mental disability  <cit> . this suggests ywhae is vital for brain development in humans and other animals. positive selection in ywhae could thus reflect a reduction in brain size in response to hypoxia experienced in sub-optimal habitats occupied by tiger sharks.

positive selection in the tctex1d <dig>  vamp <dig>  arl6ip <dig>  and ywhae genes and their functional associations suggest they may have played a role in adaptation following the loss of placenta in tiger sharks. noteworthy, changes in gene expression could have also been involved; however, as the time since species divergence increases, so do gene expression differences  <cit> . given the tiger shark and placental carcharhinids diverged c.  <dig> mya, the magnitude of gene expression changes is considerable, likely erasing any potential signal of gene expression changes associated with the loss of placenta. furthermore, controlling the variety of factors  potentially influencing gene expression would require a completely different sampling design to the one we employ here. investigations of gene expression would also require uterus or yolk-sac tissue which are difficult to sample in a non-lethal way; hence, we sampled white muscle tissue instead. furthermore, positive selection is intermittent in nature and signatures of it can be lost over time due to recombination and accumulating neutral substitutions  <cit> , thus some signatures of positive selection in other genes may no longer be detectable.

previous studies have shown positive selection can act strongly on genes that greatly affect an individual’s fitness   <cit> . thus, there could be additional factors explaining the signatures of positive selection exhibited in these four genes in the tiger shark lineage. we have here only one point of comparison, these genes might affect other traits of the tiger shark and may not be linked simply to the loss of placenta. their functional associations, however, suggest these genes are good candidates for further study using additional genomic techniques.

other studies have used genomics to test for signatures of positive selection associated with placental evolution in mammals  <cit> . evidence of positive selection in this group was found across  <dig>  genes by crosley et al.  and in approximately  <dig> genes by elliot & crespi . signatures of positive selection were detected in a greater number of genes in these studies compared with our study; however, both crosley et al. and elliot & crespi used a larger set of closely related species, and therefore looked at more genes than us, i.e.  <dig>  genes in elliot & crespi  and approximately  <dig>  genes in crosley et al.  versus  <dig>  genes here. in addition, crosley et al. and elliot & crespi tested for positive selection along multiple lineages, whereas we tested for positive selection along the tiger shark lineage only. interestingly, signatures of positive selection were also detected in genes associated with brain development and sexual reproduction in elliot & crespi and crosley et al., respectively  <cit> , suggesting similar adaptations associated with placentation may have occurred in both mammals and sharks.

we were limited in the outgroups we could sample. we included as an outgroup one placental species  from the other shark family  in which species may have also lost placenta. unfortunately, we could not obtain samples from non-placental houndshark species, and so could not compare signatures of positive selection in genes along two independent lineages where placenta may have been lost. also, we were unable to sample additional carcharhiniform species, but had lamniforms instead . we identified more orthologous genes in the sand tiger transcriptome compared with other potential outgroup species, and so we used it as the second outgroup taxon.

finally, another caveat of our study is the sampling of a single individual for each species during a short time frame. consequently, the sequence data for each species lack individual, gender, ontogenetic, and temporal variation.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest the tiger shark lineage split from the placental carcharhinids approximately  <dig> mya. we also propose at least four genes associated with brain development and sperm production have been evolving under positive selection in the tiger shark lineage, potentially reflecting adaptation following placental loss. future work should utilise supplementary genomic techniques to investigate similar changes in reproductive traits of additional shark species.
