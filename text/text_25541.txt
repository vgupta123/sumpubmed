BACKGROUND
gene-expression microarrays are widely used for large scale studies in cells, and are emerging as promising tools in clinical diagnosis, with potential impact on the assessment of prognosis and choice of treatment  <cit> . microarray data are also increasingly becoming essential for data driven model building in system biology approaches  <cit> . however, the measurement of gene expression using e.g. cdna microarray technology is a complex process that involves several steps, which have not yet been fully optimized. in a typical cdna microarray experiment, total rna from two biological sources in which gene expression levels are to be compared, is labelled with two different fluorescent dyes and hybridized to an array of spotted cdna probes. after hybridization and scanning the data are further pre-processed. this often includes image analysis, filtering of data and background subtraction before normalization and transformation of data. relative gene expression levels are given as ratios of intensities of fluorescent emission from labelled the rnas'. many different approaches and methods can be used at each stage of a microarray experiment, and there is still no definitive consensus about which methods to choose .

sample quality, labeling protocol, hybridization conditions, scanning protocols and image acquisition as well as the different stages in the microarray data analysis pipeline can all contribute to the overall uncertainty of the conclusions drawn. there has therefore recently been an emerging focus on the need for universally applicable standards, reference materials and analytic guidelines to assist in the standardization of microarray experiments  <cit> . in order to choose or optimize microarray methods several criteria can be used. the use of external rna spike-in controls is the most recommended approach for technology assessment and optimization. however, the recommended use of spike-in rna might not always be feasible. for optimal application several controls and probes must be used and the spike-in controls must be representative of the endogenous rna with respect to e.g. length, sequence characteristics, melting temperature and cross-hybridization risk  <cit> . on some arrays suitable spike-in controls are not printed, and printing a sufficient number of spikes can leave insufficient room for the genes of biological interest. other valuable tools are calibrated reference rna samples such as those developed in the maqc project  <cit>  or mixed tissue rna samples developed by thompson et al.  <cit> . however, it is not always possible to have rna samples with known differences in the expression level of many genes from the species of interest.

one general strategy that can be used is to minimize the variability of self-self hybridizations  <cit> . unfortunately, this criterion focuses on the zero ratios that are the least interesting biologically and will tend to minimize variability  as well as signal, which may not improve the overall ability to detect differentially expressed genes. one major concern is that the optimization criterion should increase the chances of discovering truly differentially expressed genes. here we propose an optimization method that requires only four microarrays per evaluation and uses both hybridizations of rna from samples with marked differences in gene expression, termed "high contrasts" as well as self-self hybridizations. a change in either laboratory procedure or data processing can increase real signal or just increase the noise. if the noise is increased this will also affect the self-self hybridizations. on the other hand, if signal is lost and genes are pushed artificially towards zero ratios, this will shrink ratios in the high contrast experiments. in the high contrast versus self-self method  proposed here we maximize the difference between a self-self and a high contrast experiment. this difference is quantified as the number of significantly differentially expressed genes in the high contrast experiment at a certain false discovery rate  estimated using the self-self experiments as a null distribution. genes are scored for differential expression on the basis of the high contrast and the self-self hybridization separately using a modified t- statistic  <cit> .

applications
there is a large number of steps in the microarray production, hybridization, scanning and data analysis that have adjustable parameters that may be optimized. we will show how hcssm can be used to optimize data analysis and hybridization protocols. as mentioned above, the standard microarray data analysis pipeline consists of image analysis, filtering of data, background correction, normalization and identification of differentially expressed genes. recent studies have focused on the normalization step and evaluated a large number of normalization methods for cdna microarray data  <cit> . we have therefore chosen to test the hcssm on filtering and background correction, as these are fields where there is still considerable debate in the literature  <cit> .

effects of level of filtration on the number of differentially expressed genes
it is common in microarray analysis to reduce the impact of spots that are malformed or have intensities outside the linear range of the scanner. such spots are either removed, or weighted down using some measure of spot quality. filtering has been shown to introduce bias in microarray studies  <cit> , but has also been shown to significantly reduce variation in self-self hybridizations  <cit> . however, as far as we know, no work has shown how the bias versus variance trade-off in practice influences the ability to detect differentially expressed genes. therefore, we tested a number of different filtering methods of increasing complexity to evaluate how they influence the ability to find differentially expressed genes in a study.

often filtering consists of removing spots with intensities below a  threshold  <cit> . we have however found no investigations into the effect of such filtering. several filtering methods based on spot quality statistics have been reported  <cit> . these quality measures can be used as filters by setting a spot quality threshold, but can also be used as weights to reduce the impact of low quality spots.

we propose a simple quality measure using the variability information available from most image analysis software. the variation in a log ratio  can be approximated from the variation in the pixel intensities using equation   <cit>

the delta term is a small number added to stabilize spots with very small uncertainties.

effects of background correction on the number of differentially expressed genes
the rationale of background correction is that the e.g. observed green signal intensity  is a linear combination of a true signal coming from the labelled rna  and a background signal  so that:

 g = gt + g b 

more accurate log ratios can then be obtained by correcting the observed signal by subtracting the background. the problem then is to correctly estimate the background signal for each spot in the image analysis phase, and correcting this estimate to satisfy prior criteria e.g. background smoothness and non-negativity of the true signal. background correction in itself may also destabilize results by increasing variance  <cit> , and may decrease the ability to detect differentially expressed genes. therefore, we use the hcssm to compare the ability to find differentially expressed genes when no background correction is used versus a non negative background correction method  <cit> .

effect of choice and dose of dt blockers in cdna microarray experiments
the hcss-method can be applied to the laboratory procedures as well as to the data processing steps in microarray research. one major source of bias in cdna microarrays is cross-hybridization of the labelled rna to non-target homologous probe sequences on the array  <cit> . a substantial proportion of the non-specific cross-hybridization signal is due to poly-poly cross hybridization since poly-containing molecules produced during labelling of poly tails of sample rnas by reverse transcription can bind promiscuously to the poly stretch of cdna probe spots. these poly hybridization signals reduce the ability to detect differentially expressed genes. thus, minimization of poly hybridization is a major challenge in cdna microarray experiments. to reduce the poly signals it is common practice to add a blocker like synthetic poly in the probe or poly in the hybridization mixture  <cit> . recently, an lna dt blocker containing locked nucleic acid  nucleotides  <cit>  has been introduced. there is currently no standardized protocol available that can be used to evaluate and optimize blocking procedures with respect to optimizing the observed number of differentially expressed genes. in the present study we therefore compared the effect of poly40– <dig> and different doses of lna dt blocker on the number of differentially expressed genes, and used the hcssm to optimize identification of truly differentially expressed genes.

RESULTS
the choice and dose of blocking reagent influences the number of differentially expressed genes estimated
in order to evaluate how different conditions designed to block poly-poly cross hybridization affect the ability to detect differentially expressed genes, we applied the hcss-method to analysis of microarray experiments performed in the presence of either poly40– <dig> or varying amounts of lna. poly40– <dig> binds to the poly segment of the labelled target in the hybridization solution and thus competes with the poly segment in the microarray cdna probes. lna dt blocker contains locked nucleic acid  nucleotides  <cit>  at key positions within the  synthetic strand, and is designed to block poly  sequences present in the microarray cdna probes and prevent them from hybridizing to poly segment of the labelled targets.

six different blocking conditions with dye-swap and self versus self were investigated in a total of  <dig> hybridizations . significantly differentially expressed genes were determined by estimating the false discovery rate using a null distribution obtained from the self-self experiments, as described in the background section. filtration was performed as described below and in the methods section. our results clearly demonstrate the effect of blocking the poly segment of the labelled target since addition of poly40– <dig> increased the number of estimated differentially expressed genes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the lna dt blocker further increased the number of estimated differentially expressed genes in a dose dependent manner with a maximum of  <dig> differentially expressed genes estimated in the presence of  <dig> ng lna . in general, more than five biological experiments are recommended for detecting differentially expressed genes in microarry experiments  <cit> . technical replicates are mainly recommended in quality-control studies. we would like to emphasize that even our hcss-method only requires four microarrays per evaluation; more experiments are needed to accurately determine whether the spike in differentially expressed genes for the  <dig> ng lna polya is a real optimum or noise in the dose response curve. it is also important to notice that the optimal dose and choice of blocker may vary for different arrays and microarray protocols. however, our results indicate that the concept of using self-self and high contrast hybridizations in control experiments is well suited to identify optimal blocking conditions.

background correction method has a stronger impact on the estimated number of differentially expressed genes than filtering
the data from the blocking study were also analysed using combinations of filter methods and background correction . we tested the following five different filtering methods of increasing complexity: coarse, medium, fine, uncertain and weighting filter. filters were based on spot foreground intensity, percentage of pixels saturated and ratio uncertainties as described in the methods section. in addition we applied three different background corrections: none were only foreground signal is used to calculate ratios, edwards which is a subtraction method that ensures positive values  <cit>  and dampened edwards were a small number is added to the corrected signal to avoid extreme ratios in those cases where the background corrected intensities would be very low. weight based filtering; using the ratio uncertainty to reduce the impact of "bad" spots without removing them completely found the highest numbers of differentially expressed genes regardless of background correction method and blocking agent dose . the choice of background correction method had a higher impact on the number of differentially expressed genes than filtering. no background correction resulted in the highest amount of differentially expressed genes estimated, the numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> under the five different filtering methods and blocking with  <dig> ng lna . edwards and dampened edwards gave 66– <dig> and 191– <dig> differentially expressed genes, respectively, under the same filtering conditions. our results strongly indicate that omission of background correction consistently improves the results. the reason may be that background correction introduces a lot of variability to remove a small bias. as long as the red and green backgrounds are highly correlated they will dampen the ratios, but only significantly for the low intensity spots, for which the ratios are uncertain anyway. one strategy may be to use error propagation to evaluate background correction, and only background correct the spots where the bias is large, thus not increasing the variance of all spots, but still removing the bias for some of the worst affected spots.

validation of cdna microarray data generated by hcssm
in our experiments a dose of  <dig> ng lna dt blocker gave the highest number of differentially expressed genes. when hcssm was further used to evaluate steps in the computational analysis of microarray data we found that no background correction and weight based filtering estimated  <dig> differentially expressed genes  compared to  <dig> when the data was analysed by dampened edwards background correction and weight based filtering . thus, omission of background correction added ~ <dig> unique genes to the list of genes identified as differentially expressed. only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes identified with dampened edwards background correction and weight based filtering were not detected when no background correction was performed .

in order to investigate the level of concordance of biological themes represented in the gene lists a and b, we used genetools, an "all in one" annotation web tool package  <cit>  recently described by beisvag et al,  <dig>  <cit> . the two gene lists  were submitted to egon , which automatically associates gene ontology  terms from public databases to the submitted gene list. we found that the main go terms were represented in both gene list a and gene list b. furthermore, the proportion  associated with specific go terms was similar for all terms, as illustrated for selected go terms in table  <dig>  the average proportion for all go terms associated with five or more genes was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , n =  <dig> . this indicated that the increase in differently expressed genes estimated by hcssm was not random. we than applied cross platform analysis to validate that the  <dig> genes added to the gene list was real.

a: gene list generated with no background correction and weight based filtering. b: gene list generated with dampened edwards background correction and weight based filtering. aub: number of genes differentially expressed in both gene list a and b. aÚb: number of genes differentially expressed in gene list a but not in gene list b. bÚa: number of genes differentially expressed in gene list b but not in gene list a. proportion: number of genes in a/number of genes in b. the genes were annotated using genetools  <cit>  according to unigen build # <dig>  all go categories associated with more than five genes are shown in additional file  <dig> 

cross platform microarray analysis
the combined use of multiple microarray platforms has recently been suggested as an alternative that is complementary to qrt-pcr for validation of gene expression profiles  <cit> . in an attempt to validate a large fraction of the cdna microarray results we used the illumina gene expression system  for cross-platform analysis of differentially expressed genes in ar42j cells versus nrk52e cells. the same sources of total rna used in the cdna microarray experiments were hybridized to illumina's sentrix® ratref- <dig> expression beadchips, with six technical replicates for each cell line as described in the methods section. only genes common to both platforms were included in the analysis. of the  <dig> additional genes identified with no background correction,  <dig> genes were represented on both the spotted cdna arrays and the illumina ratref- <dig> expression beadchips. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were identified as differentially expressed in the same direction  on both platforms . the overlaps of differentially expressed genes across commercially microarray platforms are recently reported to be~80– <dig> %  <cit> .

since rt-pcr is still considered the "golden standard" for gene expression measurements, we further used sybr green-based quantitative real-time pcr to validate the relative gene expression for a few of the  <dig> additional genes identified with optimal conditions. commonly, a  <dig> fold change is reported as the cut-off below which microarray and qrt-pcr data begin to loose correlation, although recent reports observed significant correlation where genes exhibited  <dig>  fold change or higher  <cit> . we therefore selected seven genes in the fold ratio range  <dig>  to  <dig>  . results are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  description of pcr primers and qrt-pcr protocol are shown in additional file  <dig>  five of the selected genes  were detected as differentially expressed on both microarray platforms. two genes  were only identified on the the cdna platform. five genes with fold ratio >  <dig> were verified by qrt-pcr . two genes  with fold ratio <  <dig> were not verified. hox2b was excluded from the results due to technical problems . the gene ube2b was expressed in the opposite direction relative to the cdna microarray, but in the same direction as on the illumina platform . consistent with other reports  <cit> , the microarray ratios were compressed compared to qrt-pcr results . overall, the qrt-pcr measurement corresponded  <dig> %  with the illumina data and  <dig> %  with the cdna microarray data. the latter confirmation rate is in accordance with cdna microarray results of others .

some of the discrepancy between cdna microarry versus illumina and qrt-pcr may be due to errors  in the image collection used for probes in our cdna microarrays. we thus consider the results from qrt-pcr and the illumina platform more likely to be "true data" in the present study. in spite of the known errors on cdna platforms, cross platform analysis confirmed  <dig> % of the results. validation of a few selected genes by qrt-pcr supported this finding. taken together, functional annotation analysis and the alternative methods for validation of the cdna micoarry data indicated that the increase in the number of differentially expressed genes found by hcssm was mainly real.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we have used the hcssm in cdna microarray control experiments to evaluate blocking conditions, filtration and background correction. we found that the choice and dose of poly-poly blocking agents during hybridization influenced the estimated number of differentially expressed genes. when hcssm was used to evaluate steps in the computational analysis of microarray data we found that no background correction and weight based filtering gave the largest estimated numbers of differentially expressed genes. the background correction method, however, has a stronger impact on the numbers of differentially expressed genes found than filtering. the results show that hcssm may be a useful and simple approach to optimize cdna microarrays procedures without including external standards.
