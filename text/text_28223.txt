BACKGROUND
the nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium neorhizobium galegae has an easily distinguishable phenotype on the host plant species galega orientalis lam. and g. officinalis l. it is the only rhizobial species known to induce root nodules on galega plants so far, making studies of its genomics an attractive area in the field of research on determinants of host specificity and nitrogen fixation efficiency. although research on nitrogen fixation with n. galegae has been conducted since the description of the new species in  <dig>  <cit> , the mechanism behind the specific interactions between galega plants and their microsymbiont is still not well understood. the division of n. galegae strains into two symbiovars  <cit>  with different phenotypes on the two host plant species brings further challenge into the study of this bacterium. work has been done on the rhizobial signalling molecules, the nod factors, of n. galegae  <cit> , and the function of the rare acetyl substitution has been investigated. however, a clear explanation for the host specificity observed on galega has not been found within the nod factors. it is obvious that more information is needed both on characteristics distinguishing n. galegae from other rhizobial species but also strains within the species having different symbiotic phenotypes, as well as on characteristics of the host plant that may act to discriminate between strains of the same bacterial species.

the complete genomes of two strains of n. galegae were recently sequenced to shed some light on the basic genomic features separating n. galegae from other rhizobia and its symbiovars from each other  <cit> . the complete genome sequences of these strains, the type strain hambi 540t representing symbiovar  orientalis and strain hambi  <dig> representing sv. officinalis, are invaluable to this research but not enough to observe genomic patterns related to the bacterial species or its symbiovars. therefore, we have produced draft genomes of eight additional strains of n. galegae, four strains each of the symbiovars orientalis and officinalis, which combined with the previously sequenced complete genomes make a good representation of the n. galegae population. these data also enable a deeper study of the genomic patterns separating the two symbiovars as well as strains showing different nitrogen-fixing capacities, than was previously possible. in this study, data from the eight newly sequenced strains were combined with the whole-genome data of strains hambi 540t and hambi  <dig>  and analysed to produce information on genomic characteristics of the species n. galegae. analysis of subgroups within the species, defined by the symbiotic phenotypes observed on galega plants, together with experimental evidence revealed that the sv. orientalis-specific rpon <dig> gene as well as the nifq gene are necessary for nitrogen fixation. genes possibly related to enhanced plant growth promoting capabilities are also discussed.

RESULTS
symbiosis gene regions are well conserved within the symbiovars
draft genomes of eight strains of n. galegae were produced, generating genomes consisting of between  <dig> and  <dig> contigs. the total size of the sequenced genome is between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp for all strains , comprising two to four replicons per strain, as predicted by the number of repabc operons and preliminary assembly of contigs. the eight new genomes were analysed together with the previously sequenced strains hambi 540t and hambi  <dig>  <cit> , to produce new information on the genomic differences separating strains of the two symbiovars.table  <dig>

athe contig containing the rrna operon always contains three trna genes. since this contig is always present in three copies in each genome, so are the trnas contained within this contig, adding six trnas to the total number of trnas encountered in the genome, making a total of  <dig> to  <dig> trnas identified per genome.



upon analysis of the nod, noe, nif and fix genes found in the gene regions corresponding to the symbiosis gene regions of hambi 540t and hambi  <dig>  <cit> , the gene content was found consistent with regard to the symbiovar . the same nod, noe, nif and fix genes can be found in all strains. the four sv. orientalis strains all share the nod, nif and fix gene structure found in strain hambi 540t, with one exception: a predicted transposase gene located between the gene for the t1ss hlyd family protein and nodn in strain hambi  <dig>  beside this minor difference, the symbiosis gene region only differs between strains in the genes separating the node – nodj cluster from the fixu – nifh gene cluster, as well as the genes separating nifh from nodu and nodu from the nodd <dig> – noet gene cluster.figure  <dig> schematic representation of gene regions containing known symbiosis genes of strains sequenced in this study. strains hambi 540t and hambi  <dig> are reference strains for which the complete genomes were sequenced previously  <cit> . a) symbiovar orientalis strains. the genes pa <dig> and pa <dig> are t1ss genes. b) symbiovar officinalis strains. the genes pb <dig> and pb <dig> are t1ss genes.



the analysed sv. officinalis strains have two main symbiosis gene region structures. based on preliminary assembly of the contigs included in this region, strains hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig> had an almost identical gene content and gene arrangement , the only difference between the two being a predicted hypothetical protein located in between fdxb and fixa in hambi  <dig>  the symbiosis gene region of these two strains is also very similar to that found in strain hambi  <dig> . on the other hand, strains hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig> seem to have identical symbiosis gene regions, while differing from strains hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig> to some extent. the structure of the main gene clusters is the same, but the genes separating these nod, nif and fix gene clusters differ from those in the latter two strains both in the number of genes present and the predicted function of the same.

the rpon <dig> gene is specific to sv. orientalis strains
in addition to the nod, noe, nif and fix genes, all sv. orientalis strains have a hypothetical protein gene followed by an rpon gene copy included in the symbiosis gene region, similar to the situation in strain hambi 540t. none of the analysed sv. officinalis strains have these genes. the presence of a second rpon gene in the symbiosis gene region was also confirmed a common characteristic of sv. orientalis strains when a set of nine n. galegae sv. orientalis strains  were screened for this gene by pcr. the rpon <dig> protein sequences of all five sequenced n. galegae sv. orientalis strains were 100% identical. on the other hand, there were some differences in the rpon <dig> sequences of the eight strains where the complete rpon <dig> sequence was available . all eight rpon <dig> sequences were between  <dig>  and  <dig> % identical, while the maximum sequence identity of rpon <dig> to any of the rpon <dig> sequences was  <dig> %.

a gene replacement deletion mutant of the rpon <dig> gene was constructed in hambi 540t to test the impact on symbiosis. location of the insert and intactness of other parts of the genome of the mutant was verified by genome sequencing and mapping to the reference genome of hambi 540t. upon inoculation of g. orientalis plants with the mutant strain , nodules were formed but the inoculated plants showed growth comparable to that observed when inoculated with the ineffective sv. officinalis strain hambi  <dig>  plants remained short and the leaves were very pale green, indicating that nitrogen fixation was impaired and that this copy of rpon is required for functional symbiosis on g. orientalis.

the nifq gene is divergent but functional
another gene located in the symbiosis gene region that makes a clear distinction between strains of the two symbiovars is the nifq gene. alignment of the protein sequences deduced from this gene showed that the nifq protein is well conserved within the symbiovars, while there was a remarkable amount of substitutions when sequences were compared between symbiovars . in addition, the nifq sequences in n. galegae were highly divergent from those of the model species azotobacter vinelandii and klebsiella pneumoniae . the nifq sequences of all five sv. orientalis strains were 100% identical, while some minor differences in predicted start codon and location of the stop codon could be observed between strains of sv. officinalis.figure  <dig> alignment of nifq seuquences. the nifq protein sequences of the ten sequenced n. galegae strains were aligned to those of the model system species a. vinelandii and k. pneumoniae, and the rhizobial relatives sinorhizobium fredii and rhizobium tropici. the last two amino acid residues of s. fredii are not visible in the figure. bottom line: amino acid residues that are conserved in all n. galegae strains are indicated with “^”, residues conserved in all included rhizobial strains with “!” and residues conserved in all strains in the alignment are indicated with “#”. the molybdenum-binding motif region , indicated with a yellow box, has not been preserved in n. galegae.



gene replacement deletion mutants were constructed also for nifq in both hambi 540t and hambi  <dig>  and the mutant strains  verified by genome sequencing and mapping to the respective reference strains. the mutant strains were tested on their respective host plants, generating results similar to those observed with the rpon <dig> mutant. plants were short and pale, clearly suffering from nitrogen deprivation, comparable to the outcome when g. orientalis is inoculated with sv. officinalis strain hambi  <dig> and g. officinalis inoculated with sv. orientalis strain hambi 540t. the nodules formed were small and white on g. officinalis, while nodules on g. orientalis were more pale pink or greenish, but still much more pale and smaller than effective nodules formed by wild-type hambi 540t. unfortunately, attempts to express the nifq gene of hambi  <dig> in hambi 540t and vice versa were not successful. however, these results indicate that even if the nifq genes found in n. galegae have diverged from the corresponding genes in related rhizobial species, these are required for nitrogen fixation.

secretion systems of type iv and vi are common in n. galegae
because of their interesting ecological functions, the presence of type iv and type vi secretion systems  similar to those previously found in hambi 540t and hambi  <dig> was investigated in the eight newly sequenced strains . a t6ss was previously identified in hambi 540t, while strain hambi  <dig> has two different types of t4sss  <cit> . the two t4sss in hambi  <dig> belong to the quorum sensing -regulated conjugation system  and a type iv conjugation system, based on homology to systems assigned to these types defined by both structural and phylogenetic analyses by ding and co-workers  <cit> . among the three different kinds of secretion systems analysed in n. galegae, the t4ss of type i found on the symbiosis plasmid of hambi  <dig> was the least well represented in the new strains. although the t4sss could be identified as being homologs of one of the two systems present in hambi  <dig>  the gene content was not always entirely the same as is found in hambi  <dig>  in hambi  <dig> there is a trai/trar/tram qs regulation system present on the plasmid phambi1141b together with the t4ss genes of type i. in hambi  <dig>  there is what seems to be an incomplete set of qs-related genes located  <dig> kb from the t4ss of type iv, with two trar-like genes and one trai homolog but no tram gene. in hambi  <dig>  the tramr genes are present associated with the t4ss of type i, but no trai gene could be found. in addition, the traacdg genes are missing. however, the identified type i conjugation system genes in hambi  <dig> are split onto two different contigs, and thus it is possible that the traiacdg genes could not be identified due to a gap in between these contigs. in the same strain there is also a t4ss of type iv with a virb8-like gene that is interrupted by a stop codon in the middle of the gene.table  <dig>

t6ss genes were found in strains hambi 540t, hambi  <dig>  hambi  <dig>  hambi  <dig>  hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig>  these strains all have the same t6ss genes arranged in the same gene organisation, the whole gene region showing  <dig> - <dig> % nucleotide identity compared to hambi 540t, with the exception of strain hambi  <dig> which has a nucleotide identity of  <dig> %. however, despite the relative abundance of these secretion systems observed in the sequenced n. galegae strains, the presence of a certain kind of secretion system could not be linked to strains of either symbiovar.

ortholog groups define genes common in specified subgroups
analysis of ortholog groups was performed on the proteomes of the ten sequenced n. galegae strains, to find genes typical for the species and those typical of subgroups of the species. based on the  <dig> ortholog groups shared by all ten strains, the core genome of n. galegae comprises between  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins per strain. the number of strain-specific genes  ranges from  <dig> in hambi  <dig> to  <dig> in hambi  <dig>  to investigate whether there are symbiovar-specific genes that could be revealed through analysis of the cdss of the ten sequenced strains, ortholog groups containing genes from all five strains of one symbiovar, but not a single gene of strains representing the other symbiovar, were targeted. this analysis revealed  <dig> orientalis-specific ortholog groups and  <dig> officinalis-specific ortholog groups . the officinalis-specific genes are interesting in that all of the  <dig> genes which are not located on the chromosome of the reference genome, are located either within the symbiosis gene region defined by the nod, nif and fix genes, or within  <dig> genes downstream of node. also among the orientalis-specific genes, 20% are located in the corresponding downstream region of node in hambi 540t. in order to investigate a possible connection between the rpon <dig> gene and orientalis-specific genes, the putative promoter regions of the orientalis-specific genes were scanned for possible rpon binding sites in strain hambi 540t. however, the only possible  motif found was located 238– <dig> bp upstream of the hypothetical protein gene pa <dig> table  <dig>

another orthomcl analysis was performed comparing the proteomes of hambi 540t, hambi  <dig> and eight strains representing closely related rhizobial species . when the n. galegae-specific ortholog groups of this analysis were compared to the core genome of n. galegae revealed by the analysis of the ten n. galegae strains, finally  <dig> ortholog groups were found to be common to and specific for all n. galegae strains . among these,  <dig> groups consisted of hypothetical proteins, and based on current knowledge none of the remaining ones seem to be directly related to known symbiotic functions.

based on results from a greenhouse experiment testing the plant growth promoting capacity of n. galegae strains, the sv. orientalis strains hambi 540t, hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig> are very good nitrogen fixers , while strains hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig> show a lower level of nitrogen fixation  . to test whether there is a genomics-based pattern that could explain the differences in plant growth promoting efficiency, the orthomcl results were analysed from a point of view focusing on the nitrogen fixation properties of the strains. when ortholog groups containing genes shared by the fix++ sv. orientalis strains but not present in the fix+ strains were analysed,  <dig> such groups were found . among these groups,  <dig> were unique to the fix++ sv. orientalis strains, i.e. genes not found in any other of the analysed strains but hambi 540t, hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig> figure  <dig> average dry weight of g. orientalis plants inoculated with the genome-sequenced strains. “control” is the uninoculated control, while hambi  <dig> is included as a reference for ineffective strains. dry weight values represent the sum of three plants grown in the same pot. error bars represent standard error. n =  <dig> for all strains except for hambi  <dig> and hambi  <dig> for which n =  <dig>

discussion
eight draft genomes of n. galegae were produced to enable a more profound study of the bacterial genomics contributing to the host specificity observed in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between this bacterium and its host plants. results of this study show that a major part of the genomes consist of genes common to all analysed n. galegae strains, while the two symbiovars can be separated based on a fairly limited set of genes only. the number of strain-specific genes varies a lot between strains, as does the number of replicons present, even if none of the sequenced strains has more than four replicons. similar conclusions have been drawn for e.g. s. meliloti  <cit>  and r. etli  <cit> .

t4sss and t6sss are probably not related to symbiosis in n. galegae
type iv and type vi secretion systems in bacteria are important machineries contributing to ecological functions. t4sss contribute to horizontal gene transfer and might be responsible for transfer of symbiosis genes between strains. in Österman et al.  <dig>  <cit>  we speculated that the t6ss could play a role in the host specificity of n. galegae, being present in hambi 540t but not in hambi  <dig>  however, the present study shows that the presence of a certain secretion system can not be attributed to one symbiovar or the other, but these can be found in strains of both symbiovars of n. galegae. there are some indications that the t4sss found in n. galegae strains are undergoing changes. the atypical set of qs-related genes in strain hambi  <dig>  which has a t4ss classified as type iv , is not necessarily related to regulation of t4s. moreover, it remains unknown whether the interrupted virb8-type gene in hambi  <dig> renders this t4ss non-functional. the identified t6ss, on the other hand, seems well conserved in the strains of n. galegae where such a system is found.

the specific functions of rpon <dig> and nifq are important for nitrogen fixation
the presence of a gene coding for a hypothetical protein followed by a second rpon gene copy  in the symbiosis gene region appears to be a symbiovar orientalis-specific trait. the absence of amino acid substitutions in the rpon <dig> proteins of the analysed strains indicates that the product of this second rpon might perform a very specific function. when compared to the rpon <dig> proteins, there is an accumulation of substitutions in the n-terminal region . these differences might affect interactions with target dna and activator proteins, resulting in transcription of different types of genes as observed in e.g. rhodobacter sphaeroides  <cit>  or transcription under different conditions. two rpon genes have been found also in other rhizobia, but the reported involvement in symbiosis differs. in bradyrhizobium japonicum, both rpon genes could replace each other functionally, although one of them was regulated in response to oxygen  <cit> . in r. etli, symbiotic nitrogen fixation was drastically reduced when the rpon <dig> gene was mutated, while mutation of the rpon <dig> gene did not affect nitrogen fixation levels  <cit> . the rpon <dig> gene was not expressed aerobically, but was strongly induced in bacteroids. also in mesorhizobium loti, the rpon <dig> gene located on the symbiosis island has been shown to be essential for nitrogen fixation, whereas the chromosomally located rpon <dig> gene is dispensable for nitrogen fixation  <cit> . the results of this study clearly show that the rpon <dig> gene of n. galegae is required for nitrogen fixation, but a possible function in determining host specificity should be further investigated. the hypothetical protein gene preceding the rpon gene varies in size between strains, but is nonetheless always part of the same ortholog group. there are, however, no clues to the possible function of this gene.

the nifq gene of n. galegae was previously the target of speculations that this gene is non-functional in this species, because of the apparent diversification of this gene from the corresponding gene in related species, as well as the lack of a molybdenum-binding motif  <cit> . however, this study showed that nifq is in fact very well conserved within symbiovars, indicating that this could be an important protein after all. gene replacement deletion studies performed in this work showed that the nifq gene in both symbiovars is required for nitrogen fixation, although the importance of the observed differences in its protein sequence would deserve attention in future studies. experiments with different levels of molybdenum could have been done to study the effect of the concentration of available molybdenum on the mutant phenotype. however, the results obtained with the conditions used provided enough evidence of the involvement of nifq in symbiosis, leaving studies on the effect of the molybdenum level on functional symbiosis to the future.

analysis of ortholog groups revealed potential future target genes in research on the effectiveness of nitrogen fixation
orthomcl analyses allowed the definition of the n. galegae core genome as well as a set of genes from the core genome that could not be found in related rhizobial species. information about the core genome is useful when characteristics of all strains of n. galegae are studied, while information on the n. galegae-specific portion of the core genome might be useful when studying differences between n. galegae and other nitrogen fixers. more specifically, the orthomcl analysis of ten n. galegae strains revealed symbiovar-specific gene sets, as well as genes present in strains of sv. orientalis known to be good nitrogen fixers while missing in strains known to be less efficient plant growth promoters.

the genes found to be symbiovar-specific are mostly genes involved in transcriptional regulation and metabolic functions. these are not genes that have previously been directly associated with nitrogen fixation, but their possible involvement needs to be investigated in future experiments. in addition, as seen with the rpon <dig> gene located in the symbiosis gene region of sv. orientalis strains, symbiovar-specific gene variants that have high sequence homology with other genes within the genome may not be detected as symbiovar-specific by the orthomcl analysis even if these are functionally different and obviously contribute to the pool of genes separating the two groups of strains. the possibility of the orientalis-specific genes being regulated by the orientalis-specific rpon <dig> was investigated by searching for known rpon binding motifs in upstream intergenic regions of these genes. the absence of probable rpon binding motifs could mean that rpon <dig> is either not connected to these genes or it is so specific that it recognises a modified rpon binding motif compared to the known −24/- <dig> promoter  <cit> .

among the genes typical for good n. galegae nitrogen fixers in sv. orientalis were the norefcbqd genes, which are all part of the nitric oxide  reductase  <cit> , and the nnrsr genes. the nnrs gene codes for a haem- and copper-containing membrane protein that is regulated by the product of nnrr  <cit> . these genes were also found as members of the accessory genome relevant for symbiotic interactions in s. meliloti  <cit> . no production has been observed in functional nodules in bacteroid-containing cells during medicago truncatula – s. meliloti symbiosis  <cit>  and has been found to have an important role in stress adaptation and the early stage of lotus japonicus – m. loti symbiosis  <cit> . the fixlj genes are positive regulators of symbiotic expression of nif and fix genes  <cit> , but also expression of the nor genes is dependent on the fixlj-fixk <dig> regulatory cascade in concert with no-activated nnrr under microaerobic conditions  <cit> . in the light of this information, the presence of no reduction genes in the efficient nitrogen fixers of n. galegae indicates that the possibility to reduce no might be an advantage for nitrogen fixation.

b. japonicum usda  <dig> has been found to express genes involved in organic sulphur utilisation in root nodules  <cit> . the transporter genes for aliphatic sulfonates also found in the sv. orientalis fix++-specific gene set are involved in transport of alternative sources of sulphur  <cit>  that can be used for amino acid synthesis. this possibility might be an advantage for strains under stressful conditions.

another gene found to be present in all superior sv. orientalis nitrogen fixers but none of the less efficient ones, was an ntrp gene. the ntrp gene is an antitoxin gene forming a toxin-antitoxin  module with ntrr in s. meliloti  <cit> , found to regulate metabolic processes under stressful conditions such as those encountered when entering symbiosis. the presence of ntrp, binding to ntrr, lowers the negative effect of ntrr, thereby allowing a higher level of expression of genes favourable for nitrogen fixation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on the genomic comparisons performed in this study, differences in genes known to be directly symbiosis-related are small between strains of different symbiovars of n. galegae. nevertheless, the observed symbiovar orientalis-specific rpon <dig> gene as well as the nifq gene, found in both symbiovars, were shown to be important for functional nitrogen fixation. the specific impact of these genes on host specificity should be further investigated. secretion systems of type iv and type vi are common among strains of n. galegae, but do not seem to be involved in symbiotic functions. based on the functional annotations of genes present in strains known to be good plant growth promoters but not in less efficient ones, an improved ability of nitrogen fixation seems to be correlated with an improved ability to use different metabolic substrates and an optimised regulation of metabolic functions under stressful conditions.
