BACKGROUND
psychological conditions like attention  <cit>  and hypnotic effects  <cit>  exert powerful influences on human pain sensation  <cit> . the anterior cingulate cortex  is an area responsible for the affectional dimension of pain  <cit> . noxious stimulation applied to peripheral tissues evoked nociceptive responses in rodent cingulate areas  <cit>  lesions of which impaired place avoidance test while pain behavior on formalin test was normal  <cit> . the pfc has crucial roles in conscious pain but not the sensory-discriminative aspect of pain. the psychological modulatory influence on pain response in the pfc could be related to dense projections from the limbic areas  <cit> . influences of direct projections from the amygdala to the pfc on neural activities have been less investigated electrophysiologically. we analyzed how the projections alter the pfc neural discharges evoked by noxious stimulation.

neurons of the bla project directly to the pfc  <cit> , and terminate in layers ii and v of the pfc  <cit> . these projecting neurons from the bla, forming monosynaptic connections to pfc neurons, are glutamate immuno-positive  <cit> . bla-pfc projections using glutamate as a neurotransmitter have the potential to induce plastic changes in cortical synapses. in fact, hfs delivered to the amygdala induced long-term potentiation of field potentials in the pfc  <cit> . electrophysiological studies employing pfc slices showed hfs to induce long-term depression   <cit> . bla-pfc pathways may thus change long-lasting neuronal activities of pfc neurons.

da, which is considered to regulate attention in the pfc  <cit> , acts as a modulator and induces bidirectional excitatory or inhibitory effects on pfc neurons  <cit> . da also modifies plastic changes in pfc neurons of superficial layers  <cit> . microinjections of da into the acc reduced autotomy scores in a sciatic neurotomy model, indicating da in the pfc to block long-term nociceptive responses  <cit> . da in the pfc may thus modulate pain processing.

our experiments elucidated that the bla-pfc projections and the mesocortical da system affected discharges of pfc neurons elicited by noxious stimulation. the bla-pfc pathways, and influences of the da system on these pathways, may underlie psychological states mediating pain sensations.

RESULTS
nociceptive responses recorded in the pfc
mechanical stimulation induced excitatory responses in pfc neurons, with discharges of a specific high threshold type which persisted during and frequently after stimulation  <cit> . the spontaneous background discharges of these neurons usually showed the spindle bursts characteristic of urethane anesthesia. electrocorticograms  changed from slow waves with spindle bursts to low amplitude fast waves induced by mechanical stimulation . the nociceptive responses were recorded without adaptation, if mechanical stimulation was applied every  <dig> s. we also recorded electroencephalographic  data in the amygdala, which showed changes in responses to mechanical simulation similar to those in the pfc .

hfs delivered to the bla modified pain responses recorded in the pfc
hfs delivered to the bla impaired pfc nociceptive responses evoked by mechanical stimulation applied to the rat tail . lls of nociceptive responses appeared within  <dig> min and lasted more than  <dig> min after hfs. decreases in responses were to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the pre-hfs control level at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  . the mean discharge frequency of responses also decreased after hfs in the same manner as response duration . therefore, we used discharge duration to represent nociceptive responses in this study. nociceptive responses recovered to pre-hfs levels in approximately 90- <dig> min. microinjection of artificial cerebrospinal fluid  had no effects on control nociceptive responses in the pfc . hfs delivered to the bla clearly inhibited nociceptive responses in rats injected with acsf. at  <dig> and 30min after hfs, nociceptive responses were significantly suppressed. in the intact group nociceptive responses had not recovered to the pre-stimulus level at  <dig> min . in contrast, the acsf group responses recovered to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the pre-hfs level .

nmda receptor blockers impaired lls of nociceptive responses
nmda receptor blockers impaired effects of hfs on nociceptive responses. mk- <dig>  which had no effects on control nociceptive responses, completely inhibited the lls of nociceptive responses induced by hfs delivered to the bla . rates of changes in nociceptive responses were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the pre-hfs value at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  . as with mk- <dig>  microinjection of apv also reduced the effects of hfs on nociceptive responses . there were no significant differences in rates of changes versus the control value;  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min .

metabotropic glutamate receptor blocker
mcpg, an mglur group i and ii antagonist, partially impaired lls of nociceptive responses induced by hfs delivered to the bla . durations of nociceptive responses did not differ significantly from the control level at  <dig> min , or at  <dig> min . inhibitory effects were, in fact, observed only at  <dig> min after hfs  . however, the nociceptive response at  <dig> min was significantly longer than that of the acsf group . a selective antagonist of group ii mglur, ly <dig>  completely blocked lls of nociceptive responses induced by hfs . durations of pain responses were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ± <dig> % at  <dig> min  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  .

da depletion impaired lls of nociceptive responses
da depletion was established by apomorphine tests three weeks after 6-ohda injection into the medial forebrain bundle . in apomorphine test-positive animals, background ecog showed low voltage fast waves, as described in a previous report  <cit> . however, nociceptive responses were normally evoked by mechanical stimulation delivered to the tail. there was no difference in mean nociceptive responses  between the control and 6-ohda groups . hfs applied to the bla had no effects on the nociceptive responses in this group . rates of changes in nociceptive responses were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  after hfs . the duration of nociceptive responses tended to increase in da-depleted animals, but the difference versus the pre-hfs control value did not reach statistical significance.

da receptor subtype antagonists
a d <dig> receptor antagonist, sulpiride , was also injected into the pfc. sulpiride significantly blocked the inhibitory effects of hfs to the bla . durations of pain responses were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  and  <dig>  ± <dig>  <dig> % at  <dig> min  after hfs to the bla. in the sulpiride-treated group, the durations of pain responses tended to be increased but did not differ significantly from the pre-hfs control value .

a specific d <dig> receptor antagonist, l- <dig>   <dig> , also significantly blocked the lls of nociceptive responses induced by hfs without changes in either nociceptive responses or background ecog. durations of pain responses were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> min  after hfs to the bla . these results indicate that l- <dig>  blocks lls of nociceptive responses evoked by hfs applied to the bla.

discussion
we previously recorded nociceptive responses in layer ii and also found fos expression to be induced by mechanical noxious stimulation in surface layers of the pfc  <cit> . monosynaptic projections from the bla also terminated in layer ii of the pfc  <cit> . assuming that nociceptive information from peripheral nociceptors and inputs from the bla integrate at the same pyramidal cells in layer ii of the pfc, hfs delivered to bla-pfc may induce heterosynaptic plasticity. heterosynaptic-ltd, which has been demonstrated in perforant path synapses of the hippocampus  <cit> , is reportedly blocked by nmda receptor blockers  <cit> . in our experiments, apv and mk- <dig> impaired lls of nociceptive responses. nmda receptor activities were required for the induction of lls of nociceptive responses, suggesting heterosynaptic-ltd like mechanisms to underlie these responses. brief application of group i and ii mglur agonists  <cit>  or co-activation of mglur ii and nmda receptors reportedly induces ltd in pyramidal neurons  <cit> . depolarization of postsynaptic cells is indispensable for mglur mediated heterosynaptic-ltd  <cit> . in our experiments, glutamate release via ascending pathways relying sensory information and nmda activation by hfs delivered to the bla produced lls of nociceptive responses in the pfc characterizing the responses as ltd.

the da system has been assumed to modulate pfc plasticity  <cit> . co-application of da and the mglur agonist without tetanic stimulation induced ltd in pfc pyramidal neurons  <cit> . da does not directly mediate synaptic transmission but affects it by altering the synaptic properties of target neurons  <cit> . a behavioral study of pain demonstrated that da depletion induces significant changes in thresholds for mechanical noxious stimuli  <cit> . partial da depletion in our experiments had no effects on nociceptive responses themselves but blocked plastic changes in nociceptive responses. da application produces only a small membrane depolarization  in pyramidal cells  <cit>  but affects spike afterpotentials  <cit>  which consist of after-hyperpolarization or depolarization. partial depletion of da may inhibit slow after-depolarization followed by lls induction, while having little effect on the initiation of action potentials  <cit> . emotional influences of inputs from the bla on pfc nociceptive responses might be modulated by da.

a d <dig> receptor antagonist, sulpiride, blocked lls of nociceptive responses in the pfc. postsynaptic d <dig> receptor activities reduce membrane depolarization evoked by a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid agonist application  <cit> . moreover, d <dig> receptor knockout mice showed impaired ltd induction in response to tetanic stimulation delivered to cortico-striatal pathways  <cit> . in addition to postsynaptic d <dig> receptor inhibitory effects, presynaptic d <dig> receptors showed impaired glutamate release in the ventral tegmental area  <cit> . d <dig> antagonists may affect both pre- and post-synaptic receptors and thereby block the induction of lls of nociceptive responses. d <dig> receptors, which are highly expressed in pfc pyramidal cells  <cit> , inhibit adenylate cyclase through gi/o-proteins by functioning as d2-like receptors  <cit> . electrophysiological experiments using current and voltage clamp methods demonstrated spontaneous hyper-excitability of pyramidal neurons in a d <dig> receptor knockout mouse model  <cit> . hence, d <dig> receptors normally exert an inhibitory influence on the activities of pyramidal neurons. d <dig> receptor activities may facilitate induction of lls of nociceptive responses by hfs delivered to the bla.

according to human brain image analysis, the strength of conscious pain reflects activities of the acc  <cit> . bla-pfc projections may transmit aversive information from the limbic area to the pfc, which is involved in psychological states of dependent pain sensation like fear conditioning analgesia. bla-pfc pathways are reportedly involved in fear expression and extinction  <cit> . nmda activation in the bla and pfc are required for relearning of inhibitory fear responses in extinction  <cit> . our lls results suggest that impulses from the bla depressed nociceptive responses, as a consequence, pain recognition in the pfc was inhibited in fear responses.

the mesocortical da system from the ventral tegmental area to the pfc plays roles in psychological conditions such as attention and motivation. our results indicate that amygdala inputs to the pfc influence pain sensations via emotional stimulation and that the da system exerts modulatory effects on conscious pain processing.

CONCLUSIONS
mechanical noxious stimulation applied to peripheral tissue evoked nociceptive discharges in the pfc. hfs delivered to the bla inhibited nociceptive responses, which are involved in the mglur-mediated ltd-like mechanism. this inhibition was impaired by da receptor subtype  blockers. bla-pfc projections influence pain responses and the da system exerts modulatory effects on pain responses recorded in the pfc. inputs from the bla and da system to the pfc may be responsible for conscious pain.
