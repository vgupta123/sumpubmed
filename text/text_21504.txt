BACKGROUND
drought is a major abiotic stress that limits crop productivity  <cit> . climate change models predict an increase in summer drying in the midlatitudes, which could contribute to an increase in the number of episodes of drought  <cit> . engineering plants with enhanced tolerance of abiotic stresses such as drought is a major objective of plant biotechnology that is expected to be commercialized in the near future  <cit> . tolerance to abiotic stress may be achieved through the modification of endogenous plant pathways, often by manipulating important regulatory proteins such as transcription factors. altering the level of expression of key transcription factors involved in abiotic stress pathways has been shown to enhance tolerance to various abiotic stresses in arabidopsis  <cit>  as well as in important crop species such as rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and alfalfa  <cit> .

traits involving tolerance to abiotic stresses are considered to be more complex than those that are currently commercialized due to the large number of genes and pathways that may be affected. furthermore, the interaction between plants and the environment is an intricate, continuous process that has been difficult to characterize, further adding to the complexity of manipulating abiotic stress tolerance traits. the increased complexity of these traits may correspond with a greater potential for unintended effects to occur in transgenic plants.

in transgenic systems, two different types of unintended effects are generally known to occur  <cit> . position effects are attributed to the insertion of a transgene at a particular locus in the genome and the resulting interference this might cause. these effects will vary with the site of integration and will therefore be unique to each independent plant line. position effects can be easily eliminated by screening for plant lines that have no or little position effects. in contrast, pleiotropic effects are independent of the site of transgene insertion and are the sum of all the phenotypic effects caused by expression of the transgene. while some of these may be the intended trait, others may occur through unexpected interactions of the gene with plant processes and constitute the unintended pleiotropic effects. these effects are of greater interest since they are more difficult to eliminate and more likely to create safety issues.

engineering more complex traits such as abiotic stress tolerance in plants through the manipulation of transcription factors may uncover cryptic properties of the transcription factor that could produce some of the unintended pleiotropic effects. many transcription factors are part of large families that have complex evolutionary histories  <cit> . these families typically arise through gene duplications followed by functional divergence in separate expression domains or through the acquisition of new functions. these processes often result in functional redundancies within the families that can be difficult to detect. furthermore, some transcription factors may retain ancestral functions that are sometimes only revealed by altering the normal pattern of expression. therefore the manipulation of transcription factors in engineering complex traits such as abiotic stress tolerance may be likely to produce unintended pleiotropic effects.

the use of non-targeted global profiling technologies, such as microarray analysis, to identify unintended effects in plant systems has proven an effective means of determining the "substantial equivalence" of a transgenic plant to its non-transgenic counterpart. such approaches have been used to investigate unintended effects in a number of transgenic plant systems  <cit> . to date, these studies have primarily focused on simple, monogenic traits such as those that are currently commercially grown. as transgenic crops with more complex traits involving the modification of endogenous plant pathways will soon be entering the market, it is important to extend these analyses to investigate the potential for unintended pleiotropic effects in such systems.

in order to understand the extent and kinds of unintended effects that could be induced in transgenic plants engineered for complex traits, we conferred drought tolerance on arabidopsis thaliana by overexpressing the transcription factor abf <dig>  this system targets drought resistance, a trait that will likely enter the market in the near future. since transcription factors ultimately function by altering the levels of expression of target genes, we investigated unintended effects using microarray analysis to survey global gene expression profiles. in order to eliminate position effects in our analysis and focus on the pleiotropic unintended effects, we employed the cre/lox system to excise the abf <dig> transgene from the site of insertion, leaving behind the selectable marker, to create control plant lines. without the abf <dig> transgene, the pleiotropic effects will be absent but the site of integration is still interrupted by the selectable marker such that position effects are maintained in these lines.

abf <dig> belongs to the abf/areb subfamily of bzip transcription factors which consists of thirteen members in arabidopsis. several members have been shown to function in aba signalling either during seed maturation or in response to stress  <cit> . these factors can bind to aba-response elements , cis-regulatory elements found in the promoters of many aba- and stress-responsive genes  <cit> . in addition to drought tolerance, overexpression of abf <dig> confers tolerance to salt, cold, heat, and oxidative stresses, suggesting that it regulates multiple abiotic stress pathways in arabidopsis  <cit> . three other abf/areb transcription factors are predicted to function in aba-dependent stress signalling based on expression profiling and overexpression studies. expression of abf <dig> is induced by cold-treatment  <cit> . abf2/areb <dig> is induced by salt-treatment as well as dehydration but not cold and overexpression confers tolerance to a wide range of abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, heat, and oxidative stress  <cit> . interestingly, abf2/areb <dig> also appears to function in glucose signalling as well as in the regulation of seedling growth  <cit> . abf4/areb <dig> is expressed in response to cold, drought, and salt and overexpression renders plants tolerant to drought and salt  <cit> . therefore, abf <dig> likely shares some redundant functions with other members of the abf/areb subfamily.

plant response to drought involves changes in the expression patterns of a large number of genes  <cit>  and, in addition to members of the abf/areb family, a number of other transcription factors have been identified that play a role in the drought response in arabidopsis. these include the ap2/erf transcription factors dreb2a, dreb2b, and cbf <dig>  <cit> , atmyb <dig>  which functions in concert with atmyc <dig>  <cit> , and the nac family transcription factors anac <dig>  anac055/atnac <dig>  and anac072/rd <dig>  <cit> , which at least partially function in concert with a zinc finger homeodomain protein zfhd <dig>  <cit> . therefore, while overexpression of abf <dig> affects one of the key drought response pathways, it is not the only pathway mediating the drought response at the gene expression level.

the use of the cre/lox system to create control lines also created an opportunity to examine the effects of the cre/lox system on the transcriptome. site-specific recombination technologies can be used to excise selectable markers or other undesirable genetic elements and can also be used to direct site-specific integration of transgenes  <cit> . while many studies have employed cre-mediated recombination in plant systems with no apparent unintended effects  <cit> , other studies have observed a range of abnormal phenotypes including growth defects, leaf chlorosis, delayed flowering, and male sterility  <cit> . in tobacco plants transformed with a chloroplast targeted cre recombinase, recombination was observed involving cryptic lox sites in the plastid genome, but invariably the second lox site was located within the transgene  <cit> . these recombinations could result in deletions of up to  <dig> kb, but they did not cause any deleterious effects in the plants  <cit> . studies in animal systems have similarly revealed that cre recombinase can have unintended effects, often leading to chromosomal aberrations  <cit> .

these studies suggest that the cre/lox system has the potential to cause unintended effects in plant systems, by mediating recombination with cryptic lox sites that may be present in the genome resulting in large deletions. such cryptic lox sites are difficult to identify since they may deviate substantially from conventional loxp sites  <cit>  and not all of the unintended effects may produce readily apparent phenotypic abnormalities, so studying the unintended effects of cre recombinase using a non-targeted approach such as microarray analysis is essential for establishing the utility and safety of this technology.

in this study, we performed microarray analysis on arabidopsis plants engineered to be drought-tolerant through overexpression of the transcription factor abf <dig> with the goal of identifying unintended pleiotropic effects. the results suggest that overexpression of abf <dig> has a minimal impact on the transcriptome, with differences in the gene expression pattern only detectable in response to drought and then being suggestive of transcriptional reprogramming as opposed to the activation of novel pathways. in addition, we examined the impact of cre recombinase on the transcriptome to detect any unintended effects of this technology and found that it had minimal effects on gene expression patterns in plants following transgene excision.

RESULTS
phenotype of plants overexpressing abf3
a construct was created containing the camv 35s promoter followed by the coding sequence of abf <dig> and then the nopaline synthase transcriptional terminator, all of which was flanked by two loxp sites . this construct was transformed into arabidopsis thaliana to generate 35s:abf <dig> plants. fifty-nine independent transformants were recovered and three high-expressing lines containing single insertions were selected for further analysis .

control plant lines were generated by excising the 35s:abf <dig> transgene, leaving only the selectable marker transgene at the site of insertion . this was achieved by crossing 35s:abf <dig> plants with plants expressing the cre recombinase gene and then backcrossing the progeny to wild-type arabidopsis to remove the cre recombinase gene, generating three control lines . the loss of both the abf <dig> transgene and the cre recombinase transgene was confirmed by pcr .

previously, arabidopsis plants overexpressing abf <dig> were found to be more tolerant to drought conditions, which could at least partially be attributed to a lower rate of transpiration  <cit> . to confirm that the 35s:abf <dig> lines show a similar phenotype, the transpiration rate was determined. excised leaves from 4-week-old 35s:abf <dig> plants left at room temperature for  <dig> day lost less fresh weight than both wild-type and control plants, indicating a lower rate of transpiration . in addition, 35s:abf <dig> plants showed a mild growth retardation that became more evident as plants matured , which is also consistent with previous results  <cit> .

identification of position effects and impact of cre recombinase on the transcriptome
microarray analysis of control plant lines was performed to identify position effects as well as to determine if use of the cre/lox system can cause unintended effects in plant systems. position effects should be specific to each of the three control lines, as each line is expected to have a unique insertion site. in contrast, unintended effects resulting from excision at cryptic lox sites are more likely to affect independent plant lines similarly, since cryptic sites that may be present in the arabidopsis genome will equally be found in each plant line.

using a p-value cut-off of  <dig> , only a small number of genes were differentially expressed in control lines compared to wild-type plants . in the control- <dig> line, only a single gene was differentially expressed. in the control- <dig> and - <dig> lines,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed and two of these, rps <dig>  and rps <dig>   , were common to both lines. these genes could represent either position effects or natural background variation in gene expression. the rps <dig> and rps <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed in both control- <dig> and - <dig> lines may reflect unintended effects of the cre/lox system.

effect of abf <dig> overexpression on the transcriptome in the absence of drought
microarray analysis of 35s:abf <dig> plants was performed to identify unintended effects resulting from overexpression of a transcription factor in the absence of stress. expression of abf <dig> in the absence of stress is generally very low but it is rapidly induced in response to aba  <cit> . overexpression of abf <dig> would therefore be expected to initiate those pathways that are typically activated in response to stress via aba-mediated signalling. this has been observed for other transcription factors and is generally used as a means of identifying targets of that particular transcription factor  <cit> .

three independent plant lines containing the 35s:abf <dig> transgene were compared to the corresponding control plant lines from which the 35s:abf <dig> transgene was excised. based on microarray analysis, using a cut-off of p <  <dig> , only a small number of genes  were differentially expressed in the three 35s:abf <dig> transgenic plant lines . the only gene that was differentially expressed in all three plant lines was abf <dig>

drought response of 35s:abf <dig> plants
overexpression of abf <dig> in arabidopsis confers enhanced drought tolerance  <cit> . since abf <dig> is a transcription factor, it is likely that this is achieved at the level of gene expression. therefore, microarray analysis should provide insight into the mechanism of drought tolerance. since the expression pattern of abf <dig> during the drought response is achieved by constitutive overexpression from the camv 35s promoter, it is possible that unintended effects may also be generated downstream. by comparing the transcriptional profile of 35s:abf <dig> plants to control plants, it may be possible to identify these unintended effects. two time points were examined in order to consider both early and late responses to drought. for this analysis, the control- <dig> and 35s:abf3- <dig> lines were selected as the control- <dig> lines showed the smallest number of differentially expressed genes .

following  <dig> h of drought stress, using a cut-off of p <  <dig>  and a fold-change of  <dig>   <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the control plants exposed to drought stress compared to unstressed control plants and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in 35s:abf <dig> plants exposed to drought stress compared to unstressed 35s:abf <dig> plants. following  <dig> h of drought stress,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in control plants exposed to drought stress compared to unstressed control plants and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in 35s:abf <dig> plants exposed to drought stress compared to unstressed 35s:abf <dig> plants.

in order to compare the profile of genes expressed in the two plant lines in response to drought stress, functional categorizations of the differentially expressed genes were obtained from the arabidopsis information resource  and compared. although the profile of genes differentially expressed in control and 35s:abf <dig> plants show some differences, overall they show a similar pattern of distribution among the different functional classes . the greatest difference between 35s:abf <dig> and control plant lines in the percentage of genes belonging to a particular functional category was  <dig> % for the 'other metabolic processes' category at the  <dig> h time point. this suggests that the overall functional response of 35s:abf <dig> and control plant lines at the gene expression level was similar.

in total,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in at least one plant line during at least one time point. the overlap in genes expressed in the two plant lines at the two different time points is depicted with a four-way venn diagram in figure  <dig>  these genes can be subdivided into three categories. there are  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in both control and 35s:abf <dig> lines at the same time points suggesting that they were commonly regulated in both lines. there are  <dig> genes that are regulated differently in control and 35s:abf <dig> plant lines that show an enhanced response in the 35s:abf <dig> line. finally, there are  <dig> genes that are regulated differently in control and 35s:abf <dig> plant lines that show an attenuated response in the 35s:abf <dig> line. in the latter two categories, these genes are either uniquely differentially expressed in one line or the other, or they are differentially expressed in one line at one time point but not in the other line at that time point. since only two time points were examined, it is difficult to determine if the observed differences in the two lines are due to differences in the timing of gene expression or in the magnitude of gene expression or some combination of both of these factors. additional file  <dig> contains a list of all of the differentially expressed genes found in each of the three categories.

in order to confirm the microarray results, rt-pcr was performed on  <dig> genes from the enhanced and attenuated categories. twenty-nine of the examined genes exhibited expression patterns that were consistent with the microarray results, confirming the reliability of the microarray data . amplification of one gene, at2g <dig>  produced two bands, one corresponding to the expected size of  <dig> bp. the primers for this gene were designed around an intron and the size of the second band is similar to the  <dig> bp that would be expected if the intron were not spliced, suggesting that this band may represent a splice variant.

genes commonly regulated in both 35s:abf <dig> and control lines
there are  <dig> genes that are commonly regulated in both 35s:abf <dig> and control lines. of these,  <dig> show differential expression in both lines at both time points,  <dig> are only differentially expressed at  <dig> h and  <dig> are only differentially expressed at  <dig> h.

a number of genes in this category are known to act in pathways that are upstream or independent of abf <dig>  which is consistent with their common pattern of regulation in both 35s:abf <dig> and control plant lines . since abf <dig> is an aba-dependent transcription factor, aba biosynthesis should occur upstream of abf <dig> activity. consistent with this, atnced <dig> , which encodes a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase enzyme involved in aba biosynthesis, was upregulated in both lines at both time points in response to drought treatment as was the gene cyp707a <dig> , which encodes a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase involved in aba catabolism.

values are log <dig> fold changes.

several transcription factors have been identified that mediate drought response pathways independent from the abf <dig> pathway. members of the dreb family of transcription factors function in abiotic stress signalling and members of the dreb <dig> subfamily are known to function in aba-independent drought stress signalling  <cit> . dreb2a  and dreb2b , as expected, were upregulated in response to drought in both plant lines at both time points . in addition, dreb1b/cbf <dig>  and dreb1c/cbf <dig>  were also upregulated in both lines at both time points and ddf <dig>  was upregulated at  <dig> h . while the dreb <dig> subfamily is primarily associated with cold stress signalling  <cit> , there is some evidence that members also function in dehydration stress  <cit> .

three nac transcription factors also function in a drought signalling pathway that is independent from abf <dig>  <cit> . anac <dig> , anac055/atnac <dig> , and anac072/rd <dig>  are all expressed at both time points in both plant lines . another six members of the nac family of transcription factors  are also commonly regulated in both 35s:abf <dig> and control plant lines .

also in this category are many genes that are known to be regulated in response to drought stress. this includes genes involved in the biosynthesis of osmolytes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins , kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors, as well as several different types of transporters . this further suggests that some drought signalling pathways are unaffected by abf <dig> overexpression

values are log <dig> fold changes.

genes with an enhanced response in 35s:abf <dig> plants
there are  <dig> genes that demonstrated an enhanced response in 35s:abf <dig> plants. of these,  <dig> are uniquely regulated in 35s:abf <dig> plants with  <dig> differentially expressed at both time points,  <dig> differentially expressed only at  <dig> h and  <dig> differentially expressed at  <dig> h. in addition,  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in the control line at only  <dig> h and  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in the control line at only  <dig> h while in the 35s:abf <dig> line they are differentially expressed at both time points. finally, there is a transposable element gene that is differentially expressed in 35s:abf <dig> plants at  <dig> h but is only differentially expressed in control plants at  <dig> h.

a number of genes in this category could contribute to the enhanced drought tolerance of 35s:abf <dig> plants . several genes involved in the biosynthesis of the osmolyte trehalose show enhanced upregulation while two genes involved in osmolyte catabolism show enhanced downregulation. two genes involved in detoxification show enhanced upregulation in 35s:abf <dig> as do three lea proteins. a number of transporters also show enhanced regulation in 35s:abf <dig> lines.

values are log <dig> fold changes.

direct targets of abf <dig> are likely found in this category of genes. in addition to showing enhanced regulation in 35s:abf <dig> plants, it is expected that these genes possess at least one abre in their promoter. in addition, these genes are likely to be significantly differentially expressed at the  <dig> h time point. amongst those genes showing an enhanced response in 35s:abf <dig> plants that are significantly differentially expressed at the  <dig> h time point,  <dig> contain at least one abre according to the in silico analysis performed by gómez-porras et al  <cit>  and are therefore identified as putative abf <dig> targets . included in this group are four transcription factors, one choline kinase, one trehalose biosynthetic enzyme, one gene involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, and two transporters as well as seven other genes with undefined roles in the drought response and eight unknown genes.

values are log <dig> fold changes.

amongst those genes that show an enhanced response in 35s:abf <dig> plants, there is an enrichment of genes that function in rna processing pathways . there are  <dig> genes involved in rna processing that are similarly regulated in both control and 35s:abf <dig> plants lines,  <dig> genes that show an attenuated response in 35s:abf <dig>  while  <dig> genes show an enhanced response. many of these appear to be uniquely downregulated in 35s:abf <dig> plants at  <dig> h. eleven of these are predicted to function in rna splicing or to be associated with the rna splicing machinery while the others have roles in nucleocytoplasmic transport, deadenylation, or the function is not specifically known. several genes that function in rna processing have been found to function in aba and abiotic stress signalling pathways  <cit> . this suggests that the differential regulation of rna processing genes in 35s:abf <dig> lines could contribute to its enhanced drought tolerance.

values are log <dig> fold changes.

interestingly, a member of the dreb family of transcription factors is also included in this group. dreb1d/cbf <dig>  was upregulated in 35s:abf <dig> plants at both time points but was only upregulated in control plants at  <dig> h. dreb1d/cbf <dig> functions in both cold and drought stress signalling and, unlike the dreb <dig> subfamily, its expression is induced by aba  <cit> . this suggests that cbf <dig> may act downstream of abf <dig> in the aba-dependent drought signalling pathway.

genes with an attenuated response in 35s:abf <dig> plants
there are  <dig> genes that show an attenuated response in 35s:abf <dig> plants. of these,  <dig> are uniquely regulated in control lines with  <dig> differentially expressed at both time points,  <dig> differentially expressed only at  <dig> h and  <dig> differentially expressed only at  <dig> h. in addition,  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in the 35s:abf <dig> line at only  <dig> h and  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in the 35s:abf <dig> line at only  <dig> h while in the control line they are differentially expressed at both time points. finally, there are  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed in the control line at  <dig> h and in the 35s:abf <dig> line at  <dig> h.

surprisingly, a number of genes that typically function in conferring drought tolerance show an attenuated response in 35s:abf <dig> plants. this includes several peroxidases and glutaredoxins involved in detoxification, two genes involved in biosynthesis of the osmolytes raffinose and spermine, a heat shock protein, and a number of transporters . similarly a number of transcription factors and other signalling components also show an attenuated response in 35s:abf <dig> plants. the reason for the attenuated response of these genes in 35s:abf <dig> plants is not clear but might reflect differences in the physiological state of 35s:abf <dig> plants due to their enhanced drought resistance.

a number of genes encoded by the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes show an attenuated response in 35s:abf <dig> plants . some of these genes encode proteins with electron transport activity or nadh dehydrogenase activity while others are predicted to function in transcription and translation processes. most of these genes are upregulated in control lines only at the  <dig> h time point. the reason for the exclusive upregulation of these genes in the control line is not clear. the chloroplast nadh dehydrogenase  complex is predicted to be involved in cyclic electron transport around photosystem i, thereby dissipating energy and maintaining atp supply under conditions of low co <dig> availability following stomatal closure in response to stress  <cit> . the ndh complex may also be involved in detoxification in the chloroplast  <cit> . the upregulation of genes encoding nadh dehydrogenases may therefore reflect the greater sensitivity of the control plant line to stress. rice plants overexpressing abf <dig> were able to maintain higher photochemical efficiency during drought stress  <cit> . this suggests that one aspect of the drought tolerance conferred by abf <dig> overexpression may be a minimization of the negative impact of drought stress on photosynthesis, which is reflected by differences in gene expression in the chloroplast. similar effects may also occur in the mitochondria.

values are log <dig> fold changes.

four transposable element genes were also included in the attenuated response category . only one other transposable element gene was significantly differentially expressed and it was included in the enhanced regulation category. many transposable elements are transcriptionally activated in response to stress conditions  <cit> . the attenuated regulation of transposable element genes in 35s:abf <dig> plants might suggest that they are experiencing a lower level of stress that is insufficient to activate the transposable element genes, consistent with the drought tolerance of these plants.

values are log <dig> fold changes.

interestingly, dreb1a/cbf <dig> showed an attenuated response in 35s:abf <dig> plants. dreb1a/cbf <dig> was upregulated in control plant lines at both time points but was only upregulated in 35s:abf <dig> plants at  <dig> h. this may again reflect differences in the tolerance of 35s:abf <dig> and control plants to the drought stress, with control plants requiring a stronger or longer activation of dreb1a/cbf <dig> expression in response to the increased stress.

discussion
the impact of cre recombinase on the transcriptome is minimal
in order to eliminate position effects and focus on unintended pleiotropic effects of transcription factor overexpression, the cre/lox recombination system was employed to create a series of control plant lines that contain the selectable marker at the site of transgene insertion but from which the abf <dig> transgene was excised. the use of the cre/lox recombination system also allowed us to determine the impact of cre recombinase on the transcriptome.

in tomato, petunia, tobacco, and to a lesser extent arabidopsis, expression of cre recombinase has resulted in abnormal phenotypes, including leaf chlorosis, stunted growth, and sterility  <cit> . similarly, expression of cre recombinase resulted in reduced proliferation and chromosomal abnormalities in cultured embryonic mouse cells  <cit> , toxicity in dividing cells of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , and chromosomal rearrangements in mouse spermatids leading to male sterility  <cit> . these abnormal effects of cre recombinase are suspected to result from cre-mediated recombination using cryptic lox sites that may be found in eukaryotic genomes. cryptic lox sites that can be recognized by cre recombinase have been identified in the genomes of yeast and humans as well as the chloroplast genome of tobacco  <cit> .

if cryptic lox sites exist in plant genomes, expression of cre recombinase could induce deletions or inversions of genome segments or even chromosome translocations that could adversely impact the plant. these deletions or inversions may alter the expression of genes found within this segment, which would be detectable by microarray. in three independent plants lines in which cre recombinase was employed to excise the abf <dig> transgene from the t-dna insertion, only a small number of genes were found to be differentially expressed . of these, two genes were found to be differentially expressed in two out of the three control lines. the two genes are the chloroplast encoded rps <dig>  and rps <dig>   genes. in tobacco, one of the cryptic lox sites identified in the chloroplast genome is found just downstream of the start site of the rps <dig> /rps <dig> operon  <cit> . the altered expression of rps <dig> might suggest that this cryptic lox site is conserved in arabidopsis and may have undergone cre-mediated recombination. cre recombinase may therefore also be able to act on cryptic lox sites in the arabidopsis chloroplast genome, resulting in a change in expression of the affected genes. it is, however, unclear how cre recombinase is targeted to the chloroplast since it is only predicted to be targeted to the nucleus. cre-mediated chloroplast genome deletions are not likely to be of great concern since chloroplast genomes containing deletions in essential genes are typically rapidly lost due to selection pressures  <cit> , especially once the cre recombinase has been removed. the impact of cre recombinase on the nuclear transcriptome was negligible, which demonstrates that in arabidopsis this technology does not produce unintended effects.

the activity of abf <dig> is strictly controlled
microarray analysis of arabidopsis plants overexpressing the transcription factor abf <dig> suggests that alterations to the transcriptome are minimal when position effects are eliminated as a source of variation. in the absence of stress, a small number of genes were differentially expressed in three 35s:abf <dig> plant lines , but no genes were differentially expressed in more than one independent line.

members of the abf/areb family of transcription factors bind to abres found in the promoters of aba-responsive genes  <cit> . if the genes identified by microarray analysis are actual downstream targets of abf <dig>  they would be expected to contain at least one abre. an in silico analysis of the arabidopsis nuclear genome has identified  <dig> genes containing one or more abres  <cit> . none of the nuclear genes identified by microarray analysis of 35s:abf <dig> transgenic plants are predicted to contain an abre. other members of the abf/areb subfamily of transcription factors localize to the nucleus  <cit> , and it is likely that abf <dig> similarly functions in the nucleus. therefore, it is unlikely that the chloroplast genes identified by microarray analysis are functional targets of abf <dig>  this suggests that overexpression of abf <dig> alone is not sufficient to alter the transcriptome.

this result was unexpected as previous work identified a number of genes with altered expression in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  overexpressing abf <dig>  similarly, overexpression studies of many other transcription factors have revealed alterations in gene expression and this approach is typically used to identify the gene network controlled by that particular transcription factor  <cit> . the absence of differentially expressed genes in 35s:abf <dig> transgenic plants suggests that an additional signal is required to activate abf <dig> that is not present in unstressed plants.

there is accumulating evidence that members of the abf/areb family of transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation. abf2/areb <dig> transactivation of a reporter gene in the presence of aba was inhibited by the addition of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine  <cit>  and abi <dig> is phosphorylated following aba treatment  <cit> . several studies have suggested a role for members of the snrk <dig> family of protein kinases in the phosphorylation of abf/areb transcription factors  <cit> . abf <dig> and abf4/areb <dig> interact with the calcium-dependent protein kinase atcpk <dig> and evidence suggests that it phosphorylates a highly conserved serine residue in abf4/areb <dig> that is necessary for activity  <cit> . the protein kinases cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> are also likely to phosphorylate abf <dig> and abf4/areb <dig> and their activity is enhanced by aba  <cit> . it is possible that in the absence of stress, abf <dig> is not phosphorylated and therefore cannot activate gene expression.

furthermore, other factors necessary for the activity of abf <dig> may not be expressed in the absence of abiotic stress. members of the abf/areb family have been shown to interact with diverse proteins that are predicted to modulate their transcriptional activity. abf2/areb <dig> interacts with an arm-repeat protein that is predicted to positively regulate its activity  <cit> . abi <dig>  abf <dig>  abf <dig>  and abf4/areb <dig> can interact with the transcription factor abi <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the rd29a promoter contains both an abre as well as a dehydration-responsive elements that is bound by members of the dreb/cbf family of transcription factors and the two elements function interdependently to activate expression of rd29a  <cit> . members of the abf/areb can also heterodimerize  <cit> , suggesting that other members of this family may need to be expressed in order for abf <dig> to be functional. therefore, it is possible that other components of the stress response pathway are necessary in order for abf <dig> to be active, preventing abf <dig> from altering gene expression in the absence of stress.

while the 35s:abf <dig> plants did not show any changes in transcription in the absence of drought stress, there were some phenotypic differences compared to control plants. most notably, the 35s:abf <dig> plants were smaller in size than control plants of the same age, with the difference becoming more pronounced with increased age . this is a common observation for plants overexpressing transcription factors  <cit>  and is often overcome by using tissue-specific or inducible promoters  <cit> . at least some of the growth retardation may be attributable to reduced transpiration rates of 35s:abf <dig> plants compared to control plants , which is consistent with the observation that arabidopsis plants overexpressing abf <dig> typically have stomata with smaller openings than do wild-type plants  <cit> . this would suggest that abf <dig> may govern gene networks involved in stomatal closure. consistent with this, abf <dig> is expressed in guard cells and its expression is further induced in these cells in response to aba  <cit> . since our analysis was performed on whole plants, it is likely that changes in the transcriptional network of guard cells would not be readily detectable.

overexpression of abf <dig> results in transcriptional reprogramming of the drought response
overexpression of abf <dig> confers drought tolerance to arabidopsis plants and since abf <dig> is a transcription factor, it can be predicted that this will occur through changes to the transcriptional network of the plants. consistent with this, the expression profile of arabidopsis plants overexpressing abf <dig> differed from that of control plants. as might be expected, there were a number of genes with expression patterns that appeared to be enhanced in 35s:abf <dig> plants compared to control plants. whether this occurred through alterations in the timing or strength of expression could not be established with the two time points considered in this study. many of the genes with enhanced expression are known to function in mitigating drought stress, suggesting that they could contribute incrementally to the enhanced drought tolerance of 35s:abf <dig> plants . those genes showing enhanced regulation in 35s:abf <dig> plants likely include some direct targets of abf <dig>  in particular, those genes that are differentially expressed at  <dig> h and contain at least one abre are the most likely targets of abf <dig> .

interestingly, there seemed to be a number of genes involved in rna processing that showed enhanced expression in 35s:abf <dig> plant lines. most of these were downregulated at the  <dig> h time point. a number of rna processing mutants impaired in aba response have demonstrated the importance of rna processing to aba signalling  <cit> . loss-of-function mutations in two genes encoding subunits of a nuclear cap-binding complex cause aba hypersensitivity  <cit>  as do mutations in a pre-mrna splicing factor that is important for both mrna splicing and turnover  <cit> , a poly-specific ribonuclease that is predicted to function in mrna degradation  <cit> , and a protein with homology to the sm-like small nuclear ribonucleoproteins  that function in mrna splicing, export, and degradation  <cit> . two phosphatases that belong to the family of proteins that dephosphorylate the c-terminal domain of rna polymerase ii negatively regulate stress-responsive gene transcription  <cit>  and a mutation in one of these results in decreased aba sensitivity  <cit> . the enrichment of genes involved in rna processing that show enhanced expression in the 35s:abf <dig> line might suggest that abf <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of aba-responsive rna processing events. the downregulation of many of the rna processing genes is consistent with the negative regulatory role observed for several of the rna processing proteins previously identified in the aba-signalling pathways.

in addition to those genes showing enhanced regulation in 35s:abf <dig> plants, there were also a number of genes with attenuated expression. many of these are known to encode proteins with roles in minimizing drought stress and their attenuated expression is not consistent with the drought tolerance of the 35s:abf <dig> plants. these genes may be reflective of a greater transcriptional reprogramming in 35s:abf <dig> plants than merely enhancing the rate or level of expression of a subset of genes. the strong activation of the abf <dig> pathway may result in co-ordinated feedback that modulates other drought responsive pathways, resulting in attenuated gene expression in some cases. this might reflect cooperativity between some of the drought signalling pathways. in many cases, drought-responsive transcription factors have been shown to function in concert to activate gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, it has been observed that downregulation of the phosphoinositide pathway in arabidopsis results in an upregulation of the dreb2a gene as well as several dreb2a-regulated genes, suggesting a negative interaction between two drought signalling pathways  <cit> .

the degree of stress experienced by the control plants should be greater than that experienced by the 35s:abf <dig> plants and this may ultimately have secondary consequences on the transcriptional network that is reflected by the genes showing an attenuated transcriptional response. this is consistent with the observation that several transposable element genes show attenuated expression in 35s:abf <dig> plants . many transposons are activated in response to stress  <cit>  and their delayed activation in 35s:abf <dig> plants could be a result of the drought tolerance of these plants.

similarly, the enrichment of genes encoded by the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes in the attenuated category  may also reflect the greater drought sensitivity of the control plant lines. drought has a significant and complex impact on the activities of both the mitochondria and chloroplasts and this is reflected in changes in gene expression  <cit> . several of the chloroplast and mitochondria-encoded genes showing attenuated expression encode nadh dehydrogenases. the chloroplast ndh complex is predicted to function in cyclic electron transport around photosystem i to help dissipate excess energy during abiotic stresses such as drought and thereby to alleviate oxidative stress  <cit> . the elevated expression of chloroplast ndh complex subunits and other chloroplast and mitochondria-encoded genes in control plants may therefore be indicative of the increased stress of these plants.

drought stress can change the composition of a plant, altering levels of oils, proteins and other constituents, which can affect the commercial and nutritional value of the plant  <cit> . in some cases, drought can also initiate the accumulation of higher levels of dangerous toxins and anti-nutrients  <cit> . the altered expression of transposable element genes and genes that are encoded by the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes in control plants suggests that these plants are experiencing a higher level of drought stress than 35s:abf <dig> plants. it is therefore possible that control plants exposed to drought will exhibit more compositional changes compared to unstressed plants than 35s:abf <dig> plants. this is an important consideration because compositional analysis is one of the parameters used to determine the substantial equivalence of transgenic plants to their non-transgenic comparators during the risk assessment process. these results might suggest that 35s:abf <dig> plants are better able to maintain compositional standards under drought stress than their non-transgenic counterparts.

overexpression of abf <dig> does not activate unintended gene networks during the drought response
while differences were observed in the patterns of gene expression of 35s:abf <dig> and control plant lines, at the functional level the response was very similar. functional categorization of the significantly differentially expressed genes demonstrated that the percentage of genes in each category was relatively similar between the two plant lines . this suggests that overexpression of abf <dig> does not activate new gene networks but simply functions to modify existing gene networks that function in drought response. although there were genes that were uniquely regulated in each of the two plant lines, many of these genes did observe a change in expression in the other plant line that was not of a high enough magnitude to meet our criteria for differential expression . this suggests that these genes are showing stronger and/or earlier differential regulation as opposed to being uniquely regulated.

among the genes that were differentially regulated between the 35s:abf <dig> and control plant lines, there was no indication that overexpression of abf <dig> activated any unintended gene networks. several closely related members of the abf/areb transcription factor family function in seed germination and seed and early seedling developmental pathways, including abi <dig> whose role in these pathways has been best characterized  <cit> . although abf <dig> is primarily associated with abiotic stress signalling in vegetative tissues, there is some evidence that it may also function in seed and early seedling developmental processes, although its role may be relatively minor. microarray data from genevestigator  <cit>  indicates that abf <dig> is expressed during seed development, although at low levels compared to abi <dig>  also, levels of abf <dig> are enhanced by dehydration and salinity stresses or by aba treatment in germinating embryos  <cit>  and an alternative splice form of the abf <dig> gene was identified from a cdna library prepared from immature seed  <cit> . double mutant analysis has also revealed several redundancies between abf <dig> and abi <dig>  including sensitivity to aba during germination, stress sensitivity of root growth, resistance to glucose, and regulation of the aba-induced vegetative expression of rab <dig> and rd29b  <cit> . abi <dig> and abf <dig> also appear to antagonistically cross-regulate each other  <cit> .

if abf <dig> does function in seed developmental pathways, it is possible that altering its pattern of expression could ectopically activate gene networks involved in those pathways. another member of the abf/areb family of transcription factors, abf2/areb <dig>  which functions in abiotic stress signalling and glucose response, is also expressed in embryonic axes in dry siliques  <cit> . overexpression of a phosphorylated active form of abf2/areb <dig> led to the activation of several seed storage protein genes in vegetative tissues, many of which also have binding sites for abi <dig>  another transcription factor involved in seed development  <cit> . however, none of the seed storage genes activated by the phosphorylated active form of abf2/areb <dig> were differentially expressed in the 35s:abf <dig> plants, nor were atem <dig> and atem <dig>  two lea-class genes that are abi <dig> targets expressed during seed maturation . this further demonstrates that overexpression of abf <dig>  while modifying patterns of gene expression, did not activate unintended pathways in response to drought stress in arabidopsis. this suggests that overexpression of a transcription factor to confer an abiotic stress tolerance trait may not necessarily produce unintended pleiotropic effects.

CONCLUSIONS
the cre/lox recombination system allowed us to create paired plant lines with identical t-dna insertion sites either with or without the abf <dig> transgene in order to eliminate position effects in our analysis of unintended effects. this approach also allowed us to examine unintended effects resulting from the expression of cre recombinase. we found that cre recombinase had a minimal impact on the transcriptome, which suggests that it produces few unintended effects in arabidopsis. microarray analysis of arabidopsis plants overexpressing abf <dig> demonstrated that the impact on the transcriptome is minimal. in the absence of drought stress, there were no differentially expressed genes. in response to drought stress, a reprogramming of the drought response was observed, suggestive of changes in the timing or strength of expression of some genes in 35s:abf <dig> plants. some of these changes may be directly related to the action of abf <dig> while others may reflect an altered physiological state as a result of the enhanced drought tolerance of 35s:abf <dig> plants. amongst the differentially expressed genes, no unintended pathways appeared to be activated as a result of abf <dig> overexpression. these results are significant because they demonstrate that plant responses to abiotic stresses such as drought may be strictly coordinated at multiple regulatory steps and this limits the extent of unintended pleiotropic effects. this demonstrates that engineering stress tolerance through manipulation of endogenous plant pathways may not necessarily produce unintended pleiotropic effects despite the complexity of such traits. this is an important finding for establishing the safety of such traits as they begin to enter the market in the near future.
