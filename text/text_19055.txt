BACKGROUND
worldwide, breast cancer remains one of the main causes of cancer-induced morbidity and mortality in women. breast tumors are usually classified according to clinical parameters  and molecular expression status   <cit> . such a classification allows clinicians ordering the appropriate treatment. for instance, er-positive/negative  status refers to the expression of the 66kda nuclear estrogen receptor α  in tumors, which are consequently cured by endocrine therapeutic agents such as tamoxifen. nevertheless, about 30 % therapeutic failure is observed due to unclear resistance mechanisms  <cit> .

until the recent identification of new membrane bound estrogen receptors, erα <dig> has been considered as the sole functional estrogen receptor in hormone sensitive breast tumor. in  <dig>  wang and colleagues  <cit>  cloned a 36-kda variant of er-alpha  which lacks both af- <dig> and af- <dig> transcription activation domains but retains a truncated ligand-binding domain, suggesting that erα <dig> may have a spectrum of ligand selectivity different from erα <dig> 

erα <dig> is generated from a promoter located in the first intron of the esr <dig> gene, indicating that erα <dig> expression is regulated independently from erα <dig>  this is consistent with the finding that erα <dig> protein is present in about 40 % of  and  breast tumors.

erα <dig> triggers membrane-initiated mitogenic estrogen signaling through non-genomic pathways not only in breast, but also in gastric and laryngeal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo . in the  mcf- <dig> breast tumor cell line, erα <dig> overexpression leads to tamoxifen resistance and enhances metastatic potential  <cit> . thus, tamoxifen does not act as a drug for cancer treatment but serves as an erα <dig> agonist, triggering proliferation, migration and invasion. the adverse effect of tamoxifen in erα <dig> highly expressing  breast tumors may explain why the affected patients display poor outcome and require chemotherapy but not endocrine therapy  <cit> .

these findings raise the possibility that, in vivo, enhanced erα <dig> expression could drive the growth status switch from estrogen dependent mitogenic signaling to estrogen dispensable migration/invasion ability and consequently stimulates cancer progression. therefore, we designed a generic method to validate the hypothesis that erα <dig> expression may serve as a reliable therapeutic response prognosis marker for breast cancer patients.

a retrospective study was performed on  <dig> breast tumor samples in which the expression of genes involved in non-genomic estrogen response as well as metastatic process was analyzed. potential relationship between these genes was modeled by using nonlinear correlation analyses, mutual information associated to significance analysis  <cit> , which are proven to be more accurate than linear statics techniques even if the latter are simpler to implement . these models are represented by so-called “gene co-regulation graphs” which can be drawn for any consistent subclass of the considered  <dig> samples. then, we used a metric comparing two gene co-regulation graphs to search the optimal value of erα <dig> expression providing two distinct populations from a gene network point of view. the two obtained graphs were compared and the differences appeared to be of biological significance.

RESULTS
 versus  gene networks
since breast tumors are usually classified according to their hormone receptor status, tumor samples were first split into two classes according to their respective  status, thus defining a first group of  <dig> erα <dig> expressing samples , and a second group of  <dig> samples devoid of erα <dig> expression .  breast cancer cell lines such as mcf- <dig> are considered non metastatic and weakly express erα <dig> whereas  cell lines such as mda-mb- <dig> or mda-mb- <dig> are highly metastatic and display higher levels of erα <dig> expression. in order to assess if such a link between erα <dig> expression level and metastatic ability may be observed in vivo, nuclear  or membrane-associated estrogen receptors , their counterparts in non-genomic estrogen signaling  as well as metastatic marker  mrna expression levels were determined by real-time pcr analyses. among the growing amount of biomarkers related to the er status , the migration/invasion process  or the estrogen-response pathways , those listed above were picked up because they were previously shown to be related to erα <dig> . then, we identified the gene networks for each class of tumors by using nonlinear correlation analyses and transfer entropy computation . the processed data obtained from  samples indicated that erα <dig> was a key node of a complex gene network, which involves other steroid and growth factor receptors as well as metastatic markers as a whole . on the other hand, erα <dig> was connected to the single metastatic marker vim in the  network . these huge differences displayed by the two networks implied different functioning modes according to the tumor  status and suggested that there could be a quantifiable link between erα <dig> position into the network and/or its expression level and tumor metastatic progression.fig.  <dig> gene expression network modeling in  and  samples. graphs were designed by computing nonlinear correlation and mutual information between each gene expression pair in either er-positive  or er-negative  samples. the vertices represent genes. the edges linking the vertices indicate that independence between gene expressions is less than  <dig>  and links for erα <dig> are in bold. p-values are given in additional file 1: table s1a and additional file 2: table s1b, respectively



erα <dig> based classification of breast tumor samples
to check if erα <dig> mrna expression level could be a relevant classifier of a particular breast tumor phenotype, we drew a gene network for each erα <dig> expression value. then, we quantified the differences between the networks as a function of erα <dig> relative expression, and designed a metric playing the role of a distance between graphs. the metric is an integer number standing for the structural differences between two graphs. more precisely, we compared the edges in the two graphs: when an edge existed in a graph and not in the other the distance was incremented with  <dig>  if the edge existed in both graphs but did not represent the same linking way, the distance was incremented with  <dig>  the obtained distance is then a metric.

according to this metric, we determined the best threshold for erα <dig> to subdivide the samples into two populations, in order to obtain the most different networks probably defining the most different tumor phenotypes related to erα <dig> expression . among erα <dig> expressing samples, the “best” threshold  was Δc  =  <dig>  and allowed to segregate a high erα <dig> expressing class  of  <dig> tumors and a low erα <dig> expressing class  of  <dig> tumors.fig.  <dig> gene expression network modeling depending on erα <dig> expression level. a network distance characterization as a function of erα <dig> expression level . expression level varied between  <dig> and  <dig> in the samples expressing erα <dig> . with step of  <dig>  on erα <dig> expression level, population was divided into two sub-groups for which networks were computed. a distance between corresponding networks was calculated . the erα <dig> expression threshold corresponding to the most different gene networks was computed and was equal to  <dig> . b–c graphs were designed by computing nonlinear correlation and mutual information between each gene expression pair in either low erα <dig>  expressing  or high erα <dig>  expressing  samples. the vertices represent genes. the edges linking the vertices indicate that independence between gene expressions is less than  <dig> . positive correlations are in blue and negative correlations in red. correlation values are given in additional file 3: table s2a and additional file 4: table s2b and p-values in additional file 5: table s3a and additional file 6: table s3b, respectively



erα <dig> and metastatic progression
in a last step, the previous modeling procedure was applied to either  or  subgroups. when erα <dig> expression was low , it was clearly related to other receptors  and ddb <dig> as well as inversely correlated to metastatic markers  . conversely, in the context of a high erα <dig> expression , the network indicated a positive relationship to metastatic markers  independent from other receptors .

discussion
in the present study, we examined erα <dig> expression in breast tumor specimens from  <dig> patients. we report that the majority of  tumors also express high levels of erα <dig> 

in a previous clinical study, erα <dig> expression was shown to correlate with poor outcome in patients with  tumors treated by tamoxifen and the same tendency was observed in patients with  tumors  <cit> . therefore, a high level of erα <dig> expression seemed to be an unfavorable factor of survival in breast cancer patients, independently of er status. besides, recent in vitro data indicate that erα <dig> expression  controls metastatic potential in  hcc <dig> cells and  confers estrogen-hypersensitivity to  mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . in order to confirm that erα <dig> can trigger the progression of breast cancer in the primary tumor as well as during metastasis and to characterize the underlying mechanisms of high erα36-dependent phenotypes, we developed modeling tools. expression analyses and network modeling of estrogen and growth factor receptor encoding genes, well known markers involved in tumor cell migration or invasion, and selected erα <dig> target genes  <cit>  suggest that erα <dig> could be a key node of estrogen responsive pro-metastatic gene network in  tumors. these results are in line with recent in vitro analyses in mcf- <dig> cells, which show that the activation of erα <dig> expression triggers adaptive changes characterized by enhanced survival and migration during acquired tamoxifen resistance process  <cit> . similar data were obtained from endometrial cancer cells wherein erα <dig> was shown to promote tamoxifen agonist action via the mapk/erk and pi3k/akt pathways . taken together, our results and others clearly suggest that  tumors highly expressing erα <dig> should not be cured by tamoxifen because the treatment could drive metastatic progression.

the developed approach to validate erα <dig> as relevant prognostic marker is quite generic and can be applied to other genes as well as to a subset of genes g <dig>  indeed, the only modification, in this case, is to consider that we search for the maxima of multivariable function. then, a classification can be done according to the expression of each gene to obtain 2n classes, where n is the cardinality of the considered subset g <dig>  moreover, the robustness of the proposed method is attested by the fact that we proceed as described in  <cit> , by using a shuffling method which generates more than  <dig>  <dig> data for each of the dependency computation done between each pair of the studied genes.

among the genes tested in this study, erα <dig> was identified as the best classifier candidate based on its ability to discriminate between two separate networks: one connecting erα <dig> to membrane receptors and the second relating erα <dig> expression to those of metastatic markers. therefore, comprehensive analysis and modeling of gene expression combined to colocalization analysis of erα <dig> and erα <dig> in breast tumors will contribute to characterize the cascade and timing of events that trigger erα <dig> expression during  metastatic tumor progression.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study  identifies erα <dig> as a relevant classifier whose expression level should be taken into account for breast tumors clinical characterization and  tumor treatment orientation,  confirms ex vivo previous in vitro data connecting high erα <dig> expression to enhanced expression of migration/invasion markers and  generates a novel approach for the rapid, cheap and relevant evaluation of any candidate gene expression as a predictor of a complex biological process.
