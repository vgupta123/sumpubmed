BACKGROUND
the genus arcobacter is a member of the gram-negative, ε-proteobacterial subdivision. the majority of isolated arcobacters belong to one of three species: arcobacter butzleri, a. cryaerophilus or a. skirrowii. additional members of this taxon include: a. cibarius, isolated from broiler carcasses  <cit> ; a. nitrofigilis, a nitrogen-fixing organism isolated originally from estuarine plant roots  <cit> ; a. halophilus, isolated from a hypersaline lagoon  <cit> ; candidatus arcobacter sulfidicus, a sulfide-oxidizing marine organism  <cit> ; a. mytili sp. nov., isolated from mussels  <cit> ; a. thereius sp. nov, isolated from pigs and ducks  <cit>  and a. marinus sp. nov  <cit> . arcobacter butzleri, a. cryaerophilus, a. skirrowii and a. cibarius have been isolated often from both animals  <cit>  and food sources  <cit> , water and agricultural runoff  <cit> , and domestic pets  <cit> .

the prevalence of arcobacters in food, raw milk and water would suggest a potential for food- or water-borne arcobacter-associated human illness. arcobacter spp., primarily a. butzleri and a. cryaerophilus, have been isolated from human diarrheal stool samples  <cit> . however, no direct connection between consumption of arcobacter-contaminated food or water and human illness has been established, although it is likely that transmission of arcobacters occur via these routes. arcobacter spp. have been isolated also from the stools of healthy humans  <cit> . thus, while host predispositions such as age and immune status may play a role, it is possible that some a. butzleri and a. cryaerophilus strains are non-pathogenic and are human commensals. the presence of a subset of non-pathogenic strains alongside pathogenic strains within a. butzleri, a. cryaerophilus and perhaps the other food- and water-associated arcobacter species, such as a. skirrowii and a. cibarius, would indicate a need for an accurate typing method to distinguish human-pathogenic and human-commensal arcobacters. arcobacter typing methodology would also be useful in studies of transmission routes and source tracking during outbreak and extended epidemiological investigations. typing of arcobacter strains using such methods as enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus -pcr, pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and amplified fragment length polymorphism  analysis has been reported .

multilocus sequence typing , a typing method based on partial, yet defined, sequence information at seven housekeeping loci, was developed first within the ε-proteobacteria for c. jejuni  <cit> . it has proven useful for strain characterization, lineage identification and c. jejuni epidemiology . within campylobacter, mlst methods are available also for c. coli  <cit> , c. lari  <cit> , c. upsaliensis  <cit> , c. helveticus  <cit> , c. fetus  <cit>  and c. insulaenigrae  <cit> . the existence of multiple mlst methods within a genus provides insights into much broader areas, such as the degree of horizontal gene transfer between species and bacterial evolution and speciation within a genus; mlst can provide additional, clarifying genotypic information for a novel or potentially novel species  <cit> . development of the non-jejuni campylobacter mlst methods was assisted by the availability of draft c. coli, c. lari and c. upsaliensis genomes  <cit> . construction of degenerate primer sets, based on alignments of these genome sequences at the seven mlst loci, permitted extension of the mlst methods into two species, c. insulaenigrae and c. helveticus, for which no genomic information existed  <cit> . similarly, the existence of the recently completed a. butzleri strain rm <dig> genome  <cit> , as well as a draft genome of a. halophilus strain la31b , provided useful information for the development of an mlst method suitable for typing of arcobacter species.

here, we describe a new mlst method for multiple arcobacter species, including the three most frequently-isolated arcobacter spp., a. butzleri, a. cryaerophilus and a. skirrowii. the arcobacter mlst gene set is identical to the c. jejuni gene set , glna, glta, glya, pgm and tkt), permitting phylogenetic comparison of data across the two genera. a sample set of  <dig> isolates of diverse geographic origin and source was typed in this study. almost  <dig> sequence types and  <dig> alleles across seven loci were identified.

RESULTS
design of the arcobacter multilocus sequence typing method
in order to optimize cross-species and cross-genus comparisons, the four genes , glna, glya and tkt) common to the campylobacter mlst methods described previously  <cit> , together with the three additional loci  present within the c. jejuni method  <cit> , were targeted in the arcobacter mlst method. for optimal phylogenetic comparison, the same allelic endpoints were considered. development of the arcobacter mlst method was assisted by the concurrent completion of the a. butzleri strain rm <dig> genome sequence  <cit> . gene sequences for the seven c. jejuni mlst loci were extracted, where applicable, from the existing arcobacter and thermotolerant campylobacter genome sequences, and aligned. degenerate primers, situated approximately  <dig> bp upstream and downstream from the allelic endpoints, were designed and  <dig> arcobacter strains  were amplified and sequenced. sequence information from this sample set was aligned and used to construct the butzleri-specific primers listed in table s <dig> . for the non-butzleri species, some loci did not amplify efficiently, using primers based on the campylobacter/arcobacter alignments. for these loci, improved primer pairs were constructed by incorporating sequences from the draft a. halophilus genome  into the campylobacter/arcobacter alignments. these improved primer pairs efficiently amplified the seven mlst loci  of a. cryaerophilus and a. skirrowii .

initial typing of the arcobacter sample set at the glya locus resulted in mixed sequencing reads for some strains, suggesting that at least two glya genes might be present. the presence of multiple glya genes was confirmed later upon completion of the a. butzleri strain rm <dig> genome  <cit> . in this strain, two nearly-identical, complete glya genes are present in the genome, one  linked to lyss and the other  to ada. therefore, to eliminate generation of mixed traces, amplification primers were designed within the lyss and ada genes. pcrs using the lyss and glya reverse primers amplified specifically glya <dig> and pcrs using the ada and glya forward primers amplified specifically glya <dig>  all arcobacter isolates typed in this study contained at least two glya genes, suggesting that the presence of multiple glya genes is an unusual feature common to the genus. the glya locus in other campylobacter mlst methods is also linked to lyss. for this reason, and for the fact that the glya <dig> locus is less discriminatory than glya <dig> , the lyss-linked glya <dig> locus was incorporated into the arcobacter typing method.

arcobacter strain characterization
to address the ability of the arcobacter mlst method to amplify successfully as many a. butzleri strains as possible, we wanted a large sample set with broad geographic origins and sources. a description of the arcobacter isolates by geographic origin and source is listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  a total of  <dig> a. butzleri isolates were typed, as well as an additional  <dig> isolates representing other arcobacter species, e.g. a. cryaerophilus and a. skirrowii . all  <dig> a. butzleri, a. cryaerophilus, a. skirrowii and a. thereius isolates amplified and sequenced successfully with one or more of the primer pairs listed in table s <dig> . arcobacter cibarius demonstrated variable tkt amplification results, i.e. weak amplification of some loci with each primer pair and no primer pair amplifying all loci .

genetic diversity of the arcobacter mlst loci
a large number of arcobacter mlst alleles and sequence types  were identified in this study . allelic density  ranged from approximately 30%  at the glna locus to 63%  at the glya <dig> locus. the high density of alleles translated also into a large number of sts . among the  <dig> a. butzleri isolates characterized in this study,  <dig> sts were identified. in fact, among all of the arcobacter sts, no more than five strains were determined to possess the same st and  <dig> of  <dig> strains  contained unique sts. a large percentage of variable sites were identified at all of the arcobacter mlst loci . arcobacter cryaerophilus and a. skirrowii strains contained the highest number of variable sites per locus, relative to the number of alleles identified, and the largest number of variable sites for all species occurred at the glya and/or pgm loci.

b. ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous sites.

c. an additional  <dig> and  <dig> variable sites are present within the aspa and glna loci, respectively, when a. skirrowii st- <dig> is included in the calculations.

the identification of mlst alleles associated with particular food animal sources was first described in c. coli  <cit> . however, analysis of the a. butzleri and a. cryaerophilus mlst alleles and sts revealed no apparent host-association. additionally, phylogenetic analysis of a. butzleri and a. cryaerophilus alleles and sts did not identify any clusters or groups associated with geographic origin

the dn/ds ratio  was substantially <  <dig> for all of the mlst loci characterized in this study , ranging from  <dig>  at a. butzleri glta to  <dig>  at a. skirrowii tkt. these low values for the arcobacter mlst loci are consistent with those described previously for campylobacter  <cit> , indicating that those loci in both genera are not subject to positive selection.

the presence of a large number of mlst alleles within the arcobacter sample set might indicate that the arcobacter mlst alleles are genetically unstable, prone to change either by accumulation of point mutations or horizontal gene transfer. four a. butzleri type strain isolates, obtained from different labs and including the genome sequence strain rm <dig>  were typed in this study. in addition,  <dig> related strains, isolated after passage of the a. butzleri type strain through swine, were also typed. as expected, all  <dig> strains were the same sequence type, st- <dig>  and contained the same glya <dig> allele , suggesting that a. butzleri sts are relatively stable, even after passage through a food animal.

association of arcobacter alleles and sts with species and subgroups
within each of the aspa, atpa, glna, glta, pgm and tkt loci, phylogenetically discrete clusters were identified that associated with species . an example is illustrated in figure 1a for the atp locus, showing that the a. butzleri, a. skirrowii, a. thereius and a. cryaerophilus alleles form distinct groups. however, for the latter species two separate clusters, termed here 'group 1' and 'group 2' were observed. two phylogenetically-distinct clusters of a. cryaerophilus alleles were identified also at the glna, glta, pgm and tkt loci , but not at the aspa locus that formed only one cluster. the existence of species-associated clustering at these six loci permits tentative identification of lateral transfer events. these events were not observed in a. butzleri because no alleles related phylogenetically to other species were identified, however, alleles related phylogenetically to those identified in a. butzleri were identified within a. cibarius and a. skirrowii . similarly, a. skirrowii alleles were identified within a. cryaerophilus and a. thereius , and an a. thereius allele was identified in a. cryaerophilus . lateral transfer events identified by mlst have been reported previously  <cit> .

clustering of the glya alleles  is noticeably different from clustering at the other six loci . here, as at the other six loci, the a. butzleri and a. thereius glya alleles form separate clusters distinct from the alleles of the other characterized arcobacters. however, the glya alleles of a. cryaerophilus and a. skirrowii are indistinguishable phylogenetically, with the a. cibarius glya alleles forming a deep branch within the a. cryaerophilus/a. skirrowii cluster. additionally, the a. cryaerophilus/a. skirrowii glya cluster is highly divergent, relative to the a. cryaerophilus and a. skirrowii clusters at the other mlst loci.

phylogenetic analysis of the arcobacter sts, following clustal alignment of the concatenated allele sequences for each unique profile, indicated that these sts clustered also by species . arcobacter thereius profiles formed a clade distinct from a. skirrowii and the other arcobacter species, providing additional evidence that the strains within this clade are exemplars of a novel arcobacter species. two groups of a. cryaerophilus profiles were observed: 'group 1' and 'group 2' profiles were composed primarily of 'group 1' and 'group 2' mlst alleles, respectively. based on sds-page analysis of whole-cell protein extracts and 16s restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, two subgroups within a. cryaerophilus were identified by kiehlbauch et al. and vandamme et al.  <cit> . these a. cryaerophilus subgroups differ also in their fatty-acid composition, specifically in the amounts of 16: <dig> cis  <dig> and 16: <dig> trans  <dig> fatty acids  <cit> , and in their aflp profiles  <cit> , although they are not differentiated by dna:dna hybridization analysis  <cit> . only  <dig> of the  <dig> a. cryaerophilus strains in this study were characterized previously at the subgroup level by either aflp or whole protein profiling . however, the subgroup identities of these strains did not correlate well with the mlst groups. considering these results, it is possible that the cryaerophilus subgroups identified by vandamme et al.  <cit>  are not analogous to the mlst groups identified here, although additional investigations will be necessary to resolve this issue.

the arcobacter glya <dig> and glya <dig> loci
as described above, arcobacter strains contain two unlinked glya genes in their genomes. the ada-linked glya <dig> alleles are less discriminatory than the lyss-linked glya <dig> alleles: incorporation of glya <dig> into the typing scheme in place of glya <dig> would result in  <dig> sts for a butzleri, instead of  <dig>  and  <dig> sts for a. cryaerophilus, instead of  <dig>  therefore, this reduced level of discrimination was one of the reasons why the ada-linked glya <dig> locus was not incorporated into the arcobacter mlst method. additionally, inclusion of both glya loci in the arcobacter mlst method, thus creating an eight-locus typing scheme, would not increase significantly the discriminatory power of the seven locus method. a large number of sts contain different glya <dig> and glya <dig> alleles: for example, the a. butzleri genome sequence strain rm <dig> contains the glya- <dig> allele at the glya <dig> locus and glya- <dig> at the glya <dig> locus .

the presence of two highly-similar glya loci is an unusual feature of the arcobacter genomes and multiple copy genes are not generally members of mlst schemes. however, the data suggest that despite the presence of two glya loci within every strain, the arcobacter glya loci are remarkably stable. there is no compelling evidence in this study  of gene conversion events between the two glya genes , and only one putative lateral transfer event was identified at glya. therefore, inclusion of glya <dig> in the typing scheme is merited, since the large number of glya alleles identified in this study would substantially enhance arcobacter strain discrimination.

CONCLUSIONS
the large number of mlst alleles and sts identified in this study indicates that the arcobacter mlst method described here is useful for strain discrimination for the three major arcobacter species, i.e. a. butzleri, a. cryaerophilus and a. skirrowii, as well as two additional arcobacter species, a. thereius and a. cibarius. additional genomic sequence data should permit revision and expansion of this typing method into additional arcobacter species. no association, with either host or geographical source, of arcobacter alleles or sts was observed in this study; however, the large suite of alleles and sts present within this sample set make identification of such associations difficult, since most alleles and sts were observed infrequently. typing of additional arcobacter isolates, thereby increasing potentially the numbers of each allele and st, may reveal heretofore undetected association patterns within this genus. the increasing association of arcobacters with human illness, transmitted potentially by contaminated food or water, makes this method a valuable addition to arcobacter typing. this method should prove useful in investigations of sporadic and outbreak arcobacterioses and arcobacter epidemiology.
