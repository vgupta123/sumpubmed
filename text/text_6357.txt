BACKGROUND
the human and mouse genome sequencing projects revealed that 99% of human genes have a homolog or an ortholog in mouse, with an average of 88% conservation in the coding sequence  <cit> . this suggests that other factors must contribute to the phenotypic differences between human and mouse. gene duplication and alternative splicing are two fundamental mechanisms that shape genome evolution. alternative splicing acts at the level of mrna processing, whereas gene duplication affects genomic dna. gene duplication can also operate at the level of rna via retroposition, which has been shown to generate functional intronless duplicates of entire genes  <cit> . the contributions of these two processes to the proteome variability are substantially different  <cit> .

duplication of existing genes is an important mechanism for generating new genes while maintaining the original  <cit> . gene duplication gives rise to a state of genetic redundancy, in which one of the newly formed gene copies enters a period of reduced evolutionary pressure, allowing entirely novel functional patterns to emerge. selective constraints ensure that one of the duplicates retains its original function but the second copy is free from these constraints and, thus, accumulates mutations. these mutations can lead to a non-functional pseudogene that may continue  to be expressed at the rna level; eventually the pseudogene accumulates further mutations that inactivate its transcription  <cit> . alternatively, the mutations may lead to a different expression pattern or to neo-functionalization that advances organism speciation  <cit> . neo-functionalization of duplicated genes was previously attributed to amino acid sequence changes through sporadic mutations or through changes in gene expression patterns  <cit> . indeed, in plants whole genome duplication is associated with speciation  <cit> .

an average human gene is  <dig>  nucleotides long and consists of  <dig>  exons of ~ <dig> nucleotides each  that are separated by  <dig>  introns  <cit> . rna splicing is the process in which introns are removed and exons are joined together to form a mature mrna. rna splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, which is comprised of more than  <dig> proteins and five snrnps, called u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  <cit> . alternative splicing generates multiple mrna products from a single gene, contributing to transcriptome and proteome diversity. alternative splicing is a possible mechanism for bridging the gap between the gene count in an organism's genome and its level of phenotypic complexity  <cit> . up-to-date estimates suggest that more than 60% of human genes undergo alternative splicing  <cit> . about 80% of alternative splicing events change the encoded protein and ~15% of genetic diseases are caused by mutations within splicing regulatory elements  <cit> . there are four types of alternative splicing alternative 5' splice or 3' splice site selection, exon skipping, and intron retention. selection of previously un-used splice sites can result in creation of a new exon, which is alternatively spliced. exonization is essentially a birthing process of new exons from intronic sequences.

in human, most of newly generated exons originate from the primate-specific transposed element, alu. repetitive dna sequences are found in most organisms and, in some, constitute a substantial fraction of the entire genome . various types of repetitive dna sequences are found within mammalian genomes and have contributed to mammalian evolution  <cit> . the alu sequences are short interspersed elements  of about  <dig> nucleotides in length, which are unique to primates  <cit> . over the past  <dig> million years, the alu sequence has been amplified via an rna-mediated transposition process to a copy number of  <dig>  million, comprising an estimated 10% of the human genome  <cit> .

seven hundred thousand alu elements exist within intronic sequences; of these,  <dig>  are found within introns of protein coding genes, in both sense and antisense orientations with respect to the mrna precursor  <cit> . the alu element in the antisense orientation contains most of the characteristics required for identification as an exon by the splicing machinery. alu exonization is an evolutionary pathway that generates primate-specific transcriptomic diversity  <cit> .

recent studies that examined the evolutionary trend of alternative splicing after gene duplication revealed that duplicate genes have fewer alternatively spliced forms than single-copy genes  and that an inverse correlation exists between the mean number of alternative splice forms and the gene family size  <cit> . these results suggest that there is a loss of alternative splicing in duplicated genes after the duplication and that there is an asymmetric evolution of alternative splicing after gene duplication  <cit> . it seems that the duplication event compensates for a reduced use of alternative splicing and that gene duplication and alternative splicing do not evolve independently  <cit> .

in this study, we compared the level of de novo exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes with the level in singletons. we employed a whole-genome bioinformatic analysis, supported by in vivo analysis, to examine whether duplicated genes exhibited a lower level of selection against exonization of transposed elements . the results suggest that alternatively spliced exons that originate from exonization of transposed elements are found significantly more frequently in duplicated genes than in singletons. in one of these genes, tif-ia, the te in one of the duplicates, but not in the original, is exonized. we identified the point mutation leading to the exonization. when this mutation was inserted into the original gene, it caused exonization that substantially reduced production of the protein-coding mrna. this implies that there was selection against exonization in the original gene, whereas the duplicate was free from such constraints. the exonization in the duplicated gene occurs in some leukemia cells, but not in normal cells, implying that changes in activity or concentration of splicing factors  <cit>  within leukemia cells changes exon/intron recognition.

RESULTS
transposed elements more likely to be exonized in duplicated genes
duplicated genes undergo relaxation of selective pressure following duplication. the increase in mutational rate leads to changes in the mrna sequence in the duplicated gene relative to the original  <cit> . in this study, we investigated whether the relaxation in selective pressure also leads to an increase in exonization of tes in duplicate genes compared with singletons. for this purpose, we compiled a dataset of exons resulting from te exonizations within the human genome  <cit> . these exons were divided into two groups: those that reside within duplicated genes and those that reside within singletons. our dataset of te exonizations contains  <dig> exons in  <dig> different genes. we found  <dig> alu exons in  <dig> duplicated genes,  <dig> mir  exons in  <dig> duplicated genes,  <dig> l <dig>  exons in  <dig> duplicated genes, three l <dig>  exons in three duplicated genes,  <dig> ltr  exons in  <dig> genes, and three dna exons in three genes. overall, we identified  <dig> te exons in  <dig> duplicated genes, that is, an average of  <dig>  te exons per gene . all other te exons  reside in  <dig> genes, that is, an average of  <dig>  exons per gene. the exonization rate within duplicated genes was significantly higher than that in singletons .

are these te exonizations within duplicated genes part of a neo-functionalization or a non-functionalization process? apparently, both trajectories are present within our dataset. an example for neo-functionalization is the primate-specific duplication of the gene gon4l that generated the duplicated gene yy1ap <dig>  <cit> . the gene yy1ap <dig> is functional and also has a new role as a co-activator, yy1; it also has different levels of expression within human tissue relative to its duplicate  <cit> . our exonization analysis revealed that yy1ap <dig> contains two different alu exonizations that do not exist within gon4l. one of the exonizations results from the alu that was inserted prior to the gene duplication. the other resulted from an insertion of an alu element after the duplication and subsequent exonization  <cit> .

an example of non-functionalization and subsequent pseudogenesis is found in the duplication of the ncf <dig> gene. ncf <dig> is one of the genes responsible for the chronic granulomatous disease  and also contributes to autoimmunity  <cit> . in human, the gene underwent triplication, the two duplicates are well characterized  <cit> . our analysis of te exonization revealed that there was an alu exonization within the second intron of each of the two pseudogenes. there is no evidence for this exonization within the functional gene, even though the alu element is present within the intron of the functional gene as well. our dataset contains both exonization of tes that were inserted prior to gene duplication and those that were inserted after gene duplication. two of the alu exonizations in duplicated genes in our dataset were shown to be associated with cancerous tissues based on the tissue origin of their ests  <cit> ; the alu exonization within intron  <dig> of the gene yy1ap <dig>  the aforementioned duplicate of the gene gon4l  <cit> ; and alu exonization within intron  <dig> of the gene acad <dig>  a paralog of acadvl .

tif-ia gene underwent a hominidae-specific triplication
one of the genes from our bioinformatic analysis is transcription initiation factor ia . this transcription initiation factor directs growth-dependent regulation of rna polymerase i. it is a 75-kda protein and levels, or activity, fluctuate in response to cell proliferation  <cit> . genetic inactivation of the transcription factor tif-ia leads to nucleolar disruption, cell cycle arrest, and p53-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, tif-ia is a key protein in adapting cellular biosynthetic activities to cell growth  <cit> .

the gene that encodes tif-ia is highly conserved from yeast to human and is essential for cell survival. alignment of the human cdna of tif-ia against the human genome using blat  revealed two imperfect copies of tif-ia, which presumably resulted from gene duplication. the original copy of tif-ia gene , as well as the two duplicates , are located on chromosome  <dig>  in addition, a processed pseudo-gene of tif-ia is located on chromosome  <dig>  but is not transcribed according to est data.

the two duplicates of the gene were probably generated in a sequential manner, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  non-homologous recombination was probably the mechanism for the triplication, because all the copies are on the same chromosome. in detail, the original gene from locus  <dig> was duplicated almost completely, except for the last exon , to locus  <dig>  next, a major deletion of  <dig>  bp within the duplicate, which included exons  <dig> and  <dig>  occurred. then, locus  <dig> was duplicated to locus  <dig>  this duplication was also incomplete, resulting loss of the last three exons . the deletion was confirmed experimentally .

blat of human mrna on the chimpanzee genome suggests that it also contains more than one copy of tif-ia gene. the original gene is located on chromosome  <dig>  as it is in the human genome. there are several regions of homology to tif-ia on chromosome  <dig> , as well as a processed pseudogene on chromosome 2b. it was difficult to determine the order and pattern of duplication events in the chimpanzee genome due to incomplete sequencing and the low level of genome assembly; however, it is clear that the chimp genome contains more than one copy of the tif-ia gene on the same chromosome.

alignment of tif-ia cdna with the rhesus genome revealed the presence of the original copy of the gene on chromosome  <dig> and the processed pseudogene on chromosome  <dig>  but no duplications. similar analysis on other vertebrate genomes  and non-vertebrate organisms  revealed that each had only a single copy of tif-ia gene. therefore, we concluded that the duplication of tif-ia gene occurred after the human-chimp-rhesus split but before the human-chimp split between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago.

alu insertion in the first intron of tif-ia
examination of the tif-ia genes revealed another intriguing event: an alu element was inserted into the first intron of the common ancestor of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus . this alu was inserted into another transposed element called l <dig>  located in intron  <dig> of the tif-ia gene. we reconstructed this scenario by examination of intron  <dig> of the tif-ia gene in other mammals. the l <dig> element was present in all sequenced mammals except opossum. the insertion of the alu element into the l <dig> transposed element led to an exonization in human. based on alignment of ests to the human genome , the 3' splice site  is donated by the l <dig> transposed element and two alternative 5' splice site  are selected, one donated by the alu sequence and the other by l <dig>  we designated the distal 5'ss, located in the alu sequence as 5'ss-a, and the proximal 5'ss, located in the l <dig> element, as 5'ss-b . the overall steps that lead to the exonization of that exon were as follows:  during primate evolution, an alu-sx element was inserted into an l <dig> retrotransposon of the line family.  the sequence accumulated mutations that caused exonization, leading to selection of three different isoforms as demonstrated in figure 2a. this exon is termed l2-aex.

transcription and translation of the wild-type and duplicate tif-ia genes
to examine whether the duplicates in the human genome are active transcriptionally, we examined the putative promoter regions of all three loci . the region of  <dig> kb upstream of the translation start codon of locus  <dig> has  <dig> % identity to the corresponding upstream region of locus  <dig>  the 1-kb promoter region of locus  <dig> shows similarity to that of locus 15; however, this putative promoter contains a deletion of  <dig> bp that ends at position - <dig> upstream of the potential translation start codon.

the many changes that occurred between the wild-type gene and the two duplicates suggest that the duplicates are not under selective pressure to encode functional protein. translation of the mrna produced from the original tif-ia gene results in a 651-aa protein with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. the duplicate at locus  <dig> potentially encodes a 514-aa polypeptide chain, whereas the duplicate at locus  <dig> potentially encodes a 39-aa polypeptide using the genuine start codon or a 106-aa polypeptide chain using the third atg downstream of the transcription start site . polypeptides of sizes expected from the duplicate loci were not detected by western blotting analysis with polyclonal antibodies to the wild-type tif-ia protein . although proteins do not appear to be generated from the duplicate genes, these duplicates are active transcriptionally as indicated by ests that derive from these loci. in addition, we measured the relative mrna levels based on nucleotide variation at certain positions between the loci. in p <dig> cells, mrna from the wild-type gene comprises about 80% of the mrna transcribed from the three loci and locus  <dig> and locus  <dig> constitute 3% and 17% of the mrna, respectively .

alu-exonization is exclusive to the tif-ia duplicate in locus 21
est analysis revealed that a large fraction of the l2-aex-containing ests originated from carcinogenic tissues, such as burkitt's lymphomas . to examine the splicing patterns of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the wild-type gene and the two duplicates, we designed a pair of primers to sequences in the flanking exons:  <dig> and  <dig> that are conserved among all three loci, meaning all three copies will be amplified simultaneously. we then performed rt-pcr analysis of human cdna from normal tissues and from transformed cell lines. the major mrna product from the tif-ia genes in most of normal tissues skips the alu exon and shows either no exonization or a negligible level of exonization . in two cell lines, 293t and bj- <dig>  there was a substantial level of exonization . these results imply that, for most of the tested cells, the exonization is a minor or non-existent event. we did not detect any exonization of l2-aex within chimpanzee blood cells, implying that this exonization may be human specific .

next, we examined the exonization in  <dig> leukemia cell lines by rt-pcr analysis and detected a high level of exonization of both the short and long exonized form in  <dig> out of the  <dig> cell lines . to specifically identify the locus from which this exonization occurred, we designed loci-specific primers and repeated the rt-pcr analysis using the pair of primers that detects all three loci and the locus-specific pairs of primers . only locus  <dig> showed exonization in which 5'ss-a or of 5'ss-b or both were selected and the ratio among the three isoforms varied significantly among the cell lines. thus, there was a low level or an absence of exonization in normal human tissues and in epithelial cancer cell lines. in contrast, most leukemia cell lines exhibited a high level of exonization. the exonization was restricted to one of the duplicates , but not to the original gene . the cells that show exonization do not exhibit a known common characteristic, such as a specific hematopoietic lineage or mutations in a certain pathway or gene that can explain the exonization in these cells but not in the others. these results imply that there is a certain level of transcriptomic instability of the tif-ia locus in certain cancer cells, in particular leukemic. the definition of exon/intron is abnormal for the tif-ia locus, and perhaps other loci as well, in these cancer cells; what is defined as an intron for normal tissues is selected as an exon in leukemic cells.

the wild-type tif-ia gene is one step away from exonization
to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to exonization in locus  <dig>  but not in loci  <dig> and  <dig>  we compared the genomic sequence of the l2-alu among the loci . many point mutations have accumulated in the l2-alu genomic sequence following the duplication event. one of these mutations was of particular interest, because it changed a gag found in locus  <dig> and  <dig> to cag in locus  <dig>  this cag is used as the 3'ss of the l2-aex. gag is a week 3'ss, whereas cag is a strong one  <cit> . we, thus, hypothesized that this mutation leads to locus 21-specific exonization.

to examine this hypothesis, we cloned a mini-gene containing the human genomic dna from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> of locus  <dig> . the mini-gene was transfected into human 293t cells, rna was extracted, and the splicing pattern between exon  <dig> and  <dig> was examined by rt-pcr analysis using primers that are specific to the mini-gene mrna. as expected the wt mini-gene does not exhibit alu-exonization . however, a single point mutation at position - <dig>  at the putative 3'ss activated the exonization . the predominant mrna generated following this mutation is the one that includes the l2-aexs , leading to a low level of the normal mrna. in addition, the 3'ss mutation also generated an intron retention isoform. this indicates that the l2-alu in the wild-type gene  is one mutation away from exonization. if such a mutation were to occur, it would terminate production of a normal tif-ia protein in the cells almost completely, because the l2-aex inserts a premature stop codon.

we next evaluated the effect of 5'ss strength on exonization. strengthening of the either of the two sites did not activate the exonization  and neither did strengthening both . when the 3'ss is functional, the selection of 5'ss-a or 5'ss-b is determined by their relative strength . overall, these results indicate that the l2-alu element in the wt tif-ia gene is on the edge of exonization and that a single point mutation from g to c in position - <dig> of the putative 3'ss leads to exonization.

next, we examined which nucleotides in position - <dig> of the 3'ss would activate exonization. we mutated the 3'ss from gag to cag, tag, and aag . only the mutation from g to c at position - <dig> lead to exonization: the mutations to a and t did not. these results support our previous observation that cag is the strongest 3'ss  <cit> . also, the results show that alternative splicing is delicately balanced and is partially controlled by the strength of the 3' and 5'ss signals.

alternative splicing is often regulated in a tissue-specific or developmental-stage-specific manner. a common explanation for differential splicing patterns is that the concentrations of splicing regulatory proteins vary depending on tissue type and developmental stage. therefore, we examined the effect of different cellular environments on the splicing of the tif-ia mini-gene by transfection into different cell lines; we used the mini-gene containing the g-to-c mutant at position - <dig> of the 3'ss. the patterns of splicing observed depended on the cell line . in two cell lines, du <dig> and pc <dig>  the introns were not always excised  and in u2os, ht <dig>  hepg <dig>  hela, and 293t cell lines, the alternatively spliced mrna containing l2-aex was the predominant isoform . these findings show that, for this tif-ia mini-gene, the cellular environment regulates the level of exonization and intron/exon recognition.

alu-exonization in yy1ap, the duplicate of gon4lb
to further support the bioinformatics analysis we demonstrated another case of a gene that underwent a duplication event, and the duplicate gene exhibits a distinct alternative splicing pattern originated from an intronic alu element, which also exist in the ancestor gene, but is not exonized. figure  <dig> demonstrates the genomic structure of the original gon4lb gene compared to the duplicated gene, yy1ap <dig>  <cit> . an intronic alu element is exonized between exons  <dig> and  <dig> . aligning the alu element in both original and duplicated genes uncovers many sequence changes between them . in contrast to the tif-ia gene, no mutation was detected in the splice signals, thus we assume that the reason for exonization in the duplicated gene and not in the original gon4lb gene is due to mutations in regulatory sequences such as esrs  <cit> . figure 5c examines the splicing pattern of the corresponding genomic region and revealed that the alu element in gon4lb gene is not exonized while the duplicated gene  exhibits low levels of exonization. when the alu-exon enters into the mature rna of yy1ap <dig>  it inserts a pre-mature termination codon   <cit> . this strengthened our bioinformatics analysis showing a second example of exonization that is found in the duplicated gene and not in the original copy.

discussion
gene duplication and alternative splicing are two mechanisms that enhance genome and transcriptome complexity. gene duplication works at the level of dna and alternative splicing at the level of mrna. these two processes are seemingly independent, but recent comprehensive bioinformatics analyses suggest that they are correlated inversely  <cit> . that is, certain genes proliferate and acquire new functions by duplication, while other genes gain new functional properties through alternative splicing.

it was observed previously that duplicated genes, unlike singletons, undergo relaxation in selective pressure. the duplicate rapidly diverges from the original sequence due to a higher rate of nucleotide substitutions within the coding regions relative to orthologs  <cit> . here we show that there is another contributor to the fast divergence of duplicated genes: a higher level of exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes relative to singletons. previous work dealing with the correlation between alternative splicing and gene duplications indicated that there is less alternative splicing in duplicated genes and that there is alternative splicing loss after duplication  <cit> . all together our observations imply that although in general there is a reduction in alternative splicing in gene families, the level of tes exonization is higher in duplicated genes.

in the analysis described here, we found that, following duplication, genes can acquire new alternatively spliced isoforms through exonization of transposed elements and that genes with more than one copy per genome  tend to undergo more exonization of te elements in one of the duplicates than do singletons. this indicates a high level of selection against exonization in singletons, with fewer restrictions against exonizations in multi-copy genes. it also supports the observation that one of the duplicates is under lower selective pressure, which allows the accumulation of mutations leading to exonization without deleterious effects on the organism.

our results suggest that alternatively spliced exons that originate from exonization of transposed elements are found significantly more frequently in duplicated genes than in singletons. we selected one of these duplicated genes, tif-ia, for further examination. tif-ia underwent a humanoid-specific triplication, in which one of the duplicates retained the evolutionary conserved exon-intron structure and maintained the reading frame. because the two duplicates were under less evolutionary constraint, each underwent substantial changes with respect to the original copy. these changes include large and small deletions and point mutations in the original coding sequence. in addition, in one of the duplicates, we identified an exonization of an alu element that was inserted into the first intron prior to the duplication. all three copies of tif-ia gene are active transcriptionally, but the wild-type gene is the major contributor to tif-ia mrna levels. only the wild-type mrna is translated into protein. we found negligible levels of this exonization in diverse normal tissues and diverse cell lines, with the exception of the 293t and bj- <dig> cell lines . in contrast, when we examined various leukemia cell lines, we discovered high levels of l2-alu-exonization in  <dig> of the  <dig> cell lines. this indicates that the definition of this alu as an exon is restricted to certain types of cancers. the genomic sequence of the alu between the cells that show exonization and those that do not is unchanged . this implies that this exonization is due to aberrant expression or activity of one or more splicing factors.

next, we generated a mini-gene with the genomic region of locus  <dig>  the original copy of tif-ia gene. the single product of this wild-type mini-gene was the one that joined exon  <dig> with exon 2; the alu element was intronic. introducing a single point mutation at position - <dig> of the 3'ss  in the alu element strengthened the 3'ss  <cit> . the main spliced isoform in this mutant was the one in which 5'ss-b was selected. alternative splicing of alu exons usually generates both the isoform containing the additional exon and the original isoform that presumably holds an important function in the cell. thus, alternative exonization with low inclusion level can advance transcriptomic diversification. we previously demonstrated that alternatively spliced alu exons have low inclusion levels   <cit> . this strongly suggests that a point mutation that strengthened the alu element 3'ss were to occur in the original gene of tif-ia , there would be a substantial decrease in the amount of the evolutionary conserved protein. under these conditions, a genetic disease might develop  <cit> .

tif-ia  is a vital gene  <cit> , however its two duplicates  are probably non-functional based on their relative short open reading frames and very low expression levels. this duplication probably represents the non-functional stage described by ohno in the period of time following the duplication event. as described by ohno, this initial phase of non-functionalization will be followed by complete relaxation of selective constraints and may be followed by a neo-functionalization process, wherein the duplicate acquires a new function  <cit> . the ncf <dig> gene duplicates may also be in the non-functional stage as its two well-described pseudogenes are presumably non-functional  <cit> .

why might there be selective forces against acquisition of the exons in certain genes and others not? we have demonstrated recently that conserved human-mouse alternative exons that disrupt the reading frame  tend to undergo fixation in the beginning of the gene, whereas those in the middle and the 3' half of the genes were presumably "weeded out" during evolution  <cit> . this suggests that acquisition of new exons close to the beginning of the genes is tolerated. in contrast, those in other parts of the genes are deleterious because polypeptides translated from these mrnas are less likely to be targeted for the nonsense mediated decay than shorter products and the exon-containing isoforms are likely to be deleterious to the cells. if the initial exonization is natural or even present beneficial advantages to the cells, it will lead to an increase in the inclusion level of these alternative exons  <cit> . the mutation in the 3'ss of the l2-aex in tif-ia gene  presumably occurred during evolution in some individuals, but was selected against since tif-ia is a vital gene, this isoform must have been deleterious due to the insertion of a premature termination codon.

CONCLUSIONS
our results add another layer to our understanding of the delicate interplay between gene duplication and alternative splicing. both increase gene complexity, albeit through different mechanisms. we have demonstrated an indirect link between duplication of genes and exonization of transposed elements. duplicated genes, especially the non-functional, tend to undergo exonization more than singletons.
