BACKGROUND
citrus trees produce non-climacteric hesperidium fruits with outstanding agricultural and economic relevance. at the morphological level, citrus fruits consist of an inner edible flesh , an intermediate spongy layer  and an external coloured peel containing pigments and essential oils . fruit development in oranges has been divided into three consecutive phases, characterized by a high rate of cell division but slow fruit growth during approximately two months after anthesis , a second phase of rapid increase in fruit size due to cell enlargement and water accumulation , and finally a phase of very reduced rate of fruit growth and ripening   <cit> .

citrus fruit maturation shows specific features in flesh and flavedo tissues. whereas internal maturation in the flesh is accompanied by an increase in the content of solutes and a decrease in acidity, external maturation is typically characterized by a change in colour from green to orange caused by the concomitant catabolism of chlorophylls and the synthesis of carotenoids  <cit> . under specific environmental conditions, the changes in colour occurring in flavedo may be reversible and are affected by endogenous factors, such as nutrients  and phytohormones   <cit> . the biochemical pathways underlying these transformations of pigments have been partially elucidated. ethylene-induced chlorophyllase activity and gene expression has been negatively related to chlorophyll content suggesting the involvement of the enzyme in colour breakdown of flavedo  <cit> . the characteristic orange colouration of oranges and mandarins is due to the accumulating carotenoids in chromoplasts, particularly oxygenated derivatives  and several specific carotenoid cleavage products   <cit> . citrus genes coding for enzymes involved in the synthesis and modification of carotenoids have been previously isolated and their evolution during natural and ethylene-induced ripening described  <cit> .

despite such extensive analysis of the physiological and biochemical aspects of fruit external maturation, studies describing induced or natural mutants showing an altered pattern or timing of colour acquisition are scarce yet. among them, the orange  mutant pinalate produced yellow-coloured fruits due to an unusually high accumulation of linear carotenes instead of cyclic and oxygenated carotenoids. the mutant also exhibited reduced synthesis of aba. however, the specific alteration of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in pinalate is currently unknown  <cit> . the nan spontaneous mutation of 'washington navel' orange, as formerly characterized in our group, showed an abnormal brown colour in the ripe flavedo caused by a defective catabolism of chlorophylls. transcript profiling indicated that a sgr-like  gene was expressed at lower levels in nan flavedo, suggesting that nan mutation could be associated to a sgr-like upstream regulatory factor  <cit> . recently, the delay in fruit colouration displayed by the slow-ripening clementine mutant 'tardivo'  has been associated with altered expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes and different sensitivity to the exogenous application of ethylene  <cit> .

as part of a mutagenic approach to citrus functional genomics, our group established a collection of near  <dig>  independent citrus clementina mutants obtained by fast neutrons bombardment, which were expected to contain genomic deletions in hemizygous dosage. two of these mutants, called 39b <dig> and 39e <dig>  were molecularly characterized by array-comparative genomic hybridization for the identification of deleted genes. the structure of 39b <dig> deletion, determined at the bac resolution, contained more than  <dig> identified genes spanning a large genomic region  <cit> . phenotypic evaluation for several consecutive years demonstrated that 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants have a significant delay in external fruit colour break. in this work we complete the phenotypic characterization and provide the transcriptomic profiling of flavedo from these mutants.

RESULTS
delay of colour change in 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants
mutants 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> showing delayed fruit colour break for several consecutive years were obtained from a population of near  <dig>  citrus clementina plants mutagenized by fast neutrons irradiation. fruits from 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> retained an appreciable greenish colour at the end of november, while fruits from the non-mutagenized parental  had already initiated the shift to orange at this time . a previous structural analysis of the hemizygous genomic deletions found in these mutants reported large dna lesions containing a high number of genes, but no evidences of overlapping regions in the 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> deletions were observed  <cit> . in order to characterize the nature of colour break alterations affecting these mutants, changes in flavedo colour index  were measured throughout fruit development in both mutants. as shown in figure 1b, flavedo ci in clementine followed a sigmoid curve shifting from negative  to positive values , approximately at mid november. the pattern of colour change in 39b <dig> fruits showed a similar behaviour but with a delay of three-four weeks. in 39e <dig> mutants, however, ci increased at a slower rate  and reached lower final values than the clementine and 39b <dig> plants . these observations suggested that 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutations affect fruit external ripening in distinct ways; the 39b <dig> mutation causes a simple delay in flavedo colour change, while the 39e <dig> mutant is characterized by a reduced rate of colour acquisition leading to an unusual yellowish external appearance after full ripening.

chlorophyll and carotenoids accumulation in the mutants
in order to gain a deeper insight into the biochemical alterations affecting 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants, total chlorophylls and total and individual carotenoids were determined in flavedo from both mutants and parental fruits at two different developmental stages: in november when colour differences with clementine were more evident  and in january when all three genotypes had reached the final colouration.

total chlorophyll pigments were four to five-fold more abundant in 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> than in the parental , which suggests a slower chlorophyll catabolism or a general delay of maturation. these data were in close agreement with the greenish appearance of mutant fruits in november, while clementine fruits were already changing to orange . no chlorophylls were however detected two months later, when the three genotypes showed an intense orange  or yellowish  colouration. total carotenoids were in 39b <dig> lower than in clementine in november as expected from the delayed colour break in this mutant, and also in january. on the contrary, 39e <dig> mutant showed a higher amount of carotenoids in november, but no significant statistical differences were observed with respect to the parental in january.

the profile of individual carotenoids obtained in the flavedo of clementine essentially coincided with previous reports in this variety, characterized by a reduction in β,ε-carotenoids and neoxanthin and an increase of specific β,β-xanthophylls during ripening  <cit> . in january, the 39b <dig> mutant exhibited a carotenoid profile very similar to that of the clementine. however, the pattern of pigment distribution in 39b <dig> in november differed significantly from the parental, showing lower percentages of phytoene, phytofluene and β-citraurin, and higher amounts of β-carotene, neoxanthin, α-cryptoxanthin and lutein , characteristics of chloroplastic tissues, in good agreement with the delayed external colouration in 39b <dig> fruit. other β,β-xanthophylls more typical of chromoplastic citrus peel, as β-cryptoxanthin, anteraxanthin and 9-z-violaxanthin, were found in a percentage higher than expected, however the lower amount of total carotenoids in 39b <dig> indicated a roughly similar absolute accumulation of them in both 39b <dig> and clementine.

the carotenoid profile of 39e <dig> mutant showed common features in november and january. in both samples, the absence of the apocarotenoid β-citraurin  was associated with a higher accumulation of the xanthophylls β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin. this observation is of special significance because despite the relevant contribution of β-citraurin, a red-orange pigment, to the typical peel colour of oranges and mandarines  <cit> , the specific cleavage reaction producing this c30-apocarotenoid has not been yet elucidated. the total absence of β-citraurin in fully ripened flavedo of 39e <dig> mutant suggests that such cleavage reaction could be impaired in this genotype, leading to its distinctive pale yellowish peel. the concomitant increase of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin in 39e <dig> might indicate a substrate-product relationship between them and β-citraurin, reinforcing previous suggestions  <cit> . such alteration in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway corroborates at the biochemical level colour-based observations on the different developmental defects affecting 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants. however we cannot rule out the presence of multiple mutations in 39e <dig> leading to separate effects on colour break delay and carotenoid accumulation. under this assumption, the observed delay in external colouration could be caused by the same locus in both mutants.

differential expression profiling in flavedo
the availability of 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants has been exploited to identify major factors involved in regulation of fruit maturation through the transcriptomic analysis of flavedo tissue from these mutants. we took advantage of a citrus cdna microarray previously described  <cit>  to perform large scale hybridization experiments comparing mrna isolated from green flavedo of both mutants and clementine flavedo undergoing colour break collected the same day. after microarray hybridization and analysis, cdnas showing a signal intensity more than double or less than half of control, under a p-value threshold of 10- <dig>  were considered as differentially expressed genes. signal ratios and false discovery rates of selected genes have been included as supplementary material in additional file  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig> from the  <dig> and  <dig> cdnas overexpressed in 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants, respectively,  <dig> were common. similarly, a relatively high percentage of down-regulated cdnas were shared by 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> flavedos . the occurrence of common transcripts confirms the alteration of particular transcriptional programs in both mutants, which could be revealed by data mining of these coincident clones. none of the  <dig> cdnas that were found to be simultaneously down-regulated in both mutants were coincident with the known deleted genes of 39b <dig> and 39e <dig>  therefore, they are not expected to reduce their expression as a consequence of their occurrence in a genomic deletion. however, additional deletions to those reported in the published structural characterization of the 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> hemizygous deletions  <cit>  might occur in the genome of these mutants and consequently we cannot elucidate whether or not a certain down-regulated gene is included in a deleted fragment.

functional classification of cdnas differentially expressed in both 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants highlighted major biochemical features underlying peel colour progression . thus, "photosynthesis" was one of the pivotal enriched categories in the mutants due to the presence in flavedo of photosynthetically active green chloroplasts. several cdnas coding for proteins involved in light harvesting, photosynthetic electron transfer chain, calvin cycle and chlorophyll biosynthesis were overexpressed in mutant samples , while no "photosynthesis" category could be created in the list of underexpressed cdnas .

similarly, known biochemical and physiological features of citrus fruit flavedo at an advanced maturation stage, such as substitution and accumulation of secondary metabolites and cell wall degradation properly correlated with the enrichment and large size of the functional category "metabolism" and to a lesser extend with the category of "cell wall modification" . for example, a valencene synthase responsible for the accumulation of valencene, an important sesquiterpene in the aroma of ripened citrus fruits  <cit> , is catalogued as a down-regulated gene . conversely, a γ-terpinene synthase, involved in the biosynthesis of the monoterpene γ-terpinene in immature green fruits  <cit> , is in the list of up-regulated genes .

interestingly, the transcriptomic study revealed that colour change appears to be also highly dependent upon a major transport activity. the most striking and novel observation in this regard was the high number of putative transporters of mineral elements and metals included in the functional category of "transport" that were down-regulated in the green flavedo of both mutants . thus, several sulfate and nitrate transporters, including a membrane transporter nrt <dig>  implicated in chloride homeostasis  <cit> , generic metal membrane transporters and specific zinc transporters were common in this category, suggesting that the mobilization of mineral elements such as sulfur, nitrogen, chloride, zinc and other metals may play a relevant role in flavedo ripening. the presence of a gene coding for a ferritin-like protein in the listing of down-regulated cdnas  may exemplify the relevance of these transporters in the colour-break flavedo. plant ferritins have been described as chloroplastic and mitochondrial proteins involved in fe oxidation and fe storage, protecting the cells from the oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species produced by free iron  <cit> . for instance, limited iron availability in chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been postulated to induce ferritin coding genes in order to buffer iron released by the degradation of photosystem i , an important sink for this metal  <cit> . similarly, a related ferritin-like gene, up-regulated during leaf senescence in brassica napus, has been proposed to be involved in mobilization of iron from senescing cells to developing organs, where the metal is highly required  <cit> . thus, ferritin accumulation in clementine flavedo tissue undergoing colour break may apparently contribute to the sequestering and recycling of iron molecules released during the degradation of photosystems and light-harvesting complexes, at the transition from chloroplast to chromoplast. the membrane transporters listed in table  <dig> could initiate subsequent mobilization of the sequestered iron and maybe other metals and mineral elements to the cells requiring them.

the category of "transport" was also enriched with cdnas coding for other several kinds of transporters including abc transporters, sugar and protein transporters, aquaporin, h+-atpases and other unidentified membrane transporters associated with the green stage of the flavedo .

a myb-related transcription factor down-regulated in 39b <dig> and 39e7
whereas nine different cdnas coding for transcriptional regulators, including three ethylene response factors, were up-regulated in 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> , only one was down-regulated in both mutants . this transcription factor belongs to a subgroup of the garp  subfamily of myb-related proteins containing a coiled-coil domain, which has been recently designated gcc   <cit> . consequently, we named the protein deduced from this cdna ccgcc <dig> . this gene was not found in a previous genomic approach to identify deleted genes in 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants  <cit> , and hence no gene dosage effects are expected to contribute to lower its expression in the mutants.

the partial sequence of ccgcc <dig> cdna annotated in clone  was completed by sequencing its 3' end. the resulting nucleotide and amino acid sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  database similarity search by blastp analysis  <cit>  of the  <dig> residues long protein deduced from the cdna confirmed a high similarity to other members of the gcc subgroup. we used the smart  <cit>  and coils  <cit>  applications to localize the garp dna-binding and the coiled-coil domains respectively, which are highlighted in figure  <dig> 

in order to compare ccgcc <dig> and other related citrus ests with known members of this gcc subgroup, we selected a  <dig> amino acids long fragment fusing garp and coiled-coil domains of ccgcc <dig> and several homologous proteins and translated ests  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree of these proteins showed two major groups with ccgcc <dig> clustered with phr <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana, a protein involved in phosphate starvation signalling . the closest homolog to ccgcc <dig> among those polypeptides was , coded by at5g <dig> gene from arabidopsis. interestingly, a search into the atgenexpress database containing microarray expression data of arabidopsis genes revealed that at5g <dig> is mostly expressed in tissues lacking chloroplasts such as roots and to a lesser extent pollen and flower organs  <cit> .

ccgcc <dig> expression correlates with colour change processes
in order to investigate the time-dependent expression of ccgcc <dig> during fruit external maturation in clementine, flavedo tissues collected before , during  and after fruit colour break , were subject to rna extraction and quantitative rt-pcr with ccgcc <dig> specific primers. figure 5a shows that the expression level of ccgcc <dig> in clementine increased about 15-fold during flavedo ripening, while 39b <dig> mutant maintained low expression levels in november and only experienced a slight increase in january. a similar change on ccgcc <dig> expression was observed in 39e <dig> mutant when samples harvested in november were assayed . these results confirmed that ccgcc <dig> gene expression was induced during colour break of clementine fruits whereas mutants 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> affected in the rate of colour break were unable to properly express the gene.

to determine if the expression of ccgcc <dig> gene was also responsive to other factors modulating colour change, a further experiment using external applications of gibberellins was performed . gibberellins  operate as colour change retardants during fruit external maturation since ga application on green flavedo causes a significant delay in colour break  <cit> . forty-two days after the first application, fruits treated periodically with gibberellin a <dig> showed a delay of about  <dig> colour units with respect to untreated fruits . interestingly, the ga-dependent retard in peel colour was accompanied by a parallel delay in ccgcc <dig> induction . these results indicate that ccgcc <dig> also responds to the ga-dependent pathway regulating flavedo ripening and taken together with the previous observations suggest the participation of ccgcc <dig> in a regulatory pathway acting in parallel or subsequently to colour break processes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, the citrus mutants 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> showing a delay in fruit colour change have been phenotypically characterized and used to identify through the analyses of their transcriptomes about  <dig> genes that were directly related to peel ripening. the results indicated that the 39b <dig> genotype exhibits a simple delay in the rate of flavedo colouration, while 39e <dig> shows an additional altered pattern of carotenoid accumulation. we postulate that the yellowish colour of fully ripe 39e <dig> flavedo was due to a defective synthesis or accumulation of β-citraurin. analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed that colour change during peel ripening was strongly associated with a major mobilization of mineral elements and other previously known metabolic and photosynthetic changes. transcriptomic data also showed that expression of ccgcc <dig> gene coding for a transcription factor containing garp and coiled-coil domains, was strongly down-regulated in flavedo tissue of both mutants. application of gibberellin to green fruits postponed colour break and abolish the induction of ccgcc <dig> expression. taken together the results indicated that ccgcc <dig> down-regulation correlated with a delay in colour break induced by genetic, developmental and hormonal cues.
