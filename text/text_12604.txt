BACKGROUND
the plant surface is a complex molecular battlefield during plant-pathogen or plant-pest interaction. during infection, plant cells produce a group of proteins, coded by non-homologous genes, named pathogenesis related  proteins. seventeen pr-proteins families have been identified based on biological activity, which can range from cell-wall/membrane degrading enzymes, to protease inhibitors, and proteins related to oxidative metabolism  <cit> . each pr-protein family has a specific role during plant-pathogen interaction. some of them act as "attack" molecules to damage the pathogen, while others act as "defence" molecules, to protect plant cells from the molecular attack of pathogens. villamil and hoorn  <cit>  review aspects of this "zig-zag" model of plant-pathogen interaction.

xylanase inhibitor proteins  are potential "defence" molecules, which could act to prevent plant cell wall degradation by fungal hydrolytic enzymes. they have sequence similarity to glycoside hydrolases of family  <dig>  that are plant class iii chitinases . the gh <dig> family includes naturally inactive chitinases showing  <dig> topology that are predicted to show no catalytic activity due to mutations in the catalytic domain. some of these proteins have been identified as inhibitors of xylanases . in wheat, a chitinase-like xylanase inhibitor protein  had its structure elucidated and its mechanism of inhibition proposed  <cit> . structural features of these  <dig> chitinase-like xylanase inhibitors, as well its interaction with xylanases, has been reviewed recently  <cit> .

asian rust  is a new devastating disease, which has affected the cultivation of soybean  merril l) in brazil. it was first detected in the country by  <dig> and, due to favourable climatic conditions for fungal transmission, the productivity of the soybean crop, in yield/ha, declined by 17% from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . since the appearance of soybean rust in brazil, chemical fungicides from the group of triazoles, strobilurins and benzimidazoles have been used for the control of this disease. however, the use of these fungicides is related to neurological, immunological and reproductive disorders in mammals, as well as causing arrest of mitosis  <cit> . alternative, less environmentally-damaging methods for control of this pathogen that do not pose risks to human health are urgently required.

in this paper we report cloning, heterologous expression and enzymatic features of a new chitinase-like xylanase inhibitor protein  from coffee  , originally identified in the coffee genome  <cit>  as a class iii chitinase. caclxip showed only residual chitinolytic activity, but was an effective inhibitor of acrophialophora nainiana xylanases, which are important enzymes to phytopathogenic fungi virulence. when assayed towards p. pachyrhizi , caclxip was able to arrest spore germination. as far as we know, this is the first time that a xip-like molecule has been related to such biological activity. this work suggests that caclxip may be an eligible candidate for biotechnological approaches to control asian rust. such work is also trying to shed new light on the functional versatility of gh <dig> members and, consequently, the implication of such plurifunctionality for genome annotations and prediction of gene function.

RESULTS
cloning, heterologous expression and purification of caclxip
analysis of sequences present in the coffee genome data bank identified a type iii chitinase-like gene, present in contig  <dig>  which codes to a xylanase inhibitor protein. a cdna corresponding to this gene, designated caclxip, was cloned by rt-pcr techniques from rna prepared from coffee leaves. the amino acid sequence predicted from the fragment cloned encodes a  <dig> kda protein  which differs from the predicted sequence present in contig  <dig> by four amino acid substitutions  and an insertion of thr-ile downstream of ser <dig>  this difference can be explained by natural genetic variation between coffee plant used in the preparation of cdna library of coffee genome, and the one used in cloning procedures. however, according to modelling prediction, such substitutions do not disturb the  <dig> topology of gh <dig> members. the sequence coding for the mature protein, without plant signal peptide, was subcloned into a yeast expression vector  arranged in frame with an n-terminal secretory signal , and a c-terminal extension including a  <dig> tag. recombinant protein was produced by heterologous expression in pichia pastoris. after yeast transformation, a small scale expression assay was performed. one colony expressing a  <dig> kda protein was selected for growth in a fermenter. after fermentation and recovery of culture supernatant, the heterologous protein was more efficiently purified from the  <dig> litres of culture supernatant by ion-exchange chromatography instead of metal chelate affinity chromatography. approximately  <dig> mg of the recombinant caclxip protein was recovered, representating an expression level of  <dig> mg/l, a value more than four-fold higher than the one reported by fitches and colleagues for production of an insect chitinase in p. pastoris  <cit> . figure 1a shows analysis of the fractions from caclxip purification by sds-page gel electrophoresis.

comparison of caclxip with others gh <dig> and gh18-like proteins
plant class iii chitinases belong to family  <dig> of pathogenesis related proteins   <cit> . this class of glycoside hydrolase proteins is characterised by a  <dig> topology and an active site containing two aspartic acid residues  and one glutamic acid residue   generally separated by phenylalanine and isoleucine  . hevamine is a model plant class iii chitinase, for which a full structure had been obtained by x-ray crystallography  <cit>  and a catalytic mechanism established  <cit> . in the coffee genome data bank there are at least  <dig> contigs containing complete sequences predicted to encode class iii chitinase proteins  showing  <dig> up to 57% of sequence identity with hevamine, including the catalytic domain . the protein predicted by contig  <dig> contains a catalytic site sequence "dfhiq", where a glutamine residue replaces the catalytic glutamic acid . such a substitution was demonstrated to be related to a lack of chitinolytic activity  <cit> . these data suggest that the sequence found in contig  <dig> belongs to a group of naturally inactive plant class iii chitinases, exemplified by concanavalin b  <cit> , that are thought to have recently evolved from pr- <dig> family. members of this group of proteins have been shown to retain a function in plant cell defence through action as xylanase inhibitors.

evaluation of enzymatic role of caclxip in plant defence
three samples representing stages of expression and purification of caclxip were assayed for chitinolytic activity . the p. pastoris culture supernatant contains chitinase activity, but this is not significantly increased in recombinant yeast expressing caclxip. purified caclxip contains no significant chitinolytic activity at ph  <dig>  . repetition of the assays in a ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  neither showed any enzymatic activity. a 10-fold increase in caclxip concentration in combination with a doubling of the incubation time still did not show any enzymatic activity. the same lack of chitinase activity was observed by mclaughlan and colleagues in xip-i from wheat  <cit> . the absence of significant chitinolytic activity in caclxip suggested that it might act as a proteinaceous inhibitor of xylanase, and this was confirmed when caclxip was used in an inhibition assay against complex xylanase fractions from aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger and acrophialophora nainiana. no inhibition activity was observed towards a. flavus xylanases, however caclxip inhibited xylanases from a. nainiana and a. niger by 56% and  <dig> %, respectively, when assayed in an enzymes:inhibitor ratio of 12: <dig>  .

different groups have reported that wheat xip-i has no activity towards bacterial xylanases  <cit> . the activity of caclxip towards these enzymes is unknown, but the caclxip gene is highly transcribed in coffee leaves infected by the bacterial pathogen xylella fastidiosa . the details of the mechanism of action of fungi and bacterial xylanases which could lead to such inhibition specificity were reviewed by sunna and antranikian  <cit> . wheat xip-i transcription can be induced by pathogens as well as by abiotic stress, such as wounding and methyl jasmonate treatment  <cit> , although xip-like genes are also expressed in tissues during growth and development of healthy wheat plants  <cit> , as well as in response to pathogens  <cit> . in rice, three different xips were also induced by phytohormones and wounding in different tissues  <cit> . these results demonstrate that the role of plant xylanase inhibitor proteins in plant metabolism as a whole remain largely obscure.

arrest of phakopsora pachyrhizi spore germination by caclxip
when assayed at  <dig>  μg/μl, caclxip was able to inhibit the germination of spores of p. pachyrhizi by 45% . although there are no other studies showing fungi spore germination arrestment by a xip-like protein, the concentration at which caclxip has shown activity, besides high, can be considered significant when compared with the concentration at which 50% of f. moniliforme spores are affected  by a known antimicrobial peptide, like tobacco osmotin   <cit> . interestingly, inhibition of xylan degradation could not be the crucial factor for the arrestment to spore germination due to the absence of xylan in the assay reaction. in common with other phytopathogenic fungi, p. pachyrhizi uses a diversity of glycosidase enzymes to grow and infect plant cells  <cit>  including cellulases, xylanases and mannanases. as far as we know, this is the first time that a xip is reported to affect fungi metabolism other than through the disruption of xylan degradation.

CONCLUSIONS
the action of caclxip on germination of p. pachyrhizi spores represents a first approach towards a biotechnological solution to pathogen losses in soybean cultivation. expression of this protein in transgenic soybean could substantially increase resistance, with low environmental impact. however, caclxip may only be one of a range of defensive proteins of this type that could be exploited. the protein superfamily that includes glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> contains proteins of similar topology but varying functional roles. these proteins can act at different stages of the "zig-zag" model of attack and counterattack between plant and pathogen  <cit> , and a combination of different proteins could act synergistically in defence against pathogen attack. besides being expressed in combination with other defensive proteins, caclxip activity could be increased by techniques of in vitro molecular evolution  <cit>  and used to develop a gm soybean resistant to asian rust.
