BACKGROUND
uncovering the details of the machinery involved in gene regulation remains an open problem in both experimental and computational biology. part of this machinery is the collection of factors, along with the cognate transcription regulatory elements  that they bind to, that are responsible for the transcription of a given gene. this includes transcription factors and their sites, as well as histone modifications and other dna-associated proteins. how these factors interact is to a large extent unknown. a fundamental problem in gene regulation bioinformatics is the limited information in the dna binding typically displayed by transcription factors, which leads to many false positives when predicting binding sites in genomic sequences . since in vitro binding affinities can be accurately modeled using weight matrix models, the question is what additional information the cell uses to recruit the correct factor to its cognate sites. combinations of sites will be more information-rich and indeed, there are combinations of sites  that are responsible for tissue-specific gene expression, and which can also be used for prediction of regulatory regions  <cit> .

until recently, it was only possible to study the organization of binding sites for regulatory elements via computational methods, since experimental determination of single sites was time-consuming. examples include  <cit> , where cis-regulatory modules were detected by searching the promoters of co-expressed genes, and  <cit> , where the authors constructed a genetic algorithm to learn the structure of the modules. these studies clearly showed that within modules, there are often preferred distances between binding sites  <cit> . however, while these methods have been successful, they cannot replace experimental methodology. maturation of experimental techniques has made it possible to measure the binding of dna-binding proteins over whole or partial genomes by e.g. chromatin immuno-precipitation  followed by sequencing, often called chip-seq  <cit> , or chip followed by hybridization to dna probes covering the genome, often called chip-chip  <cit> . these techniques open new avenues for analyzing gene regulation, and in particular interaction between regulators. several of these kinds of data sets have been published. 

despite the technical and experimental developments, we still lack a suitable multivariate model for the joint occurrences of multiple transcription factor binding sites and other tres. computational approaches generally only treat co-occurrence of sites in a pairwise manner. pairwise analyses of the tres, like the inter-motif distance analysis in  <cit> , show that most tres co-occur, but this tells us little about whether the co-occurrence is due to a direct relation between the two tres or an indirect relation e.g. via other tres. an observed pairwise co-occurrence might for instance be solely explained by the recruitment of the corresponding regulators by a third factor. for this reason, it is important to develop multivariate models to be able to detect whether observed relations are mediated through other tres included in the model. 

to describe the phenomenon that tres do not occur completely independently of each other, we will throughout this paper use the terms interaction, relation and dependence. interaction is used to describe situations in which the combined occurrence of two tres is important for a single regulatory purpose. although the term has a physical connotation, we use it in a way that includes, but is not restricted to, physical interaction of the corresponding transcription regulators. relation is a more vague term, which covers the general phenomenom of two tre occurrences being somehow associated. dependence is a statistical concept, and a relation between two tres shows up as a dependence in their joint distribution of their occurrences. in the statistical models we will consider, we can make statements about dependence or independence - and in our case about a particular concept called local independence,  <cit> . the interpretation of the latter concept is that if two tres are locally independent then there is no direct relation between the tres. as the data considered in this paper are observational, we will not, however, be able to definitively deduce that any local dependence found in the data by our method represents a direct relation. to draw such conclusions, one would need stronger experimental evidence, for instance via an experiment activating and inactivating a particular tre. for one of the data sets we analyze, there are experimental results supporting that some of our findings represent real interactions.

we analyze two data sets; for comparison, we review previous studies based on these data. the first data set is from chen et al.  <cit>  in which the locations of  <dig> sequence-specific tfs and  <dig> transcription regulators in mouse embryonic stem cells were mapped using the chip-seq method. the analyses for co-occurrences are based on what chen et al. called multiple transcription factor-binding loci . these mtl were located by first finding peaks in the tags from the chip-seq experiment and then iteratively clustering peaks that were close to one another. they found two groups of tfs that tended to co-occur. the first group consisted of nanog, sox <dig>  oct <dig>  smad <dig> and stat <dig> and the second group consisted of n-myc, c-myc, e2f <dig> and zfx. some of the interactions between the tfs that were identified computationally were verified experimentally. specifically, interactions between oct <dig> and smad <dig> and between oct <dig> and stat <dig> were verified. this was done by a depletion of oct <dig>  which led to a reduction in smad <dig> and stat <dig> binding at sites usually bound by oct <dig> and smad <dig> or oct <dig> and stat <dig>  respectively. in addition, the association of p <dig> with nanog-oct4-sox <dig> clusters was validated for  <dig> sites by using chip-qpcr. depletion of oct <dig>  sox <dig> or nanog also reduced the binding of p <dig> 

the second data set is from the encode project  <cit> . this project aims to catalogue all functional regions of the human genome and is particularly important for the study of regulatory elements. in the pilot phase of the project, focusing on 1% of the genome, a large set of regulators were studied  <cit> . several papers focusing on different types of analyses of data from this rich source have been published to date. the study by zhang et al.  <cit>  is worthy of mention, since it shares part of our scope: it is an exploratory study of the distribution of  <dig> different tres assayed by different laboratories and under different experimental conditions, giving a total of  <dig> different chip-chip experiments. the main part of the analysis is based on  <dig> or  <dig> kb partitions, called 'genomic bins', of the regions analyzed. the distribution of chip-chip binding sites is quantified by counting the number of nucleotides, mij, that each binding site, i, covers in each bin, j. the count matrix, m, for each chip-chip experiment is treated as the observation from the experiment and is then used in the correlation analyses. the purpose of this pre-processing step is to convert the positional data on tre binding into matrix form, making the data amenable to standard multivariate analysis methods. principal component analysis  and clustering analysis are then used to study the co-occurrence of tres based on the genomic bins. the clustering provides a hierarchical grouping of the elements so that elements in the same group have a similar binding pattern as measured by the genomic bins. likewise, pca provides a picture, for instance via the bi-plot, of groupings in the data. the dominant correlation in the complete data set was ascribed to the effect of laboratory resulting in an affymetrix and a non-affymetrix subdivision of the data. for our analyses, we focus on the affymetrix subset of the chip-chip data from the encode pilot project. interactions among the tres in this set are to a large extent unknown.

while correlation analyses based on mtls or genomic bins might provide insights into occurrences of sites, we have some concerns with these approaches. most importantly, the choice of the clustering distance in the case of mtls and the genomic bin size limit the analyses to dependencies that are compatible with the chosen scale. in particular, all specific details of dependencies within the locus or genomic bin are lost. in addition, the binning is initiated at an arbitrary starting point and the choice of starting point could affect the results obtained; in other words, the placement of the bins might affect the final result. consequently, the correlation analyses may not provide a complete picture of how correlated tres affect one another's occurrences. moreover, the analyses in  <cit>  focused on correlation, which in reality is a matter of analyzing pairwise co-occurrences. steps were not taken to unravel the intricate details of the multivariate distribution of tre occurrences. intuitively, statistical models chosen to understand biological processes should be fitted to the biological data at hand, rather than the reverse. we suggest that the multivariate hawkes point process model is a more suitable framework for analyzing tre data, since no clustering of sites or binning is necessary.

our main result is to show that multivariate point process models - and in particular the hawkes process - are suitable for analyzing tre occurrences. moreover, we provide detailed results of separate analyses of the distribution of eleven tres from chen et al  <cit>  and eight tres from the affymetrix chip-chip experiment on the pilot encode regions. we identify the tres that do not show direct relations with other tres, and present quantitative results as to how much the occurrence of one tre affects the probability of the occurrence of other tres, as a function of the distance between them. notably, in our analysis of the data from mouse embryonic stem cells, our method yields quantitative conclusions similar to those in  <cit> ; we find the experimentally verified interactions and detect the same grouping of the tfs as the original study. additionally, our model provides more detailed quantitative information and we detect an interaction between two tfs that was missed by the analysis in  <cit>  but was experimentally verified in other studies  <cit> .

RESULTS
the objective is to investigate whether the occurrence of one tre directly affects the occurrences of other tres. the correct scale for studying the organization of tres on the genome seems to be a scale where most regulators show point-like interactions with the genome at binding sites that each cover only a few nucleotides, since this corresponds to actual binding site sizes. at this stage, it is helpful to review the chip-seq and chip-chip techniques. chip-seq/chip are based on a protocol that first fixes dna-bound proteins to dna by cross-linking, followed by shearing of the dna. antibodies are then added to isolate the dna bound by a protein of interest . the sheared dna sequences are approximately 400- <dig> bp long, depending on the protocol used. for chip-seq, the 5' or 3' edges of the fragments are sequenced. these sequence reads can then be mapped back to the genome, and the site of the cognate dna-binding protein can be determined using specific algorithms, see e.g.  <cit> . adjacent regions on the dna with a high frequency of mapped sheared sequences from the chip step are merged into a larger block. this implies that it is possible to merge two or more binding sites in a single block, since individual signals end up being merged if they are physically close together. for chip-chip, the sheared dna sequences are hybridized to an array of dna probes that are designed to cover the genome with a certain spacing between the probes. as for chip-seq data, sets of probes that are consecutive on the genome and have high hybridization signals will be merged into a larger block corresponding to the dna region spanning the probes. since probes cannot be placed on repetitive genomic sequences and repetitive sequences may map to more than one location on the genome, a larger block can be broken up by occurrences of repeat elements in both chip-seq and chip-chip data. finally, since both methods are based on a chip step, the regions detected are much larger than the actual underlying tres, and hence we need to obtain proxies for the actual locations of the tres from the wider chip data.

multivariate analysis of tres for mouse embryonic stem cell data
for the application of our model to the chip-seq data from chen et al  <cit> , we focus on  <dig> tres:  <dig> tfs and  <dig> transcription regulators. we let

 i={nanog, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  stat <dig>  smad <dig>  zfx, c-myc, n-myc, e2f <dig>  p <dig>  suz12} 

denote the set of these tres. inspired by  <cit> , we investigate the use of the hawkes process, where the main specification consists of a collection of functions gm, k for each combination of m, k ∈ i of tres considered . given that we observe tre m, the intensity for observing tre k downstream at a distance s is then given as a baseline intensity multiplied by gm, k. the most important hypotheses to investigate are whether gm, k =  <dig>  which means that the occurrence of tre k is not affected by upstream occurrences of tre m. we can use standard methods for testing these hypotheses and as described in the methods section, we can use the results to determine local independencies in the data. 

in the multivariate analysis of the  <dig> tres we initially allow for all  <dig> potential interactions among the tres. as described in the methods section, each of the g-functions are modeled using a spline basis expansion of log gm, k for m, k ∈ i with  <dig> equidistant, fixed knots. we choose to place the knots so that we limit the range of dependence to a maximum of  <dig> base pairs downstream.

estimates of the  <dig> g-functions are shown in figure  <dig>  for each tre, these functions show the factor by which that tre affects the downstream baseline intensity of another tre , as a function of the distance between the tres. a point-wise 95% confidence interval is also shown for each of the estimated functions. adopting the terminology of  <cit>  we say that a value less than one means that a given inter-tre distance tends to be avoided, while a value greater than one means that a given inter-tre distance tends to be favored.

it is important to point out that the implementation of the hawkes process treats the genome simply as a line along which events  happen. this means that the descriptors "downstream" and "upstream" are dependent only on the direction we assign to the genome and not on the actual direction of genes. the estimated gm, k-functions in figure  <dig> were estimated in the forward direction of the genome; i.e., the lowest numbered nucleotide in each chromosome based on the assembly coordinates was used as the starting point. we will discuss this point in more depth below.

the overall impression from figure  <dig> is that generally, the occurrence of one tre affects the occurrence of another tre by increasing its intensity immediately downstream, with the effect then leveling off. for instance, there is a more than 10-fold increase in the intensity for occurrences of zfx, c-myc and n-myc immedialy downstream of e2f <dig>  however, several of the estimated effects do not seem to be significantly different from one.

the largest positive effects are found among the four tres in the upper left corner, e2f <dig>  zfx, c-myc and n-myc and among the three tres nanog, sox <dig> and oct <dig>  this indicates that the factors in the two groups often bind in proximity to each other. in addition, the three tres stat <dig>  p <dig> and smad <dig> seem to be more related to the group consisting of nanog, sox <dig> and oct <dig> than to the other group. this is consistent with the analyses by chen et al  <cit> . we also observe possible relations between suz <dig> and oct <dig> and zfx and n-myc, respectively. in the original study, no relation with suz <dig> was reported, but another study reported an interaction between suz <dig> and oct <dig> in mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> . the experimental validation was based on both pcr analysis of the promoters and a knockdown study where reduced levels of oct <dig> led to a loss of suz <dig> at certain target promoters.

based on the log gm, k-functions, we clustered the  <dig> tres  in order to link regulators that co-occur. the result of this clustering is presented in figure  <dig> and shows two clusters of tres. the first cluster consists of e2f <dig>  zfx, c-myc and n-myc, while the second includes nanog, sox <dig>  oct <dig>  suz <dig>  stat <dig>  p <dig> and smad <dig>  again, this is consistent with the results presented in  <cit> , apart from the suz <dig> findings. 

the functions on the diagonal  in figure  <dig> represent the self-dependencies of the tres, i.e., the effect of the occurrence of a tre on the downstream occurrence of that same tre. all  <dig> effects seem significantly different from one and all have a characteristic shape, with a clear depletion of the intensity for the first  <dig> nucleotides. for some of the tres, the effects approach  <dig> thereafter and for others, there is a small positive effect after  <dig> nucleotides. the self-dependence for the transcription regulator suz <dig> stands out, with a large  effect after  <dig> nucleotides. while there are many reports that show homotypic clusters of transcription factor binding sites  <cit> , the depletion and peaks might be technical artifacts. depletions can be attributed to the case where multiple binding sites are located very close to each other; in this case, the block will be interpreted as a single binding event, with the implication that sites located close together will never be detected. peaks might occur due to the presence of repeat elements that break up larger regions. in the suz <dig> case, the effect after  <dig> bp does not seem to be a technical artifact, since the effect is large.

in most cases, transcription factors have no strand preference relative to their regulated gene when it comes to binding, and regardless, strand information is lost in the chip experiment and the experiment will not explicitly tell us which gene is the regulatory target of a given site. consequently, we fit the model to a mixed signal. if two tres typically occur in a specific order when involved in the regulation of a gene, then the order is reversed from the forward direction point-of-view if the tres are involved in the regulation of a gene in the reverse direction. we argue that if there is an equal distribution of tres involved in regulation in the forward and reverse directions, the mixed signal should be approximately symmetric, which would then imply that the shapes of gm, k and gk, m do not differ that much up to a multiplicity factor. from figure  <dig>  we see that this is true in most cases  but we also see some deviations from this .

to further investigate the estimated effects for each combination of m, k ∈ i, we test the hypothesis

 h0:gm,k= <dig>  

this is the hypothesis of local independence of the m'th tre on the k'th tre, conditional on the upstream occurrences of the kth tre and the remaining  <dig> tres, as described in the methods section. if we reject h <dig>  the interpretation is that there is a direct relation between the occurrence of tre m and the downstream occurrence of tre k. of course, we can not rule out that such a relation can be explained by a factor not included in our analysis, but we can say that the other tres included can not collectively explain the relation. on the other hand, if we do not reject h <dig>  there is no evidence in the data for a direct relation between the occurrence of tre m and the downstream occurrence of tre k. the p-values for the  <dig> tests are shown in figure  <dig>  with tests for which h <dig> is rejected shown as red squares. as in figure  <dig>  we use the forward direction of the genome. we find that all tres show significant self-dependence, as discussed above. in addition, we observe that many of the interactions are significant, with oct <dig> having interactions with all the other tfs, and suz <dig> having the fewest interactions with other tfs. all interactions within the group consisting of e2f <dig>  zfx, c-myc and n-myc are significant, as is those within the group consisting of nanog, sox <dig>  oct <dig>  stat <dig>  p <dig> and smad <dig>  which again is in accordance with the analyses in  <cit> .

we found a significant effect of the occurrence of suz <dig> on downstream occurrences of oct <dig> but not the reverse. we argue that this asymmetry is a consequence of the inclusion of self-dependence terms in the model, combined with suz12's strong self-dependence, as can be seen in figure  <dig>  when we fit a model without the self-dependence term for suz <dig> , the asymmetry disappears. we believe that most of the observed self-dependencies, including the large self-dependence for suz <dig>  represent true self-dependencies; therefore we prefer to use the multivariate model including all self-dependence terms when analyzing the data.

multivariate analysis of tres for the pilot encode regions
to further investigate the applicability of our model we analyze a subset of the encode pilot data produced by affymetrix: the "affymetrix sites" track from the ucsc encode browser database resulting from a study of retinoic acid-treated hl- <dig> cells  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after treatment. initially, we focus on the 8-hour post-treatment results from the data and investigate the effects of the oriented specification of the model and the inclusion of histone modifications in the model. subsequently, we compare the results obtained at the four different time points. we focused on  <dig> tres, selecting classical transcription factors, the transcription machinery and chromatin boundary elements. because some regulatory elements, such as histone modifications, can not always be regarded as point-like, we include the two histone modifications, h3k27me <dig> and h4kac <dig>  as covariates in the modeling of the remaining eight tres. we let

 i={brg <dig>  cebpe, ctcf, p <dig>  pol <dig>  pu <dig>  rara sirt1} 

denote the set of these tres. aside from the inclusion of the histone modifications, an important feature, the model is the same as in the previous section. the intensity of the occurrence of a tre at a given location depends on upstream occurrences of other tres and on whether the histone modifications are present at the same location.

the set of tres available from the encode data is quite diverse and potential interactions among them are to a large extent previously undescribed. in the multivariate analysis of the  <dig> tres, we initially allow for all  <dig> potential dependencies among the tres. again, as described in the methods section, each of the g-functions are modeled using a spline basis expansion with  <dig> equidistant, fixed knots and a maximum range of dependence of  <dig> base pairs downstream. .

estimates of the  <dig> g-functions are shown in figure  <dig>  with the effect of each tre  on the downstream baseline intensity of another tre  as a function of the distance between the tres. as with the previous data set, we observe that several tres show a clear impact on the downstream occurrence of other tres and, as in the previous analysis, most estimated effects seem greater than one, suggesting that in general, the occurrence of a given tre affects the occurrence of another tre by increasing its intensity. all  <dig> self-dependencies are significantly different from one, and for all except cebpe, the g-function have a shape with a depletion of the intensity for the first  <dig> nucleotides, followed by a peak, with, for instance, a four-fold increase of the intensity for pol <dig> at approximately  <dig> nucleotides downstream. cebpe shows a different behavior with only the depletion of the intensity downstream of the occurrence of cebpe. as noted previously, both depletions and peaks might be technical artifacts. for chip-chip data, the peaks can be caused by genomic repeats, which can break up a longer signal block, causing the block to be interpreted as two binding events. on the other hand, the fact that cebpe does not show the same behavior indicates that the effect may actually not be a technical artifact. depletions might be attributed to multiple binding events occurring very close to one another, such that the block is interpreted as a single binding event, and since we use the center of the block as our proxy for the binding site, a depletion will occur if the block is large.

investigation of the oriented specification of the model
to investigate whether the estimated effects are statistically significant, for each combination of m, k ∈ i we test the hypothesis h0: gm, k =  <dig>  the p-values are shown in figure  <dig>  with tests for which the hypothesis is rejected shown as red squares. as in figure  <dig>  we use the forward direction of the genome. we find that all tres show significant self-dependence, as discussed above. we observe that rara appear to be directly associated with most of the other tres, both up- and downstream, whereas pu <dig> and pol <dig> show fewer significant direct relations with other tres.

keeping in mind that we fit the model to a mixed signal, we would expect to reject the hypothesis gm, k =  <dig> if, and only if, we reject the hypothesis gk, m =  <dig>  deviances from this, as seen in figure  <dig>  could be explained by an unequal distribution of these tres involved in regulations in the forward and reverse directions, respectively, in this data set.

regardless of a mixed signal, if we fit the model using the reverse direction of the genome, we would expect the estimate of gk, m to be similar to the estimate of gm, k in the forward direction. the g-functions estimated in the reverse direction are shown in figure  <dig>  to make the comparison with figure  <dig> easier, for each tre , the figure shows the factor by which that tre affects the downstream baseline intensity of another tre ; with this figure orientation the estimate of gk, m in the reverse direction is in the same place in figure  <dig> as the estimate of gm, k in the forward direction in figure  <dig>  we see that the estimated functions are indeed very similar for almost all of the tres, with most differences being differences in function amplitude only and not in shape. the different amplitudes can be due to tres occurring at different rates, such that at least one of the tres will occur in situations without the other tre.

we would also hope that the conclusions reached would be qualitatively symmetric - that is to say, that we reject h <dig> in the forward direction if, and only if, we reject h <dig> in the reverse direction. when we repeat the tests fitting the model in the reverse direction, we find that this is generally, but not entirely, the case. the p-values are shown in figure  <dig> with tests for which h <dig> is rejected shown as red circles. as in figure  <dig>  we have transposed the results relative to the forward direction, that is, the figure shows the effect of the tre  on the tre , to make the comparison simple. qualitatively, most of the conclusions are preserved, but  <dig> of the  <dig> tests had a different outcome when we estimate the model in the reverse direction. most notably, brg <dig>  pol <dig> and sirt <dig> are each involved in  <dig> of these tests. however, the conclusions for cebpe are identical and for ctcf, there is only one difference.

an explanation for seeing a direct relation of tre m on downstream occurrences of tre k in the forward direction, but not a direct relation of tre k on downstream occurrences of tre m in the reverse direction, could be that tre m occurs almost exclusively in relation to tre k, but tre k also occurs in many other situations in the absence of tre m. this could explain the results for the relations between brg <dig> and pol <dig> and between sirt <dig> and brg <dig>  since in these cases we see a direct relation of tre m  on the downstream occurrences of tre k  in the forward as well as in the reverse direction.

in conclusion, certain findings are consistent when estimating in either direction. the self-dependencies are all significant, and rara seems to have direct relations to all or most of the other tres both up- and downstream. rara is known to function as an active repressor by recruiting corepressors and/or deacetylases when its ligand is not present, and an activator when the ligand is present  <cit> . our observation that rara is directly related to most of the other tres is then an indication of the importance of the factor in this system, since the cells were treated with its ligand .

effect of histone modifications on occurrences of tres in the pilot encode regions
as mentioned above, the two histone modifications are included as covariates in our model. the effects of the histone modifications on the intensity for the occurrence of tre k in a modified region is captured by the fold change parameters γh3k27me3k and γh4kac4k, respectively .

the effect of h3k27me <dig> on the occurrence of pu <dig> and pol <dig> is, on the other hand, negligible, which might have to do with its effect as a repressor  <cit> . we observe that the presence of h4kac <dig> also show a pronounced effect on the occurrence of brg <dig> and cebpe, increasing the intensity by a factor of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the most pronounced effects of the presence of h3k27me <dig> are found for p <dig>  rara and ctcf where the intensity is increased by a factor of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

results for all four time points for the pilot encode regions
since data are available for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post-treatment, in addition to the  <dig> hours analyzed initially, we can investigate whether our findings are consistent over time. hence we fit our multivariate model to the data at these time points in the forward direction and test the hypotheses gm, k =  <dig> for all m, k ∈ i. the p-values are shown in figure  <dig>  we see that the results for  <dig> hours after treatment stand out compared to the other three time points, with many fewer significant relations. brg <dig> especially shows almost no relations with the other tres, with the effect of cebpe on downstream occurrences of brg <dig> the only exception. in particular, we note that the self-dependence has disappeared. in contrast, brg <dig> shows many relations with other tres at the other three time points. the fact that brg <dig> is observed less frequently  <dig> hours post-treatment compared with the other time points, combined with inspection of the estimated g-functions and their 95% confidence intervals , suggest that the much larger variance in the estimated signal for brg <dig> relations  <dig> hours post-treatment are at least part of the explanation for the observed differences among the time points. apart from the observations  <dig> hours post-treatment, many of the relations are consistent over time. we observe, for instance, that the local independence of cebpe and ctcf is present at all four time points, as is the relation between cebpe and p <dig>  we should note, however, that although many relations are preserved over time, this does not necessarily mean that the binding sites for the tfs are the same over time, only that there is a relation between the binding sites for the tfs.

discussion
the analyses presented here for the pilot encode data are based on a single set of chip-chip data from the pilot encode project, which only covers 1% of the genome. the interactions between the factors in this set have not been verified experimentally to date. this means that the findings from our analysis should be interpreted with some caution, in particular when extrapolating them to the whole genome. as with all computational methods, experiments are needed to verify that specific interactions are significant; the role of computational analyses is to give good starting points for experimental studies. however, our analysis of the genome-wide chip-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells shows that our method is able to identify interactions that can be verified experimentally. moreover, the estimated g-functions provide interpretable, quantitative information on how the different tres interact. furthermore, this quantification can be used to cluster the tres; however, we do not wish to overemphasize the applicability of this procedure in its current form, as we found the results of the clustering to be sensitive to the input data and choice of method.

ultimately, the goal is to understand the causal relations among the many components involved in the regulation of gene expression. our analysis provide a step in that direction but, as always with statistical analyses of observational data, we can not prove that an observed direct relation is causal - and even if it is, the analysis can not show the direction of the causality. to draw such conclusions, we need either experimental data or stronger causal assumptions  <cit> .

a major contribution of our multivariate analysis consists of the collection of local independencies among the tres that we identify and which would not have been revealed using pairwise methods. our analysis enables us to say which tres that do not seem to interact in the regulation of genes, allowing subsequent experimental studies to be focused on other combinations of tres. to illustrate this point, we observe in figure  <dig> that oct <dig> has a significant relation to upstream occurrences of suz <dig>  but that suz <dig> and sox <dig> show no significant relations. oct <dig> and sox <dig> do, however, show significant relations. a pairwise analysis including only suz <dig> and sox <dig> results in a significant relation between the two , but in light of the results of our multivariate analysis, we interpret this as an indirect effect mediated through oct <dig>  

the hawkes process is not the only suitable model for these data. the main reason for focusing on the hawkes process is that it is a flexible class of models, and the specification of the model as given in the methods section allows us to compute the likelihood function directly, such that we can easily apply standard methods . it might be argued that a drawback of the model is that we can only include information about upstream events in the conditional specification of the hawkes process. however, the specification is a purely technical matter that does not by any means rule out the possibility of the hawkes process capturing relations in both the up- and downstream directions, as seen from the comparison of results from the analysis in the forward direction with those from the analysis in the reverse direction. if we were to use spatial point process models, it would be possible to specify models that have no directionality in their specification. however, we have showed that most of the conclusions we obtain from the analysis using the hawkes process are robust to the direction we use for estimation. a range of point process models, including the hawkes process are used to model financial trading data  <cit> . the literature on spatial point processes is also rich, see e.g.  <cit> , and although most of these models were developed for two or three dimensions, they are also perfectly applicable in a one-dimensional setup. even so, for the typical spatial point process models the statistical inference becomes more subtle than for the hawkes process.

it can be argued that the choice of knots, and hence the number and range of the spline basis functions used in the specification of the hawkes process, could affect the results obtained. we used a relatively small number of knots and a relatively narrow range, but although details might change had we used more sophisticated knot positioning strategies, we found that our results, the qualitative conclusions in particular, were robust to the actual choice of knots.

we illustrated the use of the hawkes process with analyses of chip-chip/seq data for tres but the model can be equally useful for other types of multivariate, positional genome data, whether these data are experimental or computational. examples of such data are transcription factor binding sites, small rnas, or even genetic polymorphisms in different individuals. compared with the use of alternative methods such as in  <cit>  and  <cit> , where clustering of sites or genomic binning are needed, no such pre-processing steps are necessary for the application of the hawkes process. the model can capture both short- and long-range dependencies. with genomic binning, potential dependencies over longer distances are ignored in  <cit> , and the fine details of short-range dependencies are lost by the methods used in both  <cit>  and  <cit> . finally, we note that our method is based on a generative model on the scale of binding sites, in contrast to the models considered in  <cit>  and  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a statistical method to analyze the multivariate distribution of tres along the dna sequence. we have shown that by using the point process approach, we can perform a detailed analysis of the multivariate distribution of tres, providing both insightful qualitative information about local independence among the tres and quantitative information on how the tres affect the occurrence of one another. furthermore, we have shown that our method is able to detect experimentally verified interactions, as well as interactions missed by other computational methods. we find that to understand the interactions among many tres, it is crucial to carry out the analyses in a multivariate framework that includes all available information and relevant covariates; such an analysis emphasizes direct relations rather than indirect relations among the tres investigated.
