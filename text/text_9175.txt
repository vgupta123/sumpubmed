BACKGROUND
polybrominated diphenyl ethers  are commonly used as flame retardants. although the use of commercial mixtures such as pentabromodiphenyl ether and octabromodiphenyl ether in products has been banned or limited by the european union, the u.s., and other countries, pbde residues in the environment and in animal tissues still pose a serious threat  <cit> . among pbde congeners,  <dig> ′, <dig> ′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether  is the most frequently detected one  <cit> , and previous studies have demonstrated it to be the most toxic  <cit> . exposure to bde <dig>  an endocrine-disrupting chemical, can cause multiple adverse effects, and current research has focused on the examination of its endocrine-disrupting activity and neurobehavioral toxicity  <cit> . the best-known mechanism of bde <dig> toxicity involves its ability to impair the homeostasis and function of thyroid hormone  in animals because of its structural similarity to ths such as triiodothyronine  and thyroxine . moreover, bde <dig> can lead to various types of developmental neurotoxicity, including long-lasting behavioral alterations, by interfering with signal transduction pathways and by damaging neuron cell viability  <cit> .

recently, deep sequencing  has become a fast-growing high-throughput technology. compared to microarrays, deep sequencing is independent of predefined probe sets, thereby permitting the detection of novel transcripts and alternative splicing  <cit> . however, thus far, while rna sequencing has been increasingly used in toxicological studies of rodents and humans, it has only been employed for toxicological studies of aquatic species in a few studies  <cit> . in our previous study, 500 μg/l of bde <dig> caused a significant reduction of larval locomotion specifically at the switch between light and dark periods; the effects seemed to be related to light stimulus  <cit> . the evidence for this was that a pbde mixture, de- <dig>  containing bde <dig> was found to cause biochemical changes in the larval eye as measured by optokinetic responses and phototaxis tests  <cit> . therefore, to validate our hypothesis and understand the novel toxic mechanism of bde <dig>  we employed deep sequencing to obtain and analyze whole-transcriptome information for zebrafish larvae after exposure to bde <dig> 

in this study, the illumina hiseq sequencing platform was utilized to investigate the influence of pbdes on the gene expression profiles of zebrafish larvae. we chose 6 day post-fertilization  zebrafish larvae to keep aligned with our previous work  <cit> , and zebrafish at this stage already have many well-developed organs, for example retina. first, this study discovered that in  <dig> dpf zebrafish, bde <dig> exposure led to major adverse effects, including disrupting the visual perception and bone development of larvae. furthermore, the reduction of zebrafish larval locomotion was probably caused by the disruption of retinol metabolism by light stimulus, and body curvature was probably caused by abnormal bone development induced by bde <dig> 

RESULTS
characterization of the transcriptome of zebrafish larvae
the original rna-seq data are available at the gene expression omnibus database . sequencing produced approximately 48 m total reads from a blank control sample, 56 m total reads from a sample of  <dig> % dmso vehicle, 42 m total reads from a sample of 5 μg/l bde <dig>  and 38 m total reads from sample of 500 μg/l bde <dig>  of the total number of reads in these four groups, the mapping/unique mapping rates were  <dig> %/ <dig> %,  <dig> %/ <dig> %,  <dig> %/ <dig> %, and  <dig> %/ <dig> %, respectively. although the sequencing depth in this study was lower than that in some previous experiments  <cit> , high unique mapping rates provided the basis for adequate analysis.  <dig> transcripts were detected in at least one of four groups. excluding  <dig> non-coding rna and  <dig> miscellaneous rna, here we used  <dig> mrna transcripts in further steps.

because tmm normalization was considered to be superior to reads per kilobase of the transcript per million mapped  normalization in illumina-based rna sequencing  <cit> , tmm was adopted as our normalization strategy. the most abundant transcripts in the four groups, including si, myhz <dig>  ef1a, loc <dig>  try, pvalb <dig>  myhz <dig>  krt <dig>  hsp90ab <dig>  and pvalb <dig>  varied slightly in content across all treatments. however, the 500 μg/l bde47-treated group had more distinct impacts on the abundance of transcripts than the other  <dig> groups .

differential expression of genes with bde <dig> treatments
the differentially expressed genes of zebrafish larvae treated with two bde <dig> concentrations are shown as a venn diagram . by comparing bde <dig> treatments with the dmso solvent control,  <dig> transcripts were affected after 500 μg/l exposure, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated, and  <dig> transcripts were affected after 5 μg/l exposure, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. these values clearly indicate that exposure to a high bde <dig> concentration resulted in a higher number of up-regulated genes. the intersections of the venn diagram further revealed that less than 4% of up-regulated genes in the 500 μg/l bde47-treated group were also up-regulated in the 5 μg/l bde47-treated group, and the expression trends of a total of  <dig> genes reversed with increasing bde <dig> concentration. these features suggested that exposure to different bde <dig> concentrations resulted in different types of biological effects in the zebrafish development process. the maximum fc of genes was  <dig>   when exposed to 5 μg/l bde <dig> and up to  <dig>   when exposed to 500 μg/l bde <dig>  complete lists of differently expressed genes treated with both bde <dig> concentrations are shown in additional files  <dig> and 3: tables s <dig> and s <dig> figure  <dig>

the most significant genes  of zebrafish larvae after exposure to 500 μg/l bde <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  excluding those genes that were totally inhibited in the exposure group and with a tmm value <  <dig> in the dmso group,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were present. of the four most dramatically up-regulated genes, three transcripts encoded heat shock cognate  proteins: their mean fc was up to  <dig> . unlike canonical heat-shock proteins, the hsc proteins constitutively expressed and functioned during normal cellular processes; however, their up-regulation still reflected immune stress such as inflammation, infection, and cancer  <cit> . in the range of 10 < fc <  <dig>  the notable transcripts were those encoding cathepsin and pim <dig> enzymes. the protein products of cathepsin-related transcripts were similar to those of human cathepsin v, a protease highly homologous to mouse cathepsin l  <cit> . the pim <dig> oncogene is involved in multiple human cancers, and enhanced pim <dig> expression would benefit vision formation of zebrafish  <cit> .table  <dig>

marginal effect of bde <dig> on alternative splicing events
one advantage of deep sequencing over microarrays is its ability to detect alternative splicing, which is a common event in higher vertebrates. therefore, the effect of bde <dig> on the alternative splicing of larval transcriptome was investigated. the results are shown in table  <dig>  many diseases in animals are due to abnormal alternative splicing. however, bde <dig> exhibited only a marginal effect on the alternative splicing events of zebrafish larvae despite seriously affecting its transcriptome. we noticed that a similar outcome was observed in the case of benzene exposure  <cit> . two genes of tropomyosin, tpm <dig> and tpm <dig>  were significantly changed their alternative splicing patterns in the 500 μg/l bde <dig> exposure group. tropomyosin, which has diverse isoforms, plays a critical role in regulating the function of actin filaments; in particular, tpm <dig> may have a unique and vital role in embryogenesis.table  <dig>

functional enrichment based on different dynamic expression patterns
all significant mrnas were further classified into eight dynamic expression patterns under different concentrations, and the mrna number and p-value of each pattern were calculated . three patterns were significant: pattern  <dig> , pattern  <dig> , and pattern  <dig> . the results reaffirmed that the exposure of zebrafish larvae to high bde <dig> concentration exerted a significant influence on their transcriptome, and most genes remained stable expression under low bde <dig> concentration.figure  <dig> 
functional enrichment analysis based on different gene expression patterns.  expression profiles in color indicate significant ones . green, up-regulated; red, down-regulated. profile number , gene number , and trend  in each profile were labelled. the significant terms were graphed using  go annotation , and  kegg pathway annotation . tawny block, pattern 4; teal block, pattern 3; red block, pattern  <dig> 



according to the expression patterns of zebrafish larvae, functional enrichment analysis was performed, and biological process ontologies were adopted in go analysis. because of the excessive numbers of terms obtained, the false discovery rate  was used to calibrate the p-value. the complete go analysis results  are shown in figure 3b. pattern  <dig> represented the biological functions and processes that were significantly induced by bde <dig> treatment. the affected go terms mainly involved stress responses and metabolic processes such as: response to stress ; small molecule metabolic process ; nerve development ; and steroid metabolic process . patterns  <dig> and  <dig> represented the biological functions and processes that were significantly inhibited by bde <dig> treatment. in pattern  <dig>  the go analysis results reflected bde <dig> damage to the development of nerve, vision, and skeletal system in zebrafish larvae, e.g., extracellular matrix organization ; visual perception ; collagen fibril organization ; and skeletal system development . the most enriched terms in pattern  <dig> included: protein heterotrimerization ; extracellular matrix organization ; complement activation, alternative pathway ; and blood coagulation extrinsic pathway .figure  <dig>

kegg pathway analysis  screened out fewer terms than go analysis, and reflected different information from that obtained by go analysis. the significant terms in pattern  <dig> included: retinol metabolism ; chemical carcinogenesis ; steroid hormone biosynthesis ; metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig> ; and sulfur metabolism . the affected pathway terms in patterns  <dig> and  <dig> included: protein digestion and absorption ; ecm-receptor interaction ; and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-chondroitin sulfate . patterns  <dig> and  <dig> had similar enrichment results. the gene regulatory network of bde <dig> was constructed on the basis of the information provided by the kegg pathway database and visualized .

validation of sequencing data
to validate the sequencing data of bde <dig> treatment, the fcs of relative mrna expression levels of several selected genes were determined by real-time quantitative pcr . because, in the sequencing data, most of the genes significantly changed their expressions under exposure to high bde <dig> concentration but showed no significant changes of their expressions under low concentration, only a rt-qpcr assay using 500 μg/l bde <dig> was performed. the genes are listed in table  <dig>  and they include ch25h, loc <dig>  rx <dig>  fetub, sesn <dig>  opn1sw <dig>  hsp <dig>  cyp2k <dig>  pth1a, and lepb. the selected genes had significant expression changes with enough dimensions and they participated in biological functions we were concerned with, including xenobiotic metabolism , immune response , endocrine regulation , eye development , and photosensitivity . after rt-qpcr amplification, they were confirmed to have expression patterns similar to those observed by deep sequencing. even though the fc values of pth1a and lepb were lower than their sequencing data, the expression changes were still dramatically significant.table  <dig>

transcriptomic effects of dmso vehicle
to study the possible effects of dmso on zebrafish larvae, we compared the transcriptomes of the dmso vehicle and blank control. four hundred and fifty-four transcripts were significantly expressed , of which  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated. significantly changed transcripts accounted for about  <dig> % of the total detected transcripts, and no abnormal phenotype was observed during larval development . the effects of dmso vehicle on transcriptome in our study were far weaker than those in a previous study of turner et al.  <cit> . the most up-regulated gene was crfb <dig> , which encoded the cytokine receptor and its human homolog displayed inhibitory properties on il- <dig> effects. the expressions of  <dig> genes were totally inhibited, such as cyp11a <dig>  gtf3ab, and msh <dig>  functional enrichment analysis revealed that dmso had a major effect on inducing the immune responses of larvae. detailed results are shown in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

morphological and histological abnormality caused by bde <dig> exposure
to confirm the relationship between locomotor changes and disrupted larvae vision, histological sections of larval retina were prepared to investigate the effects of bde <dig> on eye histology . in the sections exposed to 500 μg/l bde <dig>  a clear morphological alteration of photoreceptor cells was observed, and in the remaining sections, no significant change  was observed compared to the control. at  <dig> dpf, disorderly arranged rods and cones  were observed. a bipolar cell layer  was also distributed more sparsely than in the control, and the thickness of bcl increased noticeably. in general, this structural alteration of the retina closely resembled the effects caused by polychlorinated biphenyls  <cit> , indicating that some common mechanisms probably exist among polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons.figure  <dig>

another apparent effect of 500 μg/l bde <dig> exposure on zebrafish larvae was the body curvature phenotype. almost all larvae exhibited different degrees of curvature ; however, it was particularly evident in some individuals . a close examination revealed that the curvature was related to the failed inflation of the swim bladder, and we hypothesized that the curvature may result in the malformation of the swim bladder. the abnormality of the notochord and swim bladder could have implications for larval locomotion. besides, there was no significant difference in hatching rates in both of the bde  <dig> exposure groups .

discussion
according to the results of our study and previous ones, the locomotion of zebrafish was found to be less active after exposure to pbde. several plausible hypotheses were suggested, including disruption of the transport and absorption of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine  <cit> , inhibition of the axonal growth of primary and secondary motor neurons  <cit> , and deformation of the larvae  <cit> . microscopic examination confirmed the spinal curvature of larvae under exposure to 500 μg/l bde <dig>  however, these above hypotheses do not explain the specific locomotor reduction during switching between light and dark conditions  <cit> . we believe that the most relevant cause is larval responses to light. therefore, based on deep sequencing data, our interpretation focuses on vision. the expression levels of dozens of retina-related genes were changed by exposure to bde <dig> . in addition, go or kegg terms such as visual perception and retinol metabolism had a relatively high significance in our enrichment analysis results .figure  <dig>

considering the essential roles of the conversion between retinol and retinal in the visual cycle and eye development, the up-regulation of retinol metabolism suggested that bde <dig> probably affected these processes. the configurations of retinal  determine their functions during the visual cycle: in the traditional rod visual cycle, 11-cis retinal is regarded as the only chromophore. however, some evidences have revealed that in the newly discovered cone visual cycle, the retina could also use all-trans retinal directly  <cit> . the expression changes of several retinol dehydrogenase -encoding genes were examined . the results revealed that expressions of 11-cis rdh genes such as rdh <dig>  rdh10b, and loc <dig> were up-regulated, as well as an all-trans rdh rdh12l. therefore, bde <dig> probably increased the photosensitive ability of zebrafish larvae and shortened their dark adaptation procedure, resulting in lack of responsiveness to changed light conditions.

the expression changes of genes in terms of visual perception indicated the possibility of abnormal eye development in larvae, which was confirmed by histological sections . for example, the down-regulated expressions of the cone-rod homeobox-encoding gene crx  and the r-cadherin-encoding gene cdh <dig>  were found in bde <dig> exposed zebarfish larvae. the deficit of the crx function led to the failure of forming the photoreceptor outer segment  and the inhibition of expressing os-specific genes  <cit> . cdh <dig> controls visual system development and functions of cell differentiation and axon migration of retina in cooperation with crx  <cit> . their simultaneous down-regulated expressions suggested the impaired development of the retina, especially of photoreceptor cells.

bde <dig> was reported to cause abnormal dorsal curvature of the trunk and tail from  <dig> hpf  <cit> , and this observation was reproduced in our experiments. we found some evidences from our sequencing results. with the exception of hsp <dig> , pth1a had the most intensive expression change among all transcripts  in 500 μg/l bde <dig> treated larvae. the gene encodes zebrafish parathyroid hormone , which regulates calcium and phosphorus concentrations, vitamin d metabolism, and bone cell activity  <cit> . increased pth could elevate the distribution of calcium in blood and restrain absorption of calcium into bones, as well as induce cathepsin proteins  <cit> . besides those transcripts in table  <dig>  several transcripts encoding other cathepsin members were up-regulated  their expressions in the complete differential expression analysis results. because of the key function of cathepsins in bone resorption, these changes indicated that the formation of larval spinal curvature was probably caused by the restricted absorption of calcium in the bone via the cooperation of pth and cathepsins. our functional enrichment analysis  also reflected the adverse impacts of bde <dig> on the larval skeletogeny process.

pbdes are known for their ability to interrupt the production, transport, and metabolism of t <dig> and t <dig>  however, our studies showed no evidence that expressions of th genes were affected by bde <dig>  including genes encoding th receptors, transthyretin, and t <dig> deiodinases. different effects of bde <dig> were seen in adults and larvae. during development, the zebrafish thyroid forms the first follicle from around  <dig> hpf  <cit> , and all the observed th changes occurred in zebrafish larvae older than that stage. these observations pose some interesting questions: when and why did bde <dig> begin to disrupt zebrafish ths? what role did bde <dig> play on the total thyroid system of the zebrafish larvae? the only affected hormone in our experiment was calcitonin, which is also secreted from the thyroid; the expression of its gene calca was moderately up-regulated . calcitonin can both respond to pth, and antagonize the biological effects of pth  <cit> . therefore, in  <dig> dpf larvae, the primary influence of bde <dig> on the thyroid was also relevant to the disturbance of bone formation.

CONCLUSIONS
in general, exposure to bde <dig> resulted in the body curvature phenotype and abnormal locomotion. distinct from the reported explanation focused on neurological factors, our transcriptomic analysis revealed that the phenotypes resulted from the exposure of bde <dig> were due to disrupt the vision and bone development in zebrafish larvae. light was a critical factor regulating fish behavior. hence, altered photosensitivity and locomotion were anticipated to have significant consequences on the prey, avoidance, and survival of zebrafish larvae. this study proposes the larval retina as a potential target organ of bde <dig> exposure. although the toxicological effects identified in this study resulted from high levels of exposure, it is likely that our findings will be helpful for understanding the underlying mechanisms and developmental consequences of the toxicity of bde <dig> and other pbde congeners in environmental situations featuring lower concentrations, but longer terms and more complex pollutant mixtures, and therefore merit further investigation.
