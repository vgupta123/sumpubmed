BACKGROUND
during the human genome project it was recognized that the mere number of protein-coding genes is much smaller than expected. in contrast, entirely new molecular mechanisms have been revealed that add to the complexity of gene regulation. in general, gene expression is regulated by protein complexes that assemble on the dna at transcription factor binding sites, which then interact with the transcriptional apparatus. with the sequencing of the human and other mammalian genomes, diverse projects were started to identify and characterize the transcribed genomic regions including their transcription start sites  and proximal regulatory sequence regions .

bioinformatic analyses of promoter dna sequences of groups of coexpressed or functionally related genes enable the discovery of gene regulatory mechanisms. in a prior study we investigated the well-characterized promoter sequence set of the essential and highly expressed human ribosomal protein  genes and succeeded in the identification of a novel specific sequence motif  <cit> . the major characteristics of the motif are the tandem atc flanks with a seven base pair  spacer, its strict orientation and its localization at approximately  <dig> bp downstream of the tss. therefore, we named it ltsm, for localized tandem sequence motif. the ltsm is situated in the first intron, except for rpl <dig> that contains such an element in its 5'-utr. moreover, we found occurrences of the motif to be evolutionarily conserved between orthologous human and mouse rp promoters.

the human ribosome consists of four rrnas and  <dig> proteins, which are encoded by  <dig> genes  <cit> . rp genes are highly and co-ordinately expressed and their tss is rigidly controlled maintaining the 5'-terminal oligo-pyrimidine tract   <cit> . 5'-tops are mrna sequence elements that have been intensively studied for their role in regulation of rp translation  <cit> . investigations of the regulation of transcription of this large but relatively homogeneous and essential group of genes established the transcription factors yy <dig>  gabp, hdref, and sp <dig> as rp gene expression regulators  <cit> .

the first main goal of the present study was the identification of further genes that might be regulated by a ltsm. by studying mouse and zebrafish rp promoters bioinformatically we first refined the definition of the ltsm sequence motif. finally, we performed a genome-wide search for genes with ltsm-bearing promoters. interestingly, the additional ltsm-positive genes mostly encode for products, which are involved in translation.

the second main goal of the study was the identification of proteins that bind ltsms and the functional characterization of the motif. here we show that the two related nucleotide binding proteins nono  and sfpq   <cit>  bind directly to ltsm sites. furthermore, we reveal that in this context nono and sfpq are not classical transcriptional regulators of rp gene expression, but rather determine the positioning of the transcriptional machinery on rp gene promoters. therewith ltsms and its binding proteins seem to contribute to the maintenance of the exact tss and to the expression level in genes involved in translation.

RESULTS
refined definition of ltsm
since evolutionary conservation of sequence features provides strong evidence for functional importance, we studied the proximal rp promoters in zebrafish  <cit> . although in zebrafish the genomic background was much more at-rich, key features of rp gene promoters, such as the tata box and the 5'-top signal were comparable between fish and mammals . in the rp promoters of zebrafish we identified a tandem motif that exhibits similar features to the mammalian ltsm: it consists of two atc flanks with a seven bp spacer, was strictly oriented and located approximately  <dig> bp downstream of the tss. the major difference between the mammalian and the fish motifs was the gc-content of the middle part, which was significantly higher in the mammalian motif. these observations led us to a refined definition of the ltsm:  <dig>  atc-atc tandem motif with a spacer of seven bp,  <dig>  located between + <dig> and + <dig> bp relative to the tss,  <dig>  strictly oriented. the base distribution of the middle part is not considered functionally constrained but rather governed by the genomic background of the actual promoter. searching the human rp promoters  with the refined motif definition revealed  <dig> hits in total,  <dig> at the preferred location and in the right orientation, two at different locations but in the right orientation and  <dig> on the reverse-complement strand at no preferred location .

we considered the distance of  <dig> bp from the first to the second t of the atc-atc tandem, which corresponds to approximately one turn of the dna double helix, an important structural feature of the motif. further, we speculated that ltsm binding complexes could allow some flexibility in the spacing of the two flanks. therefore, we searched the human rp promoters for atc-atc tandem motifs with a spacing of one bp less and one bp more than the original motif, which contains seven bp between the atc flanks . to our surprise, we found the tripartite tandem motif  in the four genes rps15a, rpl <dig>  rpl <dig> and rps <dig> in the same orientation and at the typical location relative to the tss. each is composed of three atc submotifs; the first two are separated by eight base pairs and the second and third are separated by six base pairs.

identification of additional ltsm-positive genes
we set out to screen the human genome for ltsm-positive genes to generate hypotheses about the motif's function. an important characteristic of ltsm in rp promoters was its location relative to the tss. therefore, we decided to scan ensembl human genome database version  <dig>  because it contains detailed information about transcripts including tss and exon-intron structure  <cit> . the promoter regions, - <dig> to + <dig> relative to the annotated tss, were extracted and, subsequently, the ltsm was searched on these regions in both orientations. without repeat masking there was an enrichment between positions + <dig> and + <dig> bp , although we did not find genome-wide positional enrichment in the repeat-masked promoter set . moreover, we scanned the databases dbtss and cage because they were built on sequence tags from 5'-ends of capped mrnas  <cit> . similarly, no genome-wide positional enrichment of ltsms was found in dbtss or cage derived promoter sets after repeat masking . we tested the tss predictions in the gene and transcript collections of ensembl <dig>  cage and dbtss based on our experimentally verified human rp promoter set . choosing the transcripts with the closest tss from ensembl <dig> for each rp gene yielded the best result: an average distance of seven bp to the verified tss.

we decided to focus our search on genes where ltsms appeared in a similar location relative to the tss. for each transcript in ensembl <dig> we scanned the promoter region from + <dig> to + <dig> bp relative to the tss. this resulted in  <dig> genes associated to  <dig> transcripts that carry ltsm elements . note that the larger number of transcripts compared to the number of genes arose mostly through alternative transcripts that contained the same ltsm.

interestingly, a considerable portion of ltsm-positive genes encode functional rnas . among those were  <dig> out of the  <dig> 5s ribosomal rna genes, which are transcribed by rna polymerase iii . these instances were surprising in several aspects. firstly, the distance to the tss with about  <dig> bp was considerably smaller than for the typical ltsm in rna polymerase ii  transcribed genes . secondly, the motif was found in both orientations,  <dig> on the forward strand,  <dig> on the reverse-complement strand, and  <dig> 5s-rrna promoters contained ltsm on both strands. there were no ltsm in other rrna genes in ensembl. the second multicopy rna gene with many ltsm-positive promoters was u <dig> spliceosomal rna.  <dig> of  <dig> u <dig> rna promoters contained ltsm, exclusively on the forward strand and most of them at position + <dig> bp. moreover, five out of six occurrences of the tripartite ltsm elements in the rna genes of ensembl <dig> belonged to u <dig> promoters .

ltsm-positive genes encode products belonging to the translational apparatus
a gene ontology  enrichment analysis of the ltsm-positive protein-coding genes using the ontologizer software and the parent-child method revealed that only categories related to translation were enriched among ltsm-positive genes, except for three of six genes in the purkinje cell go category  <cit> . apart from the above-mentioned rp genes we identified the translation initiation factors  <dig> subunit d and  <dig> gamma  <dig>  and the translation elongation factors 1-gamma and  <dig>  to carry ltsms in their promoters. mapping all genes with 5'-top elements of a recent study in the human genome to our list of ltsm-positive genes resulted in a minor overlap of  <dig> between the  <dig> ltsm-positive and the  <dig> top-positive genes including  <dig> rp genes  <cit> .

the ltsm is bound by nuclear proteins
we performed electromobility shift assays  with nuclear extracts of shp <dig>  cos <dig> and hek <dig> cells to show that ltsm are bound sequence-specifically by nuclear proteins. radiolabelled double stranded dna oligonucleotides harbouring the ltsm  derived from several rp promoters and unlabeled dsdna competitor probes were incubated with nuclear extracts. the sequences of ltsm-negative competitor probes were chosen from the typical ltsm location of the promoters of rps <dig> and rpl13a that are devoid of ltsms. in several experiments, we tested ltsm-positive probes from the eight rp genes rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl7a, rps <dig> and rps4x in the presence of ltsm-negative competitor probes. we found specific signals for the five genes rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and rps4x using hek <dig> cell nuclear extract . when repeating the experiments with extracts from shp <dig> and cos <dig> cells the patterns of signal intensities were comparable to those from hek <dig> cells . although the signals of the different ltsm-positive probes were specific and of the same molecular size, the intensities varied considerably and for three probes the emsa never showed a specific signal.

nono and sfpq bind to the ltsm
the probe derived from rpl <dig> showed consistently the strongest specific signals in emsa experiments. in order to identify specifically binding proteins, we generated biotinylated ltsm-positive probes from rpl <dig> and performed a protein pull-down from nuclear extracts in the presence of the unlabeled ltsm-negative rps <dig> 25mer competitor. running a protein gel resulted in three prominent bands . repeating this experiment with the unlabeled ltsm-negative rpl13a competitor resulted in three prominent bands of similar molecular weight plus an additional band at  <dig> kda. mass spectrometric analyses of the isolated protein probes revealed three predominant proteins independent of the competitor being used: the two related nucleotide binding proteins nono and sfpq and the poly-polymerase parp <dig> . all the other identified proteins achieved relatively low scores and occurred in only one of the two experiments. parp <dig> is known to bind dna ends in cellular dna repair events and to stabilize numerous transcription factors at their target dna sequences by ribosylation. thus, we focused on nono and sfpq in this work, since we considered them as more likely candidates for sequence-specific ltsm binders.

we verified the binding of nono and sfpq by pull-down assays using biotinylated ltsm-positive dsdna probes of the five genes rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and rps4x, and subsequent western blotting analyses with nono and sfpq specific antibodies . it should be noted that the ltsm-positive probes of all tested rp genes, including rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> that never showed specific signals in emsa experiments led to the pull-down of nono and sfpq , presumably for the much higher sensitivity of western blotting compared with emsa. importantly, anti-nono also binds sfpq and anti-sfpq binds nono with low affinity . the antibodies recognize epitopes of both proteins that are located in their c-terminal homologous domains, which may explain this cross-specificity  <cit> .

the surprising finding of the tripartite tandem motif  with the spacers of + <dig> and - <dig> in respect to the most common spacer of  <dig> bp motivated us to test their affinities for nono and sfpq binding. pull-down assays with nuclear extracts from hek <dig> cells confirmed that nono and sfpq bind to all three tested sequences rps15a, rpl <dig> and rps <dig> . other than these, the list contains one additional atc tandem motif with an  <dig> bp spacer at the preferred location in rpl <dig> and one tri-partite tandem motif with the first spacer of  <dig> bp and a second one of  <dig> bp in rps <dig>  whether these latter sequence elements are binding sites for nono and/or sfpq was not investigated, but it is highly probable.

further, we characterized the binding by performing emsa experiments with nuclear extracts of hek <dig> cells incubated with rpl <dig> derived probes as bait, as described above, in the presence of nono and sfpq specific antibodies in various concentrations. we found that a gradual increase in concentration for each antibody led to a gradual decrease in the intensity of the specific signals, suggesting that the antibodies interfere with the dna-binding ability of nono and sfpq . the effect appeared even stronger when adding both antibodies in equal molar amounts to the binding reaction. in the emsa experiment there appeared a second lower band in each lane, which we considered to be an unspecific signal because, firstly, it was located at exactly the same position as the strong signal in the lane without competitor and, secondly, it could not be out-competed by a specific unlabeled ltsm-positive probe.

nono and sfpq regulate the transcriptional activity in dependence of the ltsm-tss distance
to elucidate the functional role of nono and sfpq in rp gene expression we first tested whether an over expression of nono or sfpq would lead to an enhanced promoter activity in dual luciferase assays. we generated expression constructs of nono and sfpq, and a gene expression reporter construct of the promoter of rpl <dig>  which is the only rp gene that contains a ltsm element on its 5'-utr and the atg start codon on its first exon . the introduction of the reporter construct into hek <dig> cells without nono or sfpq over expression verified that the rpl <dig> gene promoter is highly active . however, the single or combined co-transfection of nono and sfpq expression constructs together with the rpl <dig> reporter construct did not lead to a further increase of the reporter signal. by titrating the reporter construct we checked that the reporter signal itself was not in the saturation region .

next, we tested the impact of the extension of the distance between tss and ltsm. we selected the typical ltsm-positive gene rpl <dig>  exon  <dig> of rpl <dig> contains the 5'-top signal and the atg start codon right before the splice site and intron  <dig> contains a ltsm at position + <dig> bp. the promoter region of rpl <dig>  was inserted into the gene trap vector pt1β-geo . the introduction of an additional xho i restriction site between the splice donor and the ltsm facilitated the insertion of an intronic linker sequence and thus an increase of the distance between tss and ltsm. linker sequences of length  <dig> and  <dig> bp led to reduced reporter signals , whereas the insertion of four bp and  <dig> bp produced similar or even stronger signals . the patterns of the mrna and protein expression of β-galactosidase showed a slightly increased signal for the construct with the four bp fill-in and a diminished signal for the longer linker sequences. please note that the location of the atg start codon on the first exon ensured that the primary transcripts were correctly spliced and translated. in particular, we observed the same length for all mature mrnas of the constructs with the various insertions . furthermore, when we inhibited nonsense-mediated decay, the signals seen before in northern blotting analyses persisted . thus, the gradual diminishing of the reporter signal could not be explained by nonsense-mediated decay. finally, we also tested the inserted sequences for the presence of potential binding sites of transcriptional repressors but did not find any.

discussion
the comparison of human, mouse and zebrafish rp promoters affirmed the functional importance of the ltsm by the rationale of phylogenetical foot printing  <cit> . this analysis provided a refined definition of ltsm, consisting of atc-flanks separated by about a full dna turn. studying ltsm elements in human and zebrafish promoters led us to the conclusion that the base distributions around the atc tandem are governed by the specific genomic backgrounds of the promoter sequences. furthermore, a detailed analysis of the base distribution in the spacer between the atc-flanks did not yet reveal characteristic patterns that could explain the highly variable signal strength in our emsas experiments . such refined experimental permutation analyses are clearly a subject for follow-up studies that, in combination with a bioinformatic scoring, could lead to a precise prediction of the affinity of ltsm variants for nono and sfpq, and the respective contribution of a ltsm in regulating the level of co-ordinated expression of a ltsm-positive gene of the translational apparatus.

the genome-wide analysis did not support a global preference for location or orientation of the ltsm relative to the tss. however, in the rp promoters of humans, mice and zebrafish ltsm elements were strictly oriented and located. and the insertion of intronic sequences between tss and ltsm into the pt1β-geo reporter construct led to decreased expression levels. the most likely explanation for our results was that the ltsm binding complex functions as transcriptional activator or enhancer with varying strength depending on its positioning relative to the transcription initiation complex or the tss. the distance between tss and ltsm could be one way to fine-tune the transcription levels of rp genes. this concept would also fit our finding that the relatively small insert of four bp led to an enhanced activity of the rp promoter construct.

with regard to possible biological functions of the motif it is intriguing that although rp genes are highly and co-ordinately expressed and the sequence motif is evolutionarily conserved, less than half  of the rp genes are ltsm-positive. even a search for degenerate motifs in the rp promoters, allowing one of the six atc-atc base pairs to deviate, did not reveal instances that cover the entire rp gene set at the preferred position, but led to a high number of questionable matches with no preferred orientation or location instead . in summary, gene annotation, scanning the literature, and sequence analysis provided no hint for what separates ltsm-positive and ltsm-negative rp genes  <cit> . for example, ltsm-positive rp genes encode parts of both the large and the small ribosomal subunits. although there was some enrichment of proteins of the large subunit to be ltsm-positive , it was not statistically significant .

the central discovery during this work was the identification of the related nucleotide binding proteins nono and sfpq as specific ltsm element binders. although the emsa experiments showed specific signals of widely varying strength and even no specific signal for three ltsm-positive probes, the pull-down of nono and sfpq with each of the tested probes establishes the specificity of our discovery. nono is highly homologous with the c-terminal part of sfpq, and nono has been shown to bind rna and single stranded dna through its n-terminus, and double stranded dna through its c-terminus  <cit> . the two proteins are parts of several complexes that are involved in a remarkable variety of nuclear processes, including regulation of transcription, splicing, nuclear retention of mrnas, double strand break rejoining, and dna relaxation; however, their exact function is still elusive in most cases  <cit> . nono and sfpq were reported to form homo- and heterodimers and the tandem repeat structure of the ltsm located on one side of the helix indicates that nono and sfpq bind dna as dimeric complexes at ltsm elements  <cit> . moreover, the discovery of the tripartite motif suggests that these proteins can even form oligomeric or at least trimeric complexes. the result of the intensity of emsa signals being dose-dependently diminished in the presence of nono and sfpq antibodies could be explained by the fact that the recognized epitopes are located in the c-terminal parts of the proteins, which are considered to contain the dna binding domain  <cit> . a second possible explanation could be that the antibodies impaired protein-protein interactions that are important for the dna-binding complex to form.

in terms of transcriptional regulation, nono and sfpq have been studied intensively as cofactors of hormone receptors, especially androgen receptor, progesterone receptor, and steroidogenic factor  <dig>  <cit> . there are conflicting reports about the functional role of nono in androgen receptor-dependent transcriptional regulation, be it coactivating or repressing  <cit> . originally, nono was identified to bind to the octamer atttgcat in immunoglobulin gene promoters  <cit> . in addition, nono and sfpq regulate transcription indirectly by influencing histone modification and topoisomerase activity  <cit> . in particular, the two proteins were shown to mediate the binding of histone deacetylases through msin3a to nuclear receptors and inhibit transcription  <cit> .

the results of our reporter assays favour an activating or enhancing function of nono and sfpq on rp gene transcription by binding ltsm elements. however, the co-transfection of nono and sfpq expressing constructs and the rpl <dig> reporter construct did not lead to an increased reporter signal. a likely explanation of this result is that the extraordinarily active rpl <dig> promoter and the transcription factor levels are already optimized such that it is hardly possible to achieve a further increase with manipulations of any nature. another explanation could be that the ltsm helps to recruit and orient the rna polymerase complex, but is not a rate-limiting step in transcription. this explanation is consistent with the strong position-dependent requirements of ltsm to the tss  and may explain why no further signal increase was observed following over expression of nono and sfpq in the reporter gene assay .

the genome-wide investigation of ltsm-positive genes extended the target scope of the proposed transcriptional mechanism. apart from rp genes, the go analysis revealed ltsm-positive genes that encode other components of the translational machinery such as eif3d. most puzzling was the incidence of ltsm elements in 5s rrna promoters. firstly, in contrast to the rp genes, ltsms occurred closer to the tss at approximately + <dig> bp and on both strands. secondly, in contrast to all other ltsm-positive genes 5s rrna is transcribed by pol-iii. classical investigations had shown that the transcription of 5s rrna genes in xenopus laevis is primarily controlled by the internal control region at + <dig> to + <dig> bps, which is essential for the determination of the correct positioning of pol-iii  <cit> . the presence of ltsm elements in the core promoter of more than half of the 5s rrna genes gave rise to the hypothesis that ltsm is involved in the coordination of transcription of parts of the translational apparatus. it should be noted that we found no more ltsm elements in promoters of other rrna genes or other pol-iii targets in ensembl <dig> 

additionally, our genome-wide analysis revealed a number of ltsm-positive genes that encode proteins involved in transcription, splicing, mrna processing and apparently unrelated processes. like u <dig> snrnp and other splicing factors nono and sfpq bind the c-terminal domain of rna pol-ii and can interact directly with the 5'-splice site  <cit> . if confirmed, the transcriptional regulation of splicing factors, including u <dig> spliceosomal rna, by nono and sfpq would add another level of regulation to the well-documented direct involvement of nono and sfpq in splicing reactions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
bioinformatic analyses of genomic sequences are a powerful tool in predicting sequence elements with potential biological importance. however, a mere data mining with bioinformatic methods is often considered as a theoretical exercise by experimental geneticists. the here exploited synergistic application of bioinformatic and experimental techniques adds another example for the validity of in silico methods for the identification of players involved in the regulation of biological processes. the previously described ltsm was refined and verified experimentally in this study, and the here found ltsm-binding proteins nono and sfpq were only discovered as regulators of the expression of a set of genes of the translational apparatus by the predictive power of a conspicuous sequence element. the finding that these two transcription factors play a role in a tss-ltsm distance-dependent manner opens an entry for further investigative approaches to fully disclose the role of ltsm and its binders, nono and sfpq, in how the translational apparatus is co-ordinately expressed.
