BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis encompasses the complex differentiation that converts cells of the male germline into haploid, motile spermatozoa. it involves three major phases. spermatogonia derived throughout adult life from the germinal stem cells multiply by mitosis and commit to differentiation. germ cells become spermatocytes as they enter meiosis, which will generate haploid progeny. the resultant spermatids then complete the conversion from a round, immotile cell, to the elongated, free-swimming sperm. the renewal of the germinal stem cells, the proliferation of differentiating spermatogonia, and the commitment to enter meiosis are controlled by extracellular signaling molecules provided by somatic cells of the testis . successful completion of meiosis depends on androgen stimulation of sertoli cells . while initiation and completion of meiosis in the testis normally depend on external cues and perhaps the physiological environment of the tubule, much of male meiosis is undoubtedly controlled by an intrinsic genetic program.

regulatory factor x  <dig>  is an example of a transcription factor  that may be part of such an intrinsic program of spermatocyte differentiation. the rfx family consists of  <dig> related proteins  . rfx1- <dig> have conserved dna binding domains, recognize the same consensus binding site and can generally form homo and heterodimers with one another via conserved carboxyl-terminal dimerization domains. rfx <dig>  while sharing the dna binding domain with the others, lacks the dimerization domain and is chiefly devoted to regulation of genes that are part of the class ii major histocompatibility complex   <cit> . while elevated expression of rfx1- <dig> in mouse testis was noted over a decade ago  <cit> , and rfx <dig> more recently , the more recent discovery of an x box motif  <cit>  in the proximal promoter of the histone h1t gene  <cit>  sparked attention to the rfx family in the context of spermatogenesis. while rfx1- <dig> are all expressed at high levels in haploid cells, only rfx <dig> is up-regulated in meiotic cells to generate a full-length, functional protein  <cit> . further, rfx <dig> is the family member whose expression is most narrowly confined to testis  <cit> .

in the present work we set out to identify additional rfx <dig> targets among pachytene-expressed genes, and also to search the rfx <dig> promoter for clues to upstream regulatory links. we accomplished both goals. in the case of the rfx <dig> promoter, we found a cluster of binding sites for the myb family of transcription factors. this was of striking interest because a-myb knockout mice undergo complete spermatogenic arrest at the pachytene stage of spermatogenesis  <cit> . the myb family, identified initially from two oncogenic chicken retroviruses, consists of three proteins in vertebrates with a conserved and ancient dna binding domain  <cit> . myb , the cellular source of the oncogene, is most prevalent in bone marrow and is essential for development of the hematopoietic system  <cit> . b-myb  is expressed in all proliferating cells  <cit> . a-myb , is expressed highly in testis, in certain stages of b-cell development, the cns, and is necessary for mammary gland proliferation  <cit> . thus a-myb is the family member with most specific relevance to spermatogenesis both in terms of expression pattern and by the ko mouse phenotype  <cit> .

in work to be described we have accumulated evidence that a-myb is indeed a regulator of the rfx <dig> promoter. we have also shown that the germline-specific alf gene, which encodes a variant of general transcription factor tfiia  <cit> , is likely subject to rfx <dig> control. taken together, these results suggest that rfx <dig> serves as a downstream amplifier of a-myb regulation and provide preliminary support to a model in which a-myb, rfx <dig>  and alf may form connected links in part of the intrinsic spermatogenic control program during meiosis.

RESULTS
identification of additional rfx <dig> target genes
transcription factors are typically used to regulate multiple genes, and it seems likely that more potential rfx <dig> targets exist among pachytene up-regulated genes than those presently identified . to identify additional targets, we manually searched for x boxes in promoter regions of genes identified by array screens as showing up-regulation in the testis between  <dig> and  <dig> days of age  <cit> , the period in which pachytene cells first appear  <cit> . we identified high quality x box motif matches in promoter regions for phosducin-like  <dig> , sperm antigen  <dig>  and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase  <dig>  .

considering this group of pachytene-expressed genes, the x boxes display a range of variations on the ideal sequence, which is an inverted repeat of the half site gttgcc, with a spacer of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . the binding affinity of the x boxes may be a guide to the sensitivity of the different promoters to increases in rfx <dig> expression. we therefore ranked the binding motifs by competitive emsa analysis. we first used a specific rfx <dig> antibody to show that pachytene spermatocyte cell extracts generated a prominent rfx <dig> complex with representative oligos . from previous experiments, the major band shifted by the rfx antibody could be assigned to an rfx <dig> homodimer  <cit> . this assignment is also supported by the fact that rfx <dig> is the only family member expressed at high levels in spermatocytes  <cit> . as a result the excess of rfx <dig> causes nearly all of the less prevalent rfx <dig> to occur as an rfx1:rfx <dig> heterodimer, which migrates more slowly due to the larger size of rfx <dig> <cit>  . the pachytene extract was then used for competition gel shifts with different x box oligos as unlabeled competitors . the rfx <dig> homodimer band was quantitated by phosphorimaging and results plotted . binding affinities for the individual sites are clearly determined by their relatedness to the ideal perfect inverted repeat . the three newly identified x boxes  are, along with alf , the strongest binding sites yet identified in testis-expressed genes.

alf is a potential rfx <dig> target
alf is a particularly interesting rfx <dig> target, because, as a variant general transcription factor, it has potential to modulate transcriptional patterns in subsequent phases of spermatogenesis  <cit> . thus alf is a possible forward link in the program of differentiation that directs spermatogenesis. to obtain additional evidence for a role of rfx <dig> in the activation of the alf promoter, we wanted to show that co-expression of rfx <dig> would lead to up-regulation of an alf-driven reporter in transfected cells. transactivation by rfx <dig> has not been well studied, but it has substantial homology with rfx <dig> between the dna binding domain and the carboxyl terminus  <cit> . rfx <dig> has a transcriptional inhibitory domain that overlaps the c-terminal dimerization domain such that deletion of much of the carboxyl terminus generates a protein with substantially greater activation activity  <cit> . in preliminary experiments we established that full length rfx <dig> did not transactivate a simple x-box reporter plasmid  or a luciferase reporter driven by the alf promoter in mouse nih 3t <dig> cells . we therefore generated a series of deletions running throughout the rfx <dig> carboxyl terminal region. of these the most active removed amino acids between  <dig> and  <dig>  which is similar to one of the most active rfx <dig> deletions described by katan et al.  <cit> . this rfx <dig> del- <dig> variant conveyed substantial activation to the x box reporter plasmid . importantly, rfx <dig> del- <dig> also imparted a three-fold activation to a minimal alf promoter linked to luciferase . in order to show that activation of the alf promoter depends on the x-box, we mutated it . the construct with a mutant alf promoter lost responsiveness to rfx <dig> expression . this result demonstrates that truncated rfx <dig> will activate the alf promoter via its x box.

if rfx <dig> is indeed a transcriptional modulator of the alf gene, then it should be bound to the alf promoter in vivo. we next carried out chip assays to verify this prediction . immuno enrichment for chromatin fragments carrying rfx <dig> led to selective recovery of the alf promoter region, whereas no selective recovery was found for an irrelevant dna region of the tcrd gene . this result confirms that rfx <dig> is part of the alf promoter ensemble during spermatogenesis.

the rfx <dig> promoter
with a number of plausible rfx <dig> target genes identified, we turned our attention to the transcriptional control of rfx <dig> itself. our hope was to link rfx <dig> up-regulation in pachytene cells to a specific factor or factors that control an upstream step in spermatogenic differentiation. the immediate 5'-region of the mouse rfx <dig> gene lies in an  <dig>  kb sequence that fits the criteria of a cpg island  <cit>  . it lacks a tata box and, based on the recovery of 5'-race clones distributed over a 120-bp region   <cit> , has a dispersed rather than a focused transcriptional start site  <cit> . inspection of this region with a web-based search protocol  <cit>  identified potential binding sites for a number of common transcription factors. a cluster of sites about  <dig> bp upstream of the assigned database cap site was striking . this includes two perfect gc boxes for sp1/ <dig> in addition to multiple imperfect gc boxes typical of a cpg island. a perfect caat box lies slightly farther upstream and is an excellent match to the extended consensus binding site for nfy  <cit> . of special note is a complex of three rfx half sites, suggesting an element of auto-regulation. finally, the presence of three sequences with perfect matches to the myb binding site  consensus   <cit>  was particularly relevant considering that mice with a homozygous null allele for a-myb display spermatogenic arrest at pachytene  <cit> . mbs- <dig> , nearest the transcriptional start, is unusual by being repeated on the complementary strand with a  <dig> bp displacement, thus forming a partially overlapping pair of inverted sites. mbs- <dig> is rendered even more complex because it also lies within the two upstream rfx half sites. this tight cluster of mbss immediately suggested that they might impart a-myb regulation to rfx <dig>  our consideration of this possibility was reinforced by the fact that the three myb sites, along with most of the others mentioned above, are well conserved among a variety of mammals  <cit> . 

the role of myb binding sites in the rrx <dig> promoter
our first step in examining the possible functional role of these motifs was to test them for myb binding affinity. the three cellular myb proteins share a conserved amino terminal tripartite dna binding domain and recognize the same sequence motif  <cit> . one of the complexities of the myb family is the presence of a carboxyl inhibitory domain  <cit> , which inhibits dna binding as well as transcriptional activation  <cit> , particularly for a-myb  <cit> . for binding studies we therefore used a bacterially expressed fusion protein containing amino acids 1- <dig> of a-myb. oligos were prepared for the rfx <dig> mbs- <dig> and mbs- <dig> sites as well as the chicken mim- <dig> mbs a site  <cit> , which is an unusually strong mbs. preliminary mobility shift experiments established that each of the motifs from rfx <dig> binds specifically to the fusion protein but that none is as strong as the mim- <dig> site, which depends on the at run at its downstream side for its unusual character  <cit> . to compare these sites side-by-side we performed a competition assay in which the rfx <dig> mbs- <dig> oligo was radioactively labeled and the different mbs oligos were used as unlabeled competitors . both rfx <dig> mbs- <dig> and mbs- <dig> were comparable as competitors, while the mim-1-a site was clearly stronger. a control oligo with a perfect gc box failed to compete at the concentrations tested. in other experiments we showed that the mbs- <dig> site has a binding affinity comparable to mbs- <dig> and - <dig> .

we next asked whether the cluster of mbss would impart myb responsiveness to the rfx <dig> promoter in co-transfection experiments. a promoter fragment from - <dig> to + <dig>  was cloned into the pgl <dig> luciferase reporter. two subfragments of the promoter containing either just the cluster of mbss or an extended fragment  were cloned into ppoly-ew5-e1b-luc. preliminary experiments using an expression vector for full length a-myb indicated that no stimulation was imparted to the rfx <dig> pfa region over a range of plasmid dna concentrations. removal of the carboxyl inhibitory domain generates a protein with greater activation potential that is less dependent on the promoter-cell line combination used. using a c-terminal truncated version of a-myb, we established that polya-ew5-e1b-luc  <cit> , which contains  <dig> mim-1-a sites joined head to tail upstream of the adeno e1b core promoter, responded in a dose-dependent manner to co-transfection with the truncated a-myb expression vector in nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts . experiments then showed that the longest rfx <dig> promoter fragment  was stimulated 3-fold by co-transfection with truncated a-myb . this effect is specific since the a-myb expression vector had no significant effect on the tk-driven renilla luciferase gene used as an internal control in transfection experiments. with the promoter subfragments pfb and pfc, this stimulation increased to the  <dig> to  <dig> fold range, although the absolute magnitude of stimulation was less . somewhat surprisingly, the absolute activity was comparable regardless of whether the adjacent caat and gc elements were present  or not  . these results demonstrate that an a-myb expression vector conveys stimulation to the natural promoter of the rfx <dig> gene and that stimulation is retained by subfragments centered on the three mbss.

we then tested each mbs individually by ligating  <dig> copies in a head to tail fashion into ppolya-ew5-e1b-luc from which the mim- <dig> mbs sequences had been excised. while fold activations varied widely , both mbs- <dig> and - <dig> imparted an a-myb-stimulated activity equal or greater than that of the widely used mim- <dig> sequence . mbs- <dig> generated the greatest and mbs- <dig> the least absolute stimulation. it is possible that differences in transcriptional activation by the individual concatenated sites were due in part to accidental creation of binding motifs through the ligation sites. this remains to be investigated. taken together, the results described thus far show that the three putative mbs sites have comparable myb-binding activity and that they can convey transcriptional activation, either as concatenated 5-mers or when present as a mixed cluster within the rfx <dig> promoter.

we then carried out chip assays to test whether a-myb is associated with the rfx <dig> promoter in vivo in testis germ cells . an a-myb-specific antibody selectively enriched for rfx <dig> promoter sequences from mixed germ cells, a result not obtained for a control sequence in the irrelevant tcrd locus. thus chip confirmed that a-myb is indeed found on the rfx <dig> promoter in vivo.

rfx <dig> expression in a-myb ko mice
if rfx <dig> expression is dependent on a-myb, then rfx <dig> should be dramatically diminished in testes from a-myb knockout mice. tissues from a-myb ko mice and wild-type  littermates were kindly made available to us by e. p. reddy. we examined rfx expression, first by western blotting of total protein extracts prepared from knockout mice and their normal littermates. the prominent testis rfx <dig> band identified in wt testes was nearly undetectable in the testes of a-myb ko mice . we used the transcription factor sp <dig> as a control as its expression is highest in non-germinal cells and in early germ cells  <cit> . its level was not reduced in the ko testes. extracts from liver and kidney, which do not express significant rfx <dig>  <cit> , served as controls to demonstrate the antibody specificity. rfx1- <dig> have different patterns of expression during spermatogenesis  <cit> , and we determined the transcript levels of each in the ko mice using quantitative real-time pcr . expression of all family members was reduced in the ko mice, with the greatest changes seen for rfx <dig> and rx <dig>  rfx <dig> expression in testis occurs only from downstream promoters activated in spermatocytes and spermatids  <cit> , and the virtual absence of rfx <dig> transcripts agrees with the absence of cells beyond early pachytene. rfx <dig> transcripts were decreased to less than one percent of wild type animals. as reference genes with known expression patterns, we also examined c-kit, h1t and ldhc by real-time pcr . c-kit, which is expressed in differentiated spermatogonia  <cit> , was elevated in ko testes, likely because the ko testes are relatively enriched for these cells compared to wild type. h1t, which is expressed at a low level in early spermatocytes, but primarily in mid to late pachytene cells, was reduced to 3% of wt. ldhc, which is expressed prior to pachytene at low levels but significantly upregulated in pachytene  <cit> , was reduced to essentially undetectable levels. these results confirm that spermatogenesis is arrested in a-myb ko mice during meiosis and, in particular, document that rfx <dig> expression is strikingly reduced.

contrast of a- and b-myb expression during spermatogenesis
expression of a-myb and b-myb in mouse testis has been investigated at the mrna level by several techniques  <cit> . these studies showed that b-myb expression is restricted to early germ cells, likely to be spermatogonia, but that a-myb expression, in contrast, peaked in meiotic cells. since expression of these proteins in the testis has not been studied at the level of immunohistology, we thought it worthwhile to investigate their expression patterns in histological cross sections of mouse testis. b-myb  was located exclusively in the outermost germ cell layer lying next to the peritubular cells that define the outer perimeter of seminiferous tubules. the histological patterns of germ cell associations seen in different tubules define  <dig> stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium  <cit> , and both spermatogonia and meiotic cells up to early pachytene are found in the outermost layer. regardless of the stage of the cycle, the only cells with bright nuclear fluorescence lay within the outermost germ layer. the majority of these were in pre-leptotene to early pachytene. some spermatogonia were likely identified as well though these cells are more difficult to identify by the fixation and staining procedures employed. immune detection was rapidly lost as early pachytene spermatocytes moved away from the peritubular cells and entered the mid-pachytene phase of meiosis. in contrast, immunoreactivity for a-myb identified essentially a completely different population of germ cell nuclei . spermatogonia and early spermatocytes in the outermost germ cell layer were not a-myb positive, but meiotic nuclei of mid-pachytene and later were readily labeled . immunoreactivity was retained in early round haploid cells  seen in fig. 7d. immunoreactivity was significantly less in late round spermatids just about to undergo nuclear elongation . condensed spermatid nuclei near the center of the tubules did not react with anti a-myb . sertoli cell nuclei, which are largely found at the periphery of the tubules, did not react with the antibody. these results confirm that there is a marked difference in the expression of these two myb factors and that little overlap occurs as detected by immunofluorescence.

as a final approach to confirm the cell-type distribution of a- and b-myb, we applied quantitative real-time pcr to estimate mrna levels during development of the first cohorts of spermatogenic cells in young mice . because the first wave of development is relatively synchronous and well characterized, we could correlate the progression of the most advanced cells with the age of the animals  <cit> . b-myb mrna remained essentially constant from  <dig> days, when the most advanced cells are differentiated a and b spermatogonia, through to adulthood, when the most prevalent cells are spermatocytes and spermatids. in contrast, levels of a-myb transcripts rose continuously throughout development, indicating that maturing germ cells contribute significantly to the a-myb transcript pool. we also determined rfx <dig> transcripts, and in view of our proposed functional connection between a-myb and rfx <dig>  it is interesting to note that rfx <dig> expression is similar to but lags slightly behind that of a-myb. .

discussion
the work presented serves to direct attention toward a possible functional connection between the transcriptional regulators a-myb, rfx <dig>  and alf. each is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner but is particularly prominent in the male germ line beginning during the pachytene period of meiotic prophase i. a complex process of cellular differentiation such as spermatogenesis must involve progressive changes in structural and enzymatic proteins but also in regulatory proteins such as transcription factors. a-myb is clearly an essential gene regulator in pachytene  <cit> . however, its essential target genes have not been determined. in view of the results presented here we propose that a-myb signaling is broadened and extended by rfx <dig>  which is assumed to act both on genes for structural proteins used during spermatogenesis  and proteins actually present in sperm , but also on genes such as alf, that are likely to promote yet further changes in gene expression. while there are other rfx factors expressed in male germ cells, rfx <dig> is the only one that is significantly elevated in pachytene cells  <cit>  and is thus the most likely to effect new gene expression at this point. these connections remain tentative because they are based primarily on correlations due to the difficulty of manipulating gene function directly in the testis.

in the first part of this work we identified three new potential rfx <dig> target genes that are sharply up-regulated during pachytene, a point in meiosis at which the fundamental events of chromosome pairing and the initiation of recombination events have already occurred, and early expression of genes that will eventually generate the distinctive features of a sperm has begun. pdcl <dig> encodes a protein related to phosducin, a heterotrimeric g-protein modulator in the retina  <cit> . by reference to the role of the ortholog in yeast, pdcl <dig> is likely important for formation of haploid cells, although its exact function is not yet understood  <cit> . spag <dig> encodes a protein that functions as part of the central axoneme of the sperm flagellum. knockouts for spag <dig> are infertile due to motility and morphological defects but also have severe hydrocephaly, apparently reflecting ciliary defects in brain ependymal cells  <cit>  . adam <dig> is part of a large family of transmembrane proteins that can serve as integrin ligands. while it is detected in the embryonic prospermatogonia  <cit> , it is also expressed during spermatogenesis and appears on the mature sperm surface after undergoing proteolytic processing in the epididymis  <cit> . these three genes have x box motifs with strong binding affinities and each shows marked up-regulation in developing testes at a point coincident with early entry into pachytene  <cit> . interestingly, h1t, perhaps the first spermatogenic gene identified with an x box-containing promoter  <cit> , has a low affinity x box, which may account in part for the delayed appearance of h1t in mid/late pachytene  <cit> . convincing support for the role of rfx <dig> in regulating these genes will require a combination of analysis of targeted x box mutations in transgenic mice as well as the targeted elimination or knockdown of rfx <dig>  however, it would be surprising if the  <dig> bp long x box motif was found by chance in the promoter regions of all of these genes.

alf is a variant of general transcription factor iia that is expressed both in oocytes and spermatocytes, and is a member of a small family of variant forms of core promoter factors that is often restricted to or expressed maximally in the gonads  <cit> . in some cases, such as trf <dig>  a variant of tata box binding protein , or of taf4b, a tata box associated factor variant, mice with targeted null mutations undergo arrested spermatogenesis, documenting the critical importance of these general tf variants  <cit> . in the case of alf, results for a knockout mouse are not available, but, in view of the important role of these other general tf variants, it is prudent to consider that it imparts selectivity to gene expression in pachytene or later. kim et al.  <cit>  first noted that the alf promoter region contains a strong x box motif and showed that an emsa band obtained with a promoter fragment and a liver extract was eliminated by an rfx <dig> antibody. we have extended these observations and shown that the minimal alf promoter is responsive through its x box in transfected cells to co-expression of truncated rfx <dig>  further, we showed by chip analysis that the alf promoter is occupied by rfx <dig> in testis germ cells. for these reasons we speculate that alf is a genuine rfx <dig> target. as an incidental aspect of this study, we showed for the first time that rfx <dig>  like rfx <dig>  <cit>  has an auto-regulatory carboxyl terminal domain that inhibits transcriptional activation . thus deletion of most of the carboxyl terminus generated a form of the rfx <dig> with greatly enhanced transcriptional activation on either a reporter with multimerized x boxes or one driven by the alf promoter. the need to use a truncated form of rfx <dig> to achieve transactivation presumably indicates that nih 3t <dig> cells lack important tissue-specific factors that would normally neutralize the rfx <dig> inhibitory domains.

in discussion of the role of x box motifs, it should be pointed out that x box motifs are prevalent within conserved noncoding sequence elements in the human genome  <cit> . the significance of this observation is unknown, but these conserved regions were not confined to promoters. of more relevance here, a functional genomics analysis of transcription factor binding sites that are over-represented in the immediate promoters of tissue-enriched/specific genes identified the x box motif only within the testis set  <cit> . our focus here is on the pachytene phase of meiosis, but there may well be additional genes controlled by rfx factors in the haploid phase of spermatogenesis.

changing our attention to possible upstream regulation of the rfx <dig> gene, we identified strong binding motifs in the rfx <dig> promoter for a number of transcription factors. of interest is the fact that a set of x box half sites occurs as part of the larger cluster of sites. the rfx family is unusual in that at least some members, though functionally dimers, can bind to half sites  <cit> . in the rfx <dig> promoter the downstream pair of half sites occurs in the classic inverted arrangement, whereas the remaining upstream half site is either a singleton or might be considered a reversed inversion . we have shown that indeed this region will bind rfx <dig> in pachytene extracts  but have not investigated the roles of the individual half sites. these sites suggest that some form of auto regulation may occur for rfx <dig>  but do not indicate whether it is positive or negative. in this regard it is interesting that rfx <dig> has been shown to repress its own promoter through a pair of relatively distant half sites  <cit> .

in light of the finding that a-myb knockout mice undergo spermatogenic arrest in pachytene  <cit> , the most dramatic feature of the rfx <dig> promoter to us was the set of three myb binding sites with excellent matches to the established consensus. a-myb, though similar to both myb and b-myb, has a distinctly different expression pattern and generates a completely distinct phenotype when eliminated thorough targeted mutation  <cit> . in particular, a-myb is the only myb member with high level expression in developing male germ cells beyond the early proliferative phase. we have confirmed by immunohistochemistry the generally different expression of b- and a-myb reported in the literature, but observed somewhat finer differences than could be detected by the in situ hybridization techniques used in the past. while b-myb was expressed strongly up to the early pachytene stage of meiosis, a-myb was expressed strongly only as b-myb disappeared, in spermatocytes passing from early to middle pachytene. morphologically this corresponds to the point at which the spermatocytes are clearly moving away from their initial residence along the wall of the seminiferous tubule. accordingly, a-myb is expressed in the testis in cells that have completed their final s-phase, attained the point in meiosis in which chromosomes are fully synapsed and early recombination events have occurred, and the future sperm are beginning to take on aspects of their terminal differentiation.

we showed that each of the three myb motifs functioned as a binding site in vitro and also that multimers of each would convey myb-dependent activation to a reporter gene. further, both the whole rfx <dig> promoter as well as a small segment containing the three mbss were a-myb responsive. chip also confirmed that a-myb is bound to the promoter in vivo. finally, in testes from a-myb ko mice, the levels of rfx <dig> as well as rfx <dig> mrna were greatly reduced. in view of the fact that many established myb target genes contain multiple promoter mbss  <cit> , our results are entirely consistent with a model in which a-myb is a direct transcriptional activator of rfx <dig> 

a complexity of both rfx <dig> and a-myb is that these transcription factors are characterized by auto-regulation. in both cases carboxyl terminal domains inhibit amino terminal transactivation domains  <cit> . in the case of a-myb, this effect extends to marked inhibition of dna binding activity  <cit> , meaning that it would be difficult to identify in nuclear extracts by the usual emsa procedures. this is a relatively unusual property of a transcription factor, but has, for example, been well characterized for ets <dig> and some of its relatives  <cit> . presumably a reason for such autoregulation is to make individual factors dependent on the particular mix of other dna binding factors or co-regulators present, so as to minimize functional consequences from binding to random genomic sites. unfortunately the lack of cell lines that retain an ability to undergo meiosis in vitro hampers the study of spermatogenic transcription factors in their home environment. in fact full understanding of factors or modifications that render either rfx or myb proteins functional on genuine target promoters is very incomplete, except for the elegantly worked out but specialized case of rfx <dig>  <cit> .

that individual myb factors do have specific in vivo targets is evident from the effects of knockout mice, but has also been shown dramatically by gene array screens following over expression of individual factors by the ness laboratory  <cit> . some progress has been made in identifying cellular mechanisms for overcoming autoregulation in the case of myb proteins. thus, dash et al.  <cit>  have shown that the amino and carboxyl ends of myb self-associate to bring about silencing, and that p <dig>   <cit>  can overcome this negative auto-regulation. however, p <dig> is widely expressed and may not be the explanation for the promoter-specific effects of myb. similarly, it is well known that transcription factor ets- <dig> can promote the transcriptional activity of both myb and a-myb  <cit> . a  <dig> kda protein was identified that binds to a-myb  <cit> . its presence was correlated with the transcriptional activity of a-myb in b cell lines and its absence with lack of a-myb activity in t cell lines  <cit> . unfortunately this  <dig> kda protein has not been further characterized. it is not surprising that a-myb is also subject to activating  <cit>  and inhibitory  <cit>  phosphorylations that can play tissue-specific roles. clearly considerable work remains to be done to understand why a- and b-myb seem to have such different roles during spermatogenesis and what the complete roll of rfx <dig> may be. the present study reports observations that suggest the a-myb - rfx <dig> - alf connection could be an important part of the final picture.

CONCLUSIONS
the rfx family of transcription factors is broadly up-regulated in post-meiotic cells, whereas rfx <dig> alone is up-regulated during the later phases of meiosis. this suggests that rfx <dig> modulates gene expression during pachytene, and we have identified three additional pachytene-expressed genes with x-box-containing promoters. several experiments implicated the promoter of variant general transcription factor alf as an rfx <dig> target. we also determined that rfx <dig> is itself likely subject to transcriptional regulation by a-myb, which is essential for completion of meiosis in mice. putting these several observations together, we hypothesize that rfx <dig>  and its downstream targets, such as alf, are part of a transcriptional control program that depends on a-myb. more remains to be done to establish this conjecture, but it does provide a framework to ask testable questions.
