BACKGROUND
in recent years, the discovery of numerous small rnas has a great deal of interest in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation during development and other biological processes. small rnas  include several kinds of short non-coding rnas, such as microrna , small interfering rna , and piwi-associated rna , which all regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. the srna content of plant cells is surprisingly complex, suggesting an extensive regulatory role for these molecules  <cit> . the best-characterized class of plant srnas is mirnas  <cit> . typically, mirnas are approximately  <dig> nucleotide small-rna sequences that play key roles in many diverse biological processes, including development, viral defense, metabolism and apoptosis  <cit> .

micrornas  are generated from precursor rna  with hairpin structures by dicer-like  <dig>   <cit> . dcl <dig> trims the hairpin structure , and then a further cleavage by the same enzyme releases the mirna/mirna* duplex  <cit> . this duplex has a 2-nt 3-overhang at each side and contains a few mismatches  <cit> . one of the strands of the generated mirna/mirna* duplex is incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex . this strand is usually the mature mirna strand and the mirna* strand gets degraded, although in some cases the mirna* strand also accumulates at a lower level  <cit> . the incorporated mature mirna guides risc to mrnas containing a target site and risc down-regulates the expression of the mrna. the 'seed' region located at mirna nucleotides 2- <dig> is the most important sequence for interaction with mrna targets  <cit> . in plants the target site shows near perfect complementarity to the mirna sequence, and as a consequence most target mrnas are cleaved by risc, although there are examples where the translation of the mrna is suppressed without a cleavage  <cit> .

micrornas' regulatory role has been exemplified by the critical regulatory behavior of mirnas at key positions in a variety of pathways, such as root  <cit> , shoot  <cit> , leaf  <cit> , flower development  <cit>  and cell fate  <cit> . additionally, they also include responses to phytohormones  <cit> , nutrient  <cit>  and other environmental stresses  <cit> . furthermore, the targets of several mirnas are genes that play important roles in stress tolerance, including the gene encoding cu/zn sod  <cit> . mir <dig> targets auxin receptor genes, such as tir <dig>  afb <dig> and afb <dig>  which lower auxin signals and inhibit the pathogen p. syringae  <cit> . mirnas are also induced by pathogens, which suggests mirnas are involved in plant-microorganism interactions such as symbiosis events with legumes and rhizobia bacteria  <cit> . increasing evidence demonstrates that mirnas might provide a novel platform to better understand plant development and resistance to biotic as well as abiotic stresses.

currently,  <dig>  mature mirnas have been discovered and deposited in the public available mirna database mirbase   <cit> . these mirnas include  <dig>  mirnas from  <dig> plant species. the study of small rnas in maize has been reported but compared with other crops such as rice the number of maize mirnas identified so far is relatively small  <cit> . the number of maize mirnas is even smaller than that of arabidopsis though maize genome size is much larger than that of arabidopsis. to date, there are  <dig> maize mirnas,  <dig> rice mirnas and  <dig> arabidopsis mirnas in mirbase. the identification of a near complete set of small rnas in any organism is of fundamental importance to understanding small rna-mediated gene regulations and the diversity of small rnas. it lays the necessary foundation for unavailing the complex small rna-mediated regulatory networks. maize is an obvious choice for high-throughput small rna sequencing, because of its worldwide agricultural importance, besides being a c <dig> plant with a sequenced genome.

the most challenging problem in understanding plant mirnas is to identify more novel mirnas. three major approaches have been used for mirna discovery in plants: forward genetics, bioinformatics prediction as well as direct cloning and sequencing. only a few mirnas were identified by forward genetic studies and predicting species-specific mirnas using bioinformatics method was difficult  <cit> . thus, direct cloning and sequencing is the most effective method for plant mirna discovery. recently, the deep sequencing technology has revolutionized small rna discovery and more and more mirnas have been identified. this study leads to the confirmation of the authenticity of  <dig> known mirnas and the discovery of  <dig> novel ones in maize. identification of novel mirnas results in significant enrichment of the repertoire of maize mirnas and provides insights into mirna regulation of genes expressed in imbibed seed.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of maize short rnas
in order to identify the mirnas involved in the very early stage of seed germination, a small rna library from maize seed  <dig> hours after imbibition was sequenced by the solexa technology. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained. after removing the low quality sequences and adapter sequences,  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained with 18-30nt in length . we then further removed sequences that were read only once and  <dig> , <dig> reads remained. next, all solexa reads were aligned against the maize b <dig> refgen_v <dig>  using soap and  <dig> , <dig> reads were perfectly matched to the maize genome  <cit> , representing  <dig> % of the total reads. around  <dig> % of the distinct reads matched noncoding rnas including rrnas , trnas , snrnas , sirnas  and snornas , which accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads . all the sequences excluding noncoding rnas were then regarded as mirnas for further analysis.

in maize, the size of the small rnas was not evenly distributed. among these sequences shown in figure  <dig>  the number of 24nt sequences was significantly greater than other sequences and accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads. this result was consistent with that of medicago truncatula  <cit> , rice  <cit> , peanut  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . however, the size distribution differed from wheat and conifer mirnas obtained through  <dig> high-throughput sequencing  <cit>  and chinese yew sequences obtained through solexa technology  <cit> . in conifer, the fraction of 24nt micrornas was very small  due to the lack of dcl <dig>  the enzyme that matured 24nt rnas in angiosperms  <cit> . the next larger fractions were the 22nt , 21nt  and 20nt  fractions, representing the typical length of plant mature mirnas. intriguingly, the fraction of 23nt mirnas was very small  compared to those of  <dig>   <dig> and 24nt fractions. the same phenomenon was also observed in peanut  <cit> , cotton  <cit>  and medicago truncatula  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the abundance of mirnas in our dataset varied drastically. some were sequenced only a few times, whereas others were present thousands of times, indicating many physiological and biochemical processes are being carried out and maize seed contains a large and diverse small rna population at the very early stage of seed germination.

identification of conserved maize mirnas
conserved mirna families are found in many plant species and have important functions in plant development. to identify conserved mirnas in our dataset, all small rna sequences were blastn searched against the known maize mature mirnas and their precursors in the mirna database mirbase. there are currently  <dig> families containing  <dig> known mirnas in mirbase. blastn searches showed that  <dig> , <dig> total reads representing  <dig> unique srnas matched to known maize mirnas. further analysis identified a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas that belong to  <dig> mirna families . the identified mirna families have been shown conserved in a variety of plant species. for example, mir156/ <dig>  mir159/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> have been found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> plant species, respectively  <cit> . maize mirna families displayed significantly varied abundance from each other. this varied abundance of the mirna families suggested that mirna genes would be differentially transcribed at this very early stage of seed germination. for example, the majority of maize mirnas were only sequenced less than  <dig>  times, and some rare mirnas were detected less than  <dig> times, whereas zma-mir167a, zma-mir166a, and zma-mir156a were detected  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  times respectively . the abundance of zma-mir <dig> was extremely low compared to that of zma-mir <dig> in our dataset, which was consistent with previous finding that these two mirnas are conversely regulated. in comparison to other plant species, tae-mir169b in wheat and osa-mir <dig> in rice are the most frequently sequenced mirnas while mir <dig> in rice and wheat exhibits low abundance  <cit> . this may suggest a species-specific expression profile for mirnas. mir156a was also found to be highly expressed in medicago truncatula  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir156a, located on chromosome  <dig>  targets  <dig> mrnas that code for the squamosa promoter-binding protein  box, which is involved in leaf morphogenesis  <cit> . however, mechanisms causing the differential expression profile of a same mirna in different plant species is unknown. diversity of maize mirnas also could be found in the aspect of the amount of members they contained . the largest mirna family size identified was mir <dig> that consisted of  <dig> members and mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> possessed  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively; whereas other mirna families such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> had only one member detected in this period. the size of mirna families may be indicative of their function. different family members also displayed drastically different expression levels . for example, the abundance of mir <dig> family varied from  <dig> reads  to  <dig>  reads  in the deep sequencing. this was also the case for some other mirna families, such as zma-mir <dig>  and zma-mir <dig> . two members, zma-mir528a and zma-mir528b in zma-mir <dig> family, however, their expression levels were similar and were detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  times, respectively. the existence of a dominant member in a mirna family may suggest that the regulatory role of this family was performed by the dominant member at the developmental time when the samples were collected for rna extraction. abundance comparisons of different members in one mirna family may provide valuable information on the role that mirnas play in that plant specific developmental stage. four known mirna families, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were not successfully detected in our datasets suggesting that mirnas expression maybe developmental and/or tissue-specific. after our dataset was blastn searched against known maize mature mirnas, the same dataset was used to compare with  <dig> known mirnas from other diverse plant species. we found  <dig> additional conserved mirnas that have not been reported in maize . the 'seed' region, located at mirna nucleotides 2- <dig>  is the most important sequence for interaction with mrna targets  <cit> . the seed regions of the newly identified maize mirnas t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> were identical to those of ctr-mir <dig> and ctr-mir <dig>  respectively, indicating that they may share the same targets.

identification of novel maize mirnas
although the characteristic hairpin structure of mirna precursor could be used to predict novel mirna, it is very challenging to define novel mirnas. we developed a prediction software mireap to predict novel mirna by exploring the secondary structure, the dicer cleavage site and the minimum free energy of the unannotated small rna tags which could be mapped to the maize genome. a small rna is considered as a potential mirna candidate only if it meets all of the following strict criterias: 1) the sequence could fold into an appropriate stemloop hairpin secondary structure, 2) the small rna sits in one arm of the hairpin structure, 3) no more than  <dig> mismatches between the predicted mature mirna sequence and its opposite mirna* sequence in the secondary structure, 4) no loop or break in the mirna or mirna* sequences, and 5) predicted secondary structure has higher minimal folding free energy index and negative minimal folding free energy.  <dig> sequences were obtained based on the above criteria. although forming specific hairpin stem loop structures is one of the most important characteristics of pre-mirnas, it is not unique to pre-mirnas; lots of other coding or non-coding rnas, such as rrnas, trnas and mrnas, also have the similar hairpin structures  <cit> . several studies observed that mirna precursors have low folding free energy, and considered that low free energy is one important characteristic of mirnas  <cit> . however, minimal folding free energy depends on the lengths of rnas  <cit>  and the length of mirna precursors significantly varies, for example, the lengths of plant mirna precursors range from  <dig> to more than  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . to avoid the effect of using minimal folding free energy as a criterion to identify genuine mirnas, the length of rnas must be considered. to better distinguish mirnas from other rnas, zhang et al.  <cit>  combined several parameters to form a new criterion called minimal folding free energy index   <cit> . pre-mirnas have high minimal folding free energy index   <cit> . they found that the average mfei of mirna precursors is  <dig>  in previously known plant pre-mirnas, and this value is significantly higher than that for trnas , rrnas , and mrnas . more importantly, more than 90% of mirna precursors have an mfei greater than  <dig> , and no other rnas have mfei higher than  <dig> . this suggests that mfei is useful to distinguish mirnas from other non-coding and coding rnas. their results suggest that rna sequences with mfei larger than  <dig>  are most likely to be mirnas  <cit> . this finding provids a more precision criterion to predict mirnas using computational and/or experimental approaches. out of the  <dig> mirna candidates,  <dig> had mfei greater than  <dig> .

in order to make certain that the  <dig> mirna candidates we identified are true mirnas, we constructed and sequenced a second small rna library from the same tissue. following the same analysis approach as that used for the first library,  <dig> sequences with mfei greater than  <dig>  were identified. by comparing these  <dig> and  <dig> distinct reads, we found that  <dig> of them were identical between the two small rna libraries in terms of their precursor sequences, mature mirna sequences, and their chromosomal locations. further more, no significant differences of their expression profiles existed between the two experiments. we believed that these  <dig> sequences were most likely true novel mirnas. the stringent criteria used to predict novel mirnas could potentially reduce false positive rates at the cost of missing authentic mirnas.

the  <dig> novel mirnas can be classified into  <dig> families  and their pre-mirnas, secondary structures, and chromosomal locations were listed in additional file  <dig>  these novel mirna precursors had negative folding free energies  according to mfold <dig>    <cit> ; this was similar to the computational values of arabidopsis thaliana mirna precursors  and much lower than folding free energies of trna  or rrna   <cit> . previous study indicated that animal mirna precursors typically have 70- <dig> nucleotides, but plant mirna precursors are more diverse in structure and size. they vary in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ; most  of the detected mirnas have 81- <dig> nucleotides. only  <dig> % of plant mirnas are less than  <dig> nucleotides in length, a stark contrast to animal mirnas  <cit> . in our research as shown in figure  <dig>  the foldback precursors of  <dig> novel mirnas were about 67- <dig> nucleotides in length, and about  <dig> % with 81- <dig> nucleotides. the novel pre-mirnas were also evaluated for their a+u content, which ranged from 34% to  <dig> % , in agreement with previous studies. we also looked for sequenced mirna* sequences, only seven complementary sequences were found in our combined data sets . most mirna* shows weak expression  and their expression levels are much lower than their corresponding mirnas, consistent with the idea that mirna* strands are degraded rapidly during the biogenesis of mature mirnas  <cit> . it may also be the fact that the expression levels of the majority of the novel mirnas identified were low .

target prediction of maize mirnas
as dry seeds imbibe water, the resumption of energy metabolism and cellular repair occur. later, events such as the activation of genes encoding enzymes involved starch degradation and protein and dna/rna synthesis play critical roles in the decision as to whether a seed would germinate or not. the shift from the seed development/maturation mode to the germination mode is a critical change in the developmental program of seed. regulation of transcription factors targeted by mirnas is involved at this critical stage in plant development  <cit> . our target prediction criteria and methods were also stringent, but still allowed us to capture most mirna targets that are conserved across several plant species, including arabidopsis  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , mustard  <cit>  and grape  <cit> . the majority of conserved mirna targets are various transcriptional factors including sbp, myb, arf, nam, cbf, tcp and grf that are known to regulate plant development. other conserved mirna targets includes f-box protein , atp sulfurylase , cchc type zinc finger protein , nad-binding protein , and poly polymerase , all of them are known to play roles in the expression control of genes involved in regulation of metabolic processes. in our datasets, mirna <dig> showed the highest abundance followed by mirna <dig> and mirna <dig>  respectively, during the very early stage of seed germination. previous studies indicated that mirna <dig> targets hd-zip transcription factors that are involved in plant leaf morphogenesis. hd-zip proteins also regulates vascular development as well as lateral organ polarity and meristem formation. athb <dig>  a member of the hd-zip family, is predominantly expressed in vascular tissues, suggesting that it may play some roles in plant vascular development  <cit> . overexpression of mir166a results in decreasing athb <dig> mrna levels and causes accelerated vascular cell differentiation from cambial/procambial cells and consequently produces an altered vascular system with expanded xylem tissue and an interfascicular region  <cit> . this regulation mechanism may exist in all vascular plant species  <cit> . mirna <dig> has been shown to be involved in floral development and phase change by targeting members of squamosa promoter binding protein like  plant-specific transcription factors. the spl family has  <dig> members; some  are involved in floral transition and regulating plant flowering  <cit> . recent results indicated that overexpression of mir <dig> affects phase transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, including the quickly initiation of rosette leaves, a severe decrease in apical dominance, and a moderate delay in flowering  <cit> . mirna <dig> targets copper proteins, cupredoxin, multicopper oxidase and laccase genes and thus might play a critical role in regulating physiological processes and stress responses. not only the mirna <dig> and mirna <dig> families were abundant during this stage of seed germination, but also they had more family members than other mirna families, suggesting the importance of these two mirna families at this very early stage of seed germination. in arobidopsis, mirna <dig> has been shown to be involved in the regulation of seed dormancy and germination by targeting myb <dig> and myb <dig>  two positive regulators of aba responses during germination. aba is a key regulator of seed maturation and dormancy  <cit> . many aba signal transduction proteins are involved in seed development and germination  <cit> . the sensitivity of seeds to aba that is vital to the termination of seed maturation program, an essential change to increase the competence of seeds for germination, is regulated by conserved mirna <dig>  since there is no dormancy in maize seed, the abundance of both mirna <dig> and mirna <dig> is extremely low compared to that of mirna <dig> and mirna <dig> families in our datasets. auxin responsive factors  are a class of targets of mirna <dig> families. arfs are important components of auxin signal transduction  <cit> . therefore, there is cross-talk between aba and auxin in imbibed mature seeds. studies has indicated that aba-responsive genes that are typical of seed maturation stages and have aba response elements  in their promoter regions are specifically up-regulated in the mirna-resistant marf <dig> seeds. the down-regulation of a component important for auxin signal transduction by mirna may be a regulatory step to decrease aba sensitivity in mature seeds and to switch to the germination mode. the mechanisms involved in aba-auxin cross-talk during seed germination are unknown.

to better understand the functions of the newly identified novel mirnas in maize, putative targets of the  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted. the target genes for  <dig> novel mirnas were successfully predicted . analysis and annotation of the predicted target genes showed that they were with diverse functions, ranging from genes encoding transcription factors involved in transcription regulation to genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolism, genes regulating transport, genes encoding various kinases, genes regulating oxidative reduction and genes encoding isomarase and helicase . when dry seeds absorb water, many cellular processes resume. isomarase and helicase are important enzymes for dna replication, transcription, translation, recombination, dna repair, ribosome biogenesis. most mirna families have multiple target sites, suggesting that these mirnas are functionally divergent. with  <dig> newly identified mirnas, we failed to discover any targets for them in maize. this could have resulted from incomplete coverage of the mrna in the database. it is likely that a number of mrnas could not be identified because they are poorly expressed or highly unstable, or because their expression is restricted to times and locations such that isolation of sufficient amounts of rna for cloning is impractical or has not been done yet. further analysis for their targets is needed and would help us gain insight into the roles these newly identified mirnas play during maize seed imbibition.

CONCLUSIONS
we had sequenced two independent small rna libraries from maize imbibed seed. our data confirmed the authenticity of  <dig> known mirnas in maize. we found  <dig> mirnas that had not been reported in maize, but had been reported in other plant species. we also found  <dig> novel mirnas that had not been reported elsewhere. putative targets for  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted. dry seeds imbibe water and re-initiate active physiology. an important decision as to whether a seed would germinate or not is made following the reactivation events during imbibition. regulation of genes targeted by mirnas is involved at this critical stage in plant development. identification of novel mirnas resulted in significant enrichment of the repertoire of maize mirnas and provided insights into mirna regulation of genes expressed in imbibed seed.
