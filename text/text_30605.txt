BACKGROUND
vertebrate embryos use a combination of transcription factors to specify position along the anterior-posterior  axis. of particular importance is the pbx -family of tale -class transcription factors, which are required globally to pattern the a-p axis of the developing vertebrate embryo. using mouse knockout and zebrafish knockdown models, researchers have shown that pbx proteins are required to specify cell fate in the midbrain, hindbrain, somites, pancreas, and blood  <cit> . in the hindbrain, trimeric dna-binding complexes of pbx, hox and meinox  proteins specify rhombomere identity. in the midbrain, pbx cooperates biochemically with engrailed  proteins to maintain both midbrain-hindbrain and the diencephalic-mesencephalic boundaries  <cit> .

pbx clearly also plays a role in patterning regions outside of the midbrain and hindbrain. for example, mouse knockouts have demonstrated a critical role for pbx during pancreatic development, in which interactions between pbx and insulin promoter factor  <dig>  are required for transcriptional activity, and subsequent expansion of pancreatic cell lineages  <cit> . pbx also plays a role in the development of blood, as pbx – prep <dig>  complexes are required for the production of normal populations of cd <dig> and cd <dig> t-lymphocytes  <cit> . furthermore, pbx – meis complexes have been implicated in megakaryocyte differentiation in rats, through the ability to initiate transcription from the platelet factor  <dig>  promoter  <cit> . recently, it has been shown during the development of skeletal muscle that pbx is constitutively bound to the myogenin promoter, can bind directly to the bhlh transcription factor myod, and is thus required for the development of muscle cell fates  <cit> . a zebrafish mutant, lazarus , that contains a null mutation in the pbx <dig> gene  <cit> , displays global defects in embryonic patterning including hindbrain, muscle, blood, and midbrain tissues.

the meinox  family of tale-class transcription factors are well characterized as dna-binding cofactors for both pbx and hox proteins  <cit> . zebrafish contain at least six meis genes that are expressed in dynamic and tissue specific manners  <cit> . in addition, zebrafish possess at least two pknox/prep genes that are both widely expressed  <cit> . meis genes are prominently expressed in the developing retina  <cit>  suggesting a role for meis in regulating eye formation or patterning. in zebrafish, overexpression of hoxb <dig> throughout the embryo causes ectopic expression of hindbrain markers exclusively within the retina, demonstrating the existence of retinal specific hoxb <dig> competency factors  <cit> . pbx and meinox proteins function as two of these retinal hoxb2-competency factors, demonstrating that both pbx and meis can function in the retina  <cit> . the idea that meinox proteins play a role in eye formation is supported by studies in drosophila, where the pbx homologue extradenticle  and the meis homologue homothorax  inhibit eye formation  <cit> , and in mice where the pknox <dig> hypomorphic and meis <dig> knockout phenotypes include defects in retinal development.  <cit> 

zebrafish make an excellent model for the study of retinal development. the optic primordium is distinct from surrounding tissues as early as  <dig> hours post fertilization , and by  <dig> hpf, eyecups have developed to include lens tissue and the surrounding neural retina  <cit> . by  <dig> hpf, the first post-mitotic neurons have differentiated  <cit>  and by  <dig> hpf, lamination is evident across the retina. two partially redundant pbx genes, pbx <dig> and pbx <dig>  are expressed during early development when the optic primordium and optic cup are developing. the other zebrafish pbx genes, pbx <dig> and pbx <dig> , are expressed more strongly starting at  <dig> hpf. thus, inhibition of pbx <dig> and pbx <dig> in a homozygotic lazarus   embryo allows for analyses of development in the absence of pbx function, prior to  <dig> hpf . the retina of lazarus  zebrafish embryos is noticeably smaller than wild type embryos, but no analysis of patterning has yet been undertaken. this manuscript provides an analysis of pbx and meis function in the developing zebrafish retina, as well as a role for pbx in patterning the tectum, and includes a microarray screen for pbx dependent transcripts in zebrafish to identify gene regulatory networks downstream of this critical homeodomain protein. we propose a model in which pbx functions to specify regional identity in the developing zebrafish retina via activation of the dorsal/temporal specific growth factor, gdf6a.

RESULTS
retinal laminar structure is normal but retinal ganglion cell axon outgrowth is aberrant in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos
previous studies have demonstrated a clear role for the homeodomain transcription factor pbx in regulating cell fates in the hindbrain and at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. the eyes of lazarus  embryos are distinctly smaller than their wild type counterparts, indicating that pbx is required in this tissue as well  <cit> . as a first step towards dissecting the role of pbx proteins in eye development, we compared eye morphology between wild type and pbx2/ <dig> null  at  <dig> days post-fertilization . the laminar structure of the retina appears relatively normal in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos  and the optic nerve exits the eye in the correct location. all nuclear layers are clearly visible in pbx2/ <dig> null eyes, including the inner most retinal ganglion cell layer, and the outermost nuclear layer containing the photoreceptor cells. the retinal pigmented epithelium  of pbx2/ <dig> null embryos is thickened  in comparison to wild type controls , indicating that pbx has a role in regulating rpe differentiation. there is also a distinct change in layer morphology, at the interface of the rpe and photoreceptor layer. in addition to thickened rpe, pbx2/ <dig> null embryos have a disorganized photoreceptor layer , which likely contributes to the aberrant morphology seen at the interface. these data suggest that while pbx2/ <dig> null eyes are smaller than their wild type counterparts, pbx proteins are not required for establishing the laminar structure of the eye.

in wild type embryos, retinal ganglion cells innervate the optic tectum to form an inverse topographic map of the eye. axons that originate in the temporal retina innervate the anterior tectum , while axons that originate in the nasal retina innervate the posterior tectum . in embryos lacking both pbx <dig> and pbx <dig>  no topographic mapping of the rgc axons is observed at  <dig>  or  <dig>  dpf. in the majority of embryos , the primary axon bundle projects toward the optic tectum, but axons appear stalled before entry to the tectum as no branching or outgrowth is observed . these results suggest that pbx proteins regulate transcriptional pathways that control rgc axonal outgrowth and topographic mapping.

whole embryo microarray analysis of pbx mutants identifies known hindbrain patterning genes
in the presumptive hindbrain, pbx <dig> and pbx <dig> functions are critically required for initiation of early growth regulator 2b , musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family protein b , homeobox b1a , hoxa2b, and hoxb <dig>  to identify pbx-dependent transcripts that might regulate retinotectal patterning, we conducted microarray comparisons between  <dig> hpf control embryos  and pbx2/ <dig> null embryos . each array contained  <dig> cdna probes, including  <dig> controls spots  derived from a normalized mixed stage zebrafish cdna library  <cit> . we identified  <dig> transcripts that were downregulated by at least  <dig> fold and  <dig> transcripts that were downregulated by at least  <dig>  fold. we repeated these analyses using two independent biological replicates at  <dig> hpf, two biological replicates at  <dig> hpf, and using two biological replicates of  <dig> hpf zygotic lzr embryos injected with hoxb1a and hoxb1b morpholinos, as these phenotypically mimic the pbx2/ <dig> null phenotype in the hindbrain  <cit> . overall, we identified  <dig> ests that were downregulated by  <dig>  fold in at least two datasets. student t-tests were conducted on genes of interest based on annotation and known expression patterns. focusing on clones that were affected at  <dig> hours, we generated antisense probes and sequence information for  <dig> est clones. we examined  <dig> of these clones by in situ hybridization, to which  <dig> showed pbx dependence at  <dig> hpf. among these clones, we identified egr2b, hoxb3a, mafb, and engrailed 2b  . each of these clones is expressed in either the midbrain-hindbrain boundary or the hindbrain at  <dig> hpf and were previously shown to be downregulated in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos  <cit> . given this validation, the microarray is clearly capable of identifying bona fide pbx dependent transcripts.

microarray and whole mount in situ analysis demonstrates that pbx proteins regulate gene expression in the developing retina
microarray analysis also uncovered pbx dependent transcripts expressed specifically in regions outside of the hindbrain, notably including genes expressed in the muscle  <cit>  and in the retina and tectum . of the  <dig> ests studied,  <dig> are specifically expressed in the retina, tectum, or both. three genes, aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig> family, member a <dig> , t-box  <dig> , and hmx <dig>  are expressed in the dorsal retina. the transcripts for aldh1a <dig>  and tbx <dig> are expressed in the dorsal/temporal retina at both  <dig> and  <dig> hpf , while hmx <dig> is specific to lens and dorsal retina . to examine retinal patterning in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, we performed in situ hybridization with these three putative pbx dependent genes as well as orthodenticle homolog  <dig> , a marker of retinal pigmented epithelium and the optic tectum at  <dig> hpf  <cit> . three of these genes, aldh1a <dig>  tbx <dig>  and hmx <dig> are strongly downregulated in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos at  <dig> hpf , thus supporting the microarray findings. at  <dig> hpf, the expression of aldh1a <dig> and tbx <dig> is downregulated , while the expression of hmx <dig> is unaffected . although we do not observe any change in the expression of otx <dig> in the tectum of pbx2/ <dig> null embryos at  <dig> hpf, there is a marked expansion of the domain of otx <dig> expression to include the entire eye in these embryos . this demonstrates that pbx proteins may function either directly or indirectly as a key repressor of otx <dig> expression. other genes with known retinal gene expression were assayed but did not show pbx dependence, including efnb2a and epha4b . taken together, these data demonstrate a clear role for pbx proteins in regulating gene expression within the vertebrate retina, especially within the dorsal region.

the role of meis proteins in regulating retinal gene expression
within the hindbrain, pbx cooperates with hox and meis/pknox proteins to drive expression of target genes. although hox genes are not expressed in the retina, meis/pknox genes are expressed strongly in this tissue . furthemore, pknox <dig> hypomorphs and meis <dig> knockout mice have morphological defects in retinal formation  <cit> . as meis <dig>  is specifically expressed in the retina during early eye patterning in zebrafish  <cit> , we utilized a morpholino to knockdown meis <dig>  function. this treatment results in the reduction of aldh1a <dig> expression in the retina and hoxa2b expression in the hindbrain at  <dig> hpf . co-injection of mo-insensitive meis <dig>  mrna is sufficient to restore aldh1a <dig> and hoxa2b expression in meis <dig>  morphants , indicating the specificity of the morpholino phenotype. the reduction of retinal aldh1a <dig> expression in meis <dig>  morphants is very similar to pbx2/ <dig> null embryos and is thus consistent with the idea that meis and pbx proteins cooperate to regulate transcription of this particular gene.

pbx is required for both early and late eye patterning genes
to determine when pbx proteins are first required for eye patterning, we analyzed retinal homeobox  gene expression in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos at early stages of development. the expression of rx genes are limited to the eye fields during early development, and expression is required for proper eye development in zebrafish as over-expression leads to ectopic eye formation  <cit> . rx <dig> is expressed in the optic primordium at the tailbud stage , while both rx <dig> and rx <dig> are expressed after somitogenesis . in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, the expression of rx <dig> appears unaffected during early eye specification, but has failed to be downregualted by  <dig> somites . the expression of rx <dig>  however, is reduced throughout somitogenesis in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos . thus, pbx gene function plays a key role in the specification of early eye tissue.

it is likely that pbx2/ <dig> function is also needed later in eye development as processes such as retinal ganglion cell outgrowth are also affected when pbx function is inhibited. we therefore analyzed the expression of atonal homolog  <dig> , which is expressed in a wave-like fashion  in the inner retina prior to retinal ganglion cell differentiation  <cit> . there is a marked reduction in the expression of atoh <dig> in the dorsal retina at both  <dig> hpf  and  <dig> hpf  , while expression in the rest of the inner retinal tissue remains unaffected. this indicates that a lack of atoh <dig> in the dorsal retina may affect retinal ganglion cell differentiation in this domain, which may contribute to the observed defects in retinal ganglion cell outgrowth.

pbx proteins regulate polarized gene expression in the optic tectum
previous research has demonstrated a role for pbx in patterning both the midbrain-hindbrain and diencephalic-mesencephalic boundaries. consistent with this role, our microarray identified three putative pbx dependent transcripts are expressed within the tectum. these genes, ephrin a <dig> , fatty acid binding protein 7a , n-acetyltransferase  <dig>  were examined by whole mount in situ hybridization to confirm the results of the microarray experiment. efna <dig> is expressed in the diencephalon and tectum . the other two genes, fabp7a and nat <dig>  have significant expression in the retina as well as the tectum . each transcript is downregulated in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos with residual expression of each gene found at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary . this is consistent with previous findings showing that pbx proteins are required for the maintenance of gene expression in the mesencephalon.

as development proceeds, the tectum becomes highly organized and is characterized by the polarization of gene expression. at  <dig> hpf, the expression of otx <dig> and ephrina5a  is strongest at the periphery of the tectum, with the highest expression observed distal to the eye while decreasing proximally . these gradients are disrupted in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, whereby expression of otx <dig> is greatest proximal to the eye , and expression of efnna5a is confined to the posterior tectum . by  <dig> dpf, the optic tectum is smaller and disorganized in lzr-/-, pbx2/ <dig> morphant embryos , as shown by visualization of acetylated tubulin-positive axons. these data clearly indicate a requirement for pbx proteins in patterning the optic tectum.

pbx is critically required for expression of gdf6a, itself a regulator of dorsal retina patterning
gdf6a is a growth factor of the bmp family, whose retinal expression is restricted to the temporal/dorsal domain. knockdown of gdf6a results in smaller eyes, as well as reduced expression of eye markers in the dorsal/temporal retina  <cit> . as such, we analyzed whether pbx and gdf6a function in the same pathway to regulate eye patterning, and further analyzed the expression of eye markers in gdf6a morphants. a knockdown of gdf6a results in the elimination of aldh1a <dig> and tbx <dig> expression , markers of the dorsal/temporal retina. as the expression of genes in the dorsal/temporal retina is similar in gdf6a and pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, we tested whether gdf6a functions in the same genetic pathway as pbx. when pbx2/ <dig> function is eliminated, the expression of gdf6a is strongly reduced , indicating that gdf6a functions genetically downstream of pbx. the expression of pbx <dig> is not affected in gdf6a morphants , further supporting the idea that gdf6a functions genetically downstream of pbx.

discussion
in this paper, we present evidence that pbx2/ <dig> gene function is essential for proper retinal ganglion cell axon pathfinding. this phenotype likely results from aberrant pbx mediated gene transcription in both the eye and tectum of pbx2/ <dig> null embryos. although the eye laminar structure is relatively normal after  <dig> days of development, connections between the rgc axons and the optic tectum are not made. through microarray and in situ analysis, we have identified numerous candidate genes that may contribute to rgc axon guidance phenotype seen in embryos with reduced pbx function. abnormalities in eye patterning begin during early somitogenesis, and persist throughout development. defects in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells may also contribute to this phenotype, as the expression of atoh <dig> is eliminated in the dorsal region of the neural retina in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos. the data presented here builds on current knowledge of pbx proteins in embryonic patterning, and provides a novel role for pbx in patterning the eye and tectum, and subsequently, the regulation of rgc axon outgrowth and pathfinding.

an absence of pbx function results in reduced expression of genes involved in eye patterning. in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, defects are seen in the expression of rx <dig> during early somitogenesis, and at  <dig> somites, rx <dig> expression has not been downregulated as seen in wild type embryos  <cit> . this could lead to defects in retinal ganglion cell and photoreceptor development, as rx <dig> and rx <dig> are also expressed in these subsets of cells later in development. we have identified aldh1a <dig>  hmx <dig>  and tbx <dig> as pbx-dependent transcripts at  <dig> hpf. each of these genes has the potential to play a strong role in regulating retinal patterning. for example, aldh1a <dig>  which is involved in the synthesis of retinoic acid, is likely to affect development of the visual system in zebrafish as retinoic acid is required for development of photoreceptor cells and pigmented epithelium in the developing zebrafish eye  <cit> . by  <dig> dpf, the photoreceptor layer is highly disorganized in fish with reduced pbx gene function, indicating a possible effect of aldh1a <dig> misexpression. moreover, we also observed a downregulation of tbx <dig> via both microarray and in situ analysis, a downstream effector of retinoic acid signaling that is essential for establishment of the dorsoventral boundary of the eye  <cit> .

it has been documented that the homeodomain transcription factor soho <dig> represses the expression of epha <dig> in chicks, and is necessary for eye development. the zebrafish pbx dependent gene hmx <dig> is likely the functional ortholog of chick soho <dig>  since it is expressed in the retina and shares extensive sequence similarity. misexpression of soho <dig> in chicks affects epha <dig> expression  <cit> , and loss of epha <dig> leads to premature arborization by rgc axons that originate in the nasal retina, while those that originate in the posterior retina appear unaffected  <cit> . in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, hmx <dig> is down regulated during early eye patterning, and thus may also play a role in phenotypes observed in eyes with reduced pbx gene function, such as a lack of rgc axon outgrowth.

given the profound changes in gene expression, it is surprising that laminar structure and positioning of the optic nerve is relatively normal without pbx2/ <dig> function. as such, there is no evidence for overt dorsal/ventral patterning defects or improper cell differentiation. we believe a partial answer to this paradox lies in the data from the  <dig> hpf microarray, in which each of these pbx-dependent transcripts has more normal levels of expression . we confirmed these results with in situ analysis, showing that changes in aldh1a <dig> and tbx <dig> expression are more subtle, while the expression of hmx <dig> is near wild-type levels at  <dig> hpf, indicating that pbx2/ <dig> are essential for proper initiation of these transcripts, but that other factors are capable of regulating their transcription in the absence of pbx2/ <dig>  at  <dig> hpf, other pbx genes, including pbx <dig> and pbx <dig> , are expressed in the zebrafish embryo. as such, these pbx proteins or other transcription factors might also regulate eye patterning genes at  <dig> hpf.

although not identified in our microarray screen for pbx dependent transcripts, we analyzed the expression of otx <dig>  which in wild type embryos, is expressed throughout the optic vessicle early in development  <cit> , but is restricted to the rpe between 22– <dig> hpf. otx <dig> is also strongly expressed in the optic tectum, and could therefore be responsible for axon guidance through either eye or tectal patterning. we noticed an expansion of expression to include the entire eye in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos at  <dig> hpf, indicating that these embryos are unable to restrict the expression of otx <dig> as development proceeds. a loss of retinoid signaling in mice leads to reduced expression of tbx <dig> and expanded expression otx <dig> throughout the retina, placing both genes downstream of aldh1a <dig>  <cit> . this provides a possible signaling mechanism for the expansion of otx <dig> in pbx2/ <dig> null zebrafish whereby pbx is required for expression of aldh1a <dig>  which, in turn, is required for the restriction of otx <dig> to the rpe. as restriction of otx <dig> expression is required for specification of the rpe layer, it is logical that pbx2/ <dig> null embryos would have defects in the specification of rpe cells. in both lzr and pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, the rpe is thickened in a subtle, but reproducible manner. thus it is likely that the ectopic expression of otx <dig> in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos leads to the thickening of the rpe, but aberrant expression of other retinal transcripts may also be involved.

many pbx functions, such as hindbrain patterning and blood development, are known to involve meinox binding partners. meinox proteins can stabilize pbx proteins, and are often essential for pbx function through cooperative dna binding.  <cit> . meis <dig> knockout mice and prep/pknox mutants have morphological defects in retinal formation including an inappropriately positioned optic nerve  <cit> . the position of the optic nerve implies that meis <dig> is required for proper dorsal-ventral patterning of the retina, although marker analysis has yet been performed. to create zebrafish with reduced meis <dig>  function, we injected embryos with meis <dig>  translation blocking morpholinos. as with pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, knockdown of meis <dig>  function reduced or eliminated aldh1a <dig> expression. thus, it is likely that pbx2/ <dig> and meis <dig>  act cooperatively to regulate at least some aspects of eye patterning. this is in concert with previously published reports that indicate that both proteins are needed to pattern tissues such as the hindbrain  <cit> .

using our microarray approach, we have also identified reduced tectal expression of fabp7a, nat <dig>  and efna <dig> in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos. interestingly, fabp7a and nat <dig> also show decreased expression in the eye in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, and thus may be important in patterning both structures in a pbx dependent fashion. fabp <dig> has been identified as a downstream target of pbx/meinox signaling in humans, whereby increased expression of pknox <dig>  leads to overexpression of fabp <dig> in fetal trisomy leading to down's syndrome  <cit> .

further in development, the optic tectum becomes highly polarized in wild type embryos, which is required for proper retinal ganglion cell axon outgrowth and mapping. by  <dig> hpf, tectal gradients of otx <dig> and ephrina5a expression have been disrupted in embryos with reduced pbx function, indicating its vital role for patterning this tissue. given these results, it is possible that rgc axon pathfinding defects may result in part from pbx dependent patterning defects in the tectum in concert with pbx patterning defects in the retina. an alternative hypothesis would indicate that forebrain patterning, specifically via sonic hedgehog  signaling could lead to the observed axon outgrowth defect, as shh has been shown to negatively regulate growth cone movement  <cit> . this is not the case in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos as no changes in shh expression, nor two of its downstream target genes titf1a and titf1b, are observed .

it has recently been reported that a knockdown of gdf6a, a growth factor of the bmp family, results in smaller eyes in both zebrafish and frogs  <cit> . furthermore, the expression of marker genes in the dorsal/temporal domain of the retina is dependent on gdf6a function. we have expanded on the marker analysis in gdf6a morphants to include aldh1a <dig> and tbx <dig>  which are both eliminated in gdf6a morphants. moreover, gdf6a expression is strongly reduced in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos, indicating that gdf6a acts genetically downstream of both pbx, and is essential for patterning the dorsal/temporal retina. as similar phenotypes are seen with ectopic expression of fgf3/ <dig> in the temporal retina  <cit> , it is likely that fgfs and gdfs represent opposing signals to pattern the nasal and temporal domains of the retina, respectively. given that our data suggest that pbx proteins are genetically upstream of gdf6a expression in the retina, it appears that pbx may play an important role in regulating the fgf-gdf antagonism that leads to correct retinal patterning.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented support a model where aberrant eye and tectal patterning in pbx2/ <dig> null embryos leads to rgc axon outgrowth errors. eye patterning in the dorsal-temporal domain of the retina involve the function of meis <dig>  and a downstream growth factor, gdf6a.
