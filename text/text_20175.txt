BACKGROUND
with a complex and dynamic structure, hair is generated by hair-producing follicles and has a patterned cycle of growth and remodeling, which consists of growth , regression , and rest  stages. there are many genes involved in mature hair follicle  regulation  <cit> .

one of these genes, hairless , is expressed in skin, specifically in the suprabasal cell layer of the interfollicular epidermis and in the lower portion of the hf epithelium; its expression is dependent on the hair cycle. hr encodes a  <dig> kda protein , which contains a zinc finger domain and is localized in the nucleus  <cit> , and acts as a transcriptional corepressor that regulates transcription through directly binding to the thyroid hormone receptor  <cit> , vitamin d receptor  <cit> , and retinoic acid-like orphan receptor Î±  <cit> .

various hr mutant mice have been studied to understand the function of hr, and most hr mutant mice are created by causing the loss of hr function in their cells, giving them a typical phenotype with a recessive inheritance mode  <cit> . microarray analysis of the skin of hrtm1cct/hrtm1cct mice has revealed that loss of hr function results in specific changes in the expression of epidermal differentiation-associated genes such as keratin <dig>  loricrin, filaggrin, keratinocyte differentiation-associated protein , and calmodulin  <dig>  among other such mouse genes  <cit> . these results suggest that hr also plays a role in keratinocyte terminal differentiation through regulation of gene transcription.

the new hr mutant mouse called 'hairpoor'  that we reported recently has a phenotype that is inherited in an autosomal semidominant manner  <cit> . therefore, the heterozygote shows poor hair distribution, whereas the homozygote displays total alopecia. the hrhp mouse genome harbors a t-to-a substitution at position  <dig> in the noncoding exon  <dig> of hr, and this mutation confers overexpression of hr in the mutant mouse skin  <cit> . this clearly distinguishes hrhp mice from other hr mutant mice with loss of function of hr.

marie unna hereditary hypotrichosis  is an autosomal dominant disorder that displays coarse and twisted hair development in early age in humans and progresses to alopecia as the patients grow older. recently, the genetic cause of muhh was found to be similar to the mutation found in hrhp, namely a mutation in the 5' utr of the hr gene  <cit> . this makes the hrhp mouse one of the valuable animal models for muhh, and studying hrhp mice will facilitate the understanding of muhh pathogenesis. hrn mutant is another model for muhh  <cit> . we recently reported that overexpression of hr is associated with alterations in the morphology and expression of a number of genes in the skin of the hrhp mouse  <cit> . in the present study, we performed microarray analysis and compared hrhp/hrhp skin with that of age-matched wild-type mice to identify the genes whose expression was affected by the overexpression of hr. we catalogued the genes showing differential expression in the mutant skin and found some of them to be tightly regulated by hr, which we confirmed using a reporter expression system.

RESULTS
hr overexpression preceded histological changes in the skin of hrhp/hrhp mice
although we have shown that the overexpression of hr causes a number of morphological alterations in the skin, we know little about the molecular basis of these changes. because the hr protein functions as a transcriptional co-repressor  <cit> , we set out to identify the genes whose expression was specifically affected by hr overexpression using microarray analysis. to investigate the initial events underlying the morphological changes, we determined the time point at which morphological changes and hr expression in the skin of hrhp/hrhp mice first occurred.

the fur of +/+ and hrhp/hrhp mice showed noticeable differences by p <dig>  so we examined the histology of the skin at the earlier time points by hematoxylin and eosin staining. at e <dig>  and p <dig>  we did not find any differences in the skins of +/+ and hrhp/hrhp mice  however we observed that hfs were much shorter and did not grow deep into the subcutis layer in hrhp/hrhp skin than in the +/+ skin at p <dig>  in addition, hair bulbs in the hrhp/hrhp mice displayed short and round shape compared to the extended orval shape of the hair bulbs in the wiltype mice . this observation clearly showed the morphological changes occurred in the mutant skin at p <dig> 

next, we compared hr protein expression in the skin of hrhp/hrhp mice with that of +/+ mice by western blot analysis. the expression of hr was increased in hrhp/hrhp skin compared with +/+ skin at p <dig> and p <dig>  as shown in figure 1h, indicating that hr was overexpressed in hrhp/hrhp skin.

based on these results, we decided to perform microarray analysis on the skin of mice at p <dig> as hr was overexpressed without prominent morphological changes in the skin of hrhp/hrhp compared to that of +/+ mice at this stage.

microarray expression profile of genes differentially expressed in the skin of hrhp/hrhp mice
using  <dig>  mouse probes, we performed microarray analysis and detected differential expression in  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> genes  in the skin of hrhp/hrhp mice compared with the skin of +/+ mice at p <dig> , listed in table  <dig>  among the  <dig> genes with > 2-fold expression,  <dig> were downregulated in hrhp/hrhp skin at p <dig>  the most strongly downregulated genes in the mutant skin included cidea , cyp2g <dig>  and krt <dig> . contrasting this downregulation, the expression of  <dig> genes, sepina3h , hmgcs <dig> , and odc <dig>  in particular, were significantly upregulated despite hr being a transcriptional corepressor.

in addition, we also analyzed microarray data using q-value. we found differential expression of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> genes  in the skin of hrhp/hrhp mice compared with the skin of +/+ mice at p <dig>  fewer genes were found to be differentially expressed based on the q-values than on the p-values. while some of the genes with higher fold change in expression were found to be not differently expressed , many genes such as cidea, cyp2g <dig>  krt <dig> sepina3h, hmgcs <dig> and odc <dig> showed significant differential expression with significant q-values . all of  <dig> genes are listed in additional file  <dig> and  <dig> 

using the database of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ,  <dig> genes , which were identified to be affected by overexpression of hr in hrhp/hrhp mice, were found to be involved in the biological pathways related to cell-cell signaling and communication, various cancers, metabolism, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . these results suggested that pathways involved in the communication and proliferation of cells were affected by hr overexpression.

expression pattern of hf associated genes during hf morphogenesis
as the first step to delineating the function of the genes whose expression was affected by hr overexpression, we assessed genes directly associated with hf development. because few genes were directly associated with hf morphogenesis and/or development in the  <dig>  or  <dig>  genes showing differential expression, we broadened our search to include the  <dig> genes . among those genes, we focused on the wnt signaling pathway-associated genes , caspase- <dig> , janus kinase- <dig> , keratins  and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  . wnt signaling is not only involved in hf development  <cit>  but also in hf cycling  <cit> . hr is reported to play a role in these processes  <cit> . hf undergoes vast apoptosis during catagen; casp <dig>  <cit>  and jak <dig>  <cit>  play a role in apoptosis, and in addition, casp <dig> is directly associated with epidermal cell differentiation  <cit> . krt <dig> and krt <dig> are some of the main constituents of structures that grow from the skin. krt <dig> is expressed in the inner root sheath , specifically in henle's and huxley's layers  <cit> , and krt <dig> is expressed in the basal layer of the outer root sheath  <cit> . fgf <dig> is expressed in dermal papilla, the outer root sheath, and keratinocytes  <cit> .

we validated the microarray analysis data using real-time pcr. this was carried out using gene-specific primers and the same rna sources used for the microarray analysis. results found by real-time pcr corroborated those from the microarray analysis, as shown in table  <dig>  six upregulated genes, wif <dig>  wnt7b, casp <dig>  jak <dig>  krt <dig>  and fgf <dig>  showed similar or higher upregulation by real-time pcr than microarray analysis. two downregulated genes, sfrp <dig> and krt <dig>  showed a similar fold reduction in expression with both measurement techniques.

to analyze the potential role of these genes in hf morphogenesis, we investigated their expression during early hf morphogenesis  by comparing their expression levels in the skin of mutant mice with those of wild-type mice. further real-time pcr analysis revealed that the downregulated genes, krt <dig> and sfrp <dig>  maintained their decreased expression status in the mutant skin throughout the various developmental stages. the relative expression levels of krt <dig> and sfrp <dig> mrna in the mutant skin was decreased to  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold of those in the wild type skin at p <dig>  respectively.

on the other hand, there were two subclasses of the upregulated genes; one group displayed a consistent expression pattern, whereas the other group showed an inconsistent pattern with respect to the hr expression. the relative expression levels of wnt7b, krt <dig>  jak <dig>  and fgf <dig> did not show a consistent pattern with respect to the hr expression in hrhp/hrhp mice. in contrast, the levels of wif <dig> and casp <dig> mrna gradually increased over time. thus, by p <dig>  the relative expression levels of wif <dig> and casp <dig> in hrhp/hrhp skin were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher than those of +/+ skin, respectively. this continuous increase in expression was consistent with the hr overexpression pattern in hrhp/hrhp mice   <cit> .

expression of wif <dig>  casp <dig>  sfrp <dig>  and krt <dig> in keratinocytes
to further analyze whether the expressions of wif <dig>  sfrp <dig>  casp <dig>  and krt <dig> were directly regulated by hr, we investigated changes in expression of these genes in the presence of overexpressed hr in a transient expression system using the mouse keratinocyte cell line, pam <dig>  rt-pcr revealed all the genes normally expressed in pam <dig> cells ; transfection of pam <dig> cells with hr cdna construct resulted in expression of hr . the expression of all four genes was affected by the presence of hr: expression of wif <dig> and casp <dig> was increased  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in hr-overexpressed cells compared to the mock-transfected pam <dig> cells, respectively. in contrast, the relative expression of sfrp <dig> and krt <dig> was decreased to  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold  in hr-expressing cells compared with control cells. these results were consistent with their expression pattern in vivo and strongly suggested that hr may directly regulate expression of these genes.

discussion
recently, we reported the hrhp mouse generated by n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea mutagenesis as an animal model of human muhh  <cit> . as an initial step to delineate the molecular basis of the underlying mechanism for the hrhp phenotype, we investigated the differential expression of genes in the skin immediately before morphological changes occurred in the hrhp/hrhp mouse. microarray analysis revealed that various biological pathways and the expression of many genes were affected by overexpression of hr.

other studies have reported systematic screening of differentially expressed genes in the skin of mice with the hr mutation, including analyses of gene expression in the skin of hrn mice, another hr-overexpressing mutant, and hrtm1cct, an hr-loss-of-function mutant  <cit> . hrn mutants harbor the mutation a402g, which abolishes the same uatg as in hrhp mutants, indicating that they have an identical defect  <cit> . a comparison of our microarray analysis results with those reported for the hrn mutant did not show that the same genes displayed differential expression. this may be due to the difference in the developmental stage of the hf and epidermis  used in these analyses. however, many keratin-associated protein genes were detected in both mutants. at p <dig> in hrhp/hrhp mice, the expression of krtap6- <dig>  krtap16- <dig>  and krtap16- <dig> increased, whereas the expression of krtap5- <dig> and krt <dig> decreased. similarly, krtap6- <dig>  krtap8- <dig>  krtap <dig>  krt1- <dig>  and krt1- <dig> were downregulated in hrn/hrn mice at p <dig>  <cit> . these results suggest that hr-regulated genes are associated with keratinocyte differentiation and/or hair-shaft structure. furthermore, changes in the expression of keratin <dig>  kdap, and many epidermal differentiation-associated genes were also detected in hrtm1cct/hrtm1cct mice at p <dig>  <cit> . results suggest that mutation of hr causes the abnormal expression of many keratin-associated genes during hf morphogenesis and result in disruption of normal hair formation  <cit> .

of four genes with consistent expression patterns with respect to hr overexpression, two genes, sfrp <dig> and wif <dig>  belong to wnt inhibitor families. both inhibitors interfere with wnt signaling transduction by binding directly to the wnt protein  <cit> , but though they function in a similar fashion in the wnt signaling pathway, they displayed completely different expression patterns in hrhp/hrhp skin compared with age-matched +/+ skin. surprisingly, sfrp <dig> was downregulated by overexpression of the hr protein, whereas wif <dig> was upregulated. although we cannot rule out the possibility that this result may be caused by different locations of sfrp <dig> and wif <dig> expression in the skin, this difference is more likely to result from the differential transcriptional regulation of these genes, as seen in keratinocyte cells with hr overexpression . the hr overexpression in keratinocyte cells results in suppression of sfrp <dig> by 39% and activation of wif <dig> by 85%, suggesting that these promoters respond to hr differently. it is not known whether hr functions as an activator for wif <dig> transcription, and further study is required to understand its mechanism of action. regulation of the wnt pathway by hr through transcriptional regulation of wise, soggy and sfrp <dig> is reported to be important for proper hf cycling. while expression of wise and soggy mrnas were upregulated in the hrtm1cct/hrtm1cct skin. their expression levels were reduced in the skin of hr over-expressing transgenic mouse . sfrp <dig> was also shown to be downregulated in the hrhp/hrhp skin.  <cit> . we may include two more wnt inhibitors, sfrp <dig> and wif <dig>  for being regulated by hr based on this work. further study is required to understand their function in hf development and/or cycling.

casp <dig> is another gene upregulated by overexpression of hr, and is expressed in irs and corneous cells of the outer root sheath in hfs  <cit> . it plays a role in the formation of the stratum corneum and terminal differentiation of keratinocytes  <cit> . the higher levels of casp14mrna suggest that an increase in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes occurs in the mutant skin. this result is comparable with our observation that the epidermis of the mutant skin shows increased differentiation in three-week-old mutant mice compared with age-matched wild-type mice  <cit> . interestingly, casp <dig> is also highly expressed in hrtm1cct/hrtm1cct mice, which display the hairless phenotype and show an increase in terminal differentiation of the epidermis with loss of function of hr  <cit> . furthermore its striking up-regualtion is age specific, which closely resembles its expression pattern in the hrhp/hrhp mice. thus, despite having the opposite molecular defect, hrhp/hrhp and hrtm1cct/hrtm1cct mice exhibit increased expression of casp14and displayed a similar increase in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, suggesting that, casp <dig> may play an important role in proper differentiation of ketatinocyte. thus, although it is not clear how hr regulates casp14expression, both loss of hr expression and hr overexpression lead to alopecia through expression of casp <dig> expression. krt <dig> is also expressed in the irs, specifically in henle's and huxley's layers; gene knockout mice show irregularly formed henle's and huxley's layers compared with the wild-type mice, indicating that krt <dig> plays an important role in the formation of linear irs intermediate filaments  <cit> . results show that the downregulation of krt71expression in the skin of hrhp/hrhp mice is comparable with that in krt <dig> knockout mice in that irss in hrhp/hrhp mice were also abnormal.

CONCLUSIONS
wif <dig> and casp <dig> were found to be upregulated, whereas krt <dig> and sfrp <dig> were downregulated by overexpression of hr. these results suggest that hr may transcriptionally regulate these genes. clearly, further studies are required to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying how hr regulates its target genes and to elucidate the role of hr in hf development, leading to a better understanding of muhh.
