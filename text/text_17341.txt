BACKGROUND
the pigmentation of the human skin is the result of a complex process by which the pigmentary biopolymer, melanin, is produced and packed in the melanosome  and is distributed to the surrounding epidermal keratynocytes. based mainly on the study of mouse mutants, a description has been made of over  <dig> loci that are involved in the pigmentary phenotype  <cit> .

although a lot of work has been done on the biochemistry and cytology of pigmentation, the evolutionary genetic history of this phenotypic trait has been less investigated. initially, the observed correlation between ultraviolet radiation  and skin color  <cit> , together with the geographical apportionment of skin reflectance among human populations in the major continental regions  <cit> , suggest that the evolution of human skin pigmentation has been adaptive. early evolutionary studies focused on mc1r diversity  <cit> . although both these works observed a depletion of variability in africans in comparison to europeans and asians, which was explained by purifying selection in africans, the interpretation for the enhanced euro-asiatic diversity was different. thus, while  <cit>  claimed that diversifying selection has been responsible for the high diversity found in eurasians,  <cit>  invoked functional relaxation, and therefore neutral evolution, for this locus outside africa. phylogenetic comparison of mc1r primate sequences by  <cit>  indicated that mc1r has been subject to purifying selection.

other genes have been associated with the pigmentary phenotype, such as the p locus   <cit> , matp   <cit>  or asip  <cit> . more recently, it has been suggested that different genes may be responsible for the light pigmentary phenotypes observed in different non-african populations. accordingly, a derived allele in a snp within slc24a <dig> correlates with lighter skin in europeans, but not with light skin in east asians  <cit> . additional support for this point came from the work by  <cit> , who used public snp databases to single out dct as a pigmentation gene candidate for recent positive selection in the chinese only. in addition,  <cit>  found that while asip and oca <dig> might play a shared role in shaping light and dark pigmentation across the globe, genes like slc24a <dig>  matp and tyr may have had a predominant role in the evolution of light skin in europeans but not in east asians. according to the authors, this provides compelling evidence that light skin has evolved independently in european and east asian populations. other genome-wide scans for genes under recent positive selection from ascertained snps claimed several pigmentation genes  as candidates for adaptive selection in europeans only  <cit> , whereas  <cit>  suggested that protection against the damaging effects of uvr might hold an adaptive value in africans.

however, most of the genetics of pigmentation is based on the mouse as a model organism. in contrast to humans, melanocytes in adult murine skin are generally confined mainly to hair follicles   <cit> . it is therefore likely that some of the pigmentation genetics learnt from mice may not be directly applicable to humans. in this context, we have used affymetrix u133a  <dig>  microarray analysis to investigate the gene expression profiles of different human melanocyte cell lines. this is expected to provide us with a list of loci involved in human skin pigmentation, which can be used as candidate loci for evolutionary inference. taking these results into account, we have resequenced between  <dig> to  <dig> kb of the proximal regulatory regions of three genes of interest, namely, tyr, tyrp <dig> and dct. these genes form a homogeneous unit, as they belong to the same family and coordinate the production of melanin from tyrosine. thus, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis is tyrosinase  , which catalyses the conversion of tyrosine into dopaquinone  <cit> . tyrosinase activity is required for the synthesis of two types of melanins, pheomelanins  or the more photoprotective eumelanins . pheomelanogenesis seems to be the default pathway in the absence of mc1r signaling, with low tyrosinase activity and a high concentration of cysteine. instead, eumelanin synthesis requires α-msh binding to mc1r  <cit> , which transcriptionally activates tyrosinase and upregulates tyrosinase-related protein- <dig>  and dopachrome tautomerase . other genes like asp, the α-msh antagonist, slightly reduce tyrosinase activity and produce an almost complete loss of tyrp <dig> and dct expression, thereby decreasing eumelanin synthesis  <cit> .

we have focused on the proximal regulatory region, as it has been proposed that variation at regulatory regions may account for intraespecific morphological diversity  <cit> . we therefore resequenced  <dig> human chromosomes from diverse geographical origin, including africans, europeans , asians and australian aborigines, in search of diversity patterns that could help us reconstruct the evolutionary history of human skin pigmentation.

RESULTS
microarray experiments
affymetrix u133a v <dig>  microarrays were used to analyze five melanocyte cell lines from lightly pigmented donors and four from darkly pigmented donors, plus their respective unirradiated controls. two additional cell lines from darkly pigmented donors did not yield rna of sufficient quality for reverse transcription.

the first eigenvector for the sam pattern discovery  analysis identified  <dig>  probes as differentially expressed at an fdr of  <dig> % . unexpectedly, expression values did not cluster the cells into unirradiated versus irradiated melanocytes, or into lightly pigmented versus darkly pigmented melanocytes. instead, we observed a differentiation between the m <dig> and m <dig> cells on the one hand , and the rest of the cell lines on the other. one possible explanation points to the different growth media used. however, a precise comparison of the media is difficult because providers do not always disclose the detailed formulation of the commercial media. with the information available, we can speculate on the absence of melanocyte mitogens bpe and/or pma in the m <dig> and m <dig> cell cultures as a possible explanation. both pma and bpe could be boosting proliferation and melanogenesis in the "rest of the cells" group. in fact, both m <dig> and m <dig> proved to be very slow growing. in this regard, bpe usually contains α-msh, which is a strong stimulator of melanogenesis. it has been shown that the induced release of α-msh by uv light-irradiated keratinocytes  stimulates melanogenesis  <cit> . along these lines,  <cit>  reported also that human melanocytes cultured in media containing bpe do not respond to increasing concentrations of α-msh, whereas the removal of bpe resulted in a significant reduction in melanocyte proliferation and melanogenesis, but restored responsiveness to melanotropins. however, for microarray experiments, the difficulty in growing melanocyte cultures without bpe may hamper the obtaining of the high cell numbers required. to confirm the effect of the presence/absence of bpe on the expression profiles of tyr, tyrp <dig> and dct, we quantified by qpcr  the expression levels of these genes in one cell line that was grown in  cascade growth medium  <dig> supplemented with 1% hgms  vs. the same cell line grown in  cascade medium plus promocell supplement . in this case all three genes suffered a reduction in their expression levels when grown under the second conditions / tyr:  <dig>  ±  <dig> , tyrp1:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and dct:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ) . we also investigated the effect of adding a known amount of bpe to the medium and thus we compared the expression levels of these when cell were grown in  promocell growth medium plus promocell supplement vs.  promocell growth medium plus promocell supplement and  <dig> %  of a  <dig> mg/ml solution of bpe. addition of bpe led to an increase of the expression level of all three genes / tyr:  <dig>  ±  <dig> , tyrp1:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and dct:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ) . these results indicate that in melanocytes, bpe has a biological effect on the expression of, at least, tyr, tyrp <dig> and dct.

in any case, the homogeneity found in the gene expression profiles of human melanocytes grown in bse-containing media suggests that melanocytes from both light and dark pigmentation donors may have the same genetic ability to produce melanin if subject to the same level of external  signaling molecules, at least above a certain concentration.

interestingly enough, however, gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between these two groups indicates that the term "melanin biosynthesis from tyrosine" is a significant, non-redundant, "biological process" term . genes belonging to this biological term are overexpressed in the "rest of the cells" group. among the top over-expressed probes we can find those corresponding to mlan-a, tyr, tyrp <dig>  dct, gpr <dig>  s100b, oca <dig>  silv or sox <dig>  and further down the list, mitf, pax <dig>  kit or slc45a <dig> , genes known for their involvement in melanocyte function and development. mc1r is further down the list, but still shows an average log <dig> difference in gene expression of over  <dig> . rather unexpectedly, slc24a <dig>  a gene recently claimed as a major pigmentation gene in humans  <cit> , does not appear in this list. nevertheless, this list provides a good collection of candidate loci for further diversity analysis in human populations from which to obtain evolutionary inferences. non-redundant go terms  over-presented in the m <dig> and m <dig> cells group include: cell-adhesion , cell-cell signaling , inflammatory response , skeletal development , chemotaxis , morphogenesis , sensory perception , organelle organization and biogenesis , rna processing , phosphate transport , cell surface receptor linked signal transduction , humoral defense mechanism  , reproductive organismal physiological process , dna repair , cellular macromolecule metabolism , metal ion transport  and protein metabolism .

based on this information, we decided to resequence the proximal regulatory regions of the melanogenic loci tyr, tyrp <dig> and dct in search of evidence for selection on these genes. it is expected that resequencing, rather than typing previously ascertained snps, will provide unbiased information that will help us to more faithfully reconstruct the evolutionary history of these pigmentation loci.

population diversity and neutrality tests from sequence data
in the approximately  <dig> kb of the tyr upstream genomic region resequenced we have detected  <dig> snps in the global sample of  <dig> chromosomes. we have also detected two polymorphisms derived from runs of ts at chr11: <dig> and chr11: <dig>  one ga microsatellite between chr11: <dig> , one polymorphic alu insertion at chr11: <dig>  which seems to belong to the ya <dig> family, and three polymorphic indels, one of them involving  <dig> bp and two involving  <dig> bp. none of these non-snp polymorphisms was considered for the diversity analysis, partly because of their different mutational nature to snps and partly because of the intrinsic difficulty in sequencing through some of these regions. out of the above  <dig> snps, one falls within a putative caat box located about  <dig> bp upstream the translation initiation codon. none of them falls within other known cis-regulatory regions  <cit> . these polymorphisms assemble into  <dig> different haplotypes, whose genealogical relationships are shown in figure  <dig> 

in the approximately  <dig> kb of the tyrp <dig> upstream genomic region resequenced we have detected  <dig> snps. polymorphisms derived from a run of ts at chr9: <dig> and from a run of as at chr9: <dig> as well as a polymorphic rearrangement involving a  <dig> bp insertion found at chr9: <dig>  were not considered in the analysis for the same reasons as above. none of the  <dig> snps fell within known cis-regulatory regions  <cit> . these polymorphisms assemble into  <dig> different haplotypes, whose genealogical relationships are shown in figure  <dig>  haplotype frequencies and genotypes are available as supplementary material 

for the  <dig>  kb region upstream from dct, we have detected a total of  <dig> snps plus one indel , which was not considered for the sequence analysis for the same reasons as above. none of the snps falls within the known cis-regulatory regions located in the approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription initiation point  <cit> . these polymorphisms assemble into  <dig> different haplotypes, whose genealogical relationships are shown in figure  <dig> 

detected snps and indels have been submitted to dbsnp and will be publicly available in build  <dig> .

after removing polymorphic positions, we estimated the divergence between a chimp sequence and the human sequence. the estimated divergence for dct was  <dig>  ;  <dig>   for tyrp <dig> and  <dig>   for tyr. these values fall within normal average neutral values  <cit>  and suggest that no substantial evolutionary acceleration has occurred in these genomic regions since the human-chimp split.

diversity measures for all samples are summarized in table  <dig>  overall, both dct and tyrp <dig> show higher haplotype diversity in the african populations analyzed, whereas tyr shows similar levels of haplotype diversity across populations.

among the non-african populations, the chinese sample shows a substantial drop in diversity for both dct and tyrp <dig>  this drop in diversity is accompanied by significantly negative tajima's d values for both dct and tyrp <dig>  although these values become non-significant after multiple-test correction . dhew and hew tests are also significant for dct in the chinese  . these results suggest possible positive selection acting on alleles of these loci in the chinese, in particular for dct.

the european samples, however, show positive  tajima's d values for dct and tyrp <dig>  excluding population structure, which is unlikely to be substantial in our european sample, positive tajima's d values can be obtained when some kind of diversity-increasing selection is operating  <cit> . analysis of the hapmap data confirms the existence of snps  with higher than expected heterozygosity  in the extended dct region in caucasians. this observation is compatible with selection by overdominance. europeans and european melanoma patients show some evidence for selection at tyrp <dig> , but this is not significant after multiple-test correction. caucasians share their major tyrp <dig> haplotypes, au1a and au3b, with australian aborigines. the au1a allele seems to pre-date the out-of-africa expansion, since all african and non-african populations analyzed also share this haplotype. this suggests that this haplotype has little to do with pigmentation differences across populations. as regards au3b, the recent claim that aboriginal australians descend from the same african emigrant group as all other eurasians  <cit>  suggests an age for this shared allele of at least  <dig> – <dig>  years. thus, despite the relatively high frequency of au3b in europeans, given the pigmentary differences between australian aborigines and europeans and the lack of strong evidence for selection in them, it seems unlikely that this haplotype is associated with a light skin phenotype, at least in a simple way. in europeans, only tyr shows some evidence for selection but only for the hew test . this is most likely due to the fact that hew is more powerful than dhew in detecting ongoing or recently completed selective sweeps  <cit> . the contrasting patterns between tajima's d and hew in tyr might indicate a partial sweep at this locus in the european  sample. this signature is not observed however in the sample of european melanoma patients. interestingly, european melanoma patients show a frequency for au4b that is markedly lower than that for healthy europeans . however, this observation should be considered only as exploratory, as it is not our purpose in this work to conduct a formal test of association to melanoma.

for the african populations analyzed , the networks observed in figure  <dig> suggest that the main factor responsible for the lack of strong negative tajima's d values in the pygmy sample is population structure. in fact, our pygmy sample is composed of both biaka and mbuti pygmies, who have been described as "substantially different genetically"  <cit> . this observation can explain the positive tajima's d values found for the pygmy sample  <cit> .

in contrast, the senegalese record a highly significant negative tajima's d value for tyrp <dig> , which is suggestive of selection. the observation that neither dhew nor hew are significant for the african populations  is however consistent, as dhew and hew are expected to have much less power than tajima's d to detect selection after fixation of the advantageous allele when ρ is no greater than θ  <cit> , which is the case for the senegalese tyrp <dig> diversity. it may be argued that the simulation parameters inferred from the yoruba are not applicable to other african populations. in an attempt to offset the effects of a possible population expansion on tajima's d p-value observed for the senegalese, and in the absence of a precise demographic model for this population, we have run further simulations assuming for the senegalese the demographic model used previously for the europeans. this is expected to provide a reasonably conservative correction. under this demographic scenario, the p-value for tajima's d in the senegalese is approximately  <dig> . thus, we are inclined to believe that the negative tajima's d in the case of the senegalese tyrp <dig> diversity reflects the signature of an old selective process.

lastly, the lack of signal in australian aborigines can be explained by the effect of drift: if the population that left africa and colonized australia was relatively small and relatively constant, whereby the effect of drift overcame the effect of selective pressure, then this signal of selection may have been lost.

other selection tests based on the hapmap project data
in order to detect selection in more recent evolutionary time windows  <cit> , we have used the snp frequency information available in the hapmap dataset to perform, firstly, a scan for snps with significant pairwise fst values across these loci, and secondly, a search for longer than expected haplotypes within populations by means of the ehh test  <cit>  .

fst comparison is useful for detecting selection in a time window of less than  <dig>  to  <dig>  years  <cit> . after multiple-test correction, several snps were found to be positive across dct and tyrp <dig>  for the hapmap chinese+japanese vs. hapmap caucasians pairwise comparison . overall, our results agree with those by  <cit> , although in our case, multiple-test correction makes non-significant additional pairwise comparisons that  <cit>  found significant for their uncorrected fst tests.

a multiple-test corrected significant fst values at an fdr of 5% . a total of  <dig> snps were analyzed.

d population in which the core haplotype shows longer than expected ehh at a significance value of  <dig>  .

using a different long-range haplotype statistic for dct,  <cit>  suggested the existence of a core snp at rs <dig> whose bidirectional breakdown of haplotype homozygosity of the derived allele "a" evidenced selection. our ehh approach , however, did not identify this snp as a strong candidate core, perhaps because our procedure to declare significance  is more stringent than that used by  <cit> . instead, our dct core haplotype "tca", which is located around  <dig> kb upstream from rs <dig>  overlapping an intronic conserved region in mammals, actually identifies a subset of the rs <dig> "a" haplogroup.

the core snps for tyrp <dig> hapmap yoruba fall within a conserved region  that contains at least one potential transcription factor binding site for sox <dig>  and is placed less than  <dig> kb upstream of a putative tyrp <dig> enhancer sequence  <cit> .

the relatively low frequencies of dct core haplotype "tca" in the chinese+japanese and of tyrp <dig> core haplotype "tga" in the yoruba  suggest that we are detecting the signature of selection in young haplogroups only. ehh is expected to fail to detect the signature of selection in older haplotypes because of the decay of ld with time. however, at least in the case of tyrp <dig>  the fact that both tajima's d and ehh detect selection may indicate that the environmental pressure was probably old, and either continued to act for some time after the origin of this "tga" allele and then ceased or is still ongoing.

finally, the core snps for tyrp <dig> in the hapmap chinese+japanese fall astride a ltr  and a line  element, around  <dig> kb upstream from the aforementioned core snps for tyrp <dig> in the hapmap yoruba. complete homozygosity for a core haplogroup "aa" extends well into the 5'-flanking region of the gene, and seems to constitute a major subset of allele au1a. its high frequency  and long ehh correlates with the  signal of selection detected by tajima's d in the chinese tyrp <dig> sequence diversity.

the proximity of the two core haplotypes for tyrp <dig> observed in two different populations, in combination with the long ehh that extends into the flanking region of the locus, and the evidence for selection on these two populations from the tajima's d test, point to a region distally upstream of tyrp <dig> as the target region for selection on tyrp <dig> diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
it is well-established that dark skin is photoprotective , but whether this photoprotective role represents an evolutionary advantage is less clear. alternative mechanisms to explain a possible adaptive advantage of dark pigmentation involve concealment  <cit>  or the protection of folate from uvr-induced photolysis  <cit> . however, in the light of the apparent vagaries that occur in the pigmentation of mammalian skin, including primates, others  <cit>  suggest that dark skin may have outlived its usefulness. selective mechanisms for light skin involve the facilitation of vitamin d <dig> synthesis  <cit> .

the ability to detect selection from diversity patterns depends on many aspects, such as the demography of the population under study, the mutation and recombination rates of the locus, the dominance and selection coefficients of the advantageous allele, whether the advantageous allele has reached fixation  or not, and whether the favorable allele arose from a single mutation at the time of the selective pressure or was favored from standing variation  <cit> . thus, we have used a battery of different tests to enhance the ability to detect selection, and we have been able to show the signature of directional selection particularly on tyrp <dig> in africans, and on dct and tyrp <dig> in asians. we should bear in mind that the constitutive pigmentation of the skin is not exclusively dependent on melanin production. other factors, such as the distribution of melanins within melanosomes, the melanosome secretion rate by melanocytes, the rate of melanosome ingestion by keratynocytes and the distribution of melanosomes within keratynocytes, are also major determinants of skin pigmentation . the question of how these mechanisms can be functionally linked to the observed diversity patterns in the melanogenic loci studiedcannot be answered with the present data. however, the observed patterns of diversity do seem to support the idea that selection has had a role in the evolutionary history of melanogenesis.

as regards the nature of selection, the resequencing analysis did not detect any polymorphism in the known proximal regulatory-elements that could be associated with pigmentary differences. however, judging by the localization of the core snps identified by the ehh tests it seems likely that, at least in the case of tyrp <dig>  distal regulatory regions  are the targets of selection. selection at the level of gene expression for tyrp <dig> would be compatible with the observation that the most darkly pigmented individuals seem to have more tyrp <dig> protein per melanocyte, which has been claimed to be at least partly responsible for the greater tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis reported for dark skin  <cit> . in addition, it seems likely that non-directional selection is acting too. for instance, overdominance seems compatible with the diversity patterns observed for dct in europeans. similarly, the high frequency of the ancestral tyr haplotype within the senegalese suggests that purifying selection at this locus may have been of some importance within africa, although the large number of tyr mutations associated with oculocutaneous albinism  <dig>   suggest that tyr may be a gene under purifying selection in all populations. interestingly, stokowski et al.  <cit> , by means of a multistage genomewide association study, have recently found that polymorphisms in tyr  show significant associations with skin-reflectance measurements in a south asian population. whether this is a particular characteristic of this population remains to be explored, but altogether, this suggests that a number of different selective regimes may have interacted in a complex way in the evolution of melanogenesis. as a result, the lighter skin pigmentation phenotype in europeans and east asians may have been acquired by alternative mechanisms and thus, as previously suggested  <cit> , light skin would be the result of convergent evolution. similarly, the diversity profile of australian aborigines suggests that this may also be the case for dark skin.
