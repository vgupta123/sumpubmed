BACKGROUND
plants respond to abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, and salinity by activation of complex intracellular signaling cascades that regulate biochemical and physiological acclimation. in eukaryotes, protein kinases are key elements involved in signal transduction responsive to metabolism, biotic and abiotic stresses inclusive the major environmental factor salinity. growth of yeast mutants deficient in the sucrose non-fermenting  <dig>  serine-threonine protein kinase that is related to the mammalian amp-activated protein kinase was severely inhibited by nacl indicating a main function of the kinase in regulating adaptative mechanisms to salt stress  <cit> . in plants, a salt-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase  has been, for example, identified from alfalfa with simk that is activated by the mapk kinase simkk, and involvement of mapks in osmotic stress signaling has been shown in tobacco and a. thaliana  <cit> . stress-inducible members within the plant family of serine-threonine protein kinases have been identified within the calcium-dependent protein kinases , the cdpk-related kinases , the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases , and the snrks that are related to snf <dig> from yeast. members of the snrk <dig> subgroup function in regulation of metabolism under environmental stress and have a role in plant development  <cit> . protein kinases of the snrk <dig> and snrk <dig> type are specific for plants and implication in aba signaling was shown for several members of these groups  <cit> . a. thaliana snrk <dig> kinases function in sugar and aba signaling and in salt stress responses  <cit> . snrk <dig> sos <dig> interacts with the ca2+ sensor sos <dig> and the plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter sos <dig> involved in regulation of intracellular na+ homeostasis is activated via the sos pathway  <cit> .

important knowledge on stress-inducible signaling pathways has been mainly derived from studies on the stress-sensitive model plants a. thaliana and rice whereas regulatory signaling elements have been rarely identified in naturally stress tolerant species.

the experiments of this study characterize the protein kinase sapk <dig> that was identified in a screen for genes regulated by salt stress in the facultative halotolerant grass festuca rubra ssp. litoralis . expressional analyses in the salt-sensitive rice line ir <dig> showed down-regulation of the sapk <dig> transcript amounts. over-expression of the rice sapk <dig> in rice conferred increased tolerance to salt stress at the seedling stage and in mature plants. in the transgenic rice, na+ and cl- accumulation was reduced indicating involvement of sapk <dig> in regulation of ion homeostasis. the results presented in this study indicate that sapk <dig> is a determinant of plant salt stress acclimation. identification of signaling transduction elements that have a role in stress adaptation in naturally stress tolerant plants presents a powerful tool to identify transcriptional regulators of adaptive mechanisms to environmental changes that have the potential to improve tolerance in crop plants.

RESULTS
differences of salt-dependent expression of sapk <dig> in rice and in f. rubra ssp. litoralis
the study started from a comparative analysis of salt stress-induced transcriptional responses in the salt-sensitive rice variety oryza sativa  line ir <dig> and in the salt tolerant grass f. rubra ssp. litoralis. genes were identified that differentially respond to salinity in both species. f. rubra ssp. litoralis is characterized by substantial salt resistance, tolerates up to  <dig> mm nacl and continues growth and development with  <dig> mm nacl in hydroponic culture . in contrast, the rice line ir <dig> is severely damaged by exposure to salt concentrations of  <dig> mm nacl  <cit> . the serine-threonine protein kinase sapk <dig> was identified in a subtracted cdna library from f. rubra ssp. litoralis enriched for salt-responsive genes. this experimental approach allowed to identify an est-sequence from f. rubra ssp. litoralis that shared  <dig> and 93% identity on the nucleic acid and amino acid level with sapk <dig> from rice . the present study aimed at a detailed analysis of the role of the kinase in plant salt acclimation. by semiquantitative rt-pcr  and northern-type rna hybridizations , expression of sapk <dig> was detected in non-stressed control plants of f. rubra and rice. in f. rubra, salt stress of  <dig> mm reduced and of  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nacl increased the transcript level of sapk <dig>  in the salt-sensitive rice line ir <dig>  treatment with  <dig> mm nacl for up to  <dig> h caused a decrease of sapk <dig> transcript abundance. due to lethality,  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nacl were not applied to rice.

for an analysis of the subcellular localization of the sapk <dig> protein, constructs for the expression of the sapk <dig> open reading frame cdna fused to the green fluorescent protein  reporter gene driven by the 35s-camv promoter were generated. onion epidermis cells were transformed with the translational fusion and fluorescence emission of gfp was monitored under a confocal laser scanning microscope . in cells incubated for  <dig> hours in  <dig>  Ã— ms nutrient medium, strong gfp signals were detected in the nucleus . cells bombarded with the empty vector as a negative control showed no fluorescence  as a positive control, onion epidermal cells were transformed with a translational construct of gfp. in this experiment, gfp showed localization throughout the cell with strongest signals in cytoplasm and nucleus . to extent the results obtained from the onion epidermal cells system, a. thaliana mesophyll protoplasts were isolated and were similarly transformed with the sapk4-gfp transcriptional constructs. after incubation of transformed protoplasts for  <dig> hours, gfp-derived fluorescence emission was also detected in the cytoplasmic compartment .

over-expression of sapk <dig> in transgenic rice plants
to generate transgenic rice plants, the salt-sensitive variety ir <dig> was transformed with vectors containing the open reading frame rice sapk <dig> cdna for transcriptional over-expression under control of the 35s-camv promoter. three independent transgenic rice lines designated s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> were identified by kanamycin resistance and by the presence of the kanamycin resistance gene. plants of the t <dig> generations were used for further investigations to examine the role of sapk <dig> in plant salt tolerance. in non-stressed plants, a moderate increase in the transcript level of sapk <dig> could be detected in the transgenic lines compared to wild-type rice indicating tight regulation of sapk <dig> mrna in rice . no significant difference between wild-type and transgenic lines was seen in the phenotypes, growth rate, and development up to the age of  <dig> weeks . transgenic plants exposed to elevated nacl concentrations accumulated more sapk <dig> transcript compared with wild-type rice  and the lines were analyzed for their salt stress responses. in two independent rice lines that were transformed with the empty plant expression vector the transcript amounts of sapk <dig> were not changed in comparison to non-transformed wild-type rice  and the phenotype of these plants was not changed as well . these data demonstrate that the observed effects of sapk <dig> over-expression in transgenic rice are a result of sapk <dig> and not of the empty plant expression vector.

sapk <dig> is involved in tolerance to salt stress in rice
wild-type rice and the transgenic lines were grown in hydroponic culture to the age of  <dig> weeks under control conditions and subsequently were exposed to  <dig> mm nacl. at  <dig> days of salt treatment the transgenic lines displayed improved salt tolerance . salt-treated wild-type rice showed growth inhibition and developed chlorosis and necrosis . in contrast, growth of the transgenic lines was rather unaffected and chlorosis was not apparent . to test developmental dependence of enhanced tolerance to increased nacl concentrations by sapk <dig>  germination assays were performed with wild-type rice and t <dig> s <dig> and s <dig> seedlings. control and transgenic plants were germinated on control nutrition medium and on medium supplemented with nacl. results showed that the germination decreased by approximately 20% in wild-type rice by salt treatment whereas germination was not significantly affected in the transgenic lines . in addition, leaf growth was inhibited by the salt stress in wild-type control plants whereas in the transgenic lines the leaf size of seedlings was not significantly changed compared with non-stressed control seedlings .

sapk <dig> regulates ion accumulation in salt-stressed rice
accumulation of cl- was examined in wild-type rice and in the transgenic lines to test whether sapk <dig> affects accumulation of cl- under salt stress. rice plants were grown to the age of  <dig> weeks and treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> hours. under these stress conditions, the lines s <dig> and s <dig> contained only 60% of the cl- contents of wild-type rice . cation homeostasis was addressed by comparing the contents of na+, k+, and ca2+ in wild-type rice and plants of the line s <dig> that were exposed to the same stress regime as described above. the line s <dig> accumulated 60% of na+ and 80% k+ in comparison to wild-type plants whereas no differences in ca2+ accumulation were observed . as a physiological reference chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics were measured and photosynthetic yield calculated. exposure to  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> hours resulted in a decreased photosynthetic activity in wild-type rice whereas no significant change occurred in the lines s <dig> and s <dig> in comparison with non-stressed control plants of the same lines .

the vacuolar atpase, the vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter nhx <dig>  voltage-gated cl- channels, and catalase are well established targets of salt-dependent regulation  and it appeared interesting to study their transcription in wild-type and transgenic rice under salt stress to identify putative target genes regulated by sapk <dig>  the expression levels of the vacuolar atpase, the vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter osnhx <dig>  the cl- channel osclc <dig>  and catalase isozyme a were assessed in wild-type and transgenic rice. the transcript amounts of the v-atpase subunit b and of the catalase increased by treatment with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> hours, whereas the transcript amounts of osnhx <dig> and osclc <dig> decreased in response to nacl stress . in addition, we were interested in analyzing transcription of the plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter sos <dig> but were not able to detect its expression in both wild-type and transgenic rice.

discussion
environmental stresses as drought, cold, and salinity limit the agricultural yield of rice that is one of the most important crops. experimental approaches such as forward and reverse genetics and transcriptome analyses have been chosen to identify molecular key factors that regulate acclimation of rice to environmental changes. over-expression of the rice transcription factor osdreb1a in a. thaliana induced expression of stress-inducible genes and higher tolerance to drought, high-salt, and freezing stresses  <cit> . increased salt tolerance of rice was achieved, for example, by transgenic expression of trehalose biosynthetic genes, a na+/h+ antiporter, an aquaporin, the ca2+-dependent protein kinase oscdpk <dig>  and the mitogen-activated protein kinase osmapk <dig>  <cit> . a comparison of high-yielding but stress-sensitive rice cultivars with rice varieties with increased stress tolerance indicates that salt-sensitive rice varieties are hampered by delayed stress-induced transcriptional response  <cit> .

in the present study a subtractive cdna library of the halotolerant grass f. rubra ssp. litoralis was screened for transcripts that might be regulated differently by salt stress in f. rubra ssp. litoralis and the salt-sensitive rice line ir <dig>  the identified protein kinase sapk <dig> belongs to the rice snrk <dig>  family and demonstrated that the kinase mediates salt stress signaling in rice. constitutive over-expression of rice sapk <dig> conferred increased salt tolerance to rice by interfering with ion homeostasis, maintaining unperturbed photosynthesis and inducing an oxidative stress response. our results demonstrate that the salt-sensitive crop species rice and the related halotolerant grass f. rubra ssp. litoralis differ from each other in the salt-dependent regulation of sapk <dig> that apparently plays a role in salt stress signaling. improved activation of molecular mechanisms of salt adaptation may be seen in transgenic rice plants over-expressing sapk <dig>  thus, our results contribute to the understanding of signaling factors that regulate plant salt acclimation. in addition, characterization of sapk <dig> and identification of target genes that are regulated either directly or by secondary effects by the kinase extends our knowledge on the function of the rice snrk <dig> kinase.

the plant snf1-related kinases  that share homology with the yeast snf1-type kinases have been divided in the three subgroups snrk <dig>  snrk <dig>  and snrk <dig> based on domain structure  <cit> . snrk1-type proteins have been reported to function in plant development and carbon metabolism such as pollen development in wheat and regulation of enzymes such as an alpha-amylase in wheat embryos and adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase in potato tubers  <cit> . the wheat snrk2-subgroup protein pkaba <dig> is up-regulated by dehydration, cold, and osmotic stress, and involvement in abscisic acid and gibberellin signaling has been shown for the barley homologue  <cit> . kobayashi et al.  <cit>  analyzed the transcription of sapk <dig> in leaf blades, sheaths, and roots of 30-days-old rice under control conditions, aba, nacl, and mannitol treatment and found increased transcription in roots and blades by treatment with aba and nacl. in this work the authors found regulation of snrk <dig> family members by phosphorylation  <cit> . in other studies, in the rice genome  <dig> snrk2s could be identified that were activated by hyperosmotic stress, and  <dig> of the proteins responded to abscisic acid whereas in a. thaliana  <dig> of  <dig> snrk2s were regulated by hyperosmolarity but not cold indicating function of the kinases in osmotic stress signaling  <cit> . over-expression of snrk <dig>  improves drought tolerance in a. thaliana but did not regulate stomatal movement whereas snrk <dig>  affects aba-induced stomatal closure  <cit> . members of the a. thaliana snrk <dig> group interact with calcium-binding proteins and have a role in sugar and abscisic acid signaling and in salt stress responses  <cit> .

for a more detailed characterization of rice sapk <dig> the subcellular partitioning of sapk <dig> proteins was addressed by localization of gfp fusions and it was found that the protein kinase was distributed in nucleus and cytoplasm. in yeast it has been shown that the beta subunits of the snf <dig> kinase regulate its subcellular localization to the nucleus, vacuole, and cytoplasm  <cit> . using gfp protein fusions it was shown that snf <dig> kinase beta subunits direct the kinase to the nucleus in a glucose-regulated manner  <cit> . direct regulatory interaction between signal transduction pathways mediated by the yeast snf <dig> kinase and rna polymerase ii holoenzyme has been suggested to activate transcription of glucose-responsive genes  <cit> . accordingly, subcellular localization of rice sapk <dig> in both cytoplasm and nucleus may indicate similar regulatory mechanisms of transcriptional control by the kinase in plant cells.

we generated transgenic rice lines over-expressing sapk <dig>  we found an increased transcript level of sapk <dig> in comparison to wild-type rice under non-stress control conditions that was, however, more pronounced under salt treatment. a similar effect has been described for other transcripts as well. shi et al.  <cit>  reported no increased transcript level of the plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter sos <dig> in sos1-overexpressing a. thaliana when overexpression was driven by the camv-35s promoter. the transcript level increased under treatment with nacl suggesting postranscriptional regulation of sos <dig>  the authors suggested that the sos <dig> transcript might be unstable in the absence of salt stress and that salt stress causes a stabilization of the sos <dig> transcript.

over-expression of sapk <dig> in transgenic rice plants improved germination, growth and development at both the seedling and the mature plant stage in the presence of increased nacl concentrations whereas wild-type rice showed severe developmental and physiological inhibition under the same conditions. the sapk <dig> over-expressing plants accumulated less na+ and cl- than salt-stressed wild-type rice in response to salt stress. the k+/na+ ratio was increased in the sapk4-sense plants. in parallel photosynthesis was not impaired in the salt-stressed transgenic rice. identification of target genes indicates that sapk <dig> regulates the expression of genes that are known to contribute to ion homeostasis and oxidative stress responses: the vacuolar h+-atpase, the na+/h+-antiporter nhx <dig>  the cl-channel osclc <dig>  and a catalase.

the vacuolar h+-atpase mediates electrogenic translocation of protons at endo-membrane compartments of plant cells and energizes processes as cell expansion, secondary activated transport, and adaptation to environmental stress such as salt-induced secondary activated na+ transport via nhx-type na+/h+ antiporters at the tonoplast  <cit> . stimulated transcription, translation, and enzyme activity, respectively, is known from halophytes as mesembryanthemum crystallinum and suaeda salsa and, for example, from the v-atpase subunit a but not subunit d from a. thaliana  <cit> . over-expression of the vacuolar nhx1-type na+/h+ transporter that mediates vacuolar na+ sequestration improved salt tolerance in tomato and rice  <cit> . sapk <dig> over-expressing rice plants, however, revealed reduced transcript amounts of osnhx <dig> and a decreased na+ accumulation indicating that the improved tolerance to salt was caused by cellular na+ exclusion rather than vacuolar sequestration of the ion. for example, suppression of the na+/k+ co-transporter hkt <dig> reduced na+ accumulation in wheat roots and resulted in increased salt tolerance  <cit> , and reduced accumulation of na+ was induced in a. thaliana by over-expressing the na+/h+ antiporter sos <dig> that mediates cellular extrusion of na+ at the plasma membrane  <cit> . voltage-dependent cl- channels of the clc-family function in regulation of membrane potential and cellular ph homeostasis, and involvement of plant clc-type chloride channels in regulation of stomatal movement has been suggested  <cit> . in rice, expression of the clc-type channel osclc <dig> was analyzed showing salt-dependent transcriptional regulation  <cit> . in the present work transgenic over-expression of sapk <dig> in rice repressed both accumulation of cl- and transcription of osclc <dig> indicating involvement of the kinase in regulation of anion homeostasis in salt-treated rice. a role of down-regulation of cl- channels as osclc <dig> in the maintenance of turgor and of the intracellular osmotic potential by restricting cl- fluxes across the plasma membrane has been hypothesized  <cit> .

in addition to hyperosmotic and hyperionic effects of high salinity, salt-stressed plants are also affected by secondary stresses as excessive generation of reactive oxygen species . ros formation is caused by water deficits in salt treated plants that lead to reduced co <dig> fixation and reduced regeneration of nadp+ in the calvin cycle  <cit> . reactive oxygen species are scavenged by antioxidant metabolites as ascorbate, glutathione, and tocopherols and by detoxifying enzymes as superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase  <cit> . for example, over-expression of glutathione s-transferase and glutathione peroxidase increased growth of transgenic tobacco exposed to salt stress, and transgenic tobacco with reduced catalase activity showed increased susceptibility to salt  <cit> . in this study over-expression of sapk <dig> was shown to affect expression of a catalase in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
in future investigations it will be interesting to determine the detailed function of this enzyme in the salt acclimation in rice to further advance the understanding of adaptive cellular mechanisms in salt-stressed plants.

summarizing, the results presented in this study demonstrate that sapk <dig> acts as a regulator of salt acclimation in rice that controls ionic homeostasis and photosynthetic activity and allows continued growth and development in the presence of increased salinity . the experimental data summarized in the model shown in fig.  <dig> are derived from the results of sapk <dig> over-expression in rice under control of the camv 35s promoter performed in the present study. future experiments using for example sapk <dig> t-dna insertion mutants will help to further clarify the functional role of sapk <dig> in plant salt adaptation. identification of salt-inducible signal transduction elements in halotolerant plants and transgenic expression in salt sensitive species as it was performed in this study may be a promising approach to engineer increased resistance to salt stress in crop species.
