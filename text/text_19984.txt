BACKGROUND
molecular networks such as protein interaction, transcriptional or metabolic networks are widely seen as integrative and coherent descriptions for the whole complement of molecular processes inside a cell  <cit> . there has been considerable interest in their structure, their functional organization and their evolutionary properties. for important model organisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster there are now extensive protein interaction data deposited in public-domain databases and serious attempts are being made at elucidating the human protein interaction network   <cit> . these network data sets – extensive though they are thanks to experimental advances and in silico prediction – do not cover the entire network. in particular they do not include all the proteins in these organisms and represent samples only from much larger networks.

but a network introduces a set of relationships and potential dependencies between the constituent nodes and these may be broken up in the subnet. by subnet we mean a subset s

it is thus important to understand the extent to which the sampling properties of networks affect our inferences regarding structure, function and evolution. considerable effort has been invested in understanding, for example, the functional organization and evolutionary properties of pins, and contradictory results have been reported in the literature which are probably affected by many factors in addition to incomplete data. we have recently studied statistical sampling properties of network ensembles  <cit>  in considerable detail: the results suggest that when ≳80% of the nodes in a network are sampled at random, the shape of the degree distribution of the subnet, pr*, will be virtually indistinguishable from that of the true network. current pin data comprise interactions only among a relatively small number of the proteins known to be present in the different organisms. for s. cerevisiae, for which sampling is most complete, present publicly available data sets include interaction data among ≈ <dig> out of an estimated  <dig> proteins. we have therefore taken the present s. cerevisiae pin as a starting point for our analysis. we compare results for subnets with those of the assumed 'true' network. this study is meant as a qualitative investigation into how incomplete sampling has affected studies into pins and not as a quantitative assessment of the reliability of the present dataset. despite the noise in the present yeast pin, the s. cerevisiae data will give us a more realistic representation of a true pin than theoretical network models.

we will show that the sampling nature of a real network does indeed lead to different properties in the subnets compared with the true network. sampling properties of networks have hitherto been largely ignored – whereas the poor data quality has attracted considerable attention  <cit>  – but may lead to large variances and biases for network statistics obtained for different subnets, and act independently of noise. in light of the present analysis it may be necessary to reevaluate previous results for biological networks. in the context of systems biology this study demonstrates both the importance of performing carefully delimited studies of well-defined aspects of systems, and the potential pitfalls of analyzing only parts or components of complex biological systems. clearly the way the data have been collected needs to be considered before an analysis, and the sampling properties of networks need to be included in the analysis explicitly and from the outset.

RESULTS
network sampling schemes
assuming random sampling of nodes leads to great simplifications in the mathematical analysis  <cit> . in reality, however, experimenters are more likely to pick some proteins than others and quite generally we can assume that each protein has probability  <dig> <pi <  <dig>  then the number of nodes in the subnet is given by

sampling properties of networks
uncorrelated random networks are networks which are maximally random conditional on a given degree distribution  <cit>  ; in such a case it is possible to express expectation values of many interesting network characteristics in terms of the degree distribution pr; more interestingly, the degree sequence is a sufficient  statistic for uncorrelated networks. we can straightforwardly calculate the first two moments of the degree distribution in the subnet  <cit> , pr*:

as the sampling fraction increases from zero to one the sampeld network will undergo a structural phase transition  <cit>  in the limit n → ∞. one of the main consequences is the emergence of the giant connected component  <cit> . this is present  when the average number of next-nearest neighbours, z <dig> of a random node is on average greater than the number of its nearest neighbours z1; i.e.

subnet structures
a random subnet comprising e.g. p = 60% of the nodes of the true network differs quite substantially from the true network . the graph induced by the subset of nodes has a substantially smaller number of edges than the sampling fraction, p . for example, for p = 60% slightly more than a third of the interactions will be observed. trying to predict the size of interactomes by linear extrapolation from present data sets will thus underestimate the true interactome size  <cit> . for random sampling, however, it is in fact straightforward to predict the number of interactions: if a fraction p of nodes has been sampled, then the fraction of edges that has been sampled is simply the fraction of pairs of nodes, i.e. a random subnet with sampling probability p will have a proportion of p <dig> of the edges. for s. cerevisiae we have thus  <dig>  out of approximately  <dig> / <dig>  ≈  <dig>  interactions .

degree distribution
in figure 1a, as the sampling fraction decreases statistical weight tends to flow from high degrees to low degrees . moreover, at low degrees the degree distribution appears to become more power law-like as the sampling fraction decreases; this is a curious point given claims about scale-free properties of so many biological networks that are effectively subnets of the real network. previous analyses  <cit>  show, however, that even the degree distributions of subnets are generally qualitatively different from those of the true network; in particular if the degree distribution of the network takes on a power law form, the subnet  will have a qualitatively different degree distribution and vice versa.

on average a node with degree k in the global network will have degree pk  <cit>  in a randomly sampled subnet  and the peaks that are visible in the tail of the subnet degree distributions correspond to the most highly connected nodes in the full network: the maximum degree is  <dig> and corresponding peaks appear at ≈ <dig>  ≈ <dig>  ≈ <dig> and at ≈ <dig>  for sampling fractions of 80%, 60%, 40% and 20%, respectively, that were generated by random selection of nodes with probability p. because of the binomial sampling procedure used in generating networks, 
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbamrthrhal1wy0l2yhvtyaehbnfgdovwbhrxajfwnaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabawaaegaeaaakeaacyggqbaucqggybgcdawgaawcbaacdagae8nexpfabeaakiabcicaoiabdugarjabcmcapaaa@3e22@ is given by eqn.  , the most highly connected nodes will remain the same – as will their rank order and the relative proportion – in the subnets as in the global network, provided, of course, that they are included in the subnet; see figure  <dig> 

the effects of noise on the network data are shown in figure  <dig> where we have added, subtracted and rewired, respectively, a fraction of the interactions among nodes. qualitatively, we find that the shoulder of the degree distribution  is only little affected. particularly at low, but also at high degree, the shape of the distribution may also differ quite considerably. thus noise should generally distort the degree distribution in a different way from the way incomplete network data do.

clustering coefficients
betweenness
the dependence of betweenness or betweenness-centrality  on the sampling fraction is more subtle than that of the degree or clustering coefficient as it also depends on the global structure of the network. thus, for example, in different subnet samples the  <dig> proteins with the highest bc values change much more than the  <dig> proteins with the highest degrees. however, a very good correlation  between degree and bc is seen for all values of p .

motifs
in this study we pay particular attention to the six motifs defined by four nodes in an undirected graph . the observed range of the z-scores  for all motifs considered here decreases with subnet size. for each subnet size we observe considerable spread in the range of z-scores for the different motifs shown in figure 1c. motifs  <dig>  and  <dig> can have both negative and positive z-scores depending on the sample . for motif  <dig>  the most highly connected, we observe the biggest spread as well as a general increase in the average z-score with subnet size. in figure 1d we observe that the median z-score for motif  <dig> is the same in both the 20% and 40% subnets, and the 60% and 80% subnets, respectively. this is, however, entirely due to chance and to the high variance of motif z-scores in random subnets as is shown by further analyses . the importance of network data integrity and completeness is further exemplified by comparing the results in figure 1c with those in the original papers by milo et al.  <cit> ; here effects of the choice of data set also come into play  <cit> .

non-random ascertainment schemes
the degree distributions differ quite considerably between the different sampling schemes . it is particularly interesting to note that the high-confidence data network has the degree distribution which is most similar to the degree distribution of the complete data-set. bc is shown in part b of the same figure which confirms the results outlined above: there is a systematic increase with decreasing sampling fraction p or subnet size. there are some nodes which appear to be on the shortest paths between all  pairs of nodes. these do not, however, correspond to the most highly connected nodes, but rather occur for low degrees .

for the subnets constructed on the basis of protein expression data, we determined the 4-motif z-scores. in figure 3c it can be seen that all the motifs have similar z-scores in the different data sets except for the fully connected 4-motif. the z-scores of this motif do not exhibit a simple ordering, e.g. the subnet comprising the 80% of nodes with the highest expression levels exhibits higher z-scores than the subnet consisting of all nodes where expression level data is available. finally, this network has a z-score for motif  <dig> that is twice as high as that obtained for the full network. we also detect some systematic differences for motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these had z-scores ≈  <dig> in the true network and all randomly generated subnets , but have negative z-scores in the networks which are based on expression level. this suggests that experimental bias in designing interactome mapping studies will lead to systematic differences in motif spectra for different sampling schemes.

incomplete data and functional and evolutionary inferences
so far, we have considered only structural properties of networks. the interest in molecular networks lies, however, in the hope that they can explain the mechanisms underlying complex biological processes. their impact on the evolutionary properties of molecules has also been studied and here we seek to understand how informative inferences from subnets are about the properties of larger networks.

conditional on it being included in the subnet. eqn.  reflects the obvious point that the average rank of a node decreases with decreasing sampling fraction p. but because of eqn. , single node properties in the true network – e.g. frequency of protein domains  <cit>  or correlation between degree and expression level  <cit>  – will be statistically conserved in the subnets. we note that these results are qualitatively unaffected by the reported "stickiness" of some of the proteins in table  <dig> . in the table we also provide the number of interactions observed in the high-confidence database of interacting proteins   <cit>  data set. we find that the number of interactions reported for these proteins decreases dramatically  but that overall we find a reasonable level correlation between the degrees of proteins which are included in both data sets . discovering potential relationships between, for example, motifs and evolutionary and functional properties, as previously suggested  <cit> , is subject to the more disruptive effects of network sampling on such structures . given the results shown for motifs , such analyses may need to be carefully re-evaluated in light of the sampling nature of present network data.

discussion
we have explored effects of sampling on statistical measures of protein interaction structure for different sampling schemes. our comparison with the effects of noisy interaction data  suggests that sampling and noise affect network statistics in different ways and we have therefore concentrated on the sampling effects as noise has received considerable attention previously . previous studies of network sampling properties focused on the degree distribution  <cit> . in our analysis we confirmed the results of these earlier studies, but one aspect of this study deserves closer scrutiny: with decreasing sampling fraction the degree distribution of the randomly sampled subnets becomes straighter and the slope of the best-fit line becomes steeper. more interestingly, we find that for a data set which had previously  <cit>  been classified as consisting of more reliable interactions, the degree distribution appears to be reasonably similar to the degree distribution of the overall network , especially when compared with the randomly generated subnetwork ensemble.

not surprisingly, we find that the effects of sampling on other statistical measures such as clustering coefficient, betweenness and motifs are more intricate . as statistical measures become less local, the effects of sampling become increasingly subtle. for example, bc is a non-local property and the effects of sampling act locally as well as globally as the system undergoes a structural phase transition with the giant connected component  <cit>  breaking up as p decrease. thus the fraction of pairs of nodes which are connected  decreases and an increasing fraction of nodes has a bc value of  <dig>  on the other hand, the fraction of shortest paths passing through the connected nodes increases systematically.

motifs are local objects  <cit>  but z-scores are constructed using a global network-rewiring approach  <cit> . therefore their sampling properties are more intricate than those of subgraphs that are defined differently  <cit> . this dual nature of motifs – they are local objects but their significance is assessed against a globally randomized network ensemble – explains the qualitative differences in their behaviour under different sampling regimes.

in addition to the sampling properties, one result which becomes obvious from the present analysis is that subnets of the same size can differ quite considerably; and, in particular, the more complex measures of network structure such as motif spectra can exhibit variances that overwhelm the mean or median statistics. this becomes particularly apparent in figure 1c. it is partially for this reason that we have not emphasised the non-random sampling schemes more: a single instance of a network statistic represents only an instance of a sample drawn from an ensemble; for networks sampling of nodes leads to very broad distributions of sample statistics as would be expected for such highly correlated and structured data sets  <cit> . sampling and noise affect these network statistics differently, with incomplete data introducing variability as well as systematic bias, and noise affecting almost exclusively the variance in, for example, the z-scores of motifs.

for random subnets we also compared evolutionary results previously obtained for the "complete network" for the randomly generated networks. in agrafioti et al.  <cit>  only the effects of local structure  were used and in light of the previous discussion it is therefore not surprising that the central results are generally confirmed in the subnets: in particular protein expression level correlates better than degree with protein evolutionary/substitution rate. for the non-random sampling schemes the data are biased in favour of protein abundance and results are also confirmed, but potentially biased somewhat against degree. in general, single-node properties of proteins are statistically conserved in the subnet, e.g. the protein with the highest degree will, provided it is being included in the sample, tend to have the highest degree also in the subnet. as far as biological and functional inferences are concerned, the effects of network sampling properties appear to be not very different from statistical missing data problems. thus the biological studies, which investigate, for example, the interplay between protein domain structure and protein interactions  <cit>  are probably not affected. investigating such properties across a network  <cit> , however, may be subject to bias because of the intricacies displayed by the network sampling behaviour discussed here.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our analysis shows that it is important to include the sampling nature of biological networks explicitly and from the outset. failure to do so may have given rise to biases in previous network analyses. in particular this is the case for statistics which involve more than one node such as motif spectra  <cit>  or pairwise similarities of nodes  <cit> . in other branches of the quantitative biosciences, notably population genetics  <cit> , the effects of sampling and their importance are well understood. the same is not true for the fledgling field of systems biology.

noise and incompleteness affect network data in subtly different ways. as we have shown here, a subnet is much less than a part of the whole network and failure to account for this will bias inferences.
