BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion/deletion events  represent the most frequent polymorphisms found in eukaryotic genomes. for example, in humans the frequency of snp polymorphisms is one per kilobase and given the large size of the human genome the total number of snps has been estimated to be over of  <dig>  million  <cit> . similarly, high snp frequencies have been reported in plant genomes, especially in out-crossing species, but the discovery process has been slower despite the small genomes of some species. examples include grapevine , an out-crossing species, where one snp occurs every  <dig> bp  <cit>  or maize  where the average frequency of snps was one every  <dig> bases in  <dig>  maize gene sequences and where indels were also common  <cit> . in a self pollinated species such as soybean  merr), the snp frequency was reported as one snp every  <dig> bp in non-coding regions and one snp every two kilobases in coding regions based on  <dig> genotypes and  <dig> genomic or gene fragments  <cit> . rice , another inbreeding species, had one snp every  <dig> bp in coding regions and one snp every  <dig> bp in transposable elements when comparing indica and japonica subspecies  <cit>  and recently  <dig>  high-quality, non-redundant snps were found across the entire rice genome  <cit> . in this study, our interest was to develop snp and indel based markers for common bean , an important legume in terms of food security but one that has been less well studied as it is found mostly in developing countries.

expressed sequence tag  libraries offer important information for species that have not been sequenced and are a central source of gene-based markers and snp or indel polymorphisms. discovery of these polymorphisms usually involves alignment of sequences obtained from the sequencing of est libraries from different genotypes of the same species  <cit>  or from re-sequencing of pcr fragments  <cit> . est-based markers are valuable because they represent sequences that are transcribed and therefore can potentially be associated with phenotypic differences. furthermore, est based markers are often highly conserved between species allowing the construction of transcript maps and synteny comparisons between genomes.

est analysis in common bean shows that snp frequency appears to be similar or higher than in other self-pollinating species although fairly few studies have analyzed their relative abundance across different regions of the genome or across the wide diversity of common bean accessions. in a pioneering study for the crop, ramirez et al.  <cit>  found that snp frequency in est sequences from two genotypes of common bean  was  <dig> snps in  <dig> kb of snp-containing contigs, with a frequency of one snp every  <dig> bp in this inter-genepool comparison. recently, gaitán-solís et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels in  <dig> gene-coding and non-coding fragments analyzed in  <dig> cultivated and wild bean genotypes belonging to the mesoamerican and andean gene pools finding an average frequency of one snp every  <dig> bp and one indel every  <dig> bp. the high frequency of snps and overall genotype diversity in common bean makes this species amenable to snp marker development.

est conversion to snp based molecular markers and their use in saturation or comparative mapping has been an important recent area of research and several techniques for snp analysis have been reported  <cit> . for example, in common bean three methods have been used for est marker conversion based on snp polymorphisms. in the first, cleaved amplified pcr fragment techniques  were used to convert est based polymorphisms into genetic markers  <cit> . a second attempt involved a high-throughput system named luminex- <dig> which was used to confirm snp calls in dna from  <dig> common bean genotypes, finding  <dig> % of snps were miscalled and 1% had no signal as compared with direct sequencing  <cit> . in an effort to simplify snp analysis, galeano et al.  <cit>  used cel i mismatch digestions to analyze and map snp-based, est-derived markers, finding that the method worked well with snps located in the middle of amplification fragments and that digestion products could be visualized on agarose gels.

some of these techniques require specialized equipment or ingredients, which some molecular marker laboratories may not have. therefore, a recent goal in our laboratory has been to identify a gel-based alternative that does not require restriction enzyme digestion. in this regard, we have found single strand conformational polymorphism  analysis to be a good alternative. the sscp technique is based on conformational differences of single stranded dna fragments that can be detected as mobility shifts in non-denaturing polyacryilamide gel electrophoresis  <cit> . this technique is easy and inexpensive to implement as we show in this study and has been used to analyzing gene or est derived snp markers in various plant species such as wheat  <cit> , barley  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , cassava  <cit> , pearl millet  <cit>  and pinus species  <cit> .

in this study, our objective was to develop and map sscp markers on an integrated genetic map for common bean using est or gene-based markers from various sources. the molecular mapping of genic snps and indels through this technique also provided the basis to analyze synteny of homologous loci across the legumes. in relation to this, the genetic map information and the marker sequences were used for an analysis of macro-synteny between the genome of common bean and the genomes of glycine max, lotus japonicus  and medicago truncatula .

RESULTS
parental survey
after the standardization process, a total of  <dig> amplicons were successfully amplified on the four genotypes evaluated. of these,  <dig> amplicons were derived from snp containing est sequences of ramirez et al.  <cit>  and corresponded to bsnp markers either newly developed here or from galeano et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> amplicons were from the "g" series developed by ndsu and  <dig> amplicons were from the snp containing fragments reported by gaitán-solís et al.  <cit> . figure 1a shows examples of polymorphic and monomorphic pcr products evaluated on agarose gels for indel type size polymorphisms. in that figure, amplicons for g <dig> and g <dig> presented clear size polymorphisms between andean genotypes  and mesoamerican genotypes , while the amplicons for g <dig> and g <dig> showed monomorphism in product size. the amplicons for bsnp <dig>  bsnp <dig> and bsnp <dig>  were also monomorphic in size  but as described in additional file  <dig> were designed to cover the snps in contig  <dig> from ramirez et al.  <cit> . all of these amplicons are examples of the quality and specificity of the amplicon required to initiate the sscp technique. in total,  <dig> amplicons showed size polymorphisms showing that indels are not frequent in the marker set used in this study.

sscp polymorphism, meanwhile, was found in  <dig> out of the  <dig> amplicons tested in the parental survey for mapping parents used in this study. this included screening on mde gels of all the amplicons that did not contain indel polymorphisms from the agarose gel screening. the overall sscp polymorphism rate was similar for the parents of the populations dor <dig> × g <dig>  and bat <dig> × jalo eep <dig>  with the former cross selected for genetic mapping. figure 1c show examples of amplicons with clear conformational polymorphisms between the andean and mesoamerican genotypes using the sscp technique. among the polymorphic amplicons for the mapping population,  <dig> were for bsnp markers from galeano et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> were for 'g' markers and  <dig> were for markers from gaitán-solis et al  <cit> .

pcr product size was not found to affect sscp detection in the bsnp markers and this method could be used for amplicons up to  <dig> kb in size. for example, figure 1c shows the electrophoresis profile of parental genotypes divided into groups a, b and c consisting in light molecular weight , medium molecular weight  and high molecular weight  products, respectively, proving the versatility of the mde technique to detect sscps in amplicons with a wide range of molecular weights. gel migration was lengthier for the larger molecular weight fragments than for the smaller molecular weight fragments with as little as four hours of run time needed for the first group and  <dig> hours needed for the third group. it was notable, that some amplicons for the bsnp markers presented molecular weights in agarose gel evaluation that were greater than expected, suggested the presence of intronic regions, even though primer design had been based on fragments of  <dig> bp or less. pcr products were obtained up to  <dig> bp  and the smallest amplicons were as small as  <dig> bp  and both extremes were equally amenable to sscp evaluation.

molecular mapping and linkage analysis
after the parental screening, the polymorphic amplicons were evaluated as genetic markers for the entire dor <dig> × g <dig> rils population. all  <dig> resulting loci evaluated with the sscp technique were placed in the linkage map, along with a further  <dig> indel based markers evaluated for segregation with agarose gels. figure  <dig> shows examples of the sscp based markers evaluated in the population having typical segregation pattern for parental alleles of 1: <dig> for a co-dominant marker evaluated in a recombinant inbred line population. in the case of the marker g <dig> a few heterozygous individuals were detected. apart from the sscp detection, one marker was mapped with cel i heteroduplex digestion as reported by galeano et al.  <cit>  for a total of  <dig> markers evaluated in the population for the genetic mapping portion of this study. the  <dig> amplicons/markers evaluated with agarose gel evaluation were g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  gcv <dig> while the marker evaluated using cel i heteroduplex digestion was bsnp <dig>  segregation of the new marker loci was analyzed along with the  <dig> ssr, sts and rflp markers reported by blair et al.  <cit> , caldas and blair  <cit>  and beebe et al.  <cit>  as well as five cel i based gene markers reported by galeano et al.  <cit> .

the final genetic map which is shown in figure  <dig> and summarized in the table  <dig> had  <dig> marker loci in total with a full map length of  <dig>  cm. linkage group sizes ranged from  <dig> cm  to  <dig> cm  with an average of  <dig> cm per linkage group. the number of marker loci per linkage group ranged from  <dig> on b <dig> to  <dig> on b <dig>  the largest number of new marker loci  was placed on linkage group b <dig> but an average of  <dig> new loci were placed on each linkage group. the average distance between the est-based marker loci and the ssr or rflp marker loci was  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively and the average distance between all loci was  <dig>  cm. in general, the marker loci were well distributed within the linkage groups; however, some markers clustered in certain regions of b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  segregation distortion was found for 19% of the new marker loci  which is similar to values in blair et al. . in general the most highly distorted marker loci were found on b <dig> and presented preferential transmission of the g <dig> allele. the same distortion was found in the middle of b01; while preferential transmission of the dor <dig> alleles was found at the top of the b <dig> 

synteny analysis
a total of  <dig> markers were used for the synteny analysis based on sequences of est contigs or singletons corresponding to the assembly of the new sscp and indel based markers or the sequences for ssrs from blair et al.  <cit>  and rflps from murray et al.  <cit>  with the est collection of  <dig>  sequences from genbank. the resulting marker-based sequences were aligned against genomic sequences of soybean showing  <dig> significant homologies based on a first hit e-value average of 10- <dig>  in addition, a second match was recorded for the blastn evaluation, because the soybean genome has had at least two rounds of polyploidization  <cit> , and therefore presumably has at least two homologous copies of each common bean gene or est represented in distinct positions of its genome. a total of  <dig> of the markers evaluated were found to have a significant second match with the soybean genome. the first hit markers from the homology search against the soybean genome were distributed across all  <dig> linkage groups of the common bean genetic map as shown in figure  <dig> where the syntenic relationships for each marker are indicated with flanking boxes identifying the soybean chromosome where its homolog or homologs are found. on average  <dig> such conserved markers were present in each common bean linkage group with the most syntenic relationships discovered for b <dig>  and the least for b <dig> .

comparative mapping and sequence positioning between common bean and soybean presented a mosaic pattern where it was possible to identify syntenic regions based on three or more markers matching from the same chromosome of soybean to the same region of a common bean linkage group. through this analysis, most common bean linkage groups could be represented by several re-arranged soybean chromosomes as seen in figure  <dig>  for example, segments of linkage group b <dig> presented synteny with three pairs of soybean chromosomes , namely the top segment of b <dig> with gm <dig> in first hits and gm <dig> in second hits, the middle segment with gm <dig> and gm <dig> and the bottom segment with gm <dig> and gm <dig>  linkage group b <dig> presented synteny with gm <dig> and gm8; and at the bottom with gm <dig>  linkage group b <dig> was syntenic with gm <dig> and gm <dig> along most of its entire length; while b <dig> showed synteny with gm <dig> at the top of the linkage group, with gm <dig> in the middle and with gm <dig> and gm <dig> at the bottom. linkage group b <dig> had synteny with gm <dig> and gm <dig> although second hits were variable; while b <dig> presented a syntenic block with gm <dig> and gm <dig> at the top of the linkage group, with gm <dig> and gm <dig> in the middle and with gm <dig> at the bottom. b <dig> showed a syntenic block with gm <dig> and gm <dig> except at the bottom of the linkage group; while b <dig> showed synteny with gm <dig> and gm <dig> at the top, and with gm <dig> at the bottom. linkage group b <dig> showed a syntenic block with gm <dig> and gm7; while b <dig> was syntenic with gm  <dig> at the top, and gm <dig> in the bottom. finally, b <dig> was mostly syntenic with a single pair of soybean chromosomes, gm <dig> and gm <dig>  along its entire length except at the very end.

the synteny analysis with m. truncatula and l. japonicus resulted in totals of  <dig> and  <dig> homologous markers linked to the common bean genome, respectively. these represented averages of  <dig> and  <dig> anchor markers per linkage group in p. vulgaris for the two model legume genomes, respectively. as seen in figure  <dig>  linkage group b <dig> showed various syntenic blocks with l. japonicus , or m. truncatula chromosomes . linkage group b <dig> showed syntenic blocks with lj <dig> and lj <dig>  but no clear synteny with the medicago chromosomes. linkage group b <dig> showed segmental synteny with lj <dig>  mt <dig> and mt <dig>  b <dig> showed syntenic blocks from lj <dig> and mt <dig>  and interestingly with mt <dig>  a "false" chromosome where unanchored sequences from the medicago genome project are temporarily housed. linkage group b <dig> showed a syntenic block with lj3; while b <dig> showed a syntenic block with lj <dig> and mt <dig>  linkage group b <dig> showed a syntenic block with mt1; b <dig> with mt <dig> and mt <dig> and b <dig> with lj <dig>  meanwhile, linkage groups b <dig> and b <dig> did not have a clear synteny with the other legume genomes. in summary, the synteny analysis of common bean with the genomes of medicago, lotus and soybean showed that 50%, 36% and 85% of the bean anchor markers had similarity with genes from these species, respectively.

discussion
value of the sscp based markers for map saturation
this study creates a transcript map for common bean based on markers evaluated with sscp gels which was found to be an easy to use marker system to screen for single base substitutions and snp polymorphisms as well as small insertion-deletion events. in terms of marker development and testing, a total of  <dig> amplicons have now been developed as part of the bsnp series which we began the development of for the analysis of cel i assays as described in galeano et al.  <cit>  and which are based on the  <dig> doubly-confirmed snps detected in ramirez et al.  <cit> . in addition we tested a total of  <dig> amplicons for sscp and indel polymorphisms based on the gene-derived markers from gaitan-solís et al.  <cit>  and the est derived markers from ndsu  <cit> . genetic mapping was shown to be successful with the snp and indel detection techniques used in this study. out of the full set of  <dig> amplicons tested, a total of  <dig> could be located on the genetic map of common bean using the inter-genepool population dor <dig> × g <dig> creating a more saturated genetic map for common bean.

the new map presents important advantages since it is based on a combination of cdna-based and non-gene markers, integrating the  <dig> new est and gene-based marker loci into a map that already had  <dig> ssr, sts or rflp markers for this population from blair et al.  <cit> , caldas and blair  <cit>  and beebe et al.  <cit> . the result is one of the most dense as well as most diverse molecular maps available for common bean to date with a total of  <dig> single copy markers mapped in this population and a full set of  <dig> markers for the population if we include aflp, rga, rapd and scar markers also mapped in this population as described in those previous publications. the success rate for the amplicons tested in this study in terms of mapping with the sscp detection techniques was between 47% and 22% depending on the source of the markers. for example, of the  <dig> snp-est contigs reported by ramirez et al  <cit>  we were able to map  <dig> in this study building on and improving over the initial mapping conducted in our earlier study , tepary bean , cowpea  and soybean  <cit> . in this study, we took advantage of the nearly full genome sequences now available for soybean, medicago truncatula and lotus japonicus  <cit>  to conduct macrosynteny analysis with common bean based on homology searches for the sequenced markers on our genetic map. similar studies have been conducted using orthologous markers with or without sequence information across various crop and model legumes by bertioli et al  <cit> . cannon et al.  <cit> , choi et al.  <cit> , hisano et al.  <cit> , hougaard et al.  <cit>  and tsubokura et al.  <cit> .

the synteny results from our study comparing common bean linkage groups with soybean chromosomes showed large macrosyntenic segments between parts of 'homeologous' chromosome pairs from the ancestrally polyploidy genome of soybean syntenic and different parts of the diploid common bean genome. this allowed us to align most of the  <dig> soybean chromosomes to the  <dig> individual linkage groups of common bean in paired segments as shown in additional file  <dig> . the syntenic blocks found between common bean and soybean gm10-b <dig>  gm16-b <dig>  gm5-b <dig>  gm19/gm15/gm12-b <dig>  gm18-b <dig>  gm3-b <dig>  gm12/gm11-b <dig> and gm6-b <dig> were consistent with the rflp based comparisons of the linkage maps of soybean, common bean and vigna radiata  <cit> . in addition, the specific synteny of gm11/gm <dig> with b <dig> was corroborated by lee et al  <cit>  comparing the genome organization of these same three legumes around the genes pa <dig> and pa <dig> which encode pubescence in soybean.

our results agree with previous studies suggesting that the soybean genome has undergone two or more large scale duplications and is probably an ancient polyploid  <cit> . based on the common bean model, we identify some of the duplicate chromosome regions in soybean. for example, linkage group b <dig> showed synteny with regions of both gm <dig> and gm <dig> . duplication of this chromosome from soybean was found when mapping bacs containing paralogous ω- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  genes  <cit> . i n addition, our synteny results for linkage group b <dig> infer a duplication of gm <dig> and gm <dig>  as was also found by schlueter et al.  <cit>  when sequencing homeologuos bacs anchored by mapped duplicate n-hydroxycinnamoyl benzoyltransferase  genes. other soybean chromosome duplications we detected included gm13-gm  <dig> , gm8-gm <dig> , gm13-gm <dig> , gm18-gm <dig> , gm2- <dig> , gm4-gm <dig>  and gm11-gm <dig> . these results are consistent with the duplication analysis carried out by shoemaker et al.  <cit>  using rflp markers and the synteny results of hisano et al  <cit> , and tsubokura et al.  <cit> . our study, therefore, confirms results of shoemaker et al.  <cit> , showing that compared to common bean, the soybean genome is the result of a duplicated ancestral genome that was re-arranged to produce  <dig> non-homologous chromosomes with many homeologous regions among chromosome pairs. so far, macro-synteny studies among other legumes have revealed that the genome structure is relatively stable within the subfamily papilionoideae albeit with many of these segmental rearrangements  <cit> .

the synteny analysis with medicago and lotus compared to the linkage groups in common bean identified many more rearrangements. despite this, chromosomes lj <dig> and lj <dig> were found to be related to linkage group b <dig>  lj <dig> and mt <dig> to b <dig>  mt <dig> and lj <dig> to b <dig>  mt <dig> to b <dig>  mt <dig> and mt <dig> to b <dig>  mt <dig> to b <dig> and b <dig>  mt <dig> to b <dig>  lj <dig> to b <dig> and mt <dig> to b <dig>  similar results are reported by hougaard et al.  <cit>  who analyzed  <dig> and  <dig> shared loci, respectively, between lotus or medicago and common bean and by choi et al.  <cit>  who compared various galegoid and phaseoloid genomes using cross species genetic markers. results comparing soybean with lotus by hisano et al.  <cit>  and tsubokura et al.  <cit>  found a limited degree of macrosynteny between these species, perhaps because of the complex structure of the soybean genome compared to the simpler structure of the lotus genome. interestingly, in both our study and the one from hougaard et al.  <cit> , it was almost impossible to find synteny for linkage groups b <dig> and b <dig> due to few anchor markers in these regions suggesting that these linkage groups have lower number of conserved or transcribed sequences.

the correspondence of our results with the synteny blocks  of cannon et al.  <cit>  appear to be most robust on b <dig> and b <dig> for sequences from sb <dig> and sb <dig> , on b <dig> for sb <dig> , and on b <dig> and b <dig> for sb <dig> and sb <dig> , respectively. synteny blocks were also evident in the studies of young et al.  <cit>  and hougaard et al.  <cit> . meanwhile, bertioli et al.  <cit>  identified differences in syntenic blocks between peanut  and medicago or lotus, finding that retrotransposon-rich regions are distributed in alternating blocks across these legume genomes and that these are interspersed between syntenic blocks and correspond to the variable regions which do not show synteny.

similar results in comparative mapping using ests and gene based markers have allowed the identification of homologous linkage groups in studies of related pinus species  <cit> , or across m. truncatula and m. sativa  <cit> . comparative mapping across distantly related species is also possible with conserved markers used to compare the sugar beet transcript map with the arabidopsis genome  <cit>  or sequence comparisons of arabidopsis and rice  <cit>  with a few syntenic blocks always found, suggesting limited co-linearity between distant dicotyledonous or angiosperm genomes. the long time of divergence  between galegoid and phaseoloid clades  <cit>  would explain the less frequent homologies between common bean markers and lotus or medicago genomes compared to hits with the soybean genome. our results confirm the reduced level of conservation between galegoid  and phaseoloid  legumes as reported choi et al.  <cit>  concluding that synteny is high among closely related species, and that the degree of synteny declines with increasing phylogenetic distance.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the sscp technique in common bean was found to be a useful alternative marker system for the genetic analysis of est-based amplicons and snp or indel based polymorphisms. we reported the versatility of this technique given its capacity to analyze a wide range of pcr fragment sizes using simple equipment and standard conditions. the sscp technique was especially useful for saturating the common bean map with gene derived marker loci, and the resulting transcript map was then used for macrosynteny analysis with soybean, lotus and medicago genomes. we expect that the est and gene based map will be useful for positional cloning and for dissection of quantitative traits, and the identification of the genes underlying these. in this regard the enhanced map for dor <dig> × g <dig> may provide us with the tools for map-based cloning of qtl for low phosphorus tolerance, high nutritional quality and other high priority traits discovered by our laboratory for this population  <cit> . in addition, the markers will be useful as tools for marker assisted selection in common bean and for the further analysis of phylogenetic relationships and conserved regions between the genome of this crop and those of model legumes  <cit> . furthermore, these results offer a valuable framework for utilizing sequence information from soybean and model legumes for further marker development and gene characterization in common bean.
