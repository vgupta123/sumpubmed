BACKGROUND
neurotrophins are a family of growth factors that play important roles in the nervous system. they exert multiple functions, being crucial for the survival and maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in axon and dendrite patterning. recent evidence has shown that neurotrophins also act as modulators in synaptic plasticity and are consequently involved in cognitive processes, learning and memory formation  <cit> .

in mammals, the neurotrophin family is composed of four members: nerve growth factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , neurotrophin- <dig> , and neurotrophin-4/ <dig> . each member binds with high affinity to a specific neurotrophic tyrosine kinase  receptor: ngf is the preferred ligand for ntrk <dig> , bdnf and nt4/ <dig> for ntrk <dig> , and nt <dig> for ntrk <dig>   <cit> . upon neurotrophin-induced stimulation, ntrk receptors can activate the ras/mapk pathway, the pi3k  pathway, and/or plc-γ <dig> -dependent signaling, respectively promoting cell survival, differentiation and activity-dependent plasticity.

neurotrophins exert neuroprotective activity against different paradigms of neuronal cell death  <cit> , linking neurotrophic factors, in particular ngf, to neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . neurotrophins and their receptors have also been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric and mood disorders, often in a dosage-dependent manner  <cit> . as for many other growth factors, the deregulation of neurotrophin signal transduction is involved in several types of cancers, where ntrk receptor activation can either support or suppress tumor growth. this is the case for example of ntrk <dig>  which is highly expressed in neuroblastomas with good prognosis and highly correlates with patient survival  <cit> .

the human ntrk <dig> gene is located on chromosome 15q <dig> and spans ~ <dig> kb of genomic dna . it contains  <dig> introns and undergoes alternative splicing. in humans, three transcript variants have been well characterized: a full-length catalytic form  containing a tyrosine kinase  domain, a full-length isoform  with an insertion of  <dig> amino acids in the tk domain - which is less abundant and shows reduced signaling potential  <cit>  - and a single non-catalytic truncated form  that completely lacks the tk domain  <cit> . two major protein isoforms have correspondingly been detected in human brain samples: the full-length, kinase-active 150-kda receptor  and a truncated non-catalytic isoform  of  <dig> kda  <cit> . the main function that has long been attributed to the truncated isoform is the inhibition of catalytic receptors, which is achieved through a dominant-negative or a ligand-sequestering mechanism. however, a recent work has identified a new signaling pathway activated by the truncated isoform, which links nt <dig> to downstream molecules affecting membrane remodeling, cytoskeletal reorganization and cell movement, such as the scaffold protein tamalin, the rac <dig> gtpase and the adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor arf <dig>  <cit> .

in humans, the full-length receptor is expressed at low but relatively constant levels throughout development, while the truncated receptor is expressed at moderate levels early in development and increases to reach mature levels by adolescence. in contrast, both full-length and truncated transcripts are uniformly expressed throughout postnatal life and decline in ageing  <cit> . this discrepancy between changes in protein and mrna levels of ntrk <dig> suggests that post-transcriptional regulation may play a role in controlling the expression of the two isoforms, in addition to alternative splicing.

micrornas  are post-transcriptional regulators that have been shown to play a key role in the nervous system. the distribution of mirnas in the developing and adult nervous system is spatially and/or temporally restricted  <cit> , indicating that they may contribute to the fine-tuning of neuronal gene expression. structurally, mature mirnas are small rnas of approximately  <dig> nucleotides in length, and regulate gene expression by means of partial complementarity to mirna binding sites located in the 3' untranslated regions  of target mrnas  <cit> . in particular, perfect complementarity between nucleotide # <dig> through # <dig> or # <dig> at the 5' end of the mature mirna - the so-called seed region - and the 3'utr of genes is considered determinant for successful binding  <cit> . genes with long 3'utrs are more prone to mirna-mediated regulation compared with genes with short 3'utrs, which tend to be specifically deprived of mirna target sites  <cit> . interestingly, full-length and truncated ntrk <dig> transcripts show different 3'utr regions that do not overlap, supporting the hypothesis that the two isoforms may be differentially regulated by mirnas. furthermore, it has recently been shown that mirnas mir- <dig> and mir-125a/b are able to specifically regulate the expression of the truncated isoform of the ntrk <dig> receptor  <cit> .

only one study has so far analyzed the contribution of mirnas to determining the balance between different variants of the same gene  <cit> . here, we show that the full-length and truncated isoforms of ntrk <dig> are regulated by different sets of mirnas. in addition, we demonstrate that, among the mirnas that inhibit the truncated isoform, the overexpression of mir- <dig> - a brain-enriched mirna - in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells alters the expression profile of genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and of genes related with apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, including the anti-apoptotic factor bcl <dig> 

methods
firefly luciferase constructs
the 3'utrs of the full-length and truncated isoforms of ntrk <dig> were pcr-amplified from bac ctd-2508h <dig> with pfuturbo® dna polymerase , using primers containing an xbai restriction site at the 5' end: forward 5'-acacactctagagtctgccccaaagaggtgta-3' and reverse 5'-acacactctagaccaaactgccttacagggttt-3' for the full-length isoform and forward 5'-acacactctagaaataagccttcccggacatt-3' and reverse 5'-acacactctagatgcaaaatttccaaataagagg-3' for the truncated isoform. pcr fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively were purified, xbai-digested and cloned into an xbai site located downstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the pgl <dig>  vector . constructs were propagated in e. coli one shot® top  <dig> cells . mutant reporter plasmids were generated as previously described  <cit>  using the quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit , with the wild-type pgl <dig>  construct as a template and primers carrying the desired point mutations. the authenticity and orientation of the inserts as well as the presence of the mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing.

cell culture and transfection
hela cells and sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig> units/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin . in the case of sh-sy5y cells, fetal bovine serum was heat inactivated for  <dig> min at 56°c prior to use. transfection with small rnas was performed with lipofectamine  <dig> , using either small rnas that mimic endogenous mature mirnas and the related negative controls  or mirna inhibitors and the corresponding negative control . the cotransfection of plasmid dna and small rnas into hela cells was optimized using a gfp-containing plasmid  and a commercially available gfp-specific sirna , obtaining a transfection efficiency of over 80%. transfection of sh-sy5y cells with mirna mimics was optimized and monitored in each experiment using a fluorescein-labeled double-stranded rna oligomer . optimal efficiency was obtained at a concentration of 50- <dig> nm and mirna mimics as well as mirna inhibitors were ultimately used at  <dig> nm.

luciferase activity assay
hela cells were seeded at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/well in 96-well plates and cotransfected  <dig> h later with the firefly reporter constructs described above or the empty pgl <dig>  vector , the renilla reporter plasmid pgl <dig>   and the appropriate mirna mimic . the activity of firefly and renilla luciferases was determined  <dig> h after transfection using the dual-glo™ luciferase assay system . relative reporter activity was obtained by normalization to the renilla luciferase activity. in order to correct for vector-dependent unspecific effects, each relative reporter activity was normalized to the empty vector cotransfected with the corresponding mirna. results were then compared to the mean of the two negative controls. each experiment was done in triplicate and at least three independent experiments were performed for each mirna. statistical significance was determined using student's t test .

western blotting
for the analysis of ntrk <dig> expression during ra-induced differentiation, sh-sy5y cells were treated with  <dig> μm all-trans-ra and harvested at time  <dig> , day  <dig>  day  <dig> and day  <dig> of ra treatment. for tr-ntrk <dig>  undifferentiated sh-sy5y cells were plated at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well in 6-well plates and transfected  <dig> h later with  <dig> nm mirna mimic;  <dig> h after transfection cells were lysed and analyzed by western blotting. for fl-ntrk <dig>  sh-sy5y cells were differentiated with  <dig> μm all-trans-ra, plated in 6-well plates at a concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well at day  <dig> of ra treatment, transfected with  <dig> nm mirna mimic at day  <dig> of ra treatment and analyzed  <dig> h after transfection .

for protein extraction, cells were rapidly rinsed with ice-cold pbs and solubilized with ripa buffer:  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> % sds, 1% nonidet p  <dig>  1% sodium deoxycholate,  <dig> mm na3vo <dig>   <dig> mm pmsf,  <dig> mm naf and 1× protease inhibitors . cells were then scraped off, incubated on ice for  <dig> min and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. samples were resolved in nupage® 4-12% bis-tris polycrylamide gels using the nupage® mes sds running buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the iblot™dry blotting system . before blotting, gels were equilibrated in  <dig> ml equilibration buffer  for  <dig> min at room temperature .

immunodetection was performed using the odyssey® infrared imaging system , following the manufacturer's instructions for two-color western blotting. this detection system allows the precise quantification of low-abundance proteins  for which chemiluminescence is not enough sensitive and accurate, and has the advantage that the signal generated by the proteins on the membrane is measured in a static state. membranes were blocked in odyssey® blocking buffer for  <dig> h at rt and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody  for  <dig> h at rt , santa cruz, catalog number sc-492; anti-caspase- <dig>  millipore, catalog number 06-735; anti-caspase- <dig>  cell signaling, catalog number 9508). as a loading control, membranes were simultaneously incubated with an anti-gapdh ab . blots were subsequently probed with the appropriate fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies  and finally scanned on an odyssey® infrared scanner. fluorescent bands were quantified using the odyssey® software. each experiment was repeated at least four times; data are reported as means ± se and statistical significance was determined using student's t test.

for the analysis of erk phosphorylation, differentiated cells were seeded and transfected as explained above;  <dig> h after transfection cells were rinsed twice with serum-free medium, incubated with serum-free medium for  <dig> h and then acutely stimulated for  <dig> min with  <dig> ng/ml neurotrophin- <dig> . cells were then lysed in  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm naf,  <dig> mm sodium pyrophosphate and  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  after transfer, membranes were incubated with an anti-phopsho-erk  and an anti-pan-erk ab . to make sure that the quantification was accurate in each wb, a gradient  of one of the control samples was loaded on each gel. the gradients of fl-ntrk <dig>  tr-ntrk <dig> and gapdh were quantified by densitometry, and the corresponding standard curve equations were calculated for each wb; blots were considered reliable only if standard curves showed a correlation coefficient  >  <dig>  . standard curve equations were then applied to the densitometry counts of each sample for quantification.

mirna expression analysis using custom microarrays 
total rna, including short rnas, was extracted from hela and sh-sy5y cells using the mirneasy® mini kit . mirna expression in hela and sh-sy5y cells was analyzed using custom 11k oligonucleotide microarrays , including probes for the  <dig> known human mirnas according to sanger mirbase release  <dig> . the expression values obtained were compared with results reported in other studies  <cit> , and the general correlation was good; however, to avoid possible false results due to a failure in the hybridization of specific individual probes, we eliminated from subsequent analysis those mirnas whose expression values were discordant with the other studies. negative controls included probes for  <dig> bacillus subtilis-specific sequences and  <dig> rare non-human sequences. two μg of total rna were labeled with hy5™or hy3™fluorescent labels using the mircury™lna microrna labelling kit , following the manufacturer's instructions. pairs of labeled samples were hybridized to dual-channel microarrays for  <dig> h at 55°c using agilent hybridization reagents. microarray images were quantified using the genepix  <dig>   software; only spots with signal intensities twice above the local background and not saturated were considered reliable and used for subsequent analysis. extracted intensities were subtracted from the local background and the log <dig> ratios were normalized in an intensity-dependent fashion. statistical analyses were performed using the mmarge tool.

whole-genome expression analysis using beadchip microarrays
total rna samples obtained from four independent experiments  were analyzed on humanref- <dig> beadchips from illumina, which target  <dig>  well-annotated refseq transcripts. starting from  <dig> ng of total rna, biotin-labeled crna was synthesized and hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions. data were analyzed using the array file maker   <dig>  software package. the whole genome microarray data obtained here are part of a larger project that is still ongoing. these results will be deposited in miame format in the arrayexpress public repository once the experiment is completed.

real-time quantitative rt-pcr
dnase-treated rna extracted from transfected cells was retrotranscribed with the superscript™iii first-strand synthesis system for rt-pcr . rna levels of the full-length and truncated isoforms of ntrk <dig> were analyzed by real-time quantitative rt-pcr using sybr green i , following the manufacturer's instructions. reactions were performed with the lightcycler®  <dig> instrument  in 384-multiwell plates. specific primers were designed for the two ntrk <dig> isoforms  and for gapdh , which was used as housekeeping gene. all amplicons were ~ <dig> bp in length, and forward and reverse primers were located in different exons. thermal cycling was performed as follows: one pre-incubation cycle at 95°c for  <dig> min ;  <dig> amplification cycles at 95°c for  <dig> sec, 57°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> sec . the expression levels of mir- <dig> in different human tissues and in sh-sy5y cells were analyzed using the taqman® microrna assays, following the manufacturer's instructions.

cell counting
cells cultured on 6-well plates and transfected with mir- <dig>  the tr-ntrk3-specific sirna  and the related negative controls were trypsinized and resuspended in  <dig> ml dmem;  <dig> μl of each sample were then diluted in  <dig> ml of coulter isoton ii diluent  and counted using a z2™ series coulter particle count and size analyzer .

flow cytometry
sh-sy5y cells transfected with mir- <dig> and the related negative controls were trypsinized and resuspended in pbs  <dig> h after transfection cells. samples were examined using a bd facscanto flow cytometer and the bd facsdiva software . a two-parameter forward/side scatter  analysis was performed recording  <dig> events in each analysis.

computational methods
three web-based mirna target prediction methods were used: miranda , targetscan  and pictar . genomic coordinates were according to the human assembly release of march  <dig> . sequences were obtained from the university of california santa cruz  genome browser http://www.genome.ucsc.edu. sequence analysis was performed using the 4peaks software http://mekentosj.com/4peaks/ and multalin http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/. primers were designed using the primer <dig> software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer <dig> cgi and pcr annealing temperatures were calculated with the optimase protocolwriter™ http://mutationdiscovery.com. pathway analysis from microarray expression data was performed with the ingenuity pathway analysis software  version  <dig>  http://www.ingenuity.com.

RESULTS
functional screening of mirna target sites in ntrk3
the full-length and the truncated isoform of ntrk <dig> were searched for putative target sites with three widely used mirna target prediction programs - miranda, targetscan and pictar. taking into account the  <dig> human mirnas annotated in the mirbase database at the time of the analysis  we could identify  <dig> mirnas predicted to target the full-length isoform and  <dig> mirnas predicted to target the truncated isoform .

m, miranda; t, targetscan; p, pictar; np, not

sites and poorly conserved sites for mirna families broadly

¥, poorly conserved sites or poorly conserved mirna families. 

the number of predicted sites is indicated in brackets.

the entire 3'utrs of the full-length and truncated isoforms of ntrk <dig>  were cloned immediately downstream of the firefly luciferase open reading frame in the pgl <dig>  plasmid, and the resulting constructs were designated pgl <dig> -fl and pgl <dig> -tr. the renilla reporter plasmid pgl <dig>  was used to control for transfection efficiency. a total of  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> non-targeting controls were tested on both pgl <dig> -fl and pgl <dig> -tr. tested mirnas  included the  <dig> mentioned above;  <dig> additional mirnas that appeared in more recent versions of the mirbase database and had putative target sites in the truncated isoform  were also included because allelic variants were found in their target sites after re-sequencing of patients with anxiety disorders  <cit> . eleven out of the  <dig> mirnas were predicted to regulate the truncated isoform by more than one method, and at least  <dig> were conserved target sites for mirna families broadly conserved among vertebrates . finally,  <dig> mirnas with no predicted target sites according to the interrogated methods were also analyzed for comparison.

the specific luciferase activity of the pgl <dig> -fl construct was significantly decreased by  <dig> mirnas predicted to target the full-length isoform . the strongest repression was observed with mir- <dig> , followed by mir-151-3p . in the case of pgl <dig> -tr, the luciferase activity was significantly reduced by  <dig> mirnas , all of which were predicted by at least one program: mir- <dig>  mir-324-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-485-3p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-768-5p. the most conspicuous inhibition was detected with mir- <dig> , mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> , while the other five mirnas gave a reduction ranging between 13% and 30%.

since multiple target sites in the same 3'utr are thought to be cooperative and to increase the efficacy of mirna inhibition, we analyzed whether the cotransfection of different mirnas repressing pgl4-13-tr could lead to a synergistic effect and a more dramatic reduction in luciferase activity. thirteen combinations of two mirnas were tested, but we could not detect a significant decrease in luciferase expression compared with the corresponding mirnas taken individually; a combination of the three most effective mirnas - mir- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> - was also analyzed and no synergistic effect was observed .

mirna-mediated regulation of endogenous ntrk <dig> in neuroblastoma cells
sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells were used to investigate whether mirnas causing a significant decrease in luciferase activity were also able to downregulate endogenous ntrk <dig>  upon exposure to retinoic acid , sh-sy5y cells reduce their growth rate and differentiate by extending neurites into cells that are biochemically, ultrastructurally and electrophysiologically similar to neurons  <cit> . furthermore, ra treatment has been shown to induce the appearance of functional fl-ntrk <dig> receptors in this cell line  <cit> .

we characterized the expression of ntrk <dig> in sh-sy5y cells at different time points during ra exposure by western blotting. as previously described for another neuroblastoma cell line  <cit> , we could observe an increase in the levels of the full-length isoform and a decrease in the truncated isoform. full-length protein levels were ~ <dig> -fold higher after three days of ra treatment, ~4-fold higher after six days and reached up to ~8-fold after ten days. on the other hand, the expression of the truncated isoform was reduced by approximately 50% after three days of exposure, and kept decreasing very slightly through day  <dig> . given these expression profiles, untreated cells were used to study the regulation of the truncated isoform, and ra-differentiated cells were used for the full-length isoform.

the endogenous expression of  <dig> luciferase-validated mirnas was also analyzed in sh-sy5y cells, using custom oligonucleotide microarrays . the expression of these mirnas was in general very low, making mirna overexpression, rather than the use of mirna antagonists, the method of choice to analyze the regulation of endogenous ntrk <dig> in this cell system. luciferase-validated mirnas were therefore transfected into either undifferentiated  or differentiated sh-sy5y cells , and protein levels were assessed by western blotting  <dig> h after transfection. in agreement with the luciferase assay data, fl-ntrk <dig> levels were significantly reduced by mir-151-3p ; a slight inhibition was also observed with mir- <dig>  but did not reach statistical significance . to investigate whether such inhibition of fl-ntrk <dig> was able to affect the efficiency of nt3-induced signaling, we analyzed erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation by acutely stimulating transfected cells with nt <dig> after serum starvation. erk phosphorylation was used as a readout for the activation of the ras/mapk pathway, which is triggered by stimulation of full-length, kinase-active ntrk receptors  <cit> . we could detect a reduction in erk phosphorylation with mir-151-3p but not with mir- <dig> , which is consistent with the reduction observed in the levels of fl-ntrk <dig> after overexpression of mir-151-3p.

ra, retinoic acid. expression levels are indicated relative to background signal.

as for tr-ntrk <dig> , a significant downregulation, ranging between 20% and 30%, was observed with mir- <dig>  mir-485-3p, mir- <dig> and mir-768-5p; the strongest repression was caused by mir- <dig>  and mir-485-3p . three natural mutations occurring in the 3'utr of tr-ntrk <dig> had been previously identified, which fall within the predicted binding sites of these four mirnas  <cit> : ss <dig> at the binding sites for mir-768-5p  and mir- <dig> , rs <dig> at the binding site for mir-485-3p , and ss <dig> at the binding site for mir-768-5p . we generated pgl <dig> -tr point mutants that resemble these naturally occurring mutations and could observe a significant recovery of luciferase activity in mutant constructs , which supports the predicted direct mirna-mrna binding interactions. the remaining four mirnas  caused a slight reduction in the expression levels of the truncated isoform of ntrk <dig> , but none of them reached statistical significance. in the case of mir- <dig>  the mirna that caused the strongest reduction in tr-ntrk <dig> levels, we performed antisense experiments using lna mirna inhibitors. blocking endogenous mir- <dig>  we could observe a slight increase  in the levels of tr-ntrk <dig> compared with the control ; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance, probably due to the low basal expression of mir- <dig> in this cell system.

finally, full-length and truncated ntrk <dig> transcripts were quantified by real-time quantitative rt-pcr after mirna overexpression, using isoform-specific primers. mrna levels were not affected by any of the regulating mirnas, indicating that they do not act by destabilizing ntrk <dig> transcripts and suggesting that the observed downregulation is achieved through translational repression.

mir- <dig> overexpression affects the morphology and number of sh-sy5y cells
after transfection with mirna mimics, cells were examined under a phase-contrast microscope to check for possible alterations induced by mirna overexpression. while in most cases there were no appreciable differences, considerable changes were observed after transfection with mir- <dig> : cells acquired rounded bodies with shorter neurites, the overall cell size looked smaller than control cells and the culture confluence appeared to be higher, suggesting an increase in the total number of cells. given that mir- <dig> downregulates tr-ntrk <dig>  it was reasonable to speculate that the repression of this variant could be responsible for at least part of the observed effects. cells were therefore transfected with an sirna directed against tr-ntrk <dig>  which targets an isoform-specific sequence located within the 3'utr region and reduces tr-ntrk <dig> levels by approximately 25% - a degree of repression comparable to that observed with mir- <dig>  interestingly, the morphology of cells was similar to that described for mir- <dig> , supporting the hypothesis that tr-ntrk <dig> plays a part in the morphological phenotype. in order to characterize these changes, two-parameter forward/side scatter  flow cytometry was performed, revealing no shift in the population of cells transfected with mir- <dig> . this indicates that there is no variation in the actual size or cytoplasmic complexity of cells and that the observed alterations are due to other factors, possibly involving a modification of the adhesive properties or in the motility of the cell. finally, transfected cells were counted with a coulter cell counter, showing that the total number of cells in plates transfected with mir- <dig> was 27% higher than in control plates .

mir- <dig> is a brain-enriched mirna, whose expression has been shown to correlate and increase with neuronal differentiation  <cit> . the expression of mir- <dig> was analyzed by real-time quantitative rt-pcr in a set of human tissues  as well as in sh-sy5y cells at different stages of ra treatment. the analysis confirmed that mir- <dig> is strongly expressed in the brain, and high levels were also detected in skeletal muscle, followed by thymus and kidney . in sh-sy5y cells, in agreement with the mirna microarray experiment described before, mir- <dig> showed low levels of expression, with average crossing point  values ranging from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig>  nevertheless, we could indeed observe an increase in mir- <dig> expression upon ra treatment . this change in mir- <dig> levels, also observed by microarray analysis, is consistent with the hypothesis that it contributes to the repression of tr-ntrk <dig> during ra-mediated differentiation of sh-sy5y cells.

transcriptome analysis of sh-sy5y cells transfected with mir-128
in order to gain insight into the role of mir- <dig>  the effects of its overexpression were further analyzed using whole genome expression microarrays . considering a fold-change  cutoff of  <dig>  and a q-value < <dig>  we could identify a total of  <dig> deregulated genes after mir- <dig> overexpression in sh-sy5y cells -  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated - with a maximum fc of ~ <dig>  for upregulated genes and - <dig> for downregulated genes. the top ten upregulated and downregulated genes are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, among them are several genes implicated in apoptosis, cell death/survival and proliferation, with a general tendency for those leading to cell death to be downregulated and for those leading to survival to be upregulated. the most striking example is bcl <dig> , a well-known antiapoptotic gene that inhibits caspase activity. the upregulation of bcl <dig> in mir-128-transfected cells could explain the observed increase in cell number, which is consistent with enhanced apoptosis inhibition. also interesting is paip <dig> , a translational repressor that inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor , a potent mitogen and survival factor with neuroprotective functions in the brain. the deregulation of other genes like ngfrap <dig>  prss <dig>  traif3ip <dig>  creb3l <dig> and of the proapoptotic factors txnip  and dap <dig>  follows the same trend. other strongly deregulated genes are involved in vesicular transport, like dync1i <dig>  and in cytoskeletal organization like tmsb <dig>  trappc <dig> and vbp <dig> . this is in accordance with the observed morphological phenotype and with the involvement of tr-ntrk <dig> in membrane remodelling, actin reorganization and cell movement  <cit> .

the  <dig> genes deregulated upon mir- <dig> overexpression, with the corresponding expression values, were uploaded into the ingenuity pathway analysis software, and the program was interrogated about biological functions, canonical pathways and molecular networks that could be affected. we found associations with biological functions such as cell cycle, cancer, neurological disease and cell death  >3) and with metabolic canonical pathways  >3). enzymes implicated in these pathways show a marked predominance of downregulation over upregulation, indicating that metabolic processes may in general be inhibited or impaired in mir-128-transfected cells. interestingly, the molecular network showing the highest percentage of deregulated genes has bcl <dig> as one of its central nodes and is associated with cancer, gene expression and neurological disease .

finally, microarray results were compared to target predictions, in order to check whether any of the deregulated genes could potentially be direct targets of mir-128; such genes would undergo mirna-mediated regulation through mrna cleavage rather than translational repression. table  <dig> shows the intersection of the  <dig> genes deregulated by mir- <dig> overexpression  and the putative target genes predicted by targetscan. of  <dig> total predicted mir- <dig> targets,  <dig> were deregulated , a number that is higher than expected by chance  and indicates a significant enrichment for deregulated genes among predicted targets. as expectable, there was a huge predominance of downregulation over upregulation, with just one upregulated gene out of  <dig> 

overlapping between target predictions for mir- <dig>  and genes deregulated by its overexperession. *only one out of  <dig> deregulated and predicted target genes was upregulated

overexpression of mir- <dig> upregulates bcl2
bcl <dig> has no predicted target sites for mir- <dig> and, as previously mentioned, resulted to be upregulated upon mir- <dig> overexpression  in our microarray experiment. such upregulation was validated by western blotting, which showed an increase of approximately  <dig> -fold at the protein level  - similar to that observed by microarray for the transcript. the possible effect of the upregulation of bcl <dig> on the activation of apoptotic markers, such as caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  in cells transfected with mir- <dig> was also analyzed by western blotting. as shown in figure 9b, the active forms of both caspases are practically undetectable, indicating that the basal level of apoptosis in sh-sy5y cells is already low; as a consequence, it was not possible to appreciate any decrease in the activation of the two caspases. however, although better known as an antiapoptotic factor, bcl <dig> also plays a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, which appears to be at least in part separate from its antiapoptotic function. it has been shown that bcl <dig> has an antiproliferative effect, driving cells into enhanced g <dig> arrest. enhanced g <dig> could possibly explain the increase in cell number associated with mir- <dig> and is compatible with the general downregulation of metabolic pathways indicated by the microarray analysis. mtt assays performed on sh-sy5y cells revealed no change in total mitochondrial activity after transfection with mir- <dig>  despite the larger number of cells, again in agreement with a general reduction of metabolic activity, which is typical of the quiescent state.

discussion
in this study we explore how mirnas take part in the regulation of two isoforms of the neurotrophin- <dig> receptor ntrk <dig>  which present non-overlapping 3'utrs. we demonstrate that the two isoforms are targeted by different sets of mirnas, providing new evidence for a role of mirnas in determining the balance among different splice variants of a gene. in fact, we identify one mirnas regulating the full-length isoform of ntrk <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas regulating the truncated isoform .

our approach followed two steps: a first screening of mirnas with predicted targets in the 3'utr of either isoform, performed in hela cells using luciferase constructs, and a subsequent validation of the ability of luciferase-positive mirnas to repress endogenous ntrk <dig> receptors in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells. upon exposure to ra, sh-sy5y differentiate into cells that are similar to neurons  <cit> ; the presence of fl-ntrk <dig> receptors after ra stimulation had previously been demonstrated in this cell system  <cit> , where we could well characterize the expression of both ntrk <dig> isoforms.

if we compare the results obtained with the two strategies,  <dig> out of  <dig>  luciferase-positive mirnas were validated on endogenous ntrk <dig>  given that the constitutive expression of the remaining  <dig> mirnas is similarly low in both hela and sh-sy5y cells, we could rule out the possibility that high levels of endogenous mirnas in sh-sy5y cells affected the results of the validation, making the overexpression of mirna mimics less effective; such rate of false-positives is probably related with the artificial context in which the 3'utrs are inserted in the luciferase assay strategy.

one limitation of this study is that, due to the generally low expression levels of the analyzed mirnas in sh-sy5y cells, the experiments were based on mirna overexpression, rather than inhibition of endogenous mirnas. it would be certainly interesting to analyze the effect of mirna inhibition in a different cell system where the mirnas of interest are highly expressed, including cell lines where ntrk <dig> is not present and where the inhibition of the regulating mirnas might indeed induce its expression. in addition, the levels of the truncated isoform of ntrk <dig> were also low in sh-sy5y, and standard wb quantification by enhanced chemiluminescence detection proved to be not enough sensitive. we therefore used fluorescent detection, employing fluorescently-labelled secondary antibodies and an infrared imaging system, which allows the precise quantification of low-abundance proteins  <cit> , and has the advantage that the signal generated by the proteins on the membrane is measured in a static state, as opposed to the enzymatic reaction of chemiluminescence, which is dynamic and changes over time  <cit> . given that the signal with this detection system is linear and not exponential as in chemiluminescence, the differences between bands are less apparent but the quantification by densitometry becomes much more accurate. this allowed us to detect the subtle changes originated by the overexpression of mirnas.

interestingly, mir-151-3p and mir- <dig> have partially overlapping target sequences in the full-length isoform and, in a similar way, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-768-5p target the same segment of the 3'utr of the truncated isoform . it is worth of notice that while both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> cause a strong reduction in luciferase activity , only mir- <dig> seems to repress the corresponding protein isoform in sh-sy5y cells. intriguingly, mir- <dig> is expressed in brain, whereas mir- <dig> is not present in brain but shows a strong expression in kidney and testis. this suggests that the binding of these mirnas to their target sequences might be mutually exclusive, and that the regulation of ntrk <dig> by mirnas could be coordinated in a tissue specific fashion.

the second part of this study focused on mir- <dig>  one of the mirnas repressing the truncated isoform. mir- <dig> is a brain-enriched mirna, whose expression has been shown to positively correlate with neuronal differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, accumulation of mir- <dig> has been detected in the hippocampus of alzheimer's disease brains  <cit> . here, we show that the overexpression of mir- <dig> causes morphological changes in sh-sy5y cells, which resemble those observed using an sirna specifically directed against tr-ntrk <dig>  in accordance with the morphological changes, as revealed by microarray analysis, mir- <dig> alters the expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal organization, a process with which the truncated isoform has been related. these results suggest an involvement of mir- <dig> in the organization of the cytoskeleton through the regulation of ntrk <dig>  possibly in cooperation with other mir- <dig> targets.

another consequence of the overexpression of mir- <dig> in sh-sy5y cells is an increase in cell number, which is accompanied by the deregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, cell death/survival and proliferation, with a remarkable upregulation of bcl <dig>  bcl <dig> codes for an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks cytochrome c release from mitochondria and inhibits caspase activity, suppressing apoptosis. however, the analysis of caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> activation revealed that in normal culture conditions there is virtually no apoptosis in sh-sy5y cells, making the hypothesis of an increased inhibition of this process unsuitable for our results. it would be therefore interesting to analyze the effects of mir- <dig> in the presence of apoptosis-promoting agents.

besides apoptosis, bcl <dig> also plays a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, having an antiproliferative effect that drives cells into enhanced g <dig> arrest. this is thought to promote cell survival, especially in unfavorable environments, since quiescent cells are more resistant to killing than proliferating cells  <cit> . although this could be could be compatible with the increase in cell number and with the general reduction of metabolic activity observed in our analyses, further investigation is needed to support this hypothesis and to exhaustively evaluate the contribution of bcl <dig> to the observed phenotype, as well as that of other proliferation-regulating genes whose expression is altered by mir- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the full-length and truncated isoforms of ntrk <dig> are regulated by different sets of mirnas, demonstrating that the regulation of ntrk <dig> by micrornas is isoform-specific and indicating that neurotrophin-mediated processes are strongly linked to microrna-dependent mechanisms. in addition, overexpression of the brain-enriched mirna mir- <dig> - one of the mirnas that regulates the truncated isoform of ntrk <dig> - causes morphological changes in neuroblastoma cells and alters the expression profile of genes involved in cytoskeletal organization, apoptosis and cell proliferation, including the anti-apoptotic factor bcl <dig>  these findings open new perspectives for the study of the physiological role of mir- <dig> and its possible involvement in cell death/survival processes.
