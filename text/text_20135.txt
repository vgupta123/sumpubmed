BACKGROUND
exudative epidermitis occurs as a generalized or localized skin disease of young pigs. the disease is common, can result in high morbidity and if severe can cause high death losses  <cit> . resistance to β-lactam antimicrobials among staphylococci isolated from pigs is common  <cit> , but few studies have been conducted to examine this topic, apart from relatively recent studies that have evaluated the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  colonization in healthy pigs. public health concerns associated with mrsa in pigs have generated a great deal of interest, and numerous studies have documented the widespread prevalence of mrsa among the world pig population  <cit> . however, s. aureus has only minor significance as a swine pathogen, whereas other staphylococci such as staphylococcus hyicus can result in economically important disease such as exudative epidermitis  <cit> . previous studies by our group have identified that treatment failure in cases of exudative epidermitis in pigs is common, partly due to the widespread presence of multi-drug resistance in staphylococci  <cit> . resistance against the β-lactam family of antibiotics including penicillin g, ampicillin and cephalosporins was particularly noteworthy because penicillin is typically the drug of choice in the treatment of exudative epidermitis, almost exclusively in the absence of culture and susceptibility testing  <cit> .

acquired resistance to β-lactams is mediated through two main mechanisms, β-lactamase production or altered penicillin binding protein  production. bacterial β-lactamases hydrolyze the β-lactam ring and in staphylococci typically confer resistance to penicillins . inhibitors of β-lactamase  can inhibit this resistance mechanism and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are widely used in some species, but not in the swine industry  <cit> . in contrast, altered pbp2a production encoded by meca, results in low affinity for all β-lactams and confers broad resistance to β-lactams  that is not affected by β-lactamase inhibitors.

despite the importance of s. hyicus in swine disease, the commonness of β-lactam use to treat staphylococcal infections, and clinical evidence indicating poor response of exudative epidermitis to β-lactams in some situations  <cit> , there has been minimal investigation of β-lactam antimicrobial resistance in this species. the primary objective of this research was to investigate and characterize β-lactam resistance in s. hyicus, s. aureus and other staphylococci isolated from pigs affected with exudative epidermitis.

methods
source of staphylococci isolates
staphylococcal isolates were obtained from a previous trial  <cit> . briefly, researchers visited  <dig> farms with endemic exudative epidermitis, taking skin and nasal swabs of pigs  with clinical signs of exudative epidermitis. one hundred and forty-four s. hyicus and  <dig> s. aureus isolates from skin samples were identified by the animal health laboratory , university of guelph, ontario with standard laboratory techniques including colony morphology, haemolysis, gram stain, catalase reaction and coagulase reaction. antimicrobial susceptibility testing for penicillin g , ampicillin  and ceftiofur  were performed by disk diffusion  as per clinical and laboratory standard institution  guidelines  <cit>  by ahl. there were  <dig> %  of s. hyicus isolates and 76%  of s. aureus isolates concurrently resistant to penicillin g, ampicillin and ceftiofur. additionally,  <dig> mrsa isolates were recovered from nasal swabs. nasal swabs were placed in enrichment broth and incubated for a day and then inoculated onto mrsa chromogenic agar  and incubated aerobically for 24- <dig> h. isolates were identified as s. aureus by gram stain, catalase test, tube coagulase test and the s. aureus latex agglutination assay . staphylococcal isolates that were resistant to penicillin g, ampicillin, or ceftiofur from skin samples and mrsa from nasal swabs were included in this study.

staphylococcus speciation
methicillin-resistant staphylococci that were presumed to be s. hyicus based on standard phenotypic identification were confirmed by s. hyicus pcr  <cit> , soda sequencing, or matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization – time of flight  ms analysis by a micro flex lt mass spectrometer  using the maldi biotyper software package with the reference database v. <dig>  by ahl.

methicillin resistance
methicillin-resistance was evaluated by meca pcr or detection of pbp2a by latex agglutination test  . amplification of meca dna with the primers 5’-gtt gta gtt gtc ggg ttt gg-3’ and 5’ctt cca cat acc atc ttc ttt aac-3’, using previously described conditions  <cit>  was performed. isolates that were meca-negative but resistant to ceftiofur were also tested for the novel mec homologue mecc using a multiplex pcr  <cit> . the primers for mecc were 5’-gaa aaa aag gct tag aac gcc tc- 3’ and 5’-gaa gat ctt ttc cgt ttt cag c-3’. all amplifications were performed on supernatants from crude dna extracts which were prepared and purified with instagene™ matrix . products of pcr were electrophoresed through  <dig> % agarose gels and visualized through gelred nucleic acid stain .

spa typing
thirty-nine mrsa isolates of  <dig> total mrsa isolates were selected to type the staphylococcal protein a gene   <cit> .

sccmec typing
all methicillin-resistant isolates were further characterized based on sccmec elements using multiplex pcrs  for typing of the mec complex class a and b, and the ccr complex type  <dig>  type  <dig>  and type  <dig> , for typing of ccr complex type  <dig> , for typing the mec complex class c , and for typing the ccr complex type  <dig> . the primer pairs used for m-pcr  <dig> and m-pcr  <dig> were referred from zhang et al.  <cit>  and the primer pairs used for m-pcr  <dig> and m-pcr  <dig> were referred from kondo et al.  <cit> .

effect of β-lactamase inhibitors
staphylococcal skin isolates that were resistant to penicillin g, ampicillin and ceftiofur but meca gene negative were tested for susceptibility to oxacillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid by disk diffusion  <cit> . synergy between oxacillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was detected by a double-disk diffusion test where a disk of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid  and a disk of oxacillin  were placed 15mm apart  on an inoculated agar plate. a clear extension of the edge of the oxacillin inhibition zone toward the disk containing clavulanic acid was interpreted as synergy, indicating the presence of a β-lactamase  <cit> .

RESULTS
a flow chart describing the testing and the results is presented in figure  <dig>  one hundred forty-four presumed s. hyicus and  <dig> s. aureus isolates from skin swabs were further tested. the meca was identified in  <dig> s. aureus skin isolates and  <dig> presumed s. hyicus skin isolates. thirty-one  of the presumptive s. hyicus isolates were reconfirmed as s. hyicus ,  <dig> were methicillin-resistant s. chromogenes ,  <dig> were methicillin-resistant s. pseudintermedius  and one each of s. arlettae and s. cohnii subsp. urealyticus. the thirty nasal isolates had been previously confirmed as mrsa. the characteristics of these methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolates are overviewed in table  <dig>

the overall prevalence of methicillin resistance on farms was found to be 50% , 20% , and  <dig> %  for mrsh, mrsa , and mrsa , respectively. twenty farms out of  <dig> farms had methicillin-resistant staphylococci from either the skin or nasal samples. five farms had pigs harbouring both mrsa  and mrsh, and  <dig> farms had pigs harbouring both mrsa  and methicillin- resistant non- s. aureus staphylococci . seven spa types were detected from  <dig> mrsa isolates. the spa type t <dig> , a common st <dig> strain, was predominant . the st398-associated t <dig> and t <dig> were found in single pigs and spa types t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> were also found once each.

the majority of sccmec types in methicillin-resistant staphylococci in the study were sccmec type v  , with sccmec type v accounting for  <dig> % of mrsa  and  <dig> % of mrsh  isolates. seventeen isolates only yielded results for mec gene complex class a or class c, or ccr gene complex type  <dig>  three mrsh had any neither mec gene complex nor ccr gene complex, and so sccmec typing was repeated for these non- typeable isolates. multiple isolates with the same incomplete sccmec typing results were found on  <dig> farms. while  <dig> different staphylococcal species possessing the same complete sccmec type were found on  <dig> farms. three pigs were found to harbour both mrsh and mrsa  in the same sccmec type v. one pig had harboured both mrsh and mrsa , both of which harboured mec gene complex class c. four other pigs harboured both mrsa and other methicillin-resistant staphylococci , and they possessed sccmec typev or ccr gene complex type  <dig>

sixty-seven isolates of s. hyicus were meca negative but resistant to  <dig> β-lactam antimicrobials . sixty-two  were susceptible to both oxacillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, while  <dig>  were resistant to oxacillin but susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and  <dig>  were susceptible to oxacillin but resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. further, the  <dig> oxacillin-resistant, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid susceptible isolates did not show an alteration of the zone of inhibition in the double disk test. these  <dig> s. hyicus isolates tested negative for mecc.

fifty-five isolates of s. aureus were meca negative but resistant to the penicillin g, ampicillin and ceftiofur. twenty-six  of these were susceptible to both oxacillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and  <dig>  isolates were resistant to oxacillin but susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic. twenty-one isolates  were resistant to both oxacillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid but, when the double disk test was used, alteration of the zone of inhibition was apparent for  <dig>  isolates; suggesting oxacillin resistance was mediated through excessive β-lactamase production. these  <dig> s. aureus isolates were mecc negative.

discussion
there has been considerable work done to examine the prevalence of mrsa in the pig population  <cit>  and its association with human infection because of the potential public health risk  <cit> . mrsa is presumed to have acquired meca from coagulase negative staphylococci  <cit> , and methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci are common commensals  <cit> . methicillin-resistance has emerged, presumably in a similar manner, in other pathogenic staphylococci. therefore, it is reasonable to consider that transmission of meca between s. aureus and s. hyicus, in either direction, might occur on pig farms where both staphylococcal species are present, particularly in the presence of regular therapeutic or prophylactic use of β-lactam antimicrobials.

the finding of meca in s. hyicus is important for a number of reasons. from a swine health standpoint, it is of relevance because of resistance to penicillin and ceftiofur, two commonly used antimicrobials  <cit> . from a public health standpoint the finding that mrsa and mrsh can carry the same sccmec raises the concern that the genetic material conferring multiple antimicrobial resistance may be passing from species to species within the bacterial population of a farm, and raises questions about whether mrsh could ultimately be a source for further emergence of mrsa clones on pig farms. finding the same sccmec does not indicate whether meca was transmitted from s. aureus to s. hyicus, from s. hyicus to s. aureus or to both s. hyicus and s. aureus from another source. further study of transmission of meca between different staphylococci at the pig or farm level is warranted. thus, while s. hyicus is of little zoonotic relevance, the public health relevance of mrsh cannot be completely dismissed.

sccmec type was not determined for  <dig> % of mrsh,  <dig> % of mrsc, and 50% of mrsp because the primers that were used were unable to detect either the mec or ccr complexes , only detecting the mec complex  or only detecting the ccr complex . this is not unexpected since there has been limited investigation other than in mrsa. sccmec types other than those evaluated here are described and it is possible that further testing would have clarified the sccmec type in the isolates in the present study. however, even with testing for all described sccmec types, some isolates may remain untypable  <cit>  and it was determined that additional typing would have contributed little to fulfilling the main objectives of this study.

one curious finding here was the presence of isolates that were resistant to β-lactams and β-lactam/ β-lactam inhibitor combinations but meca negative. to the authors’ knowledge, the only known mechanism for ceftiofur and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance in staphylococci is methicillin resistance, and this suggests that a different mec element that is not detectable by conventional meca pcr or pbp2a lat could be involved. one recent example of this is mecc  which has been identified in animals and humans in europe  <cit> . however, this mecc gene was not detected. this does not exclude the possibility that a different novel mec element was present. it is noteworthy that double disk diffusion testing indicated an impact of clavulanic acid on oxacillin resistance, suggesting that hyperproduction of β-lactamase might be the cause of the resistance for some  meca negative β-lactam resistant s. aureus isolates.

CONCLUSIONS
methicillin resistance can be identified in a variety of staphylococcal species isolated from pigs. in this study there was a great deal of similarity in the sccmec types between staphylococcal species, suggesting that resistance may be passed from one species of staphylococci to another species of staphylococci. while this has been reported for acquisition of methicillin-resistant from coagulase negative staphylococci to s. aureus, these data suggest that transmission to or from the porcine pathogen s. hyicus may also occur. the identification of methicillin resistance in a variety of staphylococcal species in pigs does raise concerns about the spread of serious multi-drug resistance in food producing animals and warrants further study.
