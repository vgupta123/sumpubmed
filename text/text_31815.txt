BACKGROUND
the protein secretory pathway is an important area of fungal research, as the secretion of proteins by fungal cells is of major biological and commercial significance. ashbya gossypii , a well known industrial producer of riboflavin  <cit> , is a filamentous fungus that has been recently considered as a host for the production of recombinant proteins  <cit> . however, its protein secretory pathway and the spectrum of proteins natively secreted by this fungus to the extracellular space remain virtually unexplored. a. gossypii has one of the smallest eukaryotic genomes known  <cit>  and is phylogenetically closer to yeast than to other filamentous fungi  <cit> , sharing a high degree of gene homology and gene order conservation with the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae
 <cit> . although efficient protein secretion is generally associated with filamentous growth, the secretion levels of the heterologous proteins endoglucanase i  and cellobiohydrolase i  from trichoderma reesei in a. gossypii were previously reported to be low  <cit> . the production of heterologous proteins by fungal species is usually much less efficient than the production of native proteins and several steps in the secretory pathway  are potential bottlenecks for heterologous protein production .

in eukaryotes, newly synthesised proteins are typically targeted for entry into the general secretory pathway by the presence of a n-terminal signal sequence that typically has a length between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and comprises a central hydrophobic region flanked by hydrophilic n- and c- terminal regions  <cit> . taking advantage of the characteristics of these signal peptides and other sorting signals, several computational tools have been developed to predict the subcellular location of proteins such as the extracellular space . these have been used for the genome-wide prediction of putative fungal secretomes  <cit> . as the translocation of proteins into the endoplasmatic reticulum  is determined by the secretion signal, the correct processing of signal peptides, together with the proper folding of proteins within the er, is important in recombinant protein production and secretion  <cit> .

the er serves as the first station of the secretory pathway. its lumen provides a unique oxidizing environment in which highly active folding machinery, including molecular chaperones and foldases, facilitates and promotes the folding, assembling, modification and maturation of proteins. to ensure that only properly folded proteins move onward through the secretory pathway, the er also contains stringent quality control mechanisms that retain malfolded  proteins and ultimately retrotranslocate them into the cytosol for proteasomal degradation through a process called er-associated degradation  . environmental and physiological demands  can lead to an imbalance between the protein folding load and the protein folding capacity in the er lumen, resulting in an accumulation of malfolded proteins, i.e. er stress . in response to er stress, eukaryotic cells have evolved signalling pathways that induce the unfolded protein response . the upr activates a gene expression program that helps to restore homeostasis in the er by enhancing er protein folding capacity and erad, and reducing translation and entry of new proteins into the er .

cellular responses to the accumulation of malfolded proteins in the er have been described for yeast, filamentous fungi and higher eukaryotes, and shown to play a significant role in the stress response to production of secreted recombinant proteins  <cit> . the inositol-requiring enzyme  <dig>  gene encodes the protein that controls the most conserved and best understood upr signalling pathway in lower eukaryotes  <cit> . ire1p has a luminal sensing domain coupled to cytosolic kinase and endoribonuclease  domains  <cit> . the accumulation of malfolded proteins in the er lumen leads to the oligomerization of the ire1p luminal domain and thereby to the activation of its kinase and rnase functions  <cit> .

upon ire1p activation, the ire1p rnase initiates the splicing of a non-conventional intron from hac <dig> messenger rna , thus allowing the translation of active hac1p, a basic-leucine zipper  transcription factor that specifically binds to upr elements  in the promoter region of upr target genes, thereby up-regulating their transcription  <cit> . in response to strong er stress, ire1p signaling may also cause regulated ire1-dependent mrna decay  to reduce the er load by inducing the degradation of mrnas encoding secretory proteins  <cit> . several upr target genes have been identified, among which are those encoding er chaperones and protein folding enzymes, er structural and transport proteins, members of the erad machinery and components that mediate autophagy . the bzip transcription factor gcn4p, a major controller of the amino acid starvation response, has been shown to also play an essential role in the induction of a large subset of these target genes during er stress, by directly interacting with hac1p and modulating its activity in an ire1-independent way  <cit> .

the characterization of protein secretory pathway components and of the regulatory range of secretion stress responses in yeast and filamentous fungi has often relied on inducing er stress with chemical secretion blockers such as the folding inhibitor dithiothreitol , the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin and the protein trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a. in the present study, we analysed the events taking place at the transcription level in a. gossypii under recombinant protein secretion conditions and also under dtt-induced secretion stress, in order to identify bottlenecks that may hamper protein secretion in a. gossypii. moreover, to explore the native proteins putatively secreted by this fungus, we also analysed its predicted secretome by combining comparative in silico predictions for classically secreted proteins with experimental data derived from two-dimensional  gel electrophoresis.

RESULTS
the a. gossypiisecretome
the a. gossypii secretome was predicted from an analysis of its genomic data, using a computational pipeline  to detect known cellular sorting and localization signals in its putative proteins. of the  <dig>  open reading frames  annotated in the a. gossypii genome,  <dig>  were predicted to encode proteins containing a n-terminal signal peptide , and thus to enter the general secretory pathway. however, only  <dig> proteins  were predicted to be secreted extracellularly by the computational pipeline used , the others being targeted to different cellular compartments . all of the  <dig> proteins in the a. gossypii predicted secretome have homologs in closely related saccharomycotina species, but  <dig> have no homologs in s. cerevisiae. 67% were predicted to contain at least one n-glycosylation site . enzymes predicted to have hydrolytic activity comprised 33% of the a. gossypii predicted secretome .

growth and protein secretion by a. gossypii
a. gossypii atcc  <dig> produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l dry biomass in defined minimal medium  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l in rich medium  with sucrose as primary carbon source. at the beginning of the stationary phase the supernatant of the culture growing in minimal medium contained a total protein content of 130 mg/l and that of the culture growing in complex medium contained 218 mg/l.

sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  showed  <dig> distinct protein bands in the culture supernatant of both dmm and afm cultures, ranging from 7 kda to 209 kda . on 2-d gels,  <dig> protein spots were visible at higher abundance in the culture supernatants and were common to both dmm and afm cultures . of these, at least  <dig> were obviously isoforms of other protein spots with identical molecular weight but different isoelectric points . as shown in figures 1a and c more protein spots were detected in afm  than in dmm  culture supernatants. in addition, the distribution of the protein spots on the 2-d gels indicated that most of the a. gossypii secreted proteins have isoelectric points between  <dig> and  <dig>  and molecular weights above 25 kda, although some proteins present only in afm cultures did have slightly higher isoelectric points .figure  <dig>

effect of dtt on the a. gossypiigrowth
in order to study the effects of secretion stress on a. gossypii growth and gene transcription, duplicate bioreactor batch cultivations were carried out with a recombinant egi producing strain , its corresponding empty vector control strain, and the egi producing strain treated with a well known secretion stress inducer, dtt . as previously described  <cit> , the production of egi alone did not alter cellular growth. conversely, the addition of 10 mm final concentration dtt to cultures after  <dig>  h caused a substantial and immediate reduction in the specific growth rate of the a. gossypii egi producing cells . when the same concentration of dtt was added after only 6 h, the a. gossypii cells immediately stopped growing .figure  <dig>

effect of recombinant protein secretion on the a. gossypiitranscriptome
the overall variation in the microarray gene expression profiles between a. gossypii cells secreting recombinant egi and those which did not was very small. limma  could not detect significant differences between gene expression of the egi secreting and the empty vector control strains at any time. however, in order to directly study the link between egi secretion and gene expression, the correlation of each gene’s expression to egi secretion in egi producing cultivations was calculated. as the correlation analysis included the variation in replicates of single samples , it was expected to be more sensitive than limma. twenty-one genes were found to be differentially expressed  using the correlation approach, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in the strain secreting recombinant protein . gene ontology  enrichment analyses for this set of genes hinted at translation down-regulation and ion and amino acid transmembrane transport up-regulation having occurred during egi secretion.table  <dig>

effect of dtt-induced stress on the a. gossypiitranscriptiome
upon addition of dtt to cultures of a. gossypii egi producing cells during logarithmic growth, the gene expression profile changed significantly , as did the growth rate . when comparing the transcript levels of all genes at the time immediately before the addition of dtt  with those at 30 min, 1 h and 4 h after dtt addition,  <dig> genes were already up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated after 30 min of exposure to dtt . the up-regulation of  <dig> of these genes was sustained up to 4 h of treatment , and the same was observed for  <dig> of the  <dig> down-regulated genes . as can be seen from figure 3c, dtt induced more genes than it repressed. however, down-regulation was greater than up-regulation after 30 min and 1 h of dtt treatment, as higher fold changes were observed in the transcript levels of down-regulated than up-regulated genes .figure  <dig>

dtt caused wide-ranging effects on a. gossypii gene expression profiles . some of the changes probably correlate with the observed reduction in growth rate . for instance, within 30 min, the transcription of genes involved in filamentous growth , glycosylation and lipoprotein biosynthesis , and cell wall biosynthesis was already down-regulated by dtt. a down-regulation of ribosomal protein-encoding genes has been correlated with reductions in growth rate of s. cerevisiae
 <cit>  and analysis of the co-expression clusters revealed that genes encoding ribosomal proteins were also down-regulated in dtt treated a. gossypii cells compared to the control, particularly after 1 h of exposure to dtt .table  <dig>

treatment of a. gossypii cells with dtt led to major repression of the protein glycosylation pathway  . the observed repression was not only at the er, but also at the golgi processing level , indicating that a major accumulation of unglycosylated proteins may have occurred. genes involved in response to stress, transcription, protein unfolding, proteasome assembly, proteolysis, vesicle trafficking, vacuolar protein sorting, secretion, trehalose biosynthesis and dna repair were induced by dtt . however, the expression levels of classical upr targets such as ire <dig>  kar <dig>  hac <dig>  pdi <dig> and eug <dig> homologs were not altered in a. gossypii cells treated with 10 mm dtt, as confirmed by quantitative pcr  . moreover, the a. gossypii ero <dig> and lhs <dig> homologs, two other classical upr targets, were transcriptionally down-regulated in a. gossypii , as was the gcn <dig> homolog, which has been previously shown to be induced by er stress in other fungi  <cit> .

a search for common regulatory dna motifs in the promoter region of the dtt-regulated genes identified only  <dig> motifs that were common within one or more gene clusters , none of which matched known consensus binding sites for the transcriptional factors hac1p or gcn4p. among the common promoter elements found,  <dig> were similar to known binding sequences for the s. cerevisiae transcription factors rap1p, adr1p and hcm1p. the binding site for rap1p, a positive transcriptional regulator for multiple growth related genes such as ribosomal protein genes  <cit> , was over-represented in the dtt-induced gene cluster . the consensus sequence for adr1p binding was the only motif over-represented in the a. gossypii dtt down-regulated genes. adr1p is a carbon source responsive zinc-finger transcription factor that is required for transcription of the glucose-repressed gene adh <dig>  of peroxisomal protein genes and of genes required for ethanol, glycerol, and fatty acid utilization  <cit> . another had similarity to a ribosomal rna processing element , to which the s. cerevisiae stb3p has been demonstrated to bind  <cit>  and that was identified by gasch et al.  <cit>  as being a common element found in the promoter region of several genes repressed during environmental stress response . this motif was over-represented in the cluster of a. gossypii genes induced by dtt  and also in the co-expression clusters  <dig> and  <dig> , which are enriched in various functions associated with the rna metabolism.figure  <dig>

the expression of several genes involved in protein folding was significantly induced by dtt after 4 h of exposure, including jem <dig>  sil <dig>  ssa <dig>  sti <dig>  sis <dig>  fes <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsc <dig>  hsp <dig>  aha <dig>  mdj <dig>  hsp <dig>  apj <dig> and hsp <dig> homologs . some genes involved in the erad  and proteasome degradation  were also significantly induced by dtt within 1 h of treatment. up-regulation of vacuolar protein sorting  and vesicle trafficking was observed in the dtt-treated cells .

as mentioned above, dtt strongly and rapidly repressed the protein glycosylation pathway in a. gossypii . the a. gossypii yos <dig> and htm1/mnl <dig> homologs, which in s. cerevisiae encode two proteins that are required for the erad of misfolded glycoproteins  <cit> , were also repressed by dtt. several genes involved in the copi retrograde transport of proteins from the golgi back to the er were induced by dtt within 1 h of exposure , which might have favoured the recycling of proteins. some genes involved in the er to golgi protein trafficking were also induced by dtt, but copii vesicle-mediated transport was strongly repressed by dtt .

genes involved in translation were down-regulated by dtt, but only after 4 h of treatment . dtt also repressed the transcription of the a. gossypii ssh <dig> homolog, which in s. cerevisiae is involved in the co-translational translocation of proteins into the er  <cit> . on the other hand, genes involved in mrna degradation, such as dom <dig>  kem <dig>  ski <dig>  ski <dig>  ski <dig>  lsm <dig> and nmd <dig> homologs, were up-regulated by dtt within 1 h of treatment.

thirty percent of the genes whose transcription was significantly decreased 30 min after dtt addition  were predicted to encode secretory proteins . this decreased to 15% after 1 h and to 10% after 4 h of treatment. less than 5% of the significantly up-regulated genes were predicted to encode secretory proteins.

discussion
the secretion of proteins by filamentous fungi is important for hyphal extension, degradation of substrates in natural ecosystems and pathogenicity  <cit> . thus, many filamentous fungi have evolved to secrete high amounts of proteins. previous observations have suggested that the secretion abilities of a. gossypii were more similar to those of closely related yeast species than to those of other filamentous fungi  <cit> . here, we observed that the total protein concentration in the supernatants of a. gossypii submerged cultures with sucrose as primary carbon source was indeed relatively low . in silico analysis of the a. gossypii secretome predicted that it should represent around 1% of the total proteome, a percentage closer to that predicted for yeast secretomes   than to that predicted for the secretomes of filamentous fungi   <cit> . however, in 2-d electrophoresis gel maps, 157– <dig> protein spots  could be detected in the supernatants of a. gossypii cultures, indicating that, although in low amount, this fungus secreted a variety of proteins through the plasma membrane, possibly more than computationally predicted.

the existence of different isoforms of the same proteins  may have contributed to the higher number of protein spots observed in 2-d gels  than that computationally predicted . moreover, not all proteins require secretion signals to get out of a cell. several fungal species have been reported to secrete large amounts of proteins that lack the typical secretion signals of conventionally secreted proteins, via alternative vesicular pathways . thus, some protein spots may correspond to proteins secreted via an alternative secretory pathway, which would fail to be predicted as secreted by the computational tools used. the possible contribution of intracellular proteins for some of the weakest spots detected can also not be ruled out. nevertheless, the results from both experimental and computational analyses indicated that 1-4% of a. gossypii proteins are secreted.

of the  <dig> proteins that were predicted to comprise the a. gossypii secretome, less than 33% were putative enzymes with hydrolytic activity. this is in line with the limited range of carbon sources which a. gossypii utilises  <cit> . extracellular lipase  <cit> , amylase  <cit>  and β-glucosidase  <cit>  activities have previously been found in a. gossypii culture supernatants. in agreement with these observations, one putative lipase  and two putative β-glucosidases  were predicted to be secreted by a. gossypii. however, neither of the putative a. gossypii amylases  were predicted to contain a n-terminal signal peptide and, thus, would not be expected to be secreted via the general secretory pathway.

although extracellular protease activity in a. gossypii supernatants has been reported as negligible  <cit> , nine putative proteases  were predicted to be secreted, the majority of which would probably be most active at acidic ph  <cit> . given that the optimum ph range for a. gossypii is 6– <dig>  <cit>  and that only low concentrations of proteins are secreted by this fungus, extracellular protease activity would indeed be expected to be low or undetectable. an invertase  was also predicted to be secreted by this fungus and subsequent experimental characterization of this protein confirmed its function and secretion into the culture supernatant  <cit> . additionally, there was a putative acid phosphatase, a putative ureohydrolase and two putative fmn-binding proteins with probable oxidoreductase activity among the predicted secretome proteins, with no homologs in s. cerevisiae, but having homologs in kluyveromyces lactis. well-known extracellular proteins like α-factor mating pheromones  were also predicted to be secreted.

the fact that a. gossypii secretes a rather small number of proteins, together with the low concentration in which they are produced and the negligible extracellular protease activity could be advantageous in heterologous protein production if high secretion levels of recombinant proteins are achieved, since secreted products would be unlikely to be contaminated or degraded by the native proteins . moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the a. gossypii native secreted proteins could be used to facilitate product purification and quality control.

despite these advantages, a major drawback of using a. gossypii for heterologous protein production is its low productivity  <cit> . since egli expression levels were much lower than those of the highly expressed tef gene  <cit> , we conclude that egli was not highly overexpressed in the egi producing cells and that a stronger promoter and/or better expression strategies would contribute to improving production and secretion of recombinant proteins by a. gossypii. indeed, modifying the expression vector resulted in a  <dig> fold increase in extracellular egi activity  <cit> , while use of the a. gossipii native tef promoter substantially improved production of recombinant β-galactosidase from aspergillus niger, leading to relatively high levels of secretion  <cit> . enhancement of the protein translation efficiency could also increase the production of secreted proteins, as indicated by the down-regulation of some genes involved in regulation of protein translation during egi secretion.

previous studies have shown that secretion of recombinant proteins can lead to secretion stress and trigger the upr, which modulates both general and protein-specific transcriptional responses  <cit> . this did not occur in a. gossypii, probably because egl <dig> was not highly expressed and thus egi production did not constitute a major burden to the cells. carvalho et al.  <cit>  recently shown that, in a. niger, the induction of the upr pathway is dependent on the level of heterologous gene expression. under relative low-expressing conditions, the basal protein folding and quality control machinery of the a. niger er was adequate, but under high-expressing conditions er stress was induced  <cit> .

we induced secretion stress in a. gossypii cells with dtt, since it was not induced by egi production. dtt has been widely used to induce secretion stress in investigations of the upr , even though it is not a specific secretion stress inducer, inducing other stresses, such as oxidative stress, as well. transcription of genes that may not be closely related to the upr is also affected, as observed in a transcriptomic comparison of aspergillus nidulans cells stressed by dtt treatment or by recombinant chymosin secretion, which showed similar changes in the expression of some genes, but not others  <cit> . however, dtt has consistently induced the upr in various yeast and filamentous fungi .

dtt did not trigger a conventional upr in a. gossypii, as the expression levels of several well-known upr target genes  remained unchanged and no upre-like motif was overrepresented in the gene clusters up-regulated by dtt. the amount of dtt used in this study  was comparable to that used in several other studies with yeast and filamentous fungi  . to our knowledge, only in studies of a. nidulans and a. niger has dtt been added to the cultures at a higher concentration   <cit> .

although a classical upr was not induced, there was evidence of secretion stress induced by dtt in a. gossypii cells . expression of several genes involved in protein unfolding, erad, proteasome degradation, proteolysis, vesicle trafficking, vacuolar protein sorting and secretion significantly increased within 1 h of dtt treatment. in fungi, the upr was thought to be exclusively dependent on ire1p-mediated splicing of hac <dig> mrna. however, an ire1-, hac1- and upre-independent pathway for transcriptional activation upon er stress exists in s. cerevisiae, which may activate a core promoter through stimulation of rna polymerase ii holoenzyme activity  <cit> . miyazaki et al.  <cit>  have also demonstrated that candida glabrata has lost the classic ire1p-hac1p upr, but instead possesses an alternative mechanism, ridd. in a. gossypii, the expression of several genes involved in mrna degradation was induced by dtt, which suggests that a ridd-like mechanism may exist in a. gossypii to reduce the er load when there is secretion stress. another mechanism to alleviate the load of proteins in the er in some fungi is the transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding secreted proteins in response to secretion stress . this down-regulation mechanism has been described in t. reesei
 <cit> , a. niger
 <cit>  and s. cereviaise
 <cit> . in a. gossypii, dtt also repressed the transcription of a large number of genes encoding putative secretory proteins.figure  <dig>

two of the genes, encoding a subunit of the translocon complex  and a chaperone involved in the translocation of newly synthesised proteins into the er , which were repressed by dtt may have contributed to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the cytosol. intriguingly, most of the genes involved in protein folding that were up-regulated by dtt encoded cytosolic chaperones, co-chaperones and nucleotide exchange factors . a stress response induced by misfolded cytosolic proteins that do not enter the secretory pathway, called upr-cyto, has been preliminarily characterized in s. cerevisiae
 <cit> . this cytosolic stress response induces the production of several cytosolic chaperones and co-chaperones. the upr-cyto response appears to be a specific hsf1-mediated module of the eukaryotic heat shock response  <cit> . the transcript level of the hsf <dig> homolog in dtt-stressed a. gossypii cells was only slightly increased. moreover, no hsf1p-like consensus binding sequence was overrepresented in the gene clusters analyzed. thus, an upr-cyto may have been activated in a. gossypii in response to secretion stress induced by dtt, but probably not by hsf1p.

another striking difference in the a. gossypii transcriptional responses to dtt-induced stress, compared to that of s. cerevisiae, a. niger or t. reesei, was the rapid and severe down-regulation of the protein glycosylation pathway, an effect that at similar extent has only been described for treatments with tunicamycin. this could lead to an accumulation of improperly glycosylated proteins. in mammals, calnexin provides chaperone activity to retain incompletely glycosylated proteins in the er, functioning as a component of the glycoprotein quality control system in the er  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae homolog cne1p also binds specifically to monoglucosylated oligosaccharides  <cit> . however, no homolog for the cne <dig> was found in the a. gossypii genome. an alternative mechanism of quality control should, therefore, exist to balance this absence.

like the er, the golgi complex may also be involved in conformation-based disposal of abnormal proteins targeted for degradation  <cit> . here we show that several post-er pathways for protein disposal were up-regulated upon dtt treatment in a. gossypii. these included both the retrograde transport of proteins back to the er for erad  and protein transport via the endosomal system for degradation. copii-vesicle mediated export of proteins from the er to the golgi was, however, down-regulated by dtt.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the lack of an active conventional upr in a. gossypii may be compensated by alternative pathways, probably working simultaneously, to relieve the cells from secretion stress. the fact that a. gossypii has one of the smallest eukaryotic genomes known and, consequently, reduced genetic machinery, may have contributed to the differences between its transcriptional responses to secretion stress and those reported for other fungal species. the absence of a calnexin homolog in a. gossypii indicates that it lacks some of the er quality control mechanisms of other fungi.

despite the high genetic similarity it shares with s. cerevisiae, the regulation of the protein secretory pathway of a. gossypii and s. cerevisiae differed considerably. it must not be forgotten that significant sequence similarity between a. gossypii and s. cerevisiae is restricted to coding regions  <cit>  and that regulatory genes are reported to show a higher evolutionary rate than structural genes, resulting in homologous transcriptional factors playing different regulatory functions in different organisms  <cit> . therefore, although earlier results have shown that the a. gossypii protein secretion potential is more similar to yeast than to other filamentous fungi, reflecting phylogentic relationships rather than morphology, the differences in regulation may suggest novel ways of improving protein secretion in a. gossypii.
