BACKGROUND
many plant species emit floral scents as long-distance attraction cues for pollinators, in particular moths, that search and visit flowers at night. the attraction of moths and other animal pollinators have important implications for plant reproductive success; floral scents are important in determining seed or fruit set in non-selfing plants and the frequency of outcross in selfing plants  <cit> . thus, the biosynthesis and release of floral scents have important ecological and agricultural implications and the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of floral scent production are now beginning to be unraveled  <cit> .

floral scents are usually complex mixtures of small volatile molecules and the most prevalent compounds in these mixtures are monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids, benzenoid compounds and fatty acid derivatives  <cit> . volatile compounds can be either emitted from several parts of the flower or from a specific floral part  <cit> . the expression of genes encoding floral scent biosynthetic enzymes is temporally and spatially regulated during flower development  <cit> . in most cases studied so far, the expression of these genes correlates with the emission of the corresponding volatile compound indicating that these volatiles are de novo synthesized. thus, scent production and emission are commonly regulated at the transcriptional level. similar observations have been made in regard to the induction of genes involved in floral pigment production  <cit> .

nicotiana attenuata, a night-flowering tobacco that germinates after fires in the southwestern united states, normally produces flowers that open at night and release benzyl acetone  to attract night-active hawk moth pollinators  <cit> . n. attenuata is a fully self-compatible species however it produces more than 30% of its seed from opportunistic out-crossing performed by pollinators  <cit> . ba is the main constituent of the n. attenuata floral bouquet  <cit>  and it begins to be emitted from the corolla limb in the evening  <cit> . the emission of ba is synchronized with the development of the flower and it starts as the corolla limb opens  <cit> . at present, the mechanisms that control the biosynthesis and release of ba from corollas are largely unknown. the ba biosynthesis pathway remains elusive, however, the chemical backbone may derived from the shikimate pathway  <cit>  as n. attenuata plants with reduced expression of chalcone synthase  <dig>  are deficient in ba emission  <cit> .

the homeodomain-leucine zipper  family of transcription factors  is a plant-specific family of tfs in which the hd and zip domains are combined in a single polypeptide  <cit> . the hd is responsible for the specific binding to dna and the zip domain acts as a dimerization motif; dimerization is a prerequisite for binding to the phylogenetically conserved target sequence caat  attg  <cit> . the hd-zip family can be divided into four subfamilies  according to the sequence similarity of the hd and zip domains and to additional structural features outside these domains. the function of hd-zips type-i has been associated to the regulation of development in response to changes in the environment  <cit> .

the n. attenuata hd <dig> gene was originally identified as an hd-zip type-i whose expression is induced by multiple stress-associated stimuli including drought and wounding  <cit> . in a previous study, we reduced the expression of hd <dig> by virus induced gene silencing  and we demonstrated that hd <dig> plays not only a positive role in aba accumulation in leaves during water stress but also in the emission of benzyl acetone  from night flowers  <cit> . however, the hd20-dependent mechanisms underlying the reduction in ba emission were not studied. here we investigated these mechanisms by generating transgenic n. attenuata plants stably reduced in the expression of hd <dig>  these plants were characterized by using a combination of volatile, phytohormone and gene expression profiling approaches to investigate in more detail the process of ba emission.

RESULTS
hd <dig> mrna expression in corolla during development
to investigate in detail the regulation of hd <dig> mrna expression during flower and corolla development in wt plants, the levels of this transcript were first quantified at progressive stages of flower development. hd <dig> mrna was detected in all flower stages and the levels increased as the flower entered the opened corolla stage ; figure 1a). the expression of hd <dig> was then quantified during the opening of the corolla, which is a continuous process that starts in the afternoon  and completes at  <dig> to 9 pm . hd <dig> mrna levels were quantified at 12 pm, 4 pm, 8 pm and 12 am. the transcript levels increased steadily during the afternoon to peak at 8 pm and to decline at 12 am .

transformation of n. attenuata plants to reduce hd <dig> expression
to investigate the mechanisms mediated by hd <dig> and controlling the emission of ba from flowers, stably transformed n. attenuata plants with reduced levels of hd <dig> expression were generated by inverted-repeat  gene silencing. these lines were named ir-hd <dig> and two homozygous independently transformed lines  carrying a single t-dna insertion  were selected and used for all the experiments in this study . the efficiency of gene silencing in the flowers and corolla of these lines was evaluated by the quantification of hd <dig> transcript levels at different developmental stages. the levels of this transcript were reduced on average between  <dig> and 95%  with the exception of ir-hd20- <dig> that showed wt levels of hd <dig> expression in the closed-bud stage . in corollas, the reduction in hd <dig> mrna levels was 87% in ir-hd20- <dig> and 97% in ir-hd20- <dig> lines . the morphology and growth of ir-hd <dig> plants were indistinguishable from those of wt . flower morphology, flowering time and time of corolla opening were also similar between ir-hd <dig> and wt plants . consistent with n. attenuata plants silenced in hd <dig> expression by vigs  <cit> , bolting time was delayed in ir-hd <dig> plants compared to wt .

hd <dig> positively regulates benzyl acetone emission from corollas
consistent with our previous observations  <cit> , the emission of ba from corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants was reduced by 60% to 70% compared to corollas of wt plants . in this case, the emitted ba was trapped from individual flowers from 3 pm to 9 am . ba was the only volatile detected by gc-ms  from flower headspace samples that showed differential accumulation in ir-hd <dig> samples compared to wt. a second trapping period was also carried out during the second day after the corolla opening . in this case, the levels of emitted ba were similar between wt and ir-hd <dig> plants and were less than 5% of the ba levels emitted during the first night . the analysis of ba levels retained in the corolla after the first night showed that these levels were  <dig>  times lower than the amounts of emitted ba . analysis of ba emission in real time with a znosetm  showed that the amount of ba released by corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants was significantly reduced compared to those of wt plants only after 8 pm.

changes in aba levels correlate with changes in ba emission during corolla opening
to begin to investigate the mechanisms underlying the reduced emission of ba from corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants, we first profiled the accumulation of phytohormones in this tissue during the period of corolla opening. the levels of jasmonic acid  and salicylic acid  transiently increased during corolla opening to reach maximum levels at 8 pm and to decrease afterwards . the levels of ja-ile in corollas were on average  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher than the levels of ja  and they fluctuated on average between  <dig>  and 1 μg gfw- <dig> . the levels of ja, ja-ile and sa were however not significantly different between wt and ir-hd <dig> plants. in contrast, the levels of aba differed between these two genotypes. in corollas of wt plants, the level of aba started to increase at 12 pm and reached 20 μg gfw- <dig> at 4 pm . the levels remained approximately constant until 8 pm and then started to decrease to reach 10 μg gfw- <dig> at 12 am . this oscillation in aba levels was not observed in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants, where aba levels remained approximately constant at  <dig> to 24 μg gfw- <dig> during the time of corolla opening . finally, the levels of ethylene emitted by the corolla were also quantified between  <dig> to 8:30 pm and  <dig> to 10:30 pm and they were similar between wt and ir-hd <dig> plants .

to investigate whether the changes in aba levels quantified in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants were specific to this tissue and not the effect of altered aba accumulation in the whole flower during development, phytohormone levels were quantified in whole flowers  at progressive developmental stages. the results showed that accumulation of aba in whole flowers was similar between wt and ir-hd <dig> plants  and hence the changes in aba accumulation in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants do not result from a general alteration of whole flower aba levels.

to further investigate this association, n. attenuata wt and ir-hd <dig> plants were grown under salt stress, a condition that maintained aba in corollas at levels lower than 20 μg gfw- <dig> and almost completely abrogated the developmental fluctuation of this phytohormone in corollas of wt plants . the salt stress did not affect ba emission from corollas of wt plants . however, salt stress conditions recovered ba emission in ir-hd <dig> plants and the levels of emitted ba were similar to those in wt plants . from these results, we hypothesized that high levels of aba in corollas  have a negative effect on ba emission and that the developmentally controlled 2-fold reduction in aba levels in corollas of wt plants contributes to the emission of this volatile. to test this hypothesis, exogenous aba was supplied to flowers of wt plants and the level of ba emitted from the corollas was quantified. two different approaches were used:  flowers attached to the plant were sprayed with 1 ml of a solution containing 1 μg ml- <dig> aba at 8 pm, and  clipped flowers were placed in scintillation vials and continuously fed through the pedicle with  <dig> μl of a solution containing 1 μg ml- <dig> aba. the levels of aba used in these experiments were in the range of endogenous aba levels quantified in corollas . in the first approach, the emitted ba was trapped from 3 pm to 9 am  and analyzed by gc-ms . in the second approach, the emitted ba was analyzed every two hours starting at 6 pm with a znosetm . corollas from wt plants sprayed with aba emitted 30% less ba than control-treated flowers during the night . consistently, continuously pedicle-fed flowers emitted  <dig> to 50% lower levels of ba at 12 am and 2 am compared to control-treated flowers .

in summary, these experiments indicated that aba levels in corollas contributed either directly or indirectly to the release of ba. the negative effect of aba on ba emission was however only significant after 10 pm, suggesting that the developmentally controlled reduction in aba levels in corollas of wt plants contributes to the late phase of ba release. this conclusion is consistent with the reduction in aba levels after 8 pm in corollas of wt plants .

reduced levels of hd <dig> in corollas have strong effects on gene expression
to study the effect of hd <dig> on the expression of genes in opening corollas, a n. attenuata agilent custom-array containing  <dig>  probes was used  <cit> . rna was isolated from corollas of wt and ir-hd <dig> plants at 12 pm  and used for microarray hybridization . the results of the analysis showed that  <dig> genes were down- and  <dig> up-regulated  > <dig> ) significantly  in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants compared to wt .

the genes affected in their expression were first categorized based on gene ontology . based on these two categories, between  <dig> and 37% of the annotated genes were involved in metabolic processes, respectively . analysis of go categories , revealed that the most prevalent changes in gene expression occurred in enzymes involved in metabolic processes associated to aromatic compounds . more specifically, genes involved in the metabolism of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine  and the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid derivatives were differentially expressed in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants compared to wt . a putative l-amino-acid oxidase  involved in the metabolism of tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine and an unspecific monooxygenase  involved in the metabolism of tryptophan were down-regulated in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants while the transcript levels of the rest of the genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism were up-regulated . the second largest group of metabolic genes affected in their expression in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants was associated with carbohydrate metabolism . in this case, several genes involved in sugar metabolism were down-regulated while two genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis were up-regulated. core genes of the fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis pathways were also affected, and in this case they were up-regulated in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants . together, the changes in the expression of genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism and in sugar and lipid metabolism suggested that hd <dig> participates either directly or indirectly in the control of primary and secondary metabolism in corollas of n. attenuata.

go categorization also showed that 20% of the genes affected in their expression were involved in regulatory processes . among these genes, the most prevalent group was associated to the regulation of gene expression and it included two wrky transcription factors and two chromatin-remodeling factors . the expression of several genes with protein kinase activity  was also affected . among the down-regulated receptor proteins was coronatine insensitive  <dig> , previously associated with developmental processes in flowers  <cit> .

* fc: fold-change .

to further assess the changes in gene expression in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants, the kinetics of expression of a selected group of genes identified by microarray analysis were evaluated by qpcr during the time of corolla opening . three of the selected genes are involved in aromatic compound metabolism, namely chalcone synthase  <dig> , s-adenosyl-l-methionine:benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase  and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase . chal <dig> has been previously associated with ba production in n. attenuata plants  <cit> . the accumulation of these three transcripts was induced in corollas of wt plants during the time of corolla opening to reach maximum levels between  <dig> and 8 pm . consistent with the microarray data, the levels of chal1samt/bamt and dfr mrnas were increased in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants compared to wt .

the expression of two regulatory genes was also analyzed, namely casein kinase  and protein phosphatase 2 c . the expression of ck was induced several fold during corolla opening in wt plants and reached a maximum at 8 pm . in contrast, in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants, the levels of this transcript remained largely non-induced . finally, the levels of pp2c mrna were induced by 2-fold during corolla opening in wt plants and the levels remained approximately 2-fold lower in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants .

discussion
changes in aba levels in opening corollas are associated with ba emission
the expression of hd <dig> in flowers and corollas was consistent with the participation of this transcription factor in the process of ba emission. the levels of hd <dig> mrna were highest in corollas and they increased during the time of corolla opening . the timing of induction correlated with the timing of ba emission which starts in the afternoon and peaks between  <dig> and 10 pm . several hd-zip type-i transcription factors in different plants species are either highly expressed in flowers or have been associated with mechanisms regulating organ development. for example, lehb- <dig> from tomato  regulates floral organogenesis  <cit>  and the arabidopsis hb12hb7hb <dig> and hb <dig> are highly expressed in flowers  <cit> . based on phylogenetic analysis, the arabidopsis hb <dig> and hb <dig> genes group together with hd <dig> in subgroup ic  <cit> .

consistent with our previous study in which the expression of hd <dig> was reduced by vigs in n. attenuata plants  <cit> , plants with stably reduced expression of hd <dig> were also reduced in the levels of ba released from corollas . analysis of ba emission during the first and second nights showed that flowers from ir-hd <dig> plants produced less ba with no delay in its emission . moreover, analysis of the dynamics of ba emission showed that corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants released significantly smaller ba amounts after 8 pm, indicating that reduced hd <dig> expression affected primarily the late phase of ba emission .

in wt plants, hd <dig> mrna levels were detected throughout the time of corolla opening  and peaked at 8 pm . aba levels increased in corollas of wt plants from 12 pm to 4 pm and decrease from 8 pm to 9 am . in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants, this fluctuation in aba levels was not observed  however when aba levels in corollas were reduced by salt stress treatment, the emission of ba was recovered to wt levels . moreover, feeding experiments with exogenous aba decreased ba emission at the late phase of the process . based on these observations, we concluded that there was a direct association between the decline of aba levels in corolla and the late phase of ba emission. thus, the results suggested that hd <dig> contributes partially to ba emission by directly or indirectly affecting aba levels. how hd <dig> affects aba levels in corollas is at present unknown. genome-wide gene expression analysis performed with corolla tissue harvested at 12 pm  did not detect genes involved in aba biosynthesis as differentially expressed. at present, however, it is unknown how the corolla controls aba levels, this could be the result of de novo biosynthesis, import from adjacent tissue, metabolism  or a combination of these processes. although at 12 pm, 2-fold higher levels of aba were detected in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants compared to wt , only one gene homolog to zea mays snrk <dig>  was identified as differentially expressed . little is known about the regulation of gene expression by aba in corollas and aba is known to affect multiple cellular processes  in addition to gene expression  <cit> . moreover, the direct target genes of hd <dig> are thus far unknown in n. attenuata. the mechanisms underlying the reduction in ba emission mediated by hd <dig> and aba are probably very complex and additional experimentation will be required to disentangle this complexity.

changes in metabolic gene expression induced by hd <dig> are associated with ba emission
chalcone synthase  <dig>  is so far the only gene that has been involved in the biosynthesis of ba in n. attenuata plants  <cit> . in other words, the biosynthesis pathway for this floral volatile is largely unknown. chalcone synthases catalyze the first step of flavonoid biosynthesis using malonyl-coenzyme a  and 4-coumaroyl-coa to produce naringenin chalcone  <cit> . 4-coumaroyl-coa is supplied by the phenylpropanoid pathway which utilizes phenylalanine produced by the shikimate pathway in the plastid. tyrosine and tryptophan are also produced by this biosynthesis pathway. naringenin chalcone can be further modified to form flavonoids and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  is the first committed enzyme of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the flavonoid pathway  <cit> . benzoids are also derived from the phenylpropanoid or shikimate pathways and enzymes such as s-adenosyl-l-methionine:benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase  synthesize methyl esters  which are constituents of floral scents of many plant species  <cit> . in petunia hybrida, where benzenoids determine the floral scent, three transcription factors from the r2r3-type myb family have been identified that regulate floral scent production. odorant <dig> , emission of benzenoids ii  and phmyb <dig> affect the expression of several biosynthetic floral scent-related genes encoding enzymes from the phenylpropanoid and shikimate pathways  <cit> .

the analysis of changes in gene expression in opening corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants showed that the most prevalent group of genes with altered expression corresponded to those involved in aromatic compound metabolism and derivatives of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. importantly, no candidate genes involved in ba biosynthesis could be identified, however, as the genes involved in this process are largely unknown and a large fraction of the genes differentially expressed in corollas of ir-hd <dig> are of undescribed function , it is plausible that among these genes some involved in ba biosynthesis are present.

the induction of expression of genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism and derivatives of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway during corolla opening  correlated positively with the emission of ba and with the turning of the corolla limb from green to white. thus, these observations were consistent with the altered levels of ba production in ir-hd <dig> plants and suggested that reduced emission of this floral volatile could be the result of altered gene expression in ba biosynthesis genes. paradoxically, however, in addition to chal <dig>  several other genes involved in different steps of aromatic compound biosynthesis or metabolism were up-regulated in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants . because several genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were down-regulated in corollas of these plants , one plausible explanation for the reduced levels of ba emission in ir-hd <dig> plants is that reduced carbon fluxes through the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways limit ba production. if this is the case, the increased levels of chalcone synthase and other phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes observed in ir-hd <dig> plants may reflect a compensatory mechanism for reduced supply of carbon precursors. a detailed study of the metabolic fluxes of the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways in ir-hd <dig> plants will be necessary to test this hypothesis in the future.

in addition to metabolic genes, multiple regulatory factors also showed altered expression in opening corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants . among the genes in the group of protein kinases and phosphatases were n. attenuata homologues of casein kinase and pp2c . casein kinases  are ubiquitous ser/thr kinases that play critical roles in all higher organisms including plants. for example, the arabidopsis ck <dig> plays important roles in light signaling, circadian rhythms, hormone responses, cell cycle control and flowering time  <cit> . the strong down-regulation of casein kinase suggests that this protein kinase may be important in regulating directly or indirectly ba emissions by hd20-dependent mechanisms. interestingly, similar to hb <dig> and hb <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , the carboxyl terminus of hd <dig> presents three putative phosphorylation sites , suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms can be important for the regulation of its activity.

in connection with aba signaling, a homologue of pp2c was down-regulated approximately two-fold in opening corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants . ppc2s such as abi <dig> and abi <dig>  are rapidly inactivated upon the binding of aba to rcars/pyr1/pyls  <cit> . inactivation of pp2cs triggers the activation of snf1-type kinases that initiate aba-dependent responses such as the activation of gene expression and the regulation of ion channels  <cit> . as their names indicate, mutations in abi <dig> and abi <dig> genes make plants insensitive to aba  <cit> . functional abi <dig> and abi <dig> alleles are necessary for the induction of the arabidopsis hb <dig> and hb <dig> by aba  <cit> . thus, in addition to the de-regulation of aba levels in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants, sensitivity to this phytohormone could also be affected in corollas of these plants.

other interesting genes with receptor activity that changed expression in opening corollas of ir-hd <dig> compared to wt plants were ethylene receptor  <dig> , coronatine insensitive  <dig>  and the circadian clock-associated flavin-binding kelch repeat f-box  <dig>  gene  <cit> . ethylene and ja-ile are important phytohormones for flower development. for example, plants deficient in the expression of coi <dig> are sterile  <cit>  and plants expressing a constitutively active allele of etr <dig> have delayed corolla senescence  <cit> . although ja, ja-ile and ethylene levels were not affected in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants, changes in the sensitivity to these phytohormones may also participate in the regulation of ba emission.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, from the results presented in this study it is clear that multiple metabolic pathways were affected when corollas were reduced in hd <dig> expression, pointing to the importance of this hd-zip transcription factor in the regulation of biochemical processes in this tissue. importantly, reduced expression of hd <dig> did not cause morphological and developmental changes in flowers, indicating that the main function of this transcription factor in this organ relates to the regulation of metabolism rather than development. the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ba levels by hd <dig> are clearly complex and they most likely involve a complex network of factors and aba signaling. as the sequences of the promoter regions of n. attenuata genes become available with the sequencing of this plant’s genome, the analysis of the presence of the universally conserved hd-zip type i binding element attg) <cit>  in genes affected in their expression in ir-hd <dig> plants will facilitate the discovery of direct target genes of hd <dig>
