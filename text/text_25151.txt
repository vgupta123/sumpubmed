BACKGROUND
a. oryzae is a member of the diverse group of aspergilli that includes species that are important microbial cell factories, as well as species that are human and plant pathogens  <cit> . a. oryzae has been used safely in the fermentation industry for hundreds of years in the production of soy sauce, miso and sake. today a. oryzae is also used for production of a wide range of different fungal enzymes such as α-amylase, glucoamylase, lipase and protease and it is regarded as an ideal host for the synthesis of proteins of eukaryotic origin  <cit> . in the post genome-sequencing era, various high-throughput technologies have been developed to characterize biological systems on the genome-scale  <cit> . discovering new biological knowledge from high-throughput biological data and assigning biological functions to all the proteins encoded by the genome is, however, challenging and allowing systems level investigations of microbial cell factory. for fungi, several genome-sequencing and annotation projects have been presented, including saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , a. nidulans  <cit> , a. fumigatus  <cit> , and a. niger  <cit> . recently, genome sequence of a. oryzae by machida and his coworkers has been published  <cit> . based on their sequence annotation using gene-finding software tools such as aln  <cit> , glimmerm  <cit>  and genedecoder  <cit> , this analysis  <dig>  genes encoding proteins were predicted to be present in the genome  <cit> . despite this prediction many genes had not been assigned a definite function, and of the  <dig>  genes, more than 50% were annotated as hypothetical proteins. hence, there are clearly opportunities for refining the gene prediction and improving the annotation. however, the present one dimensional data does not allow for complete annotation of all genes and it would therefore be interesting and potentially fruitful to use integrative biological tools in the process of improving the annotation of fungal genomes  <cit> . in this process reconstruction of a genome-scale metabolic model is a good starting point as it allows for integration of various types of data. nowadays, there are several open sources of fungal metabolic models, such as for s. cerevisiae  <cit> , a. nidulans  <cit> , a. niger  <cit>  and a model for the central carbon metabolism of a. niger  <cit> . these models currently are prominent as one of the most promising approaches to achieve an in silico prediction of cellular function in terms of physiology  <cit> .

the aim of this study is to improve the annotation of the genome sequence of a. oryzae and further integrate enhanced annotated data to construct a genome-scale metabolic model of a. oryzae. the first a. oryzae est library, sequencing and assembly were performed in order to improve gene prediction. then functional assignment was done by our developed annotation strategy and a combination of different bioinformatics tools and databases. the bioinformatics tools used were blast  <cit> , hmmer  <cit> , and psi-blast  <cit> . several databases used were namely the a. oryzae genome database  <cit> , the est database of a. flavus  <cit> , the a. nidulans genome database  <cit> , the a. fumigatus genome database  <cit> , the s. cerevisiae genome database  <cit> , the pfam protein families database  <cit> , the cog database  <cit> , and the non-redundant  protein database  <cit> . subsequently, manual inspection was through in order to achieve a solid annotation for enzyme functions that were needed for reconstruction of the metabolic network. based on the improved annotated genome, the genome-scale metabolic network was reconstructed. the network was built by comparison with other related metabolic models, namely models for s. cerevisiae  <cit> , a. nidulans  <cit> , and a. niger  <cit> , and biochemical pathway databases, literature, as well as experimental evidence for the presence of specific pathways. the biomass composition was taken from the literature, whereas, maintenance and growth-associated atp consumption rates were estimated based on literature data on yields and growth rates. finally, flux balance analysis  was used to predict the flux distributions in the metabolic network, and the biomass yields as well as growth rates on different carbon sources were estimated to validate the metabolic model of a. oryzae.

RESULTS
gene discovery and validation
the assembled est sequences of a. oryzae were achieved from this study  where were deposited into genbank database under accession numbers "ey424375–433412". within our assembled est data analysis of a. oryzae, we found  <dig>  est contig sequences with a gc content of  <dig> % and an average est length of  <dig> base pairs . based on analysis of sequences obtained from machida and coworkers  <cit> , the a. oryzae genome consists of eight chromosomes containing  <dig>  megabases  with a gc content of  <dig> % and  <dig>  annotated genes. according to the described strategy implemented for gene finding , the  <dig>  est sequences were searched against the  <dig>  previously identified genes  <cit>  in the sequenced genome using various search parameters to create lists of predicted genes with different match stringencies. using the criteria described in the methods, many dissimilar sequences between the est sequences and previously identified gene sequences of a. oryzae  <cit>  were found. this suggests the presence of many newly predicted genes. interestingly, approximately 12%  were categorized as newly predicted genes in the genome. many homolog sequences were also found strongly validating previously identified genes  <cit> , with approximately 75% of the total est sequences  matching earlier identified genes . to confirm that all the est sequences do existed in the a. oryzae genome, the  <dig>  est sequences were searched by blastn  <cit>  against the complete genome, and the results showed that only  <dig> est sequences could not be found to be present in the genome. therefore, this suggests that the assembled est data of a. oryzae had very high quality and showed an excellent success rate for gene discovery and validation, even though approximately 13%  could not be used to predict genes, because 6%  were too short and about 7%  were too weakly validated in the original gene list using a conservative cut-off. in another attempt to predict new genes in a. oryzae genome, a. flavus est contigs stored in the tigr public database  <cit>  were also used because a. flavus and a. oryzae are very closely related  <cit> . also, there is a high degree of dna homology between the two organisms   <cit> . a. flavus est library contained  <dig>  sequences with a gc content of  <dig> % and an average est length of  <dig>  bps. using these a. flavus est sequences to search against the genes in our new gene list for the a. oryzae genome, no new genes were predicted but  <dig>  genes in the a. oryzae genome were validated by est sequences . based on all the results of the gene finding a total of  <dig>  protein-encoding genes were identified in the a. oryzae genome. this total number of genes derives from  <dig>  previously annotated genes by machida et al and  <dig>  newly predicted genes from our assembled est library.

identification of protein functions by pairwise comparison
in order to assign protein functions to the  <dig>  predicted genes, sequence alignment analysis by pairwise comparison between a. oryzae and closely related fungi was performed. these fungi included a. nidulans, a. fumigatus and s. cerevisiae. table  <dig> shows some genome characteristics of the related fungi in comparison with a. oryzae. initially pairwise comparison was done by similarity searching of the protein sequences of a. oryzae against the protein sequences of other related fungi as described in the methods. with a chosen threshold of the alignment length  and identity , a list of putative protein functions was created. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  pairwise comparison shows that a. fumigatus has  <dig>  homologs with a. oryzae sequences. it is the highest number of sequence homologs and this indicates the highest percentage  of the homologs obtained between the three species tested. this result is consistent with the fact that a. oryzae and a. fumigatus are the phylogenetically closest species of those evaluated  <cit> . upon completion of the similarity searching, the results suggest that  <dig>  genes in a. oryzae could be assigned as orthologous genes from the three fungi used for comparison. of these  <dig>  protein sequences,  <dig>  sequences were assigned putative protein functions for a. oryzae. these functions were mainly obtained from a. fumigatus . the remaining  <dig>  sequences that have homologs in the three other fungi could not been assigned any function yet, and they are therefore classified as hypothetical proteins. the putative functions annotated here were classified using biological process  type from the gene ontology  database  <cit> . the genes and functions that have biological process terms involved in metabolism, including both biosynthesis and catabolism, were extracted and used for metabolic network reconstruction. the results of this process show that the a. oryzae genome contains  <dig>  genes  encoding  <dig>  different protein functions involved in metabolism.

metabolic pathway mapping
the metabolic models for s. cerevisiae  <cit> , a. nidulans  <cit> , and a. niger  <cit>  were combined to generate an initial reaction list for the construction of the a. oryzae metabolic network. duplicated reactions were removed resulting in a list of  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  functions involved in metabolism. for each enzyme function involved in this reaction list it was searched in the above generated list of metabolic proteins present in a. oryzae. if an enzyme name matched, then the enzyme-encoding genes, enzyme functions and enzyme commission  numbers of a. oryzae were selected and mapped onto this reaction list. hereafter a classification system was established to divide reactions in the whole metabolic network of a. oryzae into  <dig> main metabolic pathways: carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, lipid metabolism, cofactor metabolism and secondary metabolism. it is hereby found that the highest number of enzyme-encoding genes is involved in carbohydrate metabolism, which is consistent with the fact that a. oryzae has the ability to use a wide range of carbohydrate substrates. for amino acid and lipid metabolisms, many enzyme-encoding genes were also found. a lower number of enzyme-encoding genes were found in nucleotide, cofactor and energy metabolisms. the lowest number of enzyme-encoding genes was found in secondary metabolism. in fact, the a. oryzae genome contains a lot of enzyme-encoding genes involved in secondary metabolism  <cit> , but most of these genes are without ec numbers and could therefore not be mapped onto the metabolic network. the hereby resulting metabolic network contains several gaps, which means that there are metabolic reactions without corresponding enzymes.

filling gaps in the metabolic network using an integrated bioinformatics tool
in order to identify genes encoding more enzyme functions and hereby reduce the number of gaps in the metabolic network, an integrated bioinformatics tool was developed and used to identify these missing enzymes. this tool called "gap filler for aspergillus oryzae pathway " was developed in- house by combining different bioinformatics tools  and databases . gfaop is similar to the mcconkey searching algorithm which has been used for enzyme identification in eukaryote genomes  <cit> . the method is also related to osterman's method for the identification of bacterial genes encoding metabolic functions  <cit> . an overview of gfaop is shown in figure  <dig>  first, the tool was validated by searching for  <dig> known protein functions in a. oryzae using the information from the genome database  <cit> . the tool confirmed 100% accuracy of the prediction. this tool was then used to search for functional activity related to missing enzyme  in the metabolic reaction. to illustrate this approach, one of the missing enzymes ) in the pathway of xylose degradation of a. oryzae is selected as an example. to answer the question of whether there is a gene encoding d-xylose reductase in a. oryzae. gfaop was applied as follows. first the hmmer program generates a hidden markov model  profile of this enzyme  from the protein families databases . second, a consensus sequence is generated. third, the consensus sequence is searched against the a. oryzae genome by a psi-blast  <cit> . sequences where the hit has suitable statistical significance values are selected and extracted for protein function assignment by searching against the nr protein database  <cit>  using blast  <cit>  to verify its probable function.

the result clearly shows that there is a high probability for that the gene called "ao090003000859" encode d-xylose reductase. based on searching of this gene in the a. oryzae genome database  <cit> , the gene name ao <dig> is only reported for general prediction and poorly characterized functions. moreover, the exploration in other databases such as the genbank, this gene name is only showed to have a region encoding aldo/keto reductase family proteins, but there is no evidence on the specific function of the gene. as a result from using gfaop, the missing enzyme of d-xylose reductase is entered into the pathway. our method results in an improved annotation of the genome using the context of the metabolic network. an iterative process was done for filling all the gaps in the whole metabolic network. ultimately,  <dig> gaps in the metabolic network were closed using gfaop. these gaps distributed with  <dig> gaps in lipid metabolism,  <dig> gaps in secondary metabolism,  <dig> gaps in amino acid metabolism,  <dig> gaps in nucleotide metabolism,  <dig> gaps in carbohydrate metabolism,  <dig> gaps in cofactor metabolism, and  <dig> gaps in energy metabolism.

characteristics of the improved annotation and reconstructed metabolic network
the annotation process resulted in the improved annotated data shown in table  <dig> where the data are compared with values in the a. oryzae genome database by machida et al  <cit> . the results show that the number of improved annotated genes is  <dig>  which are higher than the number of genes in the database  <cit> . of these improved annotated data, the predicted genes and the putative functions are distributed into different groups. the first group contains new putative protein functions assigned to newly predicted genes, and it contains  <dig> new putative protein functions that are divided into  <dig> metabolic functions and  <dig> other functional groups. the second group contains hypothetical proteins assigned to newly predicted genes and it contains  <dig> hypothetical proteins. the third group is new putative protein functions assigned to proteins previously annotated as hypothetical proteins, and this group comprises  <dig>  proteins of which  <dig> proteins have metabolic functions. the final group contains genes that is found to have the same putative protein function as previously reported in the database  <cit> . in total the hereby annotated genome of a. oryzae contains  <dig>  protein functions of which  <dig>  have metabolic functions. even though the genome still contains  <dig>  hypothetical proteins this is less than the  <dig>  hypothetical proteins currently reported in the database  <cit> , and our work therefore resulted in a substantial improvement of the genome annotation. an enhanced annotated data were mapped on the a. oryzae genome by using the perl scalable vector graphics  module v <dig>   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows an example of gene and est mapping on the contig of ap <dig> which is a part of chromosome  <dig> of the a. oryzae genome. the complete genomic map is available as additional file  <dig>  the list of all ests and genes contained on the genomic map is presented as additional file  <dig> 

an improved annotated data is compared with genome database of a. oryzae  <cit> . the reconstructed metabolic network of a. oryzae is compared with the reconstructed metabolic network of a. nidulans  <cit> 

as previously mentioned the improved annotation resulted in a final reconstructed metabolic network that contains  <dig> enzymes,  <dig>   biochemical reactions and  <dig>  metabolites . the large number of isoenzymes  points to a very high degree of flexibility in the metabolic network of a. oryzae. the  <dig>  unique biochemical reactions are distributed into  <dig> cytosolic,  <dig> mitochondrial,  <dig> perosixomal, and  <dig> extracellular reactions. there are  <dig>  reactions that function as transport processes, and of these  <dig>  are included on the basis of gene assignments whereas there are no annotated genes for  <dig> of the transport reactions. all the genes and functions involved in metabolism were inspected manually. a total of  <dig>  genes without duplication represented as enzyme-encoding genes are included in the reconstructed network. this corresponded to about 10% of the  <dig>  total predicted genes of a. oryzae. for model comparison, the metabolic network of a. nidulans  <cit>  was chosen, and it shows that the metabolism of a. oryzae is much larger than that of a. nidulans as it contains a higher number of genes, enzymes, metabolites and reactions . a list of the reactions in the reconstructed metabolic network that comprised the genes, ec numbers and enzymes was hereby obtained . to illustrate a whole network, overall metabolic map of a. oryzae was drawn as shown in figure  <dig>  to represent a valuable link between genes, enzymes, metabolic reactions and metabolites. the complete metabolite list  is also given as additional file  <dig> 

biomass growth simulation
using the reconstructed metabolic network, a stoichiometric model was developed and subsequently used to simulate growth. a list of the reactions that comprise the stoichiometric model is presented as additional file  <dig>  to describe growth, biomass production is regarded as a drain of macromolecules and building blocks required to produce cellular components. the demands on each of these compounds are estimated based on the biomass composition. no drain of free metabolites or dilution of the metabolite pool due to biomass growth is considered  <cit> . the cellular composition considered for a. oryzae is based on the contents of the main biomass components of a. oryzae  <cit>  as shown in table  <dig> . in addition, concerning the biomass composition, the only parameters that have to be estimated are key energetic parameters: atp requirement for non-growth associated purposes , atp requirement for synthesis of biomass from macromolecules  and the operational p/o ratio. these parameters can not be determined independently, but if one of the parameters is known the others can be estimated from experimental data. the operational p/o ratio was assumed to be  <dig>   <cit> , and matp  was estimated to be  <dig>  and katp  was estimated by fitting model simulation with experimental data obtained at a specific growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  <cit>  with glucose as the sole carbon source. the value of katp was hereby estimated to be  <dig> mmoles atp/g dw.

assessment of model validation of a. oryzae
the model was evaluated by simulating a. oryzae cell growth on different carbon sources and comparison of the simulated data to the experimentally determined growth rate and biomass yield from literature data  <cit> . for each carbon source the substrate uptake rate was estimated from measurements of the substrate concentration in the medium, and this value is used as input to the model. from this input the flux distributions corresponding to optimal growth are calculated by maximizing the flux of the reaction leading to biomass. the validation results are shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  from the results, figure  <dig> indicates that the model can accurately predict the maximum specific growth rate  during batch cultivations on different carbon sources . the accuracy is on average about 98% of the experimentally determined value. figure  <dig> also shows that the model can accurately predict the biomass yield  during chemostat cultivations on different carbon sources. the small deviation can be explained by kinetic or genetic regulation within the metabolism, which is not accounted for in the model  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a strategy for the improved annotation of the genome sequence of a. oryzae was developed. using our assembled est library,  <dig>  est sequences  were discovered as newly predicted genes and about 75%  were used to validate previously annotated genes. this indicates that the developed annotation strategy is a very useful approach for gene prediction. applying a combination of various bioinformatics tools and databases, this annotation strategy was successfully applied for function assignment of genes. a high number of newly predicted genes were assigned with  <dig> new putative functions, and with new putative functions to  <dig>  proteins previously annotated as hypothetical proteins. therefore our analysis results in a substantially reduced number of hypothetical proteins. in particular, more enzyme-encoding genes could be assigned functions and this led to filling of  <dig> missing enzymes in the metabolic network. applying the enhanced annotated genome, biochemical pathway databases, other related metabolic models, and the literature, a metabolic network was reconstructed. the network contains  <dig> enzymes,  <dig>  enzyme-encoding genes ,  <dig>  metabolites and  <dig>   biochemical reactions. the  <dig>  unique reactions are distributed into different compartments, with  <dig> reactions located in the cytosol,  <dig> reactions located in the mitochondria,  <dig> reactions located in the perosixome, and  <dig> reactions located in the extracellular space. transport reactions between the different compartments and the extracellular space represents  <dig>  reactions. this metabolic network was formulated to a stoichiometric model. the model was applied for flux balance analysis  to obtain the flux distributions corresponding to maximized growth. a physiological study on different carbon sources of a. oryzae was performed to validate the genome-scale model, and the model is found to accurately predict the maximum specific growth rate and the biomass yield on different carbon sources. this indicates that the a. oryzae metabolic model is able to simulate the phenotypic behavior and the model will hereby serve as an important resource for gaining further insight into our understanding of the important cell factory a. oryzae.
