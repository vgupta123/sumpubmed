BACKGROUND
wnts are powerful regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation, and their signaling pathway involves proteins that directly participate in both gene transcription and cell adhesion  <cit> . over the past two decades,  <dig> members of the wnt protein family have been found in mammals and have been subdivided into canonical signaling, with transforming activities in mammary epithelial cells, and non canonical signaling involved in the planar cell polarity  and in calcium signaling  <cit> . member of the wnt family, wnt <dig> is classified as a non-canonical wnt protein even though there is evidence that it is also able to activate the canonical signaling pathway  <cit> . wnt <dig> knockdown highlighted its crucial role in the development of several organs such as kidney, ovary and mammary gland  <cit> . moreover, wnt <dig> null mice die within 24 h of birth, probably because of severe lack of kidney functions  <cit> . in fact, during kidney development wnt <dig> plays a key role in the mesenchymal to epithelial transition and in the morphogenesis required for tubule formation  <cit> , and its expression is regulated by the transcription factor pax <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, in humans defects in wnt <dig> are a cause of rokitansky-kuster-hauser syndrome  characterized by utero-vaginal atresia in otherwise phenotypically normal female with a normal  <dig> xx karyotype  <cit> . homozygous null mutation in wnt <dig> is the cause of female sex reversal with dysgenesis of kidneys, adrenals, and lungs , demonstrating that this gene plays an essential role in human sex-determination and organogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, mutations in the wnt <dig> gene also cause wnt <dig> müllerian aplasia and ovarian dysfunction  <cit> .

recently, wnt <dig> was shown to be strongly down-regulated in human anaplastic carcinomas and to behave as a key factor in ras-mediated transformation of rat epithelial cells  <cit> . in addition, the analysis of the gene expression profile of frtl- <dig> differentiated thyroid cells after the silencing of the transcription factor pax <dig> identified wnt <dig> among the down-regulated genes and by chip assay wnt <dig> was defined as a novel direct target of pax <dig>  <cit> .

pax <dig>  a member of the pax genes family, was shown to be required for both morphogenesis of the thyroid gland  <cit>  and maintenance of the thyroid differentiated phenotype  <cit> . interestingly, mutations in the pax <dig> gene have been associated with congenital hypothyroidism in humans  <cit> . during the embryogenesis pax <dig> is expressed not only in the thyroid but also in other tissues such as the metanephros, the midhindbrain boundary region  <cit> , as well as in the müllerian duct  <cit> . in pax <dig> knockout mice, the thyroid gland is barely visible and lacks the follicular cells; accordingly, the expression of the thyroid-specific markers thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase cannot be detected in line with the crucial role that pax <dig> plays in thyrocytes differentiation  <cit> . moreover, as a consequence of their athyroidism, pax <dig> deficient mice are deaf, growth retarded, ataxic, and do not survive weaning. as in most cases of congenital hypothyroid patients, in pax8-deficient mice the symptoms can be reversed by the th replacement therapy if instituted within the first days of postnatal life  <cit> . it is of interest to note that pax8-/- mice that were properly substituted with th and developed otherwise normally without any overt deficits did not become fertile  <cit> . indeed, the analysis of the male and female reproductive system demonstrated that the pax8-/- mice fail to develop correctly  <cit> .

here, we investigated the involvement of pax <dig> in the regulation of wnt <dig> gene expression in thyroid cells. the in silico analysis of the 5’-flanking region of the wnt <dig> gene identified several putative pax <dig> binding sites and our data here reported show that indeed pax <dig> is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the wnt <dig> gene. all together, our results indicate that in thyroid cells pax <dig> participates to wnt <dig> gene expression directly binding to its 5′-flanking region and that a reduced expression of wnt <dig> correlates with the alteration of the epithelial phenotype. moreover, we also show that the overexpression of wnt <dig> in thyroid cancer cells is able to inhibit cellular migration.

RESULTS
wnt <dig> expression in thyroid cells is modulated by tsh
in the past, we observed that in frtl- <dig> cells cultured in the absence of tsh, pax <dig> mrna and protein rapidly disappear, whereas upon tsh stimulation, both mrna and protein are newly synthesized  <cit> . to investigate the role of tsh in wnt <dig> expression, frtl- <dig> cells were starved for 4 days in  <dig> % calf serum-medium and subsequently treated with tsh for 24 hours. the expression of both pax <dig> and wnt <dig> was analyzed at the protein level by immunofluorescence. as expected, pax <dig> expression is strongly reduced upon starvation of the cells and reinduced upon tsh stimulation. similarly, also the expression of wnt <dig> turned out to be modulated by tsh in a way that well correlates with pax <dig> expression profile suggesting that tsh regulation of wnt <dig> expression could be mediated by pax <dig> .

previous studies associated wnt proteins with glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix and bound tightly to the cell surface  <cit> . beyond this information, the localization of wnt proteins in vertebrates remains unclear. the immunofluorescence experiment in figure 1a allowed us to obtain information also on the subcellular distribution of the wnt <dig> protein in thyroid cells, showing the presence of wnt <dig> exclusively in the cytoplasmic compartment of this cell type.to better clarify whether tsh stimulation of wnt <dig> expression is entirely mediated by pax <dig>  we performed a pax <dig> knock-down experiment. in details, frtl- <dig> thyroid cells were transfected with sigenome pax <dig> sirna  or sigenome non-targeting sirna , a scrambled sequence that does not show homology with any rat gene. few hours after transfection, cells were starved in  <dig> % calf serum medium for 24 hours and then stimulated for 3 hours with tsh. the expression of both pax <dig> and wnt <dig> was analyzed at the mrna level by qrt-pcr. interestingly, when pax <dig> is inhibited by the silencing, the stimulation with tsh does not induce high levels of wnt <dig> as it happens in the sictrl- sample . this result supports the hypothesis that a significant fraction of wnt <dig> response to tsh stimulation is indeed mediated by pax <dig> 

the 5′-flanking region of the wnt <dig> gene is responsive to pax8
to determine whether pax <dig> could regulate wnt <dig> gene expression by directly binding to its regulatory genomic sequence, we performed a computational analysis using the matinspector software  <dig> . we searched for pax <dig> binding sites in a region of about  <dig> kb in the wnt <dig> 5′-flanking region and the analysis showed the presence of several pax <dig> binding sequences.to characterize more in detail the genomic region upstream the wnt <dig> gene and to assess its transcriptional activity in thyroid cells, five different fragments corresponding to progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking region were subcloned in the pgl3-basic vector upstream the luciferase reporter gene. all the deletions were engineered taking into account the position of the pax <dig> binding sites predicted by the matinspector software .to verify the transcriptional activity of each fragment, the deletion constructs were transiently transfected in frtl- <dig> thyroid cells and in hela cells, the latter negative for the expression of pax <dig>  the results obtained demonstrate that all the constructs have a high transcriptional activity in thyroid cells. interestingly, only the smallest construct carrying 190 bp of the wnt <dig> 5′-flanking region shows a strongly reduced activity in the frtl- <dig> cells . these data indicate that the 5′-flanking region of wnt <dig> is transcriptionally active in thyroid cells and prompted us to further study the role of pax <dig> in the modulation of wnt <dig> expression. initially, we tested the effect of pax <dig> transient expression on the - <dig> and - <dig> promoter regions by luciferase assays . specifically, we performed transactivation assays in hela cells by transfecting the reporter constructs 300wnt4luc and 190wnt4luc together with increasing concentration of pax <dig>  as shown in figure 2b, pax <dig> is able to activate transcription from the 300wnt4luc reporter in a dose dependent manner but not from the smallest construct 190wnt4luc, suggesting that the region between -300 bp and -190 bp upstream the translational start site of the wnt <dig> gene is required for pax <dig> positive modulation. subsequently, to further confirm the ability of pax <dig> to physically interact with the wnt <dig> promoter region in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays on genomic dna from frtl- <dig> cells. the cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated using a specific antibody against pax <dig>  the enrichment of the endogenous wnt <dig> region was monitored by pcr amplification using specific primers designed to amplify the region of wnt <dig> between -300 bp and -190 bp required for pax <dig> transcriptional activation. the chip assay demonstrates that, in agreement with the transactivation data, pax <dig> is able to bind in vivo the wnt <dig> promoter .

identification of a pax <dig> binding site on the wnt <dig> proximal promoter region
the in silico analysis by the matinspector software predicted two binding sites for pax <dig> within the region spanning from -300 bp to -190 bp upstream the atg of the wnt <dig> gene that we named a and b, respectively. specifically, site a was identified on the negative strand, while site b was identified on the positive strand of the dna sequence, positioned on the rat promoter at - <dig> and -211 bp from the atg, respectively. the alignment of the core sequence of the two putative pax <dig> binding sites shows a high grade of conservation among the species, highlighting the potential relevance of these sites for wnt <dig> expression .to further characterize and verify the prediction obtained by the matinspector analysis, we designed two oligo probes, containing the putative binding sites a and b, and we performed gel mobility shift experiments. interestingly, the retarded band observed when the frtl- <dig> protein extract was incubated with oligo a  is similar to that observed in the positive control . in contrast, the predicted binding site b could not be confirmed as a pax <dig> binding site . afterwards, we demonstrated by competition and supershift assays that the shift observed when the frtl- <dig> extract is incubated with oligo a is the result of a specific interaction . all together, these results demonstrate that pax <dig> is able to specifically bind to the sequence identified in this study.to demonstrate the functional relevance of pax <dig> binding to the wnt <dig> promoter, we generated a deletion mutant  that lacks the sequence predicted to be recognized by pax <dig>  luciferase reporter constructs 300wnt4luc and 260wnt4luc were transiently transfected into frtl- <dig> cells and the luciferase activity was measured 48 h later. as shown in figure 3c, transfection of the 300wnt4luc construct produces high levels of luciferase activity, while the selective deletion of pax <dig> binding site results in a reduced activity of the 260wnt4luc construct , indicating that the binding site a that we have identified is necessary for wnt <dig> full promoter activity.

wnt <dig> is responsible for the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype
recently, wnt <dig> was demonstrated to be essential for normal conversion of metanephric mesenchyme to the epithelia of the nephron  <cit> . this evidence prompted us to investigate the involvement of wnt <dig> in the emt process also in epithelial thyroid cells. to this end, we inhibited wnt <dig> expression in frtl- <dig> by means of rna interference and we analyzed by qrt-pcr the expression level of some emt markers. seventy-two hours after sirna transfection, we analyzed the expression level of wnt <dig>  e-cadherin  as an epithelial marker and α-smooth muscle actin  and vimentin  as mesenchymal markers. by qrt-pcr we show that upon wnt <dig> knockdown, the mrna level of e-cad is reduced while the expression level of the mesenchymal markers α-sma and vim is upregulated with respect to the frtl- <dig> transfected with sictrl- .our findings demonstrate that reduced levels of wnt <dig> correlate with emt, suggesting a relevant role of this gene in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype of frtl- <dig> thyroid cells. to better clarify the involvement of wnt <dig> in this process, we generated frtl- <dig> cells overexpressing wnt <dig> and we analyzed, by qrt-pcr and western blot, the expression level of the emt markers above mentioned. the stable overexpression of wnt <dig> is able to revert the mesenchymal phenotype; in fact, the upregulation of wnt <dig> determines a stabilization of e-cad and a reduction of α-sma and vim . the apparent difference between mrna and protein level of vim in our opinion could be due to the biological differences between transcript and protein abundance, underlining the importance of post-translational mechanisms controlling gene expression.

wnt <dig> is down-regulated in human thyroid cancer cells and its overexpression inhibits cellular migration
we analyzed the expression level of wnt <dig> in human thyroid cancer cell lines by qrt-pcr. in particular, we analyzed the wro, cal <dig>  fb <dig> and bcpap cells derived from follicular, anaplastic and papillary thyroid carcinoma, and a pool of six normal thyroid  tissues as control. as expected, in all the thyroid cancer cell lines the expression level of wnt <dig> is strongly reduced with respect to normal thyroid , indicating that a down-regulation of wnt <dig> occurs in thyroid carcinoma. interestingly, also the expression of pax <dig> is significantly down-regulated in the same cell lines. the same result has been obtained by western blot analysis . to further evaluate the involvement of wnt <dig> in thyroid tumors we overexpressed wnt <dig> in the bcpap cell line and we selected a bcpap-wnt <dig> mass population. in parallel, we also generated a control mass population transfected with the backbone vector .to study whether elevated levels of wnt <dig> might have a role in cell migration, we performed wound-healing assays using the two mass populations described above. the assay shows that after 12 hours the area of the wound is completely recovered by the bcpap parental and the bcpap-pcefl cells. at difference, the motility of the bcpap-wnt <dig> cells appears strongly impaired, suggesting that wnt <dig> overexpression significantly reduces the migration ability of human papillary thyroid cells .

discussion
in the last few years many data revealed that a set of transcriptional regulators, unique to the thyroid follicular cell type, has been identified as responsible for thyroid-specific gene expression. it comprises three transcription factors: ttf- <dig>  foxe- <dig> and pax <dig>  each of which is expressed also in cell types different from the thyroid follicular cells. albeit, the specific combination of these factors is unique to the thyroid hormone producing cells, strongly suggesting that such combination plays an important role in the differentiation process of these cells  <cit> . in particular, the transcription factor pax <dig> is a master gene for thyroid differentiation, being necessary for the transcriptional activation of all the known differentiation markers  <cit> . moreover, pax <dig> knockout mice show a severe thyroid phenotype  <cit>  and are unfertile  <cit> . in humans, patients carrying mutations in the pax <dig> gene suffer from congenital hypothyroidism  <cit> .

together with the transcription factor pax <dig>  pax <dig> is also a central regulator of both nephron differentiation and branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney. both transcription factors are necessary and sufficient for the formation of the pronephros and all subsequent kidney structures, regulating key target genes involved in pro/mesonephros formation  <cit> . in parallel, a cooperative role for pax <dig> and pax <dig> in metanephric branching morphogenesis and nephron differentiation has been uncovered  <cit> .

in thyroid, wnt <dig> has been recently demonstrated to be a key player in ras-mediated transformation of epithelial cells. moreover, our recent data suggested that wnt <dig> could be a direct target of pax <dig> in frtl- <dig> rat thyroid cells  <cit> .

in this study, we show that pax <dig> modulates the expression of wnt <dig> at the transcriptional level. by emsa, chip and transfection assays, we demonstrate that pax <dig> directly binds to the wnt <dig> promoter region and activates transcription from it.

it is well known that tsh is the main regulator of thyroid differentiation  <cit> . its role in this process has been studied in different model systems  <cit>  and the expression of several thyroid-specific genes, such as tg, tpo, tshr and nis has been shown to be modulated by tsh/camp. in the past, we demonstrated that in pccl <dig> cells, tsh regulates the expression of tg and pax <dig> at the transcriptional level by a camp-mediated mechanism  <cit> . here, we show that in frtl- <dig> rat thyroid cells also the expression of wnt <dig> is under the control of tsh and that this control is likely mediated by pax <dig>  in fact, tsh deprivation causes a significant reduction of both pax <dig> and wnt <dig> and the kinetic of induction of wnt <dig> expression upon tsh stimulation well correlates with that of pax <dig>  interestingly, it has been demonstrated that tsh supports maintenance of thyroid follicular integrity in primary cultured pig thyrocytes, stabilizing e-cadherin at the cell surface and preventing its accelerated turnover to support the maintenance of thyroid follicular integrity  <cit> . therefore, we would like to propose that tsh promotes and ensures the maintenance of the architecture and integrity of the follicles also regulating the expression of wnt <dig>  of course, this is currently a hypothesis that requires further investigations and experimental validations.

the epithelial-mesenchymal transition  is an orchestrated series of events in which cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix  interactions are altered to release epithelial cells from the surrounding tissue. the cytoskeleton is reorganized to confer the ability to move through a three-dimensional ecm, and a new transcriptional program is induced to maintain the mesenchymal phenotype. induction of emt can compromise the mechanical and physiological integrity of the tissue, and inappropriate induction of this process can have disastrous consequences. emt also acts in tumor progression by providing increased resistance to apoptotic agents  <cit>  and by producing supporting tissues that enhance the malignancy of the central tumor.

recently, wnt <dig> has been demonstrated to be critical for mesenchyme – epithelium transition of the epithelia of the nephron  <cit> . in agreement with these data, we report in this manuscript that in frtl- <dig> thyroid cells wnt <dig> is involved in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. in fact, the emt induced by wnt <dig> down-regulation can be reverted in the cellular model system that stable overexpresses wnt <dig>  these results allow us to suggest that in thyroid cells, as in kidney cells, the expression of wnt <dig> correlates with the integrity of the epithelial phenotype.

many publications emphasize the role of the wnt/β-catenin pathway in thyroid cancer. recently, it has been shown that wnt <dig> down-regulation is necessary for the progression of thyroid epithelial tumors toward a fully malignant phenotype  <cit> . moreover, it has been extensively demonstrated that a progressive decrease of pax <dig> level occurs in thyroid tumors from follicular adenoma to differentiated carcinoma and then to anaplastic carcinoma, which parallels the progressive dedifferentiation and increasing malignancy of thyroid tumors  <cit> . here, we show that in human thyroid cancer cell lines, wnt <dig> and pax <dig> mrna levels are strongly reduced. moreover, the overexpression of wnt <dig> in human papillary cancer cells is able to affect the stabilization of the epithelial state and to inhibit cellular migration.

in the future, it will be interesting to further clarify the role of wnt <dig> in thyroid differentiation and tumorigenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented in this study demonstrate that the transcriptional factor pax <dig> is involved in the transcriptional modulation of wnt <dig> gene expression in differentiated thyroid cells. furthermore, we show that a reduced expression of wnt <dig> correlates with the alteration of the epithelial phenotype and that wnt <dig> overexpression in thyroid cancer cells is able to inhibit cellular migration. taken together, our data highlight a potential intriguing role of wnt <dig> in the context of the thyroid cell.
