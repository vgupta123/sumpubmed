BACKGROUND
gene duplication has long been recognized as a major source of evolutionary innovation  <cit> . it is a pervasive evolutionary process, with 50% of all genes in any given genome expected to duplicate and proliferate at least once in time scales ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ma  <cit> . in molecular phylogenetics, gene duplication is a process that can lead to discordance between gene and species trees, and previous work has shown large problems with duplicate genes undergoing concerted evolution or birth-and-death processes  <cit> . the consensus has been to avoid the use of paralogous genes until methods are developed to handle their potential confounding effects  <cit> . given the high likelihood of gene duplication under neutral evolutionary processes, however, as the size of molecular data sets gets larger  the amplification of duplicated genes may happen inadvertently even in the course of targeting genes that appear at first glance to be single copy . the challenge is to begin studying the range of phylogenetic signal such duplicate genes provide, to assess their evolutionary dynamics and potential signal for phylogenetics. within the butterflies, for instance, duplicate copies of opsin genes have been found both within and between families  <cit> , and our previous work suggested the possible utility of one of the opsins for phylogenetic purposes <cit> . the current work seeks to clarify the potential utility of an expanded collection of opsins for butterfly phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimation.

historically opsin genes have been advocated as phylogenetic markers, due to the amount of information we possess about their molecular evolution relative to other nuclear genes, and the wealth of cloned sequences available for a wide array of organisms  <cit> . in fact, the long wavelength-sensitive opsin gene  has routinely been used for the past  <dig> years in bee, bumblebee and wasp phylogenetic studies  <cit> , and has proven useful at both shallow  <cit>  and deep phylogenetic levels, suggesting its utility at resolving family level, cretaceous age insect divergences  <cit> . after gaining momentum as a phylogenetic marker, a second copy of the gene, lwrh <dig>  was subsequently discovered in bees, which fortunately appears to have evolved under a trajectory independent of the first copy, making both copies suitable for tree building  <cit> . currently there is little information about the potential use of other opsin genes in reconstructing insect phylogenies  <cit> , yet almost all insects that have been studied including butterflies have three clades of opsins that encode spectrally distinct visual pigments present in the adult compound eye that are ultraviolet- , blue-  and long wavelength -sensitive  <cit> . this suggests that other clades of opsins may also be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction over a similar range of divergence times.

butterflies are some of the best known organisms, possessing remarkable life histories and an uncanny beauty, but yet their most basal relationships have been until recently still obscure  <cit> . in the early days of butterfly evolution research, the study of the oldest butterfly lineages was intertwined with speculations about timing of their origins  <cit> . in more recent studies, the complexity of simply finding the most plausible topologies, and the difficulty of disentangling molecular evolutionary rates and divergence times, resulted in few studies directly concerned with timing the divergence of butterfly clades. concerns about the applicability of a molecular clock  <cit> , and the scarcity of butterfly fossils with which to calibrate it  <cit>  have also undoubtedly contributed to this paucity in the literature. in recent years the advent of both non-parametric and highly parametric bayesian  <cit>  methods that free the estimations of divergence times from the restrictions of a molecular clock and permit the incorporation of flexible fossil or biogeographical calibration points, has rekindled efforts to date the different diversification events within butterflies, and in the process sparked a controversy about when and where butterflies originated  <cit> . a generally young and scant record comprised of about  <dig> rhopaloceran fossils, a group which includes the skippers , nocturnal butterflies  and true dayflying butterflies , all found within the cenozoic era  and not older than 56– <dig> ma  and  <dig> ma , respectively  <cit> , has in of itself not been particularly useful in the direct estimation of the earliest butterfly divergences; and is considered by some researchers as a veritable indicator of a recent butterfly origin, dating back to the last epoch of the late cretaceous  or early cenozoic  no earlier than  <dig> ma ago  <cit> . on the other hand, molecular phylogenetic methods have produced much older divergence time estimates for several butterfly families, prompting many to ascribe the origin of butterflies to the diversification of angiosperms, between  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> .

another group of insects thought to have evolved concordantly with the early diversification of angiosperms are the ants  <cit> , but despite thorough sampling and an ample fossil record, disagreements concerning basal relationships and timing of the earliest divergences still exist  <cit> . in contrast, the basal relationships of butterflies are for the most part resolved, with our current understanding of relationships at the familial level being based on the study of wahlberg and collaborators, which employed both molecular and morphological data to resolve deep nodes in the phylogeny of butterflies  <cit> . therefore, with a known phylogeny, butterflies are a useful group of organisms for examining the impact of duplicate genes on phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimation.

in this study, we examine the effect of including duplicated opsin genes evolving at different rates on phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimates. we find that individual and combined analyses of the brh and lwrh genes are able to recover butterfly family-level relationships where previously morphological characters were required in addition to molecular  <cit> . we estimate divergence times for clades of high interest to the ecology and evolutionary biology communities, such as for the co-mimics heliconius erato and h. melpomene  <cit> , the migratory monarch danaus plexippus and the non-migratory queen d. gilippus  <cit>  and their co-mimics in the genus limenitis  <cit> . we find our estimates of family-level times of divergence with slower evolving gene duplicates to mostly be in agreement with other recent estimates found in the literature based on molecular data, and we push back the minimum age of divergence for the most basal butterfly family to  <dig> ma. our results suggest the potential utility of the opsins for resolving even older and more complex group relationships such as the moths.

RESULTS
relative rates tests classify duplicate brh and lwrh opsins functionally
as mentioned previously, most insects including butterflies have adult compound eyes that contain at least three classes of opsin genes  that encode visual pigments with wavelengths of peak absorbance, λmax, that fall roughly into the uv , blue  and long wavelength  portions of the light spectrum. within these broad partitions of the spectrum, the visual pigments of butterflies typically cluster in narrower ranges  . there are, however, additional opsins that evolved from these three basic classes in some butterfly eyes, which encode visual pigments with λmax values outside of these typical ranges .

all three basic classes of opsin  were present in all  <dig> butterfly species included in this study , except in the two closely-related satyrines, neominois ridingsii and oeneis chryxus, in which no brh gene could be found after exhaustive screening of head-specific cdnas. we think that these species probably do have blue-sensitive visual pigments in the eye based on physiological studies  but we were simply unsuccessful in retrieving them. similarly, we also think that besides the violet opsin we found in the pierid colias philodice this species likely has a blue-sensitive visual pigment in the eye based on electrophysiological studies of a related species  <cit>  but we did not find it. full-length coding regions were otherwise obtained for the opsin cdnas, including both start and stop codons. the size of these transcripts, including 3' and 5' utr regions ranged from 1137– <dig> bp , 996– <dig> bp , and 1143– <dig> bp . besides the three basic opsin classes, all lycaenid butterflies  and the pierid pieris rapae  <cit>  have duplicated blue opsins, representing two independent brh duplications, while the papilionids papilio xuthus and p. glaucus, the riodinid apodemia mormo and the moth bombyx mori possess duplicated lwrh opsins  <cit>  representing four independent gene duplications .

relative rates test showed that of the lycaenid blue opsin duplicates, brh <dig> evolved slower than brh <dig> in every one of the  <dig> lycaenid species sampled, although not significantly so . the slower rate of evolution of the brh <dig> opsin is consistent with our observation that this gene encodes the  <dig> nm visual pigment in lycaena rubidus, which is a wavelength of peak absorbance that is more typical of the "blue-sensitive" visual pigments in butterflies, than the duplicate brh <dig> gene in l. rubidus which encodes the unusually red-shifted  <dig> nm visual pigment  <cit> . similarly, in the pierid pieris rapae, the blue opsin copy , which encodes a  <dig> nm visual pigment  <cit>  evolved slower than the violet copy , which encodes a more unusual  <dig> nm pigment, but this result was not significant either. among the duplicated lwrh genes, significantly different rates of evolution were observed where bombyx mori lwrh <dig> evolved slower than b. mori lwrh <dig>  papilio lwrh <dig> evolved slower than both papilio lwrh <dig> and papilio lwrh <dig>  and apodemia mormo lwrh <dig> evolved slower than a. mormo lwrh <dig> . here too, the slowest evolving papilio lwrh <dig> encodes a pigment that with a λmax at  <dig> nm is functionally more similar to other butterfly long-wavelength sensitive visual pigments in its wavelength of peak absorbance than the pigment encoded by papilio lwrh <dig> , similarly, the slower evolving apodemia lwrh <dig> encodes a pigment that with a slightly blue-shifted λmax at  <dig> nm is much more typical of other butterfly pigments than its faster evolving lwrh <dig> copy that encodes a pigment with the highly atypical λmax at  <dig> nm  <cit> . given that the relative rates tests seem able to classify the slowest and fastest evolving gene copies in a way that also roughly reflected their function, with the slowest evolving copies having spectral properties falling in a more narrow, similar and presumably ancestral range than the fastest evolving copies, we decided to divide our data for further analysis  into alignments which included the slowest or fastest evolving copies.

p-values of gene pairs evolving at different rates are shown in bold.

for phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation, we also obtained ef- <dig> α and coi for individual taxa where such sequences were not already available in genbank. a total of  <dig> new gene sequences, including  <dig> opsin genes,  <dig> ef-1α and  <dig> coi sequences, are reported in this study . accession numbers for all new sequences and those downloaded from genbank are shown in additional file  <dig>  the combined data set consisted of a total of  <dig> bp, of which  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, belonged to the uvrh, brh, lwrh, ef-1α and coi genes respectively.

maximum parsimony analysis recovers a single tree for butterflies
maximum parsimony  analysis of all five genes using the slowest evolving opsin duplicates identified by the relative rates test resulted in a single tree  with a topology congruent with that inferred in a previous study from molecular and morphological data  <cit> . re-running this analysis using the faster evolving gene copies also revealed the same topology. as traditionally recognized, papilionidae is placed as sister to )). the relationships recovered within nymphalidae also correspond to the current consensus, which groups limenitidinae with heliconiinae and nymphalinae as sister to the previous two, satyrinae as sister to ) and danainae as the basal subfamily, sister to )). within lycaenidae, the theclinae clade, represented by the hairstreak satyrium behrii, groups together with the lycaeninae, and these two clades are sister to the polyommatinae.

dissecting the contribution of different genes to this topological hypothesis through partitioned analysis reveals that the lwrh gene provides the strongest support to the topology, followed by the brh, uvrh, ef-1α and coi genes . this holds true for both combined analyses which included slower and faster gene copies of duplicate genes. using the slower evolving copies we can see that both lwrh and brh support all nodes, as shown by positive partitioned bremer support values, whereas the information provided by uvrh, ef-1α and coi conflicts with one or more nodes. the uv opsin data strongly renders the grouping of both , and ) spurious, and also does not support the monophyly of satyrinae. ef-1α does not recover the  clade, but it does not take many steps to retrieve it . coi conflicts with  <dig> out of the  <dig> total nodes, resulting in many negative support values . this is not surprising since it has long been recognized that its fast rate of evolution renders coi of limited use when reconstructing phylogenetic history at levels deeper than species  <cit> .

values represent support as calculated using data sets containing slower/faster evolving gene copies. only one number is displayed when both analyses rendered the same value.

the bremer support values rendered by the analysis of the combined data set using faster evolving gene copies are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the values of the slower evolving copies in most cases . a few exceptions occur at basal nodes in the tree, where using the faster evolving copy of duplicated genes eliminates the support of the uvrh and coi genes for danainae as the most basal of the nymphalidae , the support of the brh gene for pieridae as sister group to ), the support of coi for the node consisting of vanessa + nymphalis , and adds the positive support of coi to papilionidae as sister to )) . however, these qualitative differences are not quantitatively important since the individual bremer support values for these gene partitions approach zero in both slow and fast gene copy analyses of these nodes.

one possible reason for the poor performance of the uvrh gene in our data set is that there may be duplicate copies, especially at deeper nodes in the phylogeny, which we have not yet identified in these species that are missing from our analysis. when searching for opsins by screening cdnas as we have done in the current study, it is difficult to know when to stop because there is far less functional data on the uv class of photoreceptor than either the blue or the long wavelength. this apparently messy result is interesting because it suggests we should continue to look harder. by contrast, for the brh and lwrh genes, we think we have identified all but one of the duplicates in the species represented and so this may have contributed to their striking performance .

maximum likelihood and bayesian phylogenetic analyses concur
to ensure that the good performance of the brh and lwrh opsins and the poorer performance of the uvrh opsin was not an artifact of the tree reconstruction method we also performed maximum likelihood  and bayesian analysis of the data. maximum likelihood and bayesian analysis of the lwrh data set as well as the all opsins, all nuclear, all genes data sets using slower and faster evolving opsin copies resulted in identical, strongly supported topologies  congruent with that obtained in our combined mp analyses , and with the inferred phylogenetic hypothesis of wahlberg et al. . the brh gene rendered a nearly identical topology, with the only exception being an unresolved node joining the nymphalid subfamilies satyrinae, nymphalinae and limenitidinae + heliconiinae . in contrast, the uvrh, ef-1α and coi genes rendered non-traditional groupings with various degrees of bootstrap support .

we also calculated using mrbayes a rate multiplier parameter  that reports relative substitution rate differences between partitions  <cit> , which can vary widely between genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  rates of change for opsin genes are intermediate between fast evolving coi and comparatively slow evolving ef-1α, which can account for the strong phylogenetic signal contained by the lwrh and brh genes at the hierarchical levels under examination in this study. on the other hand, the relatively lower performance of the uvrh is somewhat puzzling because its m falls in between that of the two other opsins.

interestingly, of all  <dig> gene duplications included in our data sets , only one results in different groupings depending on which copy is utilized. including brh <dig> in the analysis resulted in the grouping of satyrium behrii with the lycaeninae under both maximum likelihood  and bayesian analysis , whereas using brh <dig> creates either a polytomy of the three lycaenid subfamilies when employing ml , or the grouping of theclinae with polyommatinae under a bayesian framework .

wahlberg and wheat  <cit>  included a heat shock protein gene hsp <dig> in their initial study, and the resulting highly supported polyphyly of major lineages was blamed on the paralogy of heat shock protein genes. we note that it is highly likely that we would have had similar difficulties  with a less complete sampling of paralogous genes in the current study. such effects have been extensively documented elsewhere  <cit> .

regardless of the phylogenetic reconstruction method used, we found overwhelming support of a single phylogenetic hypothesis. both the lwrh and brh genes, as well as combined analyses of all opsin genes, all nuclear genes and all  <dig> genes rendered essentially the same tree topology, which also mirrors the current phylogenetic hypothesis for butterflies proposed by wahlberg et al.  <cit>  based on three genes  and  <dig> morphological characters. of the genes used in the above-mentioned study, ef-1α provided the strongest support to the topology, while coi the weakest . in their case, the addition of morphological data was crucial to elucidate many higher-level nodes, whereas in our study lwrh and brh individually and in combination with other genes was sufficient to achieve this goal.

divergence time estimates using duplicate gene copies are similar at shallow nodes
to estimate divergence times we used two different relaxed clock methods and the same calibration points on the phylogenetic hypothesis shown in figure  <dig>  first we employed a semi-parametric rate smoothing penalized likelihood method  <cit> , and second, we used a bayesian approach  <cit> . we note that this is the first study of butterfly divergence times employing both methods. for calibration we used two fossils as well as a biogeographic event to constrain three nodes. the most recent common ancestors of vanessa cardui and nymphalis antiopa , and of pieris rapae and colias philodice  were constrained to a minimum age of  <dig> mya based on the florissant fossils vanessa amerindica  <cit>  and stolopsyche libytheoides  <cit> , respectively, whereas the split between the neartic papilio glaucus and the paleartic p. xuthus  was constrained between  <dig> and  <dig> mya, based on the breakage of the super continent laurasia  <cit> .

under the bayesian approach, three priors also need to be established, namely, the age of the root , the rate of evolution in substitutions per site per million years, and the variation of the rate of evolution over time, also called brownmean  <cit> . we selected  <dig> and  <dig> ma as priors for the age of the ingroup node to reflect recent competing hypotheses for the origin of butterflies. our  <dig> ma prior follows the hypothesis of early butterfly diversification near the cretaceous/tertiary boundary , and the  <dig> ma prior reflects a conservative approach to a second hypothesis locating this event sometime in the cretaceous, roughly following the early diversification of angiosperms  <dig> mya  <cit> . both the mass extinction of terrestrial vertebrates following the impact of a large meteor off the yucatan peninsula in mexico defining the k/t boundary, and the rise of the angiosperms as dominant terrestrial plants had enormous evolutionary consequences, providing likely scenarios for the origin and diversification of insect taxa.

in general penalized likelihood  reported older estimates than bayesian analyses , and the older the node the larger the difference between estimates obtained through the two methods and between estimates calculated using the slower and faster copies of duplicated genes. this is especially dramatic when we compare the estimates for when the oldest butterfly family, papilionidae, is inferred to have first appeared . the penalized likelihood estimate using the slower evolving gene duplicates is much older  than the penalized likelihood estimate using the fast evolving gene copy  , and both estimates are together older than those obtained using the bayesian method,  <dig> – <dig>  mya  for the slower evolving copies vs.  <dig> – <dig>  mya for the faster evolving copies. it is important to note that the use of the three shallow level calibration points available under the restrictions of our data set constitutes a likely source of variation in our divergence time estimates, especially at deep nodes very distant in time from the calibrated nodes  <cit> , so all of these estimates should be viewed with caution .

estimates were calculated using combined data sets including slow and fast evolving opsin copies. these results were obtained using a prior distribution for the age of the ingroup node  of either  <dig>  or  <dig>  ma, a rate of evolution of  <dig>  substitutions per site per million years and brownmean value of  <dig> .

the bayesian analyses performed on combined data sets containing slower evolving copies of duplicated genes rendered younger estimates, and therefore more conservative estimates than the analyses of combined data sets including faster evolving gene copies or the analyses using penalized likelihood . since the effect of the priors employed in the analyses is small, and the choice of a root age of  <dig> and  <dig> ma did not seem to have much of an impact on divergence dates  the rest of this discussion will be based on the divergence times estimated using the slower evolving copies, our preferred rate and brownmean priors  and our most conservative root age prior of  <dig> ma .

our results indicate that the papilionidae diverged from the ancestor of all the other butterfly families combined sometime between  <dig> – <dig>  mya  using the slowest evolving copies of duplicated genes . these results are compatible with other studies focused on divergences of younger lineages within the family. zakharov and collaborators suggest for instance the ancestor of papilio diverged from the tribe troidini up to  <dig> mya  <cit>  while braby et al.,  <cit>  propose a minimum age of  <dig> ma for the first diversification within troidini. we also note that two other studies  <cit>  using similar calibration constraints as our study, timed the major divergences within the papilionid genus papilio as occurring around  <dig>   and  <dig>   mya, respectively, which is comparable with our estimated divergence of the lineages leading to p. glaucus and p. xuthus between  <dig> – <dig>  mya .

we estimate the split of pieridae, the next oldest butterfly lineage to have evolved, from the ancestor of ) to be situated between  <dig> – <dig>  mya , a result consistent with wheat et al.  <cit>  who estimated this split to have occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> mya. similarly, braby et al.,   <cit>  estimated the subtribes pierina and aporiina to have diverged  <dig> mya, and from this result extrapolated an average age for the crown group of the pieridae of  <dig> ma . at the subfamily level, our results situate the split between pierinae and coliadinae  in the pieridae between  <dig> – <dig>  mya, which is consistent with the results of wheat et al.,   <cit> , who, using distance methods on the ef-1α and coi genes alone, estimate this divergence is between  <dig> and  <dig> mya.

for the youngest butterfly families, the most recent common ancestor of nymphalidae and  , is located by our analyses at a minimum age between  <dig> – <dig>  ma, and the split between lycaenidae and riodinidae  at  <dig> – <dig>  mya. estimates for the origins of subfamilies within the lycaenidae  and nymphalidae  are shown in table  <dig>  wahlberg   <cit>  suggests that the nymphalid subfamily nymphalinae was already present the cretaceous/tertiary boundary,  <dig> mya. in our data set, the first split within nymphalinae  occurs between  <dig> – <dig>  mya, which is concordant with wahlberg's estimate. we note too that peña and wahlberg   <cit>  estimated the split between satyrinae and the closely related subfamily calinaginae , to have occurred  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya. though not directly comparable, this result is compatible with our estimated age  <dig> – <dig>  mya for the divergence of satyrinae from its more distantly related subfamilies ).

on the other hand, monteiro and pierce , using a mitochondrial gene molecular clock estimated the origin of the satyrine genus bicyclus between  <dig> and  <dig> mya, and the split of the subtribe to which it belongs  from the subtribe to which coenonympha belongs  at roughly  <dig> mya . this last estimate is much younger than our estimation for the split between bicyclus and ) which we find between  <dig> – <dig>  mya . this discrepancy may be partly due to the currently unresolved polytomies that plague the satyrini tribe  <cit> .

the only divergence time estimate existent for species in the widely studied nymphalid genus danaus, to which the famed monarch butterfly belongs , corresponds to the divergence between the sister species d. plexippus and d. erippus, which based on molecular clock estimates are suggested to have split about  <dig> mya  <cit> . our analyses situate the split between the less closely related d. plexippus and the queen butterfly d. gilippus, between 15– <dig> mya . as expected based on its position in the butterfly phylogeny, the scientifically conspicuous danainae originated prior to the limenitidinae , which contains the palatable species limenitis archippus, co-mimic of both the monarch and queen butterflies. we estimated the divergence between the north american l. archippus archippus and l. arthemis astyanax , to have occurred between  <dig> – <dig>  mya. this result conflicts with a previous estimate of the colonization of the nearctic by the genus limenitis, situated at about  <dig> mya by a molecular clock calculation but recognized by the author to be based on a crude divergence rate percentage  <cit> , but is compatible with the postulated laurasian origin of the genus limenitis and the bering land bridges that connected asia with north america in the late miocene   <cit> .

another taxon famous for its astounding mimicry complexes is the nymphalid genus heliconius, for which, surprisingly, only two estimates of divergence times exist in the literature; for intraspecific or more-closely related species in heliconius than those included in our study. based on arthropod mitochondrial gene evolution rates, brower found the first split within h. erato and h. melpomene to have occurred between  <dig>  and  <dig> mya  <cit> , whereas kronforst  <cit> , using the same method, dated the split between the closely related heliconius melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades, which excludes h. erato, at  <dig>  mya. our study includes h. melpomene and h. erato, members of branches representative of the first divergence within the genus, and estimates their split between  <dig> – <dig>  mya .

did butterflies diversify in the age of angiosperms?
butterflies are phytophagous feeders as adults and larvae on the flowering plants or angiosperms. using all fossil evidence, including leaves, flowers, wood and pollen, the major angiosperm radiation is estimated to have occurred 90– <dig> mya   <cit> . in light of this information, the molecular timescale estimates we have presented that seem most reasonable for the butterflies are the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals for the slow evolving data set . considering the lower bounds, our data suggest that diversification of the lineages leading to the five butterfly families was completed sometime after the angiosperm radiation, ~ <dig> mya.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest the use of lwrh and brh opsins in resolving both lower and higher level phylogenetic relationships in butterflies and suggest they may help to resolve relationships and divergence times estimates between even larger and more complex groups such as the moths. one possible reason for the unusually good performance of lwrh and brh opsins may be due to the fact that we sampled highly expressed transcripts, which may bias the sample towards copies that for structural reasons are evolving under independent trajectories. it is very likely that if we had targeted genomic dna, then we would have been more likely to pick up the kinds of duplicate opsin genes that are to be avoided for phylogenetic purposes, e.g., tandemly repeated copies undergoing gene conversion.

another possibility is in the way we have handled this data. we propose that phylogenomic studies might usefully include duplicate gene copies for phylogenetic analysis if relative rates tests are first used to identify slow and fast evolving copies. in our data set where the spectral properties of some of the visual pigments encoded by duplicate copies are known, this simple procedure brought together a collection of genes in the slow category whose ancestral function has been retained and whose patterns of molecular evolution may have been conducive to phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence times estimation. even for genes where no functional information is known a similar procedure may help, though of course this suggestion would best be implemented after further validation using genes with a range of other functions besides the visual pigments.

as several previous studies on butterfly family and subfamily divergence times have suggested, so too do our results support an origin of butterflies older than the  <dig> ma advocated by vane-wright  <cit>  and others, regardless of the absence of butterfly fossils older than eocene ages. the present study, using a set of genes that includes opsins, which have not been used previously in butterfly divergence time estimations, reaches the same conclusion: the origin of butterflies surpasses with ample margin the cretaceous/tertiary boundary by at least  <dig> ma.
