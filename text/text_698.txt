BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  constitute one of the largest and most ancient super-families of integral trans-membrane receptor proteins that act as cellular receptors and play a central role in the signal transduction in eukaryotes  <cit> . they are perhaps the most versatile of all the known proteins in the human genome  <cit>  and hence are the focus of intense pharmaceutical and academic research  <cit>  as they form one of the prime transduction pathways through which acceptance of a signal by a cell can principally occur, the other being tyrosine kinase receptors  <cit> . abnormalities in cell signaling by gpcrs are the root cause of wide-spread disorders like asthma, peptic ulcers, hypertension, type ii diabetes etc.  <cit> . gpcrs have triumphed throughout the course of evolution and can probably be traced back to a time before the divergence of plants and animals  <cit>  and possibly even exist in protozoa, though not characterized, yet  <cit> . their importance can be gauged from their presence as well as abundance in almost all eukaryotic genomes  <cit> .

the availability of complete sets of putative members of a family from diverse species provides the basis for cross-genome comparative studies. the japanese pufferfish, takifugu rubripes, having a genome that is one-eighth the size of that found in human, is among the smallest vertebrate genomes and thus an apt reference for annotating the human genome. teleosts diverged about  <dig> million years ago from other phyla and are ancestors of tetrapods. comparing the genomes of fugu and the green spotted pufferfish , it is observed that about 75% of the duplication events appear to have happened before the takifugu and tetraodon lineages separated  <cit> . both these teleost species serve as model genomes but are non-redundant since the two, being separated by approximately  <dig> to  <dig> million years, provide an improved annotation on both sides.

we have classified the gpcrs present in the takifugu rubripes genome according to the grafs classification system and compared it to gpcrs present in the human, chicken and the tetraodon nigroviridis genomes, which has added to the information of gpcr evolution alongside vertebrate evolution  and detected very high orthology between fugu-human and fugu-chicken. additionally we also compared the gpcrs between the japanese and the green spotted pufferfish for perspective and found that the two pufferfishes had comparable receptors in this superfamily of proteins.

RESULTS
our primary objective was to classify the gpcrs of the fugu  genome according to the grafs classification system  <cit> , that were available with the non-redundant public databases of ncbi  <cit>  and uniprotkb  <cit>   and from previously published literature  <cit> , as the majority of gpcrs in all eukaryotes, starting from the nematodes in the evolutionary ladder, can be categorized in lieu of the grafs system . we also compared the gpcrs between the two puffer fishes to understand the pattern of evolution among teleosts that has been characterized according to grafs  <cit> .

fugu comprises fewer gpcrs than either human and chicken . also our dataset has  <dig> gpcrs less than that reported in tetraodon nigroviridis <cit> . except for  <dig> fugu receptors, all others find matches in the human gpcrs, while all but  <dig> find counterparts in the chicken gpcr sub-set. all fugu gpcrs found orthologs in tetraodon nigroviridis though, unlike fugu, most tetraodon gpcr sequences in the public databases still did not have a clearly defined function. we observed that there are some unique receptors in fugu which are not present in humans like the pheromone receptors, while some are conspicuous with their absence in fugu, such as the melanocortin <dig>  receptors which are found in human.  <dig> fugu receptors did not confirm to the requirements of the grafs classification and hence were grouped under the other 7tms. for better understanding and clarity in viewing the phylogenetic tree, we grouped the families as rhodopsins and non-rhodopsins . a very high orthology was detected between the receptors of chicken and human when compared to those in fugu , keeping with the attribute of fugu as a reference model for the human genome. also all fugu gpcrs found counterparts in tetraodon nigroviridis , though the orphans could not be compared between the sub-families as this detail was not found for tetraodon nigroviridis.

non-rhodopsins
glutamate 
adhesion 
the adhesion sub-family is known to have immunological functions as well as plays important roles in the central nervous system  <cit> . they are unique in comprising of certain motifs, rich in glycosylation sites and proline residues, occurring in the long  n-termini, that are likely-players in cell adhesion  <cit> . this family has been referred to by many other names due to some other unique characteristics, for instance, it has been called egf-tm <dig> to emphasise the presence of epidermal growth factors  domains in its n-termini, ln-tm <dig> receptors, due to its long variable n-termini, as already mentioned above, and also termed b <dig> due to their distant similarity with secretin receptors  <cit> . only two adhesion receptors could be detected in fugu from the sequence dataset collected. both corresponded to the ig-hepta/gpr <dig> that is found in the chicken and human datasets of gpcrs, while  <dig> receptors were grouped in to this family for tetraodon nigroviridis. no gpcrs corresponding to the bai, celsr, emr, etl, he <dig> and lec sub-families were found for fugu in the public databases.

cd <dig> belongs to the b family of g protein-coupled receptors . subfamily b <dig> contains cell surface molecules with long extracellular n-termini . they are putative cell-surface signaling molecules induced in the activated leukocytes and are highly expressed in regions of inflammation , besides being expressed in smooth muscle cells and malignant tumors  <cit> . these receptors are present in tetraodon and human but lack orthologs in fugu and chicken, and were probably lost in the lineage leading to chicken.

frizzled/taste  <dig> 
the frizzled/taste  <dig> sub-family are a comparatively recent addition to the gpcr family, which mediate signals from the secreted glycoproteins, thus controlling cell fate, polarity and proliferation during metazoan development  <cit> . they are receptors having  <dig> amino acid long n-termini with conserved cysteine residues that are expressed in the tongue and palate epithelium and probably act as bitter taste receptors, though their function is not quite clear.

this sub-family is one of the most highly-conserved among all gpcrs found in flies, fish and mammals, indicating an evolutionary pattern far-removed from the other gpcr families. in comparison to the  <dig> frizzled receptors of fugu, the human gpcr repertoire has  <dig>  while the count reaches  <dig> in the chicken sub-set. tetraodon has been reported to have  <dig> frizzled/ smoothened/ tas <dig> gpcrs.

the taste  <dig> gpcrs, which seem to have arisen much later, being conspicuously absent in flies, roundworm  and fugu , have a considerable representation in the mouse and human gpcr sub-sets and a sole member in zebra-fish. in fact, this is one of the only two receptor types  that have arisen after the split of tunicates from the lineage leading to the vertebrates. this receptor-type is not well-conserved; in fact they are among those that have evolved most rapidly in the past 100- <dig> million years in mammals.

secretin 
secretin is one of the sub-families  that appeared on the grafs classification system by the splitting of class b of the a-f system. the secretins were found to be descendents of the adhesion family  <cit>  and has structural similarity with the latter in their trans-membrane regions. the secretin receptors comprise of at least six highly conserved cysteine bridges in their n-termini and bind to large peptide ligands like hormones and neuropeptides  <cit> . they are well represented in all vertebrates as well as in tunicates, fruitfly and nematodes. they are gastro-intestinal hormones that regulate the ion  and enzyme secretion from the pancreas. in fugu, the secretin sub-family comprises of  <dig> calcitonin receptors ,  <dig> corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor ,  <dig> growth hormone-releasing hormone ,  <dig> pituitary adeylate cyclase-activating peptide ,  <dig> parathyroid hormone receptors  and  <dig> vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors , bringing it to a total of  <dig>  while in human and chicken there are  <dig> and  <dig> of these gpcrs, respectively. tetraodon has  <dig> secretin receptors with at least 73% sequence similarity with the fugu secretin receptors. the secretin and the viprs are thought to share a common ancestor, with secretin receptors appearing approximately  <dig> million years ago either due to gene duplication or from a glucagon ligand.

rhodopsins 
the rhodopsins constitute the largest chunk  of the fugu gpcr repertoire, comprising of  <dig> receptors, keeping with the trend in numbers seen in the gpcr repertoires of all vertebrates. rhodopsins in the grafs system correspond to the class a of the a-f classification system. this is the first family of gpcrs whose three dimensional structure was determined, thus serving as the foundation of structural studies for the understanding of these special proteins. the rhodopsins have a structure that is different from adhesion, frizzled, secretin and majority of the glutamate receptors, as the rhodopsins have short n-termini, unlike the others mentioned. the rhodopsin binding cavity seems to be between the trans-membrane regions in contrast to the other gpcr families where the n-terminal plays the pivotal role in ligand-binding, though the ligand-binding domain of luteinizing hormone , follicle stimulating hormone , leucine-rich-repeat containing gpcr  and thyrotropin stimulating hormone  receptors of the δ sub-family lie in the n-termini  <cit>  .

the rhodopsin family is systematically categorized in to  <dig> groups based on experimental phylogenetic investigations: α, β, γ and δ <cit> .

α–rhodopsins 
the α-group includes  <dig> amine receptors,  <dig> opsins and  <dig> members of the meca cluster in the fugu gpcr dataset. there are a total of  <dig> α-rhodopsins in human while  <dig> of these are present in chicken and  <dig> in tetraodon nigroviridis. some α-rhodopsin sub-groups like the melanocortin  and endothelial differentiation g-protein coupled receptors  are very well-conserved. all but  <dig> out of the  <dig> fugu mc receptors have one-to-one orthology with the human and chicken sub-sets, and both the edgr receptors found exact matches in both human and chicken. the mc receptors  arose early in the evolution of vertebrates, still displaying a remarkable conservation in their sequences, especially in the binding and activation domains  <cit> . except the mc <dig> receptors, which fugu lacks, its mc receptors have evident similarities with those found in mammals, especially in their pharmacological characters which indicates that they bind to melanocortin peptides with high potency and respond well in their presence, thus playing essential roles in pigmentation regulation, energy homeostasis and the production of steroids  <cit> . fugu also lacks both prostaglandin and melatonin receptors of the α-subfamily but has  <dig> receptors each in the serotonin and dopamine subgroups,  <dig> muscarinic,  <dig> trace amines and  <dig> adrenergic receptors, all displaying one-to-one orthology with the human and chicken gpcrs. fugu contains a total of  <dig> opsins:  <dig> rod pigments,  <dig> cone visual pigments,  <dig> encephalopsins/tmt  opsins and no peropsins, melanopsins and retinal g-protein receptors. the meca  cluster contains the highest number  of receptors in the rhodopsin family, out of which the majority  are mc receptors.

β-rhodopsins 
though this group has no main branches, it consists of  <dig> peptide-binding receptors of  <dig> different types. in the fugu gpcr repertoire, this family is constituted by  <dig> neuropeptide y ,  <dig> neuropeptide ,  <dig> endothelin-related receptors ,  <dig> arginine-vasopressin receptors  and  <dig> tachykinin receptors , but no hypocretin receptors , cholecystokinin receptors , gastrin-releasing peptide receptors , neuromedin b receptors , uterinbombesin receptors , neurotensin receptors , growth hormone secretagogues receptor , neuromedin receptors , thyrotropin releasing hormone receptors , ghrelins, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptors , oxytocins or orphans. the human and chicken gpcr sub-sets have  <dig> and  <dig> β-rhodopsin receptors respectively, as compared to the  <dig> detected in fugu and  <dig> in tetraodon nigroviridis. all of the  <dig> fugu npy receptors show orthology with the human and chicken npy receptors. fugu has representatives of y <dig>  y <dig> , y <dig>  y <dig> and yy receptors types in this sub-class. the y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and the proposed y <dig> receptors that are found in mammalian gpcr repertoires were not detected in the fugu data-set. this sub-class gets its name from the fact that all npy receptors bind with high affinity to the npy and pyy peptides .

γ-rhodopsins 
this classification contains receptors that bind to both peptides and lipid-like compounds. the γ-rhodopsins of fugu comprise of  <dig> receptors  and are divided in to three main branches, namely- sog , melanin-concentrating hormone  and the chemokine receptor clusters. in fugu,  <dig> sog were detected out which  <dig> were classified as neuropeptide galanin & the rf-amide binding receptor galr and the remaining  <dig> as somatostatin receptors . opioids, which are receptors that are targeted for treating cough, pain and alcoholism, were not detected in fugu. two mch receptors were detected in the fugu gpcr repertoire, with representatives in both the mch <dig> and mch <dig> types, as in the case seen in mammals, though the latter seems to have been lost in chicken. the chemokine receptor cluster is an interesting group in this sub-class pertaining to their role in acute and chronic inflammation. only one drug  has received regulatory approval that targets a chemokine called ccr <dig>  which are used as co-receptors by some hiv strains during viral entry. in fugu,  <dig> classic chemokines have been detected that comprise interleukin  <dig> receptors type i and ii.

δ-rhodopsins 
the final group of the rhodopsin sub-family is the δ-rhodopsins that have four main branches of mas-related, glycoprotein, purine and the olfactory receptors clusters. in the fugu gpcr dataset, the olfactory receptors form the major chunk of this sub-class, including  <dig> out of the  <dig> total δ-rhodopsins, in comparison to the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> such receptors found in tetraodon nigroviridis, human and chicken, respectively. the remaining four receptors are representatives of the lhcgr  and the  <dig> members of the relaxin-binding receptor sub-groups. the classic glycoprotein receptor hormones of lhcgr, fshr and the tshrs are members of the glycoprotein receptor sub-group which have been targets of recombinant peptides in different gpcr studies  <cit> .out of the  <dig> olfactory receptors in fugu,  <dig> belong to the odorant receptors, while the human genome has  <dig> functional odorant receptors  <cit> ,  <dig> such representatives are found in chicken and  <dig> odorant candidate receptors in the tetraodon nigroviridis gpcr repertoire. other than the same <dig> odorant receptors of the fugu δ-rhodopsins, all other members were orthologous to the human and gpcr sub-sets. in fact, these were the only  <dig> receptors which did not have any human orthologs. the orphan gpcrs in tetraodon nigroviridis could not be compared to those in fugu as they were not grouped under any sub-families, unlike the latter. the high variability in the number of odorant genes in pisces indicates species-specific adaptation suited to bind to important receptors important to the specific species  <cit> . six fugu olfactory receptors could not be classified under any sub-category and hence, were placed under other olfactory receptors.

the rapidly evolving class of olfactory gpcrs express themselves in the olfactory epithelium, with the help of which pisces, aves and mammals are known to detect the chemicals in their external environment. olfactory receptors, on the basis of phylogenetic criteria  <cit> , can broadly be categorized as those which recognize water-soluble odorants , and those that mediate air-borne smells . fishes use their olfactory system to detect pheromones for discriminating between toxins, predators, prey and mates, foraging, detecting nests and staying with their own school. since majority of fishes lead a totally aquatic life, without ever leaving the water, they have no use for the class ii olfactory receptors. an olfactory receptor may bind to a diverse set of odorants and bring about activation. this may be the reason that as compared to fishes, mammals, especially humans, have an enormous number of odorant receptors of both the class i and class ii types to enable them to discriminate between a plethora of smells. the characterization of these receptors would be of great impact and could be capitalized upon by the fragrance industry, though not so much as drug targets as they are yet to be implicated in the occurrence of any disease.

the two pufferfishes, fugu and tetraodon nigroviridis, have coding regions with approximately 87% similarity and both are considered model systems for studying human gpcrs  <cit> . fugu and tetraodon nigroviridis are separated by  <dig> to  <dig> million years that might add to the differences in their gene sequences. on account of its small size, availability and easier maintenance conditions, tetraodon nigroviridis was the species of choice over fugu initially. but following the first draft of the fugu genome, revealing the huge similarity observed in three-fourth of fugu proteins with that of humans, the comparability of their gene repertoire  was established and fugu was accepted as a model system. the differences between the two pufferfishes might be due the fact that the two fishes differ in their natural habitat and thus have different environmental conditions to adapt to. but the study of both these systems adds to the annotation of both these species and is non-redundant.

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic analysis of gpcrs in the model system of fugu helps to establish the position of fishes in the vertebrate evolution. the fugu genome is one of the smallest vertebrate genomes that lack the repetitive sequences observed in genomes of higher organisms. it serves as a valuable reference set for studying other protein families in the human genome. we believe that a thorough understanding of the similarities and uniqueness of gpcrs among different genomes is vital before using them as drug targets. moreover, such evolutionary studies with representatives of key vertebrate classes will help in identifying prime functional residues and motifs to elucidate the role of gpcrs in vertebrate evolution.
