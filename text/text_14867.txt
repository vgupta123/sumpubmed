BACKGROUND
epilepsy is a common neurological disease in both human and dog. epilepsy is defined as recurrent, self-limited and unprovoked seizures, and can be classified according to the age of onset, the localization of seizure origin , and aetiology. epileptic seizures can be caused by trauma or structural abnormalities of the brain, or by metabolic disorders. the cause may also be directly genetic or idiopathic   <cit> . it affects approximately one to five percent of the human and canine populations, although it can be five to  <dig> times more common in some dog breeds  <cit> .

many human forms of epilepsy are considered to have a genetic basis though little is known about the underlying risk genes and variants for common forms of epilepsy despite increasingly powerful methodologies  <cit> . rare mendelian forms of the human disease have been associated with many ion channel subunits, although other types of gene pathways, related to neurodevelopment, mitochondria, and other cellular processes, are now being identified  <cit> .

the high prevalence of epilepsy in many dog breeds suggests a strong genetic contribution  <cit>  and could provide complementary resources to identify risk genes. human and canine epilepsies share features, suggesting shared biological aetiologies. indeed, several orthologues have been found in canine symptomatic recessively-inherited epilepsies . however, only two genes have been associated with ie to date: lgi <dig> in benign juvenile epilepsy in lagotto romagnolos  <cit> , and the adam <dig> risk locus in the belgian shepherd ie  <cit> . although a genetic predisposition has been postulated in many breeds  <cit> , the identification of risk genes has been challenging. reasons include clinical and genetic heterogeneity and may relate to incomplete phenotyping, underpowered study cohorts, or incomplete resolution of the dna marker panels.

in addition to the lgi <dig> mutation  <cit> , the rare breakthrough in canine ie comes from genetic studies in the belgian shepherd breed. the first microsatellite-based approach suggested six loci on cfas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . genome-wide significance was later confirmed only at cfa <dig> by a low density genome-wide association study  and finemapping with roughly  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls  <cit> . a seven-fold epilepsy risk was found with the homozygous risk haplotype in the adam <dig> locus  <cit> . to confirm these earlier findings and to identify possible novel epilepsy loci, we re-genotyped a larger cohort of belgian shepherds with the latest high density single-nucleotide polymorphism  arrays and included three other breeds with ie: finnish spitz, schipperke and beagle. we report a shared risk in the four breeds and identify a common risk haplotype in the adam <dig> gene by targeted resequencing and validation. this study emphasises the role of adam <dig> in canine epilepsy, and proposes a role for the lgi-adam pathway in epilepsy across species.

RESULTS
epilepsy phenotypes
the seizure characteristics of idiopathic epilepsy in the studied breeds were described based on the detailed epilepsy questionnaire collected from the epileptic dogs in each breed. the seizure characteristics of belgian shepherds and finnish spitz have been described recently  <cit>  and are summarised for schipperkes and beagles in additional file 1: results. the defining characteristics of idiopathic epilepsy in the four breeds are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  briefly, ie in the four breeds show typical onset at early adulthood at three years of age  and manifest both focal and generalised seizures. a high variability in seizure frequency is present in all breeds ranging from one reported episode in two years to several episodes per month. no evidence for sex predisposition was found in belgian shepherds or schipperkes, but more affected males are reported in beagles  <cit>  and finnish spitz  <cit> .

in addition to the questionnaire reports on seizure history, clinical examinations that included complete neurological exam, blood chemistry, cerebrospinal fluid  analyses, magnetic resonance imaging  and electroencephalography  were also performed in a selected group of dogs from three of the breeds to exclude possible external causes of seizures. none of the exams revealed abnormalities, whereas the eeg detected epileptic activity in some of the dogs supporting the diagnosis of ie. the clinical summaries of the finnish spitz and belgian shepherd examinations have been reported previously  <cit> . the clinical results of  <dig> epileptic and five healthy control schipperkes are presented in additional file 1: results. clinical studies were not performed for beagles.

breed-specific association studies
a total of  <dig> dogs in the four breeds were genotyped with the high-density snp arrays. they formed distinct genetic populations according to the multidimensional scaling  plot drawn from the two top principal components of genetic variation . in belgian shepherds with two breed variants groenendael  and tervueren ,  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls passed the diagnostic and genotype quality control criteria. this cohort is largely new having only 16 % overlap with our previous study that used the lower density arrays  <cit> . the breed variants are closely related but represent separate clusters in the mds plot . the genomic inflation factor λ was  <dig> . gwas analysis revealed only one genome-widely significant locus, confirming the previously identified association on cfa <dig> at  <dig> – <dig>  mb with the best associated snp bicf2p <dig> at 15111724 bp  .

the schipperke cohort with 67 ie cases and  <dig> controls formed a single population in the mds plot analysis  as expected since the majority of the dogs came from one large pedigree . despite correcting for the relatedness using mixed model approach, no significant association was revealed in the gwas . the genomic inflation factor λ was  <dig> .

the finnish spitz cohort including  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls, clustered together in the mds plot . gwas did not reveal any significant association . the genomic inflation factor λ was  <dig> .

the beagle cohort consisted of 29 ie cases and  <dig> controls and represented two clearly separate genetic populations in the mds plot . the beagle samples originated from finland , germany  and sweden . most of the finnish dogs clustered separately from the german dogs, although some overlap was present. three finnish and four swedish beagles clustered together with the german beagles, and three swedish beagles clustered together with the finnish beagles. the majority of the finnish beagles belonged to the finnish hunting line, which has been maintained separately from other beagles to maintain the hunting skills. the two genetic subpopulations seen in the mds plot represent this population substructure . gwas revealed no significant association in beagles , even in an independent analysis of the german and finnish hunting lines . the genomic inflation factor λ was  <dig> .

across breed gwas
the gwas data from the four breeds were analysed jointly for possible common risk variants. an intronic snp bicf2p <dig> in the adam <dig> gene on cfa <dig> at 15111724 bp showed the strongest association signal  . when the combined data were analysed without belgian shepherds, another intronic snp in the adam <dig> gene showed strong association  . these results suggest a shared risk locus exists across the four breeds.fig.  <dig> genome-wide association study across four breeds and gene content of the associated locus on cfa <dig>  a. genome-wide association study including belgian shepherds, schipperkes, finnish spitz, and beagles highlights a single locus on cfa <dig>  the snps showing the strongest association with ie are located in the adam <dig> gene. the red line indicates genome-wide significance level of p-values. b. the ucsc-based gene content of the  <dig>  mb critical region on cfa <dig>  which was targeted and resequenced. the figure also includes the genotyped hd markers in the locus and annotation gaps in the canfam <dig>  reference



targeted resequencing of the adam <dig> locus in belgian shepherds
our two gwas experiments in belgian shepherds  support the strongest association within the adam <dig> gene. therefore, we selected the two highest associated risk variants within adam <dig> to define the risk haplotype for 12 ie cases and  <dig> controls with opposite homozygous haplotypes. a  <dig>  mb region spanning adam <dig> was captured and resequenced. resequencing data of cfa <dig> was of high quality with an average 100x sequence coverage in each sample in the target region . in total, 5934– <dig> single-nucleotide variants  and 2922– <dig> insertion-deletion variants  were identified in each dog .

however, only  <dig> variants showed opposite genotypes in the risk and non-risk haplotypes, including  <dig> snvs and eight indels unique to all  <dig> cases. these  <dig> variants cover a 96 kb interval within adam <dig> . these variants included one coding variant  that was identified in our previous sanger sequencing experiment and was used to define the risk haplotype  <cit> . all the other variants identified were intronic to adam <dig> with  <dig> known variants from dbsnp.

validation reveals a shared six-variant risk haplotype across breeds
we prioritised  <dig> of the  <dig> variants discovered in resequencing for a validation in a larger cohort using conservation scores in the public databases  . these  <dig> variants included one coding variant  and  <dig> intronic variants in adam <dig>  in addition, we added a second coding variant , which is rare in belgian shepherds, but was detected in sequencing samples from other breeds in our previous study   <cit> . adam <dig> intronic variant bicf2p <dig>  was included in the validation, as it showed the strongest association signal in the combined gwas without belgian shepherds. in total,  <dig> variants were genotyped in  <dig> dogs across four breeds . one variant appeared monomorphic  and was excluded from further analyses.

the genotyping data was analysed for association in individual breeds and all breeds combined. we found that the coding variant  was associated with ie in belgian shepherds  and finnish hunting beagles , but not in german beagles , schipperkes  or finnish spitz  . the second coding variant  was associated with ie in schipperkes  and finnish spitzs , but not in finnish  or german beagles , or belgian shepherds . the minor allele  frequency was only  <dig>  in belgian shepherds .

a majority of the intronic snps showed significant associations in individual breeds . in the combined analysis of all four breeds, intronic variants both upstream and downstream of exon  <dig> showed strong association with the lowest p-value at 15113325 bp  .fig.  <dig> the variants identified in the resequencing and associated with idiopathic epilepsy are located in adam <dig>  a. the  <dig> case-specific variants identified in belgian shepherds by targeted resequencing were located within a 39-kb region of adam <dig> and span exons 5– <dig> highlighted with blue. the entire adam <dig> region spanning  <dig> ,211– <dig> ,391 bp on cfa <dig> based on the ucsc genome browser on dog . thirteen illumina hd markers are within the adam <dig> gene, and four within the 39-kb region. there is a gap in the reference sequence in the 5’ end adam <dig>  and the exon  <dig> sequence has high gc content. b. association results of the  <dig> variants at the target region on cfa <dig> in belgian shepherds, schipperkes, finnish spitzs, beagles , and combined data. the coding variants at  <dig> and 15113940 bp show inconsistent association between the breeds. c. there is strong linkage disequilibrium in the adam <dig> gene region in the four associated breeds:  belgian shepherds,  schipperkes,  finnish spitzs and  hunting beagles from finland. the most consistent association across breeds was identified for a six-variant risk haplotype spanning a 28-kb region containing exons 5– <dig> outlined with black



haplotype analysis using haploview indicated a strong linkage disequilibrium between the  <dig> variants  defining a risk haplotype that spanned almost the whole genotyped region  in each breed. the risk haplotypes were similar but not identical across breeds. breed-wise comparisons revealed a shared 28-kb six-variant risk haplotype  encompassing the exons 5– <dig> of adam <dig> between  <dig> and 15113325 bp . dogs homozygous for the risk haplotype had the highest risk of epilepsy with or varying from  <dig>  to  <dig> across associated  breeds . for the four breeds having a significant risk haplotype, fewer than 10 % of cases did not carry that risk haplotype.table  <dig> haplotype analysis revealed a common risk haplotype for idiopathic epilepsy. a risk haplotype shared between the breeds was identified between  <dig> and 15113325 bp on cfa <dig>  it consisted of alleles t-c-del-del-g-g at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 15113325 bp in adam23

uncovering the missing upstream sequence for adam23
in the absence of a compelling causative variant in the coding region of adam <dig>  we hypothesised that the variant was in the regulatory region of the gene. however, the dog reference sequence  has a gap of unknown size in the regulatory region upstream of exon  <dig> of the adam <dig> gene . additionally, the sequence in the 5’ end of the adam <dig> gene, including exon  <dig>  is highly gc-rich , challenging conventional mutation screening. for example, there is a 6-bp sequence  repeated seven times immediately upstream of exon  <dig> . to enable efficient study of this 5’ regulatory region, we aimed to fill the gap using a bac clone from the target region and pacbio sequencing technology. we found a 190-bp gc-rich  sequence with simple repetitive elements that has expanded the canine reference sequence for this gene . this 5’ region upstream of exon  <dig> could not be included in the capture design and while exon  <dig> was included in the design, it did not work in the capture experiment, possibly due to the very high gc-content of the region .

discussion
this study significantly expands from our previous ie studies in belgian shepherds  <cit>  to achieve four major goals. first, we sought to confirm the association at cfa <dig> and possibly reveal other loci by replicating our original low resolution study using high resolution gwas in a larger independent cohort. second, we assessed three other ie breeds  with reasonable sample size by gwas to map new ie loci. third, we undertook a combined analysis of the data for the four breeds to identify shared ie loci. finally, we aimed to refine the associated region and identify causative variants by targeted resequencing.

our findings provide strong genetic evidence for the role of adam <dig> in canine ie. the belgian shepherd data with increased resolution and sample size confirmed the association to adam <dig> on cfa <dig> but did not reveal new loci at a genome-wide significant level. a combined analysis of the three other breeds using high resolution gwas also highlighted the adam <dig> gene though breed-specific associations were not revealed. our previous attempt to demonstrate the adam <dig> locus involvement in those breeds  <cit>  failed because the selected snps were uninformative to detect association in these breeds. our targeted resequencing of the large  <dig>  mb locus uncovered a set of new case-specific variants found only in the adam <dig> gene, and a replication study with those variants revealed a strongly associated shared risk haplotype in all four breeds. the 28-kb risk haplotype consisting of intronic variants lies in the middle of the adam <dig> gene. these results implicate adam <dig> in ie and suggest that the causative variant  yet to be found resides within the risk haplotype or adjacent to the gene outside the coding regions. the two missense variants affecting the r <dig> amino acid in exon  <dig> of the adam <dig> gene show conflicting association in the studied breeds suggesting this is not the causal mutation. the sequence gap at the 5’ region of adam <dig> and poor resequencing coverage in the gc-rich exon  <dig> did not permit definitive assessment of the 5’ regulatory region of the gene. we did however, uncover the 190 bp sequence gap immediately upstream of adam <dig> in a bac clone. this will help the future characterization of the role of the 5’ regulatory region in canine ie.

while most affected dogs carried the risk haplotype, it was also commonly found in control dogs with frequencies of  <dig>  to  <dig>  depending on the breed. these results suggest a low penetrance of the seizure predisposing variant in adam <dig>  the high frequency of the risk haplotype combined with low penetrance may partly explain why ie is so common in many dog breeds despite active prevention efforts in the breeding programs. accurate estimation of penetrance may be adversely affected by imperfect diagnosis of mild cases that are now in the control group. identification of the causative variant  will permit more precise estimations in future experiments.

adam <dig> is an excellent candidate gene for ie. it interacts with known ie genes, lgi <dig> and lgi <dig>  <cit> . a truncating mutation in the lgi <dig> gene prevents its secretion in neurons and causes recessively inherited benign juvenile epilepsy in the lagotto romagnolo breed  <cit> . lgi <dig> is a paralog of lgi <dig> which is the causal gene for adtle/adpeaf , a non-remitting epilepsy in humans with onset typically in adolescence or early adulthood  <cit> . both lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> are neuronally secreted proteins  <cit> , and interact with adam neuronal membrane proteins, such as adam <dig>  adam <dig>  and adam <dig>   <cit> . adam <dig> is expressed in the central nervous system, and high expression levels have been detected in the cerebral cortex pyramidal cells and in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, as well as in the cerebellar purkinje cells  <cit> . adam <dig> is the primary receptor for lgi <dig>  and needed for lgi1-mediated dendritic branching  <cit> . the function of the adam23-lgi <dig> complexes is currently being studied.

a complete knockout of adam <dig> in mice results in ataxia, tonic-clonic seizures, failure to thrive and death within two weeks from birth  <cit> . heterozygous mice appear otherwise normal but have a lower seizure threshold  <cit> . a reduction in the adam23-mediated lgi1-stimulation of neurite outgrowth in the central nervous system was suggested to contribute to epilepsy, although other yet unknown adam-lgi-mediated alterations may exist  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our genetic data implicates adam <dig> as a common risk gene for idiopathic epilepsy in four unrelated dog breeds and further replication studies in additional breeds are ongoing. our data suggest causal variation with low penetrance in the regulatory region of the gene. the identification of the causal variation  and further functional studies are warranted to improve the understanding of the adam23-mediated molecular mechanisms in the brain and their role in seizure susceptibility.
