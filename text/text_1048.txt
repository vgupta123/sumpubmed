BACKGROUND
sugarcane is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions and is primarily grown for sugar production accounting for about 75% of the world’s sucrose supply. it is clonally propagated and has a very high photosynthetic efficiency which makes it very attractive as a source of biomass
 <cit> . recently it has become more important as a biofuel crop for the production of ethanol
 <cit> . it is a perennial grass, a member of the poaceae family and andropogoneae tribe, which includes maize and sorghum. cultivated sugarcane is derived from inter-specific hybridisation between, in the main, two polyploid species s. officinarum l. and s. spontaneum l which have different basic chromosome numbers. the resultant cultivars are complex aneu-polyploids with chromosome numbers of 2n = 100- <dig>  in the production of modern cultivars derived from the initial hybrid, the 2n transmission that occurs from s. officinarum in the primary cross has been used to advantage. backcrossing to s. officinarum or other cultivars recovers the high sugar phenotype inherited from s. officinarum while retaining the disease resistance and good ratooning of the wild s. spontaneum parent. the preferential outbreeding, highly heterozygous and predominantly autopolyploid genetics of sugarcane are all factors that have hindered the development of a comprehensive genetic map.

classic cytological studies using in situ hybridization have determined that s. officinarum is an octaploid  with a basic chromosome number of  <dig>  the same as its closest known diploid relative sorghum
 <cit> . s. spontaneum has varying ploidy levels  but has a basic chromosome number of x = 8
 <cit> . genome in situ hybridisation has determined that commercial cultivars contain approximately 80% s. officinarum chromosomes, 10-15% s. spontaneum chromosomes and approximately 10% recombinant chromosomes
 <cit> . q <dig> is an australian cultivar no longer grown commercially. it has  <dig> chromosomes of which 82- <dig>  are inherited from s. officinarum, 15- <dig>  are inherited from s. spontaneum and 11- <dig>  are recombinant chromosomes
 <cit> . these are similar in the proportions found in most varieties studied to date
 <cit> .

sugarcane has a large genome 
 <cit>  and in the absence of a genome sequence, a high-density genetic map is a valuable tool to understand the genetic and genomic organisation of this complex polyploid crop. its autopolyploid nature with mostly random pairing plus high inbreeding depression has limited the production of more common experimental mapping populations such as double haploids or recombinant inbred lines. the complication of the coexistence of single dose  and multi dose alleles and irregular chromosome numbers in the various homology classes due to aneuploidy has restricted genetic mapping. with the realisation that sd markers can be used to generate genetic maps in polyploids
 <cit>  genetic maps were developed in sugarcane using a population of full-sib  individuals 
 <cit>  with sd markers segregating 1: <dig> or by using a population created by selfing an individual and mapping sd markers segregating 3: <dig>  initially mapping was carried out in the ancestral species s. spontaneum and s. officinarum <cit> . more recently cultivars of hybrid origin have been mapped
. all of the genetic maps that have been generated for sugarcane to date have had low genome coverage and limited information on genome organisation. one of the main reasons for this has been the limited number of markers mapped. in most cases fewer than  <dig> have been mapped due to the complexity of marker generation in such a complex polyploidy and the high cost of generation of large numbers of mappable markers. many markers of different dosage are generated in sugarcane but segregation of markers of greater than double dose in the 200- <dig> size populations means that accuracy of marker placement is low
 <cit> .

the development of diversity array technology 
 <cit>  for sugarcane has combined the low-cost high-throughput properties of the dna microarray platform with the ability to identify various types of dna polymorphisms
 <cit> .

this paper reports the generation of a comprehensive sugarcane genetic map of q <dig>  an australian sugarcane incorporating  <dig> markers generated from dart, amplified fragment length polymorphism , simple sequence repeats , single nucleotide polymorphism , restriction fragment length polymorphism  and random amplified polymorphism  markers. this large number of markers allowed the majority of the lgs to be placed into the  <dig> homology groups which is consistent with the basic chromosome number of the ancestral species s. spontaneum and the lowest basic chromosome number identified in the saccharum genus.

RESULTS
generation of mapping data
to generate the maximum number of polymorphic markers using the sugarcane dart array, the dna from each of the f <dig> progeny was digested with several different restriction enzyme combinations. dna from each combination was then screened separately across the sugarcane dart array
 <cit> . using these separately screened enzyme combinations, a higher number of polymorphic markers was generated. in total  <dig> markers were scored as present/absent of which  <dig> were generated from a psti/bstni digest,  <dig> from a psti/hpaii digest and  <dig> from a psti/taqi digest. of the  <dig> dart markers generated  <dig> were identified by more than one enzyme digest and had the same segregation pattern. the remaining  <dig> unique markers included  <dig>  which were sd and used to generate the linkage map. psti/bstni generated  <dig>  sd markers, psti/hpaii generated  <dig>  and psti/taqi generated  <dig> .

in total  <dig> markers were scored. of these,  <dig> were ssr markers of which  <dig> were sd,  <dig> aflp markers of which  <dig> were sd,  <dig> snp markers of which  <dig> were sd,  <dig> rapd markers of which  <dig> were sd; and  <dig> were rflp markers of which  <dig> were sd . the majority of the segregating markers inherited from q <dig> were sd, and segregating 1: <dig>  in the population .table  <dig>

genetic map construction
the genetic map was constructed using  <dig> progeny generated from a cross between q <dig> an old australian cultivar and ij76- <dig> a s. officinarum accession using the pseudo testcross approach. of the  <dig> markers scored that were present in q <dig> and absent in ij76- <dig>   <dig>  were sd in q <dig>  the majority of sd markers were dart, aflp and ssr markers although  <dig> est snp markers were also scored in this population . of the  <dig> sd markers used for mapping,  <dig> were present in and used to generate the map reported in
 <cit> . although the markers were selected as sd markers segregating 1: <dig> in the progeny a chi square value was used that allowed inclusion of sd markers with moderate segregation distortion  but excluded likely double dose markers as in
 <cit> , as it is well known that segregation distortion is common in plants. the percentage of skewed markers varied from homology group  to hg with 18% of markers skewed in hg <dig> and  <dig> % of markers skewed in hg <dig> . initially for map construction, only the markers that were present in greater than  <dig> progeny were used to generate a framework map. a number of the dart markers  were only scored in  <dig> individuals, and these markers were added to the map after initial map construction using markers scored across the whole population. the  <dig> sd markers formed  <dig> linkage groups containing  <dig> markers, leaving  <dig>  unlinked markers .figure  <dig>

assembly of saccharum homologous groups 
as sugarcane is an autopolyploid it contains many copies of each chromosome. in order to determine the genome structure of q <dig> the linkage groups  were placed into hgs using a number of different strategies. firstly using the multi-allelic loci detected by single ssr, rflp or snp markers, secondly using sequence information from these markers and thirdly using repulsion phase analysis. the majority of the multi-allelic markers were from ssrs but a major problem encountered with the ssr markers was that only 47% of the  <dig> ssrs derived from sugarcane that were screened across the map, were specific to one homology group. thirty-five of the ssrs had only one sd segregating marker and  <dig>  mapped to more than one homology group. for the  <dig> ssrs derived from sorghum that were mapped, only  <dig>  were specific to one homology group and the majority  only generated one sd marker. nevertheless, of the  <dig> linkage groups formed,  <dig>  could be placed into hgs. these hgs contained from  <dig> to  <dig> lgs, with the lgs varying in length from  <dig>  cm , to  <dig>  cm  . coverage within the homology groups varied from hg <dig> with a total map length of 1818 cm to hg <dig> with a total map length of  <dig>  cm . hg  <dig> also had the most markers mapped with  <dig> markers compared to hg <dig> which contained the least number of markers at  <dig> .

chromosome pairing within hgs
to determine whether there is preferential pairing behaviour within q <dig> we examined linkage in repulsion of each marker with all other markers in the map. a total of  <dig> lgs were linked in repulsion with other lgs. the amount of repulsion detected varied between hgs, with hg <dig> having  <dig> lgs  linked in repulsion compared to hg <dig> where no repulsion was detected . in the hgs where repulsion was detected, the number of lgs involved varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  out of the  <dig> lgs linked in repulsion,  <dig> pairs of lgs were only found in repulsion to each other. the other  <dig> lgs were in repulsion with more than one other lg. this indicated that in most cases there was preference in pairing between a small number of lgs. a difference ratio was calculated to compare how the genetic distances of the lgs within a hg varied between hgs
 <cit> . one high coverage lg was selected per hg to compare to all other lgs within the same hg . the average difference ratio varied from  <dig>  for hg <dig> to  <dig>  for hg <dig> table  <dig>

intrachromosomal rearrangements within the homology groups
hg1
hg <dig> contained  <dig> lgs which were grouped using  <dig> multi-allelic ssrs and  <dig> multi- allelic snp markers. all of these multi-allelic markers were only mapped in hg1; there was only one allele from an ssr that mapped to another hg . in general the lgs within the hg were syntenic to each other with the order of the markers highly conserved. only hg1lg <dig> appeared to have a change in marker order at the end of the lg compared to other lgs within the hg with markers between m77i and m8a inverted.

hg2
this was one of the largest hgs with a total of  <dig> markers and the longest total length of 1818 cm . there were  <dig> multi-allelic markers with a range of alleles from  <dig> to  <dig> in this hg. combined with the sequence information from markers with known sequence this produced a high coverage hg. the order of markers for the lower coverage linkage groups was fairly consistent with minor order changes probably as a result of missing data. there were five lgs  with extensive rearrangements which appear to be recombinant lgs. these chromosomes are on average 52% longer than the rest of the lgs within this hg. this hg group contains the largest number of lgs and from the ssr markers there are two distinct sets of smaller lgs that align to these larger lgs. one set of lgs containing ssrs msscir  <dig>  msmc <dig>  msscir  <dig>  msmc  <dig> and msscir  <dig> and the other set of lgs containing msscir <dig>  msmc <dig>  msscir  <dig>  msc <dig>  this indicates that this hg is composed of s. spontaneum chromosomes aligned to two sets of s. officinarum chromosomes in agreement with the basic chromosome number of these progenitor species.

hg3
hg <dig> contained  <dig> markers with a total length of  <dig>  cm and an average distance of  <dig>  cm between markers. this hg contained  <dig> lgs which were aligned with  <dig> multi-allelic ssrs and snp markers . the overall order of markers was largely consistent between lgs.

hg4
hg <dig> contained a total of  <dig> markers covering  <dig>  cm which gave an average distance of  <dig>  cm between markers . this hg contained  <dig> lgs assigned to the hg group using  <dig> multi-allelic markers with three densely mapped lgs and a number of smaller lgs. marker order was maintained across the majority of linkage groups although some changes were seen. for example msc <dig> on hg4lg <dig> was in a different position relative to hg4lg <dig> 

hg5
hg <dig> contained  <dig> markers that covered a distance of  <dig>  cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between markers . this group contained  <dig> lgs assigned to the hg with  <dig> multi-allelic markers. the lgs ranged from  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers to  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers.

hg6
hg <dig> contained  <dig> markers on  <dig> lgs which covered  <dig>  cm with an average distance between markers of  <dig>  cm . this hg contained  <dig> multi-allelic markers and in general the marker order was consistent between lgs. hg6lg <dig> contained  <dig> markers at the end of the linkage group that also aligned to hg <dig>  this appears to be a translocation between the two hgs. there is a 10 cm gap between the groups of markers but the groups were formed at a lod of  <dig> giving strong evidence that the linkage is real .

hg7
hg <dig> contained  <dig> markers which covered  <dig>  cm with an average distance between markers of 5 cm. this hg consisted of  <dig> lgs. again there were fewer multi-allelic markers but from the  <dig> that were present in the group the marker order was consistent between lgs .

hg8
hg <dig> contained  <dig> loci which covered  <dig>  cm giving an average of  <dig>  cm between markers. this homology group contained  <dig> lgs formed using  <dig> multi-allelic markers. this hg contained a larger number of low coverage lgs but in general marker order was consistent between lgs .

comparison to the r <dig> genetic linkage map
using common ssr markers, this current q <dig> map can be partially aligned to the r <dig> genetic map
 <cit> . for most of the hgs in the q <dig> map each hg aligns to a single hg in the r <dig> map
 <cit>  . the major difference was that hg <dig> in the q <dig> genetic map was missing in the r <dig> genetic map. there were only  <dig> ssrs in common between the q <dig> hg <dig> and the r <dig> map and in all  <dig> cases, alleles from these ssrs mapped to two hgs. the ssrs markers msscir <dig> and msscir <dig> mapped to both hg <dig> and  <dig> in the q <dig> map and to hg vi in r570; the latter aligns to hg <dig> in the q <dig> map. the third marker  mapped to hg <dig> and  <dig> in the q <dig> map and mapped to hgi in the r <dig> map; hg <dig> aligns to hg <dig> in the q <dig> map. these incongruous markers could be explained by the mapping of duplicate loci in the two different cultivars which are polymorphic at different loci. multi allelic markers that map to more than one locus can create problems for the assignment of lgs to hgs in sugarcane, but it is also possible that in a complex polyploid like sugarcane there are differences in chromosome composition between cultivars. multi-locus markers are common in sugarcane; in the present study 22% of the ssrs mapped in q <dig> mapped to two different loci. this phenomenon has also been observed in diploids

discussion
sugarcane dart markers
this is the first sugarcane genetic map published which contains dart markers and our results demonstrate that sugarcane dart markers are of high quality and can be used to substantially enhance an existing genetic linkage map. the dart markers generated here integrated into the existing linkage map, demonstrating that they behave in a mendelian manner. there was a higher level of redundancy observed for the dart markers than for any of the other marker types but the dart array used in this study was not filtered for redundancy. in total, 50% of the dart markers were clustered within 10 cm regions across the genetic map but the location of these clusters corresponded with the location of clusters of other types of markers. this has been seen in previous dart genetic maps for sorghum and oat
 <cit> . these high density clusters could correspond to the centromeric regions of chromosomes where large physical distances correspond to small genetic distances, a feature that has been seen before in sorghum
 <cit> . in sorghum, the closest diploid relative of sugarcane, the pericentromeric heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes have been shown to have much lower rates of recombination  compared to euchromatic regions 
 <cit> . it is also possible that some clusters represent additional regions where chromosomal rearrangements have occurred or where there is introgression from s. spontaneum causing a higher frequency of polymorphism and hence mapped markers.

q <dig> genetic map
this genetic map is a substantial improvement on previously published maps with more than twice as many markers compared to any other sugarcane genetic map. the high number of markers of known sequence contributed by the dart, est-ssr, and snps, allowed the majority of the lgs  to be condensed into eight hgs that align to the basic chromosome number of s. spontaneum <cit> . the  <dig> lgs had a cumulative map length of  <dig>  cm and an average marker density of  <dig>  cm. this current linkage map increased the total map length by  <dig>  cm and decreased the average marker density from  <dig>  cm in the previous q <dig> map
 <cit>  to  <dig>  cm. it is known from cytogenetic analysis that q <dig> has  <dig> chromosomes
 <cit> . in this study, the number of lgs greatly exceeds this number of chromosomes although  <dig> of the lgs are small with  <dig> or fewer markers . this result gives an indication of the uneven coverage of markers across the genetic map which has been seen in all of the current published maps, whether generated from selfed populations
 <cit>  or bi-parental crosses
 <cit> . sugarcane cultivars have over  <dig> chromosomes and are all derived from an initial hybrid between the two different species, s. spontaneum and s. officinarum followed by backcrossing to the high sugar s. officinarum or other cultivars. as a result, the background s. officinarum part of the genome has lower levels of polymorphism than the s. spontaneum part of the genome. in addition, it is well documented that 2n transmission of chromosomes occurs in interspecific crosses of sugarcane
 <cit> . the introgressed s. spontaneum parts of the genome are the polymorphic regions and in part are responsible for the high density marker areas of the map. the high polyploidy of sugarcane means only a proportion of the markers that are polymorphic can be mapped. any regions or marker alleles present at greater than two doses can not be accurately mapped with the present population size. the resulting q <dig> map has the largest number of markers of any sugarcane linkage map published to date, with  <dig> markers mapped across the genome, more than doubling the previous number of markers. however, this still only generates an average of  <dig> markers per chromosome.

marker order
marker order was in good agreement between lgs within hg <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . inconsistencies were observed in groups of markers that were closely linked. inversion is a common feature of closely spaced markers
 <cit>  and could be real, or due to error, or could be explained by the statistical uncertainty of orders at the cm-scale that is inherent in large data sets. in contrast, marker order in hg <dig> and  <dig> was less consistent and could be explained by the fact these two groups contain translocated chromosomes. hg <dig> and  <dig> also appear to have simple translocations with marker order mostly maintained between lgs within a hg. translocations have been identified in other polyploids; including wheat, an allopolyploid which has the well documented translocations between 4a, 5a and 7b
 <cit> .

chromosome pairing
in total, repulsion was detected between  <dig>  linkage groups, similar to the level detected in r <dig> where  <dig> lgs  were involved in preferential pairing
 <cit> . analysis of all pairing frequencies determined that complete disomic behaviour was not present, rather the lgs preferentially paired and often within groups of  <dig> or  <dig> lgs. a cytogenetic study of q <dig> demonstrated that its chromosomal make-up is 15- <dig>  s. spontaneum chromosomes, 11- <dig>  recombinant chromosomes
 <cit>  and 82- <dig>  s. officinarum chromosomes. in total, q <dig> contains 26- <dig> chromosomes with complete or partial s. spontaneum origin which is a similar number to the  <dig> lg identified with preferential pairing in this study. it is possible that the lgs displaying preferential pairing are the ones that are inherited from s. spontaneum. to determine how similar lgs were within a homology group, a difference ratio in genetic distance was calculated between lgs within a hg where marker intervals were shared
 <cit> . the number of shared intervals varied between hgs and the accuracy of the difference ratio is probably higher in hg1- <dig> due to the larger numbers of shared intervals . combining this information with the preferential pairing results  showed that hg <dig> had an average difference ratio of  <dig>  and no preferential pairing, whilst hg <dig> had a ratio of  <dig>  with  <dig> lgs involved in pairing. there was a positive correlation between the difference ratio and the percent of lgs detected in repulsion within a hg  with an r2 =  <dig> . the results indicate that within a hg group, as expected, there are two sets of lgs, each likely to be inherited from a different species. furthermore, the hgs where these two sets of chromosomes are more distinct, for example hg <dig>  showed more preferential pairing within and not between the two sets of lgs. in contrast, for hg <dig> where the lgs are more similar to each other, there is no preferential pairing.

comparison to r570
the majority of the q <dig> hgs could be aligned with the r <dig> hgs using a total of  <dig> allelic makers from  <dig> ssrs . the q <dig> map forms  <dig> hgs aligning to the basic chromosome number of s. spontaneum. in the case of hgs  <dig> and  <dig> for q <dig> and viii and vi in r <dig> there appear to be more lgs than in the other hgs
 <cit>  table 
 <dig>  this could be because two sets of s. officinarum chromosomes are aligned with one set of s. spontaneum chromosomes which are the result of simple fusion
 <cit> . this was first indicated in the r <dig> rflp map
 <cit>  and verified in the more recent genetic map
 <cit> . the r <dig> map is formed into  <dig> hgs and when aligned to the q <dig> map appears to be missing hg <dig>  hg <dig> in the q <dig> map has  <dig> multi-allelic ssr and snp markers and an additional  <dig> single snp markers. from the location of the ssr markers smc <dig> and sm <dig>  hg <dig> appears to contain a translocation from hg <dig>  it is possible that the r <dig> map lacks this hg <dig> because these duplicated ssrs have lead to the mis-assembly of sets of homologous lgs into the same hg
 <cit> . it is likely that there will be complex structural differences between the basic chromosome sets of s. officinarum and s. spontaneum which may have lead to misassembly of hgs in both the r <dig> and q <dig> maps. in the q <dig> map there appears to be at least  <dig> lgs  with this same translocation providing strong evidence for its existence .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that sugarcane dart markers provide high quality markers that can be used to construct sd genetic maps in polyploid sugarcane. the high numbers of dart markers generated in a single assay which are distributed over the whole genome offers a real advantage for a range of molecular breeding and genomics applications. as sugarcane cultivars have approximately 100- <dig> chromosomes, large numbers of markers are needed to generate a useful genetic map. the highly parallel and automated platforms used in dart generation mean that the cost per data point is very low. the  <dig> markers in this genetic map allowed 92% of the lgs to be placed into  <dig> hgs conforming to the basic chromosome number of the ancestral species, s. spontaneum. the large number of ssr markers on this genetic map provides the opportunity for the first time to compare genetic maps derived from different sugarcane cultivars. the cross-compatible markers used to generate the map provide the basis for further studies of comparative structural genomics within cultivated sugarcane varieties and within the saccharum genus. the use of dart markers will allow the development of consensus genetic maps in sugarcane which would improve genome coverage and allow integration with other genomic resources. a high coverage genetic map is essential for the correct assembly of the sugarcane genome sequence which a number of research groups are generating.
