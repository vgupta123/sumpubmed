BACKGROUND
forest trees constitute over 80% of terrestrial biomass and harbour more than 50% of terrestrial biodiversity providing wood material and fundamental ecosystem services for humans including preservation of biodiversity, carbon cycling, climate regulation and preservation of water quality and soils  <cit> . understanding the genomic basis of adaptation and architecture of complex phenotypic traits is needed for development of diagnostic tools for the conservation, restoration and management of natural populations and for genetic improvement programmes  <cit> . understanding plant adaptation is also one of the main interests of evolutionary biology. so far however, knowledge of the mutations, genes and biochemical pathways involved in species evolution and underlying phenotypic and adaptive variation remain scarce mostly due to a lack of efficient methods for accessing the polymorphisms at the whole genome scale. recent advances in cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing technologies provide new tools for development of genomic resources with huge potential for downstream applications in virtually any species. in particular, these next-generation sequencing  methods provide a unique opportunity to advance studies of non-model plants, including economically important trees with complex genomes such as conifers  <cit> .

here, we focus on a group of four closely related european pines: scots pine  and the three taxa comprising the p. mugo complex including p. mugo turra , p. uncinata ramond  and p. uliginosa neumann . these species differ from each other in phenotype, total population size, geographical distribution and ecology, in particular for traits related to dehydrative stress and temperature  <cit> . pinus sylvestris is one of the most ecologically and economically important forest tree species in the world and has the largest distribution of all pines, being found from western scotland to eastern siberia and from turkey and spain north to the arctic circle. it is locally adapted to environmental conditions related to photoperiod and temperature and shows clinal latitudinal variation in timing of bud set and cold hardiness  <cit> . pinus mugo is a high-altitude polycormic european pine of up to a few meters in height, which forms shrub populations above the tree line in the mountainous regions of central and southeastern europe. pinus uncinata and p. uliginosa are trees of up to 20 m height; the former is a forest forming component in the high mountains of western europe, the latter is adapted to peatbogs in lowland areas of central europe.

despite clear morphological and ecological differentiation, analysis of nuclear genes showed that the species share a similar genetic background, indicating recent divergence  <cit> . however, despite significant inter- and intra-specific gene flow during historical range shifts, local adaptation to highly contrasting environments has occurred  <cit> . the species are not completely reproductively isolated, can occur and hybridize in sympatry and have the same number of chromosomes . considering their genetic similarity, but distinctive phenotypes , geographical ranges  and ecology  the species comprise a promising system for study of the genomic basis of adaptation and the genetic architecture of phenotypic traits. taking advantage of the system for comparative studies requires development of a comprehensive array of genomic resources and methods addressing variation at the whole genome scale.

for large and complex genomes, transcriptome sequencing is an attractive alternative to whole genome sequencing, and yields a comparatively high content of functional information from coding regions. by constructing a comparative analysis within a phylogenetic framework we aimed to develop genomic resources relevant to molecular evolution in the genes and gene complexes underlying inter- and intra-specific variation in this important group of tree species.

RESULTS
characteristics of the transcript sequence
comparative studies of closely related species can advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of adaptive traits. for many species these studies have been seriously limited by a lack of genomic resources from which to develop genetic markers for topics such as species divergence, adaptation and demographic processes in natural populations. in our study we applied illumina sequencing for successful de novo transcriptome characterisation and development of new genomic resources in a complex of four pine species from across the species distribution range in europe . from each insert of the cdna library, 2 × 100 bp independent reads can be obtained using illumina paired-end sequencing technology. our results show that this highly cost and time efficient technology is a very useful and reliable tool for transcriptome characterization, gene discovery and marker development, even for species with large and complex genomes. sequencing of the reference scots pine sample  used for de novo transcriptome assembly produced a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw 100 bp sequencing reads. raw assembly of the reads produced over  <dig>  contigs greater than 100 bp that contained over  <dig> × 106 bp . after a series of filtering steps including searches for orf sequences those contigs were aligned into  <dig> unigenes. retrotransposons comprise a substantial proportion of most plant genomes and they can be transcriptionally active. however, we found less than  <dig> % of the unigenes contained such sequences, which is lower than has been found in other plants and pine species. for instance, in the pinus contorta transcriptome, about 6% of contigs represented retrotransposon-like sequences  <cit> . the low number of retrotransposon sequences may also result from our strict filtering criteria, in which many low quality sequences were discarded before alignment. in our dataset,  <dig> contigs were identified as putative retrotransposon sequences and they were discarded providing a final set of  <dig> high quality unigenes  and a total reference transcriptome of  <dig> ,267 bp .figure  <dig>

lack of a reference genome prevented us from estimating the number of genes and transcript coverage for the focal species. however, 48% of the unigenes matched known proteins, providing large set of target genes representing various metabolic pathways. the functions of unigenes covered a broad range of gene ontology categories that were assigned to  <dig> unique genes with blast matches to known proteins. there were a total of  <dig> gene ontology terms associated with those genes. based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway  <dig> unigenes  had significant matches in the database and were assigned to  <dig> pathways.  <dig> of the unigenes that had enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to  <dig> enzyme pathways. based on biological processes the most numerous contigs were classified as related to metabolism  and regulation of biological processes . the function of about 43% of the unigenes was related to binding activity. about 78% of all unigenes were classified as intracellular or membrane components . the number of assigned contigs was similar to studies in p. contorta, when about  <dig> unique genes were found across  <dig> contigs developed using a  <dig> gs xlr <dig> titanium pyrosequencer  <cit> . from the published gene numbers for pinus taeda  and other conifer species  <cit>  we estimate that we have identified around half of the total number of scots pine genes. considering that the focal species are known to be highly diverged for adaptive traits, polymorphisms in the genes belonging to metabolic and regulation pathways are likely to be particularly useful for searching for the genetic basis of quantitative trait variation and local adaptation.figure  <dig>

marker development
the focal pine species are evolutionarily closely related  <cit>  but differ in ecology, geographical distribution and population size. therefore, they form a very attractive model for studies of the genetic basis of local adaptation and speciation. so far, genetic studies of the species  have focused on assessments of quantitative trait variation and underlying qtls  <cit> , genetic structure, demography and selection  <cit> . these studies were mostly based on microsatellite loci and/or sequence variation at candidate genes and consequently their conclusions were limited by the low number and resolution of markers or genomic regions. several qtls for phenology and polymorphism due to natural selection at a few candidate genes related to stress response were found for scots pine  <cit> . recent studies have also provided nucleotide polymorphism information for p. mugo based on amplicon sequencing and candidate gene studies  <cit> . however, no genomic resources currently exist for this group of pine species to address fundamental questions about the genetic basis of adaptation and divergence. our study makes a large proportion of the functional variation in coding regions of the genome available for downstream research with the use of high throughput genotyping platforms. in our dataset, the  <dig> samples of the four pine species sequenced in lower depth produced a total of ~ <dig> ×  <dig> reads with their number varying between 30– <dig> ×  <dig> per sample . the vast majority of all reads for each sample  were successfully mapped to the reference transcriptome sequence of the scottish pinus sylvestris sample from glen tanar . compared to the reference, from ~ <dig> ×  <dig>  to ~ <dig> ×  <dig> snps  were called for each sample . snps were found in 54-59% of all unigenes including  <dig> unigenes with snps identified for p. sylvestris,  <dig> for p. mugo,  <dig> for p. uncinata and  <dig> for p. uliginosa. filtering of all available snps from merged contigs across the species that were at least 50 bp apart from each other provided a set of  <dig>  snps . the availability of cost and time efficient genotyping methods for snps using next-generation sequencing platforms will certainly advance comparative genomic and population genetic studies of these species. the resources could also be useful in breeding and silviculture, through marker-assisted and genomic selection approaches  <cit> , for genetic improvement of phenotypic traits of economic and ecological importance, especially in scots pine.table  <dig>

nucleotide polymorphism and genetic relationships between species
the samples from which transcriptome data were generated were collected across broad environmental gradients, throughout the species distribution range. despite clear differences in range and total population sizes, we observed very similar levels of nucleotide polymorphism in each species. comparing among species, and across the whole transcriptome, most snps were found in p. mugo  relative to the reference. this species showed much greater similarity to the other two taxa from the p. mugo complex than to p. sylvestris, as evident from the higher proportion of common  and lower proportion of unique snps  between the p. mugo complex taxa as compared to p. sylvestris  . all four species showed similar levels of nucleotide polymorphism  and an excess of low frequency variation  . our estimates of total nucleotide polymorphism were very similar to estimates obtained from much smaller candidate gene datasets  <cit> . in our study nearly half of the transcriptome sequences were monomorphic across species. overall, the species showed a high level of genetic similarity marked by similar proportions of reads from different species that mapped to the reference scots pine transcriptome and many shared snps segregating between species. our study provides evidence for closer genetic relationships between p. mugo and p. uliginosa as compared to p. sylvestris . pinus uncinata also showed a closer relationship to the taxa from the p. mugo complex  except for one outlier sample from spain that showed closer genetic similarity to p. sylvestris. this individual may represent an admixed genotype of both species as cryptic hybrids between p. uncinata and p. sylvestris were described in spain in morphological and molecular studies  <cit> . no significant genetic differentiation  was found between p. mugo and p. uncinata vs. p. uliginosa . our results are in line with previous evolutionary assessments in these species that showed high genetic identity between the taxa from the p. mugo complex and outgroup scots pine. the close genetic similarity between taxa  but high divergence makes them a very promising system for comparative genomic studies. searches for loci of high divergence against the genetic background of the focal taxa will help to identify regions under selection, which have played a role in adaptation and speciation.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we provide a reference transcriptome sequence for scots pine, a conifer tree species of great ecological and economic importance in the world. we annotated the transcriptome in reference to many genes and metabolic pathways described in open access databases.

putting our study in a phylogenetic framework we provide novel genomic resources comprising a publicly-available database of snp markers for a set of four closely related pine species. information about nucleotide polymorphism in coding regions will facilitate genotyping, population genetic and association studies to better understand the genetic basis of plant adaptation and speciation.

our study shows the largest genetic divergence between p. mugo and p. sylvestris. despite large differences in distribution range and total population size, all species showed very similar patterns of nucleotide polymorphism.

our results demonstrate the high relevance of illumina technology for de novo assembly, transcriptome characterization and marker discovery in a species with large and complex genomes, which lack draft genome sequence information.
