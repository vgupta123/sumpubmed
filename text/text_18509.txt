BACKGROUND
rhodopsin is an abundantly expressed gene specifically found in rods, and its expression is primarily regulated at the level of transcription . the principal transcriptional control sequences, called the rhodopsin proximal promoter , reside within ~200 bp proximal to the transcription start site  <cit> . additional regulatory sequences in mammalian genes are upstream of the rpp  <cit> . alignment of  <dig> tetrapod rpp sequences reveals an extraordinarily high degree of conservation not observed with fish or invertebrates , with four conserved cis-elements  immediately upstream of the tata box. nre, a maf family recognition element  site forty nucleotides upstream of the tata box, is a target for nrl , a transcription factor expressed exclusively in rods  <cit> . flanking the nre are three highly conserved paired-like homeodomain binding sites, ret <dig>  bat <dig> and ret <dig>  these are target sites for several paired-like homeodomain transcription factors, most notably crx but also otx <dig> and rax  <cit>  crx  is expressed in both rods and cones. nrl and crx are highly conserved among vertebrates and are essential for rhodopsin expression. nrl knockout mice have no rhodopsin transcripts and in fact, are missing most rod-specific genes  <cit> . crx knockout mice have greatly reduced rhodopsin expression  <cit> . in both knockout mice, rod differentiation is also severely affected, indicating that these genes play multiple roles in development and photoreceptor maintenance. the importance of nrl for rhodopsin transcription is further demonstrated in transgenic xenopus rods harboring nre mutant promoters, which have drastically reduced expression of a gfp reporter gene  <cit> . by contrast, individual deletion of the conserved paired-like homeobox sites does not have a major effect on reporter gene expression. nevertheless, a mechanistic basis for the combined transcriptional activity of nrl and crx  is yet to be established.

in vitro studies have largely supported those in transgenic animals, namely that nrl and crx are the key regulators of rhodopsin transcription  <cit> . nrl stimulates transcription of the rhodopsin promoter via nre in transfected non-retinal cells  <cit> . furthermore, mutagenesis of nrl has revealed multiple domains required for rhodopsin promoter transactivation  <cit> . similarly, crx alone stimulates transcription of the rhodopsin promoter in transfected non-retinal cells  <cit> . although it has a more promiscuous target, crx binds to a core sequence, taat  <cit> . rax, paired-like homeobox transcription factors, bind to the ret <dig> and bat <dig> sites  <cit>  and alone weakly activates the rhodopsin promoter  <cit> . crx and nrl interact physically and functionally in vitro. crx binds to nrl through its homeodomain  <cit> . the binding site on nrl is not as well defined  <cit> . both crx and nrl interact with other transcription factors, such as tbp  <cit> , fiz <dig>  <cit>  and qrx  <cit> , as well as chromatin modifiers  <cit> . however, the most intriguing feature of rhodopsin transcriptional activation in vitro is its cooperative  activation by crx and nrl  <cit> . together they transactivate the rhodopsin promoter an order of magnitude or more than the additive effect of the individual transcription factors. this has led to the hypothesis that in rods rhodopsin transcription is activated by the cooperative activity of crx and nrl.

current models for transcriptional activation describe the complex interplay between distal and proximal promoter regulatory elements, transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery . the usual hypothesis postulates that expression levels are determined by accessibility of the cis-elements  and the availability of functionally active transcription factors  <cit> . this leads to the localization of transcription factors on the promoter for a significant length of time and thus promotes interaction with other general transcription factors assembling on the promoter  <cit> . thus, cis-elements are thought to increase the local concentration of transcription factors and to promote protein-protein interactions. therefore, to account for rhodopsin transcription levels, it is important to quantitatively examine the contribution of dna binding site architecture to activation of the rhodopsin promoter by crx and nrl. our aim was to characterize the arrangement of dna binding motifs in the rpp, i.e.to determine the requirements for cooperative  activation by nrl-crx. employing an in vitro system coupled with mutational analysis of the rpp, we characterized the specific role of the paired-like cis-elements in activation of the xenopus rhodopsin promoter by crx and its xenopus homolog, otx <dig>  rax and a novel xenopus rax family member, rax2b  <cit> .

RESULTS
rhodopsin proximal promoter activity in transfected hek <dig> cells
hek cells  are a versatile and rapid system in which to characterize rhodopsin promoter activation, since these cells do not express nrl, crx or the endogenous  rhodopsin gene. we compared two common lines, hek <dig>  and hek293t  <cit> , the latter of which expresses the sv <dig> large t-antigen to drive episomal replication of plasmids containing the sv <dig> origin of replication  <cit> . to quantify rhodopsin promoter activation, we transiently transfected cells with a luciferase reporter under control of various promoters and plasmids encoding crx and/or nrl. the activity in the absence of added transcription factors for either the promoter-less  or a xenopus rhodopsin promoter  containing plasmid was  <dig> -fold higher in hek <dig> cells compared to hek293t cells . the concentration of promoter-luciferase plasmid for all experiments was in the linear range ; therefore this difference in activity between the two cell lines reflects higher basal transcriptional activity independent of the specific promoter upstream of the luciferase gene.

both cell lines exhibited robust transactivation of the xop promoter by the combination of human crx  and nrl  or xenopus homologs of crx  and nrl  . however, the xenopus homologs stimulated luciferase activity more strongly than their human counterparts. the higher levels of stimulation are in general agreement with our previous results, although the relative stimulation by transcription factors is somewhat higher here, mostly likely due to differences in experimental conditions.

surprising, the activity in the presence of hnrl-hcrx was 2-fold higher in hek293t cells compared to hek <dig> cells, and contrary to the corresponding basal promoter activities . it is typical to express activation by transcription factors as the relative activity, i.e. the ratio  of the activity in the presence and absence of transcription factors. for example, the activation of xop by hnrl-hcrx is 100-fold in hek293t compared to only 20-fold activation in hek <dig> cells . thus, there is a 5-fold discrepancy in the estimated synergistic activation by hnrl-hcrx in hek293t cells compared to hek <dig> cells. this difference is a result of the higher non-specific activity of xop as well as the lower maximal activation by hnrl-hcrx in hek <dig> cells. for clarity and to facilitate comparisons between different experiments, we present all transcriptional activity data in relative light units .

taken together, the low basal transcription and the higher nrl-crx stimulation in hek293t cells are better for quantifying transcriptional stimulation of rhodopsin promoters. if we assume that the same phenomenon underlies the transcriptional differences between the two cell lines in basal activity and maximal stimulation. therefore, we can eliminate differences in transfection efficiencies, plasmid copy number or rate of plasmid degradation. more likely are mechanisms which alter the luciferase template for transcription. one possibility is a difference in extrachromosomal plasmid packaging leading to alterations in plasmid conformation or episomal structure. alternatively, there could be differences in the plasmid subcellular localization that lead to differences in transcription efficiency. finally, the cells could have differences in transcription factors that lead to recognition of cryptic promoters in the plasmid backbone. it is possible that plasmids are differentially occupied by transcription complexes that are not readily displaced by hnrl-hcrx. these could account for the higher basal and lower stimulated activity in the hek <dig> cells compared to hek293t.

xenopus rhodopsin promoter 5′upstream sequence
the only region of extended conservation in tetrapod rhodopsin promoters is the rpp . comparison of the 5′ upstream sequence  of xenopus with other vertebrate rhodopsin promoters did not reveal any significant conserved regions . however, there are many core homeobox sites , including several crx binding sites, present in the 5′us that could contribute to transcriptional activation. crx binding sites have also been identified in the 5′us of mouse rhodopsin by chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromosome confirmation capture  <cit> . in xenopus transgenic frogs both − <dig> and − <dig> genomic fragments drive rod-specific reporter gene expression  <cit> . to examine the potential modulation of transcriptional activity by regions upstream of the xenopus rpp , we compared two different 5′us sequences:  to the activity of the xrpp. we controlled for plasmid size by placing the rhodopsin structural gene upstream or downstream of the xrpp . both 5′us sequences increased the synergistic stimulation of the xrpp by lnrl-otx <dig> . however, xop stimulation was 10-fold while xop was 5-fold higher than that of the xrpp. plasmid size does not account for this difference, since the activity of the -503up and -503dwn plasmids, which are similar in size to the − <dig> plasmid, was closer to the − <dig> plasmid than the − <dig> plasmid . the basal activity decreased  <dig> -fold with increased 5′us length. we also found that while human nrl-crx can strongly stimulate synergistic activation, there is no difference in the level of activity between the two promoter lengths containing upstream sequence and the xrpp as compared to the xenopus homologs . taken together, these results show that the rpp plays the principal quantitative role in determining transcriptional synergy by nrl-crx. furthermore, the 5′us enhancement of synergistic activation appears to be specific to xenopus transcription factors. qualitatively, the relative activity of the promoters containing these 5′us sequences  is similar in transgenic xenopus . however, position effects and copy number variation prevent a direct comparison between transgenics and in vitro experiments.

stable integration of xenopus rhodopsin promoter
we examined whether synergistic activation of rhodopsin promoters by nrl-crx would occur if the promoters were integrated into the host genome. we utilized the flp-in system, which allows for the expression of a single copy of the xop controlled luciferase gene per cell inserted into a specific location in the genome. we generated individual clones which were hygromycin resistant, zeocin sensitive and contained xop-luciferase or xop-luciferase. the activity in the absence of transcription factors between the four clones tested differed widely and by as much as  <dig> fold, with higher basal activities observed in the shorter promoter . lnrl individually stimulated activity with folds ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as compared to  <dig>  fold for xop and  <dig> fold for xop in transiently transfected cells. otx <dig> individually stimulated activity with folds ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as compared to  <dig>  for xop and  <dig> fold for xop in transiently transfected cells. the human homologs, hnrl and hcrx, stimulated individually but not as robustly . all four stable cell lines were synergistically activated by lnrl-otx <dig> with increased activity ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold over basal + lnrl + otx <dig> activity and for hnrl-hcrx,  <dig> - <dig>  fold. while the synergistic activation by nrl-crx is higher in transiently expressing hek293t cells, this is largely due to higher basal activity of the integrated promoters. these differences could be due to the chromatin organization of the promoter dna in an episomal environment versus an integrated state. nevertheless, the synergistic activation of these stably integrated promoters provides support for similar behavior in rod cells.

role of xop cis-elements in otx <dig> activation
our goal is to determine the quantitative contribution of the conserved cis-elements to synergistic activation of the rhodopsin promoter. previous results suggested that all four conserved elements in the rpp serve a functional role in transcriptional activation. the nre cis-element is essential for transcriptional activation of the rhodopsin promoter by crx-nrl  <cit> . deletion analysis in hek293t cells demonstrated that all three paired-like cis-elements, ret <dig>  bat <dig> and ret <dig>  contribute to the transcriptional activation by lnrl-otx <dig> . to determine more precisely the specific site of otx <dig> interaction, we generated single and multiple cis-element mutants in the xop promoter and measured otx5-lnrl stimulated reporter activity in hek293t cells. the conserved core sequences of ret <dig> and bat <dig> are atta and of ret <dig> , ctta . the core sites were changed to agga and cgga, respectively, to disrupt binding of paired-like transcription factors . mutation of ret <dig>  in xop increased activity 17% compared to wild type  . the bat <dig> site has two conserved atta sites. mutation of the first site  decreased activity by 58%, while mutation of the second bat <dig> site  increased activity by 26% compared to wt . mutation of ret <dig>  significantly decreased activity by 68% . mutation of both the ret <dig> site and the first bat <dig> core site  increased activity in the short promoter fragment by 35%. mutation of both bat <dig> sites  decreased the activity by 50%. mutation of both ret <dig> and ret <dig>  decreased the activity by 45%. mutation of the two bat <dig> sites in combination with ret <dig>  dramatically decreased the activity by 94%. mutation of the bat <dig> sites in combination with the ret <dig> site  decreased the activity by 61%. mutations in all four conserved core sites  strongly inhibited otx5-lnrl stimulated activity 92%. none of the mutants were able to inhibit the activity to basal levels. similar results were obtained for the longer xop promoter  containing identical combinations of mutations . these mutational studies show that otx <dig> utilizes both the bat <dig> and ret <dig> sites equally and additively to activate the promoter in concert with lnrl. the ret <dig> site and second bat <dig> site do not appear to be necessary for activation but contribute to the overall level of transcriptional activation. in addition, otx <dig> does not utilize ret <dig> for transactivation. furthermore, while the cis-elements in the proximal promoter are required for maximal otx5-lnrl activation, the 5′us contributes to xop activation. we can conclude that ret <dig> has a functional role distinct from bat <dig> and ret <dig> in this assay. only one of the bat <dig> aata sites is important for transactivation despite the strong conservation of both.

identification of a novel rax family member
using a yeast one hybrid screen with the ret <dig> cis-element  as bait and a xenopus laevis adult retina cdna library, we identified a novel gene, which we name rax2b . rax2b is a member of the rax paired-like homeodomain transcription factor family and in sequence comparisons is the paralog of rax2a  <cit>  . rax2b was detected by rt-pcr in embryos at stage 35/ <dig> . all rax family genes were expressed in the adult retina with rax1a the most highly expressed followed by rax2b, rax2a and rax1b .

co-activation of rhodopsin transcription by the rax family
we measured the activity of two rhodopsin promoter fragments  co-expressed with individual members of the rax family alone or in combination with lnrl and/or otx <dig> in transfected hek293t cells. individually, each rax transcription factor decreased basal activity of xop. in combination with otx <dig> or lnrl, rax did not significantly increase activity . all four rax transcription factors in combination with otx5-lnrl increased activity  by 17% , 26% , 20%  and 31% . similar results were observed for the longer promoter   . these data demonstrate that rax family tfs are co-activators with nrl and crx of rhodopsin transcription.

role of xrpp cis-elements in rax co-activation
to determine the xrpp cis-element utilized by rax, we measured otx5-lnrl-rax2b stimulated promoter activity in the deletion and the xop promoter mutants in transfected hek293t cells. rax2b increased otx5-lnrl stimulated activity by 30% in the bat1Δ mutant but had no effect on the level of activity of the ret1Δ or ret1/bat1Δ mutants . rax2b co-activation was abolished in the xop promoters with a mutated ret <dig> site , m <dig> , m <dig>  m <dig> , m <dig>  but preserved in the promoters containing mutations in the bat <dig> or the ret <dig> sites , m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig> ) . these mutant data suggest that rax2b co-activates transcription specifically through the ret <dig> site.

rax co-activates preferentially through the ret <dig> site
to examine further the apparent preference of rax for the ret <dig> cis-element, we compared otx5-lnrl stimulated activity with titrated concentrations of rax1b or rax2b using xop  and a xop fragment truncated just before the ret <dig> site  . rax1b increased the otx5-lnrl stimulated activity of xop maximally by 3-fold at a 1: <dig> ratio, plateauing at higher concentrations . the rax2b titration results were comparable . these data suggest that rax does not compete with otx <dig> for the same cis-element but preferentially selects the ret <dig> site for co-activation. interestingly, a similar result was obtained titrating otx <dig> in the presence of lnrl and measuring xop activity , suggesting that otx <dig> does not utilize the ret <dig> site for activation. addition of rax1b decreased the otx5-lnrl stimulated activity of the truncated xop fragment  by 2-fold at a  <dig> : <dig> ratio and maximally at a ratio of 4: <dig>  comparable results were obtained for rax2b with an initial  <dig> -fold decrease steadily dropping to below stimulatory levels of otx5-lnrl alone. these results suggest that when the ret <dig> site is abolished, rax can compete with otx <dig> for the bat <dig> and/or ret <dig> sites as indicated by the decrease in otx5-lnrl stimulation. importantly despite the ability of rax to compete with otx <dig>  it cannot replace otx <dig> to partner with nrl for synergistic activation of the promoter. thus, while rax is able to interact with the bat <dig> sight, it still preferentially selects ret <dig> in the complete xrpp.

discussion
nrl-crx synergy
we used hek293t cells for quantitatively measuring transcriptional activation of the rhodopsin promoter by nrl, crx and rax. the transcriptional activity of the xenopus rhodopsin gene is regulated by a combination of these transcription factors interacting with multiple conserved sequence motifs. the transiently transfected cultured cells are a powerful tool for the quantitative measurement of promoter activation by individual or combinations of tfs, although they do not mimic the photoreceptor cell/native chromatin environment. we demonstrated that the xenopus rhodopsin proximal promoter  is solely responsible for regulating the synergistic activation by nrl-crx/otx <dig>  these results build on previous published studies  which initially identified the essential regulatory sites in the xenopus rpp: nre, ret <dig>  bat <dig> and ret <dig>  <cit> . it has been clearly established that the nre cis-element, which binds nrl, can modestly activate transcription, alone, and is required for synergistic activation of rhodopsin transcription in concert with crx/otx <dig>  <cit> . to date, little is known about the contribution of the highly conserved paired-like cis-elements, ret <dig>  bat <dig>  and ret <dig>  to synergistic activation by nrl-crx/otx <dig>  otx <dig> activated through the bat <dig> and ret <dig> sites, and both were utilized equally for synergistic activation in concert with nrl. the ret <dig> site was not utilized by otx <dig> and thus, did not contribute to the synergistic activation. based on these results and those of previous studies  <cit> , these data support a model of rhodopsin transcriptional regulation by nrl and crx/otx <dig> . an nrl site and a crx site within 40 bp of each other are found in many photoreceptor genes and constructs containing these cis-regulatory elements were capable of driving high levels of expression in mouse retina explants  <cit> . interestingly, synthetic promoters, which contained different arrangements of nrl/crx motifs but lacked overall sequence homology, where able to drive robust expression in mouse retinal explants. many photoreceptor genes are regulated by nrl and crx and synergistic activation has been observed often  <cit> . thus, the arrangement and spacing of these promoter cis-elements appears to be important for generating high levels of gene expression.

a recent study quantifying bovine rhodopsin promoter activity in mouse retinal explants reported that the bat <dig> site was not only essential  for promoter activation but was the most efficient site in driving activity  <cit> . the ret <dig> site appeared to be less important in transcriptional activation in this live mouse cell system. substitution of the mouse ret <dig> and ret <dig> sites with a bat <dig> consensus sequence motif increased activity by 10-fold. replacing the ret <dig> sequence with bat <dig> consensus sequence increased activity approximately 4-fold. these differences suggest that there may be species dependent differences in opsin gene regulation, either from subtle sequence variation or transcription factor complexes functional across different cells.

rax is a co-activator of rhodopsin
we identified a novel retinal homeobox transcription factor, rax2b, which is a paralog of rax1a  <cit> . rax <dig> belongs to the aristaless-related paired-like homeobox gene family, which includes rax1a and rax1b. in promoter activity assays employing mutant promoter constructs, we demonstrated that while the ret <dig> cis-element is not utilized by otx <dig> for cooperative activation by nrl-otx <dig>  it is utilized by rax to enhance the level of synergistic activation. furthermore, rax activates, selectively and preferentially, through ret <dig> and cannot substitute for otx <dig> as a co-activator with nrl of synergistic activation. these results suggest that the ret <dig> site is used by rax to fine tune synergistic activation by nrl-otx <dig>  based upon our results, we suggest that rax provides the cell with an additional means of increasing rhodopsin expression levels. an unidentified repressor might also modulate transcription through the ret <dig> site to inhibit transcription. rax has been shown to bind to ret <dig>  bat <dig> and ret <dig> motifs in in vitro binding assays and to ret <dig> by chip  <cit> . previously published studies have also reported that rax, alone, can weakly activate rhodopsin transcription and in combination with nrl-crx, can enhance synergistic activation  <cit> . the rax family , which is found in most vertebrate species, has been implicated in eye formation, playing a critical role in cell-fate determination and development  <cit> . rax <dig> and rax <dig> continue to be expressed in the adult retina. however, the functional role of rax in the mature retina is not clear. qrx, a paired-like homeodomain tf, appears to be the mammalian ortholog to rax <dig>  <cit> . it is expressed in both the outer and inner nuclear layers of the retina. in transient tranfection reporter activity assays, it activated rhodopsin expression through the ret <dig> site, was a weak activator alone but enhanced nrl-crx synergy. interestingly, mice do not appear to carry the rax <dig> gene. however, the regulatory machinery for rax <dig> seems to be intact, since transgenic mice strongly expressed an egfp-tagged qrx promoter fragment in photoreceptors.

role of rhodopsin 5′ us
the transcriptional activity assays performed on different lengths of the xenopus rhodopsin promoter provide additional insights into promoter activation. while the rpp was responsible for the cooperative synergistic activation by nrl, crx and rax, the 5′ upstream promoter sequence  distal to the rpp contributed to the activation as well. the level of activity was dependent on the length of the promoter as well as the species of tfs used to activate. this observation was reinforced by the promoter activity assay data in which all three paired-like cis-elements were mutated , resulting in a dramatic but not complete loss of activation. these results suggest that there are regulatory elements upstream of the xenopus rpp that enhance transcription and are species-specific. this seems plausible since a distal regulatory element, the rhodopsin enhancer element , which activates transcription, has been described for the mammalian promoter and is required for maximal activation of expression in vivo <cit> . although we could not identify any conserved sequence element similar to the mammalian rer, there are multiple core atta/ctta sites present in the 5′us, including core ret <dig> , bat <dig> , ret <dig>  and nre  motifs which could potentially bind crx, rax, other paired-like tfs or bzip tfs, such as nrl, which might contribute to the increased activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we characterized regulatory regions of the xenopus rhodopsin promoter and their contribution to transcriptional activation. the rpp is solely responsible for synergistic activation, however, the 5′us contributes to overall transcriptional activity. we defined quantitatively the individual contributions of xenopus rhodopsin promoter cis-elements to synergistic activation of transcription by the paired like transcription factors, rax and crx/otx <dig>  we showed specificity of the interaction between the transcription factors and cis-elements. rax preferentially binds to the ret <dig> cis-element and augments synergy, while otx5/crx binds to both the bat <dig> and ret <dig> cis-elements, contributing equally to synergistic activation. these studies characterizing the rhodopsin promoter architecture will advance our understanding of the role of transcriptional network machinery in rod photoreceptor development and homeostasis.
