BACKGROUND
soybean cyst nematode  is the most economically devastating pathogen of soybean and causes losses in soybean producing areas worldwide with no practical means of eradication  <cit> . the annual losses exceed one billion dollars in the united states alone  <cit> . two resistance genes for scn, rhg <dig>  on chromosome   <dig> and rhg <dig> on chr <dig>  have been identified in the soybean germplasm, and have been shown to be the key sources of resistance in soybean cultivars  <cit> . the rhg <dig> locus, which is crucial for broad spectrum resistance to scn, has been identified in various resistance sources, such as pi  <dig> and peking  <cit> .

scn field populations are genetically variable  <cit> . sixteen scn races have been described and the race designation was determined by comparing its reproduction on a set of four soybean differentials with a standard scn-susceptible cultivar. to avoid the implication of genetic predictability, a revised classification scheme for field scn population introduced the heterodera glycines  types determined by reactions to seven indicator lines  <cit> . the distribution of scn populations in the field varied among different geographic regions. however, race  <dig> is the most frequently found scn populations in major soybean producing states in the usa  <cit> . soybean lines pi  <dig> and peking are the two main sources of resistance to scn race  <dig>  <cit> . over 90% of the commercially available scn-resistant soybean cultivars in the usa carry the rhg1-b allele, which is derived from pi  <dig> due to its desirable agronomic characteristics  <cit> . while pi 88788-type resistance only requires the rhg <dig> resistance allele, peking-type resistance needs both rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> resistance alleles for a resistant phenotype  <cit> . although the molecular basis of scn-resistance is still unknown, recent studies have shed light on the genes involved in the resistance. map-based cloning showed that a single gene at rhg <dig> locus encoding a serine hydroxymethyltransferase  is responsible for scn resistance  <cit> . two polymorphisms have been identified in the coding sequence of shmt, 389 g/c in the first exon and  <dig>  a/t in the second exon, which resulted in the amino acid change of arginine  to proline  and tyrosine to asparagine , respectively. these polymorphisms change the property of the enzyme and may correlate with rhg4-dependent resistance and susceptibility  <cit> . genetic mapping and gene functional analysis of the rhg1-b locus exhibited a  <dig>  kb genomic segment encoding a predicted amino acid transporter , an α–snap protein  and a protein with wound-inducible protein  <dig>    <cit> . gene silencing and overexpression analysis showed that all three genes contribute to scn resistance  <cit> . interestingly, the phenotypic reaction to scn is associated with the copy number variation of this  <dig>  kb fragment. only one copy is present in susceptible varieties, such as williams  <dig>  and multiple copies in scn resistant lines. for example, peking possesses three copies and seven to  <dig> copies were detected in pi 88788-derived resistant lines  <cit> . sequencing of cdna from several soybean lines revealed that multiple alleles of glyma18g <dig> were present in the different multi-copy rhg <dig> categories  <cit> .

planting of resistant soybean cultivars combined with crop rotation formulates the best management strategy for reducing yield losses due to scn. however, traditional breeding for resistant lines is challenging, not just because the phenotyping of scn is time-consuming, but it is also affected by the different resistance genes  <cit>  and varied scn populations in the field  <cit> . therefore, the use of molecular markers to assist the selection of scn resistance is a crucial improvement in breeding programs. major efforts have been made to develop genetic markers linked to scn resistance genes. restriction fragment length polymorphisms  markers have been identified and reported to facilitate soybean breeding for both rhg <dig>  <cit>  and rhg <dig> loci  <cit> . simple sequence repeats  have further been discovered and applied in the marker-assisted selection of scn resistance  <cit> . snp/indel markers have also been developed at the flanking region of both loci  <cit> . however, they are not diagnostic markers, and both ssrs and rflps are labor/time-consuming and cost ineffective. thus, they are very limited to be applied in breeding programs in a high throughput setting.

here, we report the development of three robust, functional snp marker assays, two for the rhg <dig> locus and one for rhg <dig>  these functional snp markers provide genotype information which can be used for the high-throughput selection of scn resistance, as well as differentiating peking and pi  <dig> resistance sources for breeding of scn resistance cultivars and germplasm introgression.

RESULTS
snp discovery
to determine snp markers within the rhg <dig> locus, published sequences of the region were gathered which included the entire  <dig>  kb block from pi  <dig> and williams  <dig>  <cit> , but only the cdna of glyma18g <dig> from peking was available  <cit> . moreover, we fully sequenced the genomic dna of glyma18g <dig> from  <dig> soybean lines and cdna of glyma18g <dig> from forrest, essex, williams  <dig> and pi  <dig> at the rhg <dig> locus. sequence alignment was only carried out for glyma18g <dig>  glyma18g <dig> and glyma18g <dig>  because other genes  in this  <dig>  kb block are not functional according to the previous study  <cit> . three snps were identified in glyma18g <dig> from the comparison between williams  <dig> and pi  <dig>  one synonymous snp in the first exon, one in the intron and one in the 3’ untranslated region  . glyma18g <dig> possesses more snp/indels. the alignment of both published sequences  and our sequencing result of  <dig> soybean lines  revealed five snps in the 6th exon and two snps in the last exon. all of them lead to amino acid changes in the protein. three snps from the 5’utr of glyma <dig> have also been demonstrated between williams  <dig> and pi  <dig> figure  <dig> schematic graph showed the position of snp/indels at rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> loci. a. two snps identified at glyma08g <dig> at rhg <dig> locus. b.  <dig> snp/indels identified in three genes within a  <dig>  kb block at rhg <dig> locus. blue squares represent exons and black lines represent utrs and/or introns. the genome coordinates  are shown under each snp in parenthesis. snp alleles in black are from published sequences and snp alleles in red from our sequencing results.



to evaluate which snps correlate with known scn reactions of soybean lines, kompetitive allele specific pcr  assays were developed and tested for all  <dig> snps at the rhg <dig> locus and two previously identified snps  at rhg <dig> locus  <cit>  using  <dig> soybean lines with known scn reactions. two snps from glyma08g <dig> are associated with the rhg <dig> resistance allele, and they are completely linked . three snps in glyma18g <dig> and two snp/indels in the last exon of glyma18g <dig> are associated with the rhg <dig> resistance allele, and all five markers are completely linked. five snps in the 6th exon of glyma18g <dig> could distinguish the sources of peking-type and pi88788-type resistance. however, three snps identified in the 5’-utr of glyma18g <dig> showed no correlation with scn resistance. three snps were selected to provide genotype information for the selection of scn resistance , which were designated as gsm <dig>  gsm <dig> and gsm <dig>  gsm <dig> and gsm <dig> are located in the 6th and last exons of glyma18g <dig> at the rhg <dig> locus, respectively, while gsm <dig> is in the first exon of glyma08g <dig>  the kasp assays of three snps performed with  <dig> soybean lines exhibited a good clustering of the homozygous alleles, suggesting that it is feasible to employ those markers for selection.figure  <dig> positions of three snps in glyma18g <dig> and glyma08g <dig> at rgh <dig> and rhg <dig> loci, respectively. gsm numbers were used to designate snp markers. blue squares represent exons and black lines represent introns and utrs. the genome coordinates  of each snp are shown.

haplotype comparison of resistance sources
haplotype analysis was performed using the soy50k snp infinium chip data of  <dig> lines and nine cultivars including woodruff, hartwig, boggs, gordon, bryan, g00- <dig>  prichard, bedford and carver. the rhg <dig> region was compared between peking and the peking-type lines: forrest, woodruff, hartwig, boggs, gordon, bryan, pi  <dig>  pi  <dig> and pi  <dig>  revealing that these lines have same haplotypes to peking at the rhg <dig> locus as large as  <dig>  mbp. a 788 kb haplotype window block was shown in figure 3a. hartwig, pi  <dig>  pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> showed a relatively small haplotype window  when compared to peking. woodruff had a larger haplotype block that is about  <dig> mbp and over  <dig> mbp was observed in forrest, gordon and bryan. however, pi  <dig> and other susceptible-type lines showed no introgression from peking at the rhg <dig> locus. all eight pi 88788-type lines, g00- <dig>  prichard, bedford, carver, pi  <dig>  pi  <dig>  pi  <dig> and pi 603587a exhibited haplotype window blocks ranging from  <dig> mbp to  <dig> mbp, when compared to pi  <dig> at the rhg <dig> region. haplotype analysis of rhg <dig> locus on chr <dig> indicated haplotype window blocks from peking and nine peking-type lines , with a smaller region of 348 kb in woodruff, boggs and bryan. however, the introgressed haplotype blocks are as large as  <dig> mbp in forrest, hartwig and gordon. examination of the pedigrees of these lines indicated that peking is present somewhere in the extended pedigree of these six cultivars   <cit> . these data are consistent with genotype indications of our three snps alleles and further substantiated the effectiveness of these snp markers.figure  <dig> haplotype analysis at rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> loci using soy50k snp infinium chip data. twenty-seven soybean plant introductions and nine cultivars, woodruff, hartwig, boggs, gordon, bryan, g00- <dig>  prichard, bedford and carver were used. a. haplotype analysis at rhg <dig> locus. snps alleles at the rhg <dig> region on chr <dig> were compared to peking and pi  <dig>  respectively. a  <dig> kbp region  consisting of  <dig> snps is shown in the graph. b. haplotype analysis at rhg <dig> locus. snps alleles at the rhg <dig> region on chr <dig> were compared to peking. a  <dig> mbp region  consisting of  <dig> snps is shown here. the reference line is shown in dark red. red squares represent same alleles as the reference and green squares represent alleles that are different from the reference. the position of the locus and the resistance types are as indicated.



validation of snp markers
to validate the snp markers with more diverse lines, we explored the data from the previous three years’ usda uniform soybean tests for southern states where the phenotypes of scn race  <dig> are available for all the tested lines. we requested a total of  <dig> lines from eight institutions and performed kasp assays on these lines with snp markers, gsm <dig>  gsm <dig> and gsm <dig> . the snp genotypes, scn race  <dig> reactions and pedigrees were listed . the rating of scn phenotype is on a scale of  <dig> to  <dig> based on the number of cysts, thus, lines with ratings smaller than  <dig> were considered as resistant and lines with ratings equal to or greater than  <dig> as susceptible. a strong accordance was observed between snp genotypes and reactions to scn race  <dig> for  <dig> germplasm lines with an exception of  <dig> lines . due to the large discrepancy of ratings for same line between two years, eight lines were excluded for analysis. single factor analysis using general linear model  showed a significant correlation between scn resistance phenotypes and genotypes consisted of three snp markers . moreover, we have examined the extended pedigrees  of these lines with resistance rhg <dig> allele  to identify the sources of resistance . the snp genotypes are in complete agreement with the resistance sources based on extended pedigrees: peking-source with a g allele at gsm <dig> and pi 88788-source with a c allele, indicating that gsm <dig> is a functional snp to differentiate peking and pi  <dig> sources for the rhg <dig> resistance allele.figure  <dig> kasp graphs of three snps for validation and precision genotyping test population. a. kasp snp graphs of  <dig> soybean lines from 2011– <dig> usda southern uniform soybean tests with known scn race  <dig> reactions. b. kasp snp graphs of f5-derived rils from the population derived from g00- <dig> x lg04- <dig> 



we also performed a precision genotyping test on a bi-parental population of f5-derived recombinant inbred lines  from g00- <dig> x lg04- <dig>  the line g00- <dig> carries a peking-source rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> resistance alleles  and is resistant to scn race  <dig>  while lg04- <dig> is a susceptible line with t, c and c alleles for gsm <dig>  gsm <dig>  and gsm <dig>  respectively. three replicates of  <dig> rils with two parents were arranged in a randomized complete block design in greenhouse and each entry was genotyped with three snp markers . ten weeks after inoculation, phenotyping was carried out by counting the numbers of cysts on the roots of each individual plant. resulting phenotypes demonstrated that combination of the resistance rhg <dig>  and resistance rhg <dig> alleles  brought a resistant phenotype with only  <dig>  cyst/plant and all the other combinations exhibited a more susceptible phenotype , suggesting that these three markers can be employed for the selection of scn race  <dig> resistance from a population derived from peking source. single factor analysis using a glm procedure in sas  <dig>  was performed for three subsets individually and combined. all of them showed a significant correlation between the average number of cysts and genotypes of three snps, gsm <dig>  gsm <dig>  and gsm <dig> , with an r-square of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for ril sets  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and combined, respectively. the different r-square values among sets might be due to the conditions at different inoculation times.figure  <dig> reactions of race <dig> to different combinations of snp marker alleles for 150 f <dig> families of g00- <dig> x lg04- <dig>  rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> genotypes are represented as combinations of alleles of snp markers, gsm <dig>  gsm <dig> and gsm <dig>  boxes show median, 25% to 75% of the data and whiskers extend to minimum and maximum of the data.

discussion
the genetic basis of resistance to scn is complex in soybean, not only because resistance to scn is multi-genic, but also because different sets of genes/ quantitative trait loci  confer resistance to the diverse populations of scn due to their genetic heterogeneity. field populations of soybean cyst nematode have been classified into  <dig> races based on their ability to develop on resistant cultivars  <cit> . resistance to scn is race-cultivar specific  <cit> , for example, soybean cultivars derived from peking source are commonly claimed to be resistant to race  <dig> and  <dig>  however, the cultivars with scn resistance from pi  <dig> are usually shown to be resistant to race  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . a growing body of evidence has shown different defense loci that underlie resistance to different races. the rhg <dig> locus on chr <dig> is necessary for resistance to all scn races  <cit> . many other cultivar-race specific qtls have been demonstrated in resistance sources, such as rhg <dig> for race  <dig> and  <dig>  rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> for race  <dig> and rhg <dig> for race  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . although two functional snps have been identified for rhg <dig> locus  <cit> , no high-throughput marker assays have been reported to date. moreover, several snps have been found at rhg <dig> locus  <cit> , but no specific functional snps as well as detection assays have been reported to associate with the resistance allele, nor the snps to differentiate sources of resistance. built on the previous discoveries of copy number variation, gene dosage, and dna methylation at the rhg <dig> locus by cook et al.  <cit>  and snps at the rhg <dig> locus by liu et al.  <cit> , in this study, we have developed snp marker assays, gsm <dig>  gsm <dig>  and gsm <dig> at rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> locus for the selection of resistance alleles, . the snps reside in the coding sequences of resistance genes  and also introduce changes in protein sequences, thus they can be considered as functional markers for scn race  <dig> resistance and applied in high throughput marker-assisted selection with high accuracy. similarly, the knowledge of additional loci along with the genome sequence of soybean may be used in the marker development for resistance to different scn races.

pi  <dig> has been the primary choice in soybean cultivar development as a source for scn resistance  <cit> , however, scn populations have demonstrated the capability to mutate and recombine to new races, which can overcome the soybean resistance derived from pi  <dig>  <cit> . reports have shown that pi  <dig> has not been providing sufficient protection against scn in some fields  <cit> . thus, additional resistance sources are desired to be used for developing new resistant cultivars and peking is believed to be an attractive option. although snp gsm <dig> discriminates resistant and susceptible rhg <dig> alleles, it does not distinguish pi 88788- and peking-type rhg <dig> loci. thus, to identify the sources of resistance, we demonstrated that one snp marker at rhg <dig> locus, gsm <dig> was able to distinguish peking from pi  <dig> loci for most soybean germplasm . this snp can be employed in differentiating peking from pi  <dig> sources for the rhg <dig> allele for breeding programs.

the successful prediction rate for three snp markers at rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> loci is over 93% in this study . a few lines  and two lines from  <dig> validation lines ) did not show a correlation between the expected phenotypes and the resistance snp alleles. a number of factors may result in the discrepancy between genotyping and phenotyping results, including 1) phenotyping/ or seed source errors: some of the lines have been tested for only one year, and one-time phenotyping of scn resistance may not be definitive; 2) sources other than pi  <dig> and peking may be providing resistance; and 3) the complexity of the rhg <dig> region is not fully understood. a future study will be designed to understand why the lines with the resistance genotypes did not have a resistance reaction to scn race  <dig>  the  <dig>  kb region at rgh <dig> locus is repeated in resistant genotypes  <cit> , and the sequences of the individual copies are also variant within a single genotype, which makes marker development challenging for the rhg <dig> locus. we also tested marker performance with artificial heterozygous dna, where pi 88788/ peking and williams  <dig> dna were mixed at 1: <dig> ratio. although the artificial heterozygous allele cluster was located a little closer towards the resistant homozygous allele cluster in the kasp snp graphs  because of the gene repeats in resistant lines, the alleles can still be called clearly. therefore, the functional snp markers that we identified can be used not only to select the resistance allele, but also to differentiate resistance sources, which were also confirmed by analysis of the rhg <dig> region with soy50k snp infinium chip data using  <dig> soybean lines .

a recent study of the rhg <dig> locus revealed that copy number variation of the 31 kb dna fragment, dna sequence variation, and differentially methylated patterns were correlated with the rhg1-mediated resistance to scn  <cit> . these discoveries may also offer additional selection strategies for the rhg <dig> allele, in addition to the functional snp detection assays we developed. cook et al.  <cit>  explored the whole genome data for rhg <dig> locus in  <dig> soybean lines, and multiple lines are in common in both studies. in this study, we got the same c-terminal protein sequence of glyma18g <dig> for both low-copy and high-copy rhg <dig> as described in the previous study , indicating that gsm  <dig> maybe also exist in their dna sequences. interestingly, they identified a novel splice isoform of glyma18g <dig> cdna in peking-type rhg <dig> lines, however, we did not detect this isoform in our cdna sequencing, probably due to the low copy number of this isoform and use of a different sequencing method. thus, more studies are needed to investigate the rhg <dig> locus in various soybean lines for new insights into the development of improved selection approaches.

soybean cyst nematode is estimated to cause more than one billion dollars yield loss annually in the usa  <cit> , and thus nematode resistance is of tremendous interest to soybean breeders and growers. the snp markers we identified could be used to guide the screening of soybean germplasm for scn resistance for both peking and pi  <dig> sources, as well as to improve the efficiency and precision of selection for scn resistance in breeding programs. if the known resistance source was used as one of the parents in a cross, only gsm <dig> is needed to select for pi 88788-type resistance, while both gsm <dig> and gsm <dig> are required to select for peking-type resistance. moreover, the kasp assays that we developed were pcr-based assays and robust in detecting the resistance allele and separating heterozygotes from homozygotes and thus can be used in high-throughput selection of scn resistance. finally, with aid of molecular markers, multiple scn resistance genes can be pyramided into elite soybean genotypes in a more timely and labor-efficient manner.

CONCLUSIONS
the genomic sequence of glyma08g <dig> at rhg <dig> locus in  <dig> soybean lines and glyma18g <dig> at rhg <dig> locus in  <dig> lines, along with the known reactions to soybean cyst nematode race  <dig> of these lines, allowed us to identify functional snps and develop robust kasp snp assays for marker-assisted breeding. using a panel of  <dig> soybean germplasm and a segregating bi-parent population, we have validated the usefulness of these three snp markers, two at rhg <dig> locus and one at rhg <dig>  the results of this work demonstrated that these markers could be applied for high throughput selection of scn resistance from pi  <dig> and peking sources and for accelerating breeding of scn resistance in an accurate and efficient manner.
