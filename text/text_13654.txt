BACKGROUND
peg <dig> was the first imprinted gene to be identified in proximal mouse chromosome  <dig>  and encodes a c2h2-type zinc finger protein, which is predicted to be a dna-binding transcription factor  <cit> . the expression of peg <dig> is ubiquitous, spatially and temporarily, but exhibits very high levels in the neuronal and germ cells of both mouse and human  <cit> . consistently, peg <dig> has been shown to be involved in controlling nurturing behaviors and fetal growth rates  <cit> . independent studies also indicated that human peg <dig> might be a downstream gene for the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway  <cit> . usp <dig> is another imprinted gene that is located right next to peg <dig> in a head-to-head orientation  <cit> . the physiological role of usp <dig> is currently unknown, but it is believed to be involved in the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway. according to previous studies, usp <dig> is also expressed highly in mouse brains but much lower levels than peg <dig>  <cit> . the overall spatial expression patterns of usp <dig> are similar to those of peg <dig>  the transcription start sites  for peg <dig> and usp <dig> are located very close to each other,  <dig> bp apart, and thus a genomic region surrounding the two tsss is thought to function as a bidirectional promoter for peg <dig> and usp <dig>  a broader genomic region,  <dig>  kb in length, surrounding the two tsss is a cpg island displaying allele-specific dna methylation. the maternal allele of this region is methylated while the paternal allele is unmethylated  <cit> . thus, this region is called the peg3-dmr . this allele-specific methylation pattern is setup during gametogenesis and maintained throughout somatic cells  <cit> . this maternal-specific methylation of the peg3-dmr is consistent with the paternal-specific expression of the two genes.

the peg3-dmr can be divided into two smaller regions: the  <dig> -kb promoter region containing two 1st exons and tsss for peg <dig> and usp <dig>  and the  <dig> -kb 1st intron region of peg <dig> . the  <dig> -kb 1st intron of peg <dig> is known to harbor two evolutionarily conserved sequence elements, cse <dig> and cse <dig>  <cit> . a single copy of the 42-bp-long cse <dig> is located 1-kb downstream of the 1st exon of peg <dig>  the relative position and orientation of cse <dig> to peg3's 1st exon are well conserved among all the mammals tested. the g-rich sequence of cse <dig> is also well conserved. however, the exact roles and binding proteins for cse <dig> are currently unknown. by contrast, many copies of the 11-bp cse <dig> are distributed over the  <dig> -kb region without any obvious pattern of location and spacing among different mammals. but the orientation of each copy of cse <dig> is the same and is conserved among different species. similar clusters of transcription-factor binding sites are also observed in other imprinted domains, such as ctcf sites in h19/igf <dig> and dlk1/gtl <dig>  <cit> . as seen in the ctcf sites of other domains, the genomic region surrounding the cse2s was also shown to have an enhancer-blocking activity  <cit> . according to chip experiments, cse <dig> acts as an in vivo dna-binding site for transcription factor yy <dig>  yy <dig> binding to cse <dig> is allele-specific, only to the unmethylated paternal allele of the peg3-dmr. subsequent sirna-based yy <dig> knockdown experiments further demonstrated the involvement of yy <dig> in the dna methylation and transcriptional control of the peg3-dmr  <cit> . nevertheless, it is still unclear if and how cse <dig>  are directly involved in the transcriptional control and other related roles of the peg3-dmr.

the two conserved elements, cse <dig> and cse <dig>  are likely to have functional roles in both genomic imprinting and transcription of the two neighbor genes, peg <dig> and usp <dig>  in the current study, we sought to characterize these two elements in terms of their possible roles in transcriptional control for peg <dig> and usp <dig> using in vitro reporter assay systems. we performed several series of mutagenesis experiments and analyzed the effects of these mutations on the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr. according to the results, cse <dig>  functions as an orientation-dependent transcriptional activator for the peg <dig> transcription, whereas cse <dig> acts as an orientation-dependent repressor for the transcription of both peg <dig> and usp <dig> 

RESULTS
cse <dig>  as a transcriptional activator
to analyze the functional roles of cse <dig>  in the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr, we have generated a series of  <dig> different constructs by modifying and subcloning the  <dig> -kb endogenous region of the mouse peg3-dmr containing  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites into a promoterless reporter system, ires-β-geo . each of these constructs differs from the others by the orientation and number of yy <dig> binding sites. the orientation of the yy <dig> binding sites was reversed by subcloning the  <dig> -kb yy <dig> binding region in the opposite orientation relative to the endogenous genomic region of the peg3-dmr . to mutate the  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites of mouse peg3-dmr, three bases located within the core motif of each yy <dig> binding site were changed from ggcgccatctt to ggcattatctt . this mutagenesis experiment was also performed serially on each of the yy <dig> binding sites starting from the one located on the 5'-side to the one on the 3'-side, resulting in a series of the fragments containing the different numbers of yy <dig> binding sites . these constructs were individually transfected into three different cell lines, hela, nih3t <dig> and neuro2a, along with the internal control luciferase vector  in order to normalize the β-gal activity.

the first series of experiments was conducted as shown in fig. 1a. in this series, the normalized transcriptional activity of each construct was compared to the activity of the construct 1+c, which contains the  <dig> -kb genomic region spanning from the promoter to the cse <dig> region of peg <dig>  as compared to the promoter activity of construct 1+c, the inclusion of the  <dig> -kb yy <dig> binding region in the forward direction resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase , but not when it was included in the reverse direction . this suggests that the observed boosting effect of the  <dig> -kb yy <dig> binding region is orientation-dependent. the constructs containing mutated yy <dig> binding sites showed a dramatic decrease in the promoter activity of peg <dig> in both directions . there are only  <dig> base differences  between construct 1+c+yf and construct 1+c+myf. yet, these targeted mutations on  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites completely abrogated the original increase in activity that was caused by the inclusion of the  <dig> -kb yy <dig> binding region. also, the direction of the mutated yy <dig> binding sites did not have any major effect on activity  although the opposite direction somewhat reduced the activity. however, this reduction was not observed consistently in other cell lines . therefore, the above results suggest that the increased transcriptional activity caused by the  <dig> -kb yy <dig> binding region is mainly derived from these  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites.

the second series of experiments was performed to test the effects of different numbers of yy <dig> binding sites on the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr . in this series, the normalized transcriptional activities of all the constructs were compared to the activity of the construct 1+c+yf, which contains  <dig> intact yy <dig> binding sites. the value for this control construct was adjusted to  <dig> , which is the estimated value from the first series, in order to compare the different values derived from the two different series . as shown in fig. 1b, the transcriptional activities of all constructs decreased as compared to that of the construct 1+c+yf. the mutations on the first three yy <dig> binding sites resulted in about 30% reduction in the activity , and the mutations on two additional yy <dig> sites further decreased the activity . the observed decrease in the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr is somewhat gradual but not proportional to the reduction in the number of yy <dig> binding sites. in particular, the final mutation construct  reversed this overall decreasing pattern with the activity about 80% of the control vector . this suggests that each of the yy <dig> binding sites might have different levels of contribution and/or even different roles. the results presented in fig. 1b are derived from ires-β-geo, but another set of results derived from the more sensitive ires-luciferase system also derived an almost identical pattern . in sum, the above results demonstrated the yy <dig> binding sites as a transcriptional activator for the peg3-dmr, and further suggest that each of the yy <dig> binding sites may have slightly different levels of contribution and/or role for the overall transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr.

the above results were consistently observed from three different cell lines that have been used for these promoter assays. we are providing the results from hela and nih3t <dig> . the above sets of experiments were also repeated to test the potential roles of cse <dig> in the usp <dig> direction. however, we were not able to detect any transcriptional activity of the bidirectional promoter in the usp <dig> direction .

cse <dig>  not as an enhancer blocker
since the genomic region surrounding yy <dig> binding sites was initially shown to have an insulator  activity, we performed a series of follow-up studies to test if yy <dig> binding sites are also responsible for this insulator activity  <cit> . although the yy <dig> sites are proven to be an enhancer for peg <dig>  an immediate neighbor gene, it is also possible that yy <dig> sites may function as an insulator for other distantly located imprinted genes, such as zim <dig> and zim <dig>  which has been often seen in other imprinted domains. for this series of analysis, we used an original 800-bp dna fragment derived from human peg3-dmr, which was used for our initial study  <cit> . this initial 800-bp fragment of human peg3-dmr, hyy1- <dig>  was further divided into  <dig> smaller fragments with approximately 200-bp size in length, hyy1-a through -d . two potential yy <dig> binding sites  are located within the first fragment, hyy1-a. the four small fragments were individually analyzed in both orientations for the insulator assay. among the four small fragments, the second fragment, hyy1-b, showed the most significant and consistent insulator activity, while hyy1-a and hyy1-c also showed some insulator activity but much less than that of hyy1-b. the fourth fragment, hyy1-d, showed almost no insulator activity . to further determine the potential involvement of yy <dig> in the original insulator activity, we mutated the two yy <dig> binding sites located within the 200-bp sequence of hyy1-a and tested the mutational impact on the insulator activity. as shown in fig.  <dig> , mutations on the two yy <dig> binding sites did not change the insulator activity in either orientation. also, it is important to note that the second fragment, hyy1-b, does not contain yy <dig> binding sites and yet showed the most significant insulator activity. this suggests that yy <dig> is not the transcription factor responsible for the observed insulator activity, and further that unknown regulatory elements other than yy <dig> might be involved in the insulator activity of the peg3-dmr.

cse <dig> as a transcriptional repressor for peg3-dmr
to test the potential involvement of cse <dig> in the promoter activity of the peg3-dmr, another series of constructs lacking cse <dig> were also made and analyzed . the promoter assays with these cse1-deleted constructs derived a similar overall pattern as the previous cse1-containing constructs : an orientation-dependent transcriptional increase caused by the yy <dig> binding sites. however, the increase in transcriptional activity resulting from the inclusion of the yy <dig> binding sites in these cse1-deleted constructs was much greater than those seen in the cse1-containing constructs. in particular, construct 1+yf showed  <dig>  fold increase, while construct 1+c+yf yielded only  <dig>  fold increase. this suggests that cse <dig> may function as a repressor for the peg3-dmr. it is also noteworthy that this large increase was observed only in construct 1+yf, which contains the yy <dig> binding sites. the constructs lacking the yy <dig> binding sites, construct  <dig> and 1+c, did not show any difference in activity. these results suggest that cse <dig> may function as a context-dependent repressor together with an activator function of yy <dig> binding sites for the promoter activity of the peg3-dmr.

we further analyzed the position and orientation-dependency of this potential repressor, cse <dig>  for transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr . three modified constructs were generated and subcloned into the ires-β-geo promoterless vectors. the orientation of cse <dig> of each construct was reversed relative to the direction of peg <dig> transcription , and the position of cse <dig> was also move to the 3'-end of the peg3-dmr . as shown in fig. 3b, the construct with the reverse orientation of cse <dig>  showed about  <dig>  fold more activity relative to the activity of the control . this is similar to the initial boosting effect by the deletion of cse <dig> , confirming the orientation-dependent repressor activity of cse <dig>  two constructs with cse <dig> in the 3'-end position  showed slightly less but similar levels of activity than the control , indicating no major impact by changing the relative position of cse <dig> to the 3'-end of the peg3-dmr. thus, this series of experiments confirms the position-independent repressor role of cse <dig>  repositioning ces <dig> to the 5'-end of the peg3-dmr was also performed, but this result set was inconclusive mainly due to the fact that the 5'-side region appears to be sensitive to the insertion by any random sequences for subcloning . in sum, the above results revealed an orientation-dependent but somewhat position-independent repressor role of cse <dig> for the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr.

minimal regions of cse <dig> for the transcriptional repression of peg <dig> and usp29
the relative orientation and position of cse <dig> are well conserved among all the mammals, as shown with a subset of available genome sequences, including human, rhesus, chimpanzee, mouse, cow, and dog . this is also consistent with the results observed from the previous experiments, the orientation and yy <dig> context-dependent nature of this element . the cse <dig> sequences from these species also share high levels of sequence identity, ranging from 86% to 100%, but with a couple of single-base insertions/deletions that are specific to each species. however, the 42-bp-long cse <dig> is predicted to be too long for a single dna-binding protein. thus, we decided to further define potential minimal regions for the observed repressor activity of cse <dig>  we have performed serial mutation of 6-bp sections of cse <dig> from purine to purine and from pyrimidine to pyrimidine  . the peg3-dmr containing each mutated cse <dig> was also subcloned into the ires-β-geo promoterless vector in both directions . the constructs named with f- are positioned in the peg <dig> direction , whereas the constructs with r- are in the usp <dig> direction . these constructs were analyzed in a similar manner as above.

in the peg <dig> direction, we used two controls: the intact peg3-dmr  and the deletion peg3-dmr lacking cse <dig> . as shown in fig. 4c, most of the cse1-mutated constructs showed a slightly lower but similar activity to that of the intact control , indicating no major or only marginal effect. however, one construct  showed higher activity than the intact control , but similar to the deletion control . this indicates that the 6-bp region mutated within construct fcmut <dig> may be solely responsible for the original effect caused by the deletion of the entire region of cse <dig> . a similar series of experiments was also performed for the usp <dig> direction . three controls were also used for this series: construct 1+c+yf for the comparison between the peg <dig> and usp <dig> directions, and construct r1+c+yf  and construct r1+yf . as shown in fig. 4d, the overall transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr is much lower in the usp <dig> direction than in the peg <dig> direction . this is true for most of the tested constructs, including the cse1-mutated constructs as well as the two control constructs . nevertheless, the deletion of cse <dig> increased the transcriptional activity based on the observed difference between the two control constructs . this may be an indication that cse <dig> still be a potential repressor for the usp <dig> direction. interestingly, however, one construct  derived much higher levels of activity than the deletion construct . this is unusual since we have not detected this much transcriptional activity in the usp <dig> direction using any modified construct derived from the peg3-dmr. although this unusual increase requires further investigation, this may represent another critical minimal region for the repression in the usp <dig> direction. in sum, the above results indicate that cse <dig> may function as a repressor for both directions, peg <dig> and usp <dig>  and also that one minimal region is critical for the peg <dig> direction.

discussion
the results present in the current study demonstrate yy <dig> binding sites  as an orientation-dependent activator for the peg <dig> transcription, and cse <dig> as a repressor for peg <dig> and usp <dig> transcription. in addition, two 6-bp minimal regions have been identified within cse <dig>  one of which most likely plays a critical role for the transcriptional repression in the peg <dig> direction.

the potential roles of two conserved sequence elements in the transcriptional control of peg <dig> and usp <dig> could be summarized as depicted in fig.  <dig>  in the peg <dig> direction , the yy <dig> binding sites  function as an activator while the cse <dig> as a repressor for the peg3-dmr bidirectional promoter. one recent independent study also reported a similar observation but with much less details, highlighting the potential roles of cse <dig> and cse <dig> for peg <dig> transcription  <cit> . the activator role of the cse <dig> is orientation-dependent and also somewhat dosage-dependent based on the detection of a gradual decrease in the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr in proportion to the reduction in the numbers of yy <dig> binding sites . the repressor role of the cse <dig> is also orientation-dependent, but somewhat position-independent . it is important to note that the repressor role of the cse <dig> is only detectible when the yy <dig> binding sites are present nearby the cse <dig>  this suggests the presence of a functional, but potential antagonistic, interaction between the two conserved sequence elements, cse <dig> and cse <dig>  in the usp <dig> direction , the functional roles of two elements are not easily discernible mainly due to the very low levels of the activity with in vitro reporter assay systems. thus, the role of the cse <dig> in the usp <dig> direction is currently unknown. on the other hand, the deletion of the cse <dig> derived low but consistent levels of increase in the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr in the usp <dig> direction, suggesting that the cse <dig> might also be a repressor for the usp <dig> direction . furthermore, mutation on one minimal region within the cse <dig> showed a dramatic increase in the transcriptional activity, which is higher than the levels of the deletion construct lacking the entire the cse <dig> region. this could be an artifact stemming from a serendipitous sequence context generated by mutagenesis experiments, but it could also be a genuine effect reflecting the in vivo role of this minimal region. one possible scenario would be that the cse <dig> might bind two proteins: one protein with a repressor role bind the first 6-bp minimal region while the other protein with an activator role bind the other minimal region within the cse <dig>  in that situation, complete deletion would not dramatically increase the transcriptional activity as seen in construct r1+yf, but mutation of the first 6-bp region would relieve the repression and allow the second protein to activate the transcription in the usp <dig> direction . overall, the two cis-elements, cse <dig> and cse <dig>  appear to function as a repressor and activator, respectively, for the bidirectional promoter of the peg3-dmr.

the identification of cse <dig> as a repressor is unexpected since the expression patterns and levels of both human and mouse peg <dig> appear to be ubiquitous and very high compared to those of other genes. then, what could be biological roles of this unexpected repressor, cse <dig>  for the peg <dig> expression? two scenarios are possible based on all the observations drawn from previous studies. first, cse <dig> may be a cell type-specific repressor. despite high levels of the expression of peg <dig> in the adult brains of human and mouse, in situ hybridization results clearly demonstrated that the spatial expression of peg <dig> is limited only to a subset of neuronal cells, including cerebellar purkinje and cerebral pyramidal cells, but not to the other cells, such as cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . cse <dig> could be involved in this cell type-specific expression of peg <dig> in neuronal cells. second, cse <dig> may be a repressor responding to unknown molecular signals for cellular and developmental pathways. according to previous studies, it has been shown that the expression levels of human peg <dig> are up-regulated by the onset of the p53-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . also, the expression levels of peg <dig> are also known to be changed during muscle development as well as by the hypoxia condition in rodent brain cells  <cit> . these observations revealed dynamically changing expression patterns of peg <dig>  cse <dig> may be responsible, as a repressor, for these dynamic responses of peg <dig> to the various conditions and challenges that are faced by normal cells. the above two possibilities remain to be investigated in the near future, but the identification of cse <dig> as a repressor provides a new direction for the functional study of peg <dig> 

in contrast to cse <dig>  the identification of cse <dig>  as a transcriptional activator has been expected based on the results derived from previous studies, revealing that similar clusters of yy <dig> binding sites show an orientation-dependent increase in their transcriptional activity  <cit> . the current study confirmed, more clearly and precisely, this predicted role of cse <dig> through targeted mutations on yy <dig> binding sites . however, the activator role of cse <dig> is somewhat contradictory to the previous observations derived from sirna-based yy <dig> knockdown experiments  <cit> . yy <dig> is predicted to be a repressor based on the observed up-regulation of peg <dig> and usp <dig> against lowering the cellular levels of yy <dig> protein. these conflicting results warrant further investigation, but may reflect potential differences stemming from the use of two experimental systems. most of the promoter assays used for this study are episome-based transient experiments, and thus may or may not reflect the in vivo role of cse <dig> in chromosomal contexts. on the other hand, the effects observed from sirna-based yy <dig> knockdown experiments could be easily mired with indirect outcomes. regardless of as an activator or repressor, cse <dig> appears to be very unusual: multiple yy <dig> binding sites are scattered over the  <dig> -kb intron region without any limitations in their spacing and copy numbers. so far, we have not seen any other cis-elements for transcription that have such unusual patterns of evolutionary conservation and genomic layout. these unusual features may hint at one possibility that cse <dig> is designed for some roles other than direct contribution to transcription, such as setting up and/or maintaining dna methylation for the peg3-dmr. consistently, mutations of the cse <dig> appear to have a much milder impact on the transcriptional activity of the peg3-dmr than mutations of the cse <dig>  suggesting that cse <dig> may be the dominant player in the transcriptional regulation of peg <dig> and usp <dig>  however, it is important note that cse <dig> functions in a context-dependent manner with cse <dig> . this suggests the presence of a potential interaction between yy <dig> and other unknown factors binding to cse <dig>  and further that this interaction may determine final transcription rates for both peg <dig> and usp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, cse <dig>  functions as an orientation-dependent transcriptional activator for the peg <dig> transcription, while cse <dig> acts as a repressor for the transcription of both peg <dig> and usp <dig>
