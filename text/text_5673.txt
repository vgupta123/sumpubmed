BACKGROUND
rheumatoid arthritis  is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by chronic joint inflammation and continuous cell infiltration into the synovium. the presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies  in a large subset of patients supports the notion of an autoimmune etiology and is tightly associated with the hla-dr shared epitope alleles, which suggests that cd4+ t cells are important  <cit> . indeed, cd4+ t cells are abundant in both synovial tissue and in synovial fluid. furthermore, acpa-positive ra patients develop generally a more aggressive disease than acpa-negative patients  <cit> .

the role of cd4+ t cells in ra pathophysiology may be mediated through th <dig> effector functions, mainly ifn-γ secretion  <cit> , th <dig> activity or induction of acpa  <cit> , leading finally to bone and cartilage destruction. it has also been suggested that regulatory t cell  function may be impaired in ra  <cit> . tregs represent a crucial t cell subset in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and are significantly enriched in the synovial fluid of ra patients  <cit> .

commonly used biological therapies for ra target mainly cytokine pathways, with the exception of the b cell depleting agent rituximab and abatacept, a chimeric ctla <dig> and igg fc fusion protein modulating t cell activation. abatacept is believed to work by blocking cd <dig> costimulation and thereby interfering with t cell-apc interaction and limiting t cell activation. use of abatacept is associated with reduction in joint inflammation, pain and joint damage in patients with active ra  <cit> . recently it has been reported that abatacept shows a better clinical response in acpa-positive as compared to acpa-negative patients  <cit> . many lines of evidence suggest that the cd4+ t cell compartment is more active in acpa-positive as compared to acpa-negative ra.

in this study we compared t cell functionality in the context of acpa status in patients before and after t cell costimulation blockade by abatacept. our data demonstrate that abatacept therapy significantly reduces circulating treg frequencies, as well as effector cytokine output from th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> cells in acpa-positive patients, but not in acpa-negative patients. we further validated these findings in synovial fluid cell cultures where pharmacological doses of abatacept were added. we conclude that abatacept interferes with the full range of t cell subsets, especially t cells in acpa-positive patients.

RESULTS
unchanged levels of autoantibodies in abatacept-treated patients
for this study  <dig> patients starting on abatacept therapy were included and peripheral blood was collected at baseline and after  <dig> and  <dig> months. it has recently been reported that treatment with abatacept shows better results in acpa-positive individuals, and we therefore examined both the acpa status of our patient cohort at baseline and investigated changes in acpa levels from baseline to the  <dig> months follow-up.

in the cohort,  <dig> of  <dig> investigated patients had serum antibodies against citrullinated proteins , but we did not observe any significant changes in the acpa levels during the study period, nor did the acpa status predict clinical outcome; however this study was not intended and powered to adequately address this issue. our aim instead was to investigate the adaptive immune function.

diminished t cell effector functions in patients treated with abatacept
we started by investigating the most relevant cytokines in the context of ra, namely ifn-γ, tnf and il- <dig>  as they are all implicated in disease pathogenesis and are central in th <dig> and th <dig> function.

at baseline and six months following abatacept therapy, pbmcs from  <dig> patients were utilized for polyclonal t cell stimulation for both  <dig> hrs and  <dig> days, and subsequently intracellular cytokine stainings were performed. by this approach, each individual is its own control. representative flow cytometry stainings are depicted in figure 2a. while unstimulated cells did not produce cytokines, robust production was observed following polyclonal stimulation .

our data show that t cells of the th <dig> subset from acpa-positive patients are clearly affected by abatacept, as both tnf and ifn-γ production by cd4+ t cells were significantly decreased at the day  <dig> read-out . only minor secretion of il-17a could be observed after polyclonal stimulation, but we still saw a tendency in diminished il-17a production after treatment . in contrast, cells from acpa-negative patients displayed the opposite pattern with increased cytokine production of tnf, ifn-γ and il-17a .

our multiparameter flow approach allows a comparison of the different cytokines within each patient sample. to this end we calculated ratios of each cytokine and sample by comparing  <dig> months with baseline. again, all acpa-negative patients showed higher ratios , i.e. increased expression while the acpa-positive patients mostly displayed reduced cytokine output  . from these ratios we further determined the spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for the different cytokine combinations. a significant correlation between all examined cytokines  was detected demonstrating that the effect of ctla-ig was general rather than biased.

abatacept modulates key cytokines influencing different t helper subsets
abatacept limits the immune response by binding to cd <dig> and  <dig> on antigen-presenting cells . hence, we investigated the immune-modulatory effect of abatacept in the cell culture supernatants of polyclonal stimulated pbmcs from  <dig> abatacept-treated patients by luminex and a panel of  <dig> cytokines. we focused on cytokines relevant for the th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> subsets.

in acpa-positive patients il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were significantly diminished after abatacept treatment . il- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  -17a, -17f, - <dig>  - <dig> and tnf were also diminished, but the change did not reach statistical significance. il-1β levels tended to increase after abatacept treatment in this patient group.

for acpa-negative patients ifn-γ was significantly increased . many other examined cytokines were also increased but without reaching statistical significance.

abatacept reduces regulatory t cell frequencies in vivo
next we investigated the phenotype of tregs in patients undergoing abatacept therapy.

polychromatic flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood samples of  <dig> ra patients taken at initiation of treatment  and  <dig> months post-treatment. in addition to foxp <dig>  we also investigated helios, cd <dig> and ctla <dig> as they have been implicated in treg function in ra  <cit> , as well as cd45ra to also address naïve tregs.

a representative staining of foxp <dig> expression before and after therapy is depicted in figure 4a. a significant reduction in the frequency of foxp3+ tregs, helios+ and cd39+ t cells was observed at  <dig> months as compared to baseline . to dissect this further, we also analyzed the proportion of naïve thymus-derived tregs based on cd45ra expression in conjunction with foxp <dig>  the proportion of th17-suppressive tregs based on cd <dig> expression, as well as the expression of the treg effector molecule ctla <dig>  as shown in figure 4e-g, all treg subsets were considerably reduced at the  <dig> month time point. for  <dig> of the included patients, we also studied the treg phenotype at  <dig> months and the decline in frequencies remained low, suggesting that this is a general outcome of costimulation-blockade and not a transient effect .

abatacept reduces synovial t cell function in vitro
in rheumatoid arthritis, affected joints accumulate synovial fluid that often is very cellular with substantial fractions of both effector/memory t cells and tregs. to assess whether abatacept would also influence t cell functionality at the site of inflammation, we studied the effect of in vitro added abatacept on both synovial t effector and treg function. by this approach each sample is individually controlled by the wells without abatacept.

first we studied the effect of abatacept on synovial t cells in vitro by investigating suppression in the presence of abatacept. treg co-culture experiments were performed but no difference in suppressive capacity was seen in cultures with abatacept compared to control cultures . however, we observed a significant reduction of cd25-negative t effector cell proliferation in the presence of abatacept .

second, we studied the effects of abatacept on the whole sfmc population using polyclonal and antigen-specific stimulation. as depicted in figure 5d, abatacept significantly down-regulated the proliferative response following polyclonal  and antigen-specific  stimulation. we also observed reduced ifn-γ levels in the culture supernatants of the abatacept-treated cells .

the reduced proliferation was confined to the autoantibody-positive fraction of the patients .

discussion
abatacept is a soluble chimeric ctla <dig> protein, which binds with high affinity to the b <dig> molecules cd <dig> and cd <dig> expressed on antigen-presenting cells. the outcome of this blockade could be manifold, including changes of activity and lifespan of apcs and limiting the activation and re-activation of cd4+ t cells. in the present study we demonstrate a significant down-regulation of all key t cell effector subsets including th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> by abatacept. we saw these effects in the acpa-positive patient subset, but not in the acpa-negative patients. further, we could show a general decrease in frequencies of regulatory t cells.

today it is widely recognized that acpa-positive and acpa-negative ra are distinct disease sub-entities as these two phenotypes demonstrate major differences in terms of hla-association, other genetic and environmental risk factors, clinical disease phenotype and treatment response and probably in molecular pathogenesis as well  <cit> .

clinical response to ctla4-ig  can be different early in disease as compared to patients with established disease. it has also been shown that sero-conversion  is possible in early ra patients treated with abatacept   <cit>  suggesting that abatacept may impact on autoantibody formation. however, we could not detect any difference in acpa levels after  <dig> months of treatment, but our cohort consists of patients with “long-standing” disease who have failed several biologicals prior to starting with abatacept. interestingly it was recently published that in a cohort similar to ours , acpa status was an independent factor positively correlating to therapy response, where acpa-positive ra patients responded better to abatacept treatment than acpa-negative  <cit> . still, abatacept is approved for use in both acpa-positive and acpa-negative patients and patients in our study who demonstrated a clinical response towards abatacept were both acpa-positive and negative. this illustrates how therapeutic progress is possible even though the role of t cells in acpa-positive vs. acpa-negative ra is not  understood.

importantly, our study aimed at dissecting the outcome of costimulation blockade by abatacept on a cell population level. it was not powered to address clinical outcome or identify biomarkers for therapy response. in particular the number of acpa-negative patients in our cohort was low, reflecting a typical ra cohort of patients with long-standing disease.

to address the question of which cells are affected by abatacept therapy, we studied both peripheral blood samples of patients undergoing therapy as well as synovial fluid cells from disease-active joints where abatacept has been added to the cultures. recently another study focusing on t helper cells in affected joints was published. consistent with our data, they showed that ctla4-ig leads to reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines ifn-γ and il- <dig> but they also reported increased levels of il- <dig> and tgf-β. acpa status was not reported  <cit> .

in our study we investigated cytokine production representative for different t cell subsets , utilizing pbmcs of abatacept-treated patients by two different methodological approaches. strikingly, a reduction in th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines in acpa-positive patients was seen, but not in acpa-negative patients. the observed down-regulation of ifn-γ is supported by a previous study by cutolo et al. showing that abatacept in vitro can decrease synovial macrophage activation when co-cultured with t cells accompanied with a decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> and tnf  <cit> . a few years ago, buch et al. investigated synovial biopsies from established ra and could demonstrate a decrease of number of b cells after  <dig> weeks of therapy and reduced mrna levels for ifn-γ  <cit> . the acpa status was not reported in these studies.

we also explored the regulatory t cell compartment  since it is well established that optimal treg functionality is dependent on costimulation as antigen-specific tregs are the most efficient suppressor cells  <cit> . we have recently shown that synovial tregs proliferate in vivo  <cit> , suggesting that tregs in the rheumatic joint interact with their cognate antigens. in the same study, we also showed that biological therapies targeting tnf and il-6r could lead to increased suppression by synovial tregs  <cit> . this is in line with studies performed on tregs in the circulation of ra patients  <cit> . however, we could not detect increased suppressive capacity, even though the t effector proliferation rate was reduced by abatacept. this observation supports the importance of costimulation for treg function. thus, the clinical efficacy seen with abatacept is not due to increased treg functionality.

the focus of the phenotype study was on natural tregs expressing the lineage marker foxp <dig>  and subsets thereof. overall we found a general reduction of foxp3+ natural tregs in the periphery, supporting the data by alvarez-quiroga et al, who demonstrated reduced treg frequencies based on foxp <dig> and cd <dig> expression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that abatacept has a significant impact on t effector functions of the th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> subsets and that effects were predominantly seen in the acpa-positive patient subset. treg frequencies were diminished in the periphery, however no significant changes in function were seen in synovial in vitro co-culture essays. this data gives further evidence that ra has to be seen as a disease with several different sub-entities, and supports the view that acpa-positive and acpa-negative patients represent immunologically distinct disease phenotypes, with repercussions for treatment strategies.
