BACKGROUND
the huge phenotypic variation in domestic dog breeds is the result of their unique evolutionary history, which involved two main phases. firstly, the domestication of dogs from wolves, likely more than  <dig>  years ago, involved selection for phenotypes necessary for life with humans . subsequently, in the last few hundred years, a huge variety of breeds were formed from the ancestral dog gene pool, a process that involved extreme population bottlenecks and strong artificial selection. these processes have left impacts on patterns of genetic variation, including long blocks of linkage disequilibrium   <cit> , increased incidence of deleterious mutations  <cit>  and a high prevalence of inherited disease that varies specific to dog breeds.

recent studies have identified specific mutations involved in both phases of dog domestication. these studies give insight into the nature and timing of the dog domestication process and selective pressures involved  <cit> . scanning the genome for regions of extreme fst between dogs and wolves and reduced heterozygosity in dogs, consistent with selective sweeps, has identified genetic variants that were likely selected during the descent of modern dogs. these include genes involved in starch digestion and brain function, which may underlie adaptation to new diet and behavioural changes  <cit> . studies of genomic variation among dog breeds have also uncovered a catalogue of variants underlying their extreme morphological variation and also potentially behaviour and physiology . these include shape of ears, snout and limbs, size, tails, coat type and colour. the simplified genetic basis of normal and pathological inherited traits that segregate within dog breeds coupled with long blocks of ld also makes them an outstanding resource for genetic mapping using genome wide association studies . the genetic basis of a large number of traits has been identified by taking advantage of these features  <cit> .

ear phenotypes are of particular interest because phenotypes of many domestic animals are floppy  compared with their wild ancestors, including cattle, goats, rabbits and pigs. the presence of drop ears as a common correlate of domestication is argued to be related to pleiotropic effects of selection for tameness  <cit> . in support of this, selective breeding experiments to produce tame foxes also resulted in the emergence of drop ears and a suite of other peadomorphic characteristics  <cit> . present day dog breeds show huge variation in ear morphology, from pricked ears seen in german shepherds to large hanging drop ears of basset hounds. ear morphology is included in breed standards and has clearly been under strong artificial selection for these various divergent types.

a region on cfa <dig>  harbours a locus with highly divergent snp frequencies between dog breeds. fst values in this region are among the highest in the genome . across-breed gwas identified a strong association with ear type in this region. there is also a weaker association with body mass. the strongest correlation with size between dog breeds has been found to be on cfa <dig>  close to the igf <dig> gene  <cit>  and the region on cfa <dig> is secondary to this  <cit> . derived variants at six loci, including these two have been shown to account for  <dig>  % of variance in weight among breeds with standard weights   <cit> . whereas a single locus in the cfa <dig> region correlates strongly with the ear phenotype of almost all drop and prick ear breeds  <cit> , body mass correlates with a variant at high frequency in a subset of small breeds  <cit> . the strongest associations with both body mass and ear type identified from gwas lie in a region 3′  of the methionine sulfoxide reductase  gene and 5′  of the high-mobility group at-hook  <dig>  gene  <cit> . interestingly the region also shows weaker correlation with boldness  <cit> . however the biological relevance of this correlation is difficult to evaluate, as it is based on subjective phenotype, which showed a strong covariation with ear type in previous analysis  <cit> . it is clear however that patterns of variation in this region indicate that it is a key region controlling variation in morphology among dog breeds, and potentially also important for mediating phenotypic changes that occurred during dog domestication.

here we identified variants that are potential candidates for controlling phenotypic variation in ear morphology and body mass within this region on canine chromosome  <dig>  we first performed targeted sequencing of the region in five pools of samples, each from a single dog breed, that differ in ear morphology and body mass. we compared patterns of variation in these sequences with those obtained from whole genome resequencing of a further five pools of dogs from various breeds and one pool of wolves. this enabled us to identify candidate snps that we then genotyped in a larger panel of dogs from various breeds, which allowed inference of haplotypes with strongest correlation to phenotype. we also analysed patterns of variation in this region in dogs compared with wolves and show that it has evidence for selection during dog domestication and identified a cluster of wolf-dog fixations, which could represent snps under selection during domestication.

RESULTS
across-breed gwas identifies interval on chromosome 10
we first tested for associations with body mass and ear type using a set of  <dig> samples from  <dig> breeds  typed using the caninehd snp array . we performed a gwas for ear type comparing  <dig> drop ear breeds ,  <dig> prick ear breeds  and  <dig> intermediate ear breeds . we estimated genome-wide significance using the breed permutation procedure used in ref.  <cit> . this method accurately determines significance correcting for different sample sizes of each breed. in total,  <dig> snps reach genome-wide significance. of these,  <dig> are found between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on cfa <dig> , with the other on cfa <dig> . the snp with the strongest association with ear type is located at cfa10: <dig> , <dig> , which lies between the msrb <dig> and hmga <dig> genes .table  <dig> samples used in gwas with ear and body mass phenotypes

we next examined the association with body mass, measured in kilograms, using average mass for each breed  using a quantitative association study of all  <dig> breeds. we identified  <dig> snps with genome wide significance on cfa <dig> within a narrow region  <dig>  -  <dig>  mb. the most associated snp is at cfa15: <dig> , <dig> . these snps overlap the igf <dig> locus previously implicated in body mass variation among dog breeds  <cit> . however, a secondary peak is observed within the region on cfa <dig> also associated with ear type. one snp in this region reaches genome wide significance , which lies between msrb <dig> and hmga <dig> .

there is no significant difference in average body mass between breeds of different ear types in our dataset . the average body mass of drop ear, prick ear and intermediate ear breeds is  <dig>  kg,  <dig>  kg and  <dig>  kg respectively. this indicates that the associations between body mass and ear type in the cfa <dig> region are independent of each other. we also performed gwas for body mass within each of the three categories of ear type . among  <dig> prick ear breeds there was a strong genome wide significant association with body mass on cfa <dig> near the igf <dig> gene  but the signals within the cfa <dig> region were abolished, without any suggestive signals . among the  <dig> drop ear breeds, there was no significant association anywhere in the genome including the cfa <dig> and cfa <dig> regions. however, among  <dig> breeds with variable or intermediate ear types, the strongest signal was seen in the cfa <dig> region, with the highest significance near a snp identified previously using all breeds . these results confirm that the genetic association with body mass is independent of ear type. the lack of association with the cfa <dig> region in prick and drop ear breeds is likely influenced by the low number of very small breeds with either prick or drop ears in this dataset .

in addition to correlations with morphology, previous studies have identified this cfa <dig> region as being one of the most highly differentiated among breeds  <cit> . in the same dataset of  <dig> breeds, a region of  <dig>  mb  contains  <dig> snps with fst >  <dig>  and minor allele frequency >15 %, representing the second-longest such stretch of snps with high fst in the genome. the snps with highest fst in this region are cfa10: <dig> , <dig> , which is highly associated with body mass and cfa10: <dig> , <dig>  with is highly associated with ear type . the extreme population differentiation in this region is indicative of strong artificial selection.

analysis of sequence variation in 3 mb encompassing the critical interval
the evidence above suggests that a critical region on cfa <dig> harbours genetic variants responsible for ear type and body mass and has experienced selection due to the creation and maintenance of different dog breeds. we therefore decided to assay sequence variation in a 3 mb interval encompassing this region  in breeds with a variety of phenotypes in order to identify candidate genetic variants that control this variation. this region was selected to encompass the 1–2 mb highly differentiated interval defined by fst identified by refs  <cit> . using sequence capture followed by sequencing of a lane of illumina hi-seq per library, we sequenced this interval in  <dig> pools of dogs each containing  <dig> samples from the same breed, resulting in average coverage of  <dig> x. we chose breeds with either drop or non-drop ears that were fixed for the appropriate alleles at associated snps in the gwas analyses and the segregation of associated markers presented in ref.  <cit> . these consisted of two small breeds with non-drop ears , one large breed with non-drop ears , and two large breeds with drop ears . the two small breeds are expected to harbour the small mass variant according to the results from gwas presented above and the segregation of associated markers presented in ref.  <cit> . we refer to this as the sequence capture  dataset.table  <dig> samples used in resequencing studies with numbers of snps identified using stringent cutoff 


sc pools

wgs pools

a <dig> of each breed



we identified common snps in the sc dataset based on a cutoff of minor allele frequency > <dig>  and then inferred the frequency of each snp in each pool in all samples based on proportion of reads matching each allele . we identified  <dig>  variable snps in the sc data using this approach. each snp was then classified as fixed for reference allele, fixed for non-reference allele, polymorphic or uninformative in each pool  using a selection of both stringent and loose cutoffs to define fixation. from among these snps we identified candidates that segregated with the body mass or ear phenotypes. in order for a snp to be considered a candidate, it was necessary for all pools representing a particular phenotype to be fixed for the same allele. in total,  <dig> ear type candidates and  <dig> body mass candidates were identified from the sc data.fig.  <dig> patterns of snp variation in a 3 mb region on cfa <dig>  the first  <dig> bars show variation in the sequence capture  pools of single breeds and the next  <dig> bars show variation in the whole genome sequencing pools . red lines represent snp positions that are fixed for a non-reference allele in a particular pool, grey lines represent snp positions that cannot be confidently assessed due to low coverage. sites that are polymorphic within a breed, or that match the reference allele are not marked. the bottom  <dig> bars represent snps that display patterns of fixation that matches phenotypic variation. candidate snps for controlling variation in body mass  ear type  and those that are fixed for alternate alleles in all dogs compared to wolves  are shown. the location of protein coding genes in the region are also shown, which were identified by mapping human refseq genes onto the canfam <dig>  dog assembly. genes are labelled +/− according to direction of transcription. ear and body mass candidates are concentrated in a region between the msrb <dig> and hmga <dig> genes, whereas a cluster of dog-wolf fixations is found within the msrb <dig> gene



we next compared patterns of variation in snps identified in the sequence capture sequences with reads from whole genome sequencing  mapped to the same region in  <dig> pools of dog samples from one or more breeds, and one pool of wolf samples presented by axelsson et al.  <cit> . all of the dog pools comprised large breeds. two of these dog pools contained only drop ear breeds, one contained a single prick ear breed and two contained breeds with a mixture of ear types . the wolf pool was considered as having a large body mass and prick ear phenotype. only positions that were variable in the sequence capture pools were considered in the wgs pools, which were also defined as fixed for reference allele, fixed for non-reference allele, polymorphic or uninformative.

we utilized patterns of segregation in the wgs pools to rule out candidate snps from the sc pools that showed patterns of segregation inconsistent with phenotype. snp candidates were filtered if alleles matching the incorrect phenotype based on the sc data were observed in any wgs pool . the remaining candidate snps are mainly concentrated in a 500 kb region between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, which is downstream of the msrb <dig> gene and encompasses the hmga <dig> gene. a cluster of seven candidate snps for ear type are found immediately downstream of the msrb <dig> gene between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb .

we performed an analysis based on read depth in order to identify putative copy number variants  that associated with phenotype but did not identify any such cases. we used the sc data to scan the 500 kb associated region and flanking sequence using 100 bp windows to identify asymmetrical read depth between pools that could result from copy number variation . we inspected the pileup of reads around  <dig> regions with more than twofold variation in read depth or where one or more pool had no coverage using integrative genome viewer . of these,  <dig> regions mapped to repetitive elements, including two that mapped to simple repeats and  <dig> that mapped to line/sine elements . although some of these may represent true cnvs related to presence/absence of repeat elements, the patterns are consistent with poorly mapped reads. out of all the regions only  <dig> have some degree of conservation and none of these show patterns of relative read coverage consistent with a correlation to either the ear or body mass phenotypes. there are therefore no strong candidates among these regions that may indicate structural variation governing phenotype.

genotyping of candidate snps identifies haplotypes associated with both traits
we selected  <dig> snps for further genotyping including all of the candidate snps identified using the strict criteria presented above, augmented with additional snps that were candidates at lower thresholds for fixation. all candidates for ear and body mass were included from the strict dataset and in total we genotyped  <dig> body mass candidates and  <dig> ear candidates . we genotyped  <dig> samples from  <dig> breeds including  <dig> with prick ears,  <dig> with intermediate ears and  <dig> with drop ears  and analysed association between allele frequencies and phenotype . figure 1c shows significance of correlations between body mass and ear type across all snps .table  <dig> haplotypes identified in genotyped breeds

bphalène is a breed closely related to pappillon with comparatively more dropped ears. norfolk terrier is drop ear breed closely related to norwich terrier with comparatively more dropped ears



we identified seven snps within a ~60 kb window at cfa10: <dig> - <dig>  mb, which lies immediately 3′ of the gene msrb <dig>  that are strongly associated with ear type. a larger number of snps showed associations with body mass across a large  interval  that encompasses the ear type region and extends into the 5′ end of the gene hmga <dig> . the associations with body mass are weaker but extend across a much larger region. the presence of multiple snps with similar levels of association across this region is indicative of them being in ld. this additional genotyping therefore enables us to further filter the list of candidate variants from the resequencing study, and identifies multiple genetic variants associated with ear type and body mass within a reduced interval.

we next repeated the associations with body mass in subsets of data divided according to ear type . consistent with the previous equivalent gwas analysis  the strongest associations are observed within the  <dig> intermediate ear breeds, with associations shown across the same set of snps as observed across all breeds. weaker associations with body mass are identified among  <dig> prick ear breeds, whereas there are no notable associations with body mass in this region among drop ear breeds although the latter result is likely due to the low number of small drop ear breeds in the dataset . these results confirm that variation within this region correlates with body mass independently of ear type, suggesting that these two phenotypes are controlled by separate genetic variants within the region.

we selected  <dig> snps with the strongest associations to ear type  and/or body mass  spanning 340 kb and inferred haplotypes present in each sample at these snps. we were able to infer the haplotypes present in  <dig> of  <dig> samples. in total, we inferred  <dig> different haplotypes. the six haplotypes that are present at frequencies > <dig>  % in the dataset are shown in fig. 3a and the occurrence of these haplotypes in each breed is shown in table  <dig> . drop ear breeds predominantly carry haplotype d, which occurs very rarely in other breeds . this haplotype carries the minor allele for a cluster of ear-type-associated snps in a 5′ portion of the interval. haplotypes s <dig> and s <dig> occur predominantly in small breeds without drop ears, and are rare in other breeds. these haplotypes carry the minor alleles for a cluster of body-mass-associated snps in the 3′ portion of the interval. haplotypes l <dig> and l <dig> are most common in larger breeds without drop ears, but are also present in other breeds.figure  <dig> haplotype structure inferred across  <dig> snps highly associated with ear type or body mass and patterns of linkage disequilibrium. a locations of snps on the haplotype relative to the msrb <dig> and hmga <dig> genes. snps and haplotypes associated with ear type are highlighted yellow whereas those associated only with body mass are highlighted orange. only haplotypes present > <dig> times in the dataset are shown. b pairwise estimates of linkage disequilibrium measured by |d’|



these observations suggest that the d haplotype harbours one or more variants that cause drop ears whereas the s haplotypes harbour one or more variants that cause low body mass. the association between body mass and haplotype variation in this region is weaker than with ear type, which is likely due to the presence of additional modifiers elsewhere in the genome, most notably at the igf <dig> locus  <cit> . recombinant haplotypes that carry subsets of the snps associated with ear type and body mass are observed, although extremely rarely  and homozygotes are not observed. breeds that have both drop ears and low body mass harbour a mixture of d and s haplotypes  suggesting that this phenotype is not caused by fixation of a haplotype possessing both the drop ear and low body mass variants.

we analysed pairwise ld between the  <dig> associated snps using both |d’|  and r <dig> . these analyses reveal two blocks of near-perfect ld corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ snp clusters that associate with ear type and body mass respectively. within these clusters, mean |d’| between snps is  <dig>  and mean r <dig> is  <dig> . the two blocks are also in strong ld with each other measured by |d’| . this reflects the apparent lack of recombinant haplotypes in the region . however, correlation between snps within these two haplotype blocks measured by r <dig> is lower  which reflects the observations that there are three major haplotypes and that the alleles associated with ear type and body mass are rarely found on the same haplotype and therefore not strongly correlated.

the breeds we genotyped included two pairs of breeds that are known to be closely related but vary to some extent in ear type. the norwich terrier has more pricked ears than the closely related norfolk terrier. these two breeds were considered to be the same breed by kennel clubs until the 1960–1970s. the papillon has more pricked ears compared to the phalène breed, and the two forms may appear in the same litter. there was however clearly no differentiation of this region between these pairs of breeds and the most ear-associated snps were homozygous for the prick ear type in all four of these breeds . the norwich and norfolk terriers both predominantly possess the s <dig> haplotype whereas the phalène and pappillon both possess a mixture of l <dig> and s <dig> haplotypes . it is therefore highly unlikely that genetic variation in this region controls differences in ear type between these specific breeds.

comparison with genetic variation in wolves reveals putative signals of selection
we next analysed the cfa <dig> region for signatures of selective sweeps. we estimated levels of heterozygosity in dogs and fst between dogs and wolves across the genome in 40 kb windows . one region downstream of msrb <dig> and upstream of hmga <dig> exhibits heterozygosity below the 1 % percentile and fst above the 99 % percentile compared to 40 kb windows in the entire dog genome , which is potentially indicative of a selective sweep. the region  <dig> – <dig>  mb shows very high heterozygosity which is consistent with the presence of two haplotypes corresponding to the drop and prick eared phenotypes in this region. we leveraged the data from both sequence capture and wgs sequences to identify genetic variants that were fixed in dogs and wolves in this region . we identified  <dig> such variants within the 3 mb sequenced region, of which  <dig> are clustered within  <dig>  kb region at cfa10: <dig> , <dig> -  <dig> , <dig> within the msrb <dig> gene. the density of snps within this region is  <dig>  kb/snp whereas in the rest of the region it is  <dig>  kb/snp . these snps are close to the cluster of snps that most strongly correlate with ear type .fig.  <dig> patterns of genetic variation and candidate snps. a variation in heterozygosity within dogs and fst between wolves and dogs in a 3 mb region on cfa <dig> encompassing the critical interval associated with ears and body mass. both statistics were measured in 40 kb windows. horizontal dotted lines represent cutoff values for percentiles across the entire genome. a region with extremely high fst and extremely low heterozygosity  is marked by a vertical dotted line. b detailed view of the snps most associated with ear type, which are clustered downstream of the msrb <dig> gene and the snps that are fixed for alternate alleles between wolves and dogs, including a cluster of snps within the msrb <dig> gene. the ear type associated snps are located at sites that map to lincrna transcripts in the human genome, whereas the cluster of dog-wolf fixed snps are found in introns of msrb <dig>  also shown are the gerp conserved elements derived from a  <dig> eutherian mammal alignment  <cit> 



functional candidates
we have identified sets of snps strongly associated with ear type and body mass respectively and another set which have highly differentiated allele frequencies between dogs and wolves. figure 4b shows the location of seven ear-type-associated and  <dig> dog-wolf differentiated snps in the vicinity of the msrb <dig> gene. the ear type associated snps in the region cfa10: <dig> – <dig>  mb are immediately downstream of the msrb <dig> gene  and 260 kb upstream of hmga <dig> .

msrb3-catalyzed reduction of methionine sulfoxides to methionine is essential for hearing  <cit>  and a non-synonymous substitution in this gene causes deafness and expression of msrb <dig> in the inner ear is localized in the auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia. there is therefore evidence that msrb <dig> may be involved in ear function, and the snps could potentially exert their functional effects on ear morphology by modifying its expression, although a putative mechanism is elusive. we do not identify overlap between any of the snps and evolutionary constrained elements. likewise, none of the snps are located within a known coding-region. interestingly, although previous rna-seq experiments across multiple tissues have not identified transcription in this region  <cit> , all seven snps lie within the coordinates of human lincrna candidates mapped into dog. these variants could therefore be involved in regulation of gene expression by lincrna, and could potentially affect expression of msrb <dig> or hmga <dig>  the cluster of dog-wolf fixed snps within the msrb <dig> gene is restricted to intronic regions and the snps show no overlap with conserved elements or coding nucleotides. any functional consequences of these snps are most likely to be regulatory.

snps across the entire 340 kb haplotype region show similar levels of association with body mass. these include a cluster of snps within an intron of the hmga <dig> gene, which is a strong candidate for involvement in body mass variation and correlates with several morphological phenotypes including height in humans  <cit> . one of these snps, cfa10: <dig> , <dig>  is found within a conserved element and is a good candidate for influencing body mass by affecting expression of hmga <dig>  in the human genome, this snp maps to a position  overlapping a h3k27ac mark in huvec cells, suggesting a function in endothelial cells. it is also found within a dnasei hypersensitive cluster observed in several cell types and an rna polymerase ii transcription factor binding site assayed by chip-seq  <cit>  in multiple cell lines suggesting that it affects transcription.

discussion
the genetic basis of phenotypic variation is simplified in dogs due to inbreeding and strong artificial selection for variants with large effect  <cit> . one of the challenges of identifying genetic variants for certain traits is that they may be correlated with each other as regions with high divergence between breeds often show correlations with many phenotypes, some of which may be spurious due to co-occurrence of phenotypes either by chance or due to selection for specific combinations of traits. here we confirm that a previously identified region on canine chromosome  <dig> associates with differences in ear type and body mass between dog breeds. our detailed characterisation of this region indicates that it harbours at least two distinct genetic variants that independently influence these traits.

our analysis suggests that genetic variants controlling two traits are found on haplotypes that span a 340 kb region on chromosome  <dig> encompassing a region 3′ of msrb <dig> and all of hmga <dig>  however, despite the presence of strong associations with phenotype and a highly localized signal, the number and identity of variants in the region with functional effects that control body mass and ears is unclear. dissection of the haplotype structure in this region is consistent with the hypothesis that two tightly linked loci control the ear type and body mass traits independently. a number of snps immediately downstream of msrb <dig> are good candidates for controlling ear type, whereas snps within the hmga <dig> gene are good candidates for influencing body mass.

the correlations between body mass and variation in the hmga <dig> locus are consistent between this study and another that assayed variation at this locus  <cit> . interestingly, the best marker reported by ref.  <cit>   was not identified in our study due to extremely low read depth in its vicinity. conversely, all but two of our top nine highly associated body mass snps  are not identified by ref.  <cit> . a cluster of three of the most associated snps that we identified upstream of hmga <dig>  lie within an  <dig>  kb interval where no snps were identified by ref.  <cit> . a second cluster of four highly associated snps that we identified within the hmga <dig> gene  lie with a  <dig>  kb interval where no snps were found by ref.  <cit> . one of the snps shared by both studies  shows a highly similar pattern of segregation to best snp in ref.  <cit> . out of the  <dig> small breeds that we inferred haplotypes for,  <dig> were also genotyped at the best marker reported by ref.  <cit> . the results were consistent with the derived variant at the best marker being found on the small haplotype reported here. additional genotyping and functional studies will be necessary to determine which variants in the region directly influence body mass.

these two genes are both strong candidates for involvement in phenotypic variation. the msrb <dig> gene encodes zinc-containing methionine sulfoxide reductase b <dig>  which catalyses the reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine  <cit> . it is involved in stress resistance and longevity in drosophila  <cit>  and has a antimicrobial effect  <cit> . a nonsynonymous mutation has been identified that causes deafness in a human family and the expression of msrb <dig> in the inner ear is essential for hearing  <cit> . it is however, unknown if it exerts an effect on outer ear morphology. gwas have identified variants within msrb <dig> that are associated with the timing of primary tooth development during infancy  <cit> . tooth development is a highly heritable and interacts with the development of the entire craniofacial complex  <cit> . differences in dna methylation in the promoter region of msrb <dig> correlate with gestational age at birth  <cit> . the associations with craniofacial development and hearing therefore suggest msrb <dig> as a highly plausible candidate for influencing ear development.

the snps with highest association to ear type are found outside protein coding genes, and are not known to be within transcribed elements in dog. however, the orthologous region in the human genome contains several lincrnas. closer inspection of the cdna evidence from which these lincrna models were curated suggests expression in multiple tissues. if these lincrnas are genuine transcripts in dog, it is possible that they could affect expression of one or both of the flanking genes, as has been described for other lincrnas in human and mouse  <cit> . a targeted analysis of expression during developmental stages relevant for ear development would be necessary to demonstrate their existence and potential connection with ear phenotype.

several candidate variants for affecting body mass are found within an intron of hmga <dig>  <cit>  which is implicated as a regulator of transcription and in the proliferation and differentiation of cells during development  <cit> . the expression of hmga <dig> in adult tissues is commonly associated with both malignant and benign tumour formation  <cit>  and a role in adipogenesis and mesenchymal differentiation  <cit>  has been suggested. variants in hmga <dig> have been identified that are associated with height  <cit> , head circumference  <cit>  intracranial volume  <cit>  and permanent dentition  <cit> . this gene is also therefore a strong candidate for influencing both ear morphology and body mass. one of the snps associated with body mass is found within a conserved element within an intron of hmga <dig> that is likely to coincide with transcription factor binding activity that could affect expression of this gene.

we cannot fully rule out the possibility that a single locus with multiple alleles, such as a copy number variant, that we have been unable to detect controls both body mass and ear type. one drawback of assaying variation by using sequence capture and mapping of short reads to the reference genome is that we are unable to comprehensively assay copy number variation caused by insertion of sequence not present in the reference. it is therefore possible that structural variation involved in phenotypic variation is undetected.

other loci elsewhere in the genome are also likely to influence ear type and body mass. in this study, ear type was considered a quantitative trait, and breeds that did not clearly have marked drop or prick type ears were classified as intermediate. it is possible that more detailed ear classification schemes could identify other loci that influence ear morphology using a gwas approach. furthermore, variants in at least six other loci associate with small size  <cit> . here we find that the variants that associate with small size and drop ears in the cfa <dig> region very rarely occur on the same haplotype, and such recombinant haplotypes are not common in in the small, drop ear breeds in our dataset. this indicates the importance of other loci in determining both body mass and ear type in dog breeds.

we gained further insight into the evolutionary forces affecting the cfa <dig> region by analysing levels of heterozygosity and fst compared with wolves compared to the rest of the genome. in the region close to the drop ear associated snps there is very high heterozygosity in a heterogeneous sample of breeds, reflecting the presence of multiple snps with highly divergent frequencies between breeds. however, the regions immediately surrounding the associated interval exhibit extremely low levels of variation in dogs and high fst, consistent with selection at domestication. we therefore hypothesize that these regions harbour one or more variants affected by selection related to dog domestication. this suggests that genetic variation in this region may have experienced two phases of selection: one related to dog domestication, which led to dog specific morphologies and/or behaviour, and another accompanying breed creation that led to differences in body mass and ear morphology between dog breeds. it is however, unlikely that the specific drop ear haplotype identified in this study was selected during early domestication, as it is associated with a relatively extreme phenotype that is exhibited only by a subset of breeds.

the findings presented here demonstrate how response to artificial selection in domestic species can be affected by the genetic architecture of the trait under selection. there are a large number of examples of traits that commonly appear together. for example, there is an association between white coats and deafness in both cats and dogs  <cit> . chickens with “frizzle feathers” that curl outward rather than lying flat against their bodies also have physiological abnormalities and lay fewer eggs compared to wild type  <cit> . hair greying with age is associated with susceptibility to melanoma in the horse  <cit> . such observations are generally expected to be due to pleiotropy at single loci and in some cases the identity of specific variants have been identified. for example mutations in α-keratin  produce the pleiotropic effects in chicken  <cit>  and a cis-acting regulatory mutation in intron  <dig> of stx <dig>  is responsible for the pigmentation and melanoma susceptibility phenotypes in horse  <cit> .

drop ears are observed in several domestic animals including dogs, rabbits, cattle, pigs and goats and are often associated with other traits such as piebald coats, curly tails and smaller skulls. a similar suite of traits has also been observed in foxes selected for tameness in the classic farm-fox experiment  <cit> . the leading explanation for these associations between traits is that they are due to pleiotropy, which implies that genetic variants affecting behaviour also have effects on morphology. however, in some cases, such associations between different traits can be produced by genetic linkage between more than one variant that govern them separately. this study has revealed an example of this case, where variants governing body mass and ear type are in genetic linkage.

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterised a region on canine chromosome  <dig> that contains genetic variants that affect ear type and body mass. we suggest candidate mutations for both of these traits and provide further evidence that the region may have been under selection during dog domestication. this study demonstrates how the presence of linked variants influencing different traits could limit the combinations of phenotypes available for selection. such genetic correlations restrict the palette available for both natural and artificial selection to work with to produce desired phenotypes and can reduce the rate of genetic adaptation.
