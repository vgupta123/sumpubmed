BACKGROUND
the estimation of phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms has received considerable attention during the past decade with the rapid increase in availability of dna sequence data from a wide diversity of markers and taxa . most previous molecular phylogenetic studies of flowering plants have relied on one to several genes from the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and/or nuclear genomes, though most of these analyses were based on chloroplast markers. these efforts have resolved the relationships among many of the major lineages of angiosperms but a number of outstanding issues remain  <cit> . completely sequenced chloroplast genomes provide a rich source of data that can be used to address phylogenetic questions at deep nodes in the angiosperm tree  <cit> . the use of dna sequences from all of the shared chloroplast genes provides many more characters for phylogeny reconstruction compared to previous studies that have relied on only one or a few genes to address the same questions. however, the whole genome approach can result in misleading estimates of relationships because of limited taxon sampling  <cit>  and the use of incorrect models of sequence evolution in concatenated datasets  <cit> . thus, there is a growing interest in expanding the taxon sampling of complete chloroplast genome sequences and developing new evolutionary models for phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast sequences  <cit>  to overcome these concerns.

the rosids represent the largest of the eight major clades of core eudicots and include nearly one third of all flowering plants. single and multi-gene phylogenies of rosids have identified seven major clades, however, relationships among these clades remain unresolved  <cit> . one of these unresolved clades includes the vitaceae, which includes grape, an important crop plant. the phylogenetic position of vitaceae has been controversial for many years. some previous classifications place the family within the rhamnales in the subclass rosidae  <cit> . more recent molecular phylogenies based on one to four genes provided weak support for the placement of vitaceae sister to the caryophylales  <cit> , asterids  <cit> , saxifragales  <cit> , dilleniaceae  <cit> , or to the rosids  <cit> . thus, the phylogenetic relationship of the grape family to core eudicots remains unresolved.

in this article, we report on the complete sequence of the chloroplast genome of grape . in addition to describing the organization of the chloroplast genome, we present results of phylogenetic analyses of dna sequences for  <dig> genes from grape and  <dig> other angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including eight other members of the rosid clade. the phylogenetic analyses provide insights into the relationship of vitaceae to other rosids and illustrate the importance of taxon sampling and analytical method on addressing phylogenetic questions using whole genome sequences. the complete chloroplast genome sequence of vitis also provides valuable data for using chloroplast genetic engineering for this economically important crop plant  <cit> .

RESULTS
size, gene content, order and organization of the grape chloroplast genome
the complete chloroplast genome of grape is  <dig>  bp in length  and includes a pair of inverted repeats  <dig>  bp long, separated by a small and a large single copy region of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the grape chloroplast genome has  <dig> unique genes,  <dig> of which are duplicated in the ir, for a total of  <dig> genes . there are four ribosomal and  <dig> distinct trna genes; seven of the trna genes and all rrna genes are duplicated within the ir. there are  <dig> intron-containing genes,  <dig> of which contain one intron, and two of which contain two introns. overall, the gene order in the grape chloroplast genome is identical to that of tobacco. the grape genome is  <dig> % gc and  <dig> % at;  <dig> % of the genome corresponds to coding regions and  <dig> % to non-coding regions, including introns and intergenic spacers.

repeat structure
repeat analysis identified  <dig> repetitive elements ,  <dig> of which are direct repeats and  <dig> of which are inverted repeats . eight direct repeats and  <dig> inverted repeats were  <dig> –  <dig> bp long, and the longest direct repeats were  <dig> bp. the majority of the repeats were located within intergenic spacer regions, intron sequences and ycf <dig>  two distinct  <dig> bp direct repeats were found in ycf <dig>  which is located in the ir. additionally, a  <dig> bp direct repeat was located in psaa and psab, and a shorter,  <dig> bp direct repeat was found in two serine transfer-rna  genes that recognize different codons; trns-gcu and trns-uga. lastly, a 31-bp direct repeat was identified within trng-gcc in the ir, and a 39-bp direct repeat was found three times in the grape chloroplast genome, with a single occurrence in an intergenic spacer region, and also in the ycf <dig> and ndha introns.

rna variable sites in grape chloroplast transcripts
comparison of dna and est sequences for chloroplast-encoded proteins retrieved from genbank showed that most photosynthetic machinery and ribosomal subunit genes have 100% sequence identity with their respective est sequences. eleven non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, resulting in a total of nine amino acid changes, were identified for atpi, clpp, matk, petb, petd, psba and rpl <dig> compared to the ests . also, there were five synonymous substitutions. in the cases of non-synonymous substitutions, all genes experienced one nucleotide substitution except clpp, which had five variable sites. lastly, in atpi, clpp and psba the nucleotide substitutions had an impact on the hydropathy of the amino acid, changing it from aliphatic to hydrophilic, and vice versa. these differences could be due to mrna editing, sequencing error of either the genomic dna or ests, or polymorphisms between the samples used for genomic and est sequences .

asequence analyzed coordinates based on the gene sequence, considering the first base of the initiation codon as bp  <dig>  bvariation type:  – . cvariable position is given in reference to the first base of the initiation codon of the gene sequence.

phylogenetic analysis
we examined two datasets that differed by a single rosid taxon to assess the effect of taxon sampling on resolving relationships among rosids. the first data matrix examined for phylogenetic analyses included  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> taxa , including  <dig> angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups , and the second data matrix included  <dig> taxa with the addition of gossypium. both data sets comprised  <dig>  nucleotide positions but when the gaps were excluded there were  <dig>  characters.

maximum parsimony  analyses of the 28-taxon dataset resulted in a single, fully resolved tree with a length of  <dig> , a consistency index of  <dig>   and a retention index of  <dig>  . bootstrap analyses indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes were supported by values ≥ 95% and all but one of these had a bootstrap value of 100%. maximum likelihood  analysis resulted in a single tree with – lnl =  <dig> . ml bootstrap values also were consistently high, with values of ≥ 95% for  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes. the ml and mp trees had very similar topologies, except for two important differences. the first concerned the position of the two basal angiosperm lineages. the mp tree placed amborella as the most basal lineage followed by the nymphaeales , whereas the ml tree placed amborella sister to the nymphaeales, and together this group formed the basal lineage of angiosperms. the second topological difference concerned the placement of calycanthus, the only representative of the magnolids. the mp tree placed calycanthus sister to the eudicots, whereas the ml tree positioned calycanthus as sister to a large clade that included both monocots and eudicots. support for the different placements of calycanthus was weak in both mp and ml analyses, whereas the support for the different resolutions of basal angiosperms was stronger . these two differences were also detected in a recent phylogeny of basal angiosperms based on whole chloroplast genome sequences  <cit> . the remaining angiosperms formed two major clades, one including monocots and a second including the eudicots . monophyly of the monocots was strongly supported  and included members of three different orders . ranunculales were the earliest diverging lineage of eudicots. there were two major clades of core eudicots, one including the rosids and the second including the caryophyllales + asterids. within the rosids, vitis was sister to the remaining taxa, which formed two clades, one including cucumis  + myrtales, and a second with arabidopsis  + fabales. overall, relationships within rosids were in agreement with recent phylogenies  except that the eurosids i clade was paraphyletic in our analyses.

mp analysis of the second dataset of  <dig> taxa including gossypium resulted in a single most parsimonious tree with a length of  <dig> , a consistency index of  <dig>   and a retention index of  <dig>  . bootstrap analyses indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes were supported by values ≥ 95%, and all but four of these nodes had a bootstrap value of 100%. ml analysis resulted in a tree with a – lnl =  <dig>  . ml bootstrap analyses indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes were supported by values ≥ 95% and all but two of these nodes had a bootstrap value of 100%. both mp and ml analyses provided strong support for vitis as the earliest diverging lineage of rosids, monophyly of myrtales, and sister relationship of brassicales and malvales. the ml and mp trees had three important topological differences. the first two differences concerned the position of calycanthus and the basal angiosperms, which were identical to those described above for the analyses that excluded gossypium. the other difference concerned relationships among rosids. the mp tree  showed strong support  for monophyly of the eurosid i clade because of the sister relationship between the fabales and cucurbitales. in contrast, the ml tree indicated that eurosids i are paraphyletic because cucurbitales were sister to mrytales rather than fabales ; bootstrap support for this relationship was also strong .

discussion
grapes are an important crop plant grown for wine, juice, raisins, and as fresh fruit. in  <dig>  the world's grape harvest area in  <dig> grape-producing countries was  <dig>  million hectares, and in the united states grapes were grown in  <dig>  hectares  <cit> . the total production of grapes in the us in  <dig> was  <dig> , <dig> metric tons and this generated $ <dig>  billion  <cit> . there is considerable interest in using chloroplast genetic engineering as an environmentally friendly approach for engineering disease resistance to powdery and downy mildew, two fungal diseases that have a negative impact on the grape industry. chloroplast genetic engineering offers a number of unique advantages, including a high-level of transgene expression  <cit> , multi-gene engineering in a single transformation event  <cit> , transgene containment via maternal inheritance  <cit>  or cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> , and lack of gene silencing, position effect, pleiotropic effects, and undesirable foreign dna  <cit> . thus far, transgenes have been stably integrated and expressed via the chloroplast genome to confer several useful agronomic traits, including insect resistance  <cit> , herbicide resistance  <cit> , disease resistance  <cit> , drought tolerance  <cit> , salt tolerance  <cit> , and phytoremediation  <cit> . the complete grape chloroplast genome sequence reported in this paper provides valuable characterization of spacer regions for potential integration of transgenes at optimal sites via homologous recombination, as well as endogenous regulatory sequences for optimal expression of transgenes.

genome organization and evolution
the organization of the vitis genome with two copies of an ir separating the ssc and lsc regions is identical to most sequenced angiosperm chloroplast genomes . the size of the genome at  <dig>  bp is also within the known size range for angiosperms, which generally vary from  <dig>   to  <dig>  bp  among photosynthetic genomes from dicots that have both copies of the ir. size of the vitis ir at  <dig>  bp is also well within the size range of other sequenced dicot genomes, which range from  <dig>   to  <dig>  bp . gene content and order of the vitis chloroplast genome is virtually identical to tobacco and many other unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes. several previously sequenced rosid chloroplast genomes have lost the rpl <dig> gene, including legumes  <cit> . the distribution of this loss on the chloroplast phylogeny  indicates that there have been at least two independent losses of rpl <dig> in rosids. multiple, independent gene losses in angiosperms have been demonstrated for other genes including infa  <cit> , rps <dig>  <cit>  and accd  <cit> . thus, it is evident that gene losses are not always reliable indicators of phylogenetic relationships.

it is increasingly evident that chloroplast genomes contain repeated sequences other than the ir  <cit> . several studies have identified a higher incidence of dispersed repeats in genomes that have experienced extensive rearrangements  <cit> . however, dispersed repeats are also being detected in unrearranged genomes. in most cases, these repeats are more common in intergenic spacers and introns, which is also true for the vitis genome. repeats have been located in a number of other rosids  <cit>  in the same regions as those identified in the vitis genome. one of these, a  <dig> bp repeat in the trns gene, is in the same location in gossypium hirsutum  <cit> , indicating that this repeat may be shared among rosids. although repeats have been implicated in playing a role in chloroplast genome rearrangements  <cit> , their effect if any in unrearranged chloroplast genomes is unknown.

based on previous studies of atropa  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> , posttranscriptional rna editing events, as well as deamination-facilitating attacks on nucleotides' exocyclic amino groups, yield primarily c-to-u alterations. analyses of the vitis chloroplast genome and the corresponding ests indicate that the five c-to-u changes likely represent mrna edits. however, the remaining six differences could be either sequencing errors in the genomic dna or est sequences or due to the use of different cultivars and/or plants/tissues used for sequencing. our methods eliminate the latter explanation since we only compared dna and est sequences from leaves of the chardonnay variety of vitis vinifera. in view of the high depth of coverage  of our genomic dna sequences, we believe that the non c-to-u changes represent est sequencing errors.

evolutionary loss of rna editing sites has been observed in earlier studies and could be attributed to a decrease in the effect of rna-editing enzymes  <cit> . additionally, conversions other than c-to-u in vitis and other plants suggest that chloroplast genomes may be accumulating a considerable number of nucleotide substitutions, and some genes might accumulate more changes than others, such as the petl and ndh genes that have a high frequency of rna editing  <cit> . therefore, despite high levels sequence conservation in chloroplast genomes, variations do occur posttranscriptionally, promoting translational efficiency due to transcript-protein complex binding and/or changes in the chloroplasts microenvironment .

phylogenetic implications
phylogenetic analyses of  <dig>  or  <dig>  angiosperms based on  <dig> protein-coding genes identified many of the major lineages recognized in previous phylogenetic hypotheses of flowering plants . two groups, amborella and nymphaelaes  are basal, with amborella forming the first diverging lineage in mp analyses and amborella/nymphaelaes together forming the most basal clade in ml trees. these results are congruent with recent 61-gene analyses by leebens-mack et al.  <cit>  and support their contention that limited taxon sampling in earlier whole chloroplast genome phylogenies led some previous workers to suggest that amborella may not be among the earliest diverging angiosperm lineages  <cit> . monophyly of the monocots is strongly supported, and they are sister to the remaining angiosperms. calycanthus, the sole representative of the magnolids, is weakly supported as sister to eudicots in the mp analyses  but the genus is weakly supported as sister to a clade that includes both monocots and eudicots in ml trees . monophyly of eudicots is strongly supported , in agreement with phylogenies based on both pollen  <cit>  and other molecular data  <cit> . within eudicots, ranunculales diverge first and are sister to a strongly supported eudicot clade that includes two moderately to well-supported groups comprising the rosids and asterids. the early divergence of ranunculales among eudicots is in agreement with many recent molecular phylogenies . although previous studies have clearly indicated that carylophyllales belong in the core eudicot clade  <cit> , resolution of the relationships of caryophyllales to other major clades of eudicots remains uncertain. this order has been considered to be closely allied to rosids, asterids, or simply as an unresolved major eudicot clade sister to the dilleniaceae  <cit> . although taxon sampling is limited in our  <dig> gene phylogeny, there is moderate to strong support for a sister relationship between the caryophyllales and asterids .

the rosid clade is very diverse, including nearly  <dig> families representing approximately 39% of the species of angiosperms. the most recent phylogenies of this group  indicate that there are seven major clades whose relationships still remain unresolved. eight  or nine  representatives of four of these major clades are included in our phylogenetic analyses, including members of eurosids i, eurosids ii, myrtales, and vitaceae. phylogenetic analyses of both datasets using mp and ml clearly indicate that the vitaceae is sister to the remaining rosids, and therefore represents an early diverging member of the rosid clade. previous molecular phylogenetic comparisons that included vitaceae could not resolve its relationship. phylogenetic analyses of rbcl sequences alone placed the vitaceae as sister to either the caryophyllales or asterid clade with weak support  <cit> . phylogenies based on atpb provided only weak support for a sister relationship of vitaceae to saxifragales  <cit> . several phylogenies based on two to four genes suggested that the vitaceae are sister to rest of the rosids, with relatively weak support . however, phylogenies based on the chloroplast gene matk did not place vitaceae sister to rosids but instead positioned the family as sister to dilleniaceae with weak support  <cit> . in short, the phylogenetic position of vitaceae is equivocal, though our results strongly support the earlier findings that vitaceae represent an early diverging clade within rosids .

the two datasets we examined differed by only one taxon but the results of mp analyses differed dramatically regarding the placement of three of the four rosid clades examined . the 28-taxon dataset  showed relationships that are incongruent with recent molecular phylogenies of rosids  <cit>  by placing the eurosids ii  sister to the fabales in eurosids i. this made eurosids i paraphyletic because the other representative of this clade is cucumis , which is sister to the brassicales in molecular phylogenies of rosids  <cit> . the addition of gossypium in the 29-taxon dataset generates mp trees  that are congruent with previous angiosperm phylogenies. the brassicales and malvales are sister and there is strong support for the monophyly of eurosid ii. the addition of gossypium also makes the eurosid i clade strongly monophyletic in the mp tree by placing the cucurbitales sister to the fabales, both of which are members of the nitrogen-fixing clade . in contrast to the mp trees, relationships among the major rosid clades do not differ in the ml trees when gossypium is added. in both the  <dig> and 29-taxon data sets the ml trees do not support the monophyly of eurosids i since cucurbitales  are sister to the myrtales and brassicales  are sister to the fabales . therefore, the ml analyses are incongruent with currently accepted relationships among rosids  <cit> , though the strongest support for the monophyly of eurosid i clade is only 77%  in a three-gene analysis  <cit> . thus, our results suggest that additional phylogenetic studies are needed to assess the monophyly of eurosids i and their relationship to other rosids.

there has been considerable debate regarding the utility of whole genome sequences for phylogeny reconstruction  <cit> . some have argued that the use of more genes from whole genomes has great potential for providing much more data for resolving phylogenetic relationships  <cit> , whereas others have suggested that problems with limited taxon sampling available for whole genomes  <cit>  and model misspecification  <cit>  overshadows any potential advantages. one example that highlighted each of these concerns centered around the controversy regarding identification of basal angiosperms. leebens-mack et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that inadequate taxon sampling clearly played a role in misleading some previous studies, and goremykin et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ml analyses of whole chloroplast genome data sets can be sensitive to model specification. it is well known that ml methods fail when model parameters are misspecified  <cit> . the phylogenetic analyses in this study provide yet another example of these phenomena. addition of the gossypium genome to our parsimony analyses generated trees that are congruent with current understanding of relationships among the major rosid clades. however, the ml analyses are incongruent with the mp trees regarding the monophyly and relationships of the rosid clades and support for the alternative relationships was very strong in each case . it is possible, if not likely, that the use of a single "average" model  in the ml analyses is inappropriate for a data set of  <dig> concatenated genes . future phylogenetic analyses of complete chloroplast genome sequences should consider using methods in which different models can be applied to different partitions of the data   <cit> . development of more appropriate models of evolution of chloroplast sequences  <cit>  may also improve the accuracy of phylogenies based on these genomes. thus, we need more extensive sampling of whole chloroplast genomes from the major lineages of flowering plants and more rigorous phylogenetic analyses before the full potential of this approach can be realized. ongoing projects by several labs  should greatly enhance our taxon sampling so that we can generate reliable phylogenies based on whole chloroplast genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the chloroplast genome of vitis has a very similar size and organization to other previously sequenced, unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes. these sequences will provide a valuable resource for developing transgenes for this important crop plant using the more environmentally friendly chloroplast genetic engineering technology  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of a dataset of sequences of  <dig> shared protein-coding genes of vitis and  <dig> other angiosperm genomes demonstrated the importance of taxon sampling and methods of phylogenetic analysis for phylogenomic studies. furthermore, trees generated by both parsimony and likelihood methods provided support for the resolution of relationships among eudicots. this included support for the position of the ranunculales as the earliest diverging lineage of eudicots, the placement of the caryophyllales as the sister clade to the asterids, and the position of the vitaceae sister to all other rosids. however, resolution of relationships among the remaining rosid clades based on complete chloroplast genome sequences remains unresolved due to limited taxon sampling and differences in trees generated by mp and ml analyses.
