BACKGROUND
leptin is a cytokine which is secreted predominantly by white adipose tissue and exerts its effects on appetite and thermogenesis on centers located in the hypothalamus  <cit> . in addition to these well defined central actions, it has become clear that leptin also has important peripheral effects, including the regulation of the immune system and the modulation of insulin secretion from the pancreas  <cit> . the requirement of leptin for a normal immune response has been characterised in detail in various animal models of autoimmune diseases and experimentally induced inflammation  <cit> . this proinflammatory effect of leptin is at least partially mediated by its direct action on t-lymphocytes, although macrophages and natural killer  cells also appear to be responsive to leptin  <cit> .

two main signalling pathways have been proposed to mediate the inhibitory effect of leptin on insulin secretion. firstly, leptin causes the pi- <dig> kinase-dependent activation of phosphodiesterase 3b  and subsequent reduction of intracellular camp levels  <cit> . secondly, leptin activates atp-sensitive k+ channels on β-cells and thereby antagonises depolarisation required for insulin secretion  <cit> . these are both unusual pathways, considering that the leptin receptor  belongs to the class i cytokine receptor family and transmits signals mainly via the jak/stat  pathway  <cit> . lepr exists in several splicing variants, the longest one  being the only one capable of activating jak/stat signalling  <cit> . the effect of leptin on β-cells clearly depends on the presence of the long splicing variant of the leptin receptor , because leptin does not inhibit insulin secretion from islets isolated from db/db mice which harbour a splice site mutation that specifically affects expression of leprb  <cit> . ligand binding to leprb results in trans-autophosphorylation and thereby activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase jak <dig> and subsequent recruitment and activation of stat factors to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic part of leprb  <cit> . in rat islet cells and in rodent insulinoma cell lines , leptin has been shown to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig> and dual phosphorylation of the map kinases erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . we have recently shown that each of the three conserved tyrosine residues in murine leprb exhibits different signalling capacities in the insulinoma cell line hit-t <dig>  <cit> . tyr <dig> mediated leptin-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases  <dig> and  <dig> , tyr <dig> induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of stat <dig>  and tyr <dig> was capable of activating stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig>  although stat factors are well known to regulate transcription, the range of transcriptional targets responsive to leptin stimulation of pancreatic β-cells is not well characterised  <cit> .

in the present study we used rat rinm5f insulinoma cells as a model system to study the changes in gene expression that leptin elicits in β-cells and to characterise the signalling pathway by which the transciptional effects of leptin are mediated. in particular, we show that several inflammation-related genes were upregulated by leptin. notably, some of these mrnas were also induced by il-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine thought to play a major role in β-cell destruction in type  <dig> diabetes mellitus. these data provide the first characterisation of leptin's effects on gene expression in a non-neuronal cell type.

RESULTS
identification of leptin-induced genes in rinm5f cells
we have previously employed rinm5f cells ectopically expressing leprb to characterise leptin signal transduction in an insulin-producing cell line  <cit> . in order to identify genes regulated by leptin in pancreatic β-cells, we compared gene expression in leptin-stimulated and non-stimulated rinm5f cells by differential hybridisation of high-density filter arrays containing  <dig>  non-redundant rat cdnas. from  <dig> transcripts that showed a strong differential signal after  <dig> h of leptin treatment, we selected  <dig> for further expression analysis by northern blot hybridisation. table  <dig> lists  <dig> transcripts that were confirmed to be upregulated by leptin. five transcripts were identified as false positives .

in this study we focus on those genes potentially related to inflammatory processes. four transcripts encode secreted acute phase proteins: fibrinogen-β, tissue-type plasminogen activator , pancreatitis-associated protein , and lipocalin- <dig>  <cit> . preprotachykinin- <dig> is the precursor of substance p, a mediator of neurogenic inflammation  <cit> . in addition, the mitochondrial enzyme manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase  has also been classified as an "acute phase protein" because it is upregulated in many inflammatory conditions  <cit> .

costimulatory effects of il-1β and leptin
considering that interleukin-1β  is an important inflammatory mediator in pancreatic β-cells, we asked whether leptin and il-1β had overlapping effects on the expression of inflammation-related genes. therefore, rinm5f cells were stimulated with il-1β, leptin, or a combination of leptin and il-1β for different time periods, and mrna levels of specific transcripts were analysed by northern blotting . as controls, we used probes for inos, which is known to be induced by il-1β, and ribosomal protein l <dig>  as a loading control.

according to the different time courses of leptin-induced upregulation, northern blot analysis allowed us to distinguish immediate early , delayed early  and late target genes , which had their expression maxima at 1– <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of leptin stimulation, respectively. concerning the effect of il-1β, mrna levels for fibrinogen-β, tpa, lipocalin <dig>  mnsod and ppap2a were found to be upregulated by il-1β alone. among them, lipocalin <dig> and mnsod were more strongly induced by il1β than by leptin. as expected, inos mrna was induced by il-1β but not by leptin. costimulation with il1β and leptin revealed synergistic effects of both cytokines on the expression of fibrinogen-β, lipocalin- <dig> and mnsod, i.e. the effect of costimulation exceeded the added effects of each cytokine.

comparison of leptin and ifnγ
it is well known that il-1β and ifnγ synergistically regulate inflammation-related genes in pancreatic β-cells  <cit> . since both leptin and ifnγ modulate gene expression by activating the jak/stat pathway, we compared the effects of these cytokines on the activation of stat factors in the rinm5f cell line. as we have previously reported  <cit> , leptin induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of both stat <dig> and stat <dig> . in contrast, ifnγ rather selectively activated stat <dig>  although in this direct comparison ifnγ elicited a stronger tyrosyl phosphorylation of stat <dig>  this result hints to the possibility that both cytokines have partially overlapping effects on gene expression in rinm5f cells.

next we analysed the effects of leptin and ifnγ on the expression of the inflammation-related transcripts identified in the present study. rinm5f cells were stimulated with leptin or ifnγ either alone or in combination with il-1β, and transcript levels were determined by northern blot hybridisation. a probe for ifnγ-regulated factor  <dig>  was included as a positive control for the action of ifnγ. as shown in figure  <dig>  ifnγ alone did not upregulate the transcripts that were induced by leptin. on the other hand, irf <dig> mrna levels were not affected by leptin. these results show that leptin and ifnγ differentially regulate the expression of inflammation-related genes in rinm5f insulinoma cells, probably because the cytokines act via different stat factors. interestingly, similar to leptin, ifnγ enhanced the il-1β-induced upregulation of the mrnas for tpa, lipocalin- <dig> and mnsod.

requirement of tyr- <dig> in leprb for induction of inflammation-related genes
next, we asked which signalling pathway might be involved in the induction of the inflammation-related genes by leptin. to determine the role of the three intracellular tyrosine residues  in leprb-mediated activation of gene expression, we generated rinm5f cell lines that stably express leprb point mutants in which phenylalanines replace two of the three tyrosines, or the triple mutant. leptin binding assays verified that all leprb constructs were expressed at the cell surface and differed by less than  <dig> -fold in leptin binding .

to characterise the signalling potential of these cells, we analyzed the leptin-induced phosphorylation of stat factors and of erk1/ <dig> by western blotting with activation state-specific antibodies . the results show that the full activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> required the presence of tyr <dig>  whereas the phosphorylation of stat <dig> was mediated equally well by tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  the major part of erk phosphorylation was dependent on the membrane-proximal tyrosine residue . these findings are in agreement with results that we have previously obtained in transiently transfected hit-t <dig> insulinoma cells  <cit> . intriguingly, a residual phosphorylation of stat factors and of erk1/ <dig> was detectable even when all intracellular leprb tyrosine residues had been exchanged for phenylalanine. this cannot be explained by the action of endogenous leprb since neither the parental rinm5f cells nor control cells that were infected with the empty vector showed detectable effects of leptin .

these cell lines were now used to study the capacity of the leprb point mutants to upregulate mrna levels of the leptin target genes identified in this work. as shown in figure  <dig>  induction by leptin depended on the presence of tyr <dig>  suggesting that the transcription of these genes is regulated by stat <dig> and/or stat <dig>  consistent with the tyrosine-independent activation of stat <dig> detected by western blotting , weak leptin effects were also observed in the cell lines expressing leprb-yff or leprb-fyf. however, the degree of induction by these constructs did not exceed that of the triple mutant . interestingly, transcript levels were always higher in cells expressing leprb-ffy compared to wild type leprb, consistent with a role for tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> in the negative regulation of leptin signalling  <cit> .

leptin controls preprotachykinin- <dig> and lipocalin- <dig> gene expression at the level of promoter regulation
to substantiate the hypothesis that leptin controls the expression of inflammation-related genes by way of transcriptional regulation, we decided to determine the effect of leptin on promoter activity. we selected two rat genes whose promoters had not previously been analysed for regulation by stat factors, lcn <dig>  and tac <dig> . as in our previous studies  <cit> , we used hit-t <dig> hamster insulinoma cells for the promoter assays because rinm5f cells were only poorly transfected in transient assays. the results of the luciferase assays are presented in figure  <dig> and show clearly that both the lcn <dig> and the tac <dig> promoter are regulated by leptin. consistent with the northern blot results, promoter induction depended on the presence of tyr <dig> in leprb, supporting the hypothesis that stat <dig> and/or stat <dig> are involved. also in agreement with the northern blot data, lcn <dig> promoter activity was very low in the absence of leptin and was strongly induced by leptin, whereas the tac <dig> promoter showed considerable basal activity in the absence of a stimulus. these data indicate that leptin upregulates expression of lipocalin- <dig> and preprotachykinin- <dig> by control of transcription.

to address the question whether the regulation of these promoters by leptin was a specific feature of insulinoma cells, we took advantage of a leprb-expressing pc- <dig> pheochromocytoma cell line that was established in a previous study  <cit> . in this cell line, the effect of leptin on target gene promoters was found to be enhanced by simultaneous treatment with forskolin. forskolin is a nonspecific activator of adenylate cyclases and enhances intracellular levels of camp. similar to the results obtained in hit-t <dig> cells transfected with wild type leprb, leptin induced both the tac <dig> and the lcn <dig> promoter in the pc- <dig> cell line . the weaker effect of leptin as compared to the hit-t <dig> cells is likely due to the fact that the pc- <dig> cells were not kept serum-free during treatment with leptin and/or forskolin, in order to avoid differentiation of the cells. treatment with forskolin further enhanced the effect of leptin on both promoters, as previously observed for other leptin-regulated promoters in this cell line .

leptin increases caspase-like proteolytic activity in rinm5f cells
to assess a possible cytotoxic effect of leptin on insulin-producing cells, we determined the effect of leptin treatment on the enzymatic activity of caspase  <dig>  as a key player in apoptosis induction. exposure of rinm5f-leprb cells to leptin led to caspase  <dig> activation in a dose-dependent manner . co-administration of leptin with il-1β revealed an additive effect of the cytokines. leptin did not alter caspase activity in untransfected rinm5f cells , indicating that the effect depended on the presence of leprb. as a positive control, the cells were also exposed to a mix of il-1β and ifnγ which is known to be proapoptotic for rinm5f cells  <cit> . in this direct comparison, the combination of il-1β  and ifnγ  resulted in a stronger induction of caspase activity than il-1β  plus leptin .

discussion
to gain insight into the gene regulatory effects of leptin that may contribute to its action on body weight regulation, screens for the identification of leptin-regulated genes have previously been performed in neuronal cell lines overexpressing leprb  <cit> . here we have used the insulin-producing cell line rinm5f as a model system to characterise the transcriptional effects of leptin in pancreatic β-cells, one of the peripheral target cells of leptin. a striking result of this screen is that leptin induces the expression of several genes related to inflammatory conditions, including genes encoding acute phase response proteins , preprotachykinin and mnsod. moreover, some of these leptin-induced transcripts were also induced by il-1β, which is considered to be the most cytotoxic cytokine for β-cells  <cit> . these results reflect the molecular nature of leptin as a cytokine and are consistent with the hypothesis that high levels of leptin may play a role in the low-grade inflammatory state associated with obesity  <cit> .

what might be the role of these inflammation-related proteins in pancreatic islets? of the genes listed in table  <dig>  only sod <dig>  has been functionally studied in insulin-producing cells. sod <dig> is strongly induced in many cells, including rinm5f, by il-1β via binding of nfκb to specific promoter elements  <cit> . oxygen free radicals are generated in cytokine-stimulated β-cells, and overexpression of mnsod, which inactivates mitochondrially derived oxygen free radicals, can prevent cytokine-induced apoptosis of β-cells  <cit> . thus, upregulation of mnsod by leptin is likely to have a protective effect on β-cells.

the role of the secreted acute phase proteins in β-cell inflammation has not yet been directly addressed. the product of the pap gene  has been designated "pancreatitis-associated protein"  because of its increased expression in rat pancreatic acinar cells in acute pancreatitis  <cit> . pap <dig> belongs to a family of small secretory proteins that are related to reg <dig>  the gene name reg <dig> refers to regenerating pancreatic islets following partial pancreatectomy, where transcripts of reg <dig> are significantly induced  <cit> . the reg <dig> protein is thought to act on pancreatic β-cells as an autocrine and/or paracrine factor and has been demonstrated to induce proliferation of β-cells and thereby to ameliorate the diabetes of 90% depancreatised rats and mice  <cit> . it is not known whether other members of the reg family share this ability, but pap <dig> has been shown to act as an auto/paracrine neurotrophic factor on motoneurons  <cit> . furthermore, pap <dig> has anti-inflammatory effects in pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> , suggesting that it may also protect β-cells in islet inflammation. interestingly, the pap gene was found to be overexpressed in islets from a patient with recent-onset type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> , indicating that its upregulation in islet inflammation is not restricted to rodents.

lipocalin- <dig>  has been identified as a very highly regulated transcript in many inflammatory conditions  <cit> . lipocalin- <dig> sequesters bacterial siderophores and is a bacteriostatic agent contributing to the innate immune response  <cit> . furthermore, the iron-free lipocalin- <dig> apoprotein can induce apoptosis of several cell types, including leukocytes, whereas iron-containing holo lipocalin- <dig> can prevent apoptosis  <cit> . the effect of lipocalin- <dig> on pancreatic β-cells has not yet been studied.

fibrinogen-β and tpa are classical acute phase plasma proteins that are predominately expressed in the liver  <cit> . it is unlikely that the enhanced expression of these proteins in pancreatic islets contributes significantly to their blood level, but local effects on fibrogenesis or fibrolysis may occur in insulitis. similarly, the physiological significance of preprotachykinin expression is not clear. preprotachykinin- <dig> is the precursor of substance p, a mediator of neurogenic inflammation in inflammatory diseases of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems  <cit> . rinm5f cells have previously been described to express tac <dig> and to secrete substance p  <cit> . interestingly, substance p has recently been implicated in the autoimmune diabetes of the nod mouse model, because expression of the receptor for substance p  was upregulated in the islets during development of insulitis  <cit> . however, preprotachykinin has been reported to be expressed in rat pancreatic islets only transiently during development, and the expression in rinm5f cells may reflect embryonal characteristics of this cell line  <cit> .

in this study, we took advantage of the rinm5f insulinoma cell line as a model for pancreatic β-cells because cultured clonal cells provide a homogenous, well defined experimental system for array experiments. rinm5f cells have frequently been used to characterise the effect of cytokines on insulin-producing cells . we have recently shown that rinm5f cells expressing the long splicing variant of the leptin receptor  display the full range of leptin effects relevant for transcriptional regulation   <cit> . expression of pap, lcn <dig>  and sod <dig>  was found to be increased in a mouse model of autoimmune diabetes  <cit> . transcripts for tpa, fibrinogen-β and mnsod were induced by il-1β in isolated rat βcells  <cit> . taken together, these results show that in rinm5f cells leptin induces a set of genes that is also expressed in β-cells in models of diabetes and β-cell destruction.

to sum up, the set of leptin-induced transcripts characterised here includes both mrnas for protective  as well as potentially cytotoxic proteins . other well-characterised proinflammatory cytokines, such as the combination of il-1β and ifnγ, are also known to induce defence-related genes  <cit> . leptin did not induce the same genes as ifnγ, but both cytokines had the same costimulatory effect on certain il-1β-induced transcripts . after all, leptin induced caspase activation in rinm5f cells, strongly suggestive of a pro-apoptotic effect of leptin. notably, the leptin concentration applied  is within the range of blood levels observed in obese humans  <cit> . however, more work is needed to establish whether the high levels of leptin in obesity have a protective effect or contribute to islet destruction in vivo.

finally, we have employed leprb tyrosine/phenylalanine point mutants to provide an initial characterisation of the signalling pathway responsible for leptin's effect on gene expression in insulin-producing cells. for all genes under investigation, the induction by leptin was dependent on the presence of tyr <dig> which is embedded in a canonical box <dig> motif . this result suggests that the effect of leptin requires the activation of stat <dig> and/or stat <dig>  some of the genes have previously been shown to be regulated by cytokines that activate stat <dig>  including mnsod, fibrinogen-β, tpa and pap <dig>  we have previously identified pap as a leptin-induced gene in rat pc <dig> pheochromocytoma cells, and have defined a stat3-responsive promoter element  <cit> . lcn <dig> is also known to be induced by cytokines that transmit their signal via activation of the jak/stat pathway . our data show that induction of lcn <dig> by leptin depends on the presence of the tyr <dig> in leprb, suggesting that activation of stat <dig> and/or stat <dig> is required. however, the rat lcn <dig> promoter contains no consensus stat-binding element within the sequence tested in the reporter gene assay . similarly, no recognisable stat3-binding site is present in the rat tac <dig> promoter. considering the delayed response of both the lipocalin- <dig> and preprotachykinin- <dig> mrna to leptin, it appears likely that regulation of these genes occurs by an indirect mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
the main result of our study is that leptin induces the expression of inflammation-related genes in rinm5f insulinoma cells, of which only pap was already known as a leptin target gene. several of these genes have also been described to be upregulated in animal models of diabetes , suggesting that this pattern of changes in gene expression reflects an inflammatory response of β-cells. the transcriptional effects of leptin required a functional box <dig> motif of the leptin receptor and are likely mediated via stat <dig>  intriguingly, the effect of leptin on gene expression overlaps partially with that of il-1β, a cytokine acting via a completely different signalling pathway, but not with that of ifnγ, which activates stat <dig>  the observation that leptin synergises with il-1β in caspase  <dig> induction is consistent with the proposed function of leptin as a modulator of immune and inflammatory responses.
