BACKGROUND
a very important source of vegetable oil worldwide, brassica napus has extremely high oil production efficiency  <cit> , and pol cytoplasm has been widely used in most of cultivated breeds  <cit> . cytoplasmic male sterility  prevents self-pollination through pollen abortion, enabling the use of heterosis in hybrid crops for genetic improvement  <cit> . the sterility mechanism of pol has been examined in many studies, in which the orf224/atp <dig> and rfp genes have mainly been analyzed. results have shown that the sterility is caused by chimeric mitochondrial genes regulated by nuclear genes  <cit> .

in recent years, high-throughput sequencing methods such as illumina solexa, abi solid and roche  <dig> have observably increased the efficiency and reduced the cost of sequencing, making the study of transcriptomes and even genome levels easier and more feasible  <cit> . nowadays, the transcriptomes of many higher plants have been sequenced for different purposes, including arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , myrica rubra <cit> , fagopyrum <cit> , citrus sinensis <cit> , carthamus tinctorius <cit> , and even brassica napus for fertility studies  <cit> . by rna-seq, researchers can obtain almost all of the expressed genes, especially genes with very low abundance. therefore, genes with abundant expression differences and interesting pathways can be analyzed exhaustively  <cit> . additionally, rna-seq also has great advantages in the identification of new genes and snps, and even in genome-wide association studies   <cit> . in polyploid plants, it is used to study the fate of duplicated genes as well, such as in soybean and bread wheat  <cit> .

in this work, fertile and sterile flower buds of pol cms with a length of 0–1 mm were sequenced using the illumina high-throughput sequencing platform, representing the first study of the pol cms genome at the transcriptome level. the aim of this work was to identify the differences between the fertile and sterile buds at the transcriptional level, and find out the different bioprocesses involved and their related functions. these results will help the elucidation of the sterility molecular mechanism, and assist the breeding of b. napus.

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization of fertile and sterile floral buds
sterile flowers were visually smaller than fertile flowers. in the developmental process, the anthers and filaments of the sterile flowers were always shorter than those of the fertile flowers. in addition, the sterile anthers produced little or no pollen, but the pistil was normal . to accurately determine the stage and tissue in which sterility occurs, fertile and sterile anthers were cytologically observed in different development stages. as shown in figure  <dig>  there was no clear difference between them until stage  <dig> of anther development. in stage  <dig>  the sterile anthers did not differentiate sporogenous cells; additionally, the middle layer, endothecium and tapetum could not be distinguished . after that, the sterile anthers were filled with numerous highly vacuolated cells. they also showed cavities in later stages . in sterile anthers, locules with pollen sacs in stage  <dig> were very few and did not produce normal tetrads. in contrast, the fertile anthers developed normally in all stages.

transcriptome sequencing and assembly
after the raw data were trimmed,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads for fertile samples and  <dig> , <dig> for sterile samples were obtained . all clean reads  were assembled by running trinity, as no reference genome was available for b. napus <cit> . as a result,  <dig>  contigs  were generated with an average length of 621 bp and a n <dig> of 927 bp. after clustering,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained, including  <dig>  clusters and  <dig>  singletons. the average length of these unigenes was 638 bp and the n <dig> was 982 bp. there were  <dig>  unigenes  with a length range from  <dig> to 500 bp,  <dig>  unigenes  longer than  <dig>  bp and no unigenes shorter than 200 bp . the singletons mentioned above refer to contigs that matched no other contig, and the clusters and singletons generated from the contigs covered all of the obtained unigenes  <cit> .

functional annotation
for annotation, the  <dig>  unigenes were subjected to blastx searches against the sequences in the nr , swiss-prot and cog databases . as a result,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes were aligned against the three protein databases, respectively. among these unigenes,  <dig>   were annotated by all three databases and  <dig>   were annotated by at least one database .

there were  <dig>  unigenes annotated by both the nr and cog databases. to examine the distribution of the assembly results, these unigenes were categorized into at least  <dig> cog  function clusters. among the  <dig> clusters, the “general function prediction only” cluster comprised the highest number of unigenes , and the “replication, recombination and repair” cluster had the second largest number of unigenes. in contrast, only  <dig> unigenes were classified into “nuclear structure” . go  classifications were also obtained to investigate the functions of the unigenes;  <dig>   unigenes that were annotated by both the nr and swiss-prot databases were classified into  <dig> groups. among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  were assigned  <dig>  go annotations. all  <dig> groups can be categorized into three main classifications: “cellular component”, “molecular function” and “biological process”. there were  <dig>   unigenes in the “cell part”,  <dig>   in the “binding” and  <dig>   in the “cellular process” categories, which were the major categories in each of the three main classifications motioned above, respectively. in addition, “organelle”, “catalytic activity” and “metabolic process” also had large proportions  of unigenes. conversely, some groups such as “metallochaperone activity”, “cell killing”, “proteasome regulator activity” and “auxiliary transport protein activity” had small numbers of unigenes .

putative genes related with pollen development
the development of pollen is a fundamental and complex process in flowering plants. it is essential for propagation and evolution. as a model plant, arabidopsis thaliana has been well studied for this bioprocess. therefore, all of the unigenes identified here were annotated to the tair database . subsequently, unigenes annotated to  <dig> genes from ag to ms <dig>  which are considered to regulate pollen development and act before meiosis, were extracted for analysis  <cit> . the results showed that among the  <dig> genes, some were significantly down-regulated in sterile buds, such as bnnzz/spl, bnspl <dig>  bnexs/ems <dig> and bner, but no gene was dramatically up-regulated . additionally, most of these genes did not show significant differences in expression between the fertile and sterile buds.

transcripts differentially expressed in fertile and sterile buds
the fpkm  value was calculated to test the expression levels of the unigenes. we noticed that in some basic bioprocesses these unigenes showed high expression levels in both the fertile and sterile buds. for example, unigene <dig> and unigene <dig>  which were involved in rna transport, showed very high expression in both fertile buds  and sterile buds . additionally, some unigenes related to metabolism, such as unigene <dig> , showed high abundance as well.

with the restrictive conditions of log <dig> ratio >  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig> , a total of  <dig>   unigenes that were significantly differentially expressed were obtained, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes in sterile buds . the up- and down-regulated unigenes were submitted to kaas  and classified with the sbh  method  <cit> . most of the up-regulated unigenes were included in metabolic pathways . in contrast, a relatively large number of the down-regulated unigenes functioned in transcription and translation besides metabolic pathways , such as the unigenes related with spliceosomes, rna transport and ribosome biogenesis. specifically, we found that there were seven callose synthase  genes in the down-regulated unigenes. this result was consistent with the observation of anther semi-thin sections.

in addition, go analysis was performed using blast2go  <cit> . after enrichment analysis, only  <dig> go terms showed significant differences. among these terms, four  were associated with the up-regulated unigenes and five  were associated with down-regulated unigenes . in the molecular function category, only oxidoreductase and hydrolase activities were different between the up- and down-regulated unigenes .

in particular, orf <dig>  which is believed to be a key orf of pol cms in the mitochondrial genome  <cit> , showed a 4-fold transcript increase in sterile buds compared with fertile buds. atp <dig>  a chimeric gene of orf <dig>  also showed minor up-regulation.

qrt-pcr verification
the differentially expressed unigenes were selected to verify the accuracy of the rna-seq analysis by qrt-pcr, using the same rna that was used for rna-seq. even though most qrt-pcr results indicated smaller differences compared with the rna-seq analysis, there was a consistent expression tendency . however, unigene <dig> was an exception. in qrt-pcr, unigene <dig> showed no difference in the fertile and sterile buds, while rna-seq analysis indicated a significant difference. qrt-pcr verified that among the five unigenes annotated to pollen development, four  showed low abundance in sterile buds and one  showed no difference between fertile and sterile buds . unigene <dig> and unigene <dig>  which were predicted to encode callose synthases, showed down-regulation in sterile buds. unigene <dig> and unigene <dig>  mitochondrial genes that influence fertility directly, were confirmed to be up-regulated in sterile buds. in addition, unigene <dig>  unigene <dig> and unigene <dig>  which participate in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, amino acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, respectively, were all up-regulated in sterile buds.

discussion
here, the transcriptome reads of fertile and sterile buds were acquired using the illumina sequencing platform. then, because of the unavailability of the genome and transcriptome of b. napus at present, we assembled the transcriptome of the buds for further research. altogether,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained, but only  <dig>  unigenes  showed notable differences in expression, indicating that though the development of buds is a complicated and polygenic process, changes in a relatively small number of genes can transform the trait observably.

in the present study, unigenes that were annotated as direct regulatory genes of pollen development showed higher abundance in fertile buds. interestingly, unigene <dig>  was the first unigene that showed a difference in the regulatory network of anther development. unigene <dig> , which acts as upstream gene of unigene <dig>  showed no difference in expression  <cit> . therefore, it can be presumed that the lack of rfp emancipates the male-sterile gene in mitochondria. through a series of bioprocesses, this male-sterile gene leads to serial inhibition of the downstream genes by regulating bnnzz/spl, a pivotal regulator of sporogenesis  <cit> . consequently, the fertile buds become sterile before the formation of sporogenous cells. it has been reported that nuclear-mitochondrial interaction results in cms in previous studies  <cit> . these genes were inhibited rather than silenced, which consequently led to the formation of only a few pollen sacs in the sterile buds.

although orf <dig> and atp <dig> were both up-regulated in sterile buds, the change in orf <dig> expression was twice that of atp <dig>  which might have been caused by the truncation of most of the orf <dig> transcripts in the presence of rfp <cit> . nevertheless, what has been discussed above indicates that energy supply was much more plentiful in the fertile samples. we speculate that even though the orf224/atp <dig> gene was normally transcribed, the translation of it was defective, or the translated protein could not form a functional advanced structure. after all, the existence of integral orf <dig> led to the insufficiency of atpase protein  <dig>  which caused the energy deficiency in the sterile buds. in other studies, the candidate cytoplasmic male sterile genes have also had a close relationship with atpase genes, such as atp <dig>  atp <dig> <cit> .

comparative profiling was performed between the two transcriptomes. it was found that metabolism was still the principal activity in buds. unigenes that involved in pyrophosphatase and nucleoside-triphosphatase activity were down-regulated, suggesting an energy deficiency in sterile buds. the depauperate bud activity was elucidated by the weakening of transcription and translation, which is similar to the results of an earlier study of arabidopsis <cit> . different distributions of energy and materials may strongly influence fertility, and the regulation of sterility is very complicated. at the transcriptional level, mrna plays an important role; besides that, small rna also participates in the process and makes the regulation network more complete  <cit> .

we hypothesized that orf <dig> was integrally transcribed because of the lack of the rfp gene in pol cms and that this led to malformation of the advanced structure of atp <dig>  which subsequently caused an energy deficiency. therefore, the exchange of materials between the nucleus and cytoplasm was blocked. the expression of some genes that were located in the nucleus and function in pollen development was inhibited, and bnnzz/spl was the first inhibited gene in temporal order. finally, anthers could not differentiate sporogenous cells and became sterile in pol cms .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the different bioprocesses and genes that regulate pollen development were analyzed through a high-throughput sequencing approach. combined with the investigation of the orf224/atp <dig> gene region, we propose a speculative model for the sterility and restoration mechanism of pol cms. these results will promote the study of sterility mechanisms in more detail and the cloning of restorer genes. additionally, the assembled b. napus unigenes obtained in this study will contribute to other transcriptomic and genomic studies.
