BACKGROUND
in bacteria, the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites are typically clustered on the chromosome  <cit> . these biosynthetic gene clusters evolve rapidly relative to other genetic elements  <cit> , which likely contributes to the remarkable structural diversity observed among secondary metabolites. while the selective pressures driving secondary metabolite diversification remain largely unknown, the availability of large numbers of genome sequences has made it possible to begin to identify the evolutionary mechanisms that govern the biogenesis of structural novelty .

the genus streptomyces is well known as the source of structurally diverse secondary metabolites  <cit> . with nearly  <dig> named species, it is the most specious of all bacterial genera and comprises the majority of diversity within the family streptomycetaceae. streptomycetes are typically saprophytic and found in terrestrial soils and marine sediments. they also occur as plant endophytes, invertebrate mutualists, and human or plant pathogens  <cit> . within the genus streptomyces, the ‘mar4’ clade has been described as a largely marine-derived lineage  <cit> . based on available sequence data, it currently encompasses  <dig> cultured strains and  <dig> cloned sequences and displays  <dig>  % 16s rrna divergence. members of this clade consistently form two sub-clades represented by the type strains s. aculeolatus and s. synnematoformans  <cit> , which are the only named species within the mar <dig> lineage.

mar <dig> strains have previously been linked to the production of secondary metabolites broadly classified as hybrid isoprenoids   <cit> . these compounds are biosynthetic hybrids that derive part of their structures from five-carbon isoprene units. the addition of isoprene  can occur on a variety of chemical scaffolds thus creating considerable structural diversity. his frequently possess biological activity and thus their discovery is of interest to the pharmaceutical industry  <cit> . based on literature reports, hi production appears to be scattered throughout the streptomyces phylogeny and is a relatively rare part of secondary metabolism  <cit> . in contrast, some members of the mar <dig> clade have been observed to produce up to three distinct classes of hi secondary metabolites  <cit> . in addition, all mar <dig> strains tested produce at least one hi, an ability that has not been reported elsewhere in the streptomyces genus  <cit> . to date, hi secondary metabolites produced by mar <dig> strains include naphthoquionones in the napyradiomycin  <cit>  and marinone class  <cit> , the phthalazinone azamerone  <cit> , the phenazines lavanducyanin  <cit>  and marinophenazine  <cit> , and the highly unusual pyrrole nitropyrrolin  <cit> .

prenyltransferases  are responsible for the attachment of isoprene moieties to a variety of acceptor molecules and thus play a critical role in the biosynthesis of hi secondary metabolites. these enzymes also play important roles in the biosynthesis of primary metabolites including membrane sterols and lipoquinones  <cit> . one sub-group of ptases specific to secondary metabolism are the abba ptases, named in reference to the ααββ structural repeats that form a large β-barrel fold comprising the active center of the enzyme. abba ptases attach isoprene moieties to aromatic substrates and, to date, all characterized abba ptases are involved in the biosynthesis of hi secondary metabolites  <cit> .

abba ptases can be further divided into two sub-groups, both of which are found in fungi and bacteria. the first group is the indole abba ptases, which are responsible for the prenylation of indole substrates. one example is the enzyme cymd, which is responsible for prenylation of the bacterial cyclic peptide cyclomarin  <cit> . the second group is the ‘orf2’ ptases, which attach isoprenoid moieties to a variety of aromatic substrates including phenazines, naphthoquinones, and aminocoumarins. this group is named for the first characterized member, later renamed ‘nphb’, which is involved in naphterpin biosynthesis  <cit> . although the indole and orf <dig> ptases bear little sequence homology, they are thought to have arisen from a common ancestor  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, the unrelated ptase cnqpt <dig> is the only non-abba ptase involved in the production of a hi secondary metabolite. cnqpt <dig> is membrane-bound and responsible for the o-prenylation of phenazine in the biosynthesis of marinophenazine in the mar <dig> strain cnq- <dig>  <cit> .

the isoprene used in bacterial terpenoid biosynthesis is derived from either the mevalonate  or non-mevalonate pathways  <cit> . most bacteria, including streptomyces, possess the non-mevalonate pathway, the products of which are used in the biosynthesis of primary metabolites such as respiratory ubiquinones  <cit> . in cases where bacteria also possess the mev pathway in addition to the non-mevalonate pathway, it has always been found flanking a hi gene cluster  <cit>  suggesting that the isoprene produced by this biosynthetic route is used for secondary metabolism. feeding experiments have confirmed that the mev pathway can provide some or all of the isoprene incorporated into hi secondary metabolites  and led to the hypothesis that the mev pathway is a marker for hi production  <cit> . the availability of a large number of streptomyces genome sequences now provides the opportunity to further explore the association of the mev pathway with hi biosynthesis.

to date, most evidence for the presence of hi pathways in mar <dig> strains is based the detection and/or isolation of hi secondary metabolites from mar <dig> strains  <cit> . here we use comparative genomics to more rigorously test the hypothesis that mar <dig> strains are enriched in hi gene clusters relative to other streptomycetes. we show that mar <dig> ptases have undergone gene duplication events and been exchanged among unrelated gene clusters. we also show that most strains possessing hi gene clusters do not contain the mev pathway, suggesting it is not a good marker for the presence of this type of biosynthetic capacity. the evolutionary history of hi pathways in mar <dig> streptomycetes provides insight into how chemical diversity is generated in microbial secondary metabolism.

RESULTS
abba prenyltransferases in streptomyces genomes
one hundred and twenty streptomyces genome sequences were analyzed including  <dig> that were acquired from mar <dig> strains as part of this study . these genomes were initially screened for the presence of hi biosynthetic gene clusters  using  <dig> experimentally characterized orf <dig> and indole abba ptases as blast search queries . the top blast matches were incorporated into a phylogeny that included experimentally characterized enzymes representing both ptase sub-classes  <cit>  . in total,  <dig> ptases claded with either the orf <dig> or indole abba ptase lineages . these sequences showed varying levels of identity to the queries , yet all were assigned to abba ptase-specific pfam families. the  <dig> abba ptases were distributed among  <dig> strains , some of which contained more than one of these genes . the  <dig> mar <dig> strains contained from  <dig> to  <dig> abba ptases per genome. with the exception of a single indole ptase in strain cnq- <dig>  all of these fell within the orf <dig> class. of the  <dig> non-mar <dig> strains,  <dig> contained abba ptases. of these, one contained three, five contained two, and  <dig> contained one copy of this gene. in contrast to the mar <dig> abba ptases, these could be delineated into  <dig> indole and  <dig> orf <dig> ptases.fig.  <dig> ptase distributions among genome sequences. a percentage of genomes that contain abba ptases. b distribution of indole and orf <dig> abba ptases among the  <dig> strains that possessed these genes



distribution of abba ptases among streptomyces spp
the phylogenetic relationships of the  <dig> strains that contained abba ptases were examined in the context of a streptomyces species tree that included the  <dig> strains used in this study . this phylogeny was generated from the shared, single copy housekeeping genes atpd and rpob. the mar <dig> clade is well delineated within this phylogeny, which supports previous 16s rrna gene sequence analyses  <cit> . the results clearly show that abba ptases are sparsely distributed throughout the genus with the exception of the mar <dig> clade and a distantly related clade designated ‘s. coelicolor’ in reference to its best-characterized member. these two clades are composed entirely of abba ptase-containing strains, with members of the mar <dig> clade containing on average five abba ptases per genome compared with one per genome for members of the s. coelicolor clade. the sporadic distribution of abba ptases throughout the tree largely conforms to previous reports of hi production in this genus  <cit> .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny of the  <dig> streptomyces strains used in this study. phylogeny is based on concatenated atpd and rpob amino acid sequences. bootstrap values >50 % are indicated at their respective nodes . colors indicate the number of abba ptases found in each genome. the mar <dig> and s. coelicolor clades are indicated. sequences derived from two pseudonocardia genomes were used to root the tree



orf <dig> abba ptase phylogeny
an orf <dig> abba ptase phylogeny was constructed to assess the evolutionary relationships among the sequences identified in this study . the initial bifurcation in the orf <dig> phylogeny reveals two clades, the smaller of which appears at the bottom of the tree and contains the previously characterized cloq and novq ptases, which are responsible for the prenylation of the aminocoumarin molecules chlorobiocin and novobiocin, respectively  <cit> . none of the mar <dig> sequences fall in this clade. the larger, sister clade includes ptases known to prenylate naphthoquinone  and phenazine  scaffolds  <cit> . all of the ptases found in the mar <dig> genomes fell within this larger clade. the mar <dig> ptases could be further delineated into thirteen highly supported sub-clades. these sub-clades were each assigned prenyltransferase clade  numbers . ptc <dig> contains a single prenyltransferase but was sufficiently separated from the other sequences to assign it an independent clade number. the only two experimentally characterized orf <dig> ptases that clade with mar <dig> sequences are both from the napyradiomycin  biosynthetic pathway   <cit> .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny of orf <dig> abba ptases with mid-point rooting. the phylogeny contains all of the orf <dig> abba ptases identified in the  <dig> streptomyces genomes  including  <dig> that are experimentally characterized . homologs found in non-mar <dig> genomes are in black, while those from mar <dig> strains are color-coded based on strain. mar <dig> ptases are delineated into  <dig> prenyltransferase clades . each mar <dig> ptase is also assigned a hybrid isoprenoid gene cluster  number, which defines the gene cluster in which it was observed. bootstrap values >50 % are indicated at their respective nodes . examples of horizontal gene transfer  and gene duplication are indicated. two of the characterized ptases  are from the mar <dig> strain s. aculeolatus nrrl 18422



orf <dig> evolution
by comparing the orf <dig> phylogeny  with the species tree , it becomes clear that closely related ptases occur in distantly related strains. for example, the ptase that is sister to ptc <dig> occurs in s. griseoflavus tu <dig>  which is distantly related to the mar <dig> clade in the streptomyces phylogeny. this suggests that these ptases have been exchanged by hgt. in other cases, there is evidence of ptase duplication followed by divergence. this is demonstrated for the sister ptc <dig> and ptc <dig> clades, which share the same phylogenies and occur in the same taxa .

to better resolve the relationships among the mar <dig> strains and the orf <dig> ptases, a species phylogeny was generated using five single-copy housekeeping genes derived from the  <dig> mar <dig> genome sequences . a likelihood analysis was then used to predict the ancestral node for each ptase based on their distributions within the phylogeny. this analysis predicts that no ptases were present in the mar <dig> common ancestor, suggesting that all were acquired by hgt. in addition, it is predicted that nine of  <dig> ptases were acquired more than once within the mar <dig> clade while three were lost in certain strains following acquisition events. specifically, ptc <dig> and ptc <dig> are predicted to have been lost in the cnq- <dig> lineage, while ptc <dig> is predicted to have been lost in the cnq- <dig> lineage. five ptases are found in seven or more mar <dig> strains  while all others  are present in four or fewer. in all cases, the phylogeny within each ptc  is largely congruent with that of the mar <dig> species phylogeny  suggesting that, once acquired, these genes follow a vertical model of inheritance.fig.  <dig> evolutionary relationships between mar <dig> strains and ptases. a mar <dig> phylogeny generated from five single-copy housekeeping genes . maximum likelihood  and maximum parsimony  trees showed the same topology. bootstrap values >50 % are indicated at the respective nodes  based on  <dig> replicates. black circles and associated ptc numbers indicate predicted ptase acquisition points with the % fill of the circle indicating the proportional likelihood that the ptase was present at that node . note: some ptases are predicted to have been acquired at multiple nodes. b boxes depict ptase distributions among mar <dig> strains . numbers indicate the ptc. c the ptase phylogeny for each ptc was largely congruent with that of the species phylogeny for the strains in which it was observed. as an example, the phylogeny of ptc <dig> is depicted in comparison with the strain phylogeny. the likelihood analysis predicts two independent acquisition events for ptc <dig> after which the ptase phylogeny supports a model of vertical inheritance. bootstrap values >50 % are indicated at the respective nodes . img gene id and the source strain for each ptase are given



hybrid isoprenoid biosynthetic gene clusters 
we next analyzed the gene neighborhoods surrounding each mar <dig> ptase and sought to identify gene clusters that putatively encode for the biosynthesis of hi secondary metabolites. the hi biosynthetic gene clusters  observed in different strains were then grouped when shared gene content and multigeneblast  <cit>  analyses revealed sufficient similarity to predict they encode structurally related secondary metabolites. this led to the identification of  <dig> hibgcs of which only one could be linked to a previously characterized pathway   <cit> . it is generally difficult to predict the scaffold that will be prenylated based on hibgc gene content or orf <dig> phylogeny and thus little can be inferred about the secondary metabolites encoded by the remaining  <dig> gene clusters. nonetheless, hibgc <dig> contains a type iii polyketide synthase, which would be expected for the production of the naphthoquinone moiety of compounds in the marinone series . likewise, hibgc <dig> contains a full suite of phenazine biosynthesis genes and is therefore predicted to encode the production of the known mar <dig> hi lavanducyanin. however, these bioinformatic predictions remain to be experimentally verified.table  <dig> summary of putative hi gene clusters  identified in mar <dig> strains. the ptases present in each hibgc are indicated along with the annotation of key biosynthetic genes

two hibgcs  did not meet the criteria to be assigned to the same cluster, however their gene content is largely identical except that hibgc <dig> contains an additional set of genes including a second ptase and a type iii polyketide synthase. because hibgc <dig> occurs on a relatively short contig, further sequencing is required to determine if these two clusters are in fact the same. four of the hibgcs contain more than one ptase . in each of these cases, the ptases are distantly related to each other . for example, hibgc <dig> contains two ptases that belong to ptcs  <dig> and  <dig>  and thus appear to have been independently recruited into the cluster. this is supported by the likelihood analysis, which predicts that ptc <dig> and ptc <dig> were acquired at different points in the evolutionary history of strains cnb- <dig> and cnh- <dig> . overall, the varying gene content among the mar <dig> hibgcs reveals the potential biosynthetic diversity maintained by these strains.

evidence for ptase rearrangement
in most cases, all of the ptases that fall within a single ptc occur in the same hibgc . there are, however, three notable exceptions , where orthologous ptases are found in different hibgcs. a closer look reveals that the four ptc <dig> sequences are found in three different hibgcs, each of which contains from  <dig> to  <dig> ptases . the presence of orthologous ptases in different gene clusters suggests they are actively exchanged and can be involved in the production of distinct secondary metabolites. thus, ptase phylogeny is not a good predictor of the secondary metabolites produced by hibgcs.fig.  <dig> ptase rearrangement within mar <dig> strains. four hibgcs are illustrated with putative gene functions  indicated by color. homologs are indicated by gray bars. abba ptases are shown in red, and the ptc associated with each ptase indicated. the strain containing each hibgc are labeled



mevalonate pathway distribution
the  <dig> streptomyces genomes were examined for the six genes that comprise the mev pathway to determine its association with hibgcs. thirteen genomes were found to contain the complete mev pathway . of these, seven were mar <dig> strains. in contrast,  <dig> strains contained abba ptases. the mev pathway was never found more than once in a single genome. of the  <dig> strains that contained the mev pathway,  <dig> contained at least one abba ptase. in the two strains that contained the mev pathway but lacked an abba ptase , the mev pathway was found in close proximity to genes involved in terpene biosynthesis  suggesting it may be involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid secondary metabolites.

the seven mar <dig> strains that contained the mev pathway also contained the nap gene cluster, supporting previous reports that the isoprene incorporated into the napyradiomycins is derived from mev  <cit> . however, the mev pathway was often found on short contigs making it difficult to establish its proximity to the nap pathway. in all other cases, the mev pathway was found in close proximity to an abba ptase . thus, it appears that when present, the mev pathway is generally associated with genes for secondary metabolism, however these genes do not appear to be consistently associated with hibgcs and are often absent in strains with the genetic potential to produce his.

discussion
access to genome sequence data is providing unprecedented opportunities to explore the evolution of secondary metabolite biosynthesis  <cit> . studies in this area have largely focused on modular enzyme systems, such as those encoding non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides. in contrast, relatively little is known about the diversity and distributions of gene clusters responsible for hi biosynthesis and how these systems evolve to create new secondary metabolite diversity. his encompass a wide spectrum of biosynthetic paradigms, however a consistent feature of the associated gene clusters is the presence of ptases, which facilitate the addition of isoprene moieties to the secondary metabolite.

using a dataset of  <dig> streptomyces genomes, we provide additional bioinformatic support for the hypothesis that mar <dig> streptomycetes are enriched in ptases relative to other streptomycetes  <cit> . interestingly, all but one of the mar <dig> ptases falls within the orf <dig> class of abba ptases. this is unlike non-mar <dig> streptomycetes, which contain approximately equal numbers of indole and orf <dig> ptases. abba ptases were also enriched in the s. coelicolor a <dig> clade, however these strains contained on average one copy per genome compared to five in mar <dig> strains. outside of these two clades, ptases were sparsely distributed throughout the streptomyces species tree.

likelihood analyses predict that the mar <dig> ptases were acquired via multiple hgt events . the alternative and less parsimonious hypothesis is that the ptases were acquired via hgt by a common mar <dig> ancestor and subsequently lost by many of the strains. regardless of which scenario is correct, hgt appears to have played a major role in the acquisition of ptases by mar <dig> strains . there is also evidence that ptases have been lost in some lineages, duplicated in others, and exchanged among hibgcs, revealing the dynamic evolutionary processes that are acting on this enzyme class. the consistent occurrence and relatively high abundance of ptases in mar <dig> strains suggests they provide a selective advantage to these bacteria.

all of the mar <dig> ptases could be assigned to  <dig> hibgcs, each of which is predicted to encode the production of a distinct hi molecule. while there was generally a strong correlation between the phylogenetic relationships among the ptases and the hibgcs in which they occurred, there was also clear evidence that ptases are exchanged among hibgcs . while it might be assumed that ptase duplication followed by divergence would be a primary mechanism by which hibgcs evolve to generate new structural diversity, there were no cases where a single hibgc contained paralogous ptases. in fact, in all cases where multiple ptases were found in the same gene cluster  the ptases were distantly related to each other , and in one case , ptases in the same cluster are predicted to have been acquired at different points during mar <dig> evolution . abba ptases have been shown to prenylate a variety of substrates in vitro  <cit> , suggesting they could be functionally incorporated into new hibgcs. these results suggest that a primary mechanism of hibgc evolution is the acquisition of new ptases. in the one case where there is clear evidence for ptc duplication , the paralogous ptases in each stain occur in different hibgcs. given that some orthologous ptases occurred in different hibgcs, which implies they encode the biosynthesis of distinct molecules , a generalized conclusion of this study is that ptase phylogeny is not a reliable predictor of hibgc content and, by extension, secondary metabolite production. furthermore, ptase exchange among gene clusters appears to be a mechanism by which novel hibgcs evolve. this finding is in accordance with a recent study of biosynthetic gene cluster evolution which showed that certain portions of gene clusters can act as independent evolutionary entities, and that the merger of these biosynthetic subunits is a mechanism that nature has used to generate structural novelty in secondary metabolism  <cit> .

among the mar <dig> orf <dig> ptases, only nap has been formally linked to its secondary metabolic products  <cit> . hibgc <dig> contains all of the genes required for phenazine biosynthesis , suggesting it may be responsible for lavanducyanin biosynthesis . surprisingly, however, the ptase in this cluster  does not clade with the characterized sequences epzp and ppzp, which are known to prenylate phenazine scaffolds  <cit> . hibgc <dig> contains a type iii polyketide synthase, suggesting it may encode the production of the marinone class of naphthoquinones. this hibgc was observed in cnq- <dig>  which is known to produce compounds in the marinone series  <cit> . however, experimental evidence will be required to confirm this hypothesis. the strains containing hibgc <dig>  also produce marinones  <cit> , suggesting this version of the gene cluster may be truncated due to inadequate sequencing . it is difficult to predict the types of molecules produced by the remainder of the uncharacterized hibgcs. there are examples where ptases are not clustered with the genes required to produce the entire hi scaffold  <cit> , creating additional challenges for structure prediction. regardless, the large number of uncharacterized pathways identified in mar <dig> strains suggests they possess the genetic potential to produce a greater diversity of hi secondary metabolites than formerly appreciated.

the mev pathway has previously been associated with hi biosynthesis  <cit> . from our analysis, only  <dig> of  <dig> strains contained this pathway, including  <dig> of  <dig> strains that contain an abba ptase . in the two strains that contain the mev pathway but lack an abba ptase, the mev pathway is associated with terpenoid biosynthetic genes suggesting that this isoprene is also incorporated into secondary metabolism. these observations lend support to the hypothesis that when present in streptomyces genomes, the mev pathway provides isoprene for secondary metabolism. however, the infrequency of the mev pathway in abba ptase-containing genomes indicates that it is not a reliable marker for hi production.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the results of this study support the hypothesis that mar <dig> strains are enriched in the biosynthetic machinery required to produce hi secondary metabolite relative to other streptomycetes. we also show that gene duplication, hgt, and gene rearrangement are involved in the evolution of hibgcs and, by extension, the generation of hi chemical novelty. secondary metabolites have previously been linked to functional adaptation in actinobacteria  <cit> , therefore the accumulation of his in this clade could be related to the colonization of a particular environmental niche. the goal of understanding why such a diversity of hi gene clusters have evolved and been maintained in mar <dig> strains will require the challenging task of linking these molecules to their ecological roles in the environment.
