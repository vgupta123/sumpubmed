BACKGROUND
most protein families can be divided into functionally distinct subfamilies. such subfamilies exhibit characteristic properties which manifest for instance as binding specificity of regulatory proteins, substrate specificity of enzymes, and pore selectivity of channels and transporters. functional differences are often linked to sequence characteristics in regions which are conserved throughout the protein superfamily. this is because conserved domains define the fold of the functional protein core or provide catalytic residues. recognition of subfamily-specific deviations at such sites can be valuable for elucidating mechanistic principles of the protein family by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent functional analysis of the mutants. an automated approach to identify relevant deviations should  provide the ability to take into account a large number of reference sequences,  determine sequence conservation, i. e. positions of high information content, and  visualize deviations, i.e. subfamily characteristics, relative to the information content in a graphical output which is easy to comprehend.

implementation
one sophisticated way of presenting sequence conservation is to display a sequence logo  <cit> . here, the information content i  of each alignment position i is defined inverse to the uncertainty h by the equation

i=log⁡2|Σ|−h=log⁡2|Σ|+∑j∈|Σ|pij⋅log⁡2pij

with |Σ| being the cardinality of the used alphabet, i.e.  <dig> for dna and  <dig> for protein sequences, and pij being the frequency of residue j at this position . each position is displayed as a stack of residue symbols whose heights lij represent their proportion of the information content:

lij= pij·i

protein sequence logos are often adjusted to the background frequency of each amino acid in the alignment  <cit> . for simplicity, the variable name i  will be used in the following for both, information content with or without frequency correction. generally, both approaches are compatible with subfamily logos and have been implemented in the algorithm.

contrary to a sequence logo that depicts sequence conservation, here, it is desired to display the relevance of deviations at conserved positions. the recently published pairwise hmm logo approach does align the sequence logos of two subfamilies  <cit> . this certainly facilitates the identification of relevant deviant positions, but one still has to inspect position by position and judge different symbol heights by eye. subfamiliy logos provide a very intuitive display. they are derived by subtracting from the frequency sij of a residue j within a pre-defined subset of sequences, i. e. a subfamily, the frequency rij of this residue in the remaining set of sequences for each position i. the difference is then weighted by the overall information content i computed from all sequences and the residue is plotted with a symbol height of sij:

sij= ·fs˜r˜

RESULTS
fig.  <dig> displays two sections of a protein alignment  which consists of a total of  <dig> aquaporin sequences. two functionally distinct subfamilies are represented by  <dig> aquaglyceroporins , and  <dig> water-specific aquaporins . from the latter, another water-specific subfamily consisting of  <dig> plant tonoplast intrinsic proteins  can be separated.

the frequency-corrected sequence logo on the top highlights conserved positions around the two canonical asn-pro-ala  motifs. the scale of the ordinate is in bits. sequence conservation is further indicated by a color scale below the logo based on a structural matrix integrated into texshade. the triangles mark positions where the glpf, aqp, and tip subfamilies deviate as shown before in various publications  <cit> . these positions are directly connected to function because they contribute to the layout of the selective pore constriction.

three frequency-corrected subfamily logos are shown below. readability is greatly improved when upside-down symbols are tinted by 50%. this gives the impression of a reflective surface with a focus on the positive, subfamily-relevant residue symbols. the output is intuitive and basically self-explaining. positions which are conserved throughout do not appear in the subfamily logos, see for instance the npa motifs at positions 63– <dig> and 194– <dig>  however, sequence deviations become visible dependent on the information content, e.g. val <dig> vs. arg in the tip subfamily, or asp <dig> and ser <dig>  respectively, in the glpf or aqp subfamilies. deviations are less pronounced at positions with a higher number of possible residues due to the lower information content. nevertheless, subfamily characteristics are still visible if relevant, e.g. at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the algorithm further accepts a threshold bit-value above which a deviant residue is additionally highlighted by a symbol . empirically, this value is set to log <dig>  for proteins, which corresponds to the presence of one particular residue in 25% of all sequences or 50% of the subfamily, and log <dig>  for dna sequences. the threshold value can be manually adjusted to match the alignment situation in question. it may also be used in the future to indicate statistical evaluations of the residue distribution. inherently, best results are obtained when only two subfamilies are compared.

currently, subfamily logos are implemented in texshade , i.e. a latex macro package for setting and shading multiple sequence alignments  <cit> . some sample code is displayed in fig.  <dig> depicting that a small number of commands leads to satisfying output. texshade provides numerous additional commands for individual adjustments of the output and comprehensive labeling. however, implementation of a subfamily logo extension into software that provides a graphical user interface and texshade output, such as strap  <cit>  or the san diego supercomputer center biology workbench , is strongly encouraged. further, integration of the subfamily logo algorithm into local or web-based sequence logo plotting tools should be straight forward.

CONCLUSIONS
subfamily logos are an extension to the classical application of sequence logos. they provide a novel tool to intuitively visualize subfamily sequence characteristics. the validity of the method was confirmed by analysis of  <dig> aligned aquaporin sequences and correct identification of subfamily-specific sequence deviations. their relationship to sequence logos makes it easy to integrate them into existing logo software.
