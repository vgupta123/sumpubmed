BACKGROUND
jatropha curcas is becoming one of the world's key crops for biodiesel production  <cit> . oil containing a high amount of unsaturated fatty acid can find an application as biodiesel feed stock. to make the production of jatropha profitable and sustainable, genetic improvement of oil yield and quality is demanded. however, oil traits cannot be evaluated until the seeds are harvested and analyzed in laboratory, and detailed selective breeding has not been carried out. meanwhile molecular breeding in jatropha has not been started due to lack of molecular bases of economically important traits such as seed yield, seed oil traits, biotic or abiotic stress resistance.

most economically important traits are quantitative and determined by many genes and gene complex where are described as quantitative trait loci . traditional methods of genetic improvement of quantitative traits have relied mainly on phenotype and pedigree information  <cit> , which are easily influenced by environmental factors. to conduct marker assisted selection  for genetic improvement of oil yield and quality in jatropha, the molecular bases of seed oil traits need to be understood by identifying genomic regions that contain favorite loci, i.e. qtl analysis. qtl analysis has been performed to detect the genetic bases of important agronomic or physiological traits, providing valuable information for trait improvement. genetic markers have made it possible to detect qtls that are significantly associated with traits, and made selection more effective  <cit> . genetic response can be improved by including the qtls in marker-assisted selection, which is a method of selection that makes use of phenotypic, genotypic and pedigree data  <cit> . moreover, mas for oil traits improvement will be much advantageous compared to traditional breeding because seed oil traits cannot be measured at early stage or in field. the use of dna markers for selection in jatropha can greatly reduce breeding scale. by using mas, decisions can be made at the nursery stage, regarding which individuals should be retained as breeding stock, and which should be removed.

to conduct qtl analysis, most appropriate crosses need to be selected to generate sufficient genetic variations both on dna and phenotype levels. qtl analyses of total oil content have been made in a number of crops, including oilseed rape <cit> , soybean <cit> , maize <cit> , and sunflower <cit> . recent surveys have shown large variations in content and fatty acid composition of seed oil of arabidopsis, suggesting populations derived from selected crosses will be useful for investigating these traits  <cit> .

diversity in gene expression is one of the mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity among individuals and regarded as one of quantitative traits  <cit> . analysis of determinants of candidate gene expression not only helps in understanding the mechanisms for phenotypic variation but also provides an approach to improve phenotypes via the modulation of gene expression <cit> . with advances in gene expression profiling, an approach named "genetical genomics" has been put forward to identify the determinants of gene expression  <cit> . this approach treats mrna expression levels as quantitative traits in a segregating population and maps expression qtl  that control expression levels in vivo. for almost any gene analyzed in a segregating population, eqtl analysis can identify the genomic regions influencing its expression level. eqtl that map to the same genetic location as the gene whose transcript is being measured generally indicate the presence of a cis-acting regulatory polymorphism in the gene . eqtl that map distant to the location of the gene being assayed most likely identify the location of trans-acting regulators  that may control the expression of a number of genes elsewhere in the genome. the genetical genomics approach has been employed for identifying eqtl regulating gene expression  <cit> .

recently, we established a first generation genetic linkage map of jatropha using  <dig> microsatellite and snp markers covering  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> , thus providing a necessary tool for a whole genome scan for qtls and eqtls affecting economically important traits including seed oil traits. among the fatty acid present in the jatropha seed oil, linoleic acid , oleic acid , palmitic acid  and stearic acid  are dominant compositions. oleic and linoleic acids are the major constituents of jatropha oil  <cit> . the breeding goal for jatropha seed oil trait improvement is to increase total oil content and oleic acid, and decrease palmitic content  <cit> . in this paper, we describe the genetic bases of these seed fatty acid composition and content traits through qtl mapping with a backcrossing population consisting  <dig> individuals. on the other hand, seed oil is stored in subcellular organelles called oil bodies. proteome composition of the jatropha oil bodies revealed oleosins as the major component affecting oil traits  <cit> . three jatropha oleosin genes, namely olei, oleii and oleiii, were isolated  <cit> . here, we developed snps of the three oleosin genes in the qtl mapping population, which were subsequently mapped onto the linkage map. we determined expression variations of the three genes in the qtl mapping population, conducted an eqtl analysis on oleosin gene expressions and provided new information for possible modulation of oleosin genes to improve oil traits in jatropha.

RESULTS
trait analysis
fatty acid composition, total oil content of jatropha seeds and gene expression levels of oleosin genes were measured in the qtl mapping population. the frequency distributions of the traits showed a continuous distribution , revealing complex genetic bases of these traits. as expected for an interspecific cross, distribution of phenotypic values in the progeny showed bi-directional transgressive segregations for all traits . c18: <dig> in j. curcas is higher than in j. integerrima, while total oil content in j. integerrima is  <dig> %, much higher than in j. curcas. the data implied that j. integerrima germplasm could be applied for hybrid breeding to improve agronomic traits such as total oil content.

correlation analysis among these traits was performed . c18: <dig> showed a significantly negative correlation with c18: <dig> and c16: <dig>  especially the c18: <dig> correlated with c18: <dig> with a high coefficient - <dig> , implying that there could be common genetic factors affecting these two compositions. the expression levels of olei, oleii and oleiii showed a highly positive correlation with each other. olei expression level was significantly correlated with c16: <dig>  the correlation coefficients between expression levels of oleosin genes and total oil content were low but significant. the significant but low values of correlation coefficients implied genetic bases of fatty acid composition and total oil content were complex, and oleosin genes could be involved the multiple genetic factors affecting these oil traits.

p values are as follows: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> .

qtl and eqtl mapping
the linkage map, covering  <dig>  cm of the genome, converged into  <dig> linkage groups consisting of  <dig> dna markers. the average distance between markers was  <dig>  cm. most of the linkage groups were consistent with those described previously  <cit> .

qtl analyses were performed on the means of fatty acid composition, total oil content and expression levels of olei, oleii and oleiii . we detected  <dig> qtls and  <dig> eqtls for all traits examined. individual eqtl or qtl were detected with percentage of variation explained   <dig> % to  <dig> %, and  <dig> of them had pve exceeding 10%. qtls or eqtls with positive and negative allelic effects were identified, with a positive effect implying a higher value for the trait conferred by the allele from pzm <dig> and vice versa .

qtls for fatty acid composition and total oil content
eighteen qtls were identified dispersed among all the linkage groups except lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  a qtl of highly significant effect was determined to be located on lg <dig> explaining 36% of variation of c18: <dig> composition, and was found to be associated with c18: <dig> compositions . interestingly, another qtl on lg <dig> explained  <dig> % of variation of c18: <dig> composition was also associated with c18: <dig> compositions. higher values for c18: <dig> were conferred by the allele from pzm <dig>  while higher values for c18: <dig> from hybrid ci <dig> 

four qtls were detected underlying total oil content. at the three qtls on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, the alleles from hybrid ci <dig> contributed high total oil content. the most effective qtl was spotted on lg <dig> explaining  <dig> % of the variation, whose higher value for total oil content was conferred by the allele from hybrid ci <dig> 

favorite allele's effects
there were strong qtls for c18: <dig> and total oil content detected on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. mean phenotypic values of each trait were calculated for those progeny with the alternate alleles of the microsatellite markers, inherited from the j. integerrima  or j. curcas . a two-way anova was performed on the progeny using two allelic combinations  from markers linked to qtls in order to investigate associations between phenotypic traits and genotypes of the qtls. the phenotype values of each allelic combination of the qtls are listed in figure  <dig>  significant differences of phenotype means among different allelic combinations were identified, revealing the effects of alternative alleles inherited from the parents.

progenies with aa genotype at the marker jcuint <dig> located in qc18:1- <dig>  showed the higher c18: <dig> content  than aa . by contrast, progeny with aa genotype at the marker jatr <dig> located in qoilc- <dig>  showed the higher total oil content  than aa  . these results suggested the effect of the two qtls are opposite on these two key oil traits and favorite alleles were differentially from j. curcas and j. integerrima.

eqtls for oleosin genes
snp markers were developed in olei, oleii and oleiii genes , which were mapped on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively .

olei and oleiii were mapped on lg <dig> where the qtls qc18:0- <dig>  qc18:1- <dig> and qoleiii underlying c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and oleiii expression clustered. negative additive effect value of qoleiii- <dig> indicated that j. curcas alleles were positive for oleiii expressions, of which lod score was  <dig> . this eqtl of oleiii was localized near oleiii gene and overlapped with the qtls controlling c18: <dig> and c18: <dig>  revealing a cis- or trans-element for oleiii which subsequently controlling the c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> 

one eqtl on lg <dig> qolei- <dig> was detected underlying olei expression with lod  <dig>  . additive effect value of qolei- <dig> was positive, indicating that j. integerrima alleles were positive for olei expressions. to find as many putative qtls  as possible, and to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships among examined traits, a threshold eqtl of  <dig>  for declaring a suggestive eqtl was employed. low thresholds may not be useful in plant breeding programs but they have been shown to help in understanding relationships among traits  <cit> .

oleii was located on lg <dig>  one eqtl for oleii was detected on lg <dig> with lod  <dig> , which closed to qc18:0- <dig>  it is suggested that a trans-element for oleii could harbor in this region which controlling the c18: <dig>  additive effect values indicated that j. curcas alleles were negative, indicating that the effect of j. curcas alleles was positive for oleii expressions.

discussion
development of inter-specific populations
to broaden the genetic diversity of cultivated crops and to identify qtls associated with beneficial traits, such as yield, grain quality and disease resistance, development of inter-specific populations is a feasible strategy <cit> . we developed around  <dig> ssr markers in jatropha, but very low polymorphism was detected within j. curcas, indicating the genetic variation was very limited within j. curcas. thereby, we successful constructed a qtl/eqtl mapping population by crossing j. curcas to j. integerrima and generating a backcrossing population, and observed enhanced genetic diversity on dna, rna and phenotype levels, which was the prerequisite for qtl and eqtl detection.

for oil trait improvement, the interspecific hybridization approach is also viewed as a viable method to introgress the traits of interest, i.e. namely more liquid olein in oil palm  <cit> . with mas, selection can be carried out in segregating generations of interspecific hybrids and their backcrosses more discriminately using molecular markers linked to the specific fatty acids. we investigated effects of the qtls on oil traits and found that favorite alleles were originated from not only j. curcas but also j. integerrima. c18: <dig> in j. curcas was higher than in j. integerrima, while total oil content in j. integerrima was  <dig> %, much higher than in j. curcas . consistent to this result, qc18:1- <dig> and qoilc- <dig>  controlling c18: <dig> and total oil content respectively, were detected with the favorite alleles originated from j. curcas and j. integerrima respectively. therefore, the qtl mapping population will be very useful for transferring favorite alleles form the two parents by further backcrossing and marker assisted selection.

various germplasms were successfully utilized for development of chromosome segment substitution lines for studies on pest and disease resistance and other agronomic triats in rice  <cit> . here we generated backcross populations for map construction and qtl mapping, which required less time to be developed and being 'immortal' for future qtl mapping due to jatropha's perennial life cycle. meanwhile, the specific advantage of backcross populations is that, the populations can be further utilized to develop chromosome segment substitution lines for marker-assisted backcross breeding. the chromosome segment substitution lines will provide a valuable tool for jatropha germplasm enhancement, and can be expected to reveal the genetic basis of traits specific to the donor j. integerrima.

linkage or pleiotropic effect of genes in qtl cluster
several chromosomal regions were associated with more than two traits indicating either linkage or pleiotropic effect. we detected a qtl cluster controlling c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> contents on the same region, i.e. closed to marker jcuint <dig> on lg <dig> and jcuint <dig> on lg <dig> with the additive value of c18: <dig> opposite to that of c18: <dig>  this could explain the strong negative correlation between c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> , which was consistent to the fact that linoleic acid is desaturated from oleic acid. especially on lg <dig>  the qtl was detected with a highly significant effect, accounting for  <dig> % of the variation. it is revealed that either certain genes coexisted in these qtls or a certain gene with pleiotropic effect in fatty acid metabolism pathway by modulating both c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> contents simultaneously. it will be meaningful to conduct fine mapping of these qtls, isolate the target genes, and understand whether linkage or pleiotropic effect. the qtl regions were still distant to the flanking markers with linkage distance larger than  <dig> cm. fine mapped qtl will speed up genetic improvement through mas  <cit> . construction of a high-resolution genetic linkage map of jatropha is underway, which will lay a solid foundation for a variety of future genetic and genomic studies, including qtl fine mapping and marker assisted selection.

eqtl analysis of oleosin genes
to examine the function and modulation of oleosin genes in jatropha, we determined the expression levels of olei, oleii and oleiii in the qtl mapping population, and conducted analysis with an approach named "genetical genomics" for identifying the genomic regions influencing gene expression  <cit> . the correlation of a structural gene's map position and its eqtl provides an indication of its regulation  <cit> . if the position of one gene and its eqtl are congruent, cis-regulation could be inferred, which means that the allelic polymorphism of the gene itself, or closely linked regulatory elements, directly impact the gene's expression. in this study, the eqtl for oleosin genes do not colocalize with these gene. this result suggests that the observed differences in oleosin gene expressions could be the consequences of trans-regulation, which means that gene expression is mainly regulated by trans-acting factors. a similar phenomenon has been observed for a set of genes involved in the biosynthesis of lignin in eucalyptus. most of these genes were significantly influenced by two eqtls on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas the structural genes were distributed throughout the entire genome  <cit> .

the significant but low correlations were observed between oil traits and the expressions of oleosin genes. similar phenomenon was reported by yin et al  <cit> . they reported that the significant correlation between the expression of both gmrcaa and gmrcab and rubisco initial activity, photosynthetic rate, and seed yield indicated that these genes could play a role in increasing photosynthetic capacity and seed yield. however, the correlation coefficients between gene expression and rubisco initial activity, photosynthetic rate, and seed yield were relatively small. this was also reflected by the fact that no coincident qtl  was found between gene expression levels and the other three traits. thus, they concluded that factors other than gmrcaa and gmrcab limited photosynthetic capacity and seed yield. in our study, significant but low correlations between oil traits and the expressions of oleosin genes indicated that these genes could affect fatty acid composition and content; meanwhile, there should be other complex factors together with oleosin genes affecting oil traits.

the three eqtls will provide possible approaches to oil trait improvement beyond previous qtl mapping results. interestingly, oleiii gene, eqtl of oleiii qoleiii- <dig> and qtl of qc18:0- <dig> and qc18:1- <dig> were clustered on the same region on lg <dig>  to further address whether a cis- or trans-element for oleiii harbored on lg <dig> subsequently controls the fatty acid compositions, fine mapping the two loci is still needed. only eqtl of oleiii was coincident with qtl for oil composition, this result could be resulted from function differentiation of oleosin genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we identified  <dig> qtls underlying the oil traits and  <dig> eqtls of the oleosin acid genes. among them, qc18:1- <dig>  qoilc- <dig> and qoleiii- <dig>  controlling oleic acid, total oil content and oleosin gene expression respectively, were detected with relatively high contribution rates  and could be expected to be applied in mas by integrating more markers in these region. these data represents the first successful detection of qtls/eqtls underlying key agronomic traits in jatropha.
