BACKGROUND
although rna interference  has been successfully used for studying gene functions in both plants and invertebrates, many practical obstacles need to be overcome before it becomes an established tool for use in mammalian systems  <cit> . one of the important problems is designing effective sirna sequences for target genes. the short interfering rna  responsible for rna interference varies markedly in its gene silencing efficacy in mammalian genes, where the gene silencing effectiveness depends very much on the target sequence positions  selected from the target gene  <cit> . since different sirnas synthesized for various positions induce different levels of gene silencing, the selection of the target sequence is critical to the effectiveness of the sirna. we therefore need useful criteria for gene silencing efficacy when we are designing sirna sequences  <cit> .

zamore et al. and jayasena et al. showed that 5' end of the antisense strand that was incorporated into rna-induced silencing complex  more efficiently was less tightly paired to its complement and began with an a-t pair, whereas the strand incorporated less efficiently had a g-c terminus  <cit> . other factors reported to be related to gene silencing efficacy are gc content, sequence features, specific motif sequences and secondary structures of mrna. several sirna design rules/guidelines using efficacy-related factors have been reported  <cit> .

although sequence characteristics for sirna designs seem to be the most important factor determining effective sirna sequences, there are few consistencies among the reported rules/guidelines  <cit> . this implies that these rules/guidelines might result in the generation of many candidates and thus make it difficult to extract a few for synthesizing sirnas. furthermore, there is in rnai a risk of off-target regulation: a possibility that the sirna will silence other genes whose sequences are similar to that of the target gene. when we use gene silencing for studying gene functions, we have to first somehow select high-potential sirna candidate sequences and then eliminate possible off-target ones  <cit> .

here we therefore focus on identifying high-potential sirna sequences from many possible candidates and propose the prediction methods for selecting effective sirna target sequences from many possible candidate sequences by using the radial basis function  technique and decision tree learning of a large number known effective and ineffective sirnas  <cit> . we also propose the combined prediction method of the rbf network and decision tree learning. the effectiveness of the proposed methods were confirmed by using them to evaluate sirna sequences recently reported to effectively or ineffectively suppress the expression of various genes . as the average prediction probabilities of gene silencing for the effective and ineffective sirna sequences of the reported genes by the proposed three methods were respectively 65% and 32%,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and  <dig> %, the methods imply high estimation accuracy for selecting candidate sirna sequences. although the proposed methods are different from the previous scoring methods and are therefore difficult to compare with them, the evaluation results indicate that the proposed methods would be useful for many other genes. they will therefore be useful for selecting sirna sequences for mammalian genes.

RESULTS
we propose two prediction methods for selecting effective sirna sequences from many possible candidate sequences, one based on the supervised learning of rbf and other based on the learning of decision tree.

learning based on the rbf network and the decision tree
a radial basis function  network is a type of artificial network for application to problems of supervised learning, such as regression, classification and time series prediction. as rbf networks are nonparametric models, there is no a priori knowledge about the function that is to be used to fit the training set  <cit> . rbf networks are supervised learning models with a single middle layer of units. they are similar back propagation neural networks but usually faster to train because the rbfs used in the units mean that fewer weight adjustments are needed. also, rbf networks tend to be more resistant to noisy data than back propagation networks. decision tree learning is one of the most widely used and practical methods for inductive inference. a decision tree is a tree in which each branch node represents a choice between a number of alternatives, and each leaf node represents a classification or decision  <cit> .

the proposed algorithms of the rbf network and the decision tree learning for selecting sirna sequences effective are described in methods.

verification of the proposed methods
after carrying out the learnings of the rbf network and decision tree using  <dig> effective and  <dig> ineffective sequences, we obtained eight clustered  listed in table  <dig> and the decision tree diagram shown in figure  <dig>  then we computed the prediction probabilities of gene silencing for recently reported individual effective and ineffective sequences for mg <dig> to mg <dig>  by using the proposed methods. the results are respectively shown in figures  <dig> –  <dig> and figures  <dig> –  <dig>  since there were ups and downs in the predicted probabilities of individual sequences, we calculated the average for them.

prediction analysis by the rbf network
the average prediction probability of gene silencing for the mg <dig> effective sirna sequences was  <dig> % with the standard deviation  <dig> %, whereas the average probability for the ineffective sirna sequences was  <dig> % with the standard deviation  <dig> %. as there is a clear difference between the prediction probabilities of the effective and ineffective sirna sequences, the predicted probabilities correspond to the effectiveness indication of the proposed method. the average prediction probabilities of effective sirna sequences for mg <dig>  mg <dig>  mg <dig> and mg <dig> were respectively 66% ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , whereas the average prediction probabilities of the corresponding ineffective sirna sequences were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . as there are also clear differences between the averages of the effective and ineffective sirna sequences for these genes, the individual predicted probabilities indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

relations between the average prediction probabilities of the effective and ineffective sirna sequences for the recently reported sirnas are shown in figure  <dig>  with regard to gene classes, mg <dig>  mg <dig> and mg <dig> indicate distinctions between the effective and ineffective sirnas more clearly than mg <dig> does and mg <dig> indicates distinctions remarkably clearly. these results therefore imply that there are some differences individual nucleotide frequencies at each position of the sirnas effective for these gene classes. although mg <dig> indicates differences between the effective and ineffective sirnas, the ratios of the effective to ineffective ones are less than 20%. this implies that there is no big difference between the individual nucleotide frequencies of the sirnas effective and ineffective for silencing this class of genes. the entire average of  <dig> effective sequences for these genes was 65% , whereas that of  <dig> ineffective ones was 32% .

prediction analysis by the decision tree learning
we also computed the average prediction probabilities for mg <dig> to mg <dig> by using the decision tree learning. relations between the average prediction probabilities of the effective and ineffective sirna sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  comparing figure  <dig> with figure  <dig>  we can understand the differences between the average prediction probabilities of the rbf and decision tree methods. although the average prediction probability for mg <dig> effective sirna sequences was 53%  by the decision tree learning, the corresponding probability by the rbf network was  <dig> % . this is 13% higher than that of the decision tree learning. there are similar relations among the average prediction probabilities for mg <dig> to mg <dig>  the entire average prediction probability of  <dig> effective sirna sequences for these genes was  <dig> % , whereas that of  <dig> ineffective sirna sequences was  <dig> % . although the method of the rbf network might be superior to that of the decision tree learning, different results imply that two methods have their own prediction criteria.

combined method of the rbf network and decision tree learning
since there were different prediction features in the two methods, we combined both methods to increase prediction capability. that is, if a candidate sequence is predicted as a high prediction probability one in either method, it can be inferred as a high prediction probability one. for example, if some sequence in mg <dig> effective sirnas were predicted as 50% gene silencing by the rbf network and the same sequence were predicted as 65% one by the decision tree learning, it can be considered as 65% gene silencing in the combined method. the average prediction probabilities of gene silencing for various genes by using the combined method are shown in figure  <dig>  it is clear that the combined method indicates better prediction probabilities for mg <dig> to mg <dig> than those by the rbf network and decision tree learning. the average prediction probabilities for the total effective and ineffective sirna sequences are respectively  <dig> %  and  <dig> % .

comparison with other reported methods
the proposed methods use the supervised learning techniques by the rbf network and decision tree for selecting effective sirna candidates, whereas most of the previous methods use scoring techniques  <cit> . although the proposed methods can estimate the probability of gene silencing in the range from  <dig> to  <dig>  the scoring methods cannot indicate this probability. the scoring method basically sets score values for candidate sirna sequences according to the designated design rules. consequently if an sirna candidate for a specific gene completely satisfies the required design rules, it is expected to get a high score. even though a high-potential sirna would be obtained, however, it is difficult to estimate the probability that this sirna would actually accomplish the expected gene degradation. in addition, as the previous scoring methods are dependent on their designated rules, the obtained scores vary depending on the individual rules. it is therefore quite difficult to compare these different scoring methods with the proposed methods.

as the important role of the scoring methods is to show the priority of the sirna candidates, it is necessary to be clear as to score differences between effective and ineffective sirnas. that is, the scores of the effective sirnas should be indicated by a set of high values, whereas those of the ineffective ones should be indicated by a set of low or negative values. from this point of view, we examined scores of the sirnas effective and ineffective for mg <dig> to mg <dig> by using the previously reported scoring methods  <cit> . as a result, it was clear that the previous methods do not always clearly distinguish between effective and ineffective sirna sequences . the methods of reynolds et al. and hsieh et al., for example, show positive scores for sirnas effective and ineffective for mg <dig>  mg <dig>  mg <dig> and mg <dig> and do not yield distinct differences between the scores of effective and ineffective sirnas. the average scores of sirnas for mg <dig> obtained using the method of reynolds et al., for example, are in reverse order: that is, the scores of the ineffective sirnas are larger than those of the effective ones. in addition, although the methods of ui-tei et al. and amarzguioui and prydz provide correspondences between the individual average scores and the sirnas effective and ineffective for mg <dig> to mg <dig>  the relative score differences between the effective and ineffective sirnas are not large . in the case of using the method of ui-tei et al., for example, the average scores of the sirnas effective and ineffective for mg <dig>  mg <dig>  and mg <dig> are respectively  <dig>  and - <dig>   <dig>  and - <dig> , and  <dig>  and  <dig> . these results imply that this method might result in producing many same-score sirna candidates because of the difficulty of setting the candidate priorities.

the proposed method, on the other hand, by estimating the gene silencing probability of the sirna candidates can, as shown in figure  <dig>  clearly indicate differences between effective and ineffective sirnas. this therefore implies that the proposed method can easily be used for selecting high-potential sirna sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed two prediction methods for selecting effective sirna target sequences from many possible candidate sequences by using a radial basis function  network and decision tree learning. they are quite different from the previous score-based sirna design techniques and can predict the probability that a candidate sirna sequence will be effective. the proposed methods were evaluated by applying them to recently reported effective and ineffective sirna sequences for various genes. in addition, we also proposed the combined method of the rbf network and decision tree learning. as the average prediction probabilities of gene silencing for the effective and ineffective sirna sequences of the recently reported genes by the proposed three methods were respectively 65% and 32%,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and  <dig> %, the methods imply high estimation accuracy for selecting candidate sirna sequences. the evaluation results indicated that the proposed methods would be useful for many other genes. it should therefore be useful for selecting sirna sequences for mammalian genes.
