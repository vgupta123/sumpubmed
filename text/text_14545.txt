BACKGROUND
nosocomial infections caused by opportunistic pathogens are one of the most important health problems in developed countries. depending on the geographic location, p. aeruginosa is the first or second causative agent of nosocomial infections  <cit> . p. aeruginosa infects patients suffering from aids, people at intensive care units, and burned people among others, and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis, the most prevalent hereditary disease in caucasian populations  <cit> . a successful infection by this type of pathogens depends on the interplay of multiple factors including the susceptibility of the host, the virulence of the strain and its resistance to antibiotics  <cit> . previous work has shown that the physiological fitness and the virulence of p. aeruginosa and other opportunists are affected by the expression of antibiotic resistance mechanisms such as mdr-pumping systems  <cit> .

the pathogenicity of pseudomonas aeruginosa involves various components operating at different levels. the flagella and pili facilitate contact with the bacterium's cell target and play a role in its adhesion, which is a critical step in the infection  <cit> . after contact, the type iii secretion system is able to inject into the cytoplasm of the target cell a series of cytotoxic molecules that act at various levels. the mechanism of action involves, in many cases, the presence of host cofactors still unidentified  <cit> . other virulence factors involve products secreted into the extracellular medium by systems i and ii such as elastase, alkaline phosphatase and exotoxin a among others. the expression of many of these virulence factors is regulated by a mechanism of bacteria-to-bacteria cell signalling known as quorum-sensing  <cit> . despite the functional and genomic similarity among different p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> , some differences in their pathogenicity have been observed  <cit> . for example, the clinical isolate pa <dig> is more virulent than pao <dig> in a wide range of hosts  <cit> . it has been shown that the genome of pa <dig> contains two pathogenicity islands that are not present in pao <dig> and it has been proposed that the virulence in this organism  is the result of a pool of pathogenicity genes interacting in various combinations in different genetic backgrounds  <cit> . in spite of these suggestions, the cause of the different virulence behavior of pao <dig> and pa <dig> is not yet fully understood.

although most of the work on pathogenesis has been focused on understanding the bacterial factors that render a virulence phenotype, increasing attention is being paid to the host and those aspects connected to the susceptibility or resistance to infection. understanding the host-pathogen relationship, at both the cellular and molecular level, is essential to identify new targets and develop new strategies to fight infection. molecular analysis of host-pathogen interactions would benefit from the use of model systems allowing a systematic study of the factors involved. in this regard the social amoeba d. discoideum has proven particularly useful for its ease of handling, genetic tractability  <cit>  and fully sequenced genome  <cit> .

d. discoideum is a soil microorganism that feeds on bacteria by phagocytosis. the interaction between bacteria and their natural predators  is believed to have shaped both predators  <cit>  and bacterial evolution. as a consequence, some of the mechanisms developed by bacteria to avoid the activity of their natural predators in the environment might have been adapted later in evolution to allow the infection of higher organisms such as humans  <cit> . specifically, it was found that the quorum-sensing mechanisms and type iii secretion, which are essential factors in the infectivity to humans are also responsible for the infectivity of p. aeruginosa in d. discoideum  <cit> .

our previous studies have shown the utility of this model system of infection to analyze the virulence of other opportunistic pathogens like stenotrophomonas maltophilia  <cit> . it has been also demonstrated the validity of d. discoideum as a model of infection by intracellular pathogens such as legionella, cryptococcus and mycobacterium  <cit> . consequently, the conservation of the mechanisms of infection needed to infect mammals and d. discoideum in a wide variety of pathogens reinforces the use of this system as a valid model to study host-pathogen relations. we have used whole-genome d. discoideum microarrays to study global host transcription upon infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig> and pa <dig> to determine whether or not transcription is being affected as a defense mechanism or altered in the benefit of the pathogen.

RESULTS
pseudomonas aeruginosa strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> show a different virulence behavior in d. discoideum
pao <dig> and pa <dig> are two clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa frequently used as model strains to analyze the virulence of this bacterial pathogen. since they behave differently in some aspects dealing with the expression of virulence determinants, we wanted to compare the differential response of the host to these strains. for this purpose, we made use of d. discoideum as a model for virulence. as a first step a plating assay of virulence was set up. figure  <dig> shows a representative experiment of three independent assays in which d. discoideum cells were grown in association with bacteria on nutrient sm plates. klebsiella aerogenes, a non -pathogenic bacteria, was used as an appropriate food supply and p. aeruginosa mixed at the indicated proportions. an effect in the size of the clearing plaques could already be seen when only  <dig> % of p. aeruginosa cells were mixed with  <dig> % of k. aerogenes cells and this effect was even clearer using 17% of p. aeruginosa cells. when the behavior of the strains was analyzed in more detail, it was found that pao <dig> is reproducibly more permissive than pa <dig> as observed by the higher growth of d. discoideum on pao <dig>  the differences in the area of the cleared bacterial lawn between pao <dig> and pa <dig> were measured for the condition corresponding to the  <dig>  % mixture. the average area and the standard deviation were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm <dig> for pao <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm <dig> for pa <dig> . the significance of differences between groups as determined by student's t-test was p < 10- <dig>  to further confirm these results a different plating assay was performed on non-nutrient agar. pao <dig>  pa <dig> and k. aerogenes were previously grown in lb overnight, washed out of the media by centrifugation and deposited with d. discoideum cells in agar plates at the indicated proportions. under these conditions the difference in the virulence between pao <dig> and pa <dig> was even more evident as shown in a representative experiment in figure  <dig>  interestingly pao <dig> is permissive to d. discoideum growth under these non-nutrient conditions. however, pa <dig> still shows a strong virulence against d. discoideum. all together these results suggest that pa <dig> is more virulent than pao <dig> in the d. discoideum model of virulence.

pseudomonas aeruginosa induces a specific gene expression response in dictyostelium
little is known about the interplay between the host and the pathogen in terms of gene expression responses. we wanted to determine if there is a specific gene expression response of d. discoideum to their interaction with p. aeruginosa. d. discoideum cells were exposed to p. aeruginosa strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> mixed with an excess of k. aerogenes in hl <dig> for  <dig> hours. k. aerogenes alone was used as a control to which the gene expression levels were compared. rna was extracted from d. discoideum and used to study the global pattern of gene expression using whole-genome d. discoideum microarrays . using a p <  <dig>  cutoff, there were  <dig> genes whose expression was significantly different between the pao1-treated cells and the controls and  <dig> genes between pa14-treated cells and controls . the heat map shown in figure  <dig> indicates that the responses were broadly comparable between the two strains with very few genes oppositely altered in the two conditions. the differences in the gene expression are approximately in the range between four-fold repression and three-fold induction . these results were validated by real time pcr of the same samples used for the transcriptomic assays, measuring the expression of  <dig> representative genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the different conditions. figure  <dig> shows a good correlation between the data obtained from the microarray transcriptomic experiment as compared with that obtained by quantitative rt-pcr. although the log-ratio changes in the gene expression showed some differences the overall trend were consistent, supporting the reliability of our data.

common and specific responses of d. discoideum to the infection with pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains
as shown in table  <dig> there were  <dig> genes that showed similar differential regulation with both bacterial strains compared with the controls . we have considered in the analysis those genes showing differences in log-ratios that are higher than + <dig>  or lower than - <dig> . interestingly the expression of another group of  <dig> genes  was different depending on whether the infecting strain was pao <dig> or pa <dig>  we have studied in detail both groups by manual annotation and categorizing using the extended categorization for d. discoideum previously described  <cit> . genes of unknown function and those showing weak homologies were not included in the list. table  <dig> contains the genes that were similarly regulated upon infection with any of both strains, and in figure  <dig> the genes are categorized by function . the first interesting conclusion from this experiment is the existence of a common transcriptional response that affects many different genes that are involved in a wide range of functions. the proportion of the genes that were downregulated by the treatment with both strains of p. aeruginosa is higher  compared to those upregulated . this difference is more evident in categories such as stress response and transport .

discussion
p. aeruginosa is able to infect d. discoideum cells using several virulence traits that are similar to those used to infect mammalian cells and other hosts  <cit> . the clinical p. aeruginosa isolates pa <dig> and pao <dig> have been used independently to study the infection of dictyostelium by pseudomonas in two different laboratories  <cit> . however, no direct comparison had been reported so far between these strains in this pathogenicity model. we now report that pa <dig> is indeed more virulent in d. discoideum using different plating assays. since p. aeruginosa is phagocytosed at much lower rate than the non-pathogenic k. aerogenes   <cit> , the assays were designed to provide sufficient food to d. discoideum to avoid cell starvation. thus, k. aerogenes was always used in excess together with the pathogenic strains. in the first assay  a nutrient plate was used to allow the growth of bacteria and d. discoideum simultaneously. under these conditions the presence of pa <dig> inhibits d. discoideum growth to a greater extent than pao <dig>  to avoid differences in the growth rates between bacteria that might alter their final proportions, a non-nutrient assay was performed . in these experiments, d. discoideum feed on bacteria that have been previously grown and deposited at different proportions in non-nutrient agar. interestingly, pao <dig> is not virulent in this condition suggesting that bacterial growth is necessary for the expression of the virulence in this strain. however, even in these conditions pa <dig> is capable of inhibiting d. discoideum growth. some studies have suggested that pa <dig> pathogenicity is multifactorial and required the action of multiple virulence mechanisms  <cit> . these differences between strains prompted us to study the transcriptional profile of d. discoideum upon infection with pao <dig> and pa <dig> to gain insights not only into the possible common transcriptional response but also into any specific response that could explain the observed differences in their virulence. pilot experiments showed that  <dig> hours of exposure of d. discoideum cells to either pseudomonas aeruginosa strains did not result in any apparent cell death or change in cell morphology . since we wanted to study the early transcriptional response we chose this short time of exposure to avoid changes due to cell death. the existence of a rapid gene expression response between 1– <dig> hours upon exposure of d. discoideum cells to legionella, an intracellular pathogen, has also been described  <cit> .

our results show the existence of a common transcriptional response to the infection with p. aeruginoa pao <dig> or pa <dig> that affects  <dig> genes grouped in many different cellular functions. the complexity of the observed transcriptional changes could be the result of the induction of d. discoideum defensive responses or triggered by p. aeruginosa to make a less hostile cell environment that would support a better survival of the pathogen. in this scenario downregulation of genes involved in stress response might be beneficial for a successful infection. interestingly, we have observed a clear down-regulation of genes dedicated to stress in the common response to pao <dig> and pa <dig> but also in the specific response to the more virulent strain pa <dig>  for example the gene coding for strictosidine synthase  which is involved in the synthesis of alkaloids related to defense mechanisms in plants  <cit> , trap <dig>  that plays a central role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation  <cit>  or the genes coding for lysozymes involved in bacterial degradation   <cit> , to mention just a few.

besides stress response other categories are affected by an overall downregulation such as metabolism, translation and transport facilitation. a subcategorization of the genes included in metabolism  showed that all the genes coding for proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism were downregulated in the common response suggesting an effect on cell proliferation. moreover, a number of other downregulated genes are directly involved in cell growth as demonstrated functionally in previous studies. this is the case for example of ddb <dig> , whose disruption leads to reduced growth on bacteria  <cit> , ddb <dig> , which is essential for cell growth as mutants in the gene are not viable in the absence of glutathione  <cit> . ddb <dig>  that is involved in cell proliferation  <cit> , among others that have been annotated in supplementary table  <dig>   <dig> 

two different expression microarray analysis in mammals upon infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa have been reported. in the first report epithelial cells were exposed to the pathogen for  <dig> hours, a short exposure similar to our experimental design. unfortunately the number of genes represented in the array was very limited   <cit> . only  <dig> genes were differentially regulated and we have not found any homologous gene in common. the other work reported the analysis of pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal infection using an oligonucleotide microarray  <cit> . this experiment is not directly comparable to ours since a long exposure to the pathogen  was performed to assure an infection process. as a consequence most of the regulated genes were associated with the immune response and apoptosis, aspects that are not present in dictyostelium.

d. discoideum is also susceptible to the infection by legionella pneumophila, a facultative intracellular parasite, which uses different infective mechanisms from p. aeruginosa. it is important to note here that the transcriptional response of d. discoideum upon infection with legionella  <cit>  was essentially different to the one we report for p. aeruginosa. only  <dig> genes were found to be altered in both experiments . this indicates that the host response is rather specific of the type of infection and the bacterial pathogen involved. nevertheless, some responses can be also common. for instance, ddb <dig>  whose expression is downregulated in pao <dig> and pa <dig>  plays an important role in legionella infection since the null mutant has increased sensitivity to the infection  <cit> . nramp <dig> transports metal cations out of the phagolysosome in an atp-dependent process. this activity is believed to be necessary to avoid the growth of intracellular pathogens and might also contribute to the efficient killing of other bacterial pathogens.

the variety of genes whose expression is altered by p. aeruginosa infection suggests a complex scenario in which a combined downregulation of the expression of some of the mentioned genes might affect d. discoideum fitness thus favoring the infection. the precise role of these genes in the pathogenesis and the mechanisms that regulates their expression will promote further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that p. aeruginosa pa <dig> is more virulent than pao <dig> in the d. discoideum model using different plating assays. the transcriptional responses of d. discoideum infected by either p. aeruginosa pao <dig> or pa <dig> were analyzed by whole-genome microarrays and the expression of  <dig> genes changed similarly upon infection with any of both strains as compared with the control. effects on metabolism, signaling, stress response and cell cycle can be inferred from the genes affected. interestingly there were  <dig> genes differentially regulated between pao <dig> and pa <dig>  and this differential response might contribute to the different virulence behavior displayed by these two model strains. this is a starting point to begin to understand the complex relationships between environmental opportunistic pathogens and their natural hosts. besides, our data support the idea that the host responses to different isolates of the same bacterial pathogen are largely different, thus indicating that the crosstalk between the pathogen and its host is more specific and more complex than previously thought.
