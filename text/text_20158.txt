BACKGROUND
apple  is one of the most important fruit crops worldwide, and low temperature is one of the major environmental factors affecting apple productivity in some commercial apple-growing regions. apple trees require sufficient chilling during the winter period to resume normal growth and to develop their fruiting buds in the spring  <cit> . however, early spring chilling and late spring frosts that occur when growth has already resumed may damage apple trees  <cit> . thus, improved tolerance to chilling may significantly increase apple production and economic benefit.

plant responses to low temperatures are manifested at the physiological, molecular and biochemical levels  <cit> . at the molecular level, low temperatures induce a specific set of genes and proteins that mediate plant tolerance to cold stress. in response to cold temperatures, these genes and their products are involved in the protection of cellular machinery from stress-induced damage .

the ice1-cbf-cor cold response pathway is one of the primary cold signaling modules that triggers the cold tolerance response in arabidopsis . arabidopsis cor  genes encode proteins that help protect against freezing stress  <cit> . the promoters of many of these cor genes contain copies of the c-repeat/dehydration-responsive element  . a family of ap <dig> domain-containing transcriptional activators, known as either cbf   <cit>  or dreb  proteins  <cit> , bind to the crt/dre element and activate transcription. the genes encoding cbf transcription factors are also induced by cold, and the three cbf genes in arabidopsis encoding dreb1b/cbf <dig>  dreb1a/cbf <dig> and dreb1c/cbf <dig> have been found to participate in the cold-acclimation pathway  <cit> . overexpression of the dreb1a/cbf <dig> and dreb1b/cbf <dig> genes in arabidopsis increases the cold tolerance of transgenic plants  <cit> . enhanced cold tolerance has also been observed in transgenic tobacco, tomato and rice expressing cbf genes  <cit> . in apple, overexpression of the mbdreb <dig> transcription factor gene increases plant tolerance to abiotic stress  <cit> . additionally, heterologous overexpression of the prunus persica cbf <dig> gene in apple enhanced freezing tolerance compared to the control m. <dig> plants  <cit> .

the bhlh transcription factors are ubiquitously involved in the response of higher plants to various abiotic stresses, including cold , drought  and high salinity . ice <dig>  is a myc-like basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that activates cbf <dig> and cor genes in response to low temperatures in arabidopsis  <cit> . ice <dig> binds to the myc recognition cis-elements  in the promoters of cbf <dig> gene, which triggers the expression of the cbf family members and subsequently enhances the expression of the cbf regulon  <cit> . a dominant mutation in ice <dig> blocks the cold induction of cbf <dig> and reduces the expression of downstream genes  <cit> . over-expression of ice <dig> has been associated with enhanced chilling tolerance in arabidopsis, cucumber and rice  <cit> . the degradation of the ice <dig> protein strongly affects the expression of the genes encoding cbf3/dreb1a and cbf1/dreb1b along with the cold tolerance response  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the degradation of ice <dig> during acclimation to low temperatures is mediated by polyubiquitination at 26s proteasome pathway  <cit> . the ice <dig> protein involved in cold acclimation is also modified by sumo conjugation/deconjugation  <cit> .

in this study, the bhlh gene mdcibhlh <dig>  was cloned based on its differential expression in response to cold stress. the specific binding of the protein encoded by mdcibhlh <dig> to the promoters of cbf genes was verified with emsa  and chip-pcr . subsequently, mdcibhlh <dig> was transformed into arabidopsis, apple and tobacco to characterize its functions in the cold response. the findings of this study indicate that the mdcibhlh <dig> gene may be used to improve cold tolerance in apple and other crop species.

RESULTS
gene cloning, sequence analysis and mdcibhlh <dig> subcellular localization
within the publicly available apple genbank , there are a large number of ests exhibiting high similarity to arabidopsis bhlh tf  from blast searches. differential expression analysis was conducted with semi-quantitative rt-pcr to identify bhlh ests associated with cold induction in apple, and a differentially expressed est was isolated using this methodology . subsequently, the full-length cdna was cloned using the race technique following est-based in silico cloning. hereafter, the gene is referred to as mdcibhlh <dig> .

sequence analysis showed that three introns were present in the open reading frame  of mdcibhlh <dig> along with four exons of the following lengths:  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp . the mdcibhlh <dig> orf was found to be  <dig> bp in length and to encode a predicted protein containing  <dig> amino acid residues with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kd.

the mega  <dig>  program was used to construct phylogenetic trees for the bhlh proteins. for this analysis, all arabidopsis bhlh proteins and mdcibhlh <dig> were included and aligned. the mdcibhlh <dig> protein clustered within the same clade as atbhlh <dig>  and atbhlh <dig>  . in addition, genomic comparisons revealed that the mdcibhlh <dig>  atice <dig> and atice <dig> genes all contained four exons, indicating a similar genomic composition .

the predicted mdcibhlh <dig> protein was found to contain a conserved bhlh domain and a nuclear localization signal http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/subloc/. the bhlh domain of mdcibhlh <dig> exhibited high similarity to the bhlh domains of ice proteins in other plant species .

the presumed nuclear localization signal in mdcibhlh <dig> was sufficient to direct a gfp fusion protein to the nucleus. the subcellular localization of mdcibhlh <dig> was investigated by introducing a translational fusion between mdcibhlh <dig> and gfp into onion epidermal cells using agrobacterium-mediated transformation. cells expressing the mdcibhlh1:gfp fusion gene showed gfp fluorescence only in the nucleus , while cells expressing gfp alone showed gfp fluorescence throughout the entire cell . this result suggests that the mdcibhlh <dig> protein subcellularly localizes to the nucleus.

expression of mdcibhlh <dig> in different tissues and in response to cold stress
mdcibhlh <dig> transcript levels were analyzed in different tissues by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. the results showed that mdcibhlh <dig> transcripts were constitutively present at different levels in the various tissues tested, including the spring shoot, dormant bud, floral bud, flower, young leaf, mature leaf, young fruit, fruit skin and callus . to determine whether mdcibhlh <dig> is induced by cold stress, its expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr in apple tissue cultures exposed to 4°c for different amounts of time. the results showed that mdcibhlh <dig> expression was positively induced by the chilling treatment at 4°c .

in arabidopsis, atcbfs are crucial components acting downstream of atice <dig> in the cold signaling pathway . in the apple genome, there are five cbf genes: mdcbf <dig> , mdcbf <dig> , mdcbf <dig> , mdcbf <dig>  and mdcbf <dig> . phylogenetic analysis indicated that the five mdcbfs are highly similar to cbfs in other plant species, including grapevine, poplar, tomato, arabidopsis and rice . interestingly, the expression of all five mdcbfs was positively induced by chilling treatment at 4°c following the increased expression of mdcibhlh <dig> , suggesting that mdcibhlh <dig> may act upstream of the mdcbfs.

mdcibhlh <dig> regulates atcbfs by binding to their promoters in arabidopsis
the similarity of mdcibhlh <dig> to atice <dig> and atice <dig> indicates that it may function in a similar way to the atice proteins. to examine if the mdcibhlh <dig> protein binds to myc recognition sites associated with cold signaling, as atice <dig> does, emsa was conducted to assess the dna-binding capacity of mdcibhlh <dig> to four canntg motifs, myc <dig>  myc <dig>  myc <dig> and myc <dig>  in the atcbf <dig> promoter  <cit> . shifted bands were observed for myc <dig> . when 100-fold and 400-fold excess of non-labeled competitor dna probe for myc <dig> was added to the reaction, the presence of shifted bands was reduced . in contrast, a mutated competitor had less of an effect on the binding between mdcibhlh <dig> and the myc <dig> fragment, compared to the wild-type competitor . therefore, the excess quantity of the non-labeled probe interfered with the specific binding of the labeled myc <dig> promoter fragment. the non-specific competitor did not have this effect, indicating that the mdcibhlh <dig> protein specifically binds to the myc <dig> recognition site in the atcbf <dig> promoter.

band shifts were also observed for the reactions between mdcibhlh <dig> and the myc <dig>  myc <dig> and myc <dig> probes . however, the binding was not abolished by the addition of unlabeled wild-type myc <dig>  myc <dig> and myc <dig> competitor, respectively , indicating that the binding of mdcibhlh <dig> to myc <dig>  myc <dig> and myc <dig> was not as specific as the binding to myc <dig>  this is not the case for atice <dig>  which specifically binds to all four recognition sites  <cit> .

to further characterize the functions of the mdcibhlh <dig> gene, a construct containing mdcibhlh <dig> driven by the camv 35s promoter was genetically transformed into arabidopsis. three homozygous transgenic lines, l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  were used for further investigation. semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed higher levels of mdcibhlh <dig> transcripts in the three lines than in the wt  control. in addition, the expression of atcbfs increased remarkably in the  <dig> transgenic lines compared to the control . transgenic seedlings were used to examine chilling tolerance. relative root lengths were measured after the chilling treatment. the results showed that at 20°c the ectopic expression of mdcibhlh <dig> inhibited the root growth of the transgenic arabidiopsis seedlings . in contrast, at 4°c the relative root lengths of l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> transgenic seedlings were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while that of wt control was  <dig>  . therefore, heterologous expression of mdcibhlh <dig> conferred enhanced chilling tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis seedlings.

mdcibhlh <dig> regulates cold tolerance via the cbf pathway in apple
emsa was used to verify the specific binding of mdcibhlh <dig> to the myc sequence in the atcbf <dig> promoter. the promoters of the five mdcbfs also contain myc recognition sites, and chip-pcr was conducted to determine whether mdcibhlh <dig> protein binds to the promoters of the five cbf genes in apple. an mdcibhlh1-gfp fusion construct driven by the camv 35s promoter was introduced into apple tissue cultures and calluses using agrobacterium-mediated transformation. chip assays were performed using gfp antibodies. the chip product of transgenic callus transformed with an empty vector was used as a nonspecific control. after isolation of cross-linked chromatin, immunoprecipitated dna was analyzed by pcr . the results showed that mdcibhlh <dig> specifically bound to the mdcbf <dig> promoter at three regions . however, it failed to bind to the regions tested in the mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig> and mdcbf <dig> promoters. the specific binding of mdcibhlh <dig> to the mdcbf <dig> promoter was also observed in transgenic apple calluses .

for the functional characterization of mdcibhlh <dig> in apple callus, the transgenic callus line expressing the mdcibhlh <dig> gene was referred to as the tgc  line, and the transgenic callus line containing the empty vector pbin was referred to as the pbin control. semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed higher transcript levels of mdcibhlh <dig> in the tgc line than in the pbin control, suggesting that the mdcibhlh <dig> gene was overexpressed in the tgc line. in addition, the expression of mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig> and mdcbf <dig> was upregulated in the tgc line compared to the pbin control , further suggesting that mdcibhlh <dig> functions upstream of the mdcbfs and upregulates their expression in part by directly binding to the mdcbf <dig> promoter. these results indicate that mdcibhlh <dig> overexpression conferred enhanced chilling tolerance in the tgc line .

the function of mdcibhlh <dig> was also characterized in transgenic apple tissue cultures. semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed high transcript levels of mdcibhlh <dig> in  <dig> transgenic lines, l <dig> and l <dig>  indicating that the mdcibhlh <dig> gene was overexpressed in these transgenic lines. in addition, mdcibhlh <dig> was found to upregulate the expression of mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig>  mdcbf <dig> and mdcbf <dig> , further confirming that mdcibhlh <dig> works upstream of the mdcbfs. wt and mdcibhlh <dig> transgenic lines grown on ms media were exposed to 0°c temperature for  <dig> days. following a 7-day recovery, the wt control was nearly dead, while the  <dig> transgenic lines were still alive . mdcibhlh <dig> overexpression therefore improved the tolerance to cold stress in transgenic apple lines.

overexpression of mdcibhlh <dig> in tobacco
to examine the function of mdcibhlh <dig> in another crop, transgenic tobacco plants heterologously expressing the mdcibhlh <dig> gene were obtained. semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed that the mdcibhlh <dig> gene was heterologously expressed in three transgenic tobacco lines, l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  at different levels . fifteen-day-old seedlings were used to examine tolerance to chilling stress. after maintaining the seedlings at 4°c for  <dig> days, their survival rate was determined. the results showed that the survival ratios of l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> seedlings were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig> ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively, while that of the wt control was  <dig>  ± 2% . in addition, the three transgenic lines produced much more protectant proline but exhibited reduced injury, as indicated by the reduced mda content and electrolyte leakage under chilling conditions compared to wt . heterologous mdcibhlh <dig> expression therefore conferred enhanced chilling tolerance to transgenic tobacco plants. fifteen-day-old seedlings were also used to assess freezing tolerance. the results showed that ectopic expression of mdcibhlh <dig> noticeably enhanced the freezing tolerance of l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> seedlings . the survival ratios of the three transgenic lines were positively correlated with the expression levels of mdcibhlh <dig>  indicating that their enhanced tolerance was derived from the ectopic expression of mdcibhlh <dig> 

adult plants were also used to assess chilling stress tolerance. the results showed that l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to chilling compared to wt plants . after 4°c treatment for  <dig> h, wt plants started to wilt, while transgenic plants were near normal in appearance. following a 2-h recovery under normal conditions, wt plants showed necrosis at the leaf margin, while the three transgenic lines completely recovered . in addition, transgenic plants produced much less mda than wt plants and therefore had less injury in their membrane systems, as indicated by the reduced electrolyte leakage relative to the wt control under chilling stress .

taken together, these data indicate that mdcibhlh <dig> is involved in chilling tolerance in various plant species.

mdcibhlh <dig> protein is modified by ubiquitination and sumoylation
to determine the stability of the mdcibhlh1-gfp fusion protein under cold stress, immunoblots were conducted using transgenic apple calluses. the results showed that mdcibhlh <dig> protein gradually degraded to very low levels upon exposure to cold stress for  <dig> h. however, mg <dig>  a 26s proteasome-specific protease inhibitor, remarkably suppressed the cold-induced protein degradation , suggesting that the ubiquitination-associated proteasome is involved in this process. therefore, in addition to cold-induced transcription, cold temperatures may also affect mdcibhlh <dig> activity by modulating its protein abundance at a posttranslational level.

it has been reported that atice <dig> protein degrades at low temperatures through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> . in addition, sumoylation may function as a ubiquitin antagonist  <cit> . to determine if mdcibhlh <dig> protein is modified by ubiquitination or sumoylation, mdcibhlh1-gfp protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-gfp antibody in the tgc line . the precipitated proteins were detected with anti-ubiquitin and anti-sumo antibodies to determine the occurrence of ubiquitination and sumoylation modifications, respectively. positive signals were detected for both antibodies , suggesting that ubiquitination and sumoylation of the mdcibhlh <dig> protein occur in vivo in tgc calluses.

discussion
in this study, the mdcibhlh <dig> gene was isolated from apple, based on its differential expression in response to cold treatment. it encodes a bhlh tf. the bhlh tfs represent a family of proteins that contain a conserved bhlh domain, a motif involved in dna binding  <cit> . the bhlh proteins regulate downstream genes through sequence-specific interactions at the promoter regions of these genes  <cit> . mdcibhlh <dig> was found to have a highly similar gene structure and amino acid sequence to arabidopsis ice <dig> and ice <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that it is a putative apple ortholog of the ice proteins. this is consistent with the fact that mdcibhlh <dig> expression was induced by cold stress, as observed for ice <dig> and ice <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, mdcibhlh <dig> was found to have a longer sequence than atice <dig> and atice <dig>  corresponding to the greater genome size of apple compared to arabidopsis.

in arabidopsis, ice <dig> acts directly upstream of the cbfs by binding to the myc recognition sites present in the promoters of the cbf genes, and this binding subsequently triggers the expression of the cbfs/drebs regulon  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atice <dig> and atice <dig> may directly regulate atcbf <dig> and atcbf <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in this study, mdcibhlh <dig> protein was found to bind to the myc recognition site of the atcbf <dig> and mdcbf <dig> promoters using emsa and chip-pcr, further confirming that it functions similarly to ice proteins. however, mdcibhlh <dig> specifically bound to only one of the four putative myc recognition sites in the promoter of atcbf <dig>  while atice <dig> binds to all  <dig> myc sites. in apple, however, mdcibhlh <dig> only bound to the mdcbf <dig> promoter. in accordance with the specific binding, the greatest increase in expression was observed for mdcbf <dig>  but the expression of the other  <dig> mdcbf genes was also enhanced. this may be explained by either an incomplete conservation between mdcibhlh <dig> and the atices or the existence of other recognition sites in the promoters of the mdcbf genes. additionally, mdcbf <dig> may regulate the expression of other mdcbf genes, as is the case for the atcbfs in arabidopsis  <cit> .

the cbf cold responsive pathway is an important low-temperature gene network that contributes to cold tolerance . dreb1b/cbf <dig>  dreb1a/cbf <dig> and dreb1c/cbf <dig> are induced by cold in arabidopsis. overexpression of the dreb1a/cbf <dig> and dreb1b/cbf <dig> genes increases cold tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis, rapeseed, tobacco, tomato and rice  <cit> . in addition, the genes encoding cbf/dreb transcriptional activators are also associated with increased cold tolerance in apple  <cit> .

a dominant mutation in ice <dig> blocks the cold induction of the cbf <dig> regulon and impairs freezing and chilling tolerance  <cit> . in contrast, ice <dig> overexpression increases cold tolerance relative to wild-type plants not only in arabidopsis but also in other plants such as cucumber and rice  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a recently identified positive regulator, ice <dig>  which is a bhlh transcription factor, participates in the response to freezing through the cold acclimation-dependent pathway  <cit> . in this study, mdcibhlh <dig> overexpression resulted in elevated expression of the cbf genes and enhanced tolerance to cold stress. these data suggest that mdcibhlh <dig> acts as a signal transduction component in the cbf pathway and is associated with cold tolerance in apple, as is the case for the ice genes in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, cold induces atice <dig> proteolysis through a proteasome pathway  <cit> . it has been shown that the ubiquitination of atice <dig> is mediated by hos <dig> both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . in addition, atsiz1-mediated sumo conjugation/deconjugation of atice <dig> is a critical process required for low temperature tolerance  <cit> . unlike atice <dig>  atice <dig> is not involved in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis  <cit> . the results of the present study showed that the mdcibhlh <dig> protein was degraded under cold conditions and that mdcibhlh <dig> was modified through the ubiquitination and sumoylation pathways. however, the mdcibhlh <dig> protein did not interact with athos <dig> or atsiz <dig> . our results suggest that the degradation of mdcibhlh <dig> protein depends on the presence of other ubiquitin and sumo e <dig> ligases in apple.

the cbf pathway is also operational in trees  <cit> . it is well established that early spring chilling and late spring frosts that occur when growth has already resumed may cause damage to apple crops by direct chilling injury or by indirectly influencing pollination and fruit set efficiency  <cit> . the expression of mdcibhlh <dig> was positively induced by cold treatment, suggesting that the mdcibhlh <dig> gene may be involved in the protection of apple tissues from cold injury.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we isolated an apple bhlh  gene mdcibhlh <dig> . its expression was noticeably induced in response to cold stress. it encodes an ice-like protein. the degradation of the mdcibhlh <dig> protein was induced by cold treatment and was potentially mediated by ubiquitination and sumoylation in apple. furthermore, emsa and chip-pcr verified that the mdcibhlh <dig> protein specifically bound to the myc recognition sequences in the promoters of atcbf <dig> and mdcbf <dig> genes. as a result, the ectopic expression of mdcibhlh <dig> enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis, tobacco and apple seedlings or plants by upregulating the expression of cbfs genes through the cbf  pathway. therefore, mdcibhlh <dig> functions in cold tolerance in a cbf-dependent way in different plant species. reflecting its role in cold tolerance, mdcibhlh <dig> may be an appropriate gene for overcoming cold stress and improving apple crop productivity under cold temperature conditions.
