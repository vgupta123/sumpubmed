BACKGROUND
the purification of natively folded protein from heterologous expression systems is cumbersome and in some cases impossible because of the formation of insoluble protein aggregates called inclusion bodies  <cit> . factorial screens of expression conditions or refolding assays can yield soluble proteins in some cases and can increase yield in most cases but many proteins remain resistant  <cit> . affinity purification under denaturing conditions followed by renaturation can yield natively folded protein and is a viable alternative.

anfinsen first demonstrated the reversible denaturation of proteins in solutions of urea in the 1960ies  <cit> . it has since been the method of choice to denature native proteins and also aberrant protein aggregates. the denaturation of proteins by urea yields protein in a random coil state, i.e. no secondary structure elements are favoured over any other conformation  <cit> . the interactions of sds with proteins have been intensively studied since the 1940ies  <cit> . denaturation of polypeptides by sds is a multi-step process that starts with the interaction of the negatively charged sulphate group with oppositely charged, basic, amino acid side chains  <cit> . the hydrophobic tails of sds molecules then become buried in the hydrophobic core of proteins and start to disrupt the native structure  <cit> . finally a large fraction of the polypeptide chain, independent of its conformation in the native state, adopts an alpha-helical conformation and is surrounded by a micelle of sds molecules  <cit> . the length of this mixed protein-detergent micelle is roughly proportional to the molecular weight of the polypeptide  <cit> .

thus the denaturation of polypeptides by urea and sds are different at the mechanistic level and yield two different results: a random-coil structure in urea and a largely alpha-helical conformation in sds  <cit> .

hexahistidine-tagged proteins can be purified under denaturing conditions using chaotropic concentrations of urea or guanidinium hydrochloride  <cit> . the high-affinity binding of the hexahistidine tag to ni/nta resin is based on the co-operative co-ordination of a nickel cation by two histidine side chains  <cit> . it is independent of the peptide conformation but requires close physical proximity .

we wondered whether the histidine side chains of an sds denatured protein, which are buried inside a mixed detegent-protein micelle, would be accessible for binding to ni/nta and whether thus detergent denatured proteins could be purfied by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography .

plasmid construction
expression constructs and their inserts are detailed in table  <dig>  cdna was made from 0– <dig> hour old drosophila melanogaster embryos or from drosophila kc cells. expression constructs were generated by blunt-end pcr amplification from cdna using phusion polymerase. amplified pcr fragments were cloned into pet151/d-topo to generate expression constructs that express a 6xhis-v5-tev tagged fusion protein. all inserts were confirmed to be in-frame and full length by sequencing.

all constructs are based on pet151/d-topo. this vector contains a 6xhis-v <dig> epitope - tev cleavage sequence tag of approximately  <dig> kda. the molecular weights given are those of the entire fusion protein, i.e. containing the tag.

overexpression in e. coli
expression constructs were heat-shock transformed ino bl  <dig>  star cells, plated on lb plates containing carbenicillin  and incubated o/n at 37°c. the next day several colonies were collected and used to inoculate  <dig> ml cultures of lb medium containing carbenicillin. the cultures were grown at 37°c until the od  <dig> was  <dig>  and then induced by addition of iptg to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm. cultures were then grown over night at 30°c.

buffered solutions
pcl  contained  <dig> mm na2hpo <dig>   <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  mm kh2po <dig>   <dig>  mm kcl and 1% sds  at ph  <dig> . pcw  contained  <dig> mm na2hpo <dig>   <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  mm kh2po <dig>   <dig>  mm kcl and  <dig> % sarkosyl  at ph  <dig> . pce  contained  <dig> mm na2hpo <dig>   <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  mm kh2po <dig>   <dig>  mm kcl,  <dig> mm imidazole and  <dig> % sarkosyl  at ph  <dig> .

purification
the cultures were harvested in gs <dig> rotor tubes by centrifugation at 4°c for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> rpm. the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> ml pcl buffer, supplemented with dtt to  <dig> mm, and sonicated with a bandelin sonoplus hd <dig> sonicator, set to 80% cycle and 40% power using a ms <dig> probe-tip . samples were sonicated at room temperature twice for  <dig> minutes each. the lysates were transferred to ss <dig> tubes and placed in an ice-water mixture and incubated for  <dig> minutes. the chilled lysates were then centrifuged in a ss <dig> rotor at  <dig> krpm for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. the cleared supernatant was poured off and filtered through a  <dig>  μm syringe filter before applying it to affinity purification. ni/nta affinity purification was performed on an akta xpress fplc system using  <dig> ml histrap hp columns and standard purification templates . columns were equilibrated with pcw buffer, the lysate loaded and the columns washed until the absorption of post-column flowthrough returned to base levels. bound proteins were eluted with a  <dig> ml linear gradient of buffers pcl and pce, from  <dig> to 50% buffer pce, i.e. from  <dig> to  <dig> mm imidazole in  <dig> column volumes. weakly bound contaminating proteins typically eluted at  <dig> mm imidazole, the peak maximum of hexahistidine tagged proteins was between  <dig> and  <dig> mm imidazole.

samples were taken at various points  and loaded on sds-page gels according to the total volume of the fraction to make samples comparable. sds page was performed on 12% 17-well gels according to the manufacturers recommendations. see figure  <dig> for a coomassie stained sds-page gel of one representative sample . see figure  <dig> for samples of the final eluted fractions for all  <dig> proteins.

RESULTS
figures  <dig> and  <dig> present the purification of seventeen different fusion proteins of sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, detailed in table  <dig>  these proteins were previously shown to be insoluble after lysis of induced cells in standard native lysis buffers . they are domains of proteins involved in the drosophila insulin and tor kinase signaling network and represent various non-homologous structures  <cit> . the purification of one of these protein domains, the rem domain of rictor, encoded by construct  <dig>  is shown in detail in figure  <dig>  for the other sixteen proteins only the final, purified protein, is shown in figure  <dig> 

the hexahistidine-tagged proteins were overexpressed in e. coli using standard procedures . after harvest the cells were resuspended and sonicated in a buffer containing high concentrations of sds . proteins that aggregated in inclusion bodies were rapidly dissolved by sonication . the lysates were then cooled to precipitate free sds. the sds pellet contained only small amounts of protein . after centrifugation the supernatant contained both host proteins and overexpressed target protein . thus proteins do not co-precipitate with sds when the lysate is chilled. the lysates were then subjected to purification as detailed in materials and methods. the combined flow-through and wash fraction contained only minimal amounts of unbound fusion protein . the elution profile shows three consecutive peaks eluting at ± <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm imidazole . table  <dig> summarizes the purification procedure.

key steps in the procedure are described and their purpose briefly explained. the comments are based on the experiments described herein and additional purifications using the same principle but with slightly different protocols .

discussion
we wanted to test whether hexahistidine-tagged proteins can be imac-purified after sds denaturation. in our first experiments we included  <dig> mm  of sds in all buffers, i.e. in the lysis, wash and elution buffers commonly used for affinity purification. cell pellets were rapidly lysed by sonication and binding to ni/nta resin occurred, however most of the hexahistidine-fusion protein was found in the flow-through, indicating poor binding . upon searching the literature we realized that there was no primary literature concerning the binding of hexahistidine-tagged proteins to ni/nta in solutions containing sds. one manufacturer of ni/nta resins publishes a handbook that indicates that no more than  <dig> % sds should be included in the buffers  <cit>  but these are empirical values that are not based on published experiments .

in  <dig> suzuki and terada published that sds can be selectively removed from solutions containing bsa by cooling  <cit> . we hypothesized that the same principle might be applied to whole cell lysates and that it should yield a solution with lower concentrations of sds that would be compatible with high affinity binding to ni/nta. we modified the buffer compositions such that only the buffer used for initial lysis contained high concentrations of sds  and included a low concentration of sarkosyl  in the wash and elution buffers. after lysis by sonication the lysate was cooled in an ice/water bath for  <dig> minutes and precipitated sds removed by centrifugation. the residual concentration of sds was compatible with high affinity binding to ni/nta. we applied this purification protocol to seventeen different proteins  and consistently achieved high-affinity binding and elution profiles that indicated sensitivity to imidazole concentration, i.e. contaminating proteins eluted at lower imidazole concentrations than the tagged target protein.

we would like to mention that we did not specifically test whether the dodecylsulphate anion  of sds precipitates as the sodium salt  or with another monovalent cation such as potassium , which is also present in the buffer  <cit> .

detergents display complex phase diagrams in aqueous solutions  <cit> . many detergents separate into a distinct phase when temperature or salt concentrations change. a landmark paper showed that integral membrane proteins remain in the detergent phase after temperature induced phase separation of triton x- <dig> and that therefore phase separation can be used as a tool in protein purification  <cit> . nowadays phase separation of detergents, sometimes called “cloud point extraction”, is frequently used to purify membrane proteins  <cit> .

we would like to point out that our method is similar to cloud point extraction only in as far as the detergent is used to initially solubilize the proteins of interest, in our case from inclusion bodies, and that phase separation is induced experimentally. however, it critically differs from cloud point extraction in that the proteins do not co-partition into the detergent phase after phase separation. instead the surplus of unbound detergent is removed from the solution to allow subsequent affinity purification.

curiously as early as in  <dig> it was shown that sds can be selectively removed from solutions containing proteins by cold precipitation with barium chloride  <cit> . suzuki and terada showed that sds can be removed from solutions containing bsa by cooling  <cit> , however, we are not aware of a publication that would combine this principle with the dissolution and denaturation of inclusion bodies and subsequent imac.

the buffer components used in this method are compatible with automated chromatography and allow high throughput purification of target proteins on a suitable purification platform. one key advantage over purification in urea or guanidinium is that sds can be used at comparably low concentrations  and does not tend to crystallize in valves and pumps of fplc chromatographs  <cit> .

finally, we wish to add that protocols for the refolding of proteins from a detergent denatured state are known. one relies on replacing sds with urea and subsequent removal of urea  <cit> . the other is based on cyclodextrine mediated stripping of detergent molecules from the protein  <cit> . we therefore think our method can be of application in the purification and refolding of recalcitrant proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
ionic, denaturing detergents are useful reagents in the solubilization and purification of proteins from inclusion bodies and can be used to replace the more commonly used reagent urea.
