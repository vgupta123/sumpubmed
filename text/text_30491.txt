BACKGROUND
carotenoids are widely found in plant species and are responsible for the coloration of flowers and fruits to attract pollinators and seed-dispersing animals  <cit> . carotenoids are essential components of human diets, and they have important roles in human health as antioxidants, vitamin a precursors and cancer-preventing effectors  <cit> .

more than  <dig> naturally occurring carotenoids have been identified  <cit> . of them, some carotenoids and their biosynthesis are well characterized; for example, α-carotene and β-carotene serve as important source of vitamin a  <cit> ; and high levels of β-carotene accumulation in cauliflower was mediated by an or gene  <cit> . however, the majority of carotenoids, including lycopene, their biosynthesis and regulation are poorly understood. lycopene provides the familiar red color to tomato fruits, and is the most potent antioxidant among carotenoids  <cit> . interest in lycopene metabolism and regulation is growing rapidly because of the overwhelming reports on the role of lycopene in human health promotion, such as the prevention of a range of chronic diseases particularly the prostate cancer  <cit> . it has been shown in tomato fruit, the accumulation of lycopene is highly correlated with up-regulation of carotenogenic genes in the upstream of lycopene and down-regulation of lycopene cyclases in the downstream  <cit> . biochemical and molecular studies in tomato mutants with different carotenoids accumulation have provided more in-depth insight into lycopene biosynthesis. one type is yellow-fruited tomato mutants with reduced lycopene content where two possibilities have been reported: one possibility is due to reduced expression of carotenogenic genes in the upstream of lycopene including yellow-flesh mutant due to dysfunction in phytoene synthase   <cit> , and tangerine mutant with a deletion mutation in carotenoid isomerase gene   <cit> ; the other possibility is due to up-regulation of lycopene downstream genes such as delta mutant with increased expression of lycopene epsilon-cyclase gene   <cit> . for other types of mutants characterized with increased lycopene, the underlying mechanisms are more complicated. ronen et al.  analyzed an old-gold  mutant and found that lycopene accumulation is due to null mutation in the gene lycopene β-cyclase   <cit> . three other mutants, named as high pigment , are well-known for the accumulation of higher concentrations of lycopene in the fruit. cloning of hp- <dig> gene showed that it encodes uv-damaged dna binding protein   <cit> ; hp- <dig> gene also encoded a light signaling regulator deetiolated <dig>   <cit> ; whereas hp- <dig> mutation occurred in zeaxanthin epoxidase  gene, and caused abscisic acid deficiency  <cit> . collectively, physiological, genetic and molecular studies of the mutants indicated that lycopene metabolism and regulation is complicated in tomato; however, in species other than tomato, there is limited information available on the mechanism of lycopene accumulation in fruits.

sweet orange  is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. sweet orange fruit is rich in carotenoids, and is reported with more than  <dig> species of carotenoids  <cit> . carotenoid composition and content in sweet orange fruits have been extensively studied, and shown that lycopene is absent from common varieties  <cit> . so far, three sweet orange mutants with lycopene accumulation in the fruits were reported: shara  <cit> , cara cara  <cit>  and the recently reported 'hong anliu'  <cit> . most of the researches were on cara cara, including the analyses of carotenoid composition and content  <cit> , and expression of the main carotenoid biosynthetic genes  <cit> . alquezar et al.  found that the altered carotenoid composition in cara cara may conduct to a positive feedback regulatory mechanism of carotenoid biosynthesis during fruit development and maturation; and not only carotenogenic genes but also the isoprenoid genes were altered transcriptionally in the mutant. the other red-flesh mutant 'hong anliu' was discovered in china as a bud mutation of 'anliu' sweet orange; and we found that lycopene in this mutant is 1000-fold higher than that in comparable wild type fruits, and in juice sacs the lycopene accumulation was coincided with increased expression of upstream carotenogenic genes and reduced expression of downstream genes. interestingly, this bud mutation also caused high sugar and low acid in the mutant fruits  <cit> . molecular evaluation on dna level using ssr with  <dig> primers and a number of aflp markers produced no polymorphism between them, indicating an isogenic background between them . thereafter, we used suppression subtraction hybridization  combined with cdna microarray technique to investigate the molecular basis of the bud mutation. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were detected  <cit> . interestingly, 95% of the  <dig> genes showed differential expression at  <dig> days after flower , indicating that the  <dig> daf is a critical stage for the transcriptional regulation of the mutant trait formation . taken together, our previous research by ssh technology has provided important clues for understanding the formation of mutation trait in 'hong anliu', however, the transcriptional information from ssh, especially for the gene expressed in low levels, are rather limited. further researches of the global transcriptional analyses are needed.

massively parallel signature sequencing technology  is a sequence-based method recently developed that can be used for measuring gene expression  <cit> . the mpss method is "global" in that it can identify a nearly complete inventory of transcripts in a given sample. for plant species that lack whole genome sequence information such as citrus, mpss can provide a broader view of the transcriptome than microarray analyses which includes known sequences  <cit> . the mpss method has been used for various transcriptional studies in plants  <cit> . two interesting cases in arabidopsis mutant-wildtype pairs have suggested that mpss method is robust in identifying mutation responsive genes  <cit> .

in this study, a genome-wide gene expression study was carried out between the red-flesh mutant 'hong anliu' and its wild type 'anliu' sweet orange using mpss method, a total of  <dig>  genes were analyzed, of which  <dig>  genes in sense and  <dig> genes in antisense showed a two-fold or greater expression difference between the mutant and wild type, and  <dig> genes in sense and  <dig> genes in antisense are differentially expressed at  <dig> % significance level. the results demonstrated that some genes are newly transcribed in the mutant. our results also provided a large number of genes previously not known to be involved in the mutation trait formation. interpretation of the data built up links between new information herein and our previous fragmentary knowledge, and provided new insight into the molecular processes regulating lycopene accumulation in the mutant fruits.

RESULTS
mpss signature abundance and distribution
mpss libraries were constructed using rna extracted from sweet orange fruit pulps at  <dig> daf stage for wild type  'anliu' sweet orange and its red-flesh mutant  'hong anliu'. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> successful sequences were produced for wt and mt, respectively. the sequence sets were filtered to remove low quality sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides, adaptor sequence and below  <dig> transcripts per million  in both libraries, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> reliable signatures for wt and  <dig> , <dig> reliable signatures for mt . from the reliable signature sets,  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct signatures were observed for wt and mt, respectively . correlation efficient of the mpss data between wt and mt revealed high repeatability with r =  <dig> . the saturation evaluations showed that with the increase of total sequence number , the number of new distinct signature decreased markedly; and particularly the new distinct signature with frequency > <dig> decreased to  <dig> when the total sequences reached  <dig> million . this indicated that the library size is saturated and contained enough signature information for gene expression analyses.

the distribution of signature abundance was quite similar between mt and wt . three signatures in mt and four signatures in wt were expressed at high abundance more than 1% . while with the decrease of abundance, the number of signatures increased dramatically. 60% of the total signatures in mt and 56% of the total signatures in wt were at abundance less than  <dig> %. moreover, about 99% of the total signatures in both libraries was below  <dig> % abundance , suggesting that genes with low transcripts are abundant in both libraries.

differential expression of mpss signatures between mutant and wild type
the frequency of signature was regarded as relative expression level of each transcript in mt and wt libraries. comparative analyses of the frequency of signature between mt and wt revealed that the expression ratio  varied greatly from  <dig>  to  <dig>  of the common signatures in both libraries,  <dig>  signatures showed a two-fold or greater  expression difference between mt and wt , and are regarded as differentially expressed transcripts according to the criteria defined by meyers et al.   <cit> .

signature frequency was also compared statistically between the two libraries using z-score method according to kal et al.   <cit> , which use p-value as statistical significance level. this method revealed that  <dig>  signatures were significantly different at p <  <dig> , at the same time their expression ratio were greater than  <dig> or less than  <dig>  . of these  <dig>  signatures,  <dig>  were significant at p <  <dig>  with their expression ratio > <dig> or < <dig> .

identification of mutation-responsive genes
to link the signatures to known genes from sweet orange, a unigene dataset comprised  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons was used for mpss signature mapping analyses. all the sequences were used to produce in silico signatures in both sense and antisense directions. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in silico signatures were identified in sense and antisense respectively. the produced in silico signatures stored in the reference signature database, through which the expressed mpss signatures were mapped on the corresponding est contigs and singletons based on matches between mpss signatures and in silico signatures. the results showed that a total of  <dig>  genes  are expressed in mt ; and  <dig>  genes  are expressed in wt .

the expression level of each gene in mt and wt was measured by the normalized number of the frequency of mpss signature  to look for genes showing significant changes between the two samples. a general picture of the gene expression was plotted for the mt versus that of wt . a total of  <dig>  genes in sense and  <dig> genes in antisense showed a two-fold or greater  expression difference between mt and wt. based on z-score statistical analyses at  <dig> % significance level,  <dig> genes in sense and  <dig> genes in antisense were up- and down-regulated ; and all these  <dig> differentially expressed genes showed a significant induction or repression by more three-fold. the significantly differential expressed genes can be directly linked to carotenoid biosynthesis ; or consistent with our recently published microarray data ; or in line with our proteomic data ; but most of them were newly observed in this study, such as aba responsive genes , gibberellin related genes , terpenoid biosynthesis related genes. moreover, a number of transcription factors including myb and nac were observed .

functional classification of mutation-responsive genes
to evaluate the potential functions of genes that showed significant transcriptional changes between the mt and wt, gene ontology  categories were assigned to the significant  <dig> genes using annot8r program. the categorization of mutation-responsive genes according to the cellular component, molecular function, and biological process are shown in figure  <dig>  based on molecular function, the genes were finally classified into  <dig> categories, as shown in figure 4b; the most over-represented go terms  concerned with protein binding, transporter activity, nadh catalytic activity, ubiquitin-related activity, protelysis activity and transcription regulator. categories based on biological processes revealed that the mutation responsive genes were related to  <dig> biological processes, including transport, response to stress, regulation, ubiquitination, steroid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis and tca cycle and etc . moreover, go representations from this study were compared with that based on all the unigenes from sweet orange in tigr gene index database  <cit> ; the results revealed that the striking differences lies in the high percentage of plastid and chloroplast for cellular component, and overpresentation of photosynthesis, citrate cycle and ubiquitination for biological process in this study.

the biological interpretation of the significant mutation responsive genes was further completed using kegg pathway analyses. a total of  <dig> different metabolic pathways were found with more than  <dig> genes affiliated, of which some were consistent with biological processes already revealed by go analyses. the most represented pathways were listed in table  <dig>  of these, some were related with mutation trait formation based on previous knowledge, including carotenoid biosynthesis , citrate cycle , diterpenoid biosysnthesis , fatty acid metabolism , glycolysis , oxidative phosphorylation , photosynthesis , pyruvate metabolism , starch and sucrose metabolism , steroids biosynthesis , and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis .

verification of the mutant trait formation related genes
transcriptional regulation revealed by mpss data was confirmed in a biologically independent experiment using quantitative rt-pcr. a total of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes and one gene of no differential expression, were chosen to design gene-specific primers . the transcript abundance patterns of the mt and wt were compared with mpss data. results showed that for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, qrt-pcr revealed the same expression tendency as the mpss data, despite some quantitative differences in expression level. figure  <dig> showed  <dig> genes  expression levels between mt and wt. for example, the photosynthesis-related gene tc <dig> showed  <dig>  times up-regulation in mt than in wt as analyzed by qrt-pcr, consistent with mpss data that the gene expression in mt was  <dig> -folds higher than the wt. furthermore, the expression profile of five genes including myb transcription factor, capsanthin synthase , and three other newly detected genes with significant transcriptional changes  were analyzed at five stages during fruit development between the mutant and wild type . as expected, the ccs gene is down-regulated in mt at  <dig> daf stage, indicated that partial impairment of lycopene downstream flux can be caused by down-regulation of ccs gene. it is noticeable that the expression level of the myb gene in mt is  <dig>  fold higher than that in wt, correlating well with the mpss data showing  <dig>  fold expression difference at  <dig> daf stage.

measurement of chlorophyll content and photosynthesis activity
the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis activity were measured in leaves of three different trees each for wt and mt. measurement of chlorophyll content did not reveal significant difference between wt and mt, though the total chlorophyll content in mt is slightly higher than that in wt . the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were measured at  <dig> time points of the day. results showed that the stomatal conductance in mt is higher than that in wt at all the stages, with significant difference at 11: <dig> am in the morning . the highest photosynthetic rate was measured at 9: <dig> am in the morning, and the difference between wt and mt was significant at all the  <dig> time points except at 17: <dig> pm in the afternoon . all this physiological data revealed that photosynthesis, as one of the important biological processes, was enhanced in the mt.

disscussion
mpss, like expressed sequence tags  and serial analyses of gene expression , is a tag-based method recently developed that can be used for quantitative measurements of gene expression when combined with genomic sequence or unigene dataset  <cit> . comparing with ests and sage technologies, mpss has its advantages that it can provide a more thorough and scientific representation of the absolute transcript population, and is more sensitive to genes expressed at low levels due to deep sequencing with the resultant dataset containing more than  <dig> million tags for each sample in this study . when compare with cdna microarray technology that requires previous knowledge of genes, the limitations to detect unknown genes was not encountered in mpss  <cit> . another difference between mpss and microarray is that statistical analyses in microarray is based on biological replicates; while statistical analyses of mpss is usually based on enough sequences with more than  <dig> million tags in a given sample  <cit> . the mpss technology has become popular in transcriptional expression studies  <cit> . from the results of this study, it is easy to notice that mpss analyses not only highlight some genes and biological processes already revealed by our microarray and proteomic data, but also reveal large amount of genes which are possibly involved in the formation of mutation trait. the data consistency from multiple approaches assures that the mpss data produced in this study is reliable.

identification of key genes and metabolism pathways involved in the formation of lycopene accumulation trait in the sweet orange mutant
in this study, we used mpss method to monitor the global transcriptional changes in the mt comparing with wt, and identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes at  <dig> % significance level that were induced or repressed by more than three fold in the mutant. a number of new genes possibly related with lycopene accumulation were found in this study. functional category analyses revealed that a number of important pathways may work collaboratively in shaping the red-flesh trait in the mutant .

the first noticeable pathway is the isoprenoid and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways which exist in plastid. four differential genes are involved in the carotenoid metabolism pathway, including tc <dig> gene , tc <dig> gene , and two different abscisic acid hydroxylases , encoded by tc <dig> and tc <dig> genes . the transcription level of lycb gene detected by mpss in mutant was  <dig> times lower than that in wild type, consistent with our previous data by qrt-pcr  <cit> . the lycb was believed to be a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of lycopene to cyclic carotenes  <cit> . the ccs gene is also significantly down-regulated in the mutant at  <dig> daf . the ccs is an enzyme with a similar action mechanism to lycb; and low transcript level of ccs is possibly responsible for the accumulation of lycopene in red grapefruits   <cit> . based on these data, it can be speculated that the down-regulation of lycopene downstream genes lycb and ccs, in combination with up-regulation of lycopene upstream genes , will result in the accumulation of lycopene in the sweet orange mutant. it is interesting that the biosynthesis of abcisic acid  was affected in the mutant. two genes involved in aba biosynthesis were down-regulated, fitting well with our observation that aba content in mt is lower than that in wt . the decreased biosynthesis of aba in mt is plausible due to the decreased supply of aba precursor, xanthoxin, which is downstream of lycopene and could be significantly affected by down regulation of lycb gene. this could also be evidenced from another sweet orange mutant 'cara cara' with high lycopene accumulation that the pulp of the mutant at color-breaker stage only contained 23% of the aba content of its normal counterpart  <cit> . a recent study in tomato hp <dig> mutant also showed that aba is deficient in the mutant with higher lycopene content  <cit> .

the second group of significant mutation-responsive pathways includes photosynthesis, glycolysis, citrate cycle  and fatty acid metabolism. pathways in this group showed a complicated pattern. for photosynthesis,  <dig> genes were involved as revealed from go and kegg analyses; all these genes exhibited up-regulation pattern in mt fruits . the induction of genes associated with photosynthesis is consistent with the go results that large number of genes are located in chloroplast; and is in line with our gas chromatographic analyses that the sugars in juice sacs is higher in mt than in wt  <cit> . moreover, our in situ analysis of the photosynthetic rate confirmed that photosynthesis in mt is stronger than that in wt . another case in tomato hp- <dig> mutant which manifested with increased carotenoids, primarily lycopene, showed that genes involved in photosynthesis are consistently up-regulated throughout fruit ripening  <cit> ; and by contrast sugar deficiency delayed lycopene accumulation in tomato  <cit> . all these findings suggest the importance role of photosynthesis and sugar in the accumulation of lycopene. similar to photosynthesis, genes involved in glycolysis showed an up-regulated pattern. the glycolysis provides substrates pyruvate for the methylerythritol phosphate  pathway. meanwhile, our data showed three important genes participated in mep pathway  were also up-regulated . therefore, the increased mep biosynthesis led to the enhanced biosynthesis of carotenoids, and meanwhile resulted in the dramatical increment of lycopene due to the partial impairment of downstream flux caused by down-regulation of lycb and ccs gene as discussed in the previous paragraph . this provides a molecular scenario for the formation of lycopene accumulation trait in the mutant red-flesh fruits. in the other metabolic flux of pyruvate which happens in cytosol, acetyl-coa is produced for the mevalonic acid  pathway. and the two branch flux of acetyl-coa were inhibited. one is the tca cycle; three genes, isocitrate dehydrogenase , malate dehydrogenase , and importin alpha- <dig> gene , were down-regulated. these mpss data correlate well with our previous data that the citric acid in the mutant is significantly lower  than that in wild type  <cit> . the other branch downstream of acetyl-coa is fatty acid metabolism; all the genes involved in this pathway were down-regulated.

the third group of metabolite pathways is downstream of mva pathway. this group is relatively simple. two genes involved in the ubiquinone biosynthesis were up-regulated. six genes related to sterol biosynthesis and two to brassionsteroids biosynthesis also showed an up-regulated pattern in the mutant.

when our results on red-flesh orange mutant is compare with that on tomato mutants with abnormal accumulation of lycopene, the molecular mechanism for lycopene accumulation is different. for example, lycopene accumulation in tomato old-gold mutant is due to null mutation in lycb gene  <cit> ; and high-pigment  <dig> mutant is due to mutation on zep gene  <cit> ; while tomato high-pigment  <dig> and high-pigment  <dig> mutation happened on light responsive genes  <cit> . in this study, by using a pleiotropic mutant with high sugar, low acid and abnormal accumulation of lycopene, extensive molecular pathways including isoprenoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in the mutant, and enhanced photosynthesis and the partial impairment of lycopene downstream flux caused by down-regulation of lycb and ccs genes are critical for the formation of lycopene accumulation trait in the sweet orange mutant.

the transcriptional regulation of carotenoid metabolism in sweet orange mutant
the alternation of carotenoid composition and concentration can be achieved through biosynthesis and post-biosynthesis activities including transport, storage and degradation  <cit> . these activities could be regulated on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. in our study, high percentage of antisense transcripts, i.e.  <dig>  of  <dig>  genes in mt and  <dig>  of  <dig>  genes in wt, were observed, possibly indicating post-transcriptional regulations existed in sweet orange fruit development. in contrast, the mpss data provided much more information for the regulation of these activities on transcription level.

a noticeable result is that considerable amount of genes,  <dig> % of the total annotated genes, were involved in regulation of biological process or transcription . the induction of regulatory genes of transcription correlates well with the increased overall transcription in mt. the total number of transcribed genes in the mutant was  <dig> , more than that in wild type  <dig> , suggesting that newly initiated transcription occurs in the mutant. moreover, analyses of the genes with transcription changes >  <dig> fold showed that up-regulated genes constitute  <dig> % of the total changed genes. it is noticeable that myb gene, a transcription factor , showed a significant transcription changes in the mutant as revealed by mpss data. and qrt-pcr analysis confirmed that the differential expression of myb gene was significant at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daf stages, suggesting that myb gene functions in extensive stages during fruit development. myb genes are a superfamily of transcription factors that control many biological processes; and have also been highlighted for their regulation in pigment accumulation, primarily in anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . while, to the author's knowledge, it is still unknown whether myb genes are regulating carotenoid biosynthesis; so this study provided an important gene that possibly regulate lycopene accumulation in the orange fruits.

genes possibly involved in the post-biosynthesis activities were also highlighted with significant transcriptional changes. an impressive category is transporter gene, which constitutes  <dig> % of the total annotated genes. one gene ey <dig> shows high homology with sugar transporter gene , suggesting that sugar translocation is active in  <dig> daf stage. this is consistent with the above mentioned result that photosynthesis are active, and thus the produced sugar has to be transported to juice sac through phloem in citrus  <cit> . our physiological data also showed that the stage  <dig> daf is also the most important stage for sugar accumulation . another remarkable group possibly involved in post-biosynthesis activities is ubiquitination or proteolysis related genes. twelve genes were categorized into ubiquitin mediated proteolysis , indicating that protein degradation may play important role in maintaining certain important gene at a constant steady-state level, as proposed by welsch et al.  who found a ring finger protein involved in degradation processes and is a stable element in the carotenogenesis of arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . in this study, the ring-finger gene  was mainly expressed in mature stages of the fruits, possibly indicating that ring finger gene has a similar function as a stable element in carotenogenesis during orange fruit development.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a global picture of the gene expression changes in a sweet orange red-flesh mutant comparing with wild type. the interpretation of the mpss data uncovered a large number of genes which were previously not known to be involved in the mutation trait formation. functional categorization of the differentially expressed genes showed that a number of important pathways, including isoprenoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, citrate cycle  and some post-biosynthesis activities such as transporter and degradation, cross communicated and worked collaboratively in shaping the red-flesh trait of the mutant. this study provided new insight that enhanced photosynthesis and the partial impairment of lycopene downstream flux caused by down-regulation of lycb and ccs genes are critical for the formation of lycopene accumulation trait in sweet orange fruits.
