BACKGROUND
in insects, sex pheromones, together with visual and acoustic clues, play a large role in the courtship behaviour preceding mating  <cit> . in drosophila, pheromones are long-chain hydrocarbons which appear to be synthesized in large epidermal cells called oenocytes and deposited on the cuticle  <cit> . they have been widely studied and their biosynthesis is partly known: fatty acid precursors are desaturated by acyl-coa-desaturases and elongated to give very long chain fatty acids, which are eventually decarboxylated to give hydrocarbons  <cit> . among the drosophila melanogaster hydrocarbons, only unsaturated ones have been shown to have a behavioral role: principally monoenes, unsaturated in position  <dig> in males and dienes unsaturated in positions  <dig> and  <dig> in females. the main pheromones are 7-tricosene  and 7-pentacosene  in males, and  <dig> -heptacosadiene  and  <dig> -nonacosadiene  in females. some other hydrocarbons with one unsaturation, 7-pentacosene and 7-heptacosene , can also elicit – at a lower level – courtship behavior  <cit> .

in the biosynthesis of pheromones, two desaturases can perform unsaturations: desat <dig> enzyme catalyzes the conversion of palmitic and stearic acids into palmitoleic and oleic acids, which serve as substrates for the synthesis of various lipids and also of 7-unsaturated hydrocarbons  <cit> . desat <dig> gene is expressed in both males and females in a number of tissues, including fat body, which is the main site of production of fatty acids, and oenocytes, which is the site of production of hydrocarbons and is involved in hydrocarbon metabolism  <cit> . female fly mutants for desat <dig> have fewer pheromones and are less attractive to wild-type males, leading to increased courtship latency  <cit> . in desat <dig> mutants, lipid metabolism is also severely impaired, and characterized by a dramatic decrease in both saturated and unsaturated fatty acid production  <cit> . the second enzyme is desatf, which introduces a second double bond in the fatty acid precursors. the gene, only expressed in females, seems specifically expressed in oenocytes; a line knocked-down for desatf has been generated in the laboratory. the expression of desatf rnai in fat body alone had no effect; the same expression induced in both oenocytes and fat body led to a large decrease in female pheromone production and also to less courtship from wild-type males  <cit> .

as desat <dig> pleiotropic effects could be due to its expression in different tissues, we wanted to dissociate the effects of desat <dig> in oenocytes from those in fat body. we wondered whether oenocytes could – alone – account for the synthesis of unsaturated hydrocarbons. therefore, we used one gal <dig> driver targeting expression in the oenocytes without affecting the fat body. overexpression of desat <dig> in oenocytes resulted in a small increase in unsaturated hydrocarbons. with this same driver, flies knocked-down for desat <dig> showed a dramatic loss of all the unsaturated hydrocarbons. we quantified desat <dig> transcripts in the oenocytes by the comparison of the numbers of transcripts in flies expressing or knocked-down for desat <dig> in oenocytes. we also studied male courtship behavior toward the desat <dig> knocked-down females. we compared these effects with the effects of desatf rnai expressed in the oenocytes. desatf knock-down in females led to a large increase in monoenes at the expense of dienes, which were almost completely eliminated. we studied the effect of these desatf knocked-down females on wild-male courtship behavior and quantified the number of desatf transcripts. results show that wild-type male behavior toward desat <dig> and desatf rnai females was very different. the role of unsaturated hydrocarbons on male courtship behavior is discussed.

RESULTS
effect of desat <dig> overexpression on hydrocarbons
hydrocarbons from flies overexpressing desat <dig> under the control of 1407-gal <dig> resulted in a small but significant increase in unsaturated hydrocarbons , at the expense of saturated hydrocarbons . in females, total diene and pheromone  levels were particularly enhanced ; in males, the pheromone level  was increased from  <dig> to 12%, depending on the line .

effect of desat <dig> knock-down on hydrocarbons 
when 1407-gal <dig> driver was used to target desat1rnai, no lethality occurred and flies seemed unaffected in their behavior . however, their hydrocarbon profiles were dramatically affected, with an almost complete disappearance of unsaturated hydrocarbons . the level of saturated linear hydrocarbons was multiplied by  <dig> in both sexes. in females, total dienes  were decreased by 90%, monoenes by 40%.

effect of desatf knock-down on hydrocarbons 
the rnai silencing of desatf expression in females under 1407-gal <dig> driver resulted in an increase  in linear saturated hydrocarbons; the amount of dienes and pheromones was decreased by 98%, that of monoenes was doubled.

courtship behavior
the percentages of wild-type males performing courtship toward the two types of females  were similar, but courtship latency was  <dig> times higher when the female was desat1rnai . males attempting copulation and males succeeding in copulation were fewer  and times required for these behaviours were increased . the total copulation attempts were also decreased  when males were in the presence of desat1rnai females.

the courtship parameters were less affected when males were put with desatfrnai females: there were only 12% fewer copulation attempts and 15% less copulation, respectively. courtship, the first copulation attempt and copulation latencies were increased by 65%, 115% and 55%, respectively.

quantification of transcripts
the number of desat <dig> transcripts was  <dig>  times higher in females than in males . after rnai expression under 1407-gal <dig>  the number of transcripts was halved in both sexes. the number of desat <dig> transcripts in gal4-expressing cells was therefore estimated at  <dig>  and  <dig>  attomoles/μg total rna in males and females, respectively.

the number of desatf transcripts represents only 10% of the number of desat <dig> transcripts; all desatf transcripts are located in the female oenocytes.

the values represent the means of  <dig> determinations ± sem of samples from separate experiments and are given in attomoles/μg total rna.

the desatf transcripts could be detected only in 1407-gal4/+ females, and their number was evaluated at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  attomoles/μg total rna in 1407-gal4/+ females.

discussion
results show that knock-down of desaturase genes in oenocytes is sufficient to suppress or at least largely inhibit pheromone biosynthesis. the effect is particularly clear in males, where desat <dig> knock-down under 1407-gal <dig> led to a 96% decrease in monoenic hydrocarbons. in females, the decrease is less dramatic . the biosynthesis of the saturated hydrocarbons was enhanced, as a consequence of the lack of desaturation of fatty acid precursors. decreased levels of unsaturated hydrocarbons and increased levels of saturated ones have previously been described in p-desat <dig> mutant and resulting excision lines  <cit> . however, the effects on hydrocarbons were relatively smaller, ranging from a  <dig> to about a 66% decrease in unsaturated hydrocarbons, depending on the lines. the fact that we never obtained an almost complete loss of hydrocarbons with desat <dig> mutants in former studies may be due to the pleiotropic nature of the mutation, which affects both fat body and hydrocarbons and also to the hypomorphic state of the mutant desat <dig> alleles  <cit> . the strongest mutant phenotypes  were leaner and poorly viable , with a two-fold loss of fat in the adults  <cit> .

by contrast, desat <dig> knocked-down flies under 1407-gal <dig> driver were perfectly viable and showed no difference from the control ones . the present results obtained with desat <dig> rnai expressed mainly in the oenocytes imply that most of the biosynthesis of pheromones must be made de novo in the oenocytes. a transport of fatty acids and hydrocarbons by a transporter, the lipophorin, has been described, and radio-labelled fatty acid applied topically can serve as precursors for hydrocarbon synthesis  <cit> . lipophorin is essential for selective lipid transport and energy production  <cit> . it also delivers hydrocarbons and sex pheromones from the oenocytes to the cuticular surface and could also play an important role in delivering hydrocarbons to specific tissues such as ovaries, the digestive tract and fat body  <cit> . the transport of fatty acids to the oenocytes does occur but seems relatively low: it has been estimated at about 2–4%, by comparing radioactivity found in crude extracts  <dig> or  <dig> days after topical application to that found in hydrocarbons  <cit>  and may account for the low levels of pheromone biosynthesis remaining in desat <dig> rnai flies.

for desatf rnai flies, similar results have been described with another driver that targets expression in both oenocytes and fat body: the disappearance of dienes, which are replaced by monoenes of lower molecular weight  <cit> . this phenotype is due to the action of elof, a female-specific elongase, which has been shown to elongate fatty acids to very long fatty acids   <cit> . this elongase is highly active in elongating dienic fatty acid precursors, and can also elongate monoenes, but with less efficiency. this would explain the particular profile of desatf rnai females, very similar to that of males, with high levels of 7-t and 7-p, but with some other monoenes of a higher size, such as 7-heptacosene . the main interest of the present study is to confirm that desatf expression is restricted to the oenocytes, and to compare the courtship of wild-type males toward both rnai knocked-down females in the same conditions.

overexpression of desat <dig> in oenocytes led to about a 10% and 25% increase in pheromones in males and females, respectively. the use of three independent lines gave similar results. these figures are relatively small, compared to the 57% increase in female pheromones resulting from the overexpression of desatf  <cit> . this moderate effect of desat <dig> overexpression could be due to a large expression of desat <dig> in oenocytes, which is already sufficient for a whole synthesis of hydrocarbons. approximately half of the desat <dig> transcripts occur in the oenocytes. this figure is high, even if it may be overestimated, due to a faint expression of 1407-gal <dig> in tissues such as the gut, besides a large expression in oenocytes  <cit> . it must also be remembered that desat <dig> is a pleiotropic gene, and its function in oenocytes is not limited to the synthesis of hydrocarbons, but also of other lipids, of fatty acids of the membranes, etc. on the other hand, desatf, which is specifically expressed in oenocytes, seems to be used only for pheromone production, as it is not expressed in species which have no dienic hydrocarbons  <cit> . the number of desatf transcripts is only 11% of the number of desat <dig> transcripts in oenocytes, and might be the limiting factor to a full synthesis of dienes. in fact, all the studies on the control of drosophila female pheromones have shown an action of hormones  or neurotransmitters  on the second desaturation step  <cit> . desatf, unlike desat <dig>  seems very sensitive to hormonal conditions and appears to be the gene in which the regulation of female pheromones is exerted.

another desaturase gene, desat <dig>  has been evidenced in some african strain females that produce  <dig> -hd in place of  <dig> -hd  <cit> . this gene is responsible for the unsaturation of fatty acid precursors in position  <dig> and resembles the desatf gene, in that it seems to be used only for the production of  <dig> -hd pheromones. a recent quantification of desat <dig> transcripts in these  <dig> -hd females estimated a similar number of transcripts as for desatf   <cit> .

the role of unsaturated hydrocarbons on courtship behavior in d. melanogaster has been widely studied. the involvement of unsaturated hydrocarbons with  <dig> ±  <dig> carbons has been described  <cit> , and the threshold action of the  <dig> -hd has been evaluated as near the nanogram level  <cit> . in a previous study with a desat <dig> mutant, the four-fold decrease in both 7-monoenes and  <dig> -dienes in females was accompanied by a 50% increase in courtship latency  <cit> . in the present study the effect of desat <dig> knock-down is followed by a 78% decrease in 7-monoenes , but also a 90% decrease in  <dig> -dienes and a four-fold increase in courtship latency. the longer delay to courtship for desat <dig> rnai females, compared to the mutant ones, can thus be inferred from the lack of  <dig> -dienes.

knock-down of desatf gene in flies resulted in the disappearance of desatf transcripts, while only 2% of pheromones remained, and the levels of 7-p and 7-t were multiplied by two and three, respectively. these flies elicited the same courtship as wild-type females. thus, monoenic hydrocarbons, such as 7-p and 7-h, can replace  <dig> -dienes for courtship latency. however some parameters, such as copulation attempts and copulation latency, were much affected. in a previous study, similar results were obtained, using a more ubiquitous driver, with an effect only on copulation attempts and copulation latency  <cit> . these results tend to show that these two latter courtship parameters are affected by the presence of dienes.

desat <dig> is a gene which is essential for the fly, contrary to desatf. when desatf is knocked-down, larger amounts of monoenes are synthesized. some of these monoenes, especially 7-heptacosene, have been shown to play a role in courtship  <cit> . when desat <dig> is knocked-down, only saturated hydrocarbons can be synthesized and none of these hydrocarbons have been shown to play a role in courtship. actually, desat <dig> has a larger influence on pheromones and courtship, but, in wild-type flies, its expression level does not seem to vary much ; at the opposite, wild-type flies exhibit different amounts of pheromones  and desatf seems very sensitive to environmental and hormonal changes .

CONCLUSIONS
d. melanogaster and d. simulans diverged only  <dig>  million years ago  <cit> . both species differ by their cuticular hydrocarbons, the second species being sexually monomorphic, with large amounts of 7-t and 7-p in males and females  <cit> . both species also share the same ecological niche  <cit> . the gene desatf is present in d. simulans genome, but not transcribed  <cit> . in a previous paper, the rapid evolution of desatf promoter has been evidenced and the importance of desatf in speciation suggested  <cit> . the present study shows that a knock-out of desatf in d. melanogaster has dramatic effects on  <dig> -dienes, but that these effects may be partially counter-balanced by the large increases in 7-monoenes at the courtship-behavior level. one might suppose that evolution first inactivated desatf in d. simulans ancestors, permitting – almost – normal courtship behavior and reproduction, followed by other modifications at the reception level. these studies should bring about better understanding of how speciation has occurred in the drosophila subgroup.
