BACKGROUND
inflammatory immune responses are induced in the immune privileged central nervous system  by aging and neurodegenerative diseases, but cns cells and molecular mechanisms that regulate innate immunity are poorly defined. one prominent and early inflammatory cytokine present in aged and diseased tissue is il-1β that may contribute to secondary cell death. despite the central function attributed to the immune system in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, the initiating signaling pathways that ultimately lead to the activation of the cns innate immune system are unclear.

the inflammatory cytokine il-1β is normally produced and stored in the cytosol as inactive pro-il-β that is rapidly cleaved by caspase- <dig>  which then elicits inflammation after being released from the cell. a number of host-derived molecules that alert the innate immune system to cell injury and tissue damage activate the inflammasome  <cit> . these molecules called "danger-associated molecular patterns" include atp  <cit>  and high extracellular potassium  <cit> . our recent work has shown that the nlrp <dig> inflammasome in neurons plays a crucial role in the innate cns immune response induced by injury  <cit> , but whether the nlrp <dig> inflammasome contributes to inflammatory cytokine production and cognitive impairment due to aging remains largely undefined.

amplified and prolonged inflammatory responses in the aged brain have been reported to promote cognitive and behavioral impairments  <cit> , and clinical studies of elderly patients with infections reveal increases in the occurrence of delirium  <cit> . moreover, elderly patients with prolonged infections are also prone to an increased probability of developing dementia  <cit>  and increased mortality rate  <cit> . thus, the prolonged, amplified production of inflammatory molecules may underlie a heightened neuroinflammatory response in the aged brain leading to cognitive impairments.

in the present study, we found that the nlrp <dig> inflammasome is involved in age-induced activation of caspase- <dig>  and the release of mature il-1β and il- <dig> in the hippocampus. moreover, aging induced increased expression and altered cellular distribution of critical components of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome in hippocampal neurons. these changes corresponded to age-related cognitive deficits in spatial learning. treatment with probenecid, an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for gout, reduced nlrp <dig> inflammasome activation and improved spatial learning performance in aged rats. thus, it appears that heightened nlrp <dig> inflammasome activity is induced by the natural aging process resulting in increased inflammatory cytokine production and cognitive impairment that can be attenuated by inhibition of inflammasome activation.

RESULTS
aged animals perform poorly on a hippocampal-dependent spatial learning task
to assess age-related deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning, young and aged rats were tested in a 3-day spatial acquisition task via morris water maze . mean ) values were determined for each testing day on latency to platform  and for testing day  <dig> for mean path length  for days  <dig> and  <dig>  young rats located the hidden platform with lower latencies  than aged rats  . additionally, mean path-length for young rats  was significantly shorter than for aged rats  on day  <dig> of testing. aged rats are consistently impaired in learning the location of the escape platform  <cit> . therefore, our results were similar to previous findings that aged rats demonstrate spatial learning impairment compared to young rats.

aging increases hippocampal expression of nlrp <dig> inflammasome components in the hippocampus
the nlrp <dig> inflammasome in neurons constitutes a multiprotein complex consisting of caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  apoptosis-associated-speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain , nlrp <dig>  p2x <dig>  pannexin- <dig> and xiap  <cit> . upon inflammasome activation caspase- <dig> is cleaved into active fragments that process pro-il-1β and pro-il- <dig> into active il-1β and il- <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether aging alters expression of nlrp <dig> inflammasome components, protein lysates of young and aged hippocampi were analyzed for levels of inflammatory caspases and key inflammasome proteins . hippocampal lysates from aged animals contained significantly higher levels of cleaved fragments of caspase- <dig> , caspase- <dig> , and xiap , and increased levels of the p2x <dig> receptor  and pannexin- <dig>  than lysates from young rats. levels of nlrp <dig> and asc were not altered in the aged animals. thus, aging stimulates the expression of some of the key components of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome in the hippocampus, suggesting an involvement of the inflammasome in the aging process.

aging induces alterations in expression patterns of pannexin- <dig> and the purinergic receptor p2x <dig> in the hippocampus
in our previous work, we showed that the pore-forming protein pannexin- <dig> can transport extracellular nlrp <dig> stimuli into the cytoplasm of neurons and astrocytes after p2x <dig> receptors bind atp  <cit> , suggesting that k+ ion influx through pannexin- <dig> pores may initiate activation of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome. to establish whether aging induces changes in the pattern of expression of caspase- <dig>  pannexin- <dig> and the p2x <dig> receptor, hippocampi from young  and aged rats  were examined by confocal microscopy. brain sections underwent immunohistochemical procedures followed by confocal microscopy. images indicate that aging results in altered staining patterns of inflammasome proteins in the hippocampus . in young rats, caspase- <dig> immunoreactivity  was present in neun positive nuclei  in a diffuse expression pattern, while intense caspase- <dig> staining was seen in hippocampal neurons of aged rats located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. the increased intensity of caspase- <dig> staining was consistent across aged animals. a more striking alteration was observed in the immunostaining of pannexin- <dig> and p2x <dig> receptors. in aged rats, immunoreactivity of both inflammasome proteins was markedly enhanced, and intense patchy staining was seen in the neuronal soma near or associated with the plasma membrane . the intensity of this patchy staining was greater in the apical portion of the hippocampal neuronal membrane  than in the basal portion. the staining patterns of aged animals were more variable than young animals. however, the appearance of intense patches of pannexin- <dig> and p2x <dig> receptors was present in the hippocampus of all six aged animals analyzed. labeling patterns were similar throughout the hippocampus for young and aged rats. these results demonstrate that aging induces dramatic alterations in the expression patterns of caspase- <dig>  pannexin- <dig> and p2x <dig> receptors in hippocampal neurons.

probenecid treatment attenuates age-related elevation in nlrp <dig> inflammasome components
probenecid was previously shown to block inflammasome activity, specifically by inhibiting pannexin  <dig>  <cit> . here we show a significant decrease in cleaved caspase- <dig> , p2x <dig> receptor , and pannexin <dig>  protein expression in the hippocampus following probenecid treatment in aged rats consistent with lower protein levels of il-1β and il- <dig>  treatment with probenecid also improved spatial learning performance in aged rats. probenecid treated aged rats demonstrated lower latency to platform  and mean path length  than vehicle-treated age-matched controls. these results demonstrate that treatment with probenecid reduces age-related increases in nlrp <dig> inflammasome activation in the aged hippocampus and ameliorates age-related cognitive deficits.

discussion
in this study we have shown for the first time an age-related heightened activation of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome system associated with increased inflammation and cognitive impairment in the hippocampus of aged rats. our data show that aging promotes nlrp <dig> inflammasome activity resulting in processing of caspase- <dig> and upregulation of caspase- <dig>  the neuronal nlrp <dig> inflammasome is a multiprotein complex consisting of inflammatory caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  nlrp <dig>  the adaptor protein asc and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein xiap. assembly and activation of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome involves caspase - <dig> and - <dig> activation that subsequently leads to maturation and secretion of il-1β and il- <dig>  <cit> . once secreted, these cytokines initiate inflammatory processes throughout the cns. in addition, we have previously shown that the nlrp <dig> inflammasome interacts with the pore forming protein pannexin- <dig> and the purinergic receptor p2x <dig>  <cit> . aging leads to significant cognitive impairment in hippocampal dependent spatial learning tasks  <cit>  that may be associated with increased inflammatory cytokine production resulting from nlrp <dig> activation. thus, the nlrp <dig> inflammasome constitutes an important arm of the innate cns inflammatory response associated with aging in the hippocampus.

il-1β is synthesized by neuronal and glial cells  <cit>  and is released in response to injury, insult and stress  <cit> . we found that hippocampal neurons, which are generally not associated with immune functions, express nlrp <dig> inflammasome proteins. these results are in agreement with previous findings that show nlrp <dig> expression in neurons of the spinal  <cit>  and cerebral cortex  <cit>  after injury. moreover, the cellular distribution of nlrp <dig> inflammasome proteins changed during the aging process. our results suggest that nlrp <dig> inflammasome activity is fundamental for the processing of il-1β and il- <dig> and for the innate inflammatory response in aged neurons. however, asc, caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> are also present in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells. therefore, characterization of the composition and subcellular localization of inflammasomes in glia may provide a clearer insight into the mechanisms leading to cytokine secretion and cell death caused by caspase- <dig> with aging. thus, aging-induced nlrp <dig> inflammasome activation in neurons could lead to reactive gliosis in neighboring cells mediated by il- <dig> cytokines released from neurons.

the inflammasome in hippocampal neurons is a protein complex containing nlrp <dig> as a scaffolding protein that activates caspase- <dig> to promote il-1β and il- <dig> maturation associated with aging . although the total levels of nlrp <dig> and asc in lysates did not change significantly with aging, the proportions of other key components that form the nlrp <dig> inflammasome increased. these findings are in agreement with our previous work on nlrp <dig> inflammasome regulation following spinal cord  <cit>  and traumatic brain injury  <cit>  that showed similar changes in nlrp <dig> components after injury. moreover, the inflammasome in normal tissues is speculated to be in an inactive state by binding to a putative inhibitor  <cit> , but the nature of this inhibitor has not been identified. we previously suggested that xiap in the nlrp <dig> inflammasome complex may inhibit caspase- <dig> activity preventing the activation and processing of il-1β and il- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, aging-induced activation of the inflammasome was found to be associated with cleavage of xiap into fragments. cleavage of xiap produces an n-terminal bir1- <dig> fragment with reduced ability to inhibit caspases  <cit> . therefore, aging-related xiap cleavage may reduce the threshold for activation of caspase- <dig>  leading to processing and secretion of il-1β and il- <dig> 

our results are in agreement with earlier studies that demonstrate systemic administration of il-1β results in impaired hippocampal-dependent consolidation of memories in a fear-conditioning paradigm  <cit> . neutralization of il-1β blocked the deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation  <cit> . other reports demonstrate that the aging process results in elevated concentrations of il-1β at  <dig> months of age  <cit> , whereas hippocampal il- <dig>  a closely related il- <dig> proinflammatory cytokine increases in rats as early as  <dig> months of age  <cit> . additionally, the age-specific elevation in these proinflammatory cytokines may influence deficits in long-term potentiation  <cit> . further studies are needed to determine whether the nlrp <dig> inflammasome-induced activation and increased il-1β and il- <dig> observed in our study influence deficits in synaptic transmission leading to cognitive decline.

to date, microbial pathogen-associated molecules and toxins have been identified as key triggers of activation of inflammasomes  <cit> . however, recently, environmental  <cit>  and neurodegenerative  <cit>  stimuli have been identified that lead to il-1β release by means of inflammasomes. with respect to the latter, researchers  <cit>  demonstrated that the nlrp <dig> inflammasome is activated by fibrous particles of amyloid-beta that results in cleavage of caspase- <dig> and production of il-1β in microglia and macrophages. however, it is not known whether amyloid-beta activates the nlrp <dig> inflammasome in neurons thus further enhancing production of il-1β in the aging brain. our recent work demonstrated that the pore-forming protein pannexin- <dig> in neurons and astrocytes transports the extracellular k+ ions to stimulate the nlrp <dig> inflammasome in the cytoplasm after p2x <dig> receptors bind atp  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the aging-induced increases in pannexin- <dig> and p2x <dig> expression in hippocampal neurons observed in this study may facilitate k+ influx, thereby initiating nlrp <dig> inflammasome activation.

probenecid is an inhibitor of renal tubular transporters, regularly used in the treatment of gout. however, probenecid-sensitive transporters are found throughout the body including the immune privileged cns  <cit> . using in vivo microdialysis techniques, one study examined the transport of probenecid across the blood brain barrier , reporting the presence of probenecid in cerebrospinal fluid, brain interstitial fluid, and brain tissue tissue  <cit> . therefore, in the present study, we chose a course of treatment based on the recent identification of probenecid as an inhibitor of inflammasome activation in neurons and astrocytes  <cit> . we were specifically interested in the effect of probenecid treatment in improving cognitive deficits observed in aged rats. young rats did not demonstrate impairment in spatial learning and therefore were not tested in the probenecid study. we hypothesized that probenecid may reduce cognitive impairment in aged rats via inhibition of inflammasome activation in the hippocampus. accordingly, our findings support the use of probenecid as an anti-inflammatory therapy in the cns. the aging-induced elevation in inflammasome activation in the hippocampus was attenuated by probenecid treatment, resulting in improved cognitive outcomes for aged rats in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
our main findings suggest that the aged brain experiences heightened activation of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome system with resultant increases in caspase  <dig> activation and inflammatory cytokines il-1β and il- <dig> corresponding to impaired spatial learning in aged rats. since these cytokines contribute to the pathology of different neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer disease  <cit>  and parkinson disease  <cit> . and are involved in a positive feedback mechanism in which more cytokines are produced upon cytokine release  <cit> , it is reasonable to hypothesize that interfering with inflammasome activation may prove to be beneficial in delaying development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases in which the il- <dig> inflammatory response plays a pathogenic role.

additionally, our results suggest that inhibition of inflammasome activation in the aged brain, with systemic probenecid treatment, reduces caspase- <dig> activation and, in turn, reduces inflammatory cytokines, il-1β and il- <dig>  which have been linked to age-related cognitive decline. because probenecid is an inhibitor of protein transporters found throughout the body  <cit> , it is possible that the effect of probenecid on cognitive performance may be multifactorial. additionally, one must consider the potential exerted by probenecid to increase levels of neuroprotectants such as kynurenic acid  when administered with the precursor of kyna, l-kynurennine  in toxic disease models in rats  <cit> . the effect of probenecid on kyna levels in the aged brain deserves further study. however, our data suggest that therapeutic intervention with probenecid alone or another agent that inhibits the nlrp <dig> inflammasome, with corresponding reduction in proinflammatory cytokines, may improve overall cognitive outcomes and reduce symptoms of normal cognitive aging. in addition, the therapeutic use of probenecid in young and aged animals with neuroinflammation due to disease or injury also deserves further study.
