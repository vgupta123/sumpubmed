BACKGROUND
adaptive radiation, ‘the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and attendant adaptations in different species within a lineage’ is one of the most important processes bridging the gap between ecology and evolution  <cit> . usually, the genetic divergence between species within adaptive radiations is very small, and only a handful of genes with large effects are responsible for differences in ecologically significant traits and reproductive isolation between species. due to the lack of availability of molecular markers for rapidly evolving taxa, especially from nuclear genome, most plant molecular systematic studies on adaptive radiation have hitherto failed to provide resolved phylogenies. the same is true for speciation studies, which rely heavily on there being sufficient intraspecific genetic variation. moreover, we still have little understanding of how divergent natural selection may have acted on the genomes of such species within the short evolutionary time span since their common ancestor  <cit> .

transcriptome analysis is not only an effective way to study gene expression in specific tissues at specific time, and it also provides unprecedented opportunities to address comparative genomic-level questions for non-model organisms. rna-sequencing  is an efficient new technology for large scale transcriptome investigations. with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing , rna-sequencing becomes more efficient and less expensive, and is increasingly being used to study the evolutionary origins and ecology of non-model plants  <cit> . for instance, a large number of microsatellite markers or single-copy nuclear genes in yam   <cit> , buckwheat   <cit>  and big sagebrush   <cit>  have been identified by making use of rna-sequencing. since rna-sequencing is still somewhat expensive at present, few rna-seq studies to date have included for more than one species at the same time  <cit> . however, comparative rna-sequencing studies between closely related species can in principle not only provide additional genomic resources such as genus-specific ssr primers or single copy nuclear gene primers, but also give information about the processes of speciation or adaptive evolution, e.g. divergence time estimations, or detection of adaptive loci.

primula with around  <dig> species, is one of the three great garden genera  <cit> , and southwestern china, in which ca.  <dig> species of the genus are distributed, is its diversity centre  <cit> . in this region primula shows a typical patterns of adaptive evolution and explosive speciation; however, research has been hampered by the fact that few primula genomic resources are available. up to now, only a few ssr primers from the three primula species p. vulgaris, p. obconica, and p. sieboldii have been developed  <cit> , and only one large est collection, consisting of  <dig>  ests generated from primula sieboldii were available  <cit> . paucity of genetic data such as genome sequences, transcriptome sequences and associated molecular markers has made primula breeding or evolutionary analysis a challenging task.

primula section proliferae pax, which contains ca. 25– <dig> species and is centred on southwestern china, is regarded as a taxonomically well-known group circumscribed by possession of numerous whorls of flowers  <cit> . within this section, primula wilsonii and p. poissonii are two closely related species with very similar morphological characters, and the two diagnostic characters used to distinguish them are the corolla structure and the aromatic fragrance of fresh leaves; for p. wilsonii, the fresh leaves are fragrant and corolla limbs are slightly opened, whereas, p. poissonii has no obvious fragrance and widely opened corolla limbs  <cit> . these closely related species represent a useful resource for addressing two questions: how did primula species in southwestern china radiate within a short period of time, and what was the driving force underlying the process of rapid adaptive evolution? as the first step towards answering these questions, in this study, we obtained transcriptomes for primula poissonii and p. wilsonii using the illumina platform, and carried out a comprehensive analysis of them. our aims were to 1) characterize the transcriptomes of p. poissonii and p. wilsonii, and increase the genetic resources available for primula breeding or evolutionary analysis; 2) determine the evolutionary dynamics of the two species, including obtaining a divergence time estimation, signatures of adaptive evolution between the two species; and 3) discover genus-specific ssr markers and single-copy nuclear gene markers from both species.

RESULTS
de novo assembly and functional annotation of contigs
after cleaning of raw sequences, ca.  <dig> million 75-bp paired-end reads were obtained for both p. poissonii and p. wilsonii,. we obtained  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of  <dig> and an n <dig> value of  <dig> for p. poissonii, and  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of  <dig> and an n <dig> value of  <dig>  for p. wilsonii . contig with lengths between  <dig> and 500 bp were overrepresented, making up about 56% of the total number of contigs for p. poissonii, and 53% for p. wilsonii, the next most abundant size class was 500–1000 bp, constituting about 24% and 24% of the total, respectively . to evaluate the quality of de novo assembly, we obtained a total of  <dig>  peptide sequences from vitis. for p. poissonii,  <dig>  contigs were annotated to  <dig>   vitis proteins, of which,  <dig>   proteins were covered for at least 70% of the full length. for p. wilsonii,  <dig>  contigs were annotated to  <dig>   vitis proteins, of which,  <dig>  proteins were covered at least 70% of the full length. the gc content for p. poissonii and p. wilsonii sequences is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

in blastx homology research with the cutoff e-value set at 1e- <dig>   <dig>  contigs  for p. poissonii and  <dig>  contigs  for p. wilsonii gave hits. for both species, the three top-hit species were vitis vinfera, populus trichocarpa and ricinus communis . a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   contigs were assigned at least one go terms for p. poissonii and p. wilsonii, respectively. for the biological process category, the two mostly highly represented terms among the  <dig> level- <dig> categories were cellular process and metabolic process; for the molecular function category, among the  <dig> level- <dig> categories, binding and catalytic activity were overrepresented; for the  <dig> level- <dig> categories in the cellular component category, cell, cell part and organelle were the most abundant terms . these categories were similarly distributed in both species.

orthologous contigs, substitution rates, and transcriptome divergence between two primula species
we identified  <dig>  pairs of putative orthologous contigs between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii using the reciprocal best hit method with blastn algorithm. after incorporating the vitis peptide sequences  <cit> ,  <dig>  pairs of putative orthologs were obtained using the rbm triangulation method  <cit> . this reduction in ortholog numbers was caused mainly by the exclusion of the relatively young orthologs specific to primula, which were discarded as being low similarity to vitis. after excluding alignments with unexpected stop codons, lengths less than 150 bp or ks values above  <dig> ,  <dig>  pairs of orthologs were retained for subsequent analysis.

using the vitis proteins as reference, the coding regions of  <dig>  pairs of orthologs from p. poissonii and p. wilsonii were extracted, in some cases, 5′-utr  or 3′-utr  were also determined. the average genetic divergence of coding regions between the two primula species is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  according to the k2p model. the genetic divergence between the two species is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for 5′-utr and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for 3′-utr regions. the accelerated substitution rate observed in the 5′utr and 3′ utr relative to the coding region, is indicative of relaxed functional constraint on the evolution of the utr than on the coding region at the genome level, which is consistent with the evidence from other model species-pairs  <cit> .

among the  <dig>  pairs of orthologs between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii,  <dig> pairs were identical,  <dig>  pairs had only either synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions, and  <dig>  pairs had both types of substitutions, for which the ka/ks ratio were calculated. the mean values of ka, ks, and the ka/ks ratio of all orthologous pairs were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. of the  <dig>  pairs of orthologs,  <dig> pairs with a ka/ks value >  <dig> were found. taking a more appropriate threshold of  <dig>  for the ka/ks ratio as an indicator of positive selection  <cit> ,  <dig> pairs with a ka/ks value between  <dig>  and  <dig> were also found.

peaks in the ks value distribution of orthologs between closely related species often indicates speciation events  <cit> , and this approach has been successfully used in the inference of such events  <cit> . in this study, a peak of ks distribution between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii was observed at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the low level of ks between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii indicated their close relationship and confirmed the previous taxonomic treatment. based on the data derived from ests of asteraceae and several model plants provided by kane  <cit>  , we found a mean ks value of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  between congeneric species. according to these criteria, the differentiation between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii is obviously very recent.

the peak synonymous rates  for orthologous transcript pairs can be used to estimate the times of divergence between species. to obtain a rough estimate of the divergence time  between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii, we followed the simple formula: t = k/2r  <cit> , where r is the mean rate of synonymous substitution, and is considered to be  <dig> e- <dig> substitutions/synonymous site/year for all dicots  <cit> ; k is genetic divergence expressed in terms of mean number of synonymous substitutions between orthologs. the age of the speciation event between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii is approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, which falls between the donau and gunz glaciation in the middle pleistocene. bearing in mind disputes about the substitution rate  <cit> , this divergence time is only an appropriate estimate based on the coding region of orthologous genes, nonetheless, it is useful because there is as yet no adequate fossil dating the divergence of the two primula species.

functions under positive selection and implications for adaptive evolution between two primula species
in enrichment analyses, we categorized the orthologs into two datasets: a test dataset with ka/ks >  <dig> , and a reference dataset with ka/ks <  <dig> . in an analysis of go terms with at least five hits,  <dig> go-terms annotated to  <dig> pairs of orthologs were found to be over-represented  in the test dataset . for the  <dig> selected genes, we used blastx search to find their orthologous genes in arabidopsis, and the results showed that the genes with function in dna repair, stress resistance were overrepresented . among the candidate genes under positive selection with ka/ks >  <dig> , almost one-quarter of them were involved in the dna repair. dna repair is essential for maintenance of genomic stability in all organisms. for instance, in our study, the ortholog pw <dig>  and pw <dig> were found to be homologous to ku <dig> and ku <dig>  which are involved in the repair of dna double-strand breaks  by non-homologous end joining   <cit> ; other orthologs, pw <dig>  pw <dig>  pw <dig> were homologous to smc <dig>  etg <dig>  ror <dig>  respectively, which are all involved in dna repair by homologous recombination  <cit> . the finding that gene families ku, and smc have been under positive selection gives an indication of why p. poissonii adapted to the habitats of higher altitude and ionizing radiation than did p. wilsonii.

some orthologs related to abiotic stress were also found to be positively selected. for example, pw <dig> is homologous to gpx <dig>  which regulates cellular photooxidative tolerance and immune response  <cit> ; pw <dig> is homologus to arp <dig>  related to light-induced stomatal opening  <cit> ; pw <dig> is homologous to lew <dig>  the product of which catalyzes the biosynthesis of dolichol  <cit>  and confers acclimation to drought stress, which may partially explain why the two primula species were able to inhabit habitats with different level of aridity; pw <dig> is homologous to sbp <dig> and pw <dig> is homologous to fer <dig>  which are involved in the cadmium stress  <cit>  and iron deficiency  <cit> , respectively; these results shed further light on how the two primula species differentially adapted to extreme environments. in addition, two positively selected genes are worth notice, one gene pw <dig>  is homologous to ap <dig>  a key component in the abc mode of flower development  <cit> , and may provide a clue about the origin of the differences in corolla structure between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii; the other gene pw <dig>  is homologous to myb <dig>  which functions as a r2r3-myb transcription factor in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  <cit> , also may give some hints on the leaf fragrance differentiation between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii.

overall, in this study, we detected a dozens of gene under positive selection between the primula species pairs, and these findings will not only shed light on how differentiations between two primula species occurs, but also open the door to increased understanding of how plants living in plateau environments adapt to different characteristics of high altitude, such as strong radiation, aridity and so on.

identification of microsatellites and single copy genes
usually, ssr markers derived from expressed sequence tags  are more transferable between species than random genomic ssrs, and they are more advantageous for revealing adaptive differentiations at the population level. traditional strategies for ssr marker development are labour-intensive and costly. in the case of primula, up to now, only a few microsatellite primers have been available for primula obconica, p. sieboldii and p. vulgaris <cit> , and this has impeded genetic analysis of this important garden plant. based on the two primula transcriptomes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ssrs were found in p. poissonii and p. wilsonii, respectively. the most abundant repeat types were dinucleotides followed by trinucleotides . the dominant classes of sequence repeat in the contigs were ag/ct, at/ta and ac/gt, followed by aag/ctt repeats , and most ssrs located close to the ends of contigs and were not suitable for primer design . in order to maximize the universal applicability of markers developed in this study and hence reduce their cost, we searched for ssrs in the  <dig>  pairs of putative orthologous contigs, and found  <dig>  ssrs distributed among  <dig>  pairs of contigs . taking only those with a repeat-unit length of at least 16 bp,  <dig> pairs of ssrs contained in  <dig> pairs of orthologs were selected for primer design, and  <dig> pairs of sequences with conserved, sufficiently long flanking sites were used to design primers successfully . to evaluate the reliability of these primers, we tested  <dig> out of the  <dig> pairs and  <dig> pairs produced clear fragments with the expected sizes in both primula species .

one noteworthy fact about the ssr primer development based on the illumina platform is the lower proportion of contigs suitable for primer design compared with sanger sequencing, in our study,  <dig> out of the  <dig> pairs of contigs with ssrs were excluded from primer design because they had insufficient flanking regions caused by ngs assembly algorithms or sequencing  <cit> . as an alternative, the 454/roche sequencing platform, which delivers longer reads, has promise as a way of reducing bias.

using the apvo gene sets  <cit>  to carry out tblastn queries against our primula dataset orthologs,  <dig> of the apvo genes were found to give hits against orthologous contigs between p. poissonii and p. wilsonii over at least 600 bp; these are most likely to be single copy genes in the two primula species. when we set a threshold identity of 75% with arabidopsis thaliana and specified facultative intron sizes not less than 300 bp in arabidopsis thaliana, we were successful in obtaining primers for  <dig> of the  <dig> apvo genes ; we randomly selected four primer pairs to test, and of these, three of the pairs amplified successfully and when the products were sequenced directly, they yielded the expected gene model, and only one primer pair failed due to the presence of extremely long intron variants, which made the products unsuitable for sanger sequencing.. the availability from this study of dozens of single copy nuclear genes with heterogeneous rates of variation, will undoubtedly facilitate phylogeny resolution for the radiative primula species, and open a doorway to understanding the dynamics of speciation using a population genetics approach.

we developed sets of two types of molecular markers, and these two widely-used marker types, each of which has its own advantages, were applied for characterizing population structure, parentage analysis, genotyping, gene flow inferences and phylogenetic construction. the large number of novel single nuclear gene will greatly increase the resolution of phylogenetic reconstruction for this adaptive taxon. moreover, these markers with their diverse evolutionary rates will provide unprecedented opportunities to answer the following important questions: what demographic histories underlie the phylogeographic patterns of primula species? which evolutionary forces drive the explosive radiation of primula species in the extreme habitats?

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized the transcriptomes for the two primula species, and obtained an unprecedented amount of genomic resources for these important garden plants. evolutionary analysis of these two species not only yielded a more precise divergence time, but also provided some novel insights into how differential adaptations occurred in extreme habitats. in addition, we developed two sets of genetic markers of popular types, single copy nuclear genes and nuclear microsatellites . these marker sets will facilitate studies on the genetic improvement, population genetics and phylogenetics of this rapidly adapting taxon.
