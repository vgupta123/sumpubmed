BACKGROUND
reproductive isolation between incipient species is of particular relevance to the process of speciation. reproductive character displacement - 'the pattern of greater divergence of a  isolating trait in areas of sympatry between closely related taxa than in areas of allopatry'  <cit>  is a common and taxonomically widespread pattern which is of great interest when studying reproductive isolation  <cit> . evidence for rcd comes from groups as diverse as fungi  <cit> , plants  <cit> , insects  <cit>  mollusks  <cit> , fish  <cit>  and amphibians  <cit> . however, the majority of rcd examples come from the drosophila literature  <cit> .

the study of rcd has historically been tied to the process of reinforcement, the evolution of prezygotic isolation resulting from selection against hybrid individuals  <cit> . more recently, however, workers have emphasized that rcd can be caused by other factors, including ecological variables  <cit> . but even where selection has been shown to play a role in rcd  <cit> , the specific action of this selection remains unknown.

rcd has been documented in several taxa of marine broadcast spawning organisms  <cit> . the study of rcd is often more tractable in broadcast spawners than in internal fertilizers. broadcast spawning individuals simultaneously release sperm and eggs into the water column, where fertilization occurs. therefore, behavioral and mechanical isolation are absent in broadcast spawning organisms and if two sympatric broadcast spawning species are not temporally isolated  <cit> , prezygotic barriers between these two species occur only during the fertilization process. such barriers are usually a consequence of differences in the way in which sperm and egg proteins interact, so rcd is often manifest as faster evolution of these proteins between species in sympatry than allopatry  <cit> . rapid evolution of these proteins appears to proceed through the action of positive  selection, increasing the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions  relative to synonymous substitutions   <cit> .

new information has allowed us to use the broadcast spawning ascidian ciona intestinalis, a longtime model in developmental biology, to study the early stages of rcd. c. intestinalis comprises two distinct and divergent lineages, now termed type a and type b  <cit> , type a is thought to be native to the northwestern pacific ocean and to have invaded the eastern pacific ocean, the mediterranean sea, the atlantic coast of south africa, and the black sea  <cit> . type b, native to the northern atlantic ocean  <cit> , has invaded the western atlantic ocean  <cit> . the ranges of type a and b overlap in the english channel and the atlantic coast of france, where limited introgression occurs between type a and b individuals from these sympatric populations  <cit> . hybrids from crosses between allopatric individuals are sterile or inviable in the laboratory  <cit> , but the evidence for introgression in nature shows that these two lineages are not completely reproductively isolated. nothing is yet known about pre or postzygotic barriers in sympatry.

here, we first identify a set of candidate gamete recognition proteins  from c. intestinalis using proteomic and bioinformatic techniques and test whether these proteins evolve more rapidly than control proteins. then, choosing a subset of these proteins that show evidence of positive selection, we directly test the rcd hypothesis by comparing divergence and polymorphism statistics in sympatric and allopatric populations of type a and b c. intestinalis. we ask whether signatures of positive selection are stronger in sympatric than allopatric populations.

RESULTS
identification of candidate grps from sperm: proteomics
 <dig> sperm proteins were identified by lc-ms/ms . each of these proteins was subsequently identified using one or more of the following sections of the cipro database : the descriptive summary available for many proteins, the pfam domain search, and the blastp search, or the go  program.  <dig> of the proteins are unlikely to be grps; they are likely involved in the movement or metabolism of the sperm . the identities of these  <dig> proteins are available from the authors. of the remaining  <dig> proteins, seven were likely grps, and  <dig> could not be identified as similar to any known proteins. of these  <dig> proteins, four could not be analyzed because primers based on the type a genome sequence would not amplify the homolog from type b individuals. an additional gene could not be analyzed because the gene encoding the protein did not have significant tblastn hits to the type a genome . we selected the remaining  <dig> proteins for further analysis,  <dig> of which were likely grps.

identification of candidate grps proteins from sperm: bioinformatics
we also used a bioinformatic approach to identify potential grps. first, we accessed the functional classifications of type a testis ests sequenced by  <cit>  and selected  <dig> ests that might code for grps. we then located the genes corresponding to these ests with the kog  tool provided on jgi's  c. intestinalis genome browser http://genome.jgi-psf.org/cioin2/cioin <dig> home.html. these genes were then searched against the cipro database using blastx to identify resulting protein matches.  <dig> of these proteins were determined to be grp candidates, but  <dig> failed to amplify and/or sequence in type b individuals; the remaining nine were selected for further study.

second, we located every protein in the cipro database that was identified as being expressed only in testes. we chose a subset of  <dig> of these proteins that were likely grps, of which nine could be amplified from type b cdna. in total, we selected  <dig> candidate grps identified proteomically and  <dig> identified bioinformatically. we also selected  <dig> control proteins  from the proteomic analyses to compare with the putative grps. these control proteins, cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig> and cipro <dig> . <dig>  were selected because pfam domain and blastp searches in cipro identified them as proteins involved in basic cellular processes rather than fertilization .

comparison of dn/ds values between candidate grps and control proteins
the dn/ds values for candidate grps are significantly higher than the dn/ds values for control proteins .

however, paml analyses assume that ds values are constant across a sequence. if some sites across the sequence have unusually low ds values, a high dn/ds value could be inferred in the absence of positive selection  <cit> . thus, significantly higher dn/ds values for candidate gamete recognition genes than for control genes could be the result of either higher dn or lower ds values in the candidate recognition genes, and only higher dn values provide evidence of positive selection.

to address this issue, we performed two-tailed mann-whitney u test in r , comparing dn values in candidate gamete recognition vs. control genes, and ds values in candidate gamete recognition vs. control genes. dn values were significantly different between candidate gamete recognition and control genes , whereas ds values were not . these tests are consistent with the assumption that dn, rather than ds, is driving the observed pattern.

cipro <dig> . <dig> was identified proteomically, and its function is unknown. cipro <dig> . <dig> is a large protein , and was therefore divided into three sections for sequencing. sections  <dig>   <dig>  and all  <dig> sections analyzed together had dn/ds values less than  <dig> , so only section  <dig> was analyzed in subsequent sympatric vs. allopatric comparisons. section  <dig> of cipro <dig> . <dig> had a dn/ds equal to  <dig> , a dn equal to  <dig> , and a ds equal to  <dig> . one protein, cipro <dig> . <dig>  has a dn/ds ratio lower than  <dig> , but was identified in the cipro database as a metalloproteinase and has a go biological function of "sperm binding to zona pellucida" . we chose these three proteins for the sympatric vs. allopatric comparisons, either because they showed evidence of positive selection , or because their putative function was so clearly related to gamete recognition .

sympatric vs. allopatric divergence analyses
the results of the divergence analyses are shown in table  <dig>  for all of the candidate grps and control proteins, the 95% credible interval of the distribution of the differences between sympatric and allopatric ω  values included zero. this indicates that omega values were not significantly different between sympatry and allopatry for any of the proteins examined. not enough variation was present in the sympatric type a alleles for cipro <dig> . <dig> or mtcoi to obtain reliable omega values, so the sympatric type a vs. allopatric type a comparison could not be performed for these proteins.

sympatric vs. allopatric polymorphism analyses
the summary statistics are shown in table  <dig>  no consistent differences between sympatric and allopatric type a or between sympatric and allopatric type b can be discerned for any of these statistics for any of these candidate genes. table  <dig> presents the results of the mcdonald-kreitman tests. fixed nonsynonymous substitutions are not more common in sympatric than allopatric comparisons; these tests provide no evidence for positive selection on the genes encoding these three candidate grps in sympatry. none of the statistics for which significance was determined by coalescent simulation  showed significant differences between sympatry and allopatry for any of the genes examined, as the confidence intervals for sympatric populations always contained the mean values for allopatric populations, and vice versa .

n is the number of alleles sequenced from each population.

fs = fixed synonymous. ps = polymorphic synonymous. fn = fixed nonsynonymous. pn = polymorphic nonsynonymous

discussion
comparison of dn/ds values between candidate grps and control proteins
candidate grps in c. intestinalis are evolving more rapidly than control proteins, and this pattern is likely driven by substitutions at nonsynonymous sites. rapid evolution has been documented at specific grps  in marine broadcast spawners, and dn/ds values are lower for mtcoi than the grps lysin and verl for green and pink abalone  <cit> . the pattern we see in c. intestinalis has also been documented in insects and mammals . this study suggests that a pattern of faster evolution in reproductive proteins may apply to external as well as internal fertilizers.

one explanation for faster evolution in candidate grps than control proteins is sperm competition, which occurs in ciona as it does in internal fertilizers. selection could be acting on any proteins that determine how quickly sperm fertilize eggs: proteins involved in metabolism, motility, binding, penetration, etc. however, as figure  <dig> shows that candidate grps are evolving more rapidly than sperm proteins that are not candidate grps , proteins directly involved in sperm-egg interactions are more likely to be experiencing directional selection than those involved in facilitating sperm access to the egg.

rapid evolution of sperm grps might also result from sexual conflict, which occurs when the optimal outcomes of fertilization are different for sperm and eggs. for sperm, the optimal outcome is fertilization of an egg as quickly as possible. but in many taxa, fertilization of eggs by multiple sperm  results in developmental defects. therefore, the optimal outcome of fertilization for an egg may be slower fertilization, to avoid polyspermy  <cit> . ascidians like c. intestinalis often live in close proximity to many conspecific individuals  <cit> , and an individual usually sends sperm into the water column before eggs . so eggs are usually released into a vast amount of sperm spawned from many neighbors, making the risk of polyspermy very high. perhaps in response to this risk, ascidians have evolved two separate blocks to polyspermy, whereas many other marine broadcast spawners have a single block  <cit> . given these effective polyspermy blocks, sexual conflict resulting from polyspermy is not likely to be major driver of grp evolution in ascidians.

reinforcement could be driving the enhanced prezygotic isolation in sympatry. we know that hybrids between allopatric populations type a and b c. intestinalis are sterile or inviable in the laboratory, so selection could favor grps that allow sperm to preferentially bind to conspecific eggs. however, reinforcing selection could be counteracted by gene flow from allopatric populations  <cit> , especially when secondary contact is recent. pairwise fst calculations between sympatric and allopatric type a, and sympatric and allopatric type b populations show that these populations are not significantly differentiated at any of the three genes encoding the grps ; migration may therefore be occurring between sympatric and allopatric populations.

lastly, egg surface proteins could be changing rapidly to prevent pathogens from entering the egg. if the same proteins involved in preventing microbial attack are involved in sperm/egg recognition, this could lead to the rapid evolution of sperm proteins to keep up with the ever-changing egg proteins.

evolution of candidate grps in ciona intestinalis - no evidence for rcd
our data provide no evidence that positive selection is enhanced in sympatry, and if these candidate grps are involved in prezygotic isolation, we have no evidence for enhanced prezygotic isolation. the polymorphism statistics likewise give no indication that rcd is occurring in these three proteins.

we cannot necessarily conclude from lack of evidence for rcd in cipro <dig> . <dig>  cipro <dig> . <dig> and cipro <dig> . <dig> that rcd is not occurring in this system. if enhanced prezygotic isolation between type a and b does exist, there are several reasons why we might not have detected it in this study. first, primers for candidate grps were developed from the type a genomic sequence and were used to amplify and sequence both type a and b individuals . but type a and b are substantially divergent , which could explain why  <dig> genes encoding grp candidates could not be successfully amplified and/or sequenced in type b individuals. it is possible that the genes that could not be amplified and/or sequenced  encode proteins that are evolving more rapidly between type a and b than those that were included in the analyses. if this is the case, we may have missed proteins for which dn/ds values are > <dig>  proteins that would have been included in the sympatric vs. allopatric tests of rcd.

it is, of course, also possible that the three proteins that have high dn/ds values are themselves not involved in gamete recognition. while some aspects of the fertilization process in solitary ascidians such as c. intestinalis are well-characterized  <cit> , the genes and corresponding proteins responsible for species-specificity have not been identified, as they have in other marine broadcast spawners  <cit> .

two sperm proteins that interact directly with the egg have been identified in c. intestinalis, but it is not known whether these proteins are involved in gamete recognition. the first protein is α l-fucosidase, which binds to the vitelline coat of the egg  <cit> . five of our candidate grps  had domains also found in α l-fucosidases, but none of these proteins were expressed in testis tissue, based on expression data in cipro. cipro <dig> . <dig> could not be amplified from type b, and the other four genes did not have dn/ds ratios >  <dig> . a second protein involved in sperm-egg interactions is a chymotrypsin-like enzyme that may dissolve the vitelline coat of the egg  <cit> . however, the amino acid sequence for this protein is not available and we identified dozens of chymotrypsin-like proteins in the genome.

temporal isolation of types a and b could also contribute to prezygotic barriers. we do not know whether type a and b release gametes at the same time of day or in the same season in the english channel. since some gene flow has occurred  <cit> , spawning must at least partially overlap.

gene flow between sympatric and allopatric populations could be obscuring rcd if it is occurring in this system. pairwise fst calculations show that sympatric and allopatric populations of each type are not significantly differentiated, so gene flow between sympatric and allopatric populations is a possibility.

finally, because secondary contact between type a and b c. intestinalis in the english channel may well be recent, rcd may not have yet taken place. type b is native to northern europe and presumably a long-time resident of the english channel. we do not know when type a invaded the english channel. the first published record of type a in this area was in  <dig>  <cit> , but as type a and b were only recognized in  <dig>  <cit> , type a living in this area prior to  <dig> would not have been distinguished from the native type b. however, the introduction of type a was likely human-mediated  <cit> , and therefore a recent invasion on an evolutionary timescale. evidence for rcd has been found in several systems where secondary contact is relatively recent. for example, rcd in mate choice is observed when limnetic and benthic sticklebacks co-occur in glacial lakes in british columbia  <cit> . similarly, rcd has been documented in the mus musculus and mus domesticus hybrid zone, which is thought to represent secondary contact during the neolithic   <cit> .

positive selection on grps in other marine broadcast spawners: rcd
some of the most rapidly evolving proteins yet discovered are grps in marine broadcast spawners . in sea urchins, the bindin protein facilitates sperm attachment to the egg and fusion of sperm and egg  <cit> . in three genera of sea urchin that include sympatric species , regions of bindin show evidence of positive selection . in arbacia, lytechinus and tripneustes, genera that do not contain sympatric species, bindin shows no evidence of positive selection . this pattern is consistent with rcd on bindin in sea urchins.

stronger evidence for rcd comes from a study of echinometra oblonga, which has populations that are sympatric and allopatric with echinometra species c  <cit> . substantial divergence in bindin alleles between e. oblonga and e. sp. c. occurs where the two species are sympatric, but not where they are allopatric  <cit> .

in abalone and mussels, sperm proteins known as lysins are involved in dissolution of the egg vitelline envelope, enabling the sperm to enter the egg. the best-characterized lysins are in the abalone genus haliotis. an early study of  <dig> sympatric haliotis species  found many pairwise comparisons with dn/ds values >  <dig>  <cit> . a later study of  <dig> species corroborated the pairwise results of  <cit>  and also used maximum likelihood models of codon substitution to identify lineage and site-specific evidence of positive selection  <cit> . lineages containing sympatric or closely related species usually had dn/ds values >  <dig>  whereas lineages with distantly related allopatric species always had dn/ds values <  <dig>  a pattern consistent with rcd  <cit> . but the authors also note a dn/ds value >  <dig> for the two branches separating a group of japanese species from two groups of californian species; this speciation event was likely allopatric.

in the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis, two divergent clades of lysin-m <dig> have been found: g and gd  <cit> . evidence of positive selection is seen between g and gd, and within gd  <cit> . the divergence between the two clades is the result of rapid evolution in the gd clade, and gd alleles are found at higher frequencies in sympatric populations of m. galloprovincialis  than in allopatric populations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
enhanced prezygotic isolation in sympatry has become a well-known feature of grps in marine broadcast spawners. but in most cases the evolutionary process or processes responsible for this pattern have not been identified. differentiating between the processes that can lead to patterns of rcd will provide important insights into the process of speciation in marine broadcast spawners.
