BACKGROUND
heat and drought stress and their combination are the most important stresses experienced by plants and they are responsible of a large fraction of productivity losses  <cit> . plants respond to stress with a wide range of modifications leading to changes at morphological, cellular, physiological, biochemical, and molecular level  <cit> . a relevant component of the plant adaptation to stress conditions is dependent on transcriptional changes and the expression of key genes results in enhanced stress tolerance  <cit> . overall, the molecular response of plants to abiotic stress is mediated by a number of molecules involved in signal transduction leading to the activation of specific gene networks resulting from the re-programming of cell expression machinery. to these networks belong genes coding for a variety of proteins involved in dna remodeling, transcription regulation, protein modifications, etc.  <cit> . a number of publications described the transcriptional changes induced in response to drought  and heat  <cit>  stresses, however much less is known when plants are simultaneously subjected to drought and heat stress, an event very common under field conditions. several works indicate that the molecular response to the combination of heat and drought activates networks that are different from those activated by heat or drought stress taken singularly . furthermore, most of the publications cited above have been carried out on seedlings and therefore might not reflect exactly the molecular response of crops exposed to stress when plants are in more advanced growing stages.

durum wheat is an important cereal crop grown mainly in semi-arid environments  characterized by water scarcity and high temperatures often occurring at the same time. the two durum wheat cultivars cappelli and ofanto, contrasting for many agronomic and physiological traits, have been extensively characterized . measures based on stomata conductance and on grain carbon isotope discrimination from field trials and growth chamber experiments consistently showed a higher water use efficiency  in cappelli compared to ofanto, a finding correlated with a different stomata conductance  over a range of relative soil water contents  <cit> . a ril segregating population with a corresponding molecular marker map has also been developed from the cross between ofanto and cappelli  <cit>  and used to localize qtls for leaf porosity and chlorophyll content in field conditions  <cit> .

this work reports on a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis carried out on the durum wheat cultivars cappelli and ofanto grown to booting stage and subjected to heat, drought and to a combination of drought and heat stresses, conditions similar to the experience of a crop grown in mediterranean environments and exposed to a terminal heat/drought stress. furthermore, several selected drought-related genes have been tested in the same cultivars exposed to drought at tillering stage to confirm the constitutive nature of the different stress response strategy detected at booting stage. a gene selected among those characterized by different stress response between the two cultivars was used for an expression qtl analysis and the corresponding qtl was mapped on chromosome 6b.

RESULTS
sample preparation and hybridization quality
plants of two triticum turgidum subsp. durum cultivars, ofanto and cappelli, were grown in controlled conditions and exposed to drought stress , heat stress  and to a combination of heat and drought stresses  when they reached the booting stage. control  plants were watered to maintain a soil water content  equal to 28%. ds was imposed by withholding water and allowing the pots to reach a swc equal to  <dig> %, while hs was imposed progressively exposing the plants for two days at 30°c followed by additional two days at 34°c, and subsequently to 40°c. for cs the two treatments were combined in order to achieve simultaneously  <dig> % swc and 40°c. more details are reported in the methods section. table  <dig> reports the flag leaf temperature and the relative water content  determined on the same plants used for rna isolation immediately before sampling. cappelli was characterized by higher leaf temperature compared to ofanto, a finding in agreement with a lower transpiration capacity due to a lower stomatal conductance as reported by rizza et al.  <cit> . nevertheless, cappelli showed also a lower rwc compared to ofanto, a condition that could be explained by a different capacity of water uptake from soil.table  <dig>

total rna was isolated from the flag leaves and used for microarray hybridization.

the comparison of the “rna degradation plots” graphs obtained in this experiment  with those of  <dig> experiments stored in the plexdb database from  <dig> to  <dig>   <cit>  supports the high quality of the hybridizations reported in this work. the observed average background ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  units of expression, well within the parameters defined by affymetrix, and comparable with the values obtained in other experiments that have used the genechip® wheat genome array  <cit> . the “present call” percentage ranged between  <dig> % and  <dig> % among the  <dig>  probe sets indicating a degree of variability among the analyzed samples. the pearson correlation was calculated between pairs of replications within each sample. the values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

four probe sets, representing genes putatively involved in the fatty acid metabolism  were subjected to real-time qrt-pcr analysis to validate the microarray data. the observed pearson correlation between microarray and qrt-pcr data was  <dig>  .

identification of differentially expressed genes
the pca  identified two principal components explaining  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the observed variability . the first component  accounts for the treatment effect, while along the second component , the samples are separated according to the genotype. the vicinity between control samples  and drought stressed samples  suggests a smaller effect of drought treatment compared to heat stress  and to the combination of heat and drought stress .figure  <dig>

to identify the genes modulated in response to the applied stress conditions, five comparisons were carried out for each cultivar: ctrl vs ds, ctrl vs hs, ctrl vs cs, ds vs cs and hs vs cs. differentially expressed genes were identified based on welch t-test with benjamini and hochberg correction for multiple testing  <cit> . a gene was considered differentially expressed when the p-value was less than  <dig>  and the ratio of induction or repression was equal to or greater than  <dig>  the analysis yielded  <dig>  not redundant differentially expressed probe sets  in cappelli and  <dig>  in ofanto. among these,  <dig>  pss differentially expressed were in common to both genotypes . ds led to the modulation of  <dig> pss in ofanto and  <dig> in cappelli with only  <dig>  in common , while hs triggered the modulation of  <dig>  pss in ofanto and  <dig>  pss in cappelli with  <dig>  pss in common . moreover, a combination of drought and heat stress activated or repressed  <dig>  pss in ofanto, and only  <dig>  in cappelli with  <dig>  sequences in common . although the different number of pss modulated in response to ds and hs can be due to different stress intensity , these results highlight very clearly that cappelli and ofanto have different stress response strategies with a minimal overlapping in terms of genes modulated in response to identical stress conditions. this finding was more evident in response to drought both as drought alone  or in combination with heat . in both conditions ofanto modulated the expression of about three times more pss than cappelli.figure  <dig>

the analysis of the  <dig> pss up-regulated in response to ds in ofanto and of their annotations highlighted that many of them were characterized by well-known drought-related functions. furthermore, functional categories related to osmotic, salt, heat and cold response were over-represented among the annotation list. for instance dehydrins , lipid transfer proteins , heat shock proteins , stress-related transcription factors , aba and drought responsive proteins  and genes coding proteins involved in drought responsive proline biosynthesis  were all up-regulated by ds in ofanto . the identification of well-known drought-related genes in ofanto plants exposed to ds demonstrates that the stress conditions applied were effective in triggering a typical drought response in ofanto, but not in cappelli. this finding suggests, once again, a different perception of drought stress and, consequently, a different molecular response of the two cultivars.

notably,  <dig> pss corresponding to several genes  induced by drought stress in ofanto but not in cappelli, showed a higher expression level in cappelli ctrl vs ofanto ctrl. these data suggest that a part of the genes expressed in ofanto in response to drought were constitutively expressed in cappelli. on the contrary, none of the  <dig> pss expressed at higher level in ofanto ctrl vs cappelli ctrl are known to be related to stress response.

in the cultivar ofanto, cs treatment led to the modulation of about  <dig>  pss. of these,  <dig>  were in common with hs,  <dig> pss were shared with the ds response and  <dig>  pss were specific of the combined treatment . in cappelli, cs modulated  <dig>  pss of which  <dig> were also modulated in response to ds and  <dig>  in response to hs . these results confirm previous findings  and highlight that the effect of cs is not a simple sum of drought and heat stress, rather it is perceived as a new stress condition.

qt-clustering analysis identifies different expression profiles in cappelli and ofanto
besides the genes commonly regulated in the two cultivars, the stress response of ofanto and cappelli was characterized by significant differences that might be associated to the different physiological behavior of these genotypes under drought stress  <cit> . to highlight commonalities and differences between the two cultivars, a qt-cluster analysis was performed to identify groups of genes with an expression profile associated to specific or common responses in the tested genotypes. the qt-clustering algorithm , run with  <dig>  differentially expressed pss, identified  <dig> clusters grouping  <dig>  pss plus  <dig>  unclassified pss . visual analysis of the  <dig> clusters highlighted a wide range of expression behaviors, no gene cluster was characterized by opposite trends between ofanto and cappelli . some clusters showed an almost identical expression profile in the two cultivars , while the others highlighted some differences in gene expression between ofanto and cappelli.

looking at the whole transcriptome numbers  the most evident difference between the stress response of ofanto and cappelli was the much stronger response of cappelli to heat stress. in this genotype 85% of all pss modulated in the experiment were responsive to hs . furthermore, the pss regulated by hs and cs in cappelli represent 77% of all pss regulated in response to cs in this genotype .

some clusters highlighted pss with a contrasting expression trend in the two cultivars across all treatments considered, these clusters could contain genes whose expression might contribute to explain the different molecular response of ofanto and cappelli to drought and heat stress. in this context the most relevant are the  <dig> clusters  showed in figure  <dig> and representing a total of  <dig>  pss, all up-regulated. in cappelli, these genes were characterized by no or almost no response to ds, while, their expression in response to hs and cs was definitely enhanced. in ofanto, the same clusters were up-regulated in at least one comparison among ctrl vs ds, ctrl vs hs, ctrl vs cs. overall the expression level of these genes was maximum under hs in cappelli, while in ofanto it was more elevated in response to cs. since these clusters represent different gene regulation mechanisms, a specific data mining work has been undertaken to identify the key functions and pathways underlined by the selected clusters.figure  <dig>

an early response to stress is represented by the activation of trans-membrane proteins acting as calcium transport channels resulting in a ca2+ flow into the cytosolic region  <cit> . in arabidopsis the calcium-binding rd <dig> protein  plays a key role in drought tolerance through stomatal control under water deficit condition  <cit> . on the genechip® wheat genome array six pss with a high sequence similarity to the rd <dig> gene are present, among them, one  was modulated by stress in the experiment here reported and exhibits an expression profile belonging to cluster  <dig> . its transcription was strongly activated in cappelli in response to hs and cs, while in ofanto it was activated only by cs . besides calcium binding activity, rd <dig> can play a role as peroxygenase in the oxylipin pathway  <cit> . oxylipins are fatty acid hydroperoxide compounds active as germination inhibitors of fungal spores  <cit>  and as modulators of plant development processes  <cit> . nevertheless, when we analyzed the expression of all genes involved in the oxylipin pathway, no differentially expressed genes in response to stress were found, suggesting that the up-regulation of rd <dig>  in our experiment, is not linked to oxylipin pathway regulation. several other genes coding for ca2+ binding proteins but without ef-hand motifs, like phospholipase d  were also found. the pld catalyzes the cleavage of membrane phospholipids into phosphatidic acid  and a soluble head group; its activity is regulated by . pa, in turn, is a second messenger implicated in plant stress signaling  <cit> , also produced by diacyl-glycerol kinase   <cit> . two pss  with high sequence similarity to arabidopsis pld  were differentially expressed with an expression profile following the one of cluster  <dig>  moreover two dag kinase  related probe sets  belonging to clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  were also differentially expressed.

another key messenger in plants is the phosphatidylinositol  that can be phosphorylated at several positions of the inositol head group. in the experiment here described, pi3k , pik  and pi4p5k  were differentially expressed and exhibited the same expression trend of cluster  <dig>  but for pik belonging to cluster  <dig>  notably, it has been reported that pi3k is required for aba-induced ros generation that leads to stomatal closure in vicia faba <cit> . overall these data suggest that the calcium-related messengers and phosphoinositide signaling are involved in the stress response and that they are more active in cappelli compared to ofanto when exposed to hs .

an increased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in epigenetic regulation has also been associated to stress response. the variations of the chromatin structure are often dependent on the expression of histone variants or on histone post-translational modifications  <cit> . the drought, heat and combined stress activate the expression of different histone variants such as histone  <dig> , histone  <dig>  , histone 2a , histone 2b , histone  <dig> , two histone deacetylases  and a histone acetyltransferase , whose expression behaviors were associated mainly to cluster  <dig>  and to some extent also to clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  moreover two regulators of chromosome condensation, rcc <dig>  and a smc2-like condensin , were differentially expressed. besides regulator of chromosome condensation genes, the wd- <dig> repeat protein , also named atmsi <dig>  was described to be involved in chromatin assembly  <cit> .the msi <dig> arabidopsis mutant exhibits an enhanced expression of many aba-responsive genes eliciting the response to drought and salt stress. alexandre et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that msi <dig> can bind to the chromatin of the drought-inducible downstream target rd <dig> suggesting for msi <dig> a role in the negative regulation of arabidopsis drought-stress response. however, in the durum wheat transcriptome analysis here reported, the up-regulation of atmsi <dig> was directly correlated to the expression of aba-responsive genes and rd <dig>  fourteen probe sets with high sequence similarity to the gene coding the wd- <dig> repeat protein  were found also by the present analysis . many of them are annotated as components of cul4-based e <dig> ubiquitin ligases  <cit> . in particular at4g <dig>   is a component of cul4-based e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, but has a pi3k activity too, and is directly involved in pi3p production  <cit> .

the analysis of the gene clusters differentially expressed between ofanto and cappelli during stress response identified also  <dig> probe sets related to proteins containing the rna recognition motif  and splicing factors. these proteins were reported to be associated to the mrna metabolism of genes involved in the aba signal transduction in arabidopsis <cit>  as well as in vicia faba <cit> . one of these proteins  is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of stomata guard cells, and it aggregates in small structures  involved in mrna storage or processing, in response to aba. moreover akip <dig> is activated through phosphorylation by aapk  and, once activated, is able for example to bind dehydrin mrnas  <cit> . in arabidopsis the aapk homolog gene  is up-regulated by aba and plays a key role in the phosphorylation events that lead to the aba and osmotic induced stomata closure . the wheat genechip® carries nine probe sets that have a sequence similarity with ost <dig>  of these, five were found to be up-regulated in durum wheat with an expression profile belonging to cluster  <dig> , cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig> . another probe set, ta. <dig> .s1_at, was identified in cluster  <dig> .

chy is a gene  coding for a β-hydroxyisobutyryl coa hydrolase  involved in the catabolism of valine and with a role in the perception and transduction of low temperature signaling  <cit> . in durum wheat four probe sets  with high sequence similarity to the chy were found in cluster  <dig>  a second gene involved in valine pathway and signal transduction was also differentially expressed; the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase  is localized in the mitochondria and catalyzes the reaction that leads to the synthesis of isobutyryl-coa, a substrate of the reaction leading to hydroxyl-isobutyrate, catalyzed by chy  <cit> . the wheat genechip® carries three probe sets with sequence similarity to bckdh, two of them  were up-regulated according to cluster  <dig> expression profile.

the more pronounced response to hs of cappelli vs ofanto was also supported by two heat-shock factors  related probe sets found in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>   whose expression promoted the up-regulation of  <dig> hsp-related probe sets exhibiting a similar expression trend and belonging to clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

overall, the analysis of the genes belonging to clusters characterized by significantly different expression profiles between cappelli and ofanto allowed the identification of a number of key components of the heat and drought signaling pathways, suggesting that the different stress response of the two cultivars is supported by a different modulation of the regulatory mechanisms .

the fatty acids β-oxidation pathway
in plants, the β-oxidation takes place mainly in peroxisomes and glyoxysomes. this pathway requires four enzymatic reactions that are repeated until the fatty acid degradation is completed  <cit> . the first reaction is catalyzed by acyl-coa ligase/synthase . there are twenty-two probe sets with high sequence similarity to the gene coding for this enzyme on the wheat genechip®; seven were differentially expressed, among these four have expression trend according to cluster  <dig> 

the activity of the acyl-coa synthase leads to the formation of acyl-coa that is converted to trans-2-enoyl-coa by acyl-coa oxidase , the true first β-oxidation enzyme  <cit> . in the array there are  <dig> probe sets exhibiting sequence similarity to the arabidopsis acyl-coa oxidase genes , four of which were differentially expressed, three  belong to cluster  <dig>  one  belongs to cluster  <dig>  the previous reaction requires the presence of fad as co-factor and o <dig> as electron acceptor; the latter is reduced to h2o <dig> that is subsequently decomposed by a peroxisome catalase . six peroxisome catalase-related probe sets were differentially expressed, four according to cluster  <dig>  and two according to cluster  <dig> .

subsequently, the trans-2-enoyl-coa undergoes a hydration reaction catalyzed by enoyl-coa hydratase  and it is transformed into the corresponding l-β-hydroxyacyl-coa; in the next step, catalyzed by the l-β-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase , the l-β-hydroxyacyl-coa is converted into β-ketoacyl-coa, this transformation requires a molecule of nad+ that is reduced to nadh. in plant peroxisomes a multi-functional protein coded by at4g <dig> is responsible for at least four activities, including the activity of enoyl-coa hydratase and l-β-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase  <cit> . two wheat probe sets  have sequence similarity to the at4g <dig> gene and they were both classified in cluster  <dig> 

the ending step of each β-oxidation cycle is the acetyl-coa detachment from the starting fatty acid, catalyzed by the acyl-coa-acetyltransferase enzyme or thiolase . one probe set  has sequence similarity with the arabidopsis thiolase gene and was induced by stress according to cluster  <dig> 

in summary, all genes involved in the fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as a corollary gene of this cycle , are activated by both hs and cs. the highest level of transcription was achieved by hs in cappelli, while in ofanto the level of transcription was much lower. the same pathway is activated in both cultivars under cs. a representation of the β-oxidation pathway with indicated variations in the expression levels of the genes coding for the key enzymes of the pathway is reported in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

the glyoxylate cycle
as β-oxidation pathway, also glyoxylate cycle occurs in peroxisomes and in glyoxysomes. in the glyoxysomes, acetyl-coa is not further oxidized to produce energy and it is used as substrate to produce sugars. the reactions that occur in this pathway are known as glyoxylate cycle. in the glyoxysome, through a β-oxidation process, the fatty acids are converted into acetyl-coa units and the reactions are catalyzed by well-known enzymes  <cit> . the expression level of the gene at3g <dig> coding the enzyme named acyl-activating enzyme  <dig> , responsible for the acetyl-coa synthesis, is described by four probe sets and, among these, one belongs to cluster  <dig>  while the other three were not differentially expressed. the first step of the glyoxylate cycle is catalyzed by the citrate synthase enzyme . on the array there are three probe sets which show a sequence similarity with arabidopsis citrate synthase gene  and, among these, one belongs to cluster  <dig>  while the other two were not differentially expressed. subsequently the citrate is converted to isocitrate by a two-step reaction catalyzed by aconitase . among the twenty probe sets with high sequence similarity to aconitase genes, only one is differentially expressed  and belongs to cluster  <dig>  the expression of the isocitrate lyase  gene  responsible for the third step of the cycle is described by the taaffx. <dig> .s1_at probe set that belongs to cluster  <dig>  there are three other different probe sets that show high sequence similarity to at3g <dig>  but they were not differentially expressed. five probe sets represent the gene  for the malate syntase  that catalyze the fourth step of the cycle. among these one  was differentially expressed and has been classified in cluster  <dig>  another  has not been assigned to any cluster, and the remaining three were not differentially expressed . the final step of glyoxylate cycle is catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase. in arabidospsis there are  <dig> genes coding malate dehydrogenases  that act in cytoplasm, mithocondria, chloroplasts and glyoxysomes. the wheat genechip® carries  <dig> probe sets and only one of them is differentially expressed  and belongs to cluster  <dig> 

similarly to the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, the glyoxylate cycle appear to be activated by hs specifically in cappelli, and by cs in both genotypes. a representation of the glyoxylate cycle illustrating the variations in the expression levels of the genes coding for the key enzymes of the pathway is reported in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

senescence marker genes
the activation of the glyoxylate cycle genes is considered a clear sign of plant cell senescence  <cit> . to study putative correlation among glyoxylate cycle activation and senescence in durum wheat, several genes, known as senescence markers  <cit> , were checked. a nac transcription factor  was already described as a gene involved in salt promoted senescence  <cit>  and in this experiment it has a cluster  <dig> expression trend. in arabidopsis the gene at3g <dig>  is a negative regulator of senescence  <cit> . the wheat genechip® has three probe sets with high sequence similarity to wrky <dig> and one of them was down-regulated with an opposite expression trend if compared to glyoxylate cycle genes. a third transcription factor involved in senescence processes  was found differentially expressed and belongs to cluster  <dig>  tanam-b <dig> and its homologs are responsible for senescence processes in wheat  <cit> .

although our data do not show a wide activation of senescence-related genes, several senescence transcription factors were clearly activated with an expression trend correlated to glyoxylate cycle and to many stress response genes, indicating the activation of early heat stress-induced senescence in cappelli.

modulation of gene expression induced by drought at tillering stage and e-qtl mapping
the comparisons of the transcriptomic data as well as the qt-clustering experiment have indicated a different strategy in the response of cappelli and ofanto to drought and heat stress at booting stage. since the difference in wue between the two cultivars is manifested constitutively through all life cycle  <cit> ,  <dig> drought responsive genes at booting stage  were also tested in drought treated plants at tillering stage. all genes confirmed their drought responsiveness in one or in both cultivars. in each cultivar,  <dig> genes induced by drought were found. the comparison of the expression level of the genes in ofanto drought vs cappelli drought highlighted  <dig> genes with a significantly higher expression level in ofanto vs cappelli , while the remaining  <dig> genes, although generally more expressed in ofanto, were not significantly different . these findings suggest that at tillering stage the response of ofanto to drought is stronger, in terms of gene expression levels, than the response of cappelli to the same condition. this results, once again, highlights the different response strategy of these two cultivars to drought conditions with a stronger molecular response in ofanto that is, to some extent, coherent with the results of the transcriptomic analysis performed at booting stage.figure  <dig>

to gain more details on these contrasting responses we have taken advantage of the genetic tools available for this couple of genotypes and we tested the possibility of mapping qtls controlling the expression level  of genes differentially expressed between the cultivars tested. the experiment was carried out using the gene corresponding to the probe set taaffx. <dig> .s1_at . at booting stage, the microarray data indicate that this gene was expressed in ofanto and up-regulated in response to all stress treatments, while an expression below the background value was detected in cappelli in all tested conditions . when the expression profile of hel has been verified in an independent experiment carried out at tillering stage in plants subjected to severe drought stress , the qrt-pcr analysis have revealed that hel is clearly expressed in both cultivar in the absence of stress  and down-regulated in response to drought treatment. nevertheless, the hel transcription level resulted to be much lower in cappelli than in ofanto , so that the fold change value of the ratio ofanto drought vs cappelli drought was 299-fold higher in ofanto with respect to cappelli . this great difference in gene expression associated to drought response was considered an ideal requirement to identify e-qtls controlling drought gene expression.

the sequence of hel transcript was obtained after “blastn” submission of the taaffx. <dig> .s1_at probe set in cerealsdb database , tigr plant transcript assemblies  and dfci wheat gene index database . a research for ortholog genome sequences in close related brachypodium and oryza species, a search for coding region detection in dna sequences using estscan as well as an analysis for protein sequence in uniprot did not provide any information about these sequences annotation and function. otherwise, alignment of these sequences detected a putative intron .

the accumulation of hel transcripts in response to drought was tested on  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  from the cross ofanto x cappelli exposed to drought at tillering stage. the expression data showed a bimodal frequency distribution in the ril population that indicates a simple genetic control of the trait . when the ofanto x cappelli genetic map, also including the marker corresponding to the hel gene, was used to perform the e-qtl analysis, a single e-qtl with a strong effect located in the telomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 6b was detected. the e-qtl showed a lod of  <dig> , with  <dig> % of the observed variability explained, and a negative additive effect was found , which indicated that the allele carried by ofanto was effective in increasing the hel expression level. notably, the e-qtl was positioned in the same chromosomal region where the hel gene was mapped , a finding suggesting that the main factor controlling hel expression might rely in the gene sequence itself.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
ofanto and cappelli: two different stress responsive strategies
the durum wheat cultivars ofanto and cappelli represent an ideal experimental system to investigate the water stress response in durum wheat. the two cultivars are characterized by a significantly different wue  <cit> , an ofanto x cappelli ril population has been implemented with a molecular marker map  <cit>  and it is currently used to map some wue-related traits  <cit> . the present work was designed to provide an additional level of knowledge on the ofanto and cappelli experimental system through a transcriptomic analysis of the molecular response to drought, heat, and a combination of both stress conditions.

the transcriptomic data highlight that ofanto activated a large set of well-known drought-related genes after drought treatment, while cappelli showed the constitutive expression of several genes that in ofanto are induced by drought and a minimal modulation of gene expression in response to stress. assuming that the extent of gene modulation  is a consequence of the stress signal perception, the same experimental conditions, determined as swc, had a different impact both on rwc and on stress signaling in cappelli and ofanto. despite the lower rwc of cappelli compared to ofanto, the former cultivar showed a minimal gene activation in response to drought. the lower stomata conductance  <cit>  and the constitutive expression of some drought-related genes might contribute to limit the effect of drought and the stress perception in cappelli which, in turn, is reflected in a minimal drought-induced gene expression.

the heat response was characterized by the remarkable induction, in cappelli only, of the genes coding for the enzymes involved in the fatty acids β-oxidation and in the glyoxylate cycle. an enzyme of the β-oxidation pathway, the thiolase , is also involved in aba signaling. jiang et al.  <cit>  have provided genetic evidence that thiolase positively regulates aba signaling, including aba-induced stomata closure in arabidopsis. overexpression of the gene coding thiolase increased biosynthesis of jasmonic acid  and accelerated dark-induced senescence of leaves; the opposite characteristics were observed in antisense transgenic lines  <cit> . the enhanced expression of the thiolase gene, together with the activation of the glyoxylate cycle genes  and with the modulation of some senescence marker genes, might suggest an early activation of the senescence and of senescence-related processes in cappelli but not in ofanto.

the combination of drought and heat stress in plants is a unique stress sharing a marginal portion of the molecular responses activated by drought and heat stress alone . this is evident in the case of the cultivar ofanto that activates  <dig> pss in response to drought stress,  <dig>  in response to heat stress and  <dig>  in response to drought and heat combined stress. however we observed the opposite phenomenon in cappelli, since it modulates  <dig> pss in response to drought stress,  <dig>  pss in response to heat stress and “only”  <dig>  in response to the drought and heat combined stress.

the great differences found in the stress response between ofanto and cappelli at transcriptomic level underline that cultivars of the same species can use different molecular strategies to cope with unfavorable climatic conditions. other examples are also known; the different level of salt-tolerance between fl <dig>  and ir <dig>  rice varieties was associated to a different expression of transcripts corresponding to cation transport proteins, involved in reducing na+ influx, and enzymes with antioxidant activity as peroxidases  <cit> ; the different heat tolerance of tam <dig>  and chinese spring  bread wheat cultivars was associated to  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the two varieties in response to heat stress  <cit> .

e-qtl analysis in young plants
many studies are available in literature about linkage mapping of genomic regions involved in the control of agronomic traits, but few are still the evidences about e-qtls . a pioneering study in this field was represented by the e-qtl analysis of cor <dig>  a cold regulated gene of wheat and barley. cor <dig> gene expression was higher in frost resistant vs susceptible cultivars and the qtl analysis identified a single e-qtl co-segregating with a frost tolerance qtl and with the cbf locus, coding key cbf transcription factors controlling the cold response  <cit> . in this study a similar approach was carried out with a drought induced gene  showing a marked difference in expression level between ofanto and cappelli exposed to drought. the expression of a gene can be controlled by a number of different factors, from epigenetic to translational level. in general, cis-acting factors, like features of promoters or introns as examples, or trans-acting factors, as transcriptional regulators or protein acting on mrna splicing, translation or stability of transcripts, can influence the accumulation of the mrna of a gene  <cit> . the fact that the analysis of hel gene expression has revealed a single e-qtl with a strong effect  coincident with the hel locus strongly suggests that the main factor controlling its expression relies in the gene sequence itself. otherwise, if a trans-acting factor is somehow involved, we can conclude that it is located in the same genomic locus of the hel gene. however, the transcription profiles of  <dig> double haploid wheat lines using the affymetrix genechip® wheat genome array have revealed the putative position of  <dig> genes identified as major e-qtls on single-chromosomal regions  <cit> .

some qtls for traits related to grain yield in dry environments were previously identified in the region of the e-qtl found in this study, based on molecular markers in common with published genetic maps  <cit> . since large parts of the wheat genome are covered with qtls for drought-related traits, a genetic association between a qtl and an e-qtl is not sufficient to infer for a role of the gene in drought tolerance, but it can represent an indication to be tested with further experiments.

the mapping of the e-qtl controlling hel gene expression, together with other experiments here reported, provides clear evidences that the genetic system based on cappelli and ofanto represents an ideal tool for the genetic dissection of the molecular response to drought and other abiotic stresses.
