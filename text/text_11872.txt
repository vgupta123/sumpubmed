BACKGROUND
radiation hybrid  mapping has proved to be a powerful tool for establishing marker order across a number of species  <cit> . the advantage of rh mapping over other mapping approaches such as linkage maps is that rh mapping does not require polymorphic markers, therefore increasing the number of loci potentially mapped.

in  <dig>  everts-van der wind et al.  <cit>  published the most comprehensive bovine whole genome radiation hybrid map including a total of  <dig> markers on  <dig> chromosomes. since then, two other genome wide rh maps  <cit>  with additional markers have been released confirming the usefulness of rh maps. considering that linkage maps are only useful when there is recombination between markers, a higher resolution rh panel provides the means to order closely linked markers. in addition, rh maps can be used either as scaffolds for correct genome assembly or for identifying and resolving misassembled regions of the genome sequence  <cit> . currently, there are four whole genome radiation hybrid panels available in cattle  <cit> , with the highest resolution  developed by rexroad et al.  <cit> .

the increased availability of markers has led to the development of new methods for rh data analysis and map construction. the comparative mapping approach, a newly incorporated algorithm in carthagene  <cit> , takes advantage of the information already available for a particular genome assembly, building more robust maps than the traditional approach. using simulated data, less than 10% of the markers were wrongly positioned using the comparative mapping approach, while 33% of incorrectly positioned markers were observed using the traditional rh approach  <cit> . the traditional rh approach relies on heuristic methods resulting in framework maps that include only a small portion of all the markers   <cit> . on the other hand, the comparative mapping approach extends the usual statistical model describing the rh data  <cit>  by adding a non-uniform prior distribution on the possible orders. overall, the comparative mapping approach exploits the knowledge of a completely sequenced genome containing markers that have orthologous relationships with markers genotyped through the rh panel  <cit> .

our study uses this new mapping algorithm to build a high resolution radiation hybrid map of bovine chromosome  <dig>  comparing specific discrepancies between our map and the latest sequence assembly. the identification of the correct order of markers on a specific chromosome is essential to the research community. specifically, the large number of carcass fatness quantitative trait loci  on bta <dig>  <cit>  makes it a prime target for fine scale mapping.

RESULTS
radiation hybrid map
a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers were mapped to bovine chromosome  <dig> using the  <dig> k rad bovine whole genome radiation panel  <cit> . the majority of the snp markers are derived from the bovine sequence database  <cit> . twenty-four had been previously mapped using the  <dig> k panel,  <dig> are from unmapped bac end sequences  and  <dig> are from within genes known to be on bta <dig>  the rh map obtained has a log10-likelihood of - <dig> , with a total length of  <dig>  centirays  and an average marker spacing of  <dig> kbp. the average retention frequency for all the markers mapped to bta <dig> was 18%, with  <dig> unique retention patterns . a list of all mapped markers and their respective rh positions and genotypes are given in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

alignment with rh <dig>  bta <dig> map
there are  <dig> common markers between the high resolution bta <dig> map presented here and the bta <dig> rh <dig>  map described in mckay et al.  <cit> . overall, there is a high consistency in marker order, except for two regions where closely mapped markers are inverted . the first inconsistency is comprised of markers scaffold105570_ <dig>  scaffold230838_ <dig>  scaffold135027_ <dig>  scaffold135027_ <dig> and bes9_contig292_ <dig>  in our map, their positions range from  <dig>  to  <dig> cr. the other region involves three flanking markers showing an inversion in their positions: scaffold40049_ <dig> at  <dig>  cr, bes7_contig136_ <dig> at  <dig>  cr and bes3_contig324_ <dig> at  <dig>  cr

alignment with bovine sequence assembly 
of the  <dig> markers mapped,  <dig> had multiple hits on different chromosomes when compared to the bovine sequence assembly  using blast. most of these hits occurred between bta <dig> and an unassigned chromosome with similar blast scores . there are several regions of discrepancies between our bta <dig> rh map and the bovine sequence assembly  . a major region of inconsistency is near the centromere with smaller regions throughout the chromosome showing flips between sets of markers. overall, the inconsistencies can be summarized by:

a) single markers or group of closely mapped markers mapping somewhere else in the bovine sequence assembly. ie: bta- <dig> and bta- <dig> to bta-86950

b) inversion of flanking markers. ie: bta- <dig> and bta-34555

c) inversion of closely mapped markers. ie: bta- <dig> to bta-06606

all inversions between closely mapped markers were analyzed and suggest incorrectly ordered scaffolds. the first case is represented by markers bta- <dig>  and bta- <dig> . in both maps, these markers map close together, however in our rh map, marker bta- <dig> maps before marker bta- <dig>  according to the assembly these markers are approximately  <dig>  base pairs away. the log10-likelihood for our order is - <dig> , while the assembly's order log10-likelihood is - <dig> . the second case showed problems in the arrangement within scaffolds. markers bta- <dig>  and bta- <dig>  show a flip in their positions when compared to the sequence assembly. the log10-likelihood for the assembly, in this case, is - <dig> , while the log10-likelihood for our order is still - <dig> . both markers are part of the same scaffold indicating a possible mis-assembly within the scaffold.

the inconsistencies observed between our rh map and the assembly cannot be resolved by comparing previously published maps since there are no other maps of bta <dig> with a comparable resolution. a complete list of markers showing inconsistent locations when compared to btau_ <dig>  is presented in additional file  <dig> 

alignment with human chromosome 8
of the  <dig> markers ordered on the map,  <dig> markers  have putative orthologs on the human chromosome  <dig>  . comparative analysis between bovine chromosome  <dig> and human chromosome  <dig> identified  <dig> homologous conserved synteny blocks : three previously published  <cit>  and an extra conserved synteny block close to the telomere . this additional hsb block is comprised of  <dig> markers  and lies in a region with high consistency between our rh map and the assembly, therefore confirming the identification of a new evolutionary breakpoint. a number of gaps from a previous published map  <cit>  have been filled and  <dig> small inversions identified. these inversions were predicted using a set of rules described by murphy et al.  <cit> .

when two or more markers mapped to the same location, their relative positions were decided using a combination of their bovine assembly and human chromosome  <dig> coordinates, with the bovine coordinates taking precedence over the human ones. in this case, the human coordinates were used to determine whether or not markers appeared in ascending or descending order, depending on which hsb they were in. once a particular trend was observed, their relative positions were established based on the bovine sequence assembly; meaning that markers were arranged sequentially in an either ascending or descending trend, even if there were disagreements with the human coordinates. for example, according to their human coordinates, the order of the four markers mapping to position  <dig>  cr should be bta- <dig>  bta- <dig>  bta- <dig> and bta- <dig>  however according to their assembly coordinates, bta- <dig> precedes bta- <dig> making the order of all four markers sequential . comparative analysis between the bovine sequence assembly and hsa <dig> resulted in more hsbs than expected .

discussion
comparison with other maps and btau_ <dig> 
in this study a comprehensive bta <dig> rh map was built using the bovine assembly information  as a reference order. traditionally, lod scores have been used to determine the best fit map; however as the number of markers increases, it becomes more difficult to establish the next best map solely on the basis of these lod scores. in the comparative method, the best map is a compromise between the rh data and the assembly and it works by comparing the likelihoods and breakpoints for the different maps. briefly, if two maps have the same likelihood but different breakpoints, the order with fewer breakpoints is preferable. this approach demonstrates extreme robustness when building dense maps, as shown on simulated data and the dog genome  <cit> .

comparison between our map and the previously released  <dig> k rh bta <dig> map  <cit>  demonstrated a high degree of consistency except for regions where markers were in close proximity. in our map, those markers still map close to each other but with some slight shifts in order, particularly when the positions were just a few centirays apart. perhaps the resolution of the  <dig> k panel was not adequate for determining the order for those closely linked markers, since the number of cell lines for this panel is lower  than in the  <dig> k panel .

previously released radiation hybrid maps  <cit>  have indicated regions that are inconsistent with the bovine sequence assembly. according to jann et al.  <cit> , bta <dig> was not among the chromosomes with a high number of discrepancies with the assembly . the inconsistencies observed referred mainly to the assignment of markers to other chromosomes. such inconsistency still occurred in the latest assembly, but it was most likely due to repeated sequences assigned to multiple chromosomes. mckay et al.  <cit>  also indicated incorrectly assigned markers as well as some small inversions in scaffold ordering between their rh map and btau_ <dig>  for some chromosomes; confirming that some discrepancies in scaffold arrangement were already present in previous assembly releases. table  <dig> summarizes and compares the various bta <dig> rh maps.

the vast number of markers made available through the bovine sequencing initiative has made possible the compilation of very closely linked markers. however, it is recognized that even this latest assembly contains a possible 20% error in scaffold assembly , with no reports on the specific error rates for the scaffolds discussed here. mammalian genomes are characterized by large duplications and abundant repetitive sequences which can complicate the final assembly  <cit> . finishing a genome does not necessarily indicate that the mis-assemblies will be resolved. it only means that the gaps are closed but that the sequence itself is not confirmed  <cit> . software limitations in assembling large, repeated sequences can cause incorrect ordering of large segments of dna  <cit> .

differences in the animal resources used to produce the rh map and the bovine assembly for bta <dig> seem unlikely to be the cause of the discrepancies discussed here. for instance, a high similarity in marker order should be expected between the genome of the line-bred hereford bull represented in the bac map and the genome of his daughter, which was used for the assembly. the pedigree relationship between this sire and daughter is  <dig>  . however, comparisons between the bac map, the  <dig> k bta <dig> rh map and the assembly showed that the highest agreement is between the bac map and the rh map , with the latter panel being constructed from an angus bull  fibroblast cells  <cit> . based on this and the fact that the likelihood for our best map is substantially higher  than the likelihood for the assembly order , the notion that the differences we observed are due to rearrangement of individual animal's genomes seems unlikely.

the ultimate map for a species is the correctly assembled genome sequence with the latest assembly having a  <dig>  fold-coverage. the bovine sequence assembly used the whole genome shotgun sequencing approach as well as information from a minimum tiling path of bac clones across the genome. contigs, which are referred to as the basic units of contiguous bases, are linked together using information from read pairs at the end of clones. linked contigs will form scaffolds which are, in turn, arranged along the chromosome using mapping information from marc  <dig>  <cit>  map. therefore the observed error rate in scaffold arrangement for the assembly is most likely due to the error rate observed in the marc  <dig> linkage map.

a combination of multiple mapping approaches such as linkage and rh maps have demonstrated their feasibility for improving the assembly  <cit> . a number of mapping approaches have aided the arrangement of scaffolds from the first release of the assembly until now  <cit> . certain high resolution maps such as the one of bta <dig> published by weikard et al.  <cit>  presented a gene based comparative radiation hybrid map providing a platform for the assembly. all of these studies have contributed considerable information to the assembly, but mis-assemblies and inconsistencies are still present.

comparison with human chromosome  <dig> 
as the density of markers increases, new hsbs and evolutionary breakpoints are likely to be identified through comparative studies. previously reported hsbs from an independent study  <cit>  are in overall agreement with those reported here. the new hsb identified in our map is supported since marker order in this region is highly consistent with the assembly order  <cit> . the number of inversions observed in our map  was higher than the number identified by a previous bta <dig> map   <cit> . this is not surprising considering the increase in marker density. this increase in marker density coupled with certain limitations of the panel prevented some markers from mapping to unique positions, but by consolidating the human coordinates with the bovine assembly positions for these rh markers with the same position, it was possible to reduce the number of inversions from  <dig> to  <dig>  a comparative genome assembly approach uses the information from a reference genome to build and arrange the sequenced genome  <cit> . therefore, using the high resolution rh map built here in addition to the cattle-human comparative maps already available, it should be possible to resolve rearrangements in the bovine genome assembly.

CONCLUSIONS
with the bovine genome assembly now publicly available, attention has turned from marker discovery towards the proper ordering of these markers. since the release of early assembly versions, significant improvements have been made through the resolution of mis-assemblies. the integration of different mapping approaches will continue to supply information that can be used to refine the genome sequence. more accurate maps and assemblies will facilitate accurate positioning of qtl affecting economically important traits, haplotype map construction and positional candidate gene searches.

using high resolution maps, such as the one described in this work, it is possible to identify regions of the bovine genome sequence that can potentially be improved. it is important to acknowledge that all mapping approaches have weaknesses, and that discrepancies between maps are best resolved using information from a variety of sources, such as cattle-human comparative maps or additional sequencing. through the data presented and discussed here we hope to aid in the generation of subsequent bovine genome assemblies.
