BACKGROUND
lipoprotein lipase  is responsible for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in plasma lipoproteins, generating fatty acids and monoglycerides for uptake in tissues and use in metabolic processes
 <cit> . lpl is synthesized and secreted by parenchymal cells such as adipocytes and myocytes, but the enzyme acts at the luminal face of endothelial cells in capillaries where it is anchored to the plasma membrane in a heparin-releasable manner. the mechanism by which lpl is transported from the interstitial spaces surrounding parenchymal cells into capillaries involves an endothelial cell protein, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein  <dig> , that binds lpl at the basolateral surface of capillaries and transports it into the capillary lumen
 <cit> . in the absence of gpihbp <dig>  lpl is mislocalized to the subendothelial spaces, resulting in severe hypertriglyceridemia
 <cit> . two structural motifs within gpihbp <dig> are important for its ability to bind lpl. mutations within one of the motifs have been identified in patients with severe chylomicronemia
 <cit> . recently it was demonstrated that the transendothelial transport of lpl is bidirectional
 <cit> .

lpl is found in large amounts in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, but it is also present in kidneys, lungs, fetal liver, lactating mammary gland and macrophages, as well as in scattered cells of the brain
 <cit> . in addition, lpl is found in the islets of langerhans
 <cit> . in ins- <dig> cells , high glucose levels stimulate the activity of lpl both in total cell extracts and in the heparin-releasable fractions of lpl that is secreted and associated to the cell surfaces
 <cit> . the function of beta cell-derived lpl is unknown, but the stimulation by glucose of lpl activity suggests that it may contribute to beta cell function  by increasing delivery of lipids to the islets. acute exposure of islets to fatty acids potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
 <cit> , but chronic exposure causes impaired insulin responses and beta cell death
 <cit> . in other tissues the expression and activity of lpl is regulated by nutritional and hormonal factors
 <cit> . lpl activity is usually affected by insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity, although the mechanisms are not fully resolved. the aim here was to study the relative distribution of lpl and its endothelial transport protein gpihbp <dig> in mouse pancreas, and to study effects on lpl and gpihbp <dig> expression in pancreas by changes in nutritional state , diet composition  and by obesity due to leptin deficiency.

methods
reagents and buffers
phosphate buffered saline  was  <dig>  m nacl containing  <dig>  m na2hpo <dig> and  <dig>  m nah2po <dig> . tbst buffer consisted of  <dig> mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m nacl, and  <dig> %  triton x- <dig>  paraformaldehyde   was diluted in  <dig>  m pbs ph  <dig>  to a final concentration of 4%. sucrose for fixation of tissues was from bdh , and the tissue mounting media tissue tek  <dig> was from sakura finetek. the antibodies were diluted in 10%  heat-inactivated fetal calf serum  from invitrogen. tbst was also used for washing of the slides. the sections were mounted in vectasheild mounting medium for fluorescence . dalteparin sodium   <dig> ie/ky anti-xa/ml, a low molecular weight heparin, was from pharmacia. glass slides  and cover slips were from menzel-gläser .

animals and procedures
wild-type  male mice , six weeks of age, were fed a chow diet   <dig>  sds). c57bl/ <dig> embryos were harvested at eighteen days of gestation , and the pancreas was removed for immunofluorescence. some mice were treated with fragmin®  <dig> ie , administered intraperitoneally , and sacrificed  <dig> minutes later. the animals were on a 12-hours light/dark cycle with free access to water, unless otherwise stated. all animal procedures were approved by the regional ethical committee on studies involving animal experiments, umeå, sweden and the corresponding columbia university’s institutional animal care and use committee.

mice on high fat diet, fasted and re-fed
two groups of three-month-old c57bl/ <dig> male mice,  <dig> in each group, were included in the experiment. one group was given regular pellets  and the other group was given a high fat diet  for  <dig> days . food was then removed at  <dig> p.m. and the animals were fasted overnight. in the morning food was given back to five animals in the hfd-group and  <dig> animals in the control group and they were re-fed for  <dig> hours before sacrifice. the remaining  <dig> animals in each group stayed fasted during the corresponding time.

mice fed a diet rich in saturated fatty acids  for  <dig> weeks
four-weeks old male c57bl/ <dig> mice were fed a hfd containing predominantly saturated fat  or a control, low fat, diet  with compositions as detailed previously for  <dig> weeks
 <cit> . in this experiment the animals were fasted for 2hours before fixation by perfusion of the whole body. then the pancreases were taken out and treated as described for the other animals. we examined  <dig> pancreases from the sat-group and  <dig> from the chow group.

ob/ob mice
ob/ob mice lack leptin
 <cit> . they were taken from a local colony . the ob/ob genotype was identified by rapid increase in body weight and rise in blood glucose levels compared to the healthy siblings. all mice  were fed standard pellets high in carbohydrates . the youngest mice were  <dig>  and  <dig>  weeks old when sacrificed . in addition we examined  <dig> pancreases each from three and nine months old ob/ob mice obtained at two different experimental occasions. ob/ob mice from the rolf luft research center for diabetes and endocrinology, karolinska institutet, stockholm, sweden  were used for qpcr on age related lpl expression .

treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin
ob/ob mice used for the leptin experiment were six months of age, and all were females. in one set of experiments,  <dig> animals were given leptin for  <dig> days, while  <dig> were given  <dig>  m nacl. in another set,  <dig> animals were treated with leptin and  <dig> used as controls. leptin or vehicle was injected i.p. twice every day for  <dig> days. the starting concentration was  <dig>  μg leptin/g body weight. after  <dig> days the concentration was reduced to  <dig>  μg leptin/g for  <dig> days and finally  <dig>  μg/g was given for the remaining  <dig> days. body weight and food intake were measured on a daily basis. blood glucose  was measured during leptin treatment. the mice had free access to water and food, standard pellets .

isolation of islets
ob/ob mice were sacrificed after anesthesia and the pancreas was dissected out. six ob/ob mice were leptin treated and  <dig> were used as controls. age and sex-matched  c57bl/ <dig>  was used for comparison. the pancreas was placed in collagenase solution  and shaken for  <dig> minutes at 37°c. a krebs - ringer medium buffer was used with the following composition in mm:  <dig> nacl,  <dig>  kcl,  <dig>  kh2po <dig>   <dig>  mgso <dig> and  <dig>  cacl <dig> and supplemented with  <dig> mg/ml bsa and  <dig> mm d-glucose. the medium was buffered with  <dig> mm hepes and naoh to reach ph  <dig> . islets were picked, counted, placed in buffer rlt from qiagen and frozen at −80°c.

real-time pcr
rna was extracted from isolated islets and dnase treated using an rneasy micro kit from qiagen . cdna was prepared from  <dig> ng total rna using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, rnase h minus   and pd <dig> random hexamer  in total volume of  <dig> μl. the expression of lpl was quantified by real time pcr as previously described using maxima probe/rox qpcr master mix  and the abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system , using the same primers and probes
 <cit> . expression levels were normalized to 18s mrna using the eukaryotic18s rrna endogenous control reagent set supplied from applied biosystems. in the experiment with leptin treatment, one pancreas from a leptin treated ob/ob mouse gave low islet count for technical reasons and was discarded. another mouse in the leptin-treated group died, leaving  <dig> mice for the leptin–treated group and  <dig> mice for the untreated group.

analyses of lpl expression on isolated islets from untreated ob/ob mice were done using sybr-green with beta actin as reference gene. four mice were used in each age group, except at three months where  <dig> mice were used.

tissue preparation
for sectioning, the organs were dissected free from contaminating tissue in cold pbs and fixed in 4% pfa , at 4°c for 1– <dig> hours. the tissue pieces were then placed in 30% sucrose in  <dig>  m pbs, ph  <dig> , at 4°c overnight. the pieces were mounted in tissue tek and quickly frozen on dry ice for storage at −80°c or for direct cryosectioning .

immunofluorescence microscopy
tissue sections were first blocked with 10%  fcs in tbst for  <dig> hour at room temperature. then they were incubated overnight at 4°c with primary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution. after washing three times with tbst, secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were added and incubated for  <dig> hour at room temperature. slides were mounted in vectasheild mounting media for fluorescence . visualization of the stained sections was made with a nikon confocal microscope eclipse e <dig>  japan, with the software ez-c <dig> digital eclipse and nikon act- <dig>  the pictures were taken with magnification 10x, 40x and 60x.

antibodies
the anti-lpl antibody was raised by immunizing chickens with bovine lpl; affinity-purified igy was obtained as described
 <cit> . the batch used was diluted 1: <dig> and was the same as the one previously thoroughly investigated for specificity
 <cit> . control igy  was diluted to the same protein concentration. alexafluor 488– or alexafluor 594–labeled goat-anti-chicken antibodies from molecular probes  were diluted 1: <dig>  the endothelium was identified by staining with rat anti-pecam  antibodies from bp pharmagen  diluted 1: <dig>  and alexa fluor  <dig> goat-anti-rat . islet cells were visualized with antibodies against glucagon , insulin , somatostatin  and pp-cells. rabbit anti-glucagon from linco  was diluted 1: <dig>  and visualized with alexa fluor  <dig> or  <dig> goat-anti-rabbit from molecular probes . guinea pig-anti-insulin  was diluted 1: <dig> and visualized with alexa fluor  <dig> or  <dig> goat-anti-guinea pig antibodies from molecular probes . rat-anti-somatostatin from biogenesis  was diluted 1: <dig> and visualized with alexa fluor  <dig> goat-anti-rat. guinea pig-anti-pancreatic polypeptide from linco  was diluted 1: <dig> and visualized with alexa fluor  <dig> goat-anti-guinea pig. nuclei were stained by dapi from sigma . the gpihbp <dig> antibody was raised in a rabbit against recombinant mouse gpihbp <dig>  expressed in e. coli <cit> . an immunoglobulin fraction was purified on a 6his-gpihbp1-sepharose column, used at  <dig> μg/ml and visualized with alexa fluor goat-anti-rabbit  <dig> or  <dig>  monoclonal rat-anti-mouse gpihbp <dig>   diluted 1: <dig> was visualized with alexa fluor  <dig> goat-anti-rat.

statistics
data was normalized and presented as mean ± sem . statistical analysis was performed using graph pad prism  <dig> 

RESULTS
lpl in endocrine pancreas
most of the cells in the islets of langerhans were stained by the anti lpl antibody, but some cells were more fluorescent than others . with antibodies to insulin, co-localization with lpl was evident in most cells in the center of the islets , while cells in the periphery stained only for lpl. with antibodies to glucagon, co-localization with lpl was seen in cells with the peripheral distribution pattern typical for alpha cells . no staining for lpl was seen in the less abundant delta or pp cells .

lpl in embryonic mice at stage e <dig> and antibody specificity
it is known that alpha cells tend to show autofluorescence due to their high content of granulae. to investigate whether lpl is really expressed in alpha cells we studied staining for lpl, insulin and glucagon in embryonic pancreases at stage e <dig> when the alpha cells have not yet developed secretory granules. immunofluorescence for lpl was seen connected to both beta and alpha cells . the staining for glucagon was weaker than for insulin, but co-staining was visible between glucagon and lpl also at this early stage. this finding supported the results from the adult mice indicating that lpl is expressed both in alpha and beta cells.

lpl and gpihbp <dig> in exocrine pancreas
next we wanted to exclude the possibility that the staining for lpl was non-specific. therefore control experiments were made with pre-immune igy , with only secondary antibodies, or with adsorption of the anti-lpl igy with purified bovine lpl. compared to the results with anti-lpl igy, there was little or no fluorescence in either islets or the exocrine pancreas with any of the tested antibodies . in contrast, the positive staining for lpl in exocrine pancreatic tissue with anti-lpl igy was localized to capillaries, as evidenced by co-localization with the endothelial marker cd <dig> .

to investigate whether the immune-reactive lpl was heparin-releasable, mice were first injected with low molecular weight heparin 
 <cit> , and were then sacrificed  <dig> minutes later for studies of lpl in pancreas. compared to mice that had not been given fragmin®, much of the lpl immune-reactivity had disappeared from capillaries and small blood vessels of the exocrine pancreas in the fragmin®-treated mice , while the staining for cd <dig> remained associated with the endothelium, as expected . a lower magnification  demonstrated that in the islets the staining for lpl was not much changed in fragmin®-treated animals compared to non-treated animals. the resistance to fragmin® indicated that lpl was mostly localized within islets cells. this is in contrast to lpl in exocrine pancreas that was heparin-releasable and therefore presumably exposed on endothelial cell surfaces.

immunostaining for gpihbp <dig>  was associated with capillaries and small vessels in exocrine pancreas  in a pattern similar to that seen with the anti lpl antibodies . the staining for gpihbp <dig> co-localized with the staining for cd <dig> . in accord with previous findings in other tissues
 <cit>  gpihbp <dig> was mostly seen within the smallest blood vessels, but was not present in larger ones. as expected, mice treated with fragmin® showed the same staining pattern for gpihbp <dig> in exocrine pancreas as untreated animals . co-localization between lpl and gpihbp <dig> was seen in many of the small blood vessels in the exocrine pancreas and also in the islets vessels .

lpl in pancreas of ob/ob mice and leptin-treated ob/ob mice
islets in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are known to be enlarged and to produce increased amounts of insulin
 <cit> . we studied lpl in pancreas of ob/ob mice at five weeks and at three, six or nine months of age. in contrast to what was seen in control mice, there were almost no lpl-positive cells in the center of the islets and only scattered lpl-positive cells in the periphery of the islets  at three, six and nine months. most of the scattered cells stained positively also for glucagon  and hence were presumably alpha cells. the beta cells in ob/ob mice stained for insulin, but not for lpl . in five weeks old ob/ob mice the islets were smaller than at the older ages, but the pattern for lpl distribution was similar to that in three, six and nine months old animals . to study if lpl in the islets was intracellular, or associated with endothelial cells in capillaries, islets from wt and ob/ob mice were stained with antibodies to cd <dig> and lpl . co-localization was seen between lpl and cd <dig>  but in wt mice the majority of lpl was intracellular in alpha and beta cells. in ob/ob mice islets there was very little lpl staining. some of the immune-reactivity co-localized with extracellular cd <dig> and the rest with intracellular glucagon.

to investigate whether it was possible to reverse the aberrant pattern for lpl reactivity in islets of ob/ob mice towards the pattern seen in wt mice, ob/ob mice were treated with daily injections of leptin for  <dig> days. during this time the treated animals ate less, probably due to the anorectic effect of leptin, and their body weight and plasma glucose levels decreased . after treatment with leptin for  <dig> days, immunofluorescence for lpl was again found in islet beta cells . the expression pattern differed from islet to islet. some islets had recovered almost completely, while others stained for lpl mostly in alpha cells and only in a few beta cells. ob/ob mice in the control group ate more than the leptin-treated group, but still lost some weight, probably due to that they were somewhat disturbed by the daily i.p. injections of saline . they did not show any lpl expression in their beta cells. immune-reaction for lpl was visible in alpha cells in the saline-injected group , just like in ob/ob mice at all ages studied. exocrine tissue of ob/ob mice stained for lpl in the same way as that of wt mice, showing co-localization of lpl and cd <dig> . lean control mice, from the same colony, had a mean weight of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g and blood glucose levels of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l .

the table demonstrates weight, food intake and glucose levels in ob/ob mice treated with leptin or saline for  <dig> days. the mice were used for immunofluorescence . all glucose values are from non-fasted animals.

in another comparable experiment mrna expression analyses were performed on isolated islets. values from leptin-treated and untreated ob/ob mice, compared to wt mice, for blood glucose, weight and food intake are presented in table 
 <dig>  lpl mrna expression was found in both wt and ob/ob islets; however, the level of lpl mrna was significantly lower in islets of saline-injected ob/ob mice than in islets from wt mice . this was consistent with the low or absent immunofluorescence found for lpl in beta cells in ob/ob mice. leptin treatment for  <dig> days tended to increase the mrna level for lpl in the islets, but the increase did not reach statistical significance . there was no significant difference  in the mrna-levels for lpl in islets from young ob/ob mice compared to older ob/ob mice . the largest difference was seen between three and eleven months with a p-value of  <dig> . the mean glucose level in control wt mice was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l .

the table demonstrates weight, food intake and glucose levels in ob/ob mice treated with leptin or saline for  <dig> days. the mice were used for determination of mrna levels by qpcr. all glucose values are from non-fasted animals.

effects of high fat diet for  <dig> days and  <dig> weeks in wt mice
in other tissues than pancreas, both lpl and gpihbp <dig> are known to be affected by nutritional and/or hormonal factors
 <cit> . to investigate possible nutritional effects on the distribution of lpl and gpihbp <dig> in pancreas we studied wt mice that had been on high fat diet  for  <dig> days and compared them to mice on normal chow. half of the total number of animals in each group  was sacrificed after overnight fasting, and the other half was re-fed for  <dig> hours before they were sacrificed. after the different diets there was no difference in blood glucose levels between the ones on hfd for  <dig> days and the ones on chow diet, but the hfd group weighed  <dig> g more than the chow group . investigation of their pancreas showed no obvious difference in lpl between the re-fed and the fasted animals or between the ones on hfd for  <dig> days compared to those on chow diet . next we investigated pancreases from mice fed a diet high in saturated fatty acids  for  <dig> weeks, rendering them hyperlipidemic with regard to plasma triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids 
 <cit> , and slightly hyperglycemic  compared to mice on normal chow for the same time. a somewhat weaker signal for lpl was seen in the islets from animals on sat diet compared to animals fed chow diet for  <dig> weeks, but the differences were not clear enough to be conclusive . the staining for lpl was still mostly in beta cells, both in the sat-fed mice and in the control mice on chow . in both groups the staining for lpl and cd <dig> in the exocrine parts appeared comparable.

the immune-reaction for gpihbp <dig> was similar in islets from the fasted and re-fed mice fed a regular diet , and also in those fed a high fat diet for  <dig> days . the distribution of the immune-reactivity for gpihbp <dig> was comparable to the staining for vessels by anti-cd <dig> . there was no obvious effect on this pattern or intensity after  <dig> weeks on a diet high in saturated fats . in ob/ob mice treated with or without leptin the fluorescence intensity for gpihbp <dig> was somewhat increased in the islets . the capillaries and small vessels containing gpihbp <dig> appeared wider than in wt mice and this was similar to what was seen with anti-cd <dig> in islets of ob/ob mice . in exocrine pancreatic tissue, no effects were seen on the distribution or intensity of gpihbp <dig> immune-reactivity by nutritional status, diet or leptin deficiency .

discussion
a major new finding in this study is that the expression of lpl in pancreatic beta cells is suppressed in ob/ob mice. while there was strong immunostaining for lpl in beta cells from normal mice, there was virtually no staining in beta cells from obese and leptin deficient ob/ob mice. this suggests that leptin has an important role for the expression of lpl in beta cells. ob/ob mice eat constantly and become obese, insulin resistant and hyperglycemic. to cope with this they develop islet hyperplasia, and in addition the ob/ob mice have a higher proportion of beta cells in their islets than wt mice 
 <cit> . in contrast to humans with diabetes type  <dig> due to insufficient insulin secretion
 <cit> , the beta cells of ob/ob mice have normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and produce large amounts of insulin
 <cit> . we found that supplementation of ob/ob mice for  <dig> days with leptin reduced food intake, body weight and blood glucose levels, and restored lpl-expression in the beta cells. some islets were almost completely restored, while others had only started to recover lpl expression at this time. lpl mrna levels responded in a similar way. they were lower in ob/ob compared to wt mice, and tended to increase in ob/ob mice after leptin treatment. the lack of lpl in beta cells of ob/ob mice could be due to the lack of leptin per se, or could be a consequence of obesity and/or the high levels of glucose, fatty acids and insulin in the blood. a similar response to leptin had been described for hormone sensitive lipase  in ob/ob mice. after  <dig> days with leptin injections there was increased immunostaining for hsl in islets
 <cit> . leptin is known to affect lpl in other tissues. in skeletal muscle, but not in adipose tissue, an increase in lpl activity is seen both in wt and ob/ob mice after leptin injections
 <cit> . leptin also affects expression of lpl in j <dig> macrophages
 <cit> . taken together, these observations imply an important role for leptin in modulation of the lpl system, and hence in lipoprotein metabolism.

it is known that leptin affects alpha and beta cells through the leptin receptor obr and that this leads to inhibited insulin and glucagon secretion
 <cit> . pancreas-specific obr −/− mice show no difference in body weight, food intake or percentage of body fat compared to control mice, while differences are seen in blood insulin concentrations and response to glucose
 <cit> . like ob/ob mice, the pancreas-specific obr −/− mice develop islet hyperplasia due to increased beta-cell mass. this animal model could be used to investigate whether islet lpl, and hsl, are affected by the local lack of leptin signaling, or by the general metabolic disturbances seen in the ob/ob mice.

lpl has previously been shown to be expressed in beta cells and to be closely linked to the function of these cells
 <cit> . both beta cell-specific overexpression of lpl, and deletion of lpl in beta cells, resulted in a diabetic phenotype
 <cit> . overexpression of lpl in beta cells decreased islet glucose metabolism, while beta cell-specific knock-out of lpl increased islet glucose metabolism. it is therefore likely that optimal beta cell function requires a delicate balance between metabolism of glucose and fatty acids. in the normal situation, some of the fatty acids may be provided by the lpl system, in addition to the fatty acids that arrive from adipose tissue as albumin-bound nefas and fatty acids released from intracellular islet stores by adipose tissue triglyceride lipase  and hsl
 <cit> . the intracellular localization of lpl within alpha and beta cells, rather than on the capillary endothelium in the islets, demonstrate that only a minor fraction of the synthesized lpl is secreted from these cells and argues against a function of lpl in lipid uptake by the islet cells. lpl is present in vesicles separate from the insulin-containing granulae in ins <dig> cells and it was proposed that glucose stimulates lpl translocation to the cell surface
 <cit> . the expression of lpl in ins <dig> cells has been shown to be up-regulated by agonists to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta and by cytokines that induce expression of this receptor
 <cit> . we thought that the predominant intracellular localization of lpl in islets could be due to a relative lack of the endothelial lpl-binding protein gpihbp <dig>  this was not the case. gpihbp <dig> was found to be associated with capillaries and smaller vessels both in exocrine pancreas, and in islets. as expected, immune-reaction for gpihbp <dig> was co-localized with the endothelial marker cd <dig> and also with lpl. in islets from ob/ob mice the immune-reaction for gpihbp <dig> appeared somewhat stronger and the capillaries somewhat wider than in wt mice. after leptin treatment for  <dig> days, lpl expression was restored in beta cells, but the expression pattern for gpihbp <dig> remained the same as in untreated mice, possibly due to that the islets were still enlarged.

an important argument against an involvement of lpl in insulin secretion is that insulin-dependent diabetes is not a commonly reported problem in animal models of lpl deficiency
 <cit> , or in patients with either total lpl deficiency or with non-functional lpl protein
 <cit> . in one study on human lpl-deficient subjects, enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after an oral glucose tolerance test was found, compared to other groups of non-diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia
 <cit> . islets from lpl-deficient mice were reported to secrete more insulin than islets from normal mice, and the lpl-deficient mice had lower fasting blood glucose levels and no signs of abnormal insulin responsiveness
 <cit> . with age, lpl-deficient mice were found to display glucose intolerance and decreased first-phase insulin secretion
 <cit> . thus, a direct effect of lpl on insulin secretion is unlikely, but secondary effects of lpl deficiency on insulin secretion, showing up when the metabolism is in some way challenged, cannot be excluded.

it is well known that the expression of both lpl and gpihbp <dig> is regulated by nutritional and hormonal factors. for lpl the adaptation to feeding or fasting occurs mostly by posttranslational mechanism
 <cit> , while the transcription of gpihbp <dig> is upregulated on fasting through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
 <cit> . we studied the response of lpl and gpihbp <dig> expression in pancreas of mice exposed to a high fat diet for  <dig> days or  <dig> weeks, respectively. the latter group showed increased plasma nefa and hypertriglyceridemia, indicating insulin resistance
 <cit> , while such changes were not yet evident after  <dig> days on hfd. there were no obvious differences in the lpl distribution pattern in islets of these two groups of diet-treated mice compared to littermates on normal chow. in the  <dig> day experiment we looked for rapid nutritional effects by comparing lpl distribution in pancreas from fasted mice to those re-fed for  <dig> hours after fasting. neither the hfd nor the control groups showed any significant changes in lpl distribution pattern in response to fasting. this was also the case for mice fed a diet containing a high proportion of saturated fat  for  <dig> weeks. we conclude that expression and distribution of lpl in mouse pancreatic tissue appears relatively robust with respect to nutritional state and to metabolic disturbances connected to obesity and insulin resistance. a similar conclusion was reached for the expression and distribution of gpihbp <dig>  but in ob/ob mice with or without leptin treatment there is an increase in islet vessel gpihbp <dig>  this followed the vessel structure in the ob/ob islets, which was larger than in islets of wt mice. after leptin treatment for  <dig> days lpl expression returned in beta cells, but the gpihbp <dig> pattern remained the same as in un-treated mice.

in the exocrine pancreatic tissue lpl appeared to co-localize with the endothelial marker cd <dig> and with gpihbp <dig>  the function of lpl in exocrine pancreas is not known, but the enzyme is likely to provide the acinar cells with lipolysis products for energy production to support synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes. in contrast to lpl in islet cells, lpl in exocrine pancreas disappeared after injection of fragmin®, demonstrating that most of the lpl in exocrine pancreas is localized on cell surfaces in a heparin-releasable manner. this supports the view that the main function of lpl in exocrine pancreas is to act on the triglyceride-rich plasma lipoproteins to release fatty acids and monoglycerides for uptake in the tissue. as expected, gpihbp <dig>  which is linked to plasma membranes of endothelial cell via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor
 <cit> , remained at the endothelium after fragmin® treatment. the source of lpl in pancreatic exocrine tissue is presently not known. we did not see much immunoreaction for lpl over the acinar cells, indicating that they, in contrast to islets cells, secrete most of the newly synthesized lpl. if the acinar cells are not the origin of lpl, endocrine cells might provide exocrine vessels with lpl
 <cit> . in ob/ob mice lpl in exocrine pancreas was not affected by the leptin deficiency in beta cells. this argues against the hypothesis that lpl in the exocrine pancreas originates from the islets, unless most of the exocrine lpl comes from alpha cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that lpl and gpihbp <dig> are present on capillaries both in exocrine and endocrine parts of pancreas and that expression of gpihbp <dig> is not markedly dependent on either leptin or metabolic status. in islets, lpl is mostly intracellular and lpl expression in beta cells, but not in alpha cells, is dependent on leptin and can be restored after leptin-treatment of ob/ob mice. taken together with earlier studies it is clear that lpl is present within insulin-producing cells, but further studies will be needed to understand its regulation and function.
