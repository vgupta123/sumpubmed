BACKGROUND
antibody-secreting cells , plasmablasts and plasma cells, play a pivotal role in immunological protection, and thus, are studied intensely in the fields of basic humoral immunity, vaccine development, and monoclonal antibody engineering  <cit> . the ensemble of secreted serum antibodies, igg representing the predominant isotype  <cit> , constitutes the highly diverse polyclonal antibody repertoire capable of recognizing and specifically binding to many different antigens. primary antibody heavy chain diversity is achieved by the stochastic rearrangement of three exons   <cit> ; additional secondary diversification can occur in activated b-cells via somatic hypermutation of the variable  region. antibody-specificity is believed to be dominated by the junctional site of vdj recombination, also known as the complementarity determining region  <dig>   <cit> . the cdr <dig> has thus served for a long time as a natural identifier of antibody clonality. however, it has recently been suggested that antibody specificity is a result of the close interplay of different parts of the entire vdj region  <cit> ; consequentially, the number of reports relying on the entire vdj region as clonal identifier is expanding  <cit> .

an emerging systems immunology method to quantitatively assess the antibody repertoire’s immense diversity is high-throughput immune repertoire analysis, which combines next-generation sequencing , bioinformatics, and statistical analysis of variable regions  <cit> . in particular, antibody repertoire ngs has become a powerful tool to quantitatively address fundamental questions in immunology related to lymphocyte development and differentiation  <cit> , discovery of clinical diagnostics based on antibody sequence biomarkers  <cit> , and antibody repertoire diversity  <cit> . one of the principal advantages of antibody ngs is the quantitative determination of clonal diversity and distribution, which provides valuable insight into clonal selection and expansion during humoral responses  <cit> . this assessment of clonal diversity and distribution offers new approaches for vaccine profiling and monoclonal antibody discovery and engineering  <cit> .

due to current technological limitations, the antibody repertoire diversity at any given time can at best only be estimated and not empirically determined in mammals  <cit> . therefore, the number of sequencing reads to accurately and reproducibly represent diversity information is unclear  <cit> . until recently, ngs using the  <dig> technology led to read counts in the range of 104– <dig>  <cit> , thus most likely undersampling b-cell and asc numbers  in both mice and humans  <cit> . the advent of the  <dig> bp paired-end read technology developed by illumina offers for the first time the possibility to assess antibody repertoire diversity by enabling  coverage of the entire vdj region and  the generation of large numbers of reads  at a more practical cost.

reproducible sequencing of antibody repertoires is of paramount importance for the development of diagnostic approaches  <cit> . in light of recent findings that antibody clonal abundance is correlated to antigen specificity  <cit> , reliable capture of ranking information is necessary for monoclonal antibody discovery and profiling of antibody responses to vaccines and infections. the concerns of undersampling the antibody repertoire naturally lead to the following questions  <cit> :  to what extent are antibody clones within one sample being detected by ngs?  what percentage of detected clones can be reliably and reproducibly identified?  to what extent do reliably detected clones bear accurate frequency information ?figure  <dig> 
motivation and experimental setup.  the problem of undersampling in ngs antibody repertoire sequencing is most easily explained by the marble analogy. assuming an urn is filled with k numbers of marbles of different species in varying frequencies–urn and marbles represent the original antibody mixture. the problem is clear: if only a sample of size n  is drawn, then three qualitatively different sampling outcomes can arise:  if n is too small, species richness  is not accurately determined and consequently neither are species frequencies.  in the case that n is larger, species richness is accurately represented but species frequencies can be off.  only if n is large enough, both species richness and frequency are accurately reflected in the sample. this study set out to answer, which outcome best describes antibody repertoire ngs data from ascs of immunized mice.  to address undersampling concerns, we explored two different scenarios of asc diversity:  <dig> female balb/c mice were immunized with np-cgg and sacrificed  <dig> days post-injection. subsequently, bone marrow plasma cells were isolated as described previously, as were cd138-positive splenocytes  <cit> . ascs of  <dig> mouse  were pooled as were those of  <dig> mice . rna was isolated, followed by rt-pcr and illumina miseq sequencing of triplicates .



for the statistical analysis of antibody ngs datasets, we leveraged long-established concepts of ecological population theory, which have only recently been applied to immunoglobulin repertoire diversity  <cit> . we found that regarding murine igg-positive asc repertoire sequencing approximately ≈ 3× <dig>  <dig> bp paired-end reads were sufficient to capture their essential diversity information–i.e. number of different clones and their respective clonal frequency–of cdr3s and full-length vdj regions alike. triplicate sequencing enabled us to efficiently call reliably detected clones as well as define a threshold for reliable clonal ranking.

this study establishes that ngs of antibody repertoires of immunized mice is a robust technique for exploring questions of fundamental immunological importance such as antibody diversity in response to antigen-challenge. finally, we offer experimental and computational guidelines for faithful antibody ngs that are independent of model organism, immunization scheme, and target cell population.

RESULTS
high quality illumina triplicate sequencing of antibody-secreting cells from pooled and individual mouse samples
two scenarios of immunological relevance were assessed for ngs reproducibility. first, we pooled spleen plasmablasts and plasma cells  and bone marrow plasma cells  of one mouse immunized with the model antigen np-cgg  and sacrificed  <dig> days post-immunization, hereafter called “1m”. the thus created cell pool contained approximately 3× <dig> viable ascs. second, in order to model extreme antibody diversity, we repeated the same cell isolation procedure from nine immunized mice  resulting in an asc pool of approximately  <dig> × <dig> viable cells .

from isolated cells, we recovered total rna and used rt-pcr to amplify expressed rearranged igg variable heavy genes. pcr was performed using a well-characterized and utilized primer set based on variable framework region  <dig> binding forward primers and one igg constant heavy region  <dig> reverse primer . similarly to previously published methods  <cit> , illumina adapters were added during the pcr step by using a direct addition approach, which adds adapters at the 5′ end of the gene-specific primer set, thus circumventing the need for ligation of adapters following pcr . for each of the two diversity scenarios , triplicates were prepared, where a triplicate signifies three separately indexed samples prepared from the same starting cdna pool; thus, variable region pcr amplification was independently performed in each of the triplicates . all six samples  were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform with  <dig> bp paired-end reads . sequencing yielded an average of  <dig> × <dig> raw reads  for each replicate with mean quality phred scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> .

sequences were processed  and submitted to the open-access immunogenetics /highv-quest platform  <cit>  in order to obtain full-length vdj region and cdr <dig> read annotation.

to account for sequencing errors that could artificially inflate diversity, all cdr <dig> and vdj singletons  were excluded prior to any data analysis, as were any reads with cdr3s shorter than  <dig> amino acids. the average number of thus filtered cdr3s and vdjs for 1m/9m were respectively ≈  <dig> ×106/≈ <dig> × <dig>  and ≈  <dig> /≈ <dig> × <dig> , which still represented approximately ≈ 95% and ≈ 61% of pre-filtered cdr <dig> and vdj sequences respectively .

antibody repertoire sequencing achieves deep coverage of cdr <dig> clonal diversity
throughout the entire study, we defined antibody clonality in two ways:  based on identical amino acid sequence of variable heavy chain cdr <dig> ;  based on identical amino acid sequence of full-length heavy chain vdj region. we focused on the analysis of the heavy chain because it contributes predominantly to antibody diversity and specificity  <cit> .

frequency distributions of cdr3s and vdjs differed markedly from one another. for each of the diversity scenarios , frequency distributions of vdjs were less polarized than cdr3s  since for any sample the number of unique vdjs was much higher than the number of unique cdr3s . due to an increased cdr <dig> and vdj diversity in 9m replicates, cumulative frequency curves saturated faster for 1m than for 9m; this was especially evident for cdr3s .

since comparison across replicates depends on their deep coverage, we first addressed the issue of undersampling. to do so, we relied on simulations that used a sequential sampling scheme  for both cdr <dig> and vdj clonal distributions. simulations were performed for one replicate dataset from the 1m and 9m triplicates. the replicate that was chosen was based on having the unfavorably highest ratio of different cdr3s to total cdr3s. we performed a bootstrapping approach with  <dig>  equally sized sampling steps, where in each step a random set of cdr3/vdj sequences  was added to virtual samples. sampling steps continued until virtual samples had accumulated the same number of sequences as the starting replicate .figure  <dig> 
diversity information was captured for all cdr <dig> and vdj clones with an abundance of two or more regardless of asc diversity . to address undersampling, we used a sequential sampling scheme  in which cdr <dig> and vdj datasets were divided into  <dig>  read subsets, which were successively added to virtual samples until they had the same size as the original samples. we performed  <dig> simulation runs for one sample of each diversity scenario  having the highest ratio of different cdr <dig> clones to total numbers of cdr3s. graphs show  the percentage of simulation runs with newly seen cdr3/vdj clones in a given subset;  the normalized median cdr3/vdj species richness;  normalized effective number of cdr3/vdj species, where “normalized” signifies the division by the respective maximal value.



on the basis of these simulations, we sought to plot species accumulation curves, which were determined by calculating the proportion of simulation runs that added new cdr3/vdj sequences to the virtual samples . an undersampling issue would be present in samples if new clones were still added at 100% of accumulated sequences  <cit> . however, we found that for both cdr <dig> and vdj and both diversity scenarios  the probability of obtaining a new clone nears zero for read accumulation rates ranging between 75% and 100% . we therefore concluded that repertoire ngs of murine antibody producing cells achieves high coverage of clonal diversity and is not substantially influenced by undersampling.

complementing species accumulation curves, we also plotted the median species richness of the simulation runs . species richness signifies the number of different cdr3/vdj sequences. species richness curves of both cdr3s and vdjs leveled off toward 75% of accumulated reads indicating that 75% of the sequences would have been enough to accurately represent a replicate’s species richness.

lastly, to study how frequency-dependent diversity depends on read accumulation, we assessed the change of the effective number of species as a function of accumulated reads. the effective number of species  is the exponential of the shannon entropy, which is a widely used measure of repertoire diversity  <cit> . if all clones are equally abundant, then the ens is high, tending towards the species richness. conversely, if one clone dominates the repertoire, then the ens is low, tending towards  <dig>  <cit> . in addition to including species richness, the ens also takes cdr3/vdj frequencies into account. for cdr3s, nearly the entire ens information was captured at only 25% of accumulated sequences, whereas for vdj it required nearly 75% of accumulated sequences for complete ens coverage . curves of 1m leveled off slightly faster than 9m curves.

to summarize, we found that independently of clonal definition, diversity scenario, and statistical method, diversity information was captured at or below 100% read accumulation. in particular, the number of reads needed to exhaustively cover antibody repertoire diversity was considerably reduced if cdr3/vdj frequency information was taken into consideration.

replicate sequencing enables reliable detection of antibody clones
leveraging the deep repertoire coverage, we proceeded by establishing a cutoff, which ensures that 99% of clones in a given replicate would be found in the two other replicates . resulting from this reliable detection cutoff, for 1m triplicates, the top  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cdr3s and for 9m triplicates, the top  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cdr3s were found to be reliably detected . accordingly, the numbers of reliably detected vdjs for 1m were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and for 9m  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the reliably detected cdr3/vdj clones for each replicate were used in all analyses shown hereafter. thus, replicate sequencing provided a powerful method to establish reliability of clonal detection.figure  <dig> 
establishing a cut-off for reliable clonal detection. for each replicate , starting with the highest frequency clones, clones were tested for their simultaneous presence in the respective two other replicates. for each clone, presence or absence in the other two replicates were recorded. we regarded all those clones as “reliably detected” that belonged to the highest frequency set of clones with a ratio of presence to absence ≥99%. the percentage of clones passing the detection threshold is indicated by vertical red bars. absolute numbers of reliably detected clones for cdr3-1m were , and for cdr3-9m were . for vdj, 1m and 9m absolute numbers were  and , respectively. for a graphical overview of the method of reliable detection, please refer to menzel et al.  <cit> .



high reproducibility of antibody repertoire sequencing
due to the high importance of reliable clonal ranking for antibody discovery and vaccination studies  <cit> , clonal cdr3/vdj frequencies were converted to ranks to check for reproducibility across triplicates. the highest rank was attributed to the cdr3/vdj identical amino acid sequence with the highest frequency, the second highest rank to the cdr3/vdj with the second highest frequency and so forth. rank-converted triplicates were pearson correlated in a pairwise fashion, which led to cdr <dig> correlation coefficients of r >  <dig>   and vdj correlation coefficients of r >  <dig>   for both diversity scenarios  . accordingly, correlations between triplicates based on cdr <dig> and vdj frequencies had very high coefficients . q-q plots also showed that in addition to ranking and frequency, clonal distributions were highly reproducible, thereby emphasizing the high fidelity of illumina miseq-generated antibody ngs data .figure  <dig> 
correlation of ranks of cdr <dig> and vdj sequences between replicates is high  demonstrating reproducibility of antibody repertoire sequencing. the ranks of cdr <dig>  and vdj  sequences were determined by assigning the highest rank to the cdr <dig> or vdj sequence with the highest abundance, the second highest rank to the cdr <dig> or vdj sequence with the second highest abundance and so forth. association of ranks was determined using pearson correlation . to circumvent overplotting, correlation plots are displayed using hexagons–purple indicates where data points accumulate. only reliably detected cdr <dig> and vdj sequences  were considered for the analysis shown.



deep coverage of antibody repertoires is crucial to obtain reliable ranking of antibody clones
in light of previous research demonstrating a correlation between clonal ranking and specificity  <cit> , we assessed the reliability of ranking as a function of sequence coverage. we defined reliability of ranking information as the coefficient of variation  of cdr3/vdj ranks across triplicates. hence, in contrast to pairwise correlation coefficients, reliability of ranking information took advantage of all three replicates for a given diversity scenario. we deemed the rank of a cdr3/vdj reliable if its cv was below  <dig> , which we used as a reliability cutoff . similarly to figure  <dig>  we used a sequential sampling scheme to assess the dependence of sequencing depth on rank reliability by calculating the ratio of the number of reliably ranked cdr3s/vdjs to the number of reliably detected cdr3s/vdjs as a function of accumulated reads. simulations showed that the maximum ratio of reliably ranked sequences was achieved at ≈ 25% of accumulated reads for both definitions of clonality  and both diversity spectra . ratios of reliably ranked clones are positively proportional to the number of different clones found per number of reads reaching a maximum of ≈ 50% for cdr3-1m and a minimum of ≈ 21% for vdj-9m . thus, with increasing cdr3/vdj diversity, the percentage of reproducibly detected clones that can be reliably ranked decreases.figure  <dig> 
reliable ranking of  cdr <dig> and  vdj sequences depends on deep sequence coverage of samples. plots show the ratio of reliably ranked clones–expressed as the median number of clones having a rank coefficient of variation  lower than  <dig> –to the number of reliably detected clones determined in figure  <dig> as a function of the proportion of accumulated reads. a loess curve was fitted to the calculated ratios  in order to extrapolate their overall distribution with a  <dig>  confidence interval . as species richness increases, the maximum value of the ratio decreases. across diversity scenarios  and clonal definitions  the respective maximum is reached at 25% of accumulated reads. simulations were performed analogously to those shown in figure  <dig> using a sequential sampling scheme . the cv was calculated based on ranks of cdr3/vdj clones across triplicates. absolute numbers of reliably ranked clones were: cdr3:  <dig> ,  <dig> ; vdj:  <dig> ,  <dig> .



in summary, triplicate sequencing does not only enable reliable calling but also ranking of antibody clones: notably, we show that both factors– replicate sequencing and  sequencing depth–are important for a high reliability of clonal detection and ranking.

discussion
ngs of antibody variable region repertoires has begun to make a major impact on the emerging field of systems immunology by providing a quantitative assessment of humoral immune responses. in this study, we assessed in great detail the robustness and reproducibility of ngs antibody amplicon data in a common experimental setting. to render our results relevant to a wide range of research groups, we used the common experimental setting of spleen and bone marrow asc from immunized mice. ascs are of great immunological interest  <cit>  as they represent the effector cell population of the humoral immune system producing the vast majority of circulating igg antibodies, which are responsible for immediate and long-term protection against pathogens  <cit> . experimentally, we adapted previously established methods for asc isolation and generation of antibody libraries for ngs  <cit> . as a result of recent improvements in read length of the illumina miseq platform, we were able to sequence full-length vdj regions. these improvements in sequencing technology were critical for the execution of this study and are increasingly being adopted for repertoire sequencing  <cit> . for data analysis, we used statistical approaches that have been first developed in ecological sciences  <cit>  but could be readily transferred to ngs, as questions regarding species discovery are fundamental problems encountered in both disciplines. these approaches have been recently applied to b- and t-cell repertoire analyses by other groups  <cit> .

specifically, our strategy consisted of using mouse asc populations after primary immunization from both normal diversity  and a high diversity  scenario to quantify clonal diversity and distributions of cdr <dig> and vdj amino acid sequences. we isolated ≈ 3× <dig> ascs in the 1m sample and ≈  <dig> × <dig> ascs in the 9m sample by magnetic bead-enrichment . since only ≈ 30–50% of these cells are estimated to be igg-positive  <cit> , the sequencing pool had an estimated size of 1× <dig> and 7× <dig> for 1m and 9m, respectively. the high diversity 9m scenario led to a less polarized distribution of cdr3s and vdjs compared to 1m . importantly, the overlap between 1m and 9m datasets was marginal suggesting minimal or no contamination across samples . biologically interpreted, the small overlap between 1m and 9m datasets  suggests that the antibody repertoires of the inbred mice immunized with a medium-complexity antigen  contained few shared clones. the small overlap of expressed antibody repertoires between individuals existing in a rather controlled environment has been previously shown by others  <cit> , including genetically identical immunized mice of the same cohort  <cit> . therefore, the 9m sample mirrored in fact a highly diverse antibody repertoire.

our analysis revealed the following major points:  with an average of ≈ 3× <dig>  <dig> bp reads per replicate, antibody repertoire ngs provided deep sequence coverage over a wide diversity range  with respect to multiple definitions of clonality ;  leveraging the deep repertoire coverage and the sequenced triplicates allowed for the establishment of unambiguous reliability cutoffs for clonal detection;  down-stream analysis with reliably detected clones demonstrated the reproducibility of both clonal detection and clonal frequency distributions;  the reliability of cdr3/vdj ranking  was not achieved to the same extent as clonal detection. furthermore, the percentage of reproducibly detectable cdr3s that can at the same time be reliably ranked decreased as clonal diversity increased  supporting the intuitive result that more diverse samples require greater sequencing depth for sufficient coverage.

we obtained reliable ranking information for approximately 21–50%  of the reliably detected cdr <dig> and vdj species richness . these accurately ranked sequences may be very valuable for monitoring the clonal selection and expansion that takes place following vaccination or primary infection. to further increase the resolution of clonal ranking, a dramatically increased number of reads would be necessary. assuming both a constant number of reliably detected clones and a linear relationship between the number of reliably ranked clones and sequencing depth, two  to five  times more reads would be necessary to reliably rank all reliably detected clones. indeed, toung and colleagues report that regarding rna-sequence analyses of human b-cells, a five times higher read coverage is necessary to accurately represent frequencies of reliably detected transcripts  <cit> . however, the above estimations should be regarded as lower bounds, as with increasing sequencing depth the number of reliably detected clones increases  and the relation between sequencing depth and ranking information is of non-linear nature. in fact, the impact of undersampling on ranking accuracy may in part explain why frequency-based discovery of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies was successful when applied to polarized bone marrow plasma cells from immunized mice  <cit>  but was unsuccessful when applied to the less polarized total splenocyte population from immunized rabbits  <cit> .

recently, vollmers and colleagues, performed ngs of human b-cell repertoires from vaccinated patients, in which they used rna template-barcoding to decrease errors introduced during pcr and illumina sequencing  <cit> . their approach dramatically reduced false positive species richness and especially eliminated to a large part singletons–which we found comprised 73–85% of unique sequences depending on the clonal definition–suggesting that our singletons are mostly due to sequencing error. in agreement with procedures adopted by other groups  <cit> , singletons were thus rightly eliminated from any data analysis conducted in this report without dramatically reducing the overall size of the datasets . in addition, we showed that removal of singletons does not substantially impact ens . however, it should be noted that in cases of very low coverage or read depth the removal of singletons may artificially decrease diversity. apart from technological limitations, the biological significance of very rare sequences is unclear and remains to be elucidated  <cit> .

while first and foremost our findings are valid for murine ascs collected from a specific mouse strain immunized once with a single antigen, implications regarding the dependence of the completeness of species richness and frequency information on asc diversity can be readily transferred to many other antibody repertoire sequencing studies. from the above conclusions, a generally valid framework in form of practical guidelines for the analysis and reliable information extraction from antibody ngs datasets emerges.  immunized mice can be sequenced with deep coverage yielding–in any diversity scenario–reliable detection and ranking of a minimum of at least 20% of reliably detected clones . this represents a higher number of candidate  clones than previously published  <cit> . importantly, the concept of reliable detection scales with the available sequencing depth; higher sequencing depth will result in higher numbers of reliably detected clones. indeed, figures  <dig> and  <dig> provide a direct assessment of the relation of sequencing depth and the extent to which reliable sequencing and ranking can be established. more generally, by providing ngs data for two definitions of antibody clonality in two different diversity scenarios, we provided benchmark and orientation values thus guiding ngs studies performed with other cell populations and/or other species, accordingly.  if one desires to perform robust antibody repertoire ngs, it is advantageous  to perform replicates per condition  in order to set thresholds of reliability for both cdr <dig> detection and ranking. it is reassuring that replicate sequencing is sufficient to achieve high reliability in antibody ngs in the presence of both pcr error and illumina sequencing error. indeed, it has been shown recently that the number of replicate samples significantly improves detection power–even more so than sequencing depth  <cit> .  statistical methods borrowed from theoretical ecology are especially useful if facing samples with unknown diversity, which is to this date still the case for all antibody ngs studies but especially pronounced in repertoire analyses of non-facs-sorted human pbmc b-cell populations  <cit> . importantly, diversity measures incorporating frequency information saturate faster for a given number of reads , allowing for meaningful diversity comparisons across samples even in the case of limited read numbers. nevertheless, we believe that the issue of biological undersampling in human samples still poses a challenge deserving further attention, as due to practical and ethical reasons it is typically only possible to obtain small fractions of human b-cells , which thus may not accurately represent the overall humoral immune status  <cit> .

recently, mrna/cdna barcoding using unique molecule identifiers   <cit>  has been used for error correction in immune repertoire ngs studies  <cit> . however, the extent to which the use of umis reproducibly decreases technological noise and increases the recovery of biological information is as of yet unknown  <cit> . studies involving umis are dependent on the deep coverage of umi diversity to ensure meaningful consensus-read formation  <cit> ; umi diversity is introduced via degenerate nucleotide regions within reverse transcription  primers, which itself may be a source of bias  <cit> . therefore, umi studies face potential pcr bias and undersampling problems both on the clonal and umi-tagging level. our above formulated framework does not assume any prior knowledge on sample preparation and is thus independent of experimental  and bioinformatical pre-processing steps. therefore, the framework’s guidelines may be readily applied to studies incorporating umi data correction and to further increase quantitation and reproducibility. applying statistico-ecological methods to umi-tagged datasets would allow crucial insight into the relation of sequencing depth and the extent of error correction. as of yet, subjective sequence cutoffs have been used to reduce the influence of technological noise on cross-sample comparisons  <cit> . in contrast, our concept of reliable detection and ranking relies on the explicit exploitation of replicate sequencing: it yields a list of reliably detected clones, which collectively define an unbiased range of detection reliability . therefore, our framework offers the possibility to be applied to all immunoglobulin  ngs studies, including those relying on umis as an additional step for error correction in order to determine upper and lower bounds of reliable detection and ranking. the definition of ranges of reliable detection and ranking may be valuable for drug and vaccine development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to robustly detect and rank antibody sequences is highly valuable for future investigations in systems immunology; specifically those in which accurate clonal diversity and distributions are critical such as in infection or vaccination studies  <cit> . now that antibody diversity information is being captured at a deep level, studies setting out to define antibody signatures of health and disease  <cit>  are justified as are studies taking advantage of diversity measures to compare antibody diversity across individuals  <cit> .
