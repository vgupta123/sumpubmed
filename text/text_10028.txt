BACKGROUND
bovine respiratory disease  is a worldwide animal health and welfare problem that costs the united states cattle industry over one billion dollars annually . multiple viral and bacterial pathogens, as well as host and environmental factors either cause or contribute to brd . m. haemolytica is a predominant bacterial agent of brd that causes severe fibrinonecrotic pneumonia in both beef and dairy cattle  <cit>  and historically has been the bacteria species most commonly isolated from the lungs of cattle afflicted with respiratory disease .


m. haemolytica is an opportunistic pathogen that often resides in the upper respiratory tract of cattle as a commensal, and invades the lower respiratory tract when animals are immunocompromised by viral infections, stress, or other factors . typing of m. haemolytica strains based on capsular phenotypes and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  have both indicated that m. haemolytica is comprised of distinct sub-species, or strain types, that do not all equally associate with brd  <cit> . strains with either a <dig> or a <dig> capsular serotypes have been more frequently isolated from the upper respiratory tracts of cattle without signs of respiratory disease, while strains with a <dig> or a <dig> serotypes have been more frequently isolated from the lungs and nasopharynx of diseased animals . similarly, a dendrogram of pfge profiles from m. haemolytica strains isolated from the nasopharynx of cattle with or without signs of respiratory disease was found to have two major clusters that disproportionately represented isolates from animals with and without signs of brd, respectively  <cit> .


m. haemolytica strains also demonstrate diverse susceptibility phenotypes to antimicrobials used to treat brd cases. overall, strains isolated from north american cattle with respiratory disease over the last several decades have trended towards decreasing susceptibilities to some of the antimicrobials used for treatment . conversely, m. haemolytica isolated from the upper respiratory tract of cattle without clinical signs of respiratory disease have tended to display lower overall antibiotic resistance than strains from diseased animals  <cit> .


m. haemolytica and other members of the pasteurellaceae family that cause brd can harbor plasmids or ices containing antibiotic resistance encoding genes . plasmids containing antibiotic-resistance genes have been recognized in m. haemolytica for over  <dig> years  <cit> . in contrast, ices have been recognized in brd-causing pathogens only recently. an ice was first identified in pasteurella multocida in  <dig>  that was isolated from a beef calf in nebraska and contained two regions encoding a total of  <dig> antibiotic resistance genes  <cit> . under laboratory conditions, icepmu <dig> was able to transfer from p. multocida to m. haemolytica by conjugation and integration  <cit> . homologs of icepmu <dig>  such as icemh <dig>  have subsequently been identified in field-collected isolates of m. haemolytica from cattle in nebraska, pennsylvania, and texas  <cit> . the homologs share a conserved backbone that consists of blocks of genes which are adjacent to antibiotic resistance gene regions  <cit> . the number and assortment of antibiotic resistance genes vary between homologs, and not all contain resistance genes. for example, icemh <dig> has five antibiotic resistance genes, while yet another putative homolog found in m. haemolytica strain usda_ars_usmarc  <dig> has none  <cit> . homologs to icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig> that contain antibiotic resistance genes do not appear restricted to one geographical region of north america  <cit> , and may have a wide distribution and role in m. haemolytica antibiotic resistance. given that capsular serotypes and pfge profiles both indicate that m. haemolytica strains do not all equally associate with brd, it is plausible that homologs containing antibiotic resistance genes could be more prevalent in m. haemolytica strains that associate with disease, as they would be more frequently exposed to brd prevention and control measures that include antimicrobials.

the aim of this study was to investigate m. haemolytica at the subspecies level for associations with diseased cattle lungs, the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig>  icemh <dig>  and other ice homologs, and antibiotic resistance genes found within variable regions of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig>  accordingly, there were three major goals. the first was to sequence the genomes of  <dig> mannheimia haemolytica isolates, including isolates from the lungs of diseased cattle that were located throughout much of north america, and isolates from the nasopharynx of cattle without clinical signs of respiratory disease. the second was to identify nucleotide polymorphisms that type m. haemolytica of north american cattle into well-supported clades using the sequences generated in this study, and those available from an additional  <dig> isolates. the third was to test nucleotide polymorphism-derived clades for associations with the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease, the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig>  icemh <dig>  and other related homologs, and antibiotic resistance genes harbored on icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig> 

RESULTS
isolate sequencing coverage and classification into groups
a total of  <dig> m. haemolytica isolates from north american cattle were sequenced to a minimum level of 10× sequence coverage per genome. another  <dig> isolates from north american cattle that were previously sequenced at the same level of coverage were also included in this study  <cit> . the isolates were arranged into two collections, zoetis and ksu-usmarc, that each consisted of two groups . the two groups of the zoetis collection  were each comprised of epidemiologically-unrelated isolates from the lungs of cattle with brd, however, isolates between the groups shared some epidemiological relatedness. within the ksu-usmarc collection, one group  consisted of non-clinical isolates from the nasopharynx of cattle without brd signs that were selected for minimal epidemiological relatedness. the other group  consisted of isolates from the lungs or nasopharynx of cattle with or without signs of respiratory disease. many isolates within the clinical and nonclinical group were epidemiologically related to each other.table  <dig> isolates used for whole genome sequencing and/or analyses

identification of nucleotide polymorphisms and m. haemolytica genotypes  <dig> and 2
prior to quality control filtering,  <dig>  putative polymorphisms were identified from the sequences of all  <dig> isolates included in the study. of those,  <dig>  polymorphisms were selected for further analyses that were not: 1) in duplicated genome or integrated phage regions of reference m. haemolytica strain usda-ars-usmarc- <dig>  2) singletons , or 3) ambiguously genotyped for more than 5% of the isolates. to generate a neighbor-joining tree that would be minimally influenced by missing data, the  <dig>  polymorphisms were additionally screened for those with allele genotype call rates of 95% or higher for the  <dig> isolates, which yielded  <dig>  polymorphisms . the tree of concatenated polymorphism genotypes depicted two deeply divided clades with strong bootstrap support . of the  <dig>  polymorphisms used to generate the tree,  <dig>  of them separated the two clades, where each allele was found exclusively in one of the clades. these two clades represent two major genotypes of m. haemolytica.

identification of subtypes and tagging nucleotide polymorphisms within genotype 1
the original set of  <dig>  polymorphisms was re-evaluated within  <dig> of  <dig> genotype  <dig> isolates classified in this study to identify polymorphisms suitable for higher resolution typing of genetic diversity within the genotype. four genotype  <dig> isolates were excluded from the analysis due to missing data. of the original  <dig>  polymorphisms,  <dig>  had a 90% or higher allele call rate for the  <dig> isolates . a total of  <dig> of the  <dig>  polymorphisms were informative for the identification of subtypes within genotype  <dig>  meaning that both polymorphism alleles were observed in genotype  <dig> isolates . a phi test for recombination applied to concatenated polymorphism alleles of the  <dig> isolates was positive . accordingly, a neighbor-joining network, which accounted for recombination  <cit> , was constructed from concatenated polymorphism alleles of each isolate . five clusters were observed that were all well-supported by shimodaira-hasegawa approximate likelihood ratio test  values that exceeded 80%, and with four of the clusters additionally supported by ultrafast bootstrap values exceeding 95%. of all  <dig> genotype  <dig> isolates classified in this study,  <dig>  placed unambiguously within one of the five clusters. only ten isolates were not confidently placed due to missing data and/or inadequate statistical support within a cluster . the five clusters represent  <dig> genetic divisions, or subtypes of genotype  <dig> m. haemolytica , .fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining network of concatenated nucleotide-polymorphism genotypes from  <dig> m. haemolytica genotype  <dig> isolates. letters and ellipsoids within the network represent subtypes and their boundaries, respectively. non-italicized numbers within the network represent maximum-likelihood support, and italicized numbers represent bootstrap support. the asterisk represents recombinant sequence of 2e on the backbone of 1b. the scale bar represents substitutions per site

the original set of  <dig>  polymorphisms was also re-evaluated within  <dig> of  <dig> genotype  <dig> isolates classified in this study to identify polymorphisms suitable for higher resolution typing of genetic diversity within genotype  <dig>  eight genotype  <dig> isolates were excluded from the analysis due to missing data. from the initial  <dig>  polymorphisms,  <dig>  had alleles observed at a frequency of 90% or higher for the  <dig> genotype  <dig> isolates. . a total of  <dig> of the polymorphisms were informative for genotype  <dig> . as in genotype  <dig>  the concatenated polymorphism alleles of genotype  <dig> isolates tested strongly positive for recombination . a neighbor-joining network constructed from the concatenated polymorphism allele genotypes of each of the  <dig> isolates yielded  <dig> clusters that were all well supported by both sh-alrt and ultrafast boot strap values . four clusters were assigned as subtype representatives . the one cluster not assigned to a subtype was primarily a 2b subtype that had recombined with either a 2c, 2d, or 2e subtype  in fig. 3), and was only represented by the concatenated nucleotide polymorphism genotypes of three isolates . recombination was also detected between subtypes 2b and 2d, as well as subtypes 2d and 2e .fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining network of concatenated nucleotide-polymorphism genotypes from  <dig> m. haemolytica genotype  <dig> isolates. letters and ellipsoids within the network represent subtypes and their boundaries, respectively. non-italicized numbers within the network represent maximum-likelihood support, and italicized numbers represent bootstrap support. the scale bar represents substitutions per site. asterisks indicate recombination: , , 




a total of  <dig> of all  <dig> genotype  <dig> isolates classified in this study  unambiguously placed in subtypes b, c, d, or e, or were identified as recombinants between the four subtypes. ten genotype  <dig> isolates were not assigned subtypes due to missing data and/or lack of statistical support within a cluster. tagging polymorphisms were identified for subtype 2b , 2c , and 2d , . none were found for subtype 2e, which could represent an ancestral state to the other subtypes.

association of genotype  <dig>  subtype b  m. haemolytica with antibiotic resistance genes encoded by icepmu <dig> or icemh1
nasopharyngeal non-clinical isolates were not included for association tests in this category as only six of them were genotype  <dig>  within  <dig> group  <dig> lung clinical isolates that were genotype  <dig> and subtyped with maximum likelihood significance,  <dig> were 2b and  <dig> were either 2c, 2d, or 2e. all  <dig> 2b isolates were positive for one or more of the antibiotic resistance genes encoded by icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig>  conversely,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genotype 2c, 2d, or 2e isolates were negative for all of the same antibiotic genes . within the  <dig> group  <dig> lung clinical isolates that were genotype  <dig> and subtyped with maximum likelihood significance,  <dig> were 2b and  <dig> were either 2c, 2d, or 2e. all  <dig> 2b isolates were positive for at least one of the antibiotic resistance genes encoded by icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig>  conversely, all  <dig> isolates that were either 2c, 2d, or 2e were negative for the genes. thus, 99% of the  <dig> tested isolates within the two lung clinical isolates groups that had antibiotic resistance genes encoded by icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig> were 2b, and the frequency of 2b isolates with one or more antibiotic resistance gene within both groups was 100%.fig.  <dig> association of m. haemolytica 2b with one or more antibiotic resistance gene found within the variable regions of icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig>  group  <dig> lung clinical isolates that were genotype  <dig>  were used for the association test. the single asterisk denotes genotype 2b that contains recombinant sequence. the network is a duplication of fig. 3





linkage of antibiotic resistance genes in 2b isolates
every 2b isolate in this study  had the gene tet , which encodes resistance to tetracycline  <cit> , as well as a copy of its repressor gene tet, . additionally, there was complete linkage of the genes apha <dig>  strb, stra and sul <dig> within all 2b isolates of the study. a total of  <dig> 2b isolates were positive for apha <dig>  strb, stra and sul <dig>  including  <dig> from groups  <dig> and  <dig> of lung clinical isolates. conversely,  <dig> 2b isolates were negative for apha <dig>  strb, stra and sul <dig> . collectively, these genes encode resistance to the aminogylcosides  and streptomycin ), and the sulphonamide sulfamethoxazole ,  <cit> . within the lung clinical isolate groups, linkage was also observed between the genes aadb, aada <dig>  flor, bla

all  <dig> antibiotic resistance genes encoded by icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig> occurred as one of seven different antibiotic resistance gene combinations identified within all 2b isolates of this study . the tet gene was present on all seven different combinations which accounted for 100% frequency of the gene in 2b isolates. while the genes apha <dig>  strb, stra and sul <dig> were perfectly linked to each other, they co-occurred in five different combinations, with combination one being the most frequent within groups  <dig> and  <dig> of lung clinical isolates. combination one consisted of apha <dig>  strb, stra, sul <dig>  and tet and was observed in lung clinical isolates which were obtained between  <dig> and  <dig> from diagnostic labs in three canadian provinces and  <dig> us states. combination one was additionally observed in 2b isolates of other groups that were obtained from cattle in tennessee, missouri, and kentucky in  <dig> . combination two, which had the second highest frequency in lung clinical isolate groups  <dig> and  <dig>  contained all  <dig> antibiotic resistance gene . this combination was found in  <dig> isolates that originated from diagnostic labs in  <dig> us states between the years  <dig> and  <dig>  the earliest observation of this combination was in a  <dig> isolate from a diagnostic lab in oklahoma . thus, combination two, which encodes resistance to aminoglycosides, sulphonamide, phenicols, tetracycline, β -lactams, and macrolides, has been in circulation in the u.s. for over a decade.fig.  <dig> unique combinations of antibiotic resistance genes and their frequencies in m. haemolytica 2b isolates from groups  <dig> and  <dig> of lung clinical isolates. section  shows the seven combinations identified in this study. plus signs indicate the gene is present, minus signs indicate the gene is not. sections  and  show the combination frequencies in 2b isolates of groups  <dig> and  <dig> of lung clinical isolates, respectively




discussion
a novel snp-based classification system for m. haemolytica of north american cattle was developed in this study. two major genotypes that both further divide into multiple subtypes were identified. the two genotypes significantly differ by their associations with the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease and ice sequence homologous to the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig>  additionally, just one subtype of genotype  <dig> associated with antibiotic resistance genes carried on icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig>  however, it is important to recognize how the isolates used to identify the associations differed from each other, that their history was not fully known regarding antibiotic exposure or lack thereof, and thus the context and some caveats regarding the associations identified in this study.

both anatomical location and animal disease status differed between isolates of the two groups used for association tests involving genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  which were group  <dig> of lung clinical isolates and the group of non-clinical nasopharyngeal isolates. group  <dig> of lung clinical isolates consisted of isolates from the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease, whereas the group of nasopharyngeal non-clinical isolates consisted of non-clinical isolates from the nasopharynx of cattle without signs of respiratory disease. consequently, the genotype  <dig> association is with the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease, as opposed, for example, to just respiratory disease exclusively, or the lungs exclusively. by extension, the ice sequence association with genotype  <dig> is also linked to the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease.

the two groups also differed by their depth of isolates across time and space. group  <dig> of lung clinical isolates consisted of  <dig> isolates that represented  <dig> u.s. states and  <dig> canadian provinces from the years 2002– <dig>  conversely, the group of nasopharyngeal non-clinical isolates represented three u.s. states and the year  <dig>  given that genotype  <dig> was the predominant genotype of the lung clinical isolates, whereas genotype  <dig> was the predominant genotype of the nasopharyngeal non-clinical isolates, genotype  <dig> was well represented in the study. however, it is quite possible that genotype  <dig> north american m. haemolytica have more subtypes than those presently characterized, due to limited geographical and temporal representation of genotype  <dig> diversity in this study.

additionally, for both groups used for association testing involving genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  the antibiotic treatment history of cattle from which the isolates originated was unknown. given that the  <dig> cattle from which the group  <dig> lung clinical isolates were obtained were afflicted with respiratory disease at the time they were sampled, it is likely that some may have received antibiotic treatments prior to sampling. it is also not known whether any of the  <dig> cattle from which the nasopharyngeal non-clinical isolates were obtained received antibiotics prior to their sampling at sale barn locations. disparate antibiotic exposure between isolates could have influenced ice or genotype frequency differences between the two groups.

although additional subtype diversity not observed in this study may exist within genotype  <dig> m. haemolytica of north america, it is unlikely that this diversity would associate with the lungs of diseased animals. this is because such diversity would have had notable frequency in either of the two groups of lung clinical isolates. the strength of the genotype  <dig> association with the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease was driven in large part by the classification of  <dig> of  <dig>  group  <dig> lung clinical isolates as genotype  <dig>  between the two groups of lung clinical isolates,  <dig> of  <dig>  of the isolates classified as genotype  <dig>  interestingly, of the  <dig> isolates that classified as genotype  <dig>  six could not be subtyped with any statistical significance . this may be because they gained alleles from genotype  <dig> that enhanced their pathogenicity through recombination, which may have complicated their placement within a particular subtype of genotype  <dig>  to that end, recombination was detected within and across the two genotypes. however, it is also possible that the  <dig> isolates, while present in the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease, were not the causative agents of that disease. it is not uncommon to find m. haemolytica together with other bacteria in the lungs of cattle afflicted with respiratory disease  <cit> .

although isolate exposure to antibiotics prior to entry in this study was unknown,  <dig> of  <dig>  of the genotype  <dig> isolates used for ice sequence association testing were negative for antibiotic resistance genes found in icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig>  rather, they contained sequence homologous to the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig> . thus, antibiotic selection does not appear to account for  <dig> of  <dig>  genotype  <dig> isolates having the conserved backbone ice sequence. however, given that genotype  <dig> isolates were observed in this study with the backbone ice sequence and aminoglycoside, sulfonamide, and tetracycline resistance genes, it is quite possible that the frequency of ices with antibiotic resistance genes could rise in genotype  <dig> m. haemolytica in the face of antibiotic exposure and selection.

while ices can have extensive host ranges, they are capable of preventing host cells from acquiring homologous ices by several different exclusion mechanisms  <cit> . given that virtually all genotype  <dig> isolates had sequence homologous to the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig>  and that virtually all antibiotic resistance genes that mapped to variable regions of icepmu <dig> or icemh <dig> placed on the 2b background, ices with the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig> that are devoid of antibiotic resistance genes may be providing resistance to the acquisition of other ice homologs with antibiotic resistance genes in 2e and 2d m. haemolytica. the same may also be true for 2c m. haemolytica. there were  <dig> isolates in this study that were 2c, and none of them had detectable antibiotic resistance genes. however, only two of those isolates belonged to lung clinical isolate groups and were epidemiologically unrelated, whereas the other  <dig> isolates were epidemiologically close to each other.

in stark contrast to all other m. haemolytica subtypes, every m. haemolytica 2b isolate in this study was positive for one or more antibiotic resistance gene in addition to the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig>  this may be because the ancestor of extant 2b m. haemolytica either did not originally have an ice homologous to the conserved backbone of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig> that lacked antibiotic resistance genes, or replaced it with a homolog that did. it is interesting that teth, which encodes an efflux protein that provides tetracycline resistance  <cit> , was identified on all seven combinations of resistance genes . this infers it may be ancestral in its acquisition order compared to the other resistance genes. oxytetracycline was licensed for use in the u.s. in product form in  <dig>  <cit> . additionally, prior to  <dig>  tetracycline compounds were used as growth promotants in cattle feed  <cit> . therefore, selective pressure for tetracycline resistance may have been the result of cattle exposure to tetracyclines in the u.s. at therapeutic or sub therapeutic levels for decades.

given that 2b m. haemolytica have seven antibiotic resistance gene combinations with the conserved ice backbone, including one that encodes resistance to one or more antibiotic within six different classes , and has been circulating in the u.s. since at least  <dig>  there has been considerable selection for this particular subtype to acquire antibiotic resistance. while all the subtypes of genotype  <dig> associate with the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease, it not known if one particular subtype is more virulent then another. if the ancestor of 2b m. haemolytica did have an ice homolog to icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig> that lacked antibiotic resistance genes, enhanced virulence in comparison to other genotype  <dig> subtypes may have resulted in an increased exposure to antibiotic treatments, and selection pressures that overcame any preventative effects of the ancestral ice against the acquisition of homologous ices with antibiotic resistance genes.

the clades that define genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are separated by  <dig>  tagging polymorphisms that are distributed throughout the m. haemolytica genome. the alleles of these polymorphisms are completely linked to each other in the genomes of the  <dig> isolates included in this study, and define core genome backbones of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> m. haemolytica . while these tagging polymorphisms make it quite tractable to distinguish between the two genotypes, as any one of them could be used to classify an m. haemolytica as belonging to either genotype  <dig> or  <dig> , they also complicate the identification of alleles that are biologically causative for the association of genotype  <dig> m. haemolytica with the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease. this is because alleles that biologically cause genotype  <dig> m. haemolytica to have that association are in linkage with thousands of other polymorphism alleles that tag the same genotype backbone.

of the five subtypes defined in genotype  <dig>  three of them  showed signs of recombination through blocks of physically close tagging polymorphism alleles. conversely, 1c and 1f had relatively few tagging polymorphisms that did not fall into blocks . the lack of recombination in 1c and 1f indicates that they may be ancestral to 1b, 1e, and 1i, and that diversification in genotype  <dig> was driven by recombination on either the 1c or 1f background. similarly, of the four subtypes defined in genotype  <dig>  two of them had blocks of tagging polymorphisms that were indicative of recombination , whereas two did not , . thus, 2c and 2e appear ancestral to 2b and 2d, with recombination having driven diversification on either of their backgrounds to yield 2b and 2d. consequently, m. haemolytica diversity in north america appears to be defined by a split of two major lineages with linear descent that was later followed by recombination and further diversification within both lineages, giving rise to the two major genotypes and their subtypes.

CONCLUSIONS
north american m. haemolytica of cattle place into two major genotypes that are each defined by multiple subtypes. genotype  <dig> m. haemolytica associate with the lungs of cattle with respiratory disease, and also with the conserved sequence backbone of icepmu <dig>  icemh <dig>  and other ice homologs that does not contain antibiotic resistance genes. genotype  <dig>  subtype b m. haemolytica associate with antibiotic resistance genes that map to variable regions of icepmu <dig> and icemh <dig>  this particular subtype has been circulating in the u.s. since at least  <dig> and may be more virulent to cattle than other genotype  <dig> subtypes. tagging polymorphisms were identified that distinguish the two genotypes and their subtypes. rapid identification of virulent antibiotic resistant strains of m. haemolytica in the field could facilitate interventions that prevent or minimize brd outbreaks and ineffective antibiotic treatments, and consequently reduce therapeutic needs for treating brd. additionally, effective vaccines developed against genotype  <dig> m. haemolytica could further reduce the prevalence of brd and subsequent needs for antibiotic treatments.
