BACKGROUND
prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  are unique, fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect a variety of species including sheep and goats , cattle , human , mink , deer, elk and moose . a characteristic feature of tses is the accumulation of an alternative conformational isoform  of the host-encoded normal prion protein  in the central nervous system  <cit> . in classical ovine scrapie, deposition of prpsc in the lymphoreticular system precedes accumulation in the central nervous system  <cit> . prpsc is readily detected in this preclinical stage by biopsy of the lymphoid tissue in the nictitating membrane  <cit>  or in the rectoanal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue .

the early and persistent presence of prpsc in the lymph nodes in classical ovine scrapie, human variant cjd , cwd and most rodent scrapie models suggests that prions are disseminated in the peripheral blood and/or lymphatics and that peripheral blood might be a suitable target for preclinical diagnostic testing. prion infectivity in ovine blood was confirmed by transfusions of whole blood, buffy coat, red cell concentrates, plasma or platelets from donor sheep with experimental bse or classical scrapie  <cit> . prpsc was detected in pbmcs of  <dig> of  <dig> clinical scrapie infected sheep using protein misfolding cyclic amplification   <cit>  but in only  <dig> of  <dig> clinical scrapie infected sheep when using a conventional enzyme linked immunosorbent assay   <cit> . a recent elisa-based study concluded that prpsc was principally associated with a subpopulation of b lymphocytes in scrapie infected sheep  <cit> . although prpsc was detected in b lymphocytes in  <dig> of  <dig> clinical scrapie infected sheep, b lymphocytes from only three of five scrapie infected sheep at the preclinical stage were positive for prpsc by elisa. prpsc has also been detected in plasma samples collected from both preclinical and clinical scrapie infected sheep but only after combining a novel surround optical fiber immunoassay  with limited prpsc amplification by pmca  <cit> .

although prpsc has been detected in the blood of scrapie-infected sheep by enriching conventional elisa-based assay with cellular fractions including pbmcs or b lymphocytes, the frequency of such detection was lower during the preclinical stage of the disease. thus, the objectives of this study were to identify blood fractions of sheep which harbor relatively high levels of prion infectivity, including during the preclinical stage of disease. the present study used a short-observation transfusion model in the natural host to determine if relatively high infectivity was present in the total pbmc population, a cd72+ pan b lymphocyte population, a cd21+ subpopulation of b lymphocytes and either platelet-rich or platelet-poor plasma isolated from the blood of classical scrapie-infected sheep. in addition, it was also determined if high infectivity could be demonstrated in both platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma during clinical disease. such demonstrations should help guide further efforts toward improvement of elisa-based scrapie detection sensitivity by pre-assay enrichment with relevant blood fractions.

scrapie infectivity associates with blood components
 whole blood transfused recipients develop preclinical scrapie
whole blood was collected from three preclinical and three clinical scrapie infected donor sheep and different blood volumes were transfused to  <dig> recipients as shown in table  <dig>  three of four prnp marq/mvrq recipients and all four marq/marq recipients became antemortem ramalt positive for prpsc between  <dig> to  <dig> days post transfusion  and  <dig> to  <dig> dpt, respectively . none of these eight animals showed any signs of scrapie when they were euthanized at  <dig> to  <dig> dpt. ihc analysis of postmortem rectal and retropharyngeal lymph nodes of all eight animals showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles . prpsc was undetectable in antemortem and postmortem rectal tissues and other lymphoid tissues of two marq/tarq recipients . prpsc labeling was also not detected in antemortem rectal biopsies of all three tarq/mvrq animals; however when necropsied rectal tissues of two animals and retropharyngeal lymph nodes of all three animals showed positive labeling for prpsc . clinical signs were not observed in any of these three recipients and prpsc was undetectable in brain tissues of all the animals.

 buffy coat transfused recipients develop preclinical scrapie
buffy coat fraction was prepared from one clinical scrapie infected donor sheep and transfused to five recipients . all three marq/marq buffy coat recipients became antemortem ramalt biopsy positive for prpsc between  <dig> to  <dig> dpt . postmortem rectal tissues and retropharyngeal lymph nodes along with other lymphoid tissues of these three animals showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles  although prpsc was not detected in the brain tissues. two of these three animals did not show clinical signs of scrapie when they were euthanized at  <dig> and  <dig> dpt. clinical signs of scrapie developed in the remaining animal, which was euthanized at  <dig> dpt. brain tissue of this animal  was positive for prpsc by both ihc and wb assays. one of two remaining buffy coat recipients with the marq/tarq prnp genotype became rectal biopsy positive for prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles at  <dig> dpt while prpsc labeling was not detected from the remaining other animal at  <dig> dpt. there were no clinical signs of scrapie in either of these two animals when euthanized at  <dig> dpt . postmortem rectal tissues and retropharyngeal lymph nodes along with other lymphoid tissues of the ramalt positive animal  showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles and the brain tissues by ihc . lymphoid follicles of retropharyngeal lymph nodes and ileocecal junction of the other animals  showed positive prpsc labeling .

 peripheral blood mononuclear cell transfused recipients develop preclinical scrapie
pbmcs were prepared from five preclinical scrapie infected donor sheep and transfused to  <dig> recipients . antemortem rectal biopsies from four of five mvrq/mvrq recipients  became positive for prpsc labeling between  <dig> and  <dig> dpt . there were no clinical signs of scrapie in any of these animals. all five were euthanized between  <dig> and  <dig> dpt. rectal tissues, retropharyngeal lymph nodes and most other lymphoid tissues of all five animals showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles . prpsc labeling in brain tissues was only detected in one animal . antemortem rectal biopsies of six of nine marq/mvrq animals showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles between  <dig> and  <dig> dpt. rectal tissues collected at necropsy from two of three previously ramalt prpsc undetectable animals remained undetectable for prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles . only the retropharyngeal lymph node of one recipient  showed positive prpsc labeling while most of the other lymphoid tissues collected at necropsy from all the other eight animals showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles. brain tissues of two animals necropsied at  <dig> dpt showed positive prpsc labeling while prpsc labeling was not detected in all the other animals. antemortem rectal tissue of the remaining tarq/mvrq recipient was positive for prpsc at  <dig> dpt. rectal tissues, retropharyngeal lymph nodes and several other lymphoid tissues collected at necropsy from this animal showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles . however, prpsc was not undetected in the brain tissues.

 b lymphocyte recipients develop preclinical scrapie
since pbmcs from four donor animals were able to cause scrapie in recipient sheep, another preclinical scrapie infected sheep was selected as a blood donor to identify prion infectivity in b lymphocytes. as a control for the study, three recipients were transfused with cd18-labeled pbmcs and all the recipients in this group showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles . since mvrq/mvrq animals became prpsc positive more quickly than other genotypes, six lambs with this genotype were selected for the b lymphocyte transfusion experiment. cd72+ b lymphocytes and cd21+ b lymphocytes were separated from pbmcs using a magnetic labeling procedure with 95% purity as assessed by flow cytometry . ihc examination of antemortem rectal biopsies collected from all three cd72+  and two of three cd21+  b lymphocyte recipients showed positive prpsc labeling between  <dig> and  <dig> dpt . rectal as well as all the other lymphoid tissues collected from both types of b lymphocyte recipients at necropsy showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles . however, prpsc was not detected from any of the brain tissues of all six animals.

 platelet-rich plasma recipients develop preclinical scrapie
platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma was prepared from two clinical scrapie infected donor sheep and transfused to six recipients. three marq/marq lambs were transfused with platelet-rich plasma prepared from two clinical scrapie donors . antemortem rectal biopsies of two of three recipients showed positive prpsc labeling between  <dig> and  <dig> dpt . the three animals did not show any clinical signs of scrapie when they were euthanized at  <dig> or  <dig> dpt. prpsc was detected in retropharyngeal lymph nodes and all the other lymphoid tissues examined in the two rectal biopsy positive animals, but prpsc was not detected in the same tissues in the previously biopsy negative animal . in addition, prpsc remained undetectable in brain tissues from these animals. prpsc was not detected in the tissues from the three recipients of platelet-poor plasma when euthanized at  <dig> dpt .

discussion
removal of exogenous and endogenous prion infectivity from red blood cell preparations of scrapie-infected hamster blood by leukoreduction filters resulted in significant reduction of scrapie infection in hamsters following transfusion  <cit> . leukodepletion significantly reduced the risk of vcjd transmission in human following blood transfusion recipients as well  <cit> . however, a recent study by mccutcheon et al.,  revealed that leucoreduction did not prevent the bse transmission to sheep following a single blood transfusion  <cit> . detection of prpsc labeling in the lymphoid tissues and development of clinical scrapie in whole blood and buffy coat transfusion recipients in this study as well as in previous studies  <cit>  confirmed that prion infectivity is associated with blood from classical scrapie infected sheep. although previous sheep blood transfusion studies used a relatively large volume of whole blood , volumes of  <dig> -  <dig> ml whole blood from scrapie infected sheep were sufficient to transmit scrapie infection to the most recipients in this study. it is difficult to avoid the loss of pbmcs during density-gradient cell separation and macs-based cell enrichment procedures  due to the multiple washing steps involved and the inherent limitation to the cell-binding capacity of the columns. therefore, it is possible that even much lower volumes of scrapie infected sheep blood might be sufficient to cause infection in sheep. demonstration of prion infectivity in much smaller volumes of blood may be helpful in development of conventional blood-based diagnostic testing for scrapie in sheep.

we used standard ihc detection of prpsc in tissues as a surrogate marker for transmission of infectivity to preclinical recipient sheep. analysis of antemortem and postmortem lymphoid tissues in sheep receiving transfusion with the pbmc fractions were confirmed positive for prpsc immunolabeling indicating that prion infectivity is associated with pbmc fraction of sheep blood. previous studies showed prpsc was detected from pbmcs  <cit>  and a subpopulation of b lymphocytes  <cit> . cd <dig> has been identified as a pan b lymphocyte marker in sheep  <cit>  and also in mice  <cit> . approximately 50% of adult sheep b lymphocytes are positive for cd <dig>  <cit> . a significant proportion of peripheral lymphocytes recirculate continuously between the blood, the lymph and the tissues. the lymph nodes are the major site of exchange for recirculating lymphocytes between the blood and the lymph. the migration competent or recirculating b lymphocytes readily migrate into the lymphatic recirculation pathway due to the cell surface expression of cd <dig> and cd62l or l-selectin  <cit> . therefore, we used anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> mabs to isolate pan b lymphocytes and recirculating b lymphocytes from the pbmcs fraction, respectively. transfusion of cd72+ b lymphocytes or cd21+ b lymphocytes from scrapie infected sheep resulted in prpsc detection in lymphoid tissues of recipients. these results are consistent with prpsc being detected in mhc class ii dq+, sigm+, cd11b+, cd11c+ and cd21+/- b lymphocytes in sheep  <cit> , and cd72+ b lymphocytes harboring infectious cwd prions in white-tailed deer  <cit> .

the present study utilized a short observation period in the natural host as a model biased for quick detection of blood fractions having relatively high prion levels. the platelet-poor plasma fraction from scrapie infected sheep did not contain adequate levels of prion infectivity for detection in this model. two of the three marq/marq lambs transfused with platelet rich plasma were positive by rectal biopsy  <dig> and  <dig> post-transfusion, approximately the same interval seen in marq/marq lambs transfused with whole blood  or buffy coat cells . cwd and bse infectivity were associated with platelets or platelet-rich plasma pellets in white-tailed deer  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> , respectively. however, hamsters inoculated with platelets from scrapie infected hamsters did not develop scrapie  <cit> . the possibility exists that rodent models and ruminants have slightly different cells that contain infectivity or the processing of platelets could affect scrapie infectivity. other studies have suggested that there is cell-free prpsc in sheep plasma  <cit> . passage of radioactively labeled, highly purified murine prpsc through the mouse blood-brain barrier  <cit>  and detection of prpsc in sheep circumventricular organs that lack a blood-brain barrier  <cit>  suggest the possibility of cell-free prpsc in the blood. detection of prpsc by pmca in hamster plasma samples devoid of platelets suggests the possibility of cell-free prpsc in hamster plasma  <cit> . similarly, vcjd infectivity in plasma components has been reported from human donors suggesting cell-free plasma can also carry infectious vcjd prions  <cit> . given the similarity in pathogenesis between bse and scrapie infection in sheep, one would expect similar outcome from both forms. however, a recent study by mccutcheon et al.,  with bse-infected sheep revealed that platelet-poor plasma supernatant can also efficiently transmit prion infectivity to recipient lambs following a single blood transfusion  <cit> . the detection of preclinical scrapie in recipient lambs took  <dig> to  <dig> dpt. the lack of prpsc detection in lymphoid tissues of platelet-poor plasma recipients in our study could have been due to a lower prion titer in platelet-poor plasma samples and/or necropsy of animals at  <dig> dpt. poisson distribution of particles in solution indicates a far greater number of recipient animals per group would have been necessary to distinguish sample fraction "titers". in contrast to sheep, hamster and human findings, recent studies in white-tailed deer and cervidized transgenic mouse revealed that cwd infectivity was not associated with platelet-poor plasma, but with platelets  <cit> . although the presence of prpsc in hamsters' plasma fraction is confirmed, prion infectivity in that fraction has not yet been reported.

our previous study demonstrated that one nonsynonymous allele  was associated with prolonged survival in marq/tarq scrapie-exposed sheep compared to marq/marq sheep  <cit> . although the focus of this study was to identify which blood components carry prion infectivity, four marq/tarq and four tarq/mvrq animals were included to assess whether t <dig> polymorphism might delay prpsc detection in ramalt follicles following infection by transfusion. lack of prpsc labeling in ramalt follicles of six of eight recipients confirms that t <dig> polymorphism delayed prion accumulation in sheep rectal lymphoid tissues. although the number of animals used in this study was limited, the delay in prpsc accumulation in ramalt particularly in marq/tarq animals needs to be considered when scrapie diagnosis is determined.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that prion infectivity is associated with b lymphocytes and platelet-rich plasma of sheep with classical scrapie. enrichment of platelets as well as b lymphocytes should enhance assay detection sensitivity for scrapie.
