BACKGROUND
worldwide, there are over  <dig> million people persistently infected with hepatitis b virus   <cit> . chronic hbv infections may have serious consequences, including acute hepatitis, as well as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma   <cit> . together, these are responsible for over  <dig> million deaths worldwide each year  <cit> . current treatments for hbv infections are not only expensive and have significant side effects, but also only induce a partial response  <cit> .

in eukaryotic cells, rna interference , a type of double-stranded  rna, initiates and directs sequence-specific, post-transcriptional silencing of homologous genes  <cit> . it has been demonstrated in previous studies that expression and replication of hbv can be suppressed by sirna or shrna with clinical implications  <cit> . however, the wide heterogeneity of hbv sequences may render rnai inhibitors ineffective. to explore this further,  <dig> shrna expression plasmids were constructed to target the sites that were conserved among hbv genotypes a through i. their anti-hbv efficacy was then evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
screening for effective and broad anti-hbv shrna
the shrna plasmids co-transfected with two hbv  <dig>  plasmids  exhibited varying levels of extracellular hbsag expression . of the forty shrna plasmids, four plasmids  were selected as candidates for further research based on their remarkable inhibitory ability and also relatively lower off-target probability . the sequence conservation among the a to i genotypes for b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % , respectively . the data also shows that the target sequences of b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> were more conserved than the target sequence of b <dig>  in genotype b and c .

adverse side-effects evaluation for selected shrna plasmids
the b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> plasmids were transfected into huh <dig> cells to determine cytotoxicity by the wst- <dig> assay. no significant sirna-induced cytotoxicity was observed for these sirna when compared to an empty psuper vector . the mrna levels of four major interferon stimulated genes  in transfected cells were measured by quantitative realtime pcr with gapdh mrna acting as a control. as shown in figure  <dig>  between values  <dig> and  <dig>  logarithmic increases for the ifn-stimulatable mrnas were only observed in the ifn-treated cells, but not observed in any of the shrna treated cells vs. untreated cells. from this, it can be concluded that an ifn response is not activated by these anti-hbv sirnas.

shrna inhibit gene expression of hbv strains with different genotypes in vitro
the levels of cytoplasmic hbv pg/pc rna  and hbv dna in cultured supernatants were determined by realtime rt-pcr/pcr and presented in figure  <dig>  the pg/pc rna level of five hbv strains with different genotypes were reduced by 58%~93% in b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> treatments, while the hbv dna level observed in supernatants was decreased by 77%~99% in these shrna plasmid treatments .

in addition, the extracellular and intracellular antigen levels in huh <dig> cells that were co-transfected with hbv and shrna plasmids were also determined . in the shrna-treated huh <dig> cells, the average extracellular hbsag expression level of all five hbv strains decreased by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  logs. the average intracellular hbsag expression level decreased by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  logs, while the extracellular hbeag levels decreased by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  logs, and the intracellular hbcag levels by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  logs. the effect of the sirna treatment on hbeag levels was weaker than that on the hbsag or hbcag levels .

inhibition of gene expression of hbv strains with different genotypes in vivo
using the mouse model of acute hepatitis b virus infection  <cit> , the profiles of serum hbsag and hbeag were used to evaluate the effect of shrna over nine days . all hbv plasmids expressed detectable hbsag and hbeag in mice sera . as compared to the control mice , b <dig> and b <dig> treatments reduced hbsag expression by over 99% in all five hbv genotypes. furthermore, b <dig> and b <dig> treatments suppressed hbsag by over 99% in mice infected with hbv genotypes a, b, c and d. in a novel w <dig> strain representing genotype i however, b <dig> and b <dig> treatments only reduced hbsag expression by about 90%. with regards to serum hbeag for genotypes a, b, c, d and i, b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> treatments suppressed hbeag by 96%~99%, 79%~99%, 94%~99%, and 89%~99%, respectively. the overview of the results shows that b <dig> is the most potent agent.

discussion
activated rnai pathway can silence hbv replication and expression  <cit> . however, in most previous studies, the activity of rnai against hbv is often evaluated with only one hbv strain  <cit> . nine hbv genotypes , designated as the letters a through i, have been recognized with an accompanying sequence divergence of >8% over the entire genome  <cit> . the influence of genotypes on hbv replication efficacy and antigen expression level had been proved to be various and that may further associate with clinical outcomes and antiviral treatments responses  <cit> . hence, rnai designed for one genotype may not necessarily be effective against another genotype. given the high heterogeneity of hbv strains and the sensitivity of sirna to the sequence changes, designing sirna targets against the conservative site on hbv genome is essential to ensure activity across all genotypes  <cit> .

in shrna expression systems, two different promoters are predominantly used: u <dig> and h <dig>  both driven by human polymerase iii . compared to pol ii promoters, pol iii promoters generally possess a greater capacity to synthesize rna transcripts of a higher yield and rarely induce interferon responses  <cit> . however, a previous study noted that u <dig> pol iii-expressed shrnas may cause serious toxicity in vivo by saturating the endogenous mir pathway  <cit> . in this report, we constructed  <dig> shrna plasmids  with various targets, using a human h <dig> pol iii promoter. the target sequences of the final four selected shrna plasmids demonstrated high sequence conservation among a to i genotypes and significant inhibition activity, in both huh <dig> cells and mice, against the expressions of hbv rna, dna and antigens in genotypes a, b, c, d and i. the inhibitory efficacy of these shrnas  however, varies significantly against the various genotypes for different viral markers in different models . such differences in efficiency may be due to differences in the mrna's secondary structure or the target site accessibility  <cit> . b <dig> was the most effective of the four candidates.

it should be noted that both the cell-transfection model and hydrodynamic injection model more closely resemble an acute model of a hbv infection. this is a potential limitation in this study, as most individuals who need anti-hbv therapy are chronically infected. compared to the hbv transgenic mouse models and stably transfected cell lines, the former are more flexible and convenient in evaluating the efficacy of shrnas as a way to inhibit various hbv strains. nevertheless, the effective shrna candidates should be studied further in different models.

because hbv contains overlapping open reading frames  and all four hbv transcripts overlap in their 3' terminals, a single sirna targeting multiple areas could be designed to maximize inhibitory potency  <cit> . the sirnas targeting c orf, such as b2389~b <dig>  presented in table  <dig>  show activity only against the  <dig>  kb pregenomic rna, but are unlikely to show any activity against the other three transcripts . meanwhile, all four sirnas demonstrated more silencing activity with regards to hbsag expression than hbeag expression for various genotypes in the cell cultures and mice. the targets on both however were the same in the hbv transcripts for the two proteins , which was also observed in a previous study  <cit> . hbcag, a viral capsid correlated with viral replication  <cit> , was silenced as effectively as hbsag, but hbeag was not .

the registered agents currently available for the treatment of hbv infections, such as interferon and nucleoside analogues, can dramatically decrease hbv dna levels and induce particular hbeag loss, but will rarely cause hbsag loss in chronic hepatitis b patients  <cit> . rna interference, on the other hand, can theoretically be directed to cleave any target rna, providing a novel methodology for anti-hbv therapy  <cit> . in the present study, and supported by other studies  <cit> , using rnai as an inhibitor for hbv effectively reduces viral antigen levels, including hbsag. it can be speculated that rnai-treatments may offer complementary effects for current anti-hbv therapy. however, the final application of rnai-based anti-hbv drugs depends on the development of effective and safe rnai delivery systems.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, four candidate shrna plasmids significantly inhibited hbv genotypes a, b, c, d and i in vitro and in vivo. a potential avenue of investigation would be a combination strategy of various sirna in a single transcript to improve efficacy and also prevent or at least delay the rise of viral escape mutants.
