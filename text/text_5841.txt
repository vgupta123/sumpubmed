BACKGROUND
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  includes epithelial cancers of the lip, oral cavity, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, salivary glands, larynx and pharynx   <cit>  and represents the sixth most common cancer in the world  <cit>  with an average 5-year survival rate of approximately 65 %  <cit> . some of the tumors are unresectable because of their complex anatomy  <cit> . in addition, hnscc is usually not detected in the early stages of the disease due to the lack of clinical symptoms, which aggravates treatment  <cit> . the challenges in treating hnscc tumors are functional preservation of substantial organs, such as salivary glands, and minimization of side effects, such as dysphagia. moreover, hnscc tumors show a high degree of heterogeneity and variation in the therapeutic response requiring individualized treatment strategies  <cit> . in order to address these issues, combined and targeted treatment strategies as well as more effective treatment monitoring is needed to improve therapy outcomes and patients’ quality of life.

micrornas  represent a class of non-coding rnas acting as posttranscriptional gene expression regulators by inhibiting translation or destabilizing mrnas. they are known to be involved in regulating and coordinating multiple cellular pathways and processes. mirnas show a response to various cellular stressors and are key players in many diseases such as cancer  <cit> . specific mirna signatures were discovered for several tumor types  <cit> . for hnscc a considerable number of mirnas were identified as promising molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis targeting either oncogenic or tumor suppressor transcripts . however, there is still uncertainty concerning the functional role of most of the mirnas since one mirna may target multiple mrnas while one mrna can be regulated by a number of different mirnas.

network-based integrative analysis combining molecular data from multiple levels represents a valuable tool for a better understanding of complex signaling networks and related biological processes. correlation analysis of expression values of potentially interacting molecules enables reconstruction of interaction networks based on experimental data. in this study integrative analysis of mirna and mrna profiles based on the identification of correlating expression patterns revealed potential functional relationships and pathways involved in the cellular treatment response  <cit> . the analysis can be strengthened by integration of data bases on previously validated target interactions. another tool for the in silico investigation of interactions is pathway enrichment analysis, which annotates molecules of interest, e.g. differentially expressed genes, to cellular pathways based on over-representation using the information of pathway databases, such as reactome  <cit> .

the aim of the current study was to shed light on the cellular functions of therapy-responsive mirnas and to gain additional information on the treatment effects on cellular processes and pathways in order to enable the identification of potential therapeutic targets. for this purpose we used primary hnscc cells as a cell culture model for radiochemotherapy  <cit>  and performed integrative analysis of the mirna and mrna expression profiles in order to analyze affected pathways for a better understanding of the response of hnscc cells to radiochemotherapy.

we aimed to validate our in vitro data by focusing on a therapy-responsive network of patient-derived data from a previous study  <cit> .

RESULTS
characterization of the primary hnscc cell lines
the newly established hnscc cell lines hn <dig>  and hn <dig>  were published in a previous study, where a cell culture model was established to simulate radiochemotherapy of a hnscc patient cohort in vitro  <cit> . for the cell culture model primary cell cultures were selected instead of established cell lines since the features of primary cells are closer to the conditions in the patient. a further selection criterion for the primary cell lines was that they were derived from tumor sites, that were also represented in the hnscc patient cohort  <cit> . apart from that, we selected one p53-mutated  and one p <dig> wild type  primary cell line. a nasopharyngeal carcinoma was included since standard treatment for these tumors is radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy due to their high sensitivity towards this treatment  <cit> . characteristics of the primary cells lines are listed in table  <dig>  in the present study we used the radiochemotherapy cell culture model in order to gain information on the molecular radiochemotherapy response. as it was already shown before, hn <dig> demonstrated a higher decrease in cellular viability following treatment with ionizing radiation and 5-fluorouracil  compared to hn <dig>  <cit> . to further characterize the two cell lines in this study we conducted array comparative genomic hybridization cgh  analysis, spectral karyotyping , p <dig> and egfr sequencing analysis as well as egfr and epcam surface expression.table  <dig> characteristics of primary hnscc cell cultures

further, sequencing analysis revealed no mutations of egfr in both cell cultures, but two point mutations of the p <dig> gene in hn <dig> . both cell cultures strongly overexpressed egfr and epcam compared to okf6-htert keratinocytes as determined by flow cytometry surface staining .

mirna and mrna expression following radiochemotherapy treatment
in order to analyze common features and differences in the radiochemotherapy response on the mirna and mrna level, expression changes were assessed following treatment in both primary cell lines. significantly deregulated mirnas in the primary cells after radiochemotherapy treatment were previously reported by summerer et al.  <cit> . a heatmap of the expression profiles of the top  <dig> deregulated mirnas revealed distinctive patterns for the two different tumor cell cultures  as well as for untreated and treated samples  resulting in significant or close to significant clustering  . in hn <dig>  <dig> significantly deregulated mirnas were identified while hn <dig> showed deregulated expression of  <dig> mirnas with an overlap of  <dig> mirnas between the two cell cultures.fig.  <dig> unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the expression levels of the top  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in untreated and radiochemotherapy treated hn <dig> and hn <dig> primary hnscc cells. control samples  were treated with dmso and sham-irradiated, treated samples  were treated with 5-fu and irradiated with 2 × 2 gy. a and b represent technical replicates;  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> represent biological replicates



global mrna expression was measured for both cultures after radiochemotherapy or sham-treatment and unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression patterns using the  <dig> mrnas with the highest variance resulted in two main clusters separating samples of the two cell cultures . further, the cluster analysis revealed significant or border line significant separation of control samples and treated samples  .fig.  <dig> unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the expression levels of the top  <dig> differentially expressed mrnas in untreated and radiochemotherapy treated hn <dig> and hn <dig> primary hnscc cells. control samples  were treated with dmso and sham-irradiated, treated samples  were treated with 5-fu and irradiated with 2 × 2 gy. a and b represent technical replicates;  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> represent biological replicates



for hn <dig>  <dig> genes  and for hn <dig>  <dig> genes  were significantly  deregulated after radiochemotherapy treatment with an overlap of  <dig> genes between both primary cultures.

pathway enrichment analysis
for a comprehensive insight in the cellular pathways, which were affected by the radiochemotherapy treatment, a pathway enrichment analysis was applied based on the significantly deregulated mrnas. the analysis exhibited dna damage/telomere stress induced senescence, direct p <dig> effectors, cholesterol biosynthesis, dissolution of fibrin clot, unfolded protein response and apoptotic execution phase as overlap of significantly  enriched pathways . differences in the treatment response between the two primary cultures are reflected by pathways such as tgf-beta signaling pathway, regulation of nuclear smad2/ <dig> signaling, tnf signaling pathway and il6-mediated signaling events, which play a role only in the treatment response in hn <dig>  but not in hn <dig> 

mirna-mrna interactions
we further aimed to identify potential mirna-mrna interactions that are part of the treatment response in order to gain information on the function of the treatment-responsive mirnas. integrative network analysis of significantly deregulated mirnas and differentially expressed mrnas including adjustment with validated mirna-mrna interactions derived from the mirtarbase  <cit>  resulted in functional mirna-mrna networks affected by radiochemotherapy treatment in hn <dig>  and hn <dig> . the mirnas appearing in the interaction networks of both primary cell lines and their corresponding target mrnas are combined in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> mirna-mrna interaction network reflecting the response to radiochemotherapy treatment in hn <dig>  mirna-mrna pairs were generated based on the correlation coefficient  of their expression levels. mirnas are shown in purple, potential target genes are shown in green. arrows indicate the direction of regulation. the numbers refer to the correlation value of the respective mirna and mrna expression levels

characterization of the role of therapy-responsive circulating mirnas on cellular pathways
as it was already shown by summerer et al.  <cit> , several mirnas significantly deregulated in the presented radiochemotherapy cell culture model were also detectable as circulating deregulated mirnas in hnscc patients after radiochemotherapy. in order to gain information on the function of these therapy-responsive mirnas  all mrnas that showed negatively correlating expression values  in the primary cell cultures and additionally representing validated targets in the mirtarbase were determined . pathway enrichment analysis  of these potential target genes revealed predominantly signaling molecules that represent direct p <dig> effectors and play a role in pathways in cancer, cell cycle and the e2f transcription factor network . the key players of these pathways were e2f <dig>  pten, akt <dig>  jun, hsp90aa <dig>  kat2b in hn <dig> and jun, kat2b, birc <dig>  ccnd <dig>  rbl <dig> in hn <dig> table  <dig> pathway enrichment analysis of potential target genes in hn <dig> for mirnas responding to therapy in hnscc patients

discussion
in the present study we applied an integrative approach for the delineation of the effects of radiochemotherapy on the molecular processes in a hnscc cell culture model. based on these data, we analyzed the cellular pathways affected by the treatment. the usefulness of this approach for the identification of regulatory networks has already been demonstrated in previous studies  <cit> . for the first time we used this approach on a cell culture model with primary hnscc cells mimicking a common therapy regime for hnscc  <cit> . in this way we aimed for a better understanding of the treatment response, with respect to a common and individually varying molecular response.

the observed overlap of deregulated mirnas and mrnas between hn <dig> and hn <dig> hints to a partially common response to radiochemotherapy treatment. at the same time, the separation of the two primary hnscc cell cultures in distinct clusters for both, the top  <dig> deregulated mirnas  and mrnas , suggests individual differences in the response to the treatment. this is consistent with differences between hn <dig> and hn <dig> in the sensitivity towards radiochemotherapy treatment as shown before  <cit> . the short-term effect on cellular viability following radiochemotherapy treatment became apparent only in hn <dig>  but not in hn <dig>  <cit> . variations in the treatment response may be attributed to inter-tumor heterogeneity among the various types of hnscc  <cit>  with regard to the tumor site and the molecular profile of the tumors  <cit> . accordingly, array cgh detected alterations in both primary cultures that are typical for hnscc, such as gains on 5p, 8q, 11q, 9q and 20pq as well as losses on 3p and 18q  . in addition, alterations that were unique to one of the primary cell cultures, such as chromosomal bands on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which were affected only in hn <dig> but not in hn <dig>  were observed. structural rearrangements involving chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that were detected in hn <dig> or hn <dig> are in accordance with previous karyotyping investigations of hnscc  <cit> . in addition, so far unpublished rearrangements on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were discovered in the two primary cell cultures. altogether, the cytogenetic analysis demonstrated that both primary cultures consisted of a rather homogenous cell population since most of the chromosomal alterations were shown to be clonal.

we further analyzed the mutational status of p <dig> and egfr since mutations in p <dig> are common in head and neck cancers  <cit>  and egfr represents a key oncogene in hnscc  <cit> . egfr did not show any mutations in both primary cultures, whereas hn <dig> showed a p <dig> mutation in the sh <dig> ligand  and a nonsense mutation  in the tetramerization domain . the polymorphism at position  <dig>  in p <dig> affects the interaction between some p <dig> mutants and p <dig>  a p <dig> homologue that can transcriptionally activate p <dig> target genes  <cit> . the binding ability of p <dig> and p <dig> affects the response to chemotherapy in vitro, which points to a possible impact of the polymorphism in codon  <dig> on the chemosensitivity of tumor cells. the second p <dig> mutation  leads to a truncated protein, due to a stop codon in the td. most of the mutations in the td lead to defects in oligomerization of p <dig>  dna binding, stimulation of the transcription of reporter genes and growth inhibition of tumor cells  <cit> . it has been shown that deletion of the td, which impairs the ability of p <dig> to tetramerize, does not abolish its ability to bind dna and to stimulate transcription, but significantly decreases the overall affinity of p <dig> for dna, thus destabilizing the p53-dna complexes  <cit> .

since egfr is known to be overexpressed in up to 90 % of hnscc  <cit>  we determined the egfr expression levels of hn <dig> and hn <dig> in comparison to normal human keratinocytes . both primary hnscc cultures demonstrated increased relative expression of egfr , which implies a potential impact of egfr signaling suggesting an egfr-targeted treatment for an improved therapy response. additionally, the epithelial cell adhesion molecule , which is frequently overexpressed in hnscc  <cit> , showed higher expression in hn <dig> and hn <dig> cells relative to okf6-htert cells . epcam acts as a marker for metastasis and proliferation representing another potential target for the therapeutic response.

the two primary cell cultures, hn <dig> and hn <dig>  in part showed the same molecular response to radiochemotherapy treatment. the similarities became clear after pathway enrichment analysis that resulted in six common pathways affected by combined treatment with ionizing radiation and 5-fu. among these, the pathway direct effectors of p <dig> is likely to represent effects of both ionizing radiation and 5-fu treatment. 5-fu is known to stabilize and activate p <dig> promoting p53-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . p <dig> is also activated by radiation-induced dna-damage  <cit>  and therefore represents an important cell cycle checkpoint. another pathway affected by the treatment in our study was apoptotic execution phase including histones and molecules involved in dna fragmentation and chromatin condensation. a further pathway, which was involved in the treatment response of both primary cell cultures, was dna damage/telomere stress induced senescence. it is mainly based on histones that were damaged by the treatment and might reflect effects of ionizing radiation on the dna structure. molecules acting in the cholesterol biosynthesis also showed deregulation in both primary cell cultures, suggesting an involvement of membranes, probably due to an effect of 5-fu on lipids  <cit> . further, the appearance of dissolution of fibrin clot as a result of the pathway analysis implies that cellular migration and inflammation was affected by the treatment since plasminogen activators and inhibitors regulate cellular adhesion and migration as well as inflammatory response  <cit> . unfolded protein response was another pathway playing a role in the cellular treatment response due to deregulated chaperones, which are part of the cellular stress response  <cit> . apart from that, we were able to validate deregulation of mir-183-5p and its target gene asns following radiochemotherapy . activation of asns transcription is part of the unfolded protein response and enhances the cellular resistance to drug treatment. thus it represents a potential prognostic factor for the outcome of radiochemotherapy  <cit> .

the mirna-mrna networks showing interactions that are part of the treatment response revealed three commonly deregulated mirnas, mir-7-5p, mir-17-5p and mir-93-5p, in the two primary cell lines. for these mirnas interactions with several target genes were validated for each primary cell line, which proves the significance of the treatment-responsive mirna-mrna interactions.

genes, which are already known as key players in the response to 5-fu treatment, also appeared in the mirna-mrna networks of the two primary cell cultures. in particular, 5-fu is an anti-metabolite and inhibits thymidilate synthase, which catalyzes the synthesis of thymidylate and is an essential component of dna replication and repair  <cit> . slc19a <dig> and dhfr are part of the folate metabolism, which is necessary for the reaction catalyzed by thymidilate synthase, and therefore they might represent predictive markers for the efficacy of 5-fu treatment  <cit> . molecules, such as asns or dhfr, that show a response to treatment are potential candidates for stratification of patients with regard to their sensitivity to anti-tumor treatment and might be targets in a specific group of patients for a combinatorial treatment approach in order to enhance therapy success  <cit> . a systems-based prediction of such combinatorial treatment approaches has recently been reported for colon cancer by klinger et al.  <cit> , which would be also very promising in the case of hnscc. based on the current study such a systems analysis of hnscc cells in response to additional inhibitors and perturbations becomes feasible.

despite many common features, differences in the molecular treatment response between the two primary cultures were observed. the pathway enrichment analysis of treatment-responsive genes revealed pathways that were only affected in one of the two primary cell cultures. the tgf-beta signaling pathway was affected in hn <dig> as well as the regulation of nuclear smad2/ <dig> signaling. the two pathways are closely connected since both smad <dig> and smad <dig> are regulated by tgf-beta  <cit> . tgf-beta signaling is involved in cellular processes such as cell growth, cell differentiation and apoptosis. further pathways that distinguished the response of the two primary cell cultures were tnf signaling pathway and il6-mediated signaling events. these pathways are both part of inflammatory processes which might point to an immunological response to treatment in hn <dig> cells. the cytokines tgf-beta, il <dig> and tnf-alpha are all well-known biomarkers for treatment complications and prognosis of radiochemotherapy success  <cit> . accordingly, the mirna analysis revealed many mirnas regulating immune response and inflammatory molecules deregulated in hn <dig>  but not in hn <dig>  for example, mir-18a-5p, mir-106b-5p, mir-92a-3p and mir-125b-5p are known to play a role in inflammation or immune system  <cit>  and showed a treatment response only in hn <dig>  moreover, upregulation of mir-181b-5p following treatment was validated in hn <dig>  mir-181b-5p is an oncogenic mirna known to be overexpressed in hnscc and represents a previously reported link between inflammation and cancer  <cit> . taking all these differences between hn <dig> and hn <dig> concerning the pathways involved in the molecular treatment response into account, some of the discovered pathways might be important for prognosis of the individual therapy success. as a consequence this novel knowledge may be used to deduce more individualized treatment strategies, e.g. targeting inflammatory pathways which might lead to a better treatment response  <cit> .

the fact that four mirnas  that have already been shown to be therapy-responsive in blood plasma of hnscc patients  <cit>  were also deregulated in the cell culture model, demonstrates the clinical impact of this study and links the results of the cell culture model to our in vivo findings. therefore, we identified all possible target molecules of these mirnas by correlation analysis of mirna and mrna expression values, including only target interactions that are validated in the mirtarbase  <cit> . the four mirnas were previously described to play a role in cancer and represent potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. mir-106b-5p and mir-21-5p were suggested as biomarkers in laryngeal carcinoma  <cit> . moreover, mir-106b-5p has been shown to promote cell migration and invasion by targeting pten  <cit>  while mir-21-5p is overexpressed in various cancer types and was reported as a prognostic biomarker in head and neck cancer  <cit> . mir-425-5p and mir-93-5p are known as regulators in cell proliferation  <cit> . mir-93-5p is also targeting the pten/akt signaling pathway, thus influencing drug sensitivity of cancer cells  <cit> . the pathway enrichment analysis based on the target genes of these mirnas revealed mostly signaling molecules that represent direct p <dig> effectors such as pten, jun and e2f <dig> as well as cell cycle regulators such as rbl <dig>  ccnd <dig>  rrm <dig> and e2f <dig>  the e2f transcription factor network including genes such as e2f <dig>  rrm <dig>  rbl <dig>  kat2b represents a crucial target of the four selected mirnas in both primary hnscc cultures, which might be due to the fact that e2f <dig> impacts thymidilate synthase expression, which is a major target of 5-fu as already discussed  <cit> . furthermore, several studies report an influence of deregulation of the e2f transcription factor network on the chemoradiation sensititvity of cancer cells . most of the genes, that are involved in many of the significantly enriched pathways, also play a role in pathways in cancer such as pten, jun, akt <dig>  hsp90aa <dig>  the latter of which was already described to influence radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity  <cit> . also pten is a well-known radiosensitizer enhancing cell death through akt signaling  <cit> . the results presented in this study open up the possibility of new treatment strategies that target the therapy-responsive signaling pathways either directly or on the level of the mirnas regulating the signaling molecules.

CONCLUSIONS
important progress in strategies for treatment of hnscc has been made over the past decades, however, dose escalation studies revealed that classical radiochemotherapy has reached some sort of dead end  <cit> . therefore, a combination of radiochemotherapy with molecularly targeted agents might open up new therapeutic possibilities. this requires the identification of prognostic targets that enable individualized treatment strategies and allow prevention of excessive therapy.

in the present study we showed that the main pathways affected by radiochemotherapy in two different hnscc primary cultures are related to cell cycle and proliferation, cell death and stress response. as a difference between the two cell cultures we discovered an emphasis on inflammation in the treatment response of hn <dig>  this suggests the use of inflammatory pathways for stratification of hnscc patients in order to identify individuals who might benefit from an additional therapy targeting inflammatory pathways.

similar pathways emerged from the analysis of potential targets of four mirnas that showed a treatment response in the plasma of hnscc patients and the cell culture model, suggesting potential molecular therapeutic targets in the e2f transcription factor network and the pten/akt signaling pathway. this leads to the conclusion that promising prognostic markers and molecules for a targeted therapy approach in hnscc patients are most likely to be found among those signaling molecules which needs to be further investigated on clinical samples.
