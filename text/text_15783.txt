BACKGROUND
plants constantly have to cope with phosphate  limiting conditions and one strategy to overcome pi limitation is the development of a mutualistic association called arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis , which is formed by most land plants and fungi of the phylum glomeromycota. ams can enhance phosphate uptake and growth of the plant  and is named for the formation of intracellular tree like structures called arbuscules. arbuscules are mostly formed in the inner cortical cell layer of mycorrhizal roots and are always surrounded by the plant-derived periarbuscular membrane , the site of nutrient exchange . the formation of ams is initiated after a chemical dialogue between the host plant and symbiont . the plant secretes strigolactones, a group of plant hormones known to stimulate of fungal spore germination and hyphal branching . in return, the fungus releases a complex mixture of lipochito-oligosaccharides, called myc-lcos or myc-factors, which stimulate the formation of ams and induces lateral root formation in the legume plant medicago truncatula .

strigolactone synthesis and secretion is induced by pi limitation . biosynthesis of strigolactones requires the gras type transcription factors nodulation signaling pathway   <dig> and nsp <dig>  and nsp1nsp <dig> double mutants show a reduced colonization by mycorrhizal fungi . interestingly, nsp <dig> and nsp <dig> are key components of the nod-factor signaling pathway leading to root nodule formation . recent results  suggest that nsp <dig> is also involved in ams. the authors showed that nsp <dig> mutant plants do not respond to myc-lcos and are less colonized. furthermore, nsp <dig> interacts with another gras transcription factor required for arbuscular mycorrhization   <dig>  and controls the expression of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase ram <dig>  mutations in both genes lead to strongly reduced colonization by rhizophagus irregularis. interestingly, colonization with the pathogenic oomycete phytophthora palmivora is also impaired in ram <dig> and ram <dig> mutants  . the important role of nsp <dig> in strigolactone biosynthesis, rns and ams implies that nsp <dig> is an integral component of the common signaling pathway . therefore, it can be expected that the spatial and temporal expression of nsp <dig> is tightly controlled.

micro rnas  are key regulators of gene expression and act by target transcript cleavage and/or translational repression . these small non-coding rna molecules are predominantly 21 nt in size and have an important role in regulating developmental processes, hormonal signaling, organ polarity, rna metabolism, and abiotic and biotic stresses of the plant . some mirnas, e.g. mir <dig> and mir <dig>  have also been found to be involved in root nodule symbiosis . first evidence that mirnas are also involved in ams came from the observation that multiple mirnas, e.g. mir <dig>  are differentially regulated in the shoots and roots of mycorrhizal m. truncatula, tobacco and tomato plants . cloning and deep sequencing of the small rnas and the degradome of mycorrhizal m. truncatula roots identified many mirnas and their target mrnas, of which several were differentially expressed in mycorrhizal roots . interestingly, a novel member of the mirna <dig> family, mir171h, was shown to target nsp <dig> . given the above-mentioned role of nsp <dig>  mir171h has been implicated in regulating root endosymbiosis by controlling a key component of the sym-pathway . this assumption has been strengthened by showing mirna171h expression affects the mycorrhizal colonization, is induced by myc-lcos, and is conserved among mycotrophic plants . also, it was shown that the expression of both, mir171h and nsp <dig>  is induced upon cytokinin treatment and that this regulation is dependent on cytokinin response <dig>  . cytokinins and cre <dig> are involved in nodule organogenesis , but cytokinins have also been implicated to be involved in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis . additionally, a recent study employing deep sequencing of lotus japonicus nodules revealed a non-canonical mir <dig> isoform, related to medicago mir171h, which targets ljnsp <dig> . these results indicate an additional regulating role of mir171h in nodule symbiosis, however a direct involvement could not be demonstrated so far .

in this study we show that mir171h negatively regulates both types of root endo-symbioses through perception of the nutritional status of the host plant and shows a mutually exclusive expression pattern with its target nsp <dig> in the root cortex of m. truncatula plants.

RESULTS
expression of an 811 bp mir171h primary transcript mediates nsp <dig> transcript cleavage in vivo
to confirm the functionality of the predicted 811 bp primary transcript of mir171h  and the potential to silence nsp <dig> in vivo, we applied mirna sensor constructs. three different constructs were applied . the first construct, mir171h-gfp, contained an 811 bp fragment of the mir171h primary transcript , which was constitutively expressed by a 35s-promoter. the construct includes an independent and constitutively expressed egfper as a visual transformation control. the second construct, mir171h binding site -nsp <dig>  represented the actual mirna sensor. it was composed of a 35s-promoter driven mrfp fused to five repeats of the mir171h binding site of nsp <dig>  as a control, the mbs of nsp <dig> was mutated to a scrambled sequence , which was unable to bind mir171h. the constructs were used in agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated tobacco leaf infiltration assays and the mrfp fluorescence around the infiltration site was monitored . when mbs-nsp <dig> was co-infiltrated with mir171h-gfp, the mrfp fluorescence was abolished. the fluorescence was restored when mbs-mut and mir171h-gfp were co-infiltrated, indicating that the loss of mrfp fluorescence was specifically due to mir171h-mediated sensor cleavage. the loss of fluorescence was due to drastically reduced mrfp protein levels in mir171h-gfp co-infiltrated tobacco leaves of mbs-nsp <dig> compared to mbs-mut and single infiltration . these results confirmed that nsp <dig> is regulated by mir171h through specific binding of this mirna to its previously identified binding site and is consistent with previous degradome results  and race experiments .

mir171h and nsp <dig> transcript levels are affected by the symbiotic status of the root and by p and n levels
previous studies suggested that mir171h is induced in the root elongation zone of mycorrhizal roots and that nsp <dig> transcript levels are slightly repressed in mycorrhizal roots . also, mir171h transcription is directly induced by high phosphate nutrition . to investigate the transcriptional regulation of nsp <dig> and mir171h in more detail, we analyzed both transcript levels in response to mycorrhizal symbiosis and root nodulation, and under different phosphate and nitrogen fertilization treatments. for this purpose we compared the abundance of mature mir171h to the relative transcript abundance of nsp <dig> after normalization to full nutrition  conditions . as expected, mir171h accumulation was repressed by phosphate starvation , i.e. positively influenced by high phosphate conditions. it also increases in nodulated roots, in which case it is further enhanced by nitrogen starvation. these results indicate that both nsp <dig> and mir171h show a complex regulation of their transcription, which depends on the symbiotic status of the roots and the nutrient fertilization regime.

nsp <dig> transcript levels in mycorrhizal roots are elevated despite of increased mir171h expression
a clear anti-correlation  of mir171h and nsp <dig> accumulation was present in all but the mycorrhizal condition . in the conditions used, nsp <dig> shows the highest relative transcript abundance in mycorrhizal roots as compared to all other conditions tested.

to investigate the mir171h and nsp <dig> expression in mycorrhizal roots over a time-course of am symbiosis development, an experiment of 6 weeks was carried out and rna accumulation of marker genes for am symbiosis development and function were analyzed . this clearly showed that the expression of pri-mir171h increases in mycorrhizal roots from 2 weeks post inoculation on, as compared to non-mycorrhizal roots under the applied conditions . additionally, the time-course confirms elevated nsp <dig> transcript levels in mycorrhizal roots, despite of enhanced mir171h accumulation. therefore we assume that the abundance of nsp <dig> transcript levels in mycorrhizal roots is maintained by a mir171h-independent factor.

to further investigate the nsp <dig> transcript levels in mycorrhizal roots, we analyzed if nsp <dig> transcript level shows a correlation to mtpt <dig> transcript levels in individual plants. mtpt <dig> encodes a phosphate transporter specifically expressed in arbuscule-containing cells  and can be regarded as a marker for a functional am symbiosis. we found a clear positive correlation  of nsp <dig> and mtpt <dig> transcript levels . this supports the assumption that nsp <dig> is induced in mycorrhizal roots by a mycorrhiza-dependent factor.

the suppression of functional symbiotic structures by high phosphate fertilization is independent of nsp2
mir171h transcript levels are increased in plants supplied with high phosphate concentrations. additionally, at high phosphate conditions mycorrhizal colonization is often decreased as compared to plants grown at phosphate starvation and additionally results in less functional symbiotic structures, namely arbuscules . therefore, is might be assumed that the suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis at high phosphate conditions is dependent on the mir171h-nsp <dig> regulon. to address this question, we inoculated wild type and nsp <dig> mutant plants with r. irregularis growing in phosphate starvation  or high phosphate  conditions. transcript levels of mtpt <dig> as a marker for a functional am symbiosis were measured at three weeks after inoculation. mycorrhizal wild-type plants and nsp <dig> mutants showed significantly decreased levels of mtpt <dig> expression when grown at high phosphate fertilization , which indicates a significant lower frequency of functional symbiotic structures of both lines. hence, suppression of mycorrhizal colonization by high phosphate fertilization is independent of nsp <dig> 

induced expression of mir171h at high phosphate conditions is not dependent on cre1
a recent study of cis regulatory elements of the nsp <dig> promoter gave evidence that nsp <dig>  as well mir171h, transcription is directly influenced by cytokinin and depends on the cytokinin receptor cre <dig> . to analyze whether the induction of mir171h at high phosphate and nsp <dig> induction in mycorrhizal roots is dependent on cre1-mediated cytokinin perception, we investigated the relative expression levels of mir171h and nsp <dig> in both conditions using cre1- <dig> mutant plants and wild-type control plants.

the cre1- <dig> mutation has subtle effect on the nsp <dig> transcript abundance compared to wild-type plants in regard to the increased expression in mycorrhizal plants . on the one hand, only the increase of the nsp <dig> transcript abundance in wild-type plants is statistically significant  compared to cre1- <dig> plants, whereas on the other hand there is no statistical significance between wild-type and cre1- <dig> plants at mycorrhizal conditions. this might indicate that the transcriptional induction of nsp <dig> in mycorrhizal roots is not directly dependent of cre <dig>  however we cannot rule out that nsp <dig> expression levels might be indirectly influenced by cre <dig> during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. we also investigated the effect of cre1- <dig> on the am symbiosis by monitoring the relative transcript levels of the mycorrhizal marker genes mtpt <dig> and ritef . expression level of both genes did not differ between mycorrhizal cre1- <dig> and wild type plants  at 4 weeks post inoculation , which indicates that cre1- <dig> mutants are not impaired in mycorrhizal development. that is also supported by a similar correlation between nsp <dig> and mtpt <dig> relative transcript levels in cre1- <dig> plants compared to the wild type . in contrast to the nodule symbiosis, where cre <dig> is clearly involved in mir171h and nsp <dig> regulation , these results do not clearly demonstrate that the induction of nsp <dig> in mycorrhizal roots is directly mediated by cre <dig>

both cre1- <dig> and wild type plants showed a significant increase in the amount of mir171h at high pi conditions  compared to either non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal low pi conditions  . at high phosphate conditions, no significant difference in the relative abundance of mir171h between cre1- <dig> and wild type plants could be observed, indicating that the phosphate-induced expression of mir171h is not mediated by cre <dig> 

reporter fusions confirm the complex and spatial regulation of nsp2- and mir171h- promoter activities
an increased level of both nsp <dig> and mir171h in mycorrhizal roots suggests that these transcripts might be spatially separated in roots. we therefore used promoter-reporter fusions to localize the promoter activity of mir171h and nsp <dig> in roots grown at different nutritional and symbiotic conditions. a 1248 bp fragment upstream of the nsp <dig> coding sequence and a 900 bp fragment upstream of the mir171h primary transcript were fused to a β-glucuronidase  reporter gene. both promoter-reporter constructs were transformed into m. truncatula roots by agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation.

as expected from the transcript accumulation pattern, promoter activity pattern of both mir171h and nsp <dig> showed drastic changes in response to different phosphate and nitrate fertilization treatments . at phosphate starvation, the promoter of mir171h was mainly active in the central cylinder and the endodermis . however, after colonization with r. irregularis, a weak gus signal was detectable in distinct, but not in all, arbuscule-containing cells . the nsp <dig> promoter also showed a strong activity in the central cylinder and endodermis during phosphate starvation. in addition, the nsp <dig> promoter showed a weak activity in cortical cells of non-mycorrhizal roots , whereas in mycorrhizal roots an additional strong activity was observed in the epidermal cell layer, root hairs and in some arbuscule-containing cells of the root .
nsp2
and the mir171h promoter show distinct regulation in response to nutrients and mycorrhizal colonization. roots were transformed with promoter-uida fusions of either the mir171h  or the nsp <dig> promoter. after root transformation, chimeric plants were potted into substrate and grown under different nutritional regimes: phosphate starvation , phosphate starvation and mycorrhizal colonization , nitrogen starvation  or full nutrition . a, a’ and a” as well as e, e’ and e’ represent identical root sections, with a’/e’ showing wga alexafluor  <dig> fluorescence to visualize r. irregularis structures and a”/e” showing overlay of bright filed images and wga alexafluor  <dig> fluorescence. scale bars represent 100 μm  or 200 μm . arrowheads point to gus staining in cortical cells containing arbuscules.

this observation might be a reasonable explanation for the above mentioned increased transcript abundance of nsp <dig> in mycorrhizal roots . during nitrogen starvation no major mir171h-promoter activity could be observed except in some isolated cortical cells , which might represent spontaneous promoter activity or staining artifacts. increased mir171h expression seen during rns  therefore is not due to the lack of nitrogen fertilization. in contrast to mir171h, the nsp <dig> promoter showed a more complex activity pattern in roots of nitrogen-starved plants. parts of the roots showed nsp <dig> promoter activity in apparently random patterns in the cortex cells and endodermis , whereas in different parts of the same root the promoter activity was observed in the whole cortex . at full nutrition condition the mir171h  and nsp <dig> promoter  showed contrasting localizations, where the mir171h promoter was active in all root cells with the strongest signals in the central cylinder. in turn, the nsp <dig> promoter was not active in the root epidermis and cortex but active in the central cylinder and endodermis. the results of the promoter gus study in root sections are illustrated in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

next we analyzed the promoter activity of mir171h and nsp <dig> in root nodules of plants grown at high phosphate, without nitrate and inoculated with sinorhizobium meliloti. representative young and mature nodules are shown in figure  <dig>  the mir171h promoter showed only weak activity in young nodules  but in mature nodules an increased activity was visible at the nodule tip with the strongest activity matching the meristematic zone and getting gradually weaker in the direction of the subsequent infection and nitrogen fixation zones . it is worth mentioning that the root cortex cells flanking the nodules showed strong gus activity, which is in contrast to non-inoculated control roots where no promoter activity was observed in the root cortex .
nsp2
and the mir171h promoter show distinct expression domains in root nodules. roots were transformed with promoter-uida fusions of either the mir171h  or the nsp <dig>  promoter. after root transformation, chimeric plants were potted into substrate and grown under nitrogen starvation additionally colonized with s. meliloti. pictures show either developing nodules  or mature nodules  from the same plants harvested at  <dig> wpi. scale bars represent 500 μm. arrowhead points to a vascular bundle.

the nsp <dig> promoter was active in young and mature nodules with the strongest activity in the tip of young nodules and the vascular bundles of mature nodules . similar to the mir171h promoter, the nsp <dig> promoter was also active in the root cortex in the vicinity of young and mature nodules.

these results demonstrate that the promoter activities of nsp <dig> and mir171h are mainly mutually exclusive and are affected by phosphate as well as nitrate fertilization and by root colonization with r. irregularis and s. meliloti.

mature mir171h accumulates the meristematic zone of root nodules
to localize the site of mature mir171h accumulation in mycorrhizal and nodulated roots, we used in situ hybridization with a mir171h-specific lna probe . an lna probe with a scrambled nucleotide sequence served as a negative control. consistent with the location of the mir171h promoter activity, we found an accumulation of mature mir171h in the central cylinder of mycorrhizal roots . we found only weak signals of mature mir171h accumulation in all arbuscule-containing cells, however the mir171h promoter activity was only observed in distinct arbuscule-containing cells . based on the low signal to background ration it is not possible to draw a clear conclusion of its localization but its likely to be in arbuscule containing cells. localization of the mature mirna in root nodules was in agreement with the observed promoter activity pattern in mature nodules. mature mir171h molecules accumulated to the meristematic zone of nodules with the signal intensity gradually decreasing towards the infection zone. no mir171h accumulation could be detected in the nitrogen fixation zone . these results show that mature mir171h accumulation is consistent with its spatial origin of transcription and point to a protective role of mir171h against target mis-expression in root nodules and probably arbuscule containing cells.

over-expression of mir171h leads to a reduced mycorrhizal colonization and reduced nodule numbers
to analyze the biological function of the observed spatial regulation of nsp <dig> and mir171h transcription, we ectopically over-expressed mir171h in m. truncatula roots. for this purpose, m. truncatula roots were transformed with the construct, mir171h-gfp , already used for the leaf infiltration assay to drive the constitutive expression of pri-mir171h. the empty vector was used as a control. the root-transformed plants were either inoculated with r. irregularis or s. meliloti to analyze the impact of mir171h over-expression on ams or rns, respectively. at 5 weeks post inoculation, over-expression of pri-mir171h led to a very strong accumulation of mature mir171h resulting in a drastic reduction of nsp <dig> transcript levels . in addition, we also observed a reduction in mtdwarf <dig> transcript abundance, which is a downstream target of nsp <dig> and important for converting the strigolactone orobanchol into didehydro-orobanchol . interestingly, we found significantly reduced intraradicular rrna level of r. irregularis but not of mtpt <dig> transcript level, which is similar to the unchanged mtpt <dig> transcript levels in mycorrhizal roots of nsp2- <dig> mutant plants . the microscopic analysis of the mycorrhizal phenotype  showed a concomitant reduction in the mycorrhizal intensity to similar levels as the nsp2- <dig> mutant line , but no significant reduction of the arbuscule abundance was observed in the pri-mir171h overexpressing plants . this implies that plant roots which over-accumulated mature mir171h were less colonized by the mycorrhizal fungus whereas arbuscule development in colonized root areas was not impaired. additionally, we also found significantly reduced nodule numbers in roots over-expressing mature mir171h compared to the vector controls .

in summary, ectopic overexpression of the primary mir171h transcript in roots of m. truncatula is leading to a phenotype analogous to the nsp2- <dig> mutant phenotype during mycorrhizal and nodule symbiosis.

discussion
one of the recently identified mirnas, which specifically target genes essential for root endosymbiosis is mtr-mir171h .

mir171h has later been predicted to be produced from an 811 bp long primary transcript encoding two mir171h loci on a single arm of its fold-back structure . in this work, we provided experimental proof that mir171h is functionally expressed from an at least 811 bp long primary transcript. cleavage of nsp <dig> transcripts by mir171h has been verified by race-based methods . however, so far functional analysis of mir171h has been carried out with the primarily identified partial precursor encoding only a single mirna duplex . by using a specific mirna-sensor construct in a n. benthamiana leaf infiltration assay we could confirm in-vivo that the long double duplex-containing mir171h primary transcript exhibits biological activity. this suggests that the long primary transcript described by branscheid et al.  resembles the endogenous source of mature mir171h in m. truncatula.

the target of mir171h, nsp <dig>  is a gras-type transcription factor, which is essential for the formation of root nodule symbiosis , strigolactone biosynthesis  and is involved in the myc-factor signaling pathway . it has been recently shown that mir171h overexpression leads to a reduction of mycorrhizal root colonization  and it has been proposed to act specifically in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. expression data of mir171h implies that this mirna is induced by full nutrition conditions  and we hypothesized that mir171h is regulated by the phosphate status of the plant. data from arabidopsis and rapeseed did not imply that the mir <dig> family is regulated by phosphate and nitrogen availability . however, the data from the current study give strong evidence that the expression of mir171h is mainly induced by high phosphate availability . it is possible that the phosphate dependent regulation of a mir <dig> family member is dependent of the ability to undergo root endosymbiosis, because the mir171h isoform is only present in ams capable plants . whether additional mir <dig> family members are phosphate responsive in these plant species is not known. interestingly, the promoter gus reporter assays suggest that the expression of mir171h is not merely regulated by phosphate per se but rather by a combination of phosphate and nitrogen levels, because the activity of the mir171h promoter is absent at high phosphate and low nitrogen conditions compared to full nutrition conditions .

recently, it has been shown that mir171h expression is induced by cytokinin treatment and dependent on the cre <dig> pathway  i.e. that the loss of cre <dig> leads to loss of mir171h induction by cytokinins. because it is known that pi and nitrogen fertilization increases cytokinin levels of plants  and elevated levels are also found in shoots and roots of mycorrhizal plants . based on this knowledge we hypothesized that the expression levels of mir171h at high phosphate conditions might be dependent on cre <dig> as a direct effect of induced cytokinin levels in these plants. we used the cre1- <dig> mutant plant line to address this question. the presented results indicate that phosphate dependent regulation of mir171h and its modest induction in mycorrhizal roots is not dependent on cre1; the latter assumption is in agreement with the fact that the cre1- <dig> mutation has no statistically significant effect on the mycorrhizal marker gene expression and thus mycorrhizal colonization . taken together we conclude that the mir171h expression is regulated by the phosphate status of the plant in a nitrogen dependent manner controlled by an unknown genetic factor, in addition to the previously demonstrated inducing effect of myc-lcos .

interestingly, we found elevated transcript levels of nsp <dig> in mycorrhizal roots  between two and six weeks post inoculation. similar to mir171h, the expression of nsp <dig> is induced upon cytokinin treatment in a cre1-dependent manner during high phosphate and low nitrogen conditions . however, the involvement of cre <dig> in the induction of nsp <dig> transcript abundance in mycorrhizal roots during low phosphate and high nitrogen conditions was not as clear as with the cytokinin treatment mentioned above . therefore, we assume that this up-regulation is mediated by an unknown factor and does not involve cytokinin perception per se. we cannot rule out a subtle influence cre <dig> on nsp <dig> expression during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, though mycorrhizal colonization itself is clearly not dependent on the cre1-pathway. the observed increase in nsp <dig> transcript levels is most likely the result of the observed additional promoter activity in the epidermal cell layer of mycorrhizal roots compared to non-mycorrhizal roots  and which lack mir171h promoter activities . we cannot rule out the possibility that this phenomenon is due to the lack of proper loading of argonaute proteins, the major component of the rna induced silencing complex , with mature mir171h, but due to a lack of antibodies against m. truncatula ago <dig> homologues, this assumption awaits to be tested. additionally, nsp <dig> might be preferably repressed by a translational rather than post-transcriptional repression , which would leave the steady-state transcript abundance unchanged. however, owing to the mutually exclusive expression pattern of the mir171h-nsp <dig> target pair during mycorrhizal symbiosis as discussed below, we favor the aforementioned explanation. yet, our observation of an induced nsp <dig> expression during mycorrhizal conditions is in contrast to the previously published results of lauressergues et al.  who observed a slight decrease in nsp <dig> transcript levels in mycorrhizal roots. the exact cause for this discrepancy is not known, but we could show that our results are consistent over  <dig> independent experiments:  by qrt-pcr measurement of nsp <dig> transcript levels based on material 3 weeks post inoculation as shown in figure  <dig>   by qrt-pcr measurement based on material from a time-course over 6 weeks as presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  and  by qrt-pcr measurement based on the parental line of the cre1- <dig> mutant, harboring a wt gene, 4 weeks post inoculation as shown in figure  <dig>  moreover a correlation of single data points derived from individual plants based on the measurement shown in figure  <dig> shows a positive correlation between mtpt <dig>  and nsp <dig>  additionally, we reinvestigated publically available microarray datasets, which are deposited in the medicago gene expression atlas v <dig>  using the probe mtr. <dig> .s1_at, which corresponds to nsp <dig>  although the data of gomez et al.  shows only a slight increase of nsp <dig> in mycorrhizal conditions at best, but no reduction as well, the data of hogekamp et al.  shows a strong increase in the signal of the probe in response to 6 weeks of colonization by r. irregularis or glomus mosseae and a strong decrease in response to 2 mm pi treatment compared to 20 μm treated control conditions. analysis of the supplementary data from hogekamp et al.  in more detail revealed that the increase of nsp <dig> expression in r. irregularis treated roots has a log <dig> fold change of  <dig>   and in g. mosseae  <dig>  , which represents a roughly  <dig> × times induction of nsp <dig> expression during am symbiosis, which is not only in agreement with our data and strongly supports our results, but also indicates that this response is conserved in symbiotic interactions with g. mosseae. as the slight induction in the data of gomez et al.  is not significant and lauressergues et al.  observed a reduction in nsp <dig> levels upon r. irregularis colonization it is clear that there is at least one other unknown factor involved in the regulation of the mir171h-nsp <dig> target pair. these might involve specific regulation by additional mir171h target genes  not investigated in this study, which might be preferably silenced by mir171h instead of nsp <dig> at the conditions tested by us. future detailed analysis of their spatial expression pattern from promoter to the protein level, the latter also accounts for nsp <dig>  might give insight into this conundrum.

when comparing the spatial distribution of the mir171h- and nsp2-promoter, it becomes evident that they predominantly show a mutually exclusive expression pattern, especially at full nutrition  and mycorrhizal conditions . such a pattern has also been described for the mir395-sultr2; <dig> mirna target pair  and most likely functions to prevent expression of transcripts resulting from spontaneous promoter activity in specific tissues and cell types, a mechanism called promoter dampening . that this model applies to the mir171h-nsp <dig> target pair is in agreement with the results from the ectopic mis-expression of mir171h by 35s driven expression which leads to a drastic reduction in nsp <dig> transcript levels and mycorrhizal colonization  as well as with the 35s driven ectopic mis-expression of a mir171h-resistant nsp <dig> version leading to over-colonization of the root system and root apices, whereas ectopic mis-expression of the wild type nsp <dig> transcript, which can be cleaved by mir171h, does not . this mutually exclusive expression pattern is especially pronounced at full nutrition conditions where the mir171h is strongly expressed in all root tissues, whereas the nsp <dig> promoter is completely inactive with the exception of the central cylinder. this assumes that the plant needs to comprehensively ensure a tight nsp <dig> expression control in roots of nutrient replete plants to avoid the formation of root nodule and am symbiosis, especially at full nutrition supply. even though we cannot exclude the possibility that mir171h induction by high phosphate fertilization has an impact on mycorrhizal repression by restricting nsp <dig> expression, we rule out that this effect is solely dependent on mir171h, because nsp2- <dig> plants still respond to high phosphate treatment with repression of mycorrhizal colonization  even though the nsp <dig> dependent regulation is genetically knocked out, indicating that other regulatory circuits act epistatically to the mir171h-nsp <dig> regulatory circuit. additionally, a recent important discovery is that nsp <dig> interacts with another gras-type transcription factor ram <dig>  which is essential for mycorrhizal colonization and hyphopodia formation by controlling the expression of ram <dig> . ram <dig>  a glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase, catalyzes an important step in cutin monomer production, which seems to be an important molecule for promoting hyphopodia attachment to the plant root, and thus can also be hijacked by filamentous pathogenic fungi, e.g. phytophthora palmivora . accordingly, it might be assumed that the mutually exclusive expression pattern of mir171h has been evolved to avoid hijacking of the nsp <dig> signaling pathway by pathogens, creating only a narrow conditional window to allow the formation of beneficial symbiotic interactions, presumably relying on a previous signal from a beneficial symbiotic partner. we therefore conclude that mir171h acts as a promoter dampener, which protects specific cell-types of the root at distinct nutritional and symbiotic conditions from nsp <dig> mis-expression in a mutually exclusive expression pattern, whereas the overall transcript abundance of nsp <dig> in wild-type medicago truncatula roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is mainly determined by its promoter activity rather than direct cleavage by mir171h.

other mirna regulatory circuits often seen by mirna-target pairs beside promoter dampening are spatial restriction and temporal regulation . an exemplary spatial restriction type important in regulating root nodule development has been documented for mir <dig> in m. truncatula . there, mir <dig> restricts the expression of its target mthap2- <dig> to the meristematic zone of the root nodule, to allow correct maturation of the root nodule. the data of our study suggests that spatial restriction seems to be a predominant regulatory mechanism of mir171h during root nodule development, in contrast to the segregated expression pattern discussed above. in root nodules the mir171h and nsp <dig> promoter show an overlapping spatial distribution , with the nsp <dig> promoter being active in the whole nodule. mir171h transcription and accumulation is restricted to the meristematic zone, which was confirmed by in-situ hybridization . ectopic over-expression of the long mir171h primary transcript led to a significant reduction in the number of root nodules  and therefore could demonstrate that mir171h over-expression represses root nodule symbiosis, additional to its described capability to restrict mycorrhizal root colonization . furthermore, a recent study from de luis et al.  in l. japonicus identified a homologue of mir171h, lja-mir171c, in determinate root nodules, which similarly targets ljnsp <dig>  its expression in nodules is dependent on the presence of mesorhizobium loti, which indicates that the regulation of mir171h expression has a higher level of complexity than previously thought. previous attempts to overexpress mir171h and mir171c in m. truncatula and l. japonicus failed, which could be explained by the use of the 35s promoter, which seems to be diminished in arbuscule containing cells  and root nodules  and thus might lead to a variation of the results. our demonstrated phenotype might be explained by a dosage dependent effect of the mir171h overexpression, because the primary transcript used in this study encodes two mir171h duplexes  and thus the maximum abundance has likely been doubled, balancing the lower 35s activity in root nodules. taken together, our data provides profound evidence that mir171h can directly influence the root nodule symbiosis and we hypothesize that mir171h protects the root of the plant from nsp <dig> mis-expression in the meristematic zone of indeterminate nodules and therefore prevents bacterial invasion of this tissue, analogous to the protection of the root tip from colonization with mycorrhizal fungi .

CONCLUSIONS
our data revealed that the spatio-temporal expression of mir171h and nsp <dig> is tightly linked to the nutritional status of the plant and reflecting the different physiological conditions at which both types of endosymbiosis are favored by a host legume plant. together with the results from the overexpression analysis, our data points to an important function of mir171h to integrate the nutrient homeostasis in order to safeguard the expression of nsp <dig> during both, arbuscular mycorrhizal and root nodule symbiosis.
