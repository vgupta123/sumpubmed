BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of nosocomial infections, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. commonly reported methicillin-resistant s. aureus  exhibits resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including β-lactams, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, while community-acquired mrsa is associated with serious infectious disease, sepsis, and pneumonia  <cit> . more recently, vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant s. aureus  strains have emerged in several countries. these factors have rendered successful treatment of these infections increasingly problematic.

s. aureus has survived and thrived over the years in part because of its adaptability and stress response capabilities. it is resistant to a variety of environmental factors, including oxidative, ph, osmotic, antibiotic and temperature stressors  <cit> . two-component regulatory systems  act in response to a stimulus that allows cells to sense and respond to changes in many different environmental conditions. most s. aureus strains are endowed with  <dig> sets of genes that encode tcrss. an additional tcrs is present in the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec in mrsa, and this is linked to the induction of methicillin resistance  <cit> . the well-studied tcrs agr is a positive regulator of exoproteins, including proteases, hemolysins, and toxins  <cit> . other tcrss, such as saesr and arlsr, influence the expression of some virulence factors  <cit> . another system, srrab, is homologous to the bacillus subtilis tcrs resde; it is involved the modulation of anaerobic gene expression and sensitivity to oxygen tension  <cit> . the s. aureus tcrs vrasr is homologous to b. subtilis yvqec, and it modulates cell wall biosynthesis and increased resistance to vancomycin  <cit> . another s. aureus tcrs, nrebc, controls nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase operons  <cit> . more recently, it was reported that the s. aureus tcrs walkr is involved in cell wall metabolism, cell survival, and vancomycin resistance  <cit> .

although most tcrss identified in s. aureus have been well studied, the functions of a few remain elusive or only partially explained. of these, the uncharacterized sav1321/sav <dig>  tcrs demonstrates homology with b. subtilis deskr. deskr has been described as a regulatory system involved in the maintenance of membrane fluidity in response to temperature downshift. with decreasing temperature, the membrane-bound sensor kinase desk phosphorylates its corresponding response regulator, desr, which then binds to a specific recognition sequence in the promoter region of the des gene to activate its transcription  <cit> . finally, activity of the membrane-located fatty acid desaturase des maintains membrane fluidity in the cold  <cit> .

in this study, we generated an s. aureus mutant lacking the sav <dig> locus to examine its role in bacterial physiology and virulence. comparative microarray and proteomic analyses were performed to determine putative members of the sav <dig> regulon.

RESULTS
construction and characterization of the s. aureus sav <dig> knockout mutant
a sav <dig> knockout mutant strain was created from the wild-type  s. aureus mu <dig> using homologous recombination. re-introducing the sav <dig> locus into the sav <dig> mutant generated a complementation strain. the wt sav <dig> locus is shown in fig. 1a. to confirm allelic replacement, chromosomal dna was isolated from the wt, sav <dig> mutant, and complementation strains. pcr analysis, sequencing, and rt-pcr confirmed the mutation .fig.  <dig>

to determine whether deletion of the s. aureus sav <dig> locus had any impact on bacterial growth and morphology, growth curves and colony forming units  were compared at 37 °c. we observed no difference in growth between the wt and the sav <dig> mutant strains at this temperature. similarly, no obvious differences in colony morphology were observed .

temperature stress
to examine the role of the sav <dig> locus in response to heat and cold stress, we compared the growth rates of the wt, sav <dig> mutant, and complementation strains at  <dig> and 46 °c . the sav <dig> mutant grew less at 46 °c when compared with the wt strain. the wt strain exhibited a normal growth curve from inoculation until 3 h, at which point a decline in growth was noted. the complementation strain exhibited a growth curve that was similar to the wt; however, a growth decline was noted after 1 h . at 25 °c, growth of the wt and mutant strains started to increase at 3 h, yet the growth rate for the wt strain was faster than that of the sav <dig> mutant strain. growth of the complementation strain increased continuously, beginning immediately after inoculation at 25 °c . to determine growth arrest or viability in temperature shifts, we measured the cfu of strains every hour after inoculation . at 46 °c, mutant strain maintained the cfu from 1 h to 3 h and declined the viability after 4 h. at 25 °c, all strains maintained the cfu during the measurement . it is suggested that mutant strains exhibited growth arrest in early phase and after declining viability.fig.  <dig> growth rates of the s. aureus mu <dig> , sav <dig> mutant , and complementation  strains at  37 °c,  46 °c, and  25 °c. data are expressed as mean ± sd values for the measurements of absorbance in 600 nm



oxidative stress
to examine the role of the sav <dig> locus during oxidative stress, a disk diffusion assay with two different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide  was performed. when compared with the wt strain, the sav <dig> mutant strain displayed greater resistance to both hydrogen peroxide concentrations tested . sensitivity of the complementation strain to oxidative stress was similar to that of the wt strain for both hydrogen peroxide concentrations tested .fig.  <dig> oxidative stress response of the wild-type  s. aureus mu <dig>  sav <dig> mutant, and complementation strains . data are expressed as mean ± sd values for the zone of inhibition diameter . asterisks denote statistical significance  when compared with the wt strain



microarray transcriptional analysis
all of the microarray data have been deposited in the ncbi’s gene expression omnibus  under accession number gse <dig>  a comparison of the mu <dig> and the sav <dig> mutant transcription profiles revealed differential expression of  <dig> genes . notably, expression of two genes associated with cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis , was lower in the sav <dig> mutant strain. conversely, transcription of the chaperone genes dnaj, dnak, and grpe, as well as the negative heat shock regulator genes, hrca and ctsr, was higher in the sav <dig> mutant strain. furthermore, transcript levels of two genes encoding clp atpases, clpb and clpc, were higher in the sav <dig> mutant strain.table  <dig> representative genes differentially expressed in the wt and sav <dig> mutant strains

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the wt and sav <dig> mutant strains
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to examine differences in protein profiles between wt and sav <dig> cell lysates . we observed that proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism, including those involved in the tricarboxylic acid  cycle exhibit lower expression in the sav <dig> mutant when compared with the wt strain . moreover, several proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were differentially expressed; expression of fructose-biphosphate aldolase  and alcohol dehydrogenase  proteins was greater in the sav <dig> mutant, while expression of transketolase, phosphoglyceromutase , and pyruvate kinase  was lower when compared with the wt strain. we also observed a lower expression levels for l-lactate dehydrogenase  and higher expression of d-lactate dehydrogenase  in the mutant; both of these proteins are associated with the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate.table  <dig> representative proteins differentially expressed in the wt and sav <dig> mutant strains

interestingly, several proteins associated with lipid metabolism and cell wall synthesis also displayed differential expression. in particular, expression of the glycerol kinase, dihydroxyacetone kinase subunit dhak, enoyl- reductase and glycerophophoryl diester phophodiesterase-like protein was lower in the sav <dig> mutant, whereas expression of -hydroxymyristoyl-acp dehydrogenase was higher in the sav <dig> mutant when compared with the wt strain. for cell wall synthesis, glucosamine-fructose-6-phophate aminotransferase , udp-n-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide-d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase , and udp-n-acetylglucosamine-1-carboxylvinyl transferase  exhibited lower expression levels in the sav <dig> mutant when compared with the wt strain. glms is the key enzyme responsible for the synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate  <cit> , murf catalyzes the addition of d-ala-d-ala to the nucleotide precursor udp-n-acetylmuramic acid-l-ala-γ-glu-meso-diaminopimelate  <cit> , and murz catalyzes the condensation of phophoenolpyruvate with udp-n-acetylglucosamine  <cit> .

lastly, markedly lower expression levels of proteins involved in the stress response were observed in the sav <dig> mutant, including the general stress protein 20u , methionine sulfoxide reductase a , and methionine sulfoxide reductase b . msra <dig> reduces the s isomer of methionine sulfoxide, and msrb reduces the r form, providing protection against oxidative stress  <cit> . in contrast, expression of clpl, a protein involved in thermotolerance, was up-regulated in the sav <dig> mutant strain.

in vivo assessment of the sav <dig> mutant strain
a mouse model of bacteremia was used to determine how deletion of the sav <dig> locus impacted staphylococcal pathogenicity. systemic infection following tail vein inoculation of six-week-old female balb/c mice with the sav <dig> mutant produced a 2-log reduction in bacterial burden found in the lung, liver, and kidney when compared with mice inoculated with the wt strain .fig.  <dig> 
s. aureus mu <dig>  and sav <dig> mutant pathogenicity. mice were infected with the wt or sav <dig> mutant strains, and infection progressed for 24 h. cfu  from infected lungs, livers, and kidneys are shown



antibiotic susceptibility
epsilometer -test strips were used to determine if the sav <dig> mutant strain exhibited altered susceptibility or resistance to several antibiotics. minimum inhibitory concentrations  of vancomycin and teicoplanin which target the bacterial cell wall were lower for the sav <dig> mutant when compared to the wt strain . we also performed a population analysis to obtain a more detailed evaluation of changes in susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin. consistent with a lower mic for both of these antibiotics, we observed a decrease in vancomycin- and teicoplain-resistant subpopulations compared with the wt strain . however, those mics were not recovered in the com stain. lower mics for gentamicin, tigecycline, and tetracycline, which inhibit protein synthesis by binding the 30s subunit of ribosome, were also observed in the sav <dig> mutant strain. the mics of these antibiotics were fully recovered in com strain. in addition, the mics for the bacterial cell membrane-targeting lipopeptide antibiotic, daptomycin, were 3 mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l for the wt and sav <dig> mutant strains, respectively. electron microscopy was used to determine if cell wall thickness was associated with the observed reduction in glycopeptide resistance in the mutant strain. the sav <dig> mutant strain has a thinner cell wall  than the wt strain  .table  <dig> antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the wt, sav <dig> mutant, and complementation strains

discussion
the sav1321/sav <dig> tcrs system is a histidine kinase sensor/response regulator in the wild-type s. aureus mu <dig>  however, the functions of sav1321/sav <dig> tcrs-associated genes are not yet known. with this study, we elucidate some of these functions by examining phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes in a sav <dig> mutant strain in response to different environmental stressors.

heat-shock proteins  are essential for stress tolerance and survival under protein-denaturing conditions. four hsp classes have been identified in gram-positive bacteria. class i hsps comprise classical hsps that are encoded by genes within the groesl and dnak operons, and a cytoplasmic repressor hrca controls expression of these proteins. sig b controls class ii hsps, while class ii hsps are clp proteases that are typically controlled by the transcriptional repressor ctsr. class iv hsps are encoded by genes that are not controlled by hrca, sigb, or ctsr  <cit> . interestingly, our data suggest that the sav <dig> mutant strain is more sensitive to heat and cold than the wt strain. microarray data further demonstrate that the transcription of class i hsp and iii hsp genes. more specifically, hrca, ctsr, dnaj, dnak, and grpe transcript levels are higher in the sav <dig> mutant. however, expression of cold-shock genes  is not affected in the mutant. these results suggest that sav <dig> may play a role in temperature adaptation by regulating the expression of chaperone proteins. while ctsr represses the transcription of genes encoding class i and class iii hsps, however, we noted that expression of the class iii chaperone genes clpc and clpb is higher in the sav <dig> mutant strain.

the clpc operon in s. aureus comprises four genes denoted ctsr, mcsa, mcsb, and clpc. one previous study has reported that a mutation in mcsb results in hypersensitivity to heavy metal, temperature, osmotic pressure, and oxidative stresses  <cit> . clpc proteases are implicated in stress resistance, and clpc and clpb transcription increases during acid shock in s. aureus  <cit> . in this study, the sav <dig> mutant exhibited greater resistance to oxidative stress. this may be partially explained by the higher levels of clpc transcription observed in this strain.

our proteomic data further revealed that the expression of  <dig> proteins is altered at least two-fold in the sav <dig> mutant when compared with the wt strain. many of these proteins are directly or indirectly involved in important cellular processes, including the tca cycle. the tca cycle have been implicated in antibiotic resistance, and, possibly, staphylococcal virulence  <cit> . inactivation of the tca cycle delays the resolution of cutaneous ulcers in soft tissue infections of the mouse  <cit> , and disruption of citz , citc , and citb  genes prevents bacterial capsule formation  <cit> . surmann et al. analyzed survival and physiological adaptation of s. aureus after internalization by human lung epitheilial cell lines a <dig>  a number of tca cycle enzymes including citz, citc, succ and sdha increased in level upon internalization by this epithelial cell. moreover, l-lactate dehydrogenase  increased in level after internalization by a <dig> and human embryonic kidney cells hek  <dig>  indicating the supplementary utilization of fermentative enzymes under microaerobic conditions  <cit> . our proteomic results demonstrate that expression of proteins involved in tca cycle, such as odhb, citc, pdhd, and fumc, is lower in the sav <dig> mutant. furthermore, several major fermentative and anaplerotic pathway components were also decreased in the mutant, in particular lcte, malate:quinone oxidoreductase  and pyruvate kinase . these results suggest that the down-regulation of energy-providing pathways may be energetically less efficient in the mutant compared with the wild type strain, then the recovered cfu were lower in tissue of mice infected with the mutant .

furthermore, lcte catalyzes the conversion from pyruvate to lactate. the l-lactate produced by this process allows s. aureus to maintain redox homeostasis during nitrosative stress caused by activated phagocytes and is essential for virulence  <cit> . in this study, the protein level of lcte was decreased in mutant compared with wt strain. this may resulted in decrease the production of l-lactate in the mutant and cannot survive from the attack of the host, including the radial nitric oxide.

proteins involved in protein synthesis are also altered upon deletion of sav <dig> including 30s ribosomal protein s <dig>  30s ribosomal protein s <dig>  and several aminoacyl-trna synthetase. in accordance with this proteomic result, the lower mics of tetracycline, tigecycline, and gentamicin that bind 30s subunit of ribosome were observed in the sav <dig> mutant, and fully restored in com strain. these results suggest that sav <dig> may play a role in antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, tigecycline, and gentamicin, but further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying specific mechanism.

proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis are also altered upon deletion of sav <dig>  cell wall synthesis is crucial for bacterial division and growth, and it is an important target for antibiotics, including penicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. as the number of reported mrsa strains increases, vancomycin has become the first-line treatment for staphylococcal infections. however, the use of vancomycin has led to the emergence of visa strains  <cit> . typically, visa exhibits thick cell walls and reduced autolysis  <cit> . we speculate that the altered expression of cell wall metabolism-related proteins in the sav <dig> mutant results in lower mics for several antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis. moreover, the sav <dig> mutant had thinner cell walls and is more susceptible to triton x-100-induced autolysis and lysostaphin-induced cell lysis. curiously, we have observed that a susceptibility of vancomycin and teicoplanin attenuated by deletion of sav <dig> cannot be readily complemented. explanations for this phenomenon could be due to:  incomplete recovery of the cell wall thickness,  the highly complex glycopeotide resistance regulatory cross-talk in visa or  the involvement of posttranscriptional mechanisms, as we detected by comparing transciptomic and proteomic dtata, and thus will require further study.

in this study, it was observed that the lack of correlation between transcript level and identified proteins. there is a remarkable series of processes between transcription and translation, including spanning the transcription, processing and degradation of mrnas to the translation, localization, modification and programmed destruction of proteins. the abundances of protein reflect a dynamic balance among these processes  <cit> . other factors include the protein stability. the half-life of different proteins can vary from minutes to days, whereas the degradation rate of mrna would fall within a much tighter range . another factor might be of solubility of proteins in the buffers used in this study. some highly expressed genes probably encode for highly insoluble proteins that are difficult to analyze even in the presence of detergents.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to provide a functional transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the response regulator sav <dig> in s. aureus. sav <dig> plays a pronounced role in temperature adaptation, resistance to antibiotics, and virulence. in addition, it influences the expression of a large number of genes involved in the heat shock response, cell wall metabolism, energy metabolism, and response to other environmental stressors. our findings provide valuable insight into antibiotics resistance and staphylococcal pathogenicity. both may help shape future studies on antibiotic resistance trends and optimal antibacterial treatment strategies.
