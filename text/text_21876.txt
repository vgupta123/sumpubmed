BACKGROUND
salmonid alphavirus  causes pancreas disease  in atlantic salmon  and rainbow trout  characterized by necrosis of the exocrine pancreas, cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy  <cit> . it was first reported in  <dig>  <cit>  and later characterized as a member of the family togaviridae  <cit> . salmonid alphavirus has a positive sense, ssrna genome which is approximately  <dig> kb  <cit> . the genome is a capped and polyadenylated positive strand rna made of two open reading frames  that encode structural and nonstructural proteins. non-structural proteins are encoded by the 5′ end while structural proteins that form the envelope glycoproteins and the capsid are coded by the 3′ end  <cit> . our previous studies have shown that type i interferon  inhibits the replication of sav- <dig> in to-cells  <cit>  which has stimulated further interest to elucidate the transcriptomic changes induced by type i ifns in salmonids.

antiviral responses generated in response to viral infection are essential for the survival of the host. however, the assembly of an antiviral response starts at cellular level during which programmed intrinsic cell responses are initiated in a process termed ‘cell-autonomous immunity’  <cit> . chief among responses that remodel the cell’s transcriptome in response to infection is the ifn cytokine family. these cytokines induce pleiotropic biological effects by producing profiles of gene repertoires that serve as powerful signals for marshalling host defenses against microbial invasion in host cells. as pointed out by macmicking  <cit> , ifns induce the expression of a broad spectrum of genes as part of an antimicrobial program designed to combat infection in all nucleated cells. although named after their ability to interfere with virus replication in treated cells, ifns have immunodulatory, cell differentiative, anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects on cells  <cit> . in higher vertebrates, examination of recently identified ifn inducible genes  using a systems biology approach reveal a highly diverse but integrated host defense program dedicated at protecting the interior of a vertebrate cell  <cit> . while these studies have opened new insights on the role of type i ifn responses in protecting mammalian cells against viral infections, studies in teleosts fish are still in their early stages and as such little is known on protective mechanisms of different isgs on fish cells. hence, to gain a global insight on type i ifn pathway related genes expressed in fish cells, we used a rna-seq to analyze the transcriptomic changes induced by type i ifn and sav- <dig> infection in to-cells. in this study we wanted to find out whether to-cells, a continuous cell line originating from atlantic salmon  headkidney cells characterized to possess dendritic/macrophage like properties, would express the same profile of genes as those generated from mammalian phagocytic cells. by comparing the profile of isgs generated from type i ifn treated cells with sav- <dig> infected cells, we wanted to find out whether sav- <dig> infection would produce the same profile of genes comparable to those produced by type i ifn treatment in to-cells. the transcriptome presented herein shows that type i ifn induces the expression of a broad spectrum of isgs and that sav- <dig> is a potent inducer of type i ifn responses in to-cells.

methods
cell culture, virus infection and ifn treatment
to-cells originating from atlantic salmon  head kidney leukocytes characterized to possess macrophage/dendritic-like properties  <cit> , were propagated at 20°c in hmem  supplemented with l-glutamine, mem nonessential amino acids, gentamicin sulfate, and 10% fbs. the virus used to inoculate the to-cells has previously been described  <cit>  and characterized by sequencing to be salmonid alphavirus subtype  <dig>  . one batch of to-cells was treated with  <dig> ng/ml of atlantic salmon recombinant type i in triplicates and another was infected with sav- <dig> at moi  <dig> when the cells were 80% confluent. thereafter, both the type i ifn treated and sav- <dig> infected cells were incubated at 15°c in maintenance media using hmem growth media supplemented with 2% fbs. the mock group was only treated with maintenance media. after  <dig> hours when the cells were confluent, they were harvested and used for rna extraction to test for type i ifn responses. all studies in to-cells were carried out in triplicates. the recombinant type i ifn used in this study was made in our laboratory as previously described by xu et al.  <cit> .

rna isolation
total rna was isolated using the rneasy mini kit  with on-column dnase treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the concentration and the quality of rna were analyzed using a nanodrop nd <dig>  and agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer .

library construction, sequencing and data analysis for rna-seq
equal quantities of total rna from triplicates of the type i ifn treated, sav- <dig> infected and mock-to-cells were mixed to prepare the pooled rna sample for rna-seq. total rna samples were treated with dnase i to degrade any possible dna contamination. then the mrna was enriched using oligo magnetic beads. the mrna was fragmented into short fragments  by mixing with the fragmentation buffer. thereafter, the first strand of cdna was synthesized using random hexamer-primer. a buffer containing dntps, rnase h and dna polymerase i was added to synthesize the second strand. the double strand cdna was purified with magnetic beads. end reparation and 3′-end single nucleotide a  addition was then performed. finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments and the fragments were enriched by pcr amplification. during quality check , agilent  <dig> bioanaylzer and abi steponeplus real-time pcr system  were used to qualify and quantify the sample library. thereafter, library products were ready for rna-sequencing using illumina hiseqtm  <dig>  bgi-hong kong. clean reads were obtained after removal of adaptor sequences, and removal of reads having greater than 10% of unknown bases as well as removal of reads with low quality bases  greater than 50% in a read.

functional annotation and gene ontology classification
once a library of clean reads was prepared, the reads were then used for transcriptome de novo assembly using the trinity progam . thereafter, assembled unigenes were used for annotation so that they could be classified for gene functioning by searching different protein databases. to do this, we used blastx  alignment against four public protein databases; ncbi non-redundant , swiss-prot, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and cluster of orthologous groups  at e-value <  <dig> . the best alignments from the four databases were used to determine the direction of the unigenes. as for conflicting results between the different databases, the priority order nr, swissprot, kegg and cog was used. data obtained from blastx was used to extract the coding regions  from unigene sequences and translate them into peptide sequences. unigenes with no hits in blastx were analyzed using estscan to predict their cds and to decide their sequence direction. unigenes with nr annotation were further analyzed with blast2go  to obtain their gene ontology  annotations, and were then further classified according to go functions using the web gene ontology  annotation software.

identification of differentially expressed genes
the mapped read counts for each gene were normalized for rna length and for the total read number in each lane using the reads per kilobase per million  method, which facilitates comparison of the number of transcript levels generated between samples. the cutoff value for determining gene transcriptional activity was based on 95% confidence interval for all rpkm values for each gene. we used a rigorous algorithm to identify differentially expressed genes  based on comparing the exposed with unexposed group to generate the degs. in this study, degs were generated based on comparing the rpkm mapped reads from type i ifn treated cells  versus mock to-cells , designated asto-vs-ifn, while the second comparison was based on sav- <dig> infected cells  versus mock to-cells , designated as to-vs-sav <dig>  genes with a threshold of false discovery rate  < <dig>  and an absolute value log2ratio >  <dig> were considered differentially expressed. all identified degs were mapped to go annotations using the blast2go software .

validation of rna-seq data
to confirm the differential expression of genes revealed by rna-seq,  <dig> genes identified to be co-upregulated and  <dig> genes identified to be co-downregulated in to-vs-ifn and to-vs-sav <dig> were randomly chosen for qrt-pcr validation.

qrt-pcr was performed by using the quantifast sybr green rt-pcr kit  and the lightcycler  <dig> system . for each gene,  <dig> ng total rna was used as a template in a mixture of specific primers   and master mix in a final volume of  <dig> μl following manufacture’s instruction. the mixtures were first incubated for reverse transcription at 50°c for  <dig> min and subsequently for pcr initial activation at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> amplification cycles . the specificity of the pcr products from each primer pair was confirmed by melting-curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. the 2–ct method was used to calculate the fold increase in gene expression relative to the control group. all quantifications were normalized to β-actin .table  <dig>

identification of differentially expressed genes
using the trinity program, we detected a total of  <dig>  unigenes from the clean reads established above. thereafter, unigenes were screened using the criteria fdr ≤ <dig>  and |log2ratio| ≥ <dig> to identify the degs. based on this approach a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  degs were identified from the comparisons of to-vs-ifn and to-vs-sav <dig>  respectively . for the to-vs-ifn,  <dig> degs were upregulated  and  <dig> degs were downregulated  whereas the to-vs-sav <dig> produced  <dig> up-regulated degs  and  <dig>  down-regulated degs .figure  <dig> 
shows changes in the levels of differentially expressed genes  for the to-vs-ifn and to-vs-sav <dig>  only degs with a threshold of a false discovery rate  < <dig>  and absolute value log2ratio >  <dig> were considered differentially expressed.



gene ontology analysis of degs
venn diagram analysis identified  <dig> co-upregulated  and  <dig> co-downregulated  degs in to-vs-ifn and to-vs-sav <dig> while  <dig> degs were downregulated in the to-vs-sav <dig> and upregulated in the to-vs-ifn . based on gene ontology  classification,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups were identified and classified as biological process, cellular component and molecular function, for the co-upregulated degs , respectively. similarly,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups were identified and classified as biological processes, cellular component and molecular function for the co-downregulated degs, respectively . generally, unigenes linked to biological regulation, cellular process, response to stimuli, signaling, single organism processes, cell and cell part, binding and catalytic activity were highly expressed both in the co-upregulated  and co-downregulated groups . however, the major difference between the co-upregulated and co-downregulated groups is that cell-killing unigenes classified under biological processes were only expressed in the co-upregulated and not the co-downregulated unigenes while antioxidant and structural molecule activity unigenes classified under molecular functions were only expressed in the co-downregulated and not the co-upregulated degs . further, figure 5c shows go classification of genes down-regulated in response to sav- <dig>  only in which  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups were differentially expressed. the major differences between the three groups  are that the biological adhesion, extracellular matrix part, channel regulator activity and structural molecule activity functional groups were only differentially expressed in the co-downregulated unigenes  and the “to-vs-sav <dig> downregulated unigenes only”  while the nucleoid and rhythmic process functional groups were only differentially expressed in the group downregulated by sav- <dig> infection . the cell killing functional group was higher in the co-upregulated unigenes , less expressed in the group downregulated unigenes by sav- <dig> infection only  and absent in the co-downregulated unigenes .figure  <dig>

the x-axis shows the classification of unigenes in go terms while the y-axis shows the number of matched unigenes. both the co-upregulated and co-downregulated unigenes were classified into biological process , cellular components  and molecular function  . for the co-upregulated unigenes , biological process, cellular components and molecular functions accounted for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups while for the co-downregulated unigenes , biological process, cellular components and molecular functions accounted for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups. comparing the co-upregulated  and the co-downregulated  unigenes shows that the cell-killing unigenes classified under biological process  shown in asterisk  were only expressed in the co-upregulated group  while antioxidants and structural molecule activity unigenes classified under molecule function   were only expressed in the co-downregulated group. c shows go classification of unigenes that were only downregulated in response to sav- <dig> infection only of which the biological process, cellular components and molecular functions accounted for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups, respectively. although the molecular function group showed  <dig> functional groups only  <dig> were differentially expressed . the major differences among the three groups  are that biological adhesion, extracellular matrix part, channel regulator activity and structural molecule activity functional groups  were only differentially expressed in the co-downregulated unigenes  and the to-vs-sav <dig> downregulated unigenes only  while the nucleoid and rhythmic process functions  were only expressed in the group downregulated by sav- <dig> infection . the cell killing  functional group was less expressed in c, absent in b and higher in a and finally the antioxidant activity  functional group was only expressed in b.

rna-seq transcriptome profiling of type i ifn and sav- <dig> induced genes
after identifying the  <dig> co-upregulated  and  <dig> co-downregulated genes  in the to-vs-ifn and to-vs-sav <dig> together with the differentially regulated genes  of the to-vs-ifn versus to-vs-sav <dig> shown in figure 4c, we manually narrowed the scope of degs to  <dig> genes induced by type i ifns in both the to-vs-ifn and to-vs-sav <dig> groups in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptomic changes induced by type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in to-cells from the  <dig> selected genes obtained from the entire transcriptome. and as such, we identified  <dig> genes associated with type i ifn signaling pathway ,  <dig> genes belonging to different antiviral effector families ,  <dig> genes associated with adaptive immune responses  and  <dig> apoptosis associated genes  as shown below.table  <dig>

genes of type i ifn signaling pathway
the repertoire of pathogen recognition receptors , signal transducers and regulatory factors expressed in response to type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in to-cells is shown in table  <dig>  generally, the fold increase was twofold higher for the type i ifn induced genes  than the sav- <dig> induced genes . among the toll-like receptors  only tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> were upregulated while for the rig-like receptors  the fold increase of lgp <dig> was higher than rig-i and mda <dig>  four ifn regulatory factors  were up regulated of which the fold increase of irf <dig> and irf <dig> was higher than the fold increase of irf <dig> and irf <dig>  up-regulation of genes associated with signal transduction included tyrosine-protein kinase jak <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig> while the negative regulatory factors for ifn signaling upregulated included socs <dig> and socs <dig>  in addition, the ifn promoter stimulating protein  <dig>  that function as an adaptor for the downstream signaling of mda <dig> and rig-i induced responses was also upregulated.

repertoire of antiviral effector genes
the repertoire of antiviral genes upregulated in response to type i ifn treatment  and sav- <dig> infection  is shown in table  <dig>  the fold increase in genes expressed in response to type i ifn was generally twofold higher than the fold increase for genes expressed in response to sav- <dig> infection. in the trim family, four genes were upregulated namely trim  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> while in the ifit family only ifit <dig> and ifit <dig> were upregulated. among the gtpases only mx and vlig- <dig> were detected and the fold increase of vlig- <dig> was highest among all antiviral genes upregulated in response to both type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in to-cells. for the ifi family, only ifi <dig> and ifi <dig> were upregulated with the fold increase of ifi <dig> being higher than ifi <dig>  other families of antiviral genes co-upregulated included pkr, viperin, isg <dig>  vig- <dig>  csmig <dig> and mip- <dig>  only four antiviral genes were co-downregulated by type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in to-cells and these include ebpd, cxcd <dig>  cleac4e and complement protein component c7- <dig> precursor.

adaptive immune genes
the profile of co-upregulated genes associated with adaptive immune responses is shown in table  <dig>  generally, the fold increase of genes expressed in response to type i ifn treatment  was higher than the fold increase for genes expressed in response to sav- <dig>  infection except for the chemokines cxc <dig> and cxcr <dig>  il- <dig> receptor had the highest fold increase both for the type i ifn treated and sav- <dig> infected cells. as shown in table  <dig>  co-upregulated genes associated with adaptive immune responses were grouped into genes associated with activation of cytotoxic t-lymphocytes , chemokines , cytokine receptors  and humoral immune response genes . on the other hand, co-downregulated genes included il- <dig> receptor subunit β-2-like and perforin-1-like genes.

repertoire of apoptosis associated genes

discussion
de novo assembly and transcriptome analysis
rna-seq has emerged to be a valuable tool for studying transcriptomic changes that occur in response to microbial invasion in host cells although studies using rna-seq on fish are limited. to our knowledge this is the first report on the use of rna-seq to study ifn responses in fish cells. although several computer based de novo assembly tools  have been developed, only the trinity program was used for sequence assembly in this study given that several studies have shown that trinity is a powerful tool that has proved to be useful for annotating transcriptomes for different vertebrate species across taxa  <cit> . compared to other de novo transcriptome assemblers, trinity recovers more full length transcripts from rna-seq data without a reference genome with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments  <cit>  and as such trinity was considered to be a better tool for use in to-cells given the limited number of annotated genes that would serve as reference genes in salmonids. using trinity, this study demonstrates that short reads from illumina rna-seq can be assembled into protein sequences used to identify degs in fish cells that can be matched to orthologous genes found in mammals. therefore, from a comparative immunology standpoint, de novo assembly of transcriptomes can be used to compare orthologs of immune genes expressed in lower vertebrates, such as teleosts fish, with those found in higher vertebrates. for example, the degs generated in this study were matched to genes associated with ifn signaling pathway, antiviral effector functions, apoptosis associated genes and genes that activate adaptive immune responses that conform to ifn inducible genes expressed in higher vertebrates. and as such, given the limitation on annotated genes induced by type i ifn in fish, we used a comparative approach and compared genes expressed in this study with orthologous genes expressed in mammalian cells to gain a better understanding of the transcriptomic changes that occur in response to type i ifn treatment and sav3-virus infection in to-cells as discussed in detail below.

genes of the type i ifn signaling pathway
recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns  by prrs constitutes the first line of defense used by host cells in sensing microbial invasion. three prr families were upregulated namely tlrs, rlrs and nlrs in this study. among the tlrs, only tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> that are sensors of nucleic acids released in the endosomal compartments of macrophages and dcs  <cit>  were upregulated, which augments the notion that to-cells possess macrophage/dendritic cell like properties  <cit> . unlike tlrs, rlrs comprising of mda <dig>  rig-i and lgp <dig> are primary sensors of the 5′-triphosphate rna expressed by viruses in the cytoplasm  <cit>  and their upregulation in the case of sav- <dig> infection in to-cells supports the consensus view that they bind to the 5′-ppp-rna expressed by alphaviruses during replication  <cit> . while tlrs use the myd88/trif adaptor, rig-i and mda <dig> uses the ips- <dig> adaptor in their downstream signaling  <cit> , which was also upregulated in this study. further studies in mammalia show that rlr signaling converges on pathways utilized by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> resulting in the production of similar isgs  <cit> .

type i ifns bind to the ifnα receptor , which activates jak <dig> and tyk <dig> that phosphorylates stat <dig> and stat <dig>  which form heterodimers, and in association with irf <dig>  forming a trimeric complex of ifn-stimulated gene factor  <dig>  that translocates to the nucleus where it binds ifn-stimulated response elements  in the promoters of isgs genes to drive their expression  <cit> . isgs interfere with virus replication to establish a cellular antiviral state. of the four upregulated irfs, expression of irf <dig> and irf <dig> was higher than irf <dig> and irf <dig> suggesting that irf <dig> and irf <dig> played a major role in inducing type i ifn responses in to-cells. in additions, these findings suggest that irf <dig> and irf <dig> regulate the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> pathways which is in line with observations in mammalia where it has been shown that irf <dig> and irf <dig> are master regulators of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> pathways  <cit> . finally, socs <dig> and socs <dig> block jak activity and stat recruitment to the receptor thereby creating a negative signaling that prevents excess cytokine signaling that could impair the normal homeostasis and cellular function of ifn producing cells  <cit> . hence, the expression of socs <dig> and socs <dig> in this study could have been for regulating the negative feedback of ifn signaling induced in to-cells. overall, genes expressed in response to type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in this study conform to genes of the canonical type i ifn signaling pathway expressed in higher vertebrate cells.

antiviral effector genes
antiviral genes induced by type i ifn exert their effector functions by inhibiting the replication of virus at different stages of virus replication cycles. for examples, pkr inhibits cellular mrna translation which in turn prevent viral protein synthesis  <cit>  while isg <dig> achieves its antiviral function by conjugating to target proteins followed by altering their function  <cit> . viperin interferes with assembly and release of virus particles by disrupting the endoplasmic reticulum transport system that translocates viral particles to the plasma membrane  <cit> . hence, the upregulation of these genes in this study could opt for similar functions as those reported in higher vertebrates.

the trim family is primarily induced by type-i ifns expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes and fibroblasts  <cit> . recently, various trims have been identified in different fish species  <cit>  inclusive of trims  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expressed in this study. trim proteins block virus infection using different mechanisms  <cit> . for example, trim5α restricts virus entry by binding to the capsid of hiv virus to block uncoating  <cit>  while trim <dig> interferes with pre-genomic rna synthesis and protease activity of hepatitis b virus  <cit> . hence, it is likely that trim  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expressed in to-cells in this study have antiviral effects targeted at different stages of virus replication. apart from their antiviral effector functions, trims also participates in the induction of ifn synthesis. for example, trim <dig> is involved in the synthesis of ifn-β through the rig-i pathway  <cit> . thus, it is likely that trims expressed in this study are involved in the synthesis of ifns. however, there is need for detailed studies to elucidate the mechanisms used by these trims in restricting sav- <dig> replication in fish cells and to determine their role in the synthesis of type i ifns in to-cells.

the ifit family encodes genes induced by ifn treatment, virus infection or pamp recognition and they confer antiviral protection through disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation-initiation machinery  <cit> . recent revelations show that ifits can specifically recognize ssrna bearing a 5′- triphosphate group  <cit> , thereby acting as a sensor for detecting viral ssrnas. single-stranded 5′-ppp-rnas, which lack 2′-o-methylation of the 5′ cap and bear a 5′-ppp group, are specifically from viruses, which serve as a molecular signature for distinguishing self from non-self mrnas  <cit> . crystallography has shown that only single stranded 5′ppp-rnas bind to ifit <dig> and ifit <dig>  <cit> . hence, it is likely that the ifit <dig> and ifit <dig> expressed in this study binds to the 5′-ppp-rna of sav- <dig> to create an antiviral state against the virus in to-cells  <cit> .

ifn-inducible gtpases currently recognized in humans are made of four families namely the myxovirus resistant proteins , guanylate-binding proteins , immunity-related gtpase proteins  and very large inducible gtpase proteins . among these only mx and vligs were expressed in response to type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in this study. thus far, only mx has been widely studied in salmonids  <cit>  while the antiviral effector mechanisms of vligs in fish cells are yet to be elucidated.

other antiviral genes upregulated in response to type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in to-cells include ifi <dig>  ifi <dig>  csmig <dig>  mip- <dig> and vig- <dig> protein while the down regulated genes include cxcd <dig> and cleac4e. although some of these genes, such as vig- <dig>  have previously been reported in fish  <cit>  their functional mechanisms have not been established this far and there is need to elucidate the antiviral mechanisms of these genes in fish cells.

type-i ifn apoptosis associated genes
apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is a mechanism used by multicellular organisms to get rid of unwanted cells in a systematic manner  <cit> . the central feature of apoptosis, unlike necrosis, is the containment of cellular materials in membranous structures in which apoptotic particles are phagocytized without leaking the intracellular contents to the extracellular milieu  <cit> . to attain this, apoptotic cells induce signaling pathways using ifn induced genes to facilitate the removal of unwanted cells from the host. among the apoptosis associated genes expressed in this study, xaf- <dig> had the highest response to type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection followed by gelactin- <dig>  xiaf- <dig> has been shown to block the activities of xiap which is a known inhibitor of apoptosis  in human cells  <cit>  while galectin- <dig> is vital for t-cell apoptosis where it participates in killing activated or infected t-cells following an immune response  <cit> . other apoptosis associated genes expressed in this study include the apoptosis associated speck-like protein which contains a caspase recruitment domain  linked to induction of apoptosis signaling pathways  <cit>  while caspase  <dig> belong to the family of proteases that function in the initiation and execution of cell disassembly in response to apoptosis signals  <cit> . although the functional mechanisms of these genes are well studied in higher vertebrate cells, their mode of action in fish cells is yet to be elucidated.

adaptive immune response genes
type i ifns enhance antigen presentation by upregulation of mhc-i and differentiation of virus specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes thus providing an important link between innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . the repertoire of adaptive immune genes upregulated in this study conforms to genes engaged in activation of the adaptive immune response. for example, expression of mhc class ia and ib genes was accompanied by upregulation of chemokines essential for recruitment and activation of t-cells such as cxcr <dig>  which is selectively expressed in activated t-cells and not in other leukocyte subpopulations  <cit> . cxcr <dig> functions as a receptor for cxcl <dig> which plays an important role in the development and maturation of t-cells  <cit> . ccl <dig> is strongly chemotactic for naïve cd <dig> and cd8-t-cell and its expression plays an important role in the homing of naïve t-cell to mhc-i molecules expressing surface antigens on dcs  <cit> . by executing its chemotactic role, ccl <dig> initiates the activation of naïve cd <dig> and cd <dig> t-cells into effector t-helper  cells and cytotoxic t-lymphocytes   <cit> , respectively.

apart from enhancing the maturation of naïve t-cells into cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, type i ifns also play an important role in the maturation of b-cells. in the present study this notion was supported by upregulation pbef a cytokine that acts on early b-cell lineage precursor cells and regulates the early and late events leading to maturation of b-cell  <cit> . in addition, upregulation of igh locus a and b is suggestive of reorganization of the b-cell receptors induced by type i ifns during the early developmental stages. further, upregulation of il-2-receptor which regulates the activation of naïve t-helpers cells to activated th <dig> cells  <cit>  that in turn play a helper role in the maturation of naïve b-cells into immunoglobulin secreting cells  <cit>  further supports the role of type i ifns in activating the adaptive immune response  <cit> . although the functional mechanisms of these genes are well studied in higher vertebrates, their upregulation in this study suggest that they could have the same functional roles in fish cells.

induction of type i ifn responses by sav- <dig> in to-cells
data presented here suggests that sav- <dig> is a potent inducer of type i ifns in to-cells. our previous studies show that despite sav- <dig> induces a strong ifn response, the virus replicates vividly in to cells  <cit> . when cells are pre-treated with recombinant ifn,  <dig> to  <dig> hrs prior to infection, with recombinant ifnα to cells are protected against virus induced cytopathic effects and virus replication is inhibited  <cit> . these findings are consistent with observations made for other alphaviruses in mammalia showing that pretreatment with ifn inhibits alphavirus replication of in-vivo  <cit> . for sav- <dig> it is not understood why the virus can replicate in vitro under strong ifn responses. studies in chikungunya virus , another alphavirus, show that virus replication is resistant to ifn inhibition once replication is established  <cit>  and it was shown that chikv uses the nsp <dig> to suppress the antiviral effect of ifn by interfering with the jak-stat signaling pathway enabling the virus to replicate in the presence of ifn. to-cells used in this study were not pretreated with ifn prior to sav- <dig> infection and concordant with previous findings once infection was established, ifn released through downstream signal transduction had no inhibitory effects in the subsequent replication of the virus  <cit> . although we did not determine the mechanisms used by sav- <dig> to circumvent the ifn antiviral effects produced by downstream signal transduction, several studies have shown that alphaviruses use different mechanisms to block the antiviral effects of ifn once infection is established  <cit> . put together, these studies accentuate the importance of timing on the inhibitory effects of ifns on the replication of alphaviruses in infected cells. based on data presented here and our previous findings  <cit> , it can be concluded that to-cells pretreated with ifnα  before infection inhibit sav- <dig> replication while the ifn response induced from the sav- <dig> infection is not sufficient to inhibit virus replication  <cit> . thus, there is need for more detailed investigations to elucidate the mechanisms that inhibit the antiviral effects of ifn produced by downstream signal transduction after sav- <dig> infection in to-cells.

downregulation of host cellular gene expression by sav- <dig> infection in to-cells
it is interesting to note that to-cells infected by sav- <dig>  had by far a large proportion  of down-regulated genes compared to ifn treated cells  . similar observations have been made for other alphaviruses  <cit>  and several other viral families  <cit>  in which virus infection has been shown to downregulate the expression of several genes regulating cellular transcription during virus replication as a survival strategy leading to persistent infections. for example, gorchakov et al.  <cit>  have shown that replication of sindbis virus downregulates major cellular processes such as the transcription and translation of mrnas in infected cells. in their studies, they noted that inhibition of cellular mrna transcription is a critical phenomenon used by viruses to suppress the expression of cellular stress inducible genes in vertebrate cells as a survival strategy to enhance their replication. hence, this would account for the downregulation of a large proportion of genes linked to cellular, biological and molecular functions in to-cells that were only infected by sav- <dig>  and not those treated with ifn  in this study. similarly, in our previous studies we showed protein shutdown in to-cells infected with sav- <dig> only which was not seen in untreated to-cells  <cit>  which augments our current findings. put together, these studies suggest that sav- <dig> infection could be downregulating a wide range of host cellular genes to enhance its replication in to-cells using mechanisms similar to those seen for other alphaviruses in higher vertebrates  <cit> . however, there is a need for detailed investigations to underpin the exact mechanisms used by this virus to dowgnregulate the expression of host cellular genes and to demonstrate how suppression of these genes could enhance the replication of sav- <dig> in to-cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present a de novo assembly and analysis of a transcriptome of degs generated in response to type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in the macrophage/dendritic like to-cells derived from atlantic salmon headkidney leukocytes. transcriptomic changes reported here show a profile of genes belonging to the canonical type i ifn signaling pathway together with a broad spectrum of antiviral effector genes that block virus replication at different stages of the virus replication cycle. in addition, the transcriptome also shows a profile of genes associated with apoptosis as well as a repertoire of genes associated with activation of adaptive immunity. our findings also show that the profile of type i ifn pathway related genes expressed by to-cells is comparable to orthologous genes expressed by mammalian macrophages and dendritic cells. further, the study shows that sav- <dig> is a potent inducer of type i ifn responses in to-cells and that it could serve as a reliable model for studying ifn protective mechanisms in fish cells. however, it is vital to note the repertoire of type i ifn induced genes reported here only shows a profile of up- and down-regulated genes, but it does not show the exact mechanisms used by these genes to protect host cells. and as such, future studies should seek to elucidate the functional mechanisms used by these genes in protecting fish cells. in summary, this study shows a de novo assembly of a transcriptome of ifn induced genes in response to type i ifn treatment and sav- <dig> infection in to-cells that were matched to their orthologs in higher vertebrates.
