BACKGROUND
flax  has long been cultivated by man for its cellulose-rich bast fibres and seeds  <cit> . the long bast fibres are traditionally used in the textile industry for the production of linen or mixed fibre textiles, and, together with shorter xylem fibres are also used in the automobile and construction industries  <cit> . flax seeds are widely integrated into animal feeds  <cit>  and are also important in human health since they are a major source of omega- <dig> fatty acids  <cit>  and biologically active lignan  <cit> . linseed oil from seeds is equally used in the fabrication of paint, lacquer and varnish, soap, putty and polymers  <cit> .

in order to breed improved flax varieties we need to increase our fundamental knowledge of flax biology  since many important questions remain unanswered. for example, although we know that fibre quality is related to the extremely low lignin levels found in this cell type as compared to wood fibres, we do not know how lignin biosynthesis is regulated in flax fibres  <cit> . similarly, although the different biosynthetic pathways involved in fatty acid production in linseed are known, we still know relatively little about the biological mechanisms controlling linolenic acid levels in traditional flax varieties  compared to solin or linola varieties   <cit> .

the size of the flax genome  is around four times that of arabidopsis and recently different research teams have developed reverse genetics and genomic approaches to learn more about fibre and seed formation in this economicly-important species  <cit> . a cdna custom flax array system has recently been constructed and successfully used to characterize genes expression profiles in fibre-bearing stem tissues  <cit> . this platform was constructed by spotting  <dig>  anonymous cdna clones obtained from a flax stem-peel cdna library. in this paper we report the development and validation of a flax-specific high-density oligo-microarray platform using nimblegen technology. flax cdnas generated from different tissues and/or developmental stages from two different flax cultivars  were 454-sequenced and assembled into contigs. these contigs representing genes found in both oil-seed and fibre flax were used to produce a 48k array. the high quality of our array was demonstrated by the high reproducibility of different technical replications, as well as by the platform's capacity to identify differential gene expression profiles in different tissues and flax varieties.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and contig assembly
in order to produce representative high-density flax  microarrays, we extracted rna from  <dig> different samples  corresponding to different tissues and/or developmental stages from two flax cultivars  and prepared them for  <dig> sequencing. different samples were chosen for their biological interest e.g. young- , mid-stage-  and maturing-  seeds correspond to early, maximal and late stages of storage compounds synthesis. similarly, vegetative growth  and green capsule stages  are associated with fibre development.

roots
r = roots; l = leaves; sov = stem outer tissues; vegetative stage; siv = stem inner tissues; vegetative stage; sogc = stem outer tissues, green capsule stage; sigc = stem inner tissues, green capsule stage; s <dig> = seeds, 10- <dig> days after flowering ; s <dig> = seeds, 20- <dig> daf, s <dig> = seeds, 40- <dig> daf.

four  <dig> gsflx half-runs were used to sequence the  <dig> samples generating  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average length of  <dig> bp and a total of  <dig> mb . mids  were used to mix samples into the same half-runs: sov/sogc, siv/sigc, l/r, and s1/s2/s <dig>  individual sample data was then separated from the four sff  files using the roche  <dig> sff info tool.

after cleaning  <dig>  reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs, with  <dig> singlets giving a total of  <dig>  unigenes http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/index.php/urgi/species/flax/dowload-sequences. the n <dig> was  <dig> bp and  <dig>  contigs were longer than  <dig> bp.  <dig>  contigs had only  <dig> reads, > <dig>  contigs contained more than  <dig> reads and > <dig>  contigs contained more than  <dig> reads. the number of reads varied from  <dig> to more than  <dig>  potentially reflecting the relative abundance of the different transcripts. incorporation of sanger sequences available in the public domain did not alter our assembly suggesting that the shorter reads generated by  <dig> sequencing did not represent a problem for correct assembly .

functional characterization, go notation
contigs were loaded into the est2uni database and the corresponding pipeline was used to make all annotations. blast analyses were used to compare flax contig sequences to  <dig> different databases . between  <dig> % and  <dig> % contigs show significant similarity to known genes , depending upon the database used for comparison and putative arabidopsis orthologs were found for  <dig> % flax contigs. the relatively low value is probably to be expected since the reciprocal blasts necessary to identify putative orthologs was performed between the non-redundant arabidopsis gene data set and the 59k flax unigene set. go annotations could be assigned to approximately 25% of the unigenes by similarity using blast results and goa and tair gene cross-referenced files.  <dig>  sequences  could be assigned molecular functions ,  <dig>  sequences  could be assigned biological processes  and  <dig>  sequences  sequences could be assigned cellular components .

microarray design
analyses of the 59k unigene set allowed for several different probe design possibilities. after examination, we chose a design based upon 48k contigs as being the most representative of the 59k unigene set. microarrays were designed according to the roche/nimblegen protocol based on 3' end cdna synthesis and both annotated and non-annotated contigs were used. the final design contained  <dig> non-overlapping oligos  per contig allowing for both qualitative and quantitative hybridization. this design is available at the geo web site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/ under the platform number gpl <dig> 

parameters of microarray performance
the nimblegen array system is based upon the hybridization of a single labeled sample , followed by one-channel detection. the intensity of the hybridization signal is then used to determine target concentration. in order to check the technical quality of each probe in our flax nimblegen arrays, we performed  <dig> independent hybridizations on nine samples representing different tissues and/or different developmental stages  with two technical repetitions. in order to avoid any potential bias due to biological variability the hybridizations were performed on the same rna samples  used for  <dig> sequencing. technical quality was determined by evaluating the following parameters: hybridization quality, precision and accuracy.

hybridization quality
our results  showed that all probes present on the array were capable of hybridizing successfully  when tested on the different samples. the sensitivity of the array was demonstrated by the wide signal dynamic range obtained . the experimental metrics report  was used as recommended by roche/nimblegen to generate summary statistics that can be used to identify any potential problems during hybridization. most of these metrics , number of empty features on the array, mean empty, the number of random control features present on the array, mean random) assume probe randomization on the array surface. thus, deviation from uniformity  across the array could suggest potential artifacts during hybridization. metric values  for all  <dig> samples analyzed were within the recommended value range indicating that hybridization quality was satisfactory.

precision
a crucial aspect of all microarray experiments is good system reproducibility enabling direct and reliable comparisons between different experiments. precision describes how accurately the hybridization signal intensity can be reproduced and is usually reported as a correlation coefficient, standard deviation or average replicate error between duplicated experiments using the same rna sample  <cit> . raw expression data on the  <dig>  flax hybridization experiments were normalized and pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for the data sets of hybridization signal intensities. high correlation coefficients were obtained in all cases and the results obtained for the flax leaf sample are shown in figure  <dig>  these results  indicate an almost perfect correlation between different technical experiments underlining the extremely high precision level for our flax oligo-array platform. such reproducibility is similar to that obtained with affymetrix genechips  <cit>  and is probably also due to probe redundancy. previous work has shown that the use of multiple independent oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to different regions of the same rna improves signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic range of detection, as well as minimizing cross-hybridization effects  <cit> .

accuracy
accuracy describes how close to a true value a measurement lies. it can be estimated in experiments where a number of realistic targets are spiked at known concentrations into relevant rna populations, or from comparisons with validation experiments, or by correlation of two different methods  <cit> .

gene-specific quantitative qrt-pcr was used for the cross-validation of platform performance and as an assessment of microarray accuracy. we selected  <dig> genes reflecting up-regulated , down-regulated  or equally-expressed genes  in leaf  samples compared with stem  samples. selected genes also covered a wide range of signal intensity . table  <dig> shows the expression levels of the same target genes detected by qrt-pcr and microarray analyses. expression level was calculated as log2ratio of mean signal intensity across three technical replicates between l and sigc samples. a statistically significant correlation  between qrt-pcr and microarray results was obtained for all tested genes  indicating high concordance between these  <dig> data sets. the observation that the fold-change values in gene expression are lower for the microarray data as compared to the qrt-pcr data is most likely due to data compression resulting from limited dynamic range or signal saturation  <cit> . these data indicate that our oligo-array platform is able to accurately predict the direction of change of gene expression level  between subsets of interest.

gene expression was calculated as log2ratio of l vs sigc samples, using mean signal intensity across three technical replicates of each sample. values > <dig> indicate up-regulation, and values <- <dig> indicate down-regulation.

differential gene expression detection
in order to see whether our flax microarray platform was able to generate biologically-useful information, we analyzed its capacity to detect specific gene expression profiles associated with different tissues, different developmental stages, and different genotypes. firstly, we used principal component analysis  to compare expression profiles in the  <dig> different samples previously hybridized. secondly, we compared the expression of  <dig> genes known to be involved in the process of secondary cell wall biosynthesis and wood formation. thirdly, we directly compared expression profiles between inner and outer stem tissues at two developmental stages. finally, we compared gene expression profiles in  <dig> supplementary flax varieties that show differences in fibre quality and disease resistance.

differential gene expression in flax tissues and developmental stages
the results of principal component analysis  of microarray data and representative k-means profiles of tissue-/stage-specific gene expressions are shown in figure  <dig>  three major regions of dispersion are found: a) genes specifically expressed in roots , b) genes expressed specifically in stems and leaves  and c) genes specifically expressed in seeds . genes similarly expressed in all tissues are clustered in the middle of the figure.

j-express generated a list of  <dig>  specifically expressed genes of which  <dig> were root-specific genes,  <dig> leaf-specific genes,  <dig> shoot-specific genes and  <dig> seed-specific genes. differential expression profiles of these genes were verified by a sam test with a fdr less than 5%. annotated genes in these different groups were then classified into different go biological processes and the percentages of tissue-specific gene expressions were calculated for each process .

overall, these results are in general agreement with the known physiological processes of the different organs/tissues thereby suggesting that our platform is capable of generating biologically-useful gene-expression data. for example, leaves are well known to be the plant's main photosynthetic organs and leaf structure is closely associated with its photosynthetic function and chloroplast biogenesis  <cit> . the observation that the go process 'photosynthesis' is entirely composed of genes specifically expressed in the leaves , as are the go processes 'cellular component biogenesis', and 'protein modification process' is in agreement with the biological structure and role of this organ. in root tissues the go processes 'cell growth' and 'response to stress' were the most represented functions in agreement with the biological activities of this organ  <cit> . as in other plant species, the flax stem is characterized by the differentiation of different specialized tissues  <cit>  and the majority stem-specific gene expression in the development go process is in keeping with the biological activity of this organ. finally, cell-cycle and cellular homeostasis go processes were associated with embryo-specific gene expressions characteristic of embryogenesis  <cit> .

similar analyses  of the relationship between different tissue-specific genes and metabolisms also suggest that our platform is capable of generating biologically-relevant information. of interest are the relatively high percentages of genes associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms in seeds since direct quantitative measurements  <cit>  have shown that sucrose and lipids represent the largest metabolite pools in flax seeds. similarly, secondary metabolism represents the major metabolism in flax stems and is most likely associated with the lignification of xylem secondary cell walls  <cit> .

differential gene expression in a targeted process
we compared the expression of four genes known to be involved in the process of secondary cell wall biosynthesis and wood formation characteristic of inner stem tissues  <cit> . expression levels of cellulose synthase , phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , transcinnamate 4-hydroxylase , and caffeoyl-coa 3-o-methyltransferase  were calculated as log2ratio of the signal intensity in each tissue vs. the average of signal intensity across all analyzed tissues . as expected, the great majority of these genes were more highly expressed in inner tissues . these observations confirm that the flax oligo-array platform is able to accurately discriminate gene expression profiles in different tissues.

differential gene expression between flax inner and outer stem tissues
in order to verify that our oligo-array platform could be used in future studies to provide biologically-relevant information about cell wall formation and fibre development in flax, we compared expression profiles between the heavily lignified inner stem tissues and the outer stem tissues enriched in weakly-lignified bast fibres at two different developmental stages.

the results  showed that in vegetative stage samples,  <dig> genes were over-expressed in inner stem tissues as compared to outer stem tissues  > 2), and  <dig> genes were over-expressed in outer stem tissues as compared to inner stem tissues. examination of the  <dig> genes over-expressed in the inner stem tissues showed that  <dig> genes  were potentially associated with cell wall formation and xylem identity. of these differentially-expressed cell wall genes, 50%  were associated with lignification and included both monolignol biosynthetic genes and laccases involved in the oxidative polymerisation of this phenolic polymer. such an observation is in agreement with the fact that flax inner stem tissues, mainly composed of xylem, are much more heavily lignified than the outer tissues containing cellulose-rich bast fibes  <cit> . other cell-wall related genes coded for proteins involved in polysaccharide cell wall polymer synthesis and remodelling. in addition,  <dig> genes  coding for fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins  were also over-expressed in inner tissues as compared to outer tissues. interestingly, fla genes are highly expressed in flax outer stem tissues, as well as in poplar tension wood where they have been hypothesized to be involved in the formation of cellulose-rich gelatinous fibres   <cit> . our observation  that  <dig> other fla genes  are more highly expressed in flax outer stem tissues when compared to inner stem tissues could suggest that these proteins play a role in secondary cell wall formation in both flax inner and outer stem tissues.

similar analyses  of the  <dig> genes over-expressed in flax outer stem tissues when compared to inner stem tissues revealed that only  <dig> genes  were associated with cell wall formation. in contrast,  <dig> genes were potentially associated with lipid and wax metabolism,  <dig> genes were related to photosynthesis and  <dig> genes were stress-related. these differences reflect the different physiological status of flax inner and outer stem tissues. for example, the high percentage of 'cell-wall-related' transcripts in inner stem tissues is associated with secondary xylem formation while the relative abundance of photosynthesis-related transcripts reflects the fact that outer stem tissues are green. nevertheless, it is interesting to note that  <dig> genes  over-expressed in outer stem tissues corresponded to lipid transfer proteins . ltps have been previously associated with diverse aspects of cell wall development and formation and have also been shown to be more highly expressed in flax outer stem tissues  <cit> . such an observation could suggest that such proteins might be associated with fibre maturation in flax. as indicated above,  <dig> flas  were also over-expressed in outer stem tissues as compared to inner stem tissues.

comparison  of inner and outer stem tissue expression profiles  at the green capsule stage revealed a very similar differential expression pattern to that observed for the vegetative stage suggesting that little modification/evolution of inner and outer stem transcriptomes occurs between these two developmental stages. this was confirmed by the observation that only  <dig> cell-wall related genes  were up-regulated in inner stem tissues at the vegetative stage as compared to the green capsule stage, and no cell-wall related genes were up-regulated in inner stem tissues at the green capsule stage as compared to vegetative inner stem tissues. in outer stem tissues,  <dig> cell wall genes  were more highly expressed at the vegetative stage as compared to the green capsule stage. two of these genes  code for xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydroalses , one gene  codes for a secondary cell wall associated glycosyltransferase and one gene for a fla. since these  <dig> genes are implicated in cell wall remodelling and assembly events, such an observation could suggest that cell wall formation in outer stem tissues is more active at the vegetative stage as compared to the green capsule stage. no cell wall genes were more highly expressed at the green capsule stage as compared to the vegetative stage.

the vegetative stage  corresponds to the fast-growth stage associated with the increase in plant height and fibre lengthening above the snap point, as well as fibre cell wall thickening below the snap point  <cit> . at the green capsule stage  fibres have stopped elongating and further fibre development is restricted to continued fibre cell wall thickening  <cit> . our results would suggest that continued fibre thickening  is associated with continued expression of cell wall related genes.

altogether these analyses confirm that our oligo-array platform represents a powerful tool for investigating cell wall development and fibre formation in flax stems. our arrays should also prove extremely useful for investigating other interesting biological processes in flax such as oil and seed formation, disease resistance and tolerance to abiotic stress.

differential gene expression in contrasting flax genotypes
we used our platform to see whether the flax microarrays were able to detect differentially-expressed genes between  <dig> contrasting flax genotypes - drakkar and belinka. drakkar produces better quality fibres than the variety belinka, as well as being more resistant to the fungal pathogen fusarium http://www.lin-itl.com <cit> . rna was isolated at the green capsule stage from outer stem tissues of field-grown flax plants and  <dig> biological and  <dig> technical repetitions were used for each variety. following hybridization, the log2ratio was calculated as the intensity signal of each gene in the drakkar genotype vs. belinka. the pearson's correlation was >  <dig>  for technical repetitions and >  <dig>  for biological repetitions for both belinka and drakkar. a total of  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were found. only  <dig> genes were annotated or associated with a known biological function. .

since the  <dig> genotypes show differences in fibre quality and pathogen resistance, we focused our attention on those differentially-expressed genes associated with cell wall biosynthesis and response to biotic stimuli. fibre quality in flax is associated with both the structure of the cellulose-rich secondary cell wall and the architecture  of individual fibres  <cit> . the observation  that  <dig> cell-wall related genes were up-regulated in drakkar, as compared to belinka is therefore extremely interesting. these genes include  <dig> gene  involved in cellulose biosynthesis,  <dig> genes  involved in secondary cell wall hemicellulose synthesis,  <dig> genes , involved in phenylpropanoid/lignin biosynthesis,  <dig> gene  involved in cell wall expansion,  <dig> gene  involved in sucrose partitioning  <cit> , and  <dig> gene  that has previously been associated with both flax fibre formation  <cit>  and g-fibre formation in tree reaction wood  <cit> . only  <dig> cell wall related gene  associated with wall remodeling events was up-regulated in belinka as compared with drakkar. the up-regulation of these genes could suggest that cell wall biosynthesis is more dynamic in the drakkar variety and is possibly related to the different fibre quality characteristic of this variety. however, further functional validation is obviously necessary before confirming such hypotheses.

a total of  <dig> genes involved in biotic stress response were up-regulated in drakkar as compared with belinka, while  <dig> genes were up-regulated in belinka as compared with drakkar . interestingly,  <dig> of the most up-regulated genes  in drakkar code for cysteine proteases known to play an important role in programmed cell death  associated with the hypersensitive response   <cit> . two other highly up-regulated genes  encode germin-like proteins potentially associated with ros production and cell-wall cross-linking in defense  <cit> . one up-regulated gene  has been previously shown to be involved in flax resistance to rust   <cit> . in belinka, the most highly up-regulated gene  as compared to drakkar correspond to a hypersensitive-induced response protein.

overall, these results would suggest that our flax microarray platform is capable of detecting biologically-relevant differential gene expression between contrasted flax varieties. as such, our microarrays represent a powerful tool for identifying candidate genes potentially associated with quality-related polymorphism and therefore represent a valuable contribution to molecular-based plant improvement programs.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a powerful and robust high-density oligo-microarray platform for transcriptomics in flax. high correlations were consistently obtained with technical repetitions on a wide range of different samples and results were cross-validated using an independent method . the platform is capable of high discrimination and can provide biologically-useful information on specific gene expression profiles of different flax tissues, and developmental stages. initial studies also enabled the identification of specifically-expressed cell wall- and defence-related genes in  <dig> different flax varieties showing contrasting fibre quality and resistance towards a fungal pathogen. these results indicate that our microarray platform can make a useful contribution towards understanding the genetic basis of plant quality in flax.
