BACKGROUND
clostridium perfringens, an anaerobic gram-positive bacterium known to be a common pathogen in humans, in domestic animals and in wildlife, is the primary cause of clostridial enteric disease in domestic animals. the complete genome sequence of c. perfringens has been published previously  <cit> . c. perfringens has  <dig> rrna operons whose heterogeneity was investigated by shimizu et al.  <cit> . they found  <dig> polymorphic sites among the 16s rrna genes. a common feature of c. perfringens is the large number of exotoxins produced;  <dig> different exotoxins have been described in the literature  <cit> . in addition, c. perfringens produces an enterotoxin, cpe  <cit> .

clostridium perfringens is subdivided into five toxinotypes  based on the production of the four major exotoxins . the major toxins together with the enterotoxin and the beta <dig> toxin  <cit> , play an important role in several serious diseases  <cit> . cpe causes food-borne disease in humans, canine enteritis and porcine enteritis. beta <dig> toxin, recently described  <cit> , has been associated with enteric diseases in domestic animals, especially piglets  <cit>  and horses  <cit> . however, two recently published studies, by jost et al.  <cit>  and vilei et al.  <cit> , demonstrated that beta <dig> toxin, encoded by cpb <dig>  was expressed by most porcine c. perfringens isolates, but seldom by isolates of non-porcine origin. the results of those studies indicate that beta <dig> toxin does not cause enteritis in animal species other than pigs. vilei et al.  <cit>  reported that gentamicin and streptomycin induced expression of an atypical cpb <dig> gene in a non-porcine isolate. in a recent publication by waters et al.  <cit> , it was reported that cpb <dig> of c. perfringens from horses was transcriptionally active and that the levels of cpb <dig> mrna were 35-fold lower than a high beta <dig> toxin producing pig isolate. isolates originating from humans with gastrointestinal diseases carrying both cpb <dig> and cpe have recently been described  <cit> .

the epidemiological relationship between c. perfringens isolates has previously been investigated primarily by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and in most of these studies a majority of isolates from food poisoning outbreaks were examined  <cit> . c. perfringens isolates originating from poultry have also been investigated previously by pfge  <cit> . the general conclusions drawn from the previously published articles, concerning both food poisoning outbreaks and animals, is that isolates from the same outbreak have very similar patterns while the genetic diversity is high in non-outbreak isolates and isolates selected randomly  <cit> . the problem of dna degradation of certain isolates due to endogenous bacterial nucleases, which are rather common among clostridial isolates, has been discussed elsewhere  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to compare the genetic relationships of c. perfringens type a from eight different sources by pfge. a further aim was to investigate the distribution of the cpb <dig> and cpe genes. the cpb <dig> gene from all cpb2-positive isolates was also partially sequenced. in this study a generally wide genetic diversity of c. perfringens isolates from eight different sources was found. furthermore, pfge clearly distinguished between unrelated isolates of c.perfringens and supported a clonal relationship between related isolates. sequence analysis of the partially sequenced cpb <dig> gene revealed two genetically different populations of the gene.

RESULTS
pcr
multiplex pcr detected only the alpha-toxin gene  and all isolates were therefore classified as c. perfringens type a. altogether  <dig> isolates carried the cpb <dig> gene and  <dig> carried the cpe gene . the cpb <dig> gene was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> groups studied: pigs , horses , sheep , food poisoning outbreaks , sludge  and poultry . the cpb <dig> gene was not detected in any of the isolates from roedeer or wild birds. the cpe gene was found in all isolates originating from food poisoning outbreaks and in one isolate each from horse and roedeer. both cpb <dig> and cpe were found in three isolates originating from outbreaks of food poisoning.

pfge
of the  <dig> isolates of c. perfringens examined in this study,  <dig> were successfully characterized by pfge after genomic dna digestion with smai . the smai pfge patterns of some of these isolates are shown in figure  <dig>  the genetic relatedness of the isolates ranged from  <dig> to 100% and  <dig> distinct pfge profiles were observed. cluster analysis of pfge data showed no apparent relationship between the source of the isolate and its pfge profile. however, the isolates originating from food poisoning outbreak formed distinct clusters in the dendrogram . altogether,  <dig> pfge profiles with indistinguishable patterns were found. most of the isolates having pfge profiles with indistinguishable patterns were from the same outbreak of disease. all of the eight food isolates clustering with indistinguishable patterns originated from the same outbreak of food poisoning. the poultry and porcine isolates clustering with indistinguishable patterns were also isolated from the same outbreaks. two of the pfge profiles with indistinguishable patterns contained isolates with no obvious epidemiological correlation. of the  <dig> cpb2-positive isolates,  <dig> were successfully characterized by pfge. the smai pfge patterns of these isolates are shown in figure  <dig>  the overall genetic relatedness of the cpb2-positive isolates was 63%. all the  <dig> isolates originating from pigs cluster together with a genetic relatedness of 72%. this cluster was subdivided into four subclusters with 100% genetic relatedness in each cluster.

sequence data analysis
in the phylogenetic tree  two main groups of the partially sequenced cpb <dig> gene  were observed, i and ii, each subdivided to three subclusters, a, b, c. a total of six groups could be identified . groups i and ii are mutually related, with a sequence similarity of  <dig> %. all isolates in our study were found in group i. the sequence similarities within this group varied between  <dig> % and 100%. our cpb <dig> sequences from porcine  and from non-porcine  cluster with the cpb <dig> sequences deposited by vilei et al  <cit> . the three cpb <dig> sequences from food and the horse isolate an 5036/ <dig> was found in group ic. most of the isolates in group ii were isolated in the usa, while most of those in group i were isolated in europe.

sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed a very high similarity among the  <dig> isolates analysed. as shown in table  <dig>  altogether  <dig> polymorphic sites were detected in the 16s rrna region between nucleotide no.  <dig> and  <dig> . seven of the polymorphisms found in our isolates were also found in c. perfringens strain  <dig>  <cit> . at position  <dig> of the 16s rrna genes, one nucleotide difference was observed; at this position, isolates from food poisoning outbreaks  had a t, whereas all others had a c. this was the only nucleotide difference involving all operons that was observed in the sequenced isolates.

discussion
prevalence of the cpb <dig> and cpe genes
the high prevalence of the cpb <dig> gene in isolates from pigs and horses is consistent with other studies reporting a high prevalence of cpb <dig> in pigs and horses suffering from gastrointestinal diseases  <cit> . the distribution of cpe in isolates of animal origin is low, which also tallies with data from other studies  <cit> . isolates from food poisoning outbreaks typically carry a chromosomal cpe gene  <cit> ; in this study three of these isolates also carried the cpb <dig> gene. in this study three of the isolates from food poisoning outbreaks also carried the cpb <dig> gene. isolates originating from humans with gastrointestinal diseases, carrying both cpb <dig> and cpe, have been described recently  <cit> .

pfge analysis
the aim of this study was to elucidate the general genetic diversity of c. perfringens type a isolated from a variety of sources in sweden and norway. in the present study, any band difference between two pfge types was considered sufficient to distinguish between two different pfge types. the results obtained by pfge reveal a wide genetic diversity and no definite relationship between the source of the isolate and the positions in the dendrogram can be established.

the wide genetic diversity revealed in this study was not unexpected, because of the wide diversity of the isolates analysed. previous studies on c. perfringens by pfge have shown that isolates from the same food poisoning outbreak have a very similar pattern  <cit>  and that c. perfringens isolated from retail food showed a high genetic variation  <cit> . this has also been observed in poultry where isolates from diseased birds showed a similar pattern, whereas the genetic diversity was considerable in isolates from healthy birds  <cit> . those observations are consistent with our results, where we can see that pfge profiles with indistinguishable patterns in almost all cases contain isolates having a known epidemiological connection. comparison of the pfge patterns of the cpb2-positive isolates revealed a clonal relationship among the porcine isolates , which cluster together in the dendrogram . however, no clonal relationship could be established for isolates belonging to groups ib and ic. the cpb <dig> gene is known to be located on several low copy number plasmids  <cit> . the genetic diversity of cpb2-positive isolates is therefore, not surprising, as pfge mainly reflects the chromosomal diversity.

in this study 13% of the isolates were non-typable due to dna degradation. this problem has been reported previously  <cit> . it is a disadvantage when pfge is used as a subtyping method for clostridial species. however, problems with dna degradation have not been reported previously when analysing poultry isolates by pfge  <cit> . as in this study none of the isolates from poultry, horses or pigs were found degraded, pfge is a very suitable method for epidemiological investigation of enteric diseases caused by c. perfringens. the 16s rrna gene was sequenced for three of the isolates that were found degraded. neither dna degradation nor the generally wide genetic diversity was reflected in the 16s rrna sequences, which were very similar. the use of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype braenderup, , digested with xbai as a size marker made it easier to normalize tiff images, than by using a commercially available weight marker, thanks to stable levels of dna in the prepared plugs  <cit> .

in our opinion, pfge is a reliable and robust method that can be used in combination with epidemiological data to establish c.perfringens as the etiological agent whether in food-borne outbreaks or in outbreaks of enteric disease in domestic animals.

sequence analysis of the cpb <dig> gene
sequence analysis of the cpb <dig> gene  indicated the existence of two evolutionary differing populations based on  <dig> nucleotide positions, corresponding to positions  <dig> to  <dig> in the consensus cpb <dig> sequence. a relatively high sequence difference of  <dig> % showed that cpb <dig> evolved into two different variants . the isolates sequenced in this study all belonged to group i and were divided into three sub-clusters: porcine isolates , animal isolates of non-porcine origin , and isolates from food poisoning outbreaks . one of the horse isolates an 5036/ <dig> clustered together with the food isolates. most of the group i cpb2-positive isolates were of european origin  <cit> , while most cpb2-positive isolates from group ii had an american origin  <cit> . however, isolates containing cpb <dig> isolated from humans with a gastrointestinal disease were distributed in both groups , irrespective of origin  <cit> . groups i and ii both contained isolates capable of expressing cpb <dig> and also isolates that express non-detectable levels of beta <dig> toxin  <cit> . jost et al.  <cit>  identified a cpb <dig> gene that was present in most non-porcine isolates. the cpb <dig> sequences deposited by jost et al.  <cit>  were all affiliated to group ii . isolates from european animals carrying the cpb <dig> gene were all affiliated to group i. it is interesting that none of the cpb2-positive isolates from animals in europe carried the cpb <dig> gene, which are found in group ii.

sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene
the reason for sequencing the 16s rrna gene was to ascertain whether the diversity found by pfge analysis was reflected in the 16s rrna gene. isolates that were degraded and those found in different clusters in the pfge dendrogram showed a very high sequence similarity. however, we found  <dig> positions with polymorphisms among our investigated isolates . these polymorphisms are caused by the fact that c. perfringens carries  <dig> rrna operons and sequence differences exist between them. some of these polymorphisms were isolate specific. seven of those found by us were also found by shimizu et al.  <cit>  who analysed all the  <dig> rrna operons of c. perfringens strain  <dig>  the polymorphisms found in the c. perfringens 16s rrna genes reflect certain diversity. in a few other bacterial species polymorphisms have been used for subtyping  <cit> , but due to the  <dig> rrna operons in c. perfringens, it is more difficult to use the polymorphism pattern for subtyping.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study a wide genetic diversity of c. perfringens was found when isolates from eight different sources were analysed by pfge. degradation of dna was observed in 13% of the isolates investigated. the considerable diversity found by pfge was not reflected in the 16s rrna sequences, which were very similar. as expected, c. perfringens isolates from the same outbreak seemed to be similar genetically, while isolates with no obvious epidemiological connection differed more noticeably. the groups with the highest genetic relatedness were isolates from food-borne outbreaks and pig isolates carrying the cpb <dig> gene. isolates from the other sources were more widely dispersed in the dendrogram. two genetically differing populations of the partially sequenced cpb <dig> gene were found by sequence analysis. furthermore, isolates causing enteric diseases in humans and other animals seem not to have a strong genetic relatedness, based on pfge analysis. we conclude that pfge is a reliable and robust method for genotyping of c. perfringens isolates.
