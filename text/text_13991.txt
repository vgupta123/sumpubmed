BACKGROUND
the occurrence of a large outbreak involving enteroaggregative hemorrhagic e. coli  o104:h <dig> infections in europe and north america in  <dig> with prior reporting of similar strains in patients with severe infections and hemolytic uremic syndrome  in asia, norway, and the republic of georgia raises questions about the origin, evolution, genetic diversity, and virulence of these pathogens  <cit> . the german outbreak o104:h <dig> strain 2011-c- <dig> had the characteristics of an enteroaggregative e. coli ; however, it carried the gene that encodes shiga toxin 2a , and thus can also be classified as a shiga toxin-producing e. coli . bielaszewska et al.  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> isolates from this outbreak and found that they belonged to st   <dig>  similar to the husec <dig> strain isolated from a patient with hus in germany in  <dig>  moreover, the outbreak strains possessed a plasmid carrying ctx-m- <dig>  encoding an extended-spectrum-β-lactamase, which is absent in husec <dig>  e. coli o104:h <dig> strains and o <dig> strains with other h-types showed genetic and phenotypic differences, including the presence of specific virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, the types of shiga toxin genes, and their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles  <cit> .

some of the most common flagellar h antigens associated with stec strains include h¯, h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  <cit> . shiga toxin-producing strains belonging to serogroup o <dig> with the h <dig> or h <dig> flagellar antigens could be considered as more pathogenic  <cit> . according to the european food safety authority, serogroup o <dig> has been reported from studies related to surveillance of animals and food by the eu member states  <cit> . e. coli o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> were isolated from young cattle in austria in  <dig>  o104:h <dig> from sheep and wild boar  in spain, o104:h <dig> from sheep in india, from young cattle in argentina, and from unspecified meat and sheep meat in new zealand  <cit> . to date, other o <dig> serotypes attributed to human cases have been identified as o104:h <dig>  <cit> , o104:h <dig>  <cit> , and o104:h¯  <cit> . in the u.s., there was an outbreak in montana in  <dig> caused by milk contaminated with stec o104:h <dig>  <cit> .

differences in virulence and antibiotic resistance genes linked to disease severity and hus among various o <dig> serotype strains, including o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> have been observed  <cit> . the differential phenotypic properties of o <dig> strains with h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> antigens on selective media, such as brilliance esbl , chromagar stec, and chromagar o <dig> were also reported  <cit> . however, there is little information regarding the genetic basis of virulence of non-o104:h <dig> pathogens and how they might have emerged or were transmitted. therefore, these serotypes should be fully investigated at the genomic level to identify genes important for virulence and for growth and survival in food. moreover, besides eaec-stec o104:h <dig>  stec o104:h <dig>  and stec o104:h <dig>  several stx-negative o104:h <dig> strains have been isolated from human patients in central africa  <cit>  at different locations and at different times. thus far, humans are considered as the only natural reservoir of eaec strains  <cit> , and the search for the source of the o104:h <dig> outbreak strain revealed that there was no animal reservoir for eaec/ehec/stec o104:h <dig> isolates  <cit> . in contrast, stec o104:h <dig> and stec o104:h <dig> are reported to be associated with contaminated milk  <cit> , feces of cattle, and/or from food of bovine origin  <cit> . facilitated by next generation sequencing  technologies, the identification of mobile genetic elements, including plasmids, transposons, prophages, genomic islands, and chromosomal pathogenicity islands  encoding virulence- and antibiotic resistance- associated genes, has provided insight into the genomic differences among environmental, animal, and clinical strains isolated from geographically dispersed areas. unlike other stec that cause serious human illness, stec o <dig> strains lack the eae gene; however they can attach to intestinal cells. the eahec o104:h <dig> outbreak strain 2011c- <dig> also lacked eae; however, this strain possessed a plasmid  that encodes for adherence fimbriae  <cit> . studies found that not all o <dig> serotypes possess aggr, which encodes a regulator of virulence plasmid and chromosomal genes including aggregative adherence fimbriae and aaia-p , a characteristic of eaec. eahec o104:h <dig> colonizes the human bowel through aggregative adherence fimbriae encoded by the eaec plasmid . in the european o104:h <dig> outbreak strains, the intimin  function was substituted by the plasmid-encoded aggregative adherence fimbrial colonization mechanism, and once attached, the cells were able to produce and deliver shiga toxin 2a, resulting in severe illness and hus. recently, beutin et al.  <cit>  studied the possible uptake of the chromosome-encoded stx2-phage p <dig>  by eaec strains of different serotypes. in this study, the authors concluded that the stx2-phage p <dig> had a restricted host range, and its spread was dose-sensitive. one of the bovine-specific phages  was found to be capable of lysogenizing a stx-negative eaec o104:h <dig> strain and converted it into an eaec-stec producing stx2a  <cit> .

previously published sequence data on o104:h <dig> isolates revealed variations in gene content among strains from different hosts and geographical sources  <cit> . differences were observed in virulence- and resistance- associated genes among various h-serotypes of o <dig> strains. a better understanding of the genomic differences among strains belonging to different o104:h serotypes will help to reveal the basis for their pathogenicity and will provide information to understand how they evolved. the aim of this study was to sequence the genomes of the o104:h <dig> milk outbreak strain and a stec o104:h <dig> cattle isolate, which had not been associated with human illness, and perform comparative analyses with the genomes of several e. coli o104:h <dig> strains isolated from different geographical locations. the resultant sequence analysis revealed notable differences among o <dig> strains belonging to h-serotypes h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  including the presence of different plasmids and other mobile genetic elements.

RESULTS
general genomic features of o104:h <dig> and o104:h7
the genomes of stec o104:h <dig> strain 94– <dig> that caused an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis in montana in  <dig> linked to contaminated milk and strain o104:h <dig> rm <dig>  isolated from cattle feces, were sequenced. the genome size of o104:h <dig> strain 94– <dig> was  <dig> ,583 bp, while that of o104:h <dig> rm <dig> was  <dig> ,630 bp. o104:h <dig> rm <dig> carried  <dig> plasmids,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  bp in size; on the other hand, o104:h <dig> strain 94– <dig> had only one large  <dig> -bp plasmid. the g + c content for strains o104:h <dig> rm <dig> and o104:h <dig> 94– <dig> were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, similar to that of other e. coli o <dig> strains. information on all strains analyzed in this study, including genome size, gc content, and number of plasmids, is shown in .

comparison at the genomic level
in order to gain insight on the genomic differences among environmental, animal, and clinical strains isolated from geographically dispersed areas, the whole genome sequence of various eaec/stec o <dig> strains were analyzed. whole-genome comparison showed that these  <dig> o <dig> strains shared a conserved core chromosomal backbone but contained various mobile genomic elements reflected in the differences in their genome sizes. details will be further discussed in the next three sections.

a comparison of seven o <dig> genomes, as visualized by the program mauve  <cit> , including three o104:h <dig> strains isolated during an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis in montana in  <dig>  <cit> , is shown in figure  <dig>  homologous regions that are conserved are shown in the same colors in figure 1; gaps within a unique genomic region are in white. in this figure, considerable conservation in the  <dig> genomes is revealed, although some serotype-specific regions were observed. for example, all three o104:h <dig> isolates possesed  <dig> prominent regions either completely missing , or partially missing  in o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> strains. region # <dig>  was present in all analyzed o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> strains, but missing in the sequenced o104:h <dig> strain. other regions of significant genomic dissimilarity in o104:h <dig> include region # <dig> , # <dig> , and # <dig> .figure  <dig>

whole genome phylogenetic comparisons among various o <dig> h type strains and other lee-negative stec
in this study, we first inferred a whole-genome phylogeny of strains based on an alignment  based on an alignment of whole-genome contigs or complete full genome sequence mapped onto the complete closed genome sequence of the o104:h <dig> outbreak strain 2009el- <dig>  as the reference. a phylogenetic tree of o <dig> strains of different h-types from different sources revealed overall similar clustering of strains belonging to the h <dig> type, and that h <dig> and h <dig> had a closer relationship to each other than to o104:h <dig> . the similarity of the profiles of the mobile genetic elements and the phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> might share a similar evolutionary path since they are more closely related to each other than to o104:h <dig> strains. phylogenetic comparisons among various lee-negative stec serotypes and different o <dig> strains showed that lee-negative stec serotypes o91:h <dig> and o113:h <dig> were genetically closer to o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> than to o104:h <dig> . our phylogenetic analyses  demonstrated that o <dig> strains with the same h-type clustered together  but their corresponding serogroups were cladded into multiple independent lineages . scattered distribution patterns of virulence factors and resistance genes, as well as phylogenetic analysis of these different o <dig> strains may suggest that strains from individual lineages might have acquired virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes independently in parallel evolutionary processes.figure  <dig>

stx and eae genotypes
shiga toxins stx <dig> and stx <dig> are recognized as the most important phage-encoded virulence factors in all disease-associated stec strains, and the genes encoding for these toxins are located in the genome of mobile bacteriophages  <cit> . the stx phages are genetically distinct groups of temperate phages that can be identified in their prophage states inserted in the stec chromosome, but also can be detected as phages released from the bacteria into the environment and/or animal hosts. stx phages can exist in polluted waters, feces, food, in humans, and the environment  <cit> . generally speaking, phages could be used to detect and to derive lineage/evolution of newly emerged stec strains from different hosts and/or environments  <cit> . the diagram in figure 4a demonstrates significant diversity in gene sequence and structure to the predicted stx prophage region among serotypes o104:h <dig> , o104:h <dig> , o104:h <dig> , and o104:h <dig> . sequence alignment and the linkage pattern analysis  among o <dig> strains confirm that the region of predicted stx prophage shares weak sequence similarity among o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> strains. there was high sequence similarity among german outbreak strains  but not to africa strain c734- <dig>  there were at least four different types of stx bacteriophages found in the o <dig> strains analyzed in this study . the details of stx phage modular genetic structure in various o <dig> strains are illustrated on the diagram of figure 4a. genomic sequence analysis of the european outbreak o104:h <dig> strains showed that all isolates possessed stx2a and some also carried stx2c, stx2d, or the combination of stx2a, stx2c, and stx2d genes . stec strains that carry specific stx <dig> subtypes, especially stx2a, stx2c, and stx2d tend to be more virulent  <cit> . in this study, activatable stx2d was found to be the sole stx gene in our sequenced o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> strains. sequence analysis also revealed that none of the o <dig> strains harbored the stx2e, stx2f, or stx2g alleles.figure  <dig>

eae is another important virulence gene of epec, ehec, and stec strains. the three prominent lee integration sites selenocystyl-trna , pheu, and phev were previously described  <cit> . the different insertion sites of the lee in various stec suggest that the acquisition of lee may depend on the strain genetic backgrounds, the environmental conditions to which the strain is exposed, and the mechanisms of genetic recombination. our analysis showed that the o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> do not possess eae genes. it has been reported that serotype o104:h− carried an eae-tau  variant. strains expressing eae-tau were generally restricted to and efficiently colonized peyer’s patches in human intestinal mucosa  <cit> ; so far, serotype o104:h− has been found only in humans  <cit> . schmidt and colleagues  <cit>  reported a pai in e. coli o91:h− that occurs exclusively in a subgroup of stec strains that are eae negative and contain the variant stx2d gene, similar to o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> in this study.

also interestingly, a dna fragment containing the lee-encoded translocated-intimin receptor  effector gene from serotype o104:h <dig> strain 4051– <dig> was sequenced ; however tir was missing in all o104:h <dig>  o104h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> strains examined in the current study . the tir gene is typically encoded by the lee, flanked by orf <dig>  and eae  although the whole genome sequence of o104:h <dig> strain 4051– <dig> is not available currently. the functional tir protein is translocated into the epithelial cell and is integrated into the cell membrane where it functions as a receptor for eae. oswald and coworkers  <cit>  showed that allelic differences in eae were associated with differences in tissue and host specificity. thus, it is possible that o <dig> strains belonging to h <dig> or h <dig> serotype possess the eaec or ehec genetic background to acquire functional genes of various pais or eae variants . a detailed description of figure  <dig> is presented in next section.figure  <dig>

identification and analysis of prophages, genomic islands, and/or pathogenicity islands
the number of predicted prophages varied greatly among various o <dig> h-type strains . our analyses showed the distribution of different types of bacteriophages, particularly the stx2-carrying prophages, in the genomes of o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> supporting the hypothesis that the different h-serotypes of o <dig> may acquire diverse types of bacteriophages due to a possible genome adaptation to niches  <cit> . for instance, the similarity between bacteriophage types in the genomes of o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> shown in  suggested that they may come from the same evolutionary path or evolved in a similar environment.

an integrated comparative genomic program known as islandviewer was used to identify genomic islands  and/or pais that may have been introduced into the genome by horizontal gene transfer . by directly applying islandviewer for the identification of gis in the genomes of o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and the o104:h <dig> reference strain , we found that the percentage of horizontally transferred genomic islands varied from  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % among o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and the o104:h <dig> reference strain. the conserved gis are identified by aligning all gis in the reference strain o104:h <dig> to the gis in other o <dig> strains. we found the conserved gi pools represented  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the “reference genomic islands” from nc_ <dig> in o104:h <dig> strains lb <dig>  ty <dig>  c734- <dig>  c754- <dig>  c777- <dig>  c760- <dig>  o104:h <dig> 94– <dig>  and o104:h <dig> rm <dig>  respectively. o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> appeared to be closer to each other and the o104:h <dig> c760- <dig> strain from africa than to other o104:h <dig> strains, which is consistent with the phylogenetic tree in figure 3a.

pais belong to a specialized class of gis. they carry multiple virulence loci, may take up a large chromosomal region  of pathogens, are absent from non-pathogens, and usually have a different gc content from that of the core genome. a pai from an o103:h− strain which is inserted into the selc site between yici and nlpa  contains  <dig> orfs encoding proteins with ≥  <dig> deduced amino acids and one selc site . the proteins encoded in this island include a novel serine protease espi ; an adherence-associated locus, similar to iha of e. coli o157:h <dig> ; an e. coli vitamin b <dig> receptor ; an arac-type regulatory module ; and several other important and/or unknown function proteins. the remaining sequence consists largely of complete and incomplete insertion sequences, prophage sequences, and an intact phage integrase gene that is located directly downstream of the chromosomal selc  <cit> . a pairwise alignment of the selc-trna loci between yici and nlpa to this typical o <dig> pai shows some interesting genomic structural differences among o <dig> h-serotypes, o103:h−, o157:h <dig>  non-o <dig> stec, and other serotypes including e. coli k- <dig> . all of these strains shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> share the same gene structure at the n-terminal  and c-terminal , but none of these serotypes are genetically similar in the central portion of this typical pai structure.figure  <dig>

the genomic region of the selc site in o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> is 7775 bp and it encodes no known functional proteins. here we propose the concept of “pseudo pai”, a genomic region less than 10 kb in size that lacks key functional gene products typically found in o157:h <dig> and o103:h− . interestingly, strains carrying “pseudo pai” in this selc site normally have smaller genome sizes and they could have lower pathogenicity if they also lack plasmids carrying virulence genes. it is important to note that the eae gene has at least  <dig> different variants and one of the subtypes, eae-tau, has been isolated from patients with hemolytic-uremic syndrome in o104:h−   <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the presence and size of the pai in the selc trna locus also shows no correlation with serotype. a “pseudo pai”  was found in strains of serotypes o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  o111:h−, o113:h <dig>  o121:h <dig>  o91:h <dig>  o103:h <dig>  o103:h <dig>  o26:h <dig>  and even non-pathogenic e. coli k <dig>  these differences in the size of the functional pais  or “pseudo pai” among the same serogroup was also observed for o <dig> and o103:h− . these observations are suggestive of the acquisition of the different pais by the same serotype, including o104:h <dig> strains due to their different ecological niches and/or the geographical regions where they were found. the selc site can be targeted by bacteriophage carrying lee or lee-like pais , bacteriophage harboring resistance genes   through horizontal genetic transfer  and adaptation to new ecological niches, or it can remain empty .

as stated above, within different types of pai inserted into the selc site, genes that may encode antibiotic resistance, are associated with altered metabolism, or that express virulence factors are located in the central portion of the island and are surrounded by mobility-associated genes . mobile genetic elements  are extensively interspersed throughout the genome of serotype o104:h <dig>  but less so in o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> , particularly o104:h <dig> . however, schmidt and coworkers  <cit>  indicated that lee in o91:h− was flanked by prophage sequences and was devoid of is-related sequences, which were only shown in o157:h <dig> in figure  <dig>  our data may indicate that o <dig> h-serotypes could acquire pai with or without an intact or a portion of lee by phage transduction or hgt, which potentially could make o <dig> h-serotypes more pathogenic. at present, it is not known if the pais in different o <dig> h-serotypes were in the process of stepwise insertion of genes into the region, or stepwise deletion of genes from the “original” pai, similar to those in o <dig> and o91:h- serotypes via complex mechanisms of horizontal transfer and/or recombination. a novel pai, originally identified in o103:h− and o91:h−, was also partially found in one o <dig> h− serotype but showed some rearrangement .

based on our analyses, we propose an evolutionary model  in the selc-trna site of various h-serotypes of e. coli o <dig> strains in a stepwise insertion fashion. this model suggests that o104:h− and o104:h <dig> may derive from the ancestral o104:h <dig> or o104:h <dig> by the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes  or eae-tau carried by a prophage/pai  and other genetic components, such as the plasmid carrying aggr gene. various o <dig> strains were also shown to carry stx <dig>  <cit>  , implicating that within the o <dig> serogroup there are multiple acquisition events of prophage, gi, and/or pai. pais can excise at different frequencies depending on growth conditions  <cit> . this suggests that genetic versatility is needed for the survival of e. coli in diverse environments, which may be relevant regarding its host specificity, as well.

chromosome- and/or plasmid- encoded virulence genes, crispr, and is elements among o <dig> strains
the most noticeable difference in the genomes of these o <dig> serogroups was the presence of various types of mobile genetic elements, and the variations in the numbers of chromosome-encoded virulence genes. the h <dig>  h <dig>  and h4-specific flic, wzx, wzy, eae, bfpa , stx <dig>  stx <dig>  efa <dig>  ent/espl <dig>  tir, nleb and nlee , espk , tehb, iha, and o104- and o157-specific lpfa, tccp, tccp <dig>  is <dig> integrase, and the crispr <dig> sequence were used to define serogroup and pathogroups of o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and other o104:h <dig> strains. based on the genotypic differences, e. coli pathotypes can be categorized as atypical epec , typical epec , stec , ehec , aggr-positive eahec , and aggr-negative eahec/stec . these virulence factors and o- and h-antigen specific genes are useful for molecular characterization of epec, stec, ehec and eahec strains at the genomic level . the e. coli o104:h <dig> european outbreak strain contains a stx-encoding phage similar to 933 w with only one nucleotide polymorphism in each of the subunits  compared to 933 w. the german outbreak o104:h <dig> strains  also contain genes encoding several important serine protease autotransporter toxins, including sepa , siga , pic , aap , aatpabcd , and others; however, none of these were found in the sequenced o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> strains . aside from c760- <dig>  o104:h <dig> strains from africa did not carry noteworthy virulence factors other than the iha gene; however, c777- <dig> possessed the stx <dig> gene, thus indicating potential virulence . strain o104:h <dig> rm <dig> and all o104:h <dig> isolates carried virulence genes that included lpf  and iha  that are associated with ehec and colonization of the gut, but lacked the aggr, aggb-c-d modular genes .

the stx1- and stx2c- prophages are normally flanked by integrative element is <dig> at both ends in almost all o <dig> and non-o <dig> stec, including o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  our analysis of the stx prophages indicated that the transposable insertion sequence element is <dig> may be a driver of stx <dig> and stx2c prophage evolution among o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and other lee-negative stec strains. we have hypothesized that stx genes may excise from african strains after infection, owing to a functional change of a putative integrase near the yqga  gene due to frameshift- and nonsense-mutations. after transposition, there is only one is <dig> left in o104:h <dig>  is <dig> insertion is highly biased toward prophages and prophage-like integrative elements. both is <dig> and is <dig> are not present in o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> but exist in all o104:h <dig> strains . is <dig> also appears to be part of kanamycin  resistance transposons  <cit> . in addition, o104:h4-specific crispr <dig> was not found in any of the other stec strains examined in this study , including o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig>  the presence and the functions of crispr <dig>  <cit>  may play a significant role in o104:h <dig> for maintaining a high degree of genomic plasticity and flexibility for adapting to host and environmental changes. analysis of is <dig> and crispr distribution among o <dig> strains might be useful for identification and detection of specific o <dig> strains and population genetic analysis, as well as molecular epidemiology studies. the presence of is <dig>  crispr, and prophage regions  may potentially contribute to the larger genome size of o104:h <dig> .

there was no apparent correlation between serotypes and plasmid profiles among o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> strains, as well as other non-o <dig> stec strains . there was marked variability in the numbers and types of genes carried by the plasmids in the o <dig> strains ; none of the  <dig> e. coli o <dig> isolates carried the same set of plasmids. stec o104:h <dig> rm <dig> had four plasmids, while most other o <dig> strains carried only  <dig> or  <dig> plasmids. the following genes used to define eaec, stec, and ehec strains were located on some plasmids: aggr, aggbcd cluster , saa, ecf cluster, ehx cluster, etp cluster , toxb , katp , espp, espa, sepa , subab, typeiv pilus gene cluster, mabb, stce , and exca , in agreement with other previous reports  <cit> . these genes are useful for the molecular detection and characterization of stec, eaec, and ehec strains. a comparison of the various o <dig> strains revealed that subab , the ehx cluster, espp, and exca were found in o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and lee-negative o113:h <dig> strains, but not in o104:h <dig> strains. therefore, it is suggested that virulence of the o104:h <dig> outbreak strain may be due in part to plasmid-associated virulence genes, including subab, the ehx cluster, and espp . in table  <dig>  only o104:h <dig> strains and an o111:h <dig> strain carried the transcriptional activator aggr and/or the aggregate b-c-d gene cluster . subab was more prevalent in lee-negative than in lee-positive stec strains and likely contributes to the progression to severe disease  <cit> , since the o113:h <dig> strain was involved in an outbreak with cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome .table  <dig>

antibiotic resistance gene profiling
there were a number of genes related to antibiotic resistance in o104:h <dig>  the o104:h <dig> outbreak strains were resistant to at least  <dig> different antibiotics including ampicillin, sulfonamide, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid, but were susceptible to imipenem, kanamycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin  <cit> . the o104:h <dig> outbreak strain carried a plasmid, pesbl, that encodes for extended spectrum β-lactamase ctx-m- <dig>  <cit> . although the actual plasmid sequences were not available, genomic analysis showed that the four o104:h <dig> strains isolated from africa carried some resistance genes , but not as many as the o104:h <dig> strains of european origin . on the other hand, o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> strains did not carry the plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance genes found in the german outbreak o104:h <dig> strains . these antibiotic resistance genes listed in table  <dig> may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer by transposon-based plasmid integration . the analysis of the plasmid profiles of various o <dig> h-types and other stec serotypes  is consistent with the observation that ehec plasmid-encoded genes , including hly cluster, exca, suba/b, espp, were only found in stec o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> strains, but not in o104:h <dig> strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the milk-associated outbreak stec o104:h <dig> strain 94– <dig> and the o104:h <dig> cattle isolate rm <dig> were shot-gun sequenced, analyzed, and compared to elucidate the potential relationship, origin, and evolution of bacterial pathogenesis in various o <dig> h-serotypes. the observed variation between different o <dig> h-serotype genomes demonstrated that genome-wide divergence likely occurred via acquisition and loss of genomic islands, prophages, and plasmids. the genetic diversity in o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> serotypes was reflected in differences in virulence and resistance genes carried on the chromosome and on plasmids, suggesting their independent evolution demonstrated by different distribution and types of genetic mobile elements.

genetic diversity of stx <dig> bacteriophages among o104:h <dig>  o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig> is illustrated in figure  <dig>  further studies are needed to define the sources  of these stx phages and to determine the frequency of lysogenization of e. coli o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> and phage origin by comparing to stx2-carrying phages from e. coli o104:h <dig> and other non-o <dig> eaec/stec strains. their roles in dynamic bacterial genome evolution have been increasingly highlighted by the fact that many sequenced bacterial genomes contain multiple prophages carrying a wide range of genes, such as stx and antimicrobial resistance genes.

bacteriophages are major genetic factors promoting horizontal gene transfer  between bacteria. in this study, a “pseudo selc-trna site pai” was defined containing perfect direct repeats and transposons, but was less than 10-kb in length . the results in figure  <dig> indicated that o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> may represent various insertion intermediates of the o104:h <dig> strain generated in the course of o <dig> evolution. our data provide new insights into the potential activities of the functional prophages embedded in bacterial genomes and may lead to the formulation of a novel concept of inter-prophage interactions in prophage communities. that is to say, strains containing prophage without genetic defects may be potentially more capable of spreading  important virulence determinants such as eae and other genetic traits to other bacterial strains . our findings suggest that more research is needed to understand the potential roles of prophage in hgt between bacteria and in the evolution of bacterial pathogens.

a key virulence factor, stx <dig>  was found in all european o104:h <dig> outbreak strains, but only in one of the strains of african origin  . this finding supports the contention that similarly virulent o104:h <dig> isolates could be widespread; however, they could be genetically different due to their adaption to specific niches. it is also suggestive that both o104:h <dig> and o104:h <dig> may have evolved into pathogenic stec strains due to the acquisition of stx, other virulence genes, and antibiotic resistance genes such as mdtl, emre, ksga, ydeb, dacc, fola-o <dig>  and others from other stec. it is reasonable to suggest that genetic variation of stec o <dig> may partly be due to adaptation to local environments and interactions with other bacteria and hosts. serotypes o104:h− and o104:h <dig> have been isolated from humans and associated with hus, thus it is also important that future studies examine the pathogenic potential of different o <dig> h-types, other than h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>
