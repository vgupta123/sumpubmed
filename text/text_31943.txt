BACKGROUND
recently there have been attempts to correlate published microarrays, using software that can analyze many thousands of microarrays at one time. one such program is called oncomine™  <cit> , where each study within oncomine™ is in essence a collection of individual microarrays from many patient samples <cit> . these "multi-arrays" usually utilise either normal or tumour biopsy samples , from various tissue sources.

one function of oncomine™ is a search tool where the user's chosen gene is correlated in expression, within multi-arrays, with other genes in the array . for example searching p <dig>  gives several correlations in many multi-arrays. focusing within the study whitney_normal there is a high correlation with expression of fibrillarin, over the  <dig> blood samples tested . in samples where p <dig> expression was diminished, so was fibrillarin, and conversely when p <dig> expression was high, so is that of fibrillarin. this result is made more significant given that p <dig> and fibrillarin have previously been shown to interact together <cit> .

correlations like this can show if proteins may be in the same pathway , although it cannot show more than association. in an attempt to further increase the stringency of oncomine™ to elude to these pathways we chose to test the dead-box proteins p <dig> and p <dig> because they are highly similar proteins that interact together and have been shown to be involved in defined cellular functions including splicing and transcription, which can then be used as a quality control measure of this technique  <cit> . also as p <dig> and p <dig> are so similar there is the possibility that they may to some extent be functionally redundant.

in total this means that we can perform a meta-analysis of p <dig> coexpressed genes independent to that of p <dig>  then compare the results for overlap . if the gene lists were to give a significant overlap then this would act to support the notion that the technique is highly selective. our results reveal that, not only does this technique corroborate previously published data on p <dig> and p <dig>  it also generates testable predictions of novel pathway partners of p <dig> and p <dig> 

RESULTS
overlapping coexpressed genes of p <dig> and p72
multi-arrays chosen for meta-analysis had many individual samples/microarrays, indicating that a good correlation coefficient given by oncomine™ is already highly significant. figure 1c indicates the chosen multi-array studies for p <dig> and p <dig>  note that there is almost a 50% overlap of studies chosen.

meta-analysis results, with frequency of  <dig> or more, for p <dig> yielded a higher volume of hits than for p <dig> . both of these lists were compared for common genes and the common list was further assessed for ontology and full gene names . remarkably, we observed a large number of overlapping genes, indicative of the stringency employed in this technique.

 <dig> genes were identified to be both coexpressed with p <dig> and p <dig>  and are arranged by function. for clarity all coexpressed gene products with a 30% or greater coexpression frequency correlation for either p <dig> or p <dig> are in bold.

even when the stringency was further augmented by increasing the p <dig> frequency cut-off to  <dig> or more multi-arrays , this lost almost  <dig> p <dig> hits, but only reduced the number of overlapping genes with p <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> . the highest frequency of overlap of p <dig> and p <dig> occurred in splicing, consistent with previous reports of their role in this process. further validation of this technique was observed by the reciprocal gene hits of p <dig> and p <dig> , again consistent with their interaction within the same pathways.

the next most abundant function of p <dig> and p <dig> appeared to be in transcription , once more consistent with previous reports. this is especially interesting given that p <dig> and p <dig> were previously shown to act as coactivators for the nuclear receptor estrogen receptor α  transcription factor, and we have identified x-box binding protein  <dig> , associated with the erα pathway. we have also identified  <dig> other nuclear receptor pathway proteins, the thyroid hormone receptor associated protein  <dig>  and the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α  transcription factor.

rna helicase a coexpresses and interacts with p <dig> and p72
a further interesting transcription-associated gene identified was rna helicase a , a member of a similar protein family to p <dig> and p <dig>  all of which have been shown to interact with p300/cbp coactivators <cit> . the frequency for both p <dig> and p <dig> were observed to be high for rna helicase a .

for this reason a similar coexpression analysis was separately performed for dhx <dig>  surprisingly, not only were p <dig> and p <dig> reciprocally coregulated with dhx <dig>  but over 50% of the p68:p <dig> overlapped positives were also coexpressed with dhx <dig> . this was powerful evidence linking dhx <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> to similar pathways.

as this overlap was so high it was possible that p <dig> and p <dig> were functioning in the same complex as dhx <dig>  this was tested experimentally in hek <dig> cells. with immunoprecipitation of either transiently transfected p <dig> or p <dig> we observed a clear interaction with endogenous dhx <dig> . further imunoprecipitations of endogenous p <dig> and p <dig> from lysate of mouse liver confirmed the interaction with dhx <dig> . this was performed after incubation with rnasea, indicating a protein:protein interaction . in the liver extract p <dig> and p <dig> also strongly immunoprecipitated a protein of  <dig> kda, recognised by the dhx <dig> antibody . it currently remains unclear if this is a different isoform of dhx <dig> or a cross-reacting protein.

altogether, these data both supported the hypothesis of p68/p72/dhx <dig> existing within the same complex, and further acted as strong evidence of the predictive capabilities of the oncomine™ analysis technique described here.

other coexpressed genes of p <dig> and p72
interestingly, there were  <dig> overlapped hits in the ubiquitin pathway  which may be related to the observation that p <dig> is highly ubiquitinated in colon cancers <cit> . p <dig> was also recently shown to be sumo modified, specifically sumo- <dig> by pias <dig> ligase <cit> . here we shown that pias <dig> is coexpressed with p68/p <dig>  and sumo- <dig> is coexpressed with p <dig> 

p68/p <dig> have also recently been shown to interact in a complex with ilf <dig>  hnrnpu, and hnrnph <dig> for microrna processing <cit> . here, these gene products are also shown to be highly coexpressed with p <dig> and p <dig>  supporting their role in the same complex/pathway .

in a separate study a group of proteins were identified in an mrnp complex with p <dig> and are here shown to be coexpressed with p68/p <dig>   <cit> .

a new role for p <dig> and p <dig>  suggested by our meta-analysis, might be in nuclear transport, given that a member of nuclear pore complex  as well as nuclear import  and export  genes were identified as coexpressed genes.

furthermore, coexpressed genes presented here are not limited to nuclear processes given that several cytoskeletal proteins are identified in the screening, implicating p <dig> and p <dig> in these processes . this is also true for endoplasmic reticulum  or golgi proteins. indeed, the rab6a trafficking protein had the highest frequency overlap for p <dig> , while being one of the lowest for p <dig> , possibly indicative of a functional difference between both. the family member rab <dig> was also identified for both.

a further significant group of genes identified were involved in signal transduction, and may provide a start into analysis of regulation of p <dig> and p <dig> .

altogether the results of the overlapping coexpressed genes not only reiterate previous studies with either p68/p <dig> but predict new potential pathways in which p68/p <dig> may act.

selected non-overlapping coexpressed genes of p <dig> and p72
while p <dig> and p <dig> may be highly similar and involved in the same pathways, it remains likely that they are also involved in subtly different pathways. for this reason a similar ontology analysis was performed on genes that do not overlap between p <dig> and p <dig>  however, given the extensive nature of the gene hits we selected all genes with frequency overlap above 30%, as well as some genes of interest from lower frequencies .

all coexpressed but non-overlapping gene products for p <dig> and p <dig> over 30% frequency are shown . selected coexpressed gene products below 30% are shown and were chosen based on interest and common ontology groups.

for p <dig> the genes above 30% generally fell into the same categories as previously, while there was only  <dig> gene identified for p <dig>  with no obvious molecular function. of-course the selected genes below 30% were chosen based on interest and common ontological groupings, and may not be representative. however, we note that for p <dig> more rab family members are identified  as well as more er proteins, particularly protein folding chaperones .

with regard to transcription, p <dig> coexpressed with elk <dig> and hdac <dig> transcriptional repressors, while p <dig> coexpressed with ctbp <dig> and hdac <dig> repressors. this might be relevant given that p <dig> and p <dig> have been shown to act as transcriptional repressors, hypothesised to have different mechanisms of action as they act in a promoter-specific manner <cit> . however it has been shown that ctbp <dig> repressive function is antagonized by pinin <cit> , and here, both p <dig> and p <dig> also coexpress with pinin  <cit> . p <dig> has also been shown to be involved in p <dig> coactivation <cit> , and here we identify a coexpressed p <dig> coactivator hnrnpk <cit>  for p68/p <dig> and the p53-induced protein  <dig> , for p <dig>  for other transcription roles for p <dig> there were more nuclear receptor pathway proteins including thyroid receptor interacting protein  <dig> ,thrap <dig> , estrogen receptor binding protein , and the retinoic acid receptor alpha  transcription factor. p <dig> coexpressed with the er-alpha repressor mta <dig>  we have also observed that p <dig> coexpressed gene znf <dig> is in the same pathway as p68/p <dig> coexpressed mbnl <dig>  implicated in myotonic dystrophy <cit> .

for p <dig> we note that nono  has been shown to interact with sfpq/psf <cit>  . furthermore edd , also identified here with p <dig>  has been shown in a complex with sfpq <cit> . remarkably p <dig> has also very recently been shown to interact in a complex with nono and sfpq/psf <cit> , again confirming the validity of the technique described here.

discussion
the technique described here has proven useful in increasing the stringency of oncomine™ meta-analysis, and will prove to be widely applicable. generally individual gene levels cannot be compared from one study to another, but the strength of our analysis is an inter-study comparison  after an intra-study oncomine™ analysis .

while we still retain the strongest  <dig> coexpressed genes from each multi-array, it becomes de-sorted when analyzing for frequency over different studies. an example is edem <dig> , which is consistently one of the strongest correlated genes with p <dig>  while having only a 32% frequency overlap. the same is true for p <dig> and sp <dig> transcription factor with a frequency overlap of 37%, and very highly coexpressed in these individual studies. conversely, the technique described here is useful for comparison of coexpressed genes which may not always have a high coexpression coefficient, giving another advantage over analysis of single studies.

an interesting exception is rab6a with p <dig> which has both the highest frequency overlap with p <dig>  and is almost always within the first  <dig> genes coexpressed with p <dig> in individual multi-array studies. a further exception is rna helicase a  which again has a high frequency of overlap with p <dig>  and usually is within the first  <dig> coexpressed genes with p <dig>  we have also shown here for the first time an interaction by immunoprecipitation of p <dig> , with dhx <dig> 

furthermore, the technique described here is most useful in clustering specific genes involved in pathways when meta-analysis hits from known interacting proteins can be overlapped. we observed with our example of p <dig> and p <dig> that the overlapping hits mainly clustered into the classes of ontology in which p68/p <dig> had already been reported, namely splicing and transcription, further acting as validation for this type of analysis.

while some new proposed pathways for p68/p <dig> cannot be through direct action  it remains possible that p68/p <dig> are involved in these pathways indirectly via splicing/transcription/controlling nuclear shuttling. we were encouraged by the fact that p <dig> and/or p <dig> coexpressed with previously published interacting proteins such as one-another, ilf <dig>  hnrnph <dig>  hnrnpu, hnrnpa2/b <dig>  sfrs <dig>  ddx3x, pias <dig>  sumo <dig>  pinin, nono and sfpq and were further encouraged by observation of coexpression with members of pathways in which they were previously shown to act, such as estrogen receptor pathway , ubiquitin pathway , translation , and transcriptional repression .

there also seems to be a more general role for p <dig> and p <dig> in nuclear receptor transcription pathways than first assumed , for example jmjd1c, thrap <dig>  thrap <dig>  rara, rora, all coexpress with p <dig> and/or p <dig> 

while it is clear that we have obtained a highly stringent list of potential pathway partners of p <dig> and p <dig>  with regard to separable functions  we cannot say with confidence as genes generally clustered into the same pathways as for the overlapping list. this may be due to a high false-negative rate of this technique as we have used several levels of stringency, and will most likely exclude many true pathway partners of p <dig> and p <dig>  however, this cost is offset by high quality results using our rigorous analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
it is apparent that we have increased the scope of the oncomine™ database, by utilising frequency of coexpression  over different multi-array studies to predict pathway partners of searched proteins. with regard to the p <dig> and p <dig> rna helicases we have identified a non-exhaustive list of gene products that are likely to be present in various pathways in which p <dig> and/or p <dig> act, both corroborating previous studies and making novel predictions. for one of these, rna helicase a, we have shown there is a direct interaction with p <dig> and p <dig>  future experimental studies using this list as a reference point will reveal the validity of this technique.
