BACKGROUND
the first genome-wide rnai screen performed in c. elegans proved to be a milestone, for the first time each predicted gene of a metazoan could be inactivated and the observed effects characterized in a systematic way  <cit> . since then, steady improvements have been made to the rnai feeding method, in particular the possibility to perform rnai screens in liquid in a 96-well format  <cit> . the current methodology is appropriate to address gene function in either a wild type background or a mutated background. however, the current method becomes very difficult to apply when the question to be addressed is to determine the role of a particular gene in relation to multiple genetic backgrounds or genotypes . this problem mainly occurs because rnai effects were not quantifiable when performed at a high throughput rate. we sought to solve this problem by developing a high throughput method that generates quantitative data fully amenable to statistical analyzes that allows us to tease apart the contribution of individual genetic backgrounds to a specific process.

the basic principle of the method is to assess the fitness of a population of animals by measuring the rate at which e. coli is consumed. typically, an experiment assesses the fitness over a period of  <dig> days. this generates fitness curves , which are amenable to statistics. various analyzes can be performed on the curves using parameters such as the slope, the mean, the time required to consume 50% of the food, the difference between first and last readings, or even the surface above the area of the curve. here, we mainly used variation on the slope, since this parameter can capture most of the effects observed on the fcs.

we demonstrate that our approach is robust by mapping the c. elegans loss of rnai sensitivity trait using diverse genetic backgrounds. we took advantage of recombinant inbred lines  that were produced by mating two diverse genetic backgrounds n <dig>  and cb <dig> . this ril population has extensively been used to map a range of quantitative traits  <cit> . hence, we used these previously described rils  <cit>  and a number of new rils . the n <dig>  background is rnai sensitive whereas the cb <dig>  background is rnai insensitive in the germline  <cit> . using quantitative trait loci  mapping, we identified ppw- <dig>  a gene causal to the rnai insensitivity of the cb <dig> germline  <cit> . importantly, we performed a detailed genotype-to-phenotype analysis that provides evidence that loss of rnai sensitivity is a complex trait, in which ppw- <dig> is one of probably several rnai sensitivity modifiers. in total,  <dig> genetic backgrounds were tested using  <dig> rnai treatments. analyzing such a number of genetic backgrounds has never been performed before, but critically this is the first time that quantitative data have been produced for rnai treatments in c. elegans.

RESULTS
bristol  and hawaii  respond differently to rnai treatments
bristol and hawaii react very differently when exposed to rnai. rnai in bristol is highly effective, but in hawaii rnai sensitivity for germline expressed genes has been lost  <cit> . therefore, we reasoned that our fitness assay should be ideal to differentiate between these two rnai sensitivity behaviors. for example, if we target an essential gene that functions in the germline, bristol will die, but not hawaii. we performed rnai in both strains on a panel of  <dig> rnai clones: four clones  are known to be more effective in bristol than in hawaii  <cit> ; two clones  are known to be effective in both natural isolates  <cit> ; one clone  is used as a negative control since it affects vulval development, a non-essential organ for viability  <cit> ; four clones  have never been tested before for comparison between bristol and hawaii; and the empty vector clone is used as a control or a reference. we have analyzed the data generated from the fitness assay in two ways: i) by comparing each rnai condition to the empty vector for each strain and ii) by analyzing whether bristol responds differently from hawaii to specific rnai treatments.

in the first part of the analysis, we found that eight out of eleven rnai treatments caused a reduction in fitness in bristol  and table 1). these rnai treatments have been previously shown to cause lethality, to reduce fertility, or to reduce growth rate  <cit> , all these parameters are predicted to affect the rate of food consumption. we were not able to detect an effect with let- <dig> and mpk- <dig>  indicating that rnai conditions in liquid may have been less efficient for these specific cases. rnai by feeding has been shown to produce a high rate of false negative results but a very low rate of false positive results  <cit> . we next analyzed the fcs produced in the hawaii strain. only the rab- <dig> and tag- <dig> treatments can produce fcs that are significantly different from the reference , likely because these genes are functional outside the germline  and table 1).

the second column indicates differences that can be detected between the rnai treatment and the control  in bristol. p values are derived from time points  <dig> to  <dig> except for  <dig>  in which time points  <dig> to  <dig> were used . the third column indicates differences that can be detected between the rnai treatment and the control  in hawaii. the last column is a comparison between bristol and hawaii.

in the second and most innovative part of our analysis, we compared the fcs obtained from the same rnai treatment between bristol and hawaii. accordingly, bristol and hawaii do not respond differentially to empty vector, mpk- <dig>  the control lin- <dig>  and rab- <dig> . however, we observed differential responses with rnai targeting mel- <dig>  pos- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig>  gld- <dig>  smo- <dig> and let- <dig>  and table 1). surprisingly, tag- <dig> appears to produce a differential response suggesting that the rnai treatment was more effective in hawaii than bristol. detailed analysis would be required to confirm this observation. taken together, these results show that rnai treatment effects can produce data consistent with previous studies  <cit> . importantly, these data can be quantified when applied onto diverse genetic backgrounds or genotypes.

ppw- <dig> is a modifier of rnai sensitivity
the differential effect for germline rnai sensitivity observed between bristol and hawaii is attributed to ppw- <dig>  <cit> . ppw- <dig> is an rna binding protein of the piwi family, which is important to maintain rnai sensitivity of genes presumably active in the germline. however, rnai sensitivity can also be mediated at a general level, such as in the case of an rde- <dig> mutant, in which rnai sensitivity is totally lost  <cit> . to distinguish between these general and germline-specific effects, we tested rde- <dig> and ppw- <dig> mutants and compared them with bristol and hawaii, respectively. looking at the fcs, we can readily detect that the rde- <dig> mutant lost total rnai sensitivity . therefore, all the rnai effects observed in bristol require the general rnai machinery and cannot be attributed to generic culture condition problems. in contrast, the ppw- <dig> mutant fcs nicely phenocopies the fcs obtained from the hawaii strain . therefore, loss of rnai sensitivity in hawaii is consistent with ppw- <dig> deleterious polymorphisms  <cit> .

rnai treatments of  <dig> rils identifies a shared qtl at the ppw- <dig> locus
polymorphisms in ppw- <dig> appear to explain the loss of germline rnai sensitivity in hawaii. however, even though the ppw- <dig> mutant behavior is consistent with this view, the previous study  <cit>  did not address or rule out whether other natural modifiers exist. since our method is able to detect differential rnai behaviors at a quantitative level, we tested if we could map the loss of germline rnai sensitivity trait using qtl analysis. for this purpose, we exposed  <dig> rils generated from a cross between bristol and hawaii  <cit> , and their respective parental strains, to our  <dig> rnai treatments. interestingly, we found a highly significant qtl on chromosome i, close to the ppw- <dig> locus . this qtl is especially strong for mel- <dig>  smo- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig> and pos- <dig> and harbours ppw- <dig> 

a genotype-to-phenotype analysis suggest that loss of rnai sensitivity is a complex trait
even though ppw- <dig> was previously identified as an important contributor to loss of rnai sensitivity, and that our results so far support this view, we tested at an individual level how well correlated the ppw- <dig> genotype is to the loss of germline rnai sensitivity phenotype. we first sequenced the ppw- <dig> locus for  <dig> rils and then analyzed whether the genotype can predict the phenotype, herein loss of germline rnai sensitivity. the prediction is that a genotype that matches with hawaii ppw- <dig> polymorphisms should cause loss of rnai sensitivity in the germline. vice versa, the rils with bristol ppw- <dig> polymorphisms should remain rnai sensitive. surprisingly, we found that in about 25% of the cases, we could not categorize the phenotype to either bristol-like or hawaii-like behavior . however, if we focused on the  <dig> rils  that can be categorized as either bristol-like  or hawaii-like , we found that in ~83% of the cases, the loss of rnai sensitivity trait correlates to hawaii ppw- <dig> . taken together, these results provide new evidence that loss of rnai sensitivity in hawaii is not entirely due to polymorphisms in ppw- <dig> and that other important rnai sensitivity modifiers must exist, even though ppw- <dig> is strong predictor of germline rnai sensitivity  <cit> .

factors affecting the fitness assay
here we show that our method is efficient at addressing the contribution of genetic variation on a specific trait, herein loss of germline rnai sensitivity. we think that the fitness assay will be useful to other groups interested in identifying the contribution that diverse genotypes may have to their phenotypes of interest. this may involve different treatments such as environmental stress or chemical compounds. the fitness assay is easy to implement in any c. elegans laboratory, but future users need to take into account two critical parameters for future adaptations of the fitness assay: the number of worms and the quantity of food. these parameters need to be optimized, in particular for strains displaying a low brood size or lethality.

for our purpose, the worms were seeded manually, but a multiwell dispenser could also be used. this apparatus can process a 96-well plate in about  <dig> seconds, but tends to be more variable than the manual method using a single channel pipette . we aimed at seeding  <dig> l <dig> worms per well for our experiments, and used duplicates for the manual method, however when using the multiwell dispenser we performed the experiments in triplicate. we directly tested the efficiency of our assay using the multiwell dispenser by performing six rnai treatments  over  <dig> rils. we found that we can still map a qtl at the ppw- <dig> locus for smo- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig> and mel- <dig> rnai treatments . this confirms that the multiwell dispenser can also be used to seed the worms to perform the fitness assay. even though not tested here, it is very likely that using a worm sorter, such as the copas , could reduce or perhaps eliminate the worm number issue and increase resolution.

the number of worms is an important factor in the fitness assay, but to what extent can it affect the interpretation of the data? to answer this point, we next addressed the sensitivity limit of the fitness assay by assessing the effect of worm numbers on the fitness curves . we have found that if the number of worms seeded has a variation of +/-  <dig> and that the average number of worms is  <dig>  the variation produced on the slopes is +/-  <dig>  od/hours . hence, changes within that range must be repeated/checked since the effect may be due to the variation on the number of worms seeded. on the other hand, an effect on the slope beyond this variation is very likely to be attributed to the applied treatment, herein rnai. in the experiment using the multiwell dispenser, the effects observed for rnai treatments that show a qtl on ppw- <dig> are far beyond the variation caused by worm number variation. for example the four genes smo- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig>  mel- <dig>  with a qtl on ppw- <dig> show an allelic difference for this parameter between the hawaii and bristol of respectively  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  od/hours, which is about two fold above the maximum variation possibly caused by varying worm numbers. we are therefore confident that the calculated effects on the fitness assay are caused by rnai treatments.

another important parameter is the quantity of food. we determined that for rnai a starting od of around  <dig>  units is appropriate. we have also found that if rnai is performed with half that amount of food, rnai effects are affected . indeed, the differential effect detected between hawaii and bristol disappears when the worms are treated with pos- <dig> or mel- <dig> . in summary, the ratio worms versus food is important and it may need to be adjusted according to different strains and food sources used.

sources of variation
as with any technique there is an associated technical variation. we addressed the extent of this by repeating, within a same experiment, multiple times the fitness assay. we found this technical variation to be minimal . however, there is a degree of variation between experiments  but this is easily accounted for by systematically adding the reference or parental strains. we address this point in the materials and methods section. to sum up, it is critical that each fitness assay experiment is self-contained, i.e. includes positive and negative controls for the specific treatment, herein rnai, and includes the reference strains, herein bristol and hawaii.

discussion
here we have presented a new assay that is both cost efficient and easy to set-up in any laboratory. the main advantage of the fitness assay is its ability to distinguish and quantify the effect of a specific treatment across multiple genetic backgrounds or genotypes . we show that this is particularly powerful to identify the qtl responsible for loss of germline rnai sensitivity in rils generated from bristol  and hawaii   <cit> . this study provides evidence that modifiers of this trait remain to be identified. the method is also versatile and other treatments could be used to decipher the contribution of natural genetic variation to specific traits, i.e. a drug response.

the fitness assay indicates the capacity of an animal population to eat at a certain rate. this rate is determined by multiple factors, including the number of progeny, the level of viability, and the rate of growth. in our selected set of rnai, we found that most targeted genes produced a significant effect on the fcs , which is in accordance with their previously described function. in addition, using data from kamath et al,  <dig>  we found that most phenotypes, around 75%, are due to embryonic lethality, a reduced brood size, or a growth defect. indicating that the majority of genes that produce a phenotype by rnai in bristol could be identified by our method. we tested this prediction by targeting  <dig> genes:  <dig> known to produce 'viability-related' defects, and  <dig> with no 'viability-related' defects reported by  <cit> . however, these latter  <dig> targets have been shown to have functions associated with signaling pathways, apoptosis or transcription . we found that 75% of the genes required for viability produced a phenotype in the fitness assay, indicating that most rnai treatments that produce a 'viability-related' phenotype would also produce a phenotype in the fitness assay . using the other set of targeted genes, we found that 60% of the rnai treatments have no effect. interestingly, the remaining 40% producing an effect on the fitness assay have been shown to play roles in wnt signaling , nuclear excision repair , notch signaling , apoptosis , translational repression , and transcription  . collectively, these data indicate that the phenotypes identified using the fitness assay mostly overlap with the data from kamath et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and that overall if we were to re-perform a genome-wide screen, we would miss some, but also detect a few new ones.

even though phenotypes confined to non-viable organs such as the vulva could be missed by our method, the signaling pathways involved are often functional in other organs, and these organs may be required to maintain viability. for example, vulval development requires the ras signaling pathway, but this pathway is also essential to the development of the excretory cell; and a malfunction of the excretory cell will cause larval lethality  <cit> . the fitness assay can identify this phenotype. there are alternatives methods that provide high-resolution phenotypic analysis. for example, high throughput image analysis increases phenotypic information, albeit at a reduced throughput  <cit> . however, most c. elegans laboratories do not have an up and running automated image-capture system. for these laboratories, the fitness assay remains the affordable option.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this is the first study that shows that rnai effects can be quantified in c. elegans. this is important since it will allow us to understand the contribution of diverse genetic backgrounds to complex traits. for example, there is the concept that medicine should be personalized, in part because of genetic variation between humans. perhaps fundamental principles of genetic variation could be derived from studies performed in recombinant inbred lines in c. elegans, and these could help develop the field of personalized medicine research.
