BACKGROUND
each year approximately  <dig>  persons are diagnosed with epilepsy, and about  <dig>  of these individual develop drug-resistant epilepsy  <cit> . the causes of drug-resistant epilepsy are numerous, many due to ontogenic abnormalities in brain maturation, severe brain injuries with resultant irreversible changes to cerebral neuroglial organization and inhibitory neuron function, kindling phenomenon, seizure-induced disturbances of oxygen supply, as well as acquired  changes in transporter proteins of the blood-brain barrier which function in the efflux of anti-epileptic drugs  from the brain. the latter mechanisms have been the focus of intense efforts to develop new rationally designed aeds that could bypass these transport mechanisms. unfortunately, the identity of the multiple transport mechanisms of the blood brain barrier, and the individual role of each in mediating drug-resistant epilepsy is as yet incompletely defined.

the abc-family transporters have been the subject of considerable interest in the mechanisms of drug-resistant epilepsy  <cit> . the prototypical abc transporter, p-glycoprotein , as well as mrp <dig>  and bcrp are expressed in the blood-brain barrier  <cit> . endothelial expression of pgp has been demonstrated, and the role of pgp in regulating brain drug-concentrations has been established in knockout mouse studies  <cit> . these studies evaluated the transport of a number of centrally acting drugs including antipsychotics, ant emetics, and natural product antineoplastic agents. the only aed examined, phenytoin , appeared to be a weak substrate of pgp in intact cell transport experiments. carbamazepine  has been found not to inhibit pgp mediated transport, thus would be a poor substrate  <cit> . recently, studies examining the ability of aed to competitively inhibit the transport activity of pgp have found little effect of aeds on pgp activity, and then only at concentrations well above clinically achieved therapeutic levels  <cit> . although pgp appears to mediate some minor transport activity towards most cns active agent, the greatest csf/plasma ratios  were seen with antipsychotics and antiemetics rather than aeds, evidence has been presented which suggests that there have been no reports directly demonstrating transport of any aed by pgp in an isolated system  <cit> .

in epileptic patients, expression of mdr <dig> has a complex pattern that does not directly support a significant pharmacokinetic role for mdr <dig> in human epilepsy since mdr <dig> expression was found in both blood-brain barrier and parenchymal cells in epileptic brain  <cit> . this is based on the possibility that expression of mdr <dig> in glia may actually favor drug interactions with neuronal by reducing the accumulation of drug in the glial syncitium. conversely, parenchymal expression may shift concentrations in the extracellular and intracellular space or may mediate compartmentalization, and thus may reduce concentrations of antiepileptic drugs at their target sites. the fact that mdr <dig> may not be a crucial determinant for multiple drug resistance to antiepileptic drugs has been recently challenged in a number of reports  <cit> . other abc-transporters, most notably mrp <dig> and bcrp have also been localized to the blood-brain barrier, but similarly, direct evidence for the ability of these proteins to transport aeds in isolated systems has been lacking. because of the lack of information regarding the kinetic parameters of transport, the relative contributions of different abc transporters in mediating drug-resistant epilepsy remains unknown and a major impediment to development of novel targeted anti-epileptic agents.

we have recently described a novel non-abc mutispecific transporter, rlip <dig>  a multifunctional modular protein found ubiquitously from drosophila to humans  <cit> . it is encoded in humans on chromosome 18p <dig>  by a gene with  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. rlip <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein product of this gene, but splice-variants including a  <dig> kda peptide and longer  <dig> or  <dig> kda peptide, cytocentrin have been identified  <cit> . rlip <dig> was cloned as a ral-binding protein and predicted to be an effector involved in regulation of membrane plasticity, movement, and endocytosis  <cit> . rlip <dig> was identified as a highly active efflux mechanisms for removing glutathione-electrophile conjugate  from cells  <cit> . in addition to gs-e, the exceptionally broad substrate specificity of rlip <dig> extends to pgp substrates including anthracycline and vinca alkaloids, towards which it mediates resistance  <cit> . studies on proteomic screening of epileptic foci led to the identification of rlip <dig> as being frequently up-regulated. present studies were carried out to examine the role of rlip <dig> in aed transport in the blood-brain barrier.

RESULTS
rlip <dig> was expressed in all normal human tissues examined, more prominently in breast, heart, liver and erythrocytes, and less so in colon and brain parenchyma . significant expression was seen in malignant human cell lines including the pc- <dig> human prostate cancer and h <dig> human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. whereas rlip <dig> was barely detectable in normal brain parenchyma or vessels, blood vessels from epileptic patients has a markedly increased expression of rlip <dig> .

epileptic brain sections obtained from multiple drug resistant patients also revealed substantial differences compared to non-epileptic brain. by immunocytochemical analysis, we discovered widespread rlip <dig> expression in the cerebral vasculature from epileptic brain. we used double label immunofluorescence to reveal that rlip <dig> co-localized with the multidrug resistance transporter p-glycoprotein  but not with neun or gfap . however, while mdr <dig> was expressed in both parenchymal and endothelial cells  <cit> , rlip <dig> immunoreactivity was limited to the vasculature. no overlapping expression of rlip <dig> was observed in gfap positive astroglia  or neun positive neurons . by confocal analysis, rlip <dig> expression was found in capillary endothelial cells, penetrating pial vessels, and larger  vessels . in capillary endothelial cells, mdr <dig> expression was both lumenal  and abluminal , whereas rlip <dig> expression appeared to be predominantly lumenal and did not co-localize with gfap immunoreactivity . additional studies are needed to confirm this finding.

since the predominant endothelial localization of rlip <dig> suggested a strategic role in determining multiple drug resistance to antiepileptic drugs, we tested the ability of rlip <dig> to extrude the classic antiepileptic drug phe  <cit>  . this was examined in an isolated system consisting of asolectin-cholesterol artificial liposomes reconstituted in the presence of purified human rlip <dig>  <cit> . uptake of phe by liposomes with rlip <dig> or without  was examined in the presence or absence of atp. presence of atp in the transport medium increased the uptake of 14c-phe by rlip76-liposomes in a dose dependent fashion, whereas atp had no effect on uptake by control liposomes . we also determined that the intra-vesicular concentration of phe in control liposomes with or without atp and in rlip <dig> liposomes without atp were near the extra-vesicular drug-concentration , while rlip76-liposomes in the presence of atp had intra-vesicular phe concentrations of  <dig>  μm, demonstrating that in the presence of atp, rlip <dig> liposomes are able to concentrate phe against a gradient, the hallmark of active transport.

similar findings were obtained when investigating atp-dependent transport of another classic antiepileptic drug carbamazepine . while it is commonly believed that phe is an mdr <dig> substrate, uncertainty exists on cbz extrusion by mdr <dig>  <cit> . uptake of phe or cbz by inside-out vesicles was a time dependent process with kinetics consistent with a single compartment filling model , and the initial velocity of transport could be reasonably estimated by measuring uptake at  <dig> min after addition of atp. both antiepileptic drugs  were transported by rlip <dig> liposomes  initial velocity kinetics performed with varying either substrate , while holding the other constant showed that the km for phe and cbz was  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm respectively  and for atp  <dig>  mm  and  <dig>  mm  .

we then compared function and levels of expression of rlip <dig> in non-epileptic brain resected during cerebrovascular surgery unrelated to epileptic pathology or drug resistance vs. epileptic brain. expression of rlip <dig> was determined by western blot of tissue blocks and mrna analysis in isolated and cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells . we found that rlip <dig> mrna expression was greater in epileptic brain or endothelial cells isolated from the same tissue and that rlip <dig> protein levels correlated with phe transport activity measured in inside-out vesicles prepared from brain tissue .

functional rlip <dig> expression and aed transport activity were further studied in freshly collected human brain samples from epileptic patients. to determine the relative contribution of rlip <dig> toward total phe/cbz efflux capacity, we examined drug transport in the absence or presence of anti-rlip <dig> antibodies  <cit>  in crude membrane vesicles prepared from freshly collected human epileptic brain tissue . anti-rlip <dig> inhibited total transport of phe and cbz by  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> % respectively . when we repeated the same experiments with anti-mdr <dig> antibodies, we found inhibition by  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig>   %; exposure to both antibodies resulted in a cumulative inhibition. interestingly, the amount of phe extrusion by mdr <dig> determined by antibody-mediated inactivation was comparable to that described in a previous study after pharmacological blockade by xr <dig>  a specific mdr <dig> blocker  <cit> . these findings indicated that rlip <dig> is the predominant aed transporter in brain tissue.

for the above experiments, we directly obtained vesicles from acutely isolated cortical samples. under these conditions, culture artifacts are avoided but the individual contribution of a given cell type remains undetectable. to determine the cell type involved in the process of rlip76-mediated phe extrusion we compared 14c-phe transport in vesicles obtained from endothelial cells and astrocytes isolated and cultured from either control  or epileptic  brain  <cit>  . phe transport was significantly higher in endothelial cells as compared to astrocytes, and greater in both cell types from epileptic tissues. these data are in agreement with the immunocytochemical results showing predominant expression of rlip <dig> in human epileptic endothelial cells and not brain parenchymal cells.

phe has been described as an mdr <dig> substrate based on experiments performed on knock out mice lacking pgp  <cit> . we performed experiments in rlip76+/+ and rlip76-/- c57b mice injected i.p. with phe . at both doses, brain phe levels were higher in rlip76-/- mice as compared with rlip76+/+ . however, this was more prominent at the  <dig> mg/kg level. a statistically significant increase in phe accumulation in brain was observed at both concentrations . rlip76-/- mice were characterized by higher levels of phe in both brain and serum compared with the wild-type, consistent with a role of rlip <dig> in renal excretion of phe . to account for this, a group of wild-type animals was injected with elevated  doses of phe to achieve serum levels comparable to those seen in knock out animals injected with much lower quantities . rlip76-/- mice demonstrated greater neurotoxicity after administration of phe; side effects in these animals included lethargy and status-epilepticus .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results show that rlip <dig> is an important phe and cbz transporter at the human blood brain barrier, and its expression is increased in the bbb from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. rlip <dig> fulfilled many of the predicted properties for a mediator of cns pharmacoresistance, including: 1) presence at the anatomical interface between brain and blood; 2) transport of the antiepileptic drugs phe and cbz; 3) functional expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells but not in parenchymal glia or neurons; and 4) increased cns accumulation of phe in rlip76-/- mice. these results also demonstrate for the first time that the putative mediator of multiple drug resistance in epilepsy, mdr <dig>  <cit> , is in fact overshadowed in potency by another atp-dependent transporter. our results are also in accord with previous reports which questioned the relevance of mdr <dig> as a multiple drug resistance mechanism, while rather suggesting a role in neuroglial protection  <cit> . we also confirmed that cbz is a poor mdr <dig> substrate  <cit> .

several important questions remain unanswered. for example, is the widespread distribution of mdr <dig>  mrps  and rlip <dig> in epileptic brain also linked to the pathology itself? are these transporters expressed as a response to a hostile environment or are they regulated exclusively by chemotherapy? both mdr <dig> and mrp are involved in cell survival, and recent evidence by this laboratory  <cit>  have shown that apoptotic mechanisms are lacking in epileptic brain. interestingly, the original proposed role for rlip <dig> was indeed that of a molecule involved in detoxification or protection of cells living in hostile environments  <cit> . more recently, yadav et al. have confirmed a dual role for rlip <dig>  consisting of anti-apoptotic and drug resistance functions  <cit> . thus, purely on the bases of overall function, mdr <dig> and rlip <dig> are indistinguishable. it is possible that multiple drug resistance molecules, in addition to cooperating in drug extrusion, also play a role in the control of cellular homeostasis.

in conclusion, we report a novel, non-abc transporter mediated mechanism of antiepileptic drug resistance that may synergistically cooperate with mdr <dig>  the relative contribution of each transporter as determined in vitro and ex situ suggests a predominant role for rlip <dig>  our results are consistent with a predominant role of the blood-brain barrier in determining multiple drug resistance to antiepileptic drugs.
