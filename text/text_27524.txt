BACKGROUND
the anther is the male reproductive organ in flowering plants and is composed of both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues. the reproductive tissue originates as a mass of primary sporogenous cells which are produced from the division of archesporial cells in the l <dig> layer of anther primordia. these cells divide mitotically to give rise to the microspore mother cells , that undergo meiosis to produce haploid tetrads of microspores  <cit> . this reductional division assures genetic diversity in sexual reproduction via pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes. cytologically, there are more commonalities than differences between the processes of mitosis and meiosis, e.g., condensation of chromosomes, their distinctive alignment at metaphase, followed by separation of sister chromatids/homologous chromosomes at anaphase, grouping of two nucleoids at telophase, and finally cytokinesis that physically partitions the nucleo-cytoplasmic compartments. besides these similarities, there are a few vital dissimilarities that distinguish these two processes, including pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes during meiosis . this is followed by segregation of homologues and non-sister chromatids by unipolar attachment of sister kinetochores to spindles, during the first meiotic division. in the last decade, a number of cell division components involved in chromosome condensation, sister chromatid/homologous chromosome cohesion, kinetochore-spindle attachment/alignment, and cytokinesis have been identified. however, we still know very little about the regulatory networks that control the functioning of such components in a mitosis- or meiosis-specific manner.

unlike in animals, haploid sperm are not produced directly after meiosis in plants. instead, the haploid microspores are freed from the tetrad by the action of callase, and then divide mitotically twice to produce a three-celled functional male gametophyte known as pollen. the first mitosis is asymmetric which results in two cells of different sizes and with dissimilar fates. the larger vegetative cell occupies most of the pollen space and does not divide further but later, at the time of germination, forms the pollen tube. the smaller generative cell undergoes one more round of mitotic division  to produce two sperm cells. one of the sperm cells fertilizes the egg cell in the female gametophyte to form the zygote and the other fuses with the two polar nuclei to form the triploid endosperm. development and release of mature pollen is dependent on the elaborate coordination of many genes expressed in both non-reproductive as well as reproductive cell layers of the anther. thus, the anther is a multicellular organ that undergoes complex processes such as cell fate determination  <cit> , cell differentiation, reductional division  <cit>  and cell-cell communication  <cit> .

our understanding of the genes that regulate developmental aspects of the anther is largely based on information gathered by gene function knockdown approaches, either by mutagenesis or rna interference . most of the pioneering research has been done in arabidopsis but at the same time many genes have also been identified and characterized in rice revealing gene function deviations or novel gene functions . for example, the characterization of an arabidopsis excess microsporocytes  <dig>  orthologue in rice  and subsequent delineation of its interaction with the tapetum determinant  <dig>  rice orthologue , revealed its novel function in restricting the number of sporogenous cells in the ovule as well as in the anthers  <cit> .

although the gene knockout/knockdown approach  can enable classification of a particular gene in context of a biological phenomenon, these methods do not provide detailed information about the other components of the regulatory circuitry that are positioned either upstream or downstream in the hierarchy. building a regulatory network around this nucleation point is often a difficult task that involves a combination of protein-protein, dna-protein and mutant analysis strategies. however, analysis of transcriptome level perturbations in developmentally or physiologically distinct states may help in the segregation of various molecular contributors into co-expression groups, which could be further analyzed for specific interactions  <cit> . microarray-based studies carried out in arabidopsis  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  have revealed the complexity of gene expression during stages of anther development by use of high density microarrays. honys and twell  <cit>  carried out transcriptome analysis of male gametophyte development in arabidopsis where they identified and categorized microspore-expressed genes on the basis of co-expression profiles. of particular note is the study conducted by crismani and co-workers  <cit> , where these authors used wheat affymetrix genechip to monitor the expression dynamics across seven stages of anther development in the complex polyploid, bread wheat. more recently, in rice, distinguishable differences between the tapetum and male gametophyte transcriptomes have been ascertained by using laser micro-dissected cells of specific tissue types  <cit> . collectively, all these studies highlight the contrast of expression between gametophytic and sporophytic tissues. however, because of the lack of comparison with other tissue/cell-types most of these studies fall short of identifying genes that express specifically in these cell types and, therefore, would almost certainly be playing significant regulatory roles in controlling various aspects that are unique to male gametophyte development.

an objective of the current study was to identify genes that exhibit anther stage-specific expression patterns. to achieve this we performed whole genome microarray analysis on rice anthers isolated at pre-meiotic , meiotic , single-celled microspore , and tri-nucleate pollen  stages of development. since whole anthers were used in this study, we expected the data to include contributions from all cell types. we performed differential expression analysis to identify genes regulating precise developmental events during anther development. by including transcriptomic data of four vegetative and seed developmental stages/tissue types in the differential expression analysis, we have attempted to identify and segregate expression profiles specifically  relevant to the events related to male gametophyte development. these analyses have identified genes that express specifically in pma, ma, scp and tpa. furthermore, the data have also been analyzed for the expression specificities of known meiosis-related genes and those contributing to sperm cell transcriptomes in other systems. our data therefore provides a firm foundation for future investigations centered on delineating the molecular networks of male meiosis, early gametophyte development and sperm cell differentiation in rice.

methods
tissue collection and rna extraction
wild type rice  was transplanted in fields in mid-june,  <dig>  temperature ranged from 35-40°cmax and 25-29°cmin. a constant water supply was available throughout the growing period. tissue was harvested at different stages of anther development from about  <dig> to  <dig> days after transplant. florets at various stages of development were dissected using a leica mz  <dig>   dissecting microscope to collect anthers. anther squashes were prepared from one representative anther in each floret, stained with dapi, and observed under a fluorescence microscope  to confirm the developmental stage according to raghvan  <cit> . anthers isolated from 8- <dig> plants were bulked into three biological replicates.

after collection and staging into separate groups containing four developmentally distinct stages , anthers were placed in trizol reagent  and kept at -70°c until rna isolation. high quality rna, assessed by a bio-analyzer , was used for hybridization experiments with the 57k rice genome array .

note: panicle, floret and anther length indexing is standardized only for ir <dig> cultivar of oryza sativa subsp. indica, and may vary in different cultivars of rice

microarray experiments
a total of  <dig> μg of total rna isolated from anthers was amplified and labeled using a one-cycle target labeling kit . target preparation, hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of the chips were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. genechip® operating software  <dig> . <dig>  was used for washing and staining of the chips in a fluidics station  <dig>  and scanned with a scanner  <dig> . three biological replicates processed for each stage with overall correlation co-efficient values of more than  <dig>  were further used for the final data analysis, which underlines the high reproducibility and reliability of the microarray data.

microarray data analysis
cel files for four anther development stages generated by gcos were transferred to arrayassist ver.  <dig>   microarray data analysis software for analyses. a combined project was made where cel files of the four anther stages, as well as those for mature leaf, y-leaf, root, 7-day-old seedling, shoot apical meristem  and five stages of seed development , have been deposited to the gene expression omnibus .

the rice affymetrix genechip® contains  <dig>  probe-sets, however, not all of the probe-sets correspond to annotated genes, and in some instances more than one probe-set corresponds to annotated genes. therefore, in order to identify the unique probe-sets that correspond to annotated genes, the msu rice pseudomolecule  version  <dig>  kome  and ncbi  databases were used, with the probe-set list manually curated. consequently, a total of  <dig>  probe-sets were identified as unique non-redundant probe-set ids  related genes, redundant probe-sets and probe-sets without a corresponding locus in the databases mentioned above). all subsequent expression analysis was carried out on this reduced dataset. the mas <dig> algorithm was applied  to identify genes that could be classified as expressed or non-expressed. 66% present calls in a triplicate  dataset were kept as minimum criteria for a gene being 'expressed' or otherwise 'non-expressed'. the microarray data was normalized using the gc-rma algorithm followed by log <dig> transformation. to identify differentially expressed genes, one-way analysis of variance  was performed on the four anther development stages with the benjamini hochberg correction  <cit> . further, a stringent statistical criterion of at least a 2-fold change at a p-value ≤ <dig>  was used for gene selection. cluster analysis was performed using the k-means clustering algorithm of arrayassist . all the heat-maps were made using gc-rma log transformed sample averages.

expression values of probe-sets of magnoporthe genes present on the chip were used as a criterion to define "absent" genes  since their signal value should represent the background signal. average of the median for those genes plus  <dig> i.e.,  <dig> gc-rma value was put as the upper limit for a gene to be called 'absent'. annotations for functional alignment of genes were retrieved from osa <dig> rice genome annotation project release  <dig> .

identification of putative orthologues in rice
we have previously described the identification of putative rice orthologues of meiotic genes  <cit> . briefly, the sequences of saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis thaliana genes involved in double strand break  formation, recombination, synaptonemal complex assembly, chromosome pairing and dna mismatch repair were used as queries for tblastx analysis against all green plants at the institute for genomic research's  plant transcript assembly  database. a significance value of >e- <dig> from the tblastx analysis was used to identify putative orthologues in wheat, rice and barley. the rice ta ids for meiotic gene orthologues  <cit>  were used to identify the corresponding rice osa <dig> loci  release  <dig> ; http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu) and their respective affymetrix probe-sets, which were used for expression analysis. for the identification of sperm-expressed genes, cdna and est sequences of arabidopsis, maize and lily were downloaded from tair  and ncbi . these sequences were used as queries for blastx against a local database made with the osa <dig> release  <dig>  rice proteins using bioedit software , with a significance value of > e- <dig> used for identifying rice orthologues .

real-time quantitative pcr 
cdna for the real-time reactions were synthesized using the same rna samples that were used for microarrays. real-time pcr primer designing, reactions and calculations were carried out as described previously  <cit> . primers used in the experiment are listed in additional file  <dig> 

in situ hybridizations
florets were fixed in faa  for  <dig> hours at 4°c and then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series followed by a tertiary butanol series, before placing in paraplast plus . paraplast embedded florets were sectioned by using a leica rm <dig> rotary microtome producing  <dig> μm thick sections that were placed on poly-l-lysine coated slides . approximately  <dig> bp sequences from the genes loc_os04g <dig> and loc_os01g <dig>  were amplified using primers  and , respectively. these cloned products were then ligated into the pgemt-easy vector . the clones were linearized with sal i and nco i enzymes for in vitro transcription of digoxinin labeled rna probes with t <dig> and sp <dig> rna polymerase, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions . the in situ pre-treatment and hybridization steps were essentially carried out as described  <cit> . immunological detection was carried out using the roche dig detection kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. sections were mounted in dpx mounting medium and observed under the microscope .

RESULTS
development-dependent changes in the anther transcriptome
transcriptome profiling of anther development required isolation of anthers at landmark stages of development, i.e., pre-meiosis , meiosis , immediately after meiosis where single-celled microspores are released from tetrads  and mature anthers with tri-nucleate pollen  just prior to dehiscence. for this, the rice florets were initially broadly classified on the basis of their size and then one anther from each floret was microscopically examined to confirm the stage of male gametophyte development by staining with dapi before staging the rest into one of the four classes specified above . microarray data from the three replicates of each stage exhibited correlation co-efficients of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . scatter plot analysis was performed to analyze the extent of transcriptome level variations between the four anther stages . interestingly, pma, ma and scp showed high correlation values between  <dig> - <dig> , however, tpa was found to be markedly different in its transcript constitution from the other stages of anther development, with correlation co-efficients ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> . this difference was also reflected in the number of differentially  regulated genes . to determine the extent of transcriptome level changes that are required for anthers to differentiate from the undifferentiated meristematic cells, the pma transcriptome was compared with that of the shoot apical meristem . the sam and pma showed significant correlation , which gradually declined with the progression of anther development to  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

the oligonucleotide probes on the rice affymetrix genome array represent  <dig>  unique genes including  <dig>  gene loci mapped in msu rice genome annotation release  <dig> and  <dig>  unique, but unmapped, cdna/ests . this represents  <dig> % of the latest estimates of  <dig>  non-te-related protein-coding genes on the rice pseudomolecules. to define the extent of the anther transcriptome, the expressed genes were differentiated from the non-expressed genes . consequently,  <dig>  genes were identified as expressed in at least one stage of anther development . mas <dig> detection calls and their p-values are given in additional file  <dig>  the ma and scp stages were found to express the maximum number of genes, i.e.,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. number of genes specifically present amongst anthers was identified as those where expression in all the other anther stages except one had gc-rma expression value less than  <dig> . the tpa transcriptome was the smallest with  <dig>  expressed genes but it represented the most diverse transcriptome with the largest proportion  of genes expressed specifically at this developmental stage amongst anthers. the proportion of specifically expressed genes was found to be  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in scp, ma and pma, respectively.

the cumulative anther transcriptome was compared with the previously generated transcriptomes of root, leaf and five stages of seed development of the same rice cultivar  <cit>  to identify the extent of overlap between various transcriptomes . in total,  <dig>  genes express in all the stages analyzed, suggesting their involvement in housekeeping functions or general metabolism. this analysis also highlighted that anthers have the largest  and the most diverse transcriptome of all the stages analyzed, as expression of  <dig>   genes was unique to anthers. in comparison, the numbers of uniquely expressed genes in roots, leaves and seeds were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. besides identifying  <dig>  commonly expressed genes between all four developmental stages, the anther transcriptome shared maximum similarity to that of the seed transcriptome with  <dig>  commonly expressed genes in anther and seed stages. however, a much lower level of similarity between the anther and root , and anther and leaf  transcriptomes was observed.

co-regulated clusters of differentially expressed genes
to identify genes with similar expression profiles during anther development, the normalized expression data was subjected to one-way anova that resulted in the selection of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes at a p-value ≤ <dig> . using a cut-off of 2-fold change in expression in any stage of anther development further filtered these genes to  <dig>  . using k-means clustering, these genes could be clustered into  <dig> major groups, which were further categorized into sub-groups depending on the amplitude of expression . clusters  <dig> to  <dig> consisted of  <dig>   differentially expressed genes expressing in all stages of anther development. of these, only one gene was found to be specific to anther stages. genes in these clusters either showed up  or down regulation  in tpa, while in other stages the difference in expression of these genes is not as significant. in contrast, the  <dig>  genes in cluster  <dig> showed high expression in pma, ma and scp;  <dig>  genes in cluster  <dig> were activated specifically in scp, while clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  exhibited ma- and tpa-preferential expression profiles, respectively.

for the identification of specifically expressed genes during anther development, five vegetative stages  and five stages of seed development  were compared with anther stages. from the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes , those with gc-rma normalized signal values less than or equal to  <dig> in vegetative and seed stages were filtered out . genes obtained were further filtered by identifying those with at least a 2-fold higher signal value in any of the anther stages than the highest value in the vegetative or seed stages . after such stringent filtering  <dig>  anther-specific genes were identified . forty-five percent  of them were only specifically expressed in tpa, further emphasizing the distinctness of this stage. scp and ma have only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the specifically expressing genes respectively, while pma has a low share of stage specificity with  <dig> % representation. notably, those specifically expressed in pma have lower expression compared to other anther stages.

percentages of anther specific genes were calculated for each of the k-means clusters . interestingly, expression of  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  genes in clusters  <dig> to  <dig> was found to be specific to anthers. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were specific to meiotic anthers,  <dig>  to anthers at the scp stage, while the largest group was expressed specifically at the tpa stage  .

the differentially expressed genes in each of the  <dig> clusters were assigned to  <dig> functional categories and those that could not be affiliated to any of these categories or that have not been annotated as yet were categorized as 'others' . cluster-wise over representation of the number of genes by 20%  of their overall percentage in individual functional categories has been highlighted to facilitate better visual interpretation of the data . genes involved in protein metabolism, involving folding, sorting and degradation , signal transduction  and transcription factors  constitute three major functional categories of differentially expressed genes during anther development. clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which exhibited down-regulatory trends from sam to tpa , were dominated generally by transcription factor, chromatin remodeling, rna metabolism, translation- and cell cycle-related genes. expression profiles in clusters 6b and  <dig>  showing up-regulation in ma and scp followed by down-regulation in tpa, coincide with the pattern of tapetum development. coincidently, the genes exhibiting these profiles were found to have over-representation of those involved in carbohydrate, energy and lipid metabolism, along with those involved in transporter activities and vesicular trafficking. cluster  <dig>  which represents tpa specific expression profiles, had an over-representation of genes involved in cell structure, secondary metabolism, transporter activity and signal transduction.

the total representation of genes  of three major functional categories  is shown in bold & underlined text. over-representation of genes in each functional category by more than 20% of their overall representation in individual clusters is highlighted with bold and italicized letters.

validation of specific expression profiles by q-pcr and in situ hybridizations
to validate the microarray data, eight genes showing specific expression in one or more stages of anther development were selected for real-time/quantitative pcr analysis . these include: one gene from cluster 3b exhibiting pma specific expression; two genes from cluster 7a and one gene from cluster 7b with high and low expression, respectively, in ma and scp; two from cluster 8a with ma preferential expression; and two genes from cluster 10a with expression mainly in the tpa. two of the selected genes have been previously characterized and their reported expression profiles also matched with our analysis . overall gene expression as identified by the microarray experiments, exhibited a high degree of similarity with that obtained from the q-pcr analyses with a correlation co-efficient  greater than  <dig> , thereby indicating the reliability and robustness of the microarray data.

further, we validated our microarray expression results by doing in situ hybridization of two of the genes already validated by q-pcr . the transcripts from loc_os04g <dig>  which codes for an argonaute protein, were found to localize in the meiocytes as well as wall layers of meiotic anthers. later in development , the expression was found to be restricted to the tapetum, microspores and vascular tissue in the connective. loc_os01g <dig>  coding for a lem- <dig> family protein, exhibited expression in the tapetal layer of anthers at tri-nucleate stage with no expression in the pollen grains. the expression of both the genes was restricted to anthers as no expression was seen in lemma and palea . we also scanned the literature for in situ experiments where we could correlate our anther-specific or anther-preferential expression with that reported previously. a summary of expression domains of six such genes coding for osc <dig>  <cit> , osmsp <dig>  <cit> , osrad21- <dig>  <cit> , osmel <dig>  <cit> , pair <dig>  <cit>  and tdr  <cit>  and their correlation with the microarray expression profiles obtained from our dataset is shown in figure 5b. the in situ expression patterns of two genes analyzed here and the six previously reported, show good correlation with our microarray based profiles and subsequent differential expression analysis.

developmental stage-wise activation/up-regulation of genes
as anther development progresses from pma to tpa, a number of processes are accomplished in a sequential manner. by comparing gene expression between two adjacent stages of anther development, we aimed to identify the molecular components involved in switching from one phase of development to the next. the results of this comparative analysis where differences in expression between sam:pma, pma:ma, ma:scp, and scp:tpa stages were analyzed by setting the criteria of 2-fold change at a p-value ≤ <dig>  are shown in figure 6a. only a small proportion of genes , were found to be differentially activated  or down-regulated  in pma when compared to sam. however the number of differentially expressed genes steadily increased to  <dig>  in ma,  <dig>  in scp and  <dig>  in tpa in relation to their respective previous stage of development. a greater number of genes were up-regulated in comparison to those down-regulated in pma and ma, however, this trend reversed in scp and tpa where a larger proportion of genes showed down-regulation . this finding might point towards a major post-meiotic switching of gene expression from the sporophytic to the gametophytic mode.

the stage-wise up-regulated genes during progression of anther development were further mined for those that were specifically activated in a particular stage . for this, specific genes with no detectable expression in any previous anther stage were considered as specifically activated/triggered. interestingly, only  <dig> genes  were found to be triggered in pma. the percentage of specifically activated genes ranged between  <dig> to 16% of the total up-regulated genes in ma, scp and tpa vis-à-vis their respective previous stage of development, with the number in the respective stages being  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  functional association of stage-wise activated and  <dig> fold up-regulated genes based on gene ontology  annotations highlighted the molecular processes/components involved . major perturbations in transcript abundance were observed in genes coding for transcription factors, signal transduction and cell structure components, catalytic activity and those involved in the function of protein folding, sorting and degradation. a significant number  of genes coding for signal transduction components were specifically activated in tpa, which may contribute to the pollen-specific transcriptome involved in pollen-pistil interactions and pollen tube growth. the largest numbers of genes involved in protein metabolism were triggered in the scp stage, which coincided with the most active phase of tapetal cells and their degeneration. out of the  <dig> cell structure related genes up regulated in tpa,  <dig> were specifically triggered at this stage that comprises  <dig> % of the tpa triggered genes. this suggests most of the up-regulated cytoskeletal genes may have a tpa specific function; most likely in pollen germination.

expression dynamics of meiosis-related genes
the functional conservation of meiosis between eukaryotes can be exploited to identify new candidates for meiotic regulation in rice. we have previously compiled a database of yeast and arabidopsis genes involved in meiosis, and identified putative orthologues in the rice, wheat, and barley genomes  <cit> . the expression of the rice homologues, identified by tblastx, showed that several of these have specific expression/significant up-regulation in anthers, though the majority were also expressed in other tissues/stages of development . four of the five annotated cohesin genes showed similar expression levels in most tissues, but among these smc <dig> and scc <dig> had reduced expression in roots and tpa. the double strand break linked genes spo11- <dig> and spo11- <dig>  though expressed at relatively lower levels, showed specifically higher transcript accumulation in pma, ma and tpa. some components of the mismatch repair machinery , rad <dig> epistasis group  and those involved in recombination/synapsis  also exhibited higher transcript accumulation in stages of anther development. the yeast meiosis-related genes described above were also analyzed for their expression profiles during vegetative, pre-meiotic and stages after induction of meiosis in yeast , utilizing the microarray data  as described  <cit> . of  <dig> genes analyzed,  <dig> showed uniform expression in vegetative as well as sporulation stages, while the remaining  <dig> genes were up regulated by at least two folds during meiosis in yeast . most of the rice orthologues of meiosis-related yeast genes were also found to show enhanced transcript accumulation in anther stages.

functions for only a few meiosis-related genes, selected on the basis of homology to known genes in other systems or meiosis-affecting mutant phenotypes, have been validated in rice. these genes, with the exception of atrck, exhibit a characteristic meiotic anther specific expression profile . our co-expression analysis revealed two cluster  exhibiting meiotic anther preferential expression profiles . included in this list are zep <dig>  <cit> , dmc <dig>  <cit> and mel <dig>  <cit>  which have been implicated in transition from mitotic to meiotic cell division and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. the genes in this cluster, therefore, could be a valuable resource for mining other components of meiotic machinery and meiosis related regulatory networks.

proportion of putative sperm cell expressed genes in the tpa transcriptome
with the aim of identifying genes contributing to sperm cell transcriptome in rice, we performed a comparative analysis of arabidopsis, maize and lily sperm cell/generative cell expressed genes with the tpa transcriptome  <cit> . we then complemented this analysis by overlaying information on genes with specific expression in rice anthers in order to determine sperm cell-specific genes from the tpa transcriptome. blastx analysis identified rice homologues for  <dig> genes from the maize sperm cell,  <dig>  from the arabidopsis sperm cell, and  <dig> from the lily generative cell transcriptome that were represented on the rice genome array . hobo et al.,  <cit>  identified  <dig>  anther-expressed genes in rice and classified them into  <dig> clusters based on co-expression profiles; five of which included genes with expression in rice bi-cellular and tri-cellular microspores. the  <dig>  genes in these five clusters were also included in this analysis . rice homologues of  <dig> % maize,  <dig> % lily and  <dig> % arabidopsis germline-expressed genes were represented in the rice tpa transcriptome. even the sperm-cell transcriptome datasets obtained from maize and arabidopsis that represent two evolutionary diverse plant groups , had proportional representation in the rice tpa transcriptome . however, when the maize and arabidopsis sperm cell transcriptomes were compared with each other, only  <dig> genes were found to be common, amounting to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their respective transcriptomes . in all,  <dig>  rice homologues of sperm cell expressed genes in other systems were identified which would comprise the putative sperm cell transcriptome of rice .

discussion
the microarray data presented here forms a robust platform for the studies on developmental and molecular aspects of male gametophyte development in rice and in cereals at large. a high degree of correlation obtained between the three biological replicates for all stages investigated underlines the reproducibility and strength of the data, which has also been validated by q-pcr and in-situ hybridization analyses. the mas  <dig>  based present calls representing the size of the transcriptomes  examined, was found to be significantly higher in comparison to a recent sequencing-by-synthesis based analysis of rice anther transcriptomes in which about  <dig> -  <dig> distinct transcripts were detected in individual stages of anther development  <cit> . on the other hand it was much less when compared to another recent study of the rice anther transcriptome using the same platform   <cit>  in which  <dig>  -  <dig>  probe-sets were reported. the difference could have resulted from the fact that we have used a more refined sub-set of genes where the redundant probe-set ids and genes coding for transposable elements  were removed. the size of maize anther transcriptomes , however, was found to have a comparable number of transcripts to those found in our analysis  <cit> . comparison of the anther transcriptomes revealed a high correlation between sam, pma, ma and scp stages, indicating that there are subtle differences in expression across these three stages. the high similarity observed between sam and pma suggests that changes in the expression of very few genes are required to trigger anther development in rice. most of the differentially expressed genes identified were found to be regulatory in nature, therefore, although these changes are few in number they can potentially initiate a chain of events in subsequent stages to influence expression of many downstream genes. it would seem that pma is therefore a transitory phase, where the decision to undergo meiosis is taken in some specialized cells. pma and ma represent very early stages of anther development in which there is relatively high representation of sporophytic tissue in comparison to the gametophytic tissue, with most of the transcriptome changes corresponding to sporogenous tissue and the developing tapetum. tpa, however, contains a relatively higher cellular mass that represents mature gametophytic tissue. in the current study, we clearly show marked differences in its transcript constitution from the rest of the anther transcriptomes investigated. the tpa stage is also characterized by the smallest and the most diverse transcriptome of the four stages analyzed. this could be by virtue of the distinctive transcriptomes of the male gametophyte and sperm cells  <cit>  and down-regulation of a large number of genes that might not be required for the development of the gametophyte  <cit> .

comparison of our data with the recently published transcriptome of haploid male gametophyte development  <cit>  substantiates our staging of anther development. of the  <dig> unique probe-sets enriched in tricellular pollen  as identified by wei and coworkers  <cit>   <dig>  were expressed in tpa. also of the  <dig> uni-nucleate microspore  enriched probe-sets,  <dig>  were expressed in scp.

in the present study, we have grouped differentially expressed genes into  <dig> co-expression groups. the information gathered from frequently co-expressed genes across multiple datasets and across different organisms has previously been used to verify gene interaction patterns and also to predict novel gene interaction networks  <cit> . a large number of genes  found in these co-expression groups have not even been annotated and even fewer of those that are annotated have been validated for their role in anther development. therefore, identification of genes in these co-expression clusters pave the way for more focused investigations leading to a better understanding of gene regulatory networks.

the list of specifically activated transcription factors in pma included four transcription factors . also, eleven genes  belonging to the mads-box family were up regulated by  <dig> folds in pma with respect to sam, which were also shown to be part of the pollen mother cell preferential transcriptome . some of these mads box genes have also been implicated in anther development  <cit> . four members of the yabby gene family were found to be specifically down regulated in pma in comparison to sam. however, in the ma, the nam and ap <dig> class of genes dominated the list of differentially expressed transcription factors. while eight nam and three ap <dig> family genes were up regulated in ma, eight ap <dig> genes were down regulated . in scp, besides a shuffling in the pool of transcription factors, down-regulation of the translation machinery was observed with more than  <dig> translation-related genes significantly affected by more than two folds. most of these genes continued with the downward trend in tpa as well. in concurrence with previous observations from several groups  <cit>  most of the down-regulated genes code for ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. there were also genes coding for lsm  domain containing and rna recognition motif proteins that are known for their involvement in pre-mrna processing  <cit> .

a major proportion of the differentially expressed signal transduction components included those involved in calcium-mediated signaling, e.g. calcium dependent protein kinases, caleosins and other proteins containing c <dig> domain and ef hands. genes involved in secondary metabolism  showed marked up-regulation in ma and scp. during meiosis and the single-celled microspore stage, tapetal cells are most active and are known to be involved in the synthesis of flavonoids and other secondary metabolites that eventually find their way to developing microspores  <cit> , therefore, up-regulation of secondary metabolism related genes could in fact be related to tapetum development. though not significant in number, genes involved in chromatin remodeling were also differentially expressed during progression of anther development. in addition, genes expressed in response to various abiotic stresses e.g., those coding for late embryogenesis abundant  proteins, dehydrins, and other senescence-associated proteins showed stage-specific differential expression, emphasizing that there may be parallels between the molecular mechanisms involved in reproductive development and stress .

another interesting observation was that the anther transcriptome showed a high level of similarity with the seed transcriptome profile, when compared with other stages/tissues. the similarities in the two organs could be due to biochemical processes that are common to them. both anthers and seeds are metabolically active tissues that exhibit high rates of cell division and both act as sinks for sugar derivatives, which are converted to starch at a rapid rate in these tissues. furthermore, we have recently analyzed the similarities between reproductive developmental stages and dehydration stress in rice  <cit> , where the findings indicate a high degree of overlap between genes that show differential expression during mature stages of panicle development, natural desiccation of seeds and plants exposed to dehydration stress. the findings in the present analysis highlight that both anthers and seeds could be utilizing similar regulatory networks for accumulation of starch, as they enter a phase of biological desiccation.

gene regulation by means of rna interference has been shown to play a vital role in anther development  <cit> . reports have also shown the presence of functional mirna in late stages of anther development  <cit> . our data has also revealed up-regulation of genes coding for argonautes and other proteins with paz and piwi domains in pre-meiotic and meiotic anthers in a stage preferential manner, suggesting that a different subset of rnai machinery might be activated in reproductive tissues especially during early anther development. a rice pre-meiosis-specific argonaute gene osmel <dig>  that has recently been implicated in male meiosis,  <cit>  was shortlisted in our analysis and identified as being pma-specific. it might therefore be interesting to explore the function of other similar components, determining whether there is reproduction-specific rnai machinery.

towards understanding expression dynamics of the meiome
meiosis has long been the subject of research with pioneering investigation in yeast   <cit> . in flowering plants, identification of many meiotic mutants in arabidopsis, rice and maize has led to functional characterization of close to fifty plant meiotic genes, that has substantially added to our current understanding of genes involved in plant meiosis  <cit> . the meiosis related genes characterized in rice include pair <dig>   <cit> , pair <dig>   <cit> , osrad21- <dig>   <cit> , osdmc <dig>   <cit> , pair <dig>  <cit> , osmel <dig>  <cit> , ossds  and osrck   <cit> . all these genes except pair <dig>  pair <dig> and osmel <dig> were identified due to their homology to meiosis-related genes in yeast or arabidopsis. however unlike in yeast and mammalian systems, we are still far from constituting the plant meiome.

our data shows that a large majority of rice meiosis homologues  do not express in a meiosis-specific manner. for example, atahp <dig>  <cit>  is known to be involved in meiosis but it is expressed in other vegetative tissues as well. likewise atrad <dig> is expressed in other stages but it has been shown to be essential for the progression of normal meiosis  <cit> . it could either mean that a greater proportion of genes involved in meiosis play a role in other cellular functions as well or that other genes may have taken up meiosis-specific functions in plants. some meiotic genes have been shown to be plant-specific . recently, tang and coworkers  <cit>  carried out global expression profiling of laser-captured pollen mother cells  in rice using the 44k agilent array. by comparing the expression of pmc expressed genes to those expressed in seedlings and tricellular pollen they could identify  <dig>  pmc-preferential genes. these pmc preferentially expressed genes contained many known meiotic genes, including osspo11- <dig>  <cit> , pair <dig>  <cit> , pair <dig>  <cit> , pair <dig>  <cit> , osdmc <dig>  <cit> , osmel <dig>  <cit> , osrad21- <dig>  <cit> , ossds  <cit> , and zep <dig>  <cit> . since  <dig> of the  <dig> pmc-preferential genes were represented in our data set  we decided to analyze the expression profiles of these genes in all four stages of anthers . interestingly, of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> expressed both in pre-meiotic  and meiotic anthers   and  <dig> of these expressed in sam as well, albeit at relatively lower levels. however, when this data set of  <dig> genes was parsed through our data set of anther-specific genes, we could identify only  <dig> genes that were expressed in pma and ma . furthermore, most of the  <dig> genes that were expressed in both pma and ma were also expressed at significant levels in other stages of anther development . these observations strengthen our hypothesis that the expression for the majority of meiosis-related genes is not restricted to cells undergoing meiosis and that they may participate in functions other than meiosis or that other genes may have taken up meiosis-specific functions in plants. therefore, the  <dig> genes constituting the meiotic anther specific expression profile  in this study should serve as a valuable resource for mining, the as yet unidentified, components of the meiotic machinery and associated regulatory networks in rice.

differential expression analysis involving comparison of adjacent stages revealed an interesting pattern showing a steady and significant increase in the number of genes activating in post-meiotic stages . in these stages a total of  <dig>  transcripts were up regulated in comparison to  <dig>  in pma and ma combined. additionally, the post-meiotic stages of scp and tpa contained a significantly larger proportion of genes down regulated  when compared to the earlier stages of pma and ma . a similar trend of a large number of genes getting transcriptionally activated and deactivated in post-meiotic anthers was also observed in maize  <cit> . in maize,  <dig> genes were up regulated while  <dig> were down regulated in post-meiotic stages of anther development. we detected orthologues for  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, in our data set, and of these  <dig>  and  <dig>  exhibited similar expression profiles in rice. incidentally, a large percentage of the down-regulated genes in both rice and maize anthers are those that are expressed at significant levels  , which suggests that meiosis may act as a two-way molecular switch that activates a large number of gametophytic genes, and at the same time, shuts down the sporophytic machinery that is presumably not necessary for male gametophyte development.

sperm cell transcriptome
the transcriptomes of pollen and sperm cells have been reported to be smaller than and distinct from those of vegetative tissues  <cit> . by comparing known sperm cell transcriptomes with the tpa transcriptome, we have attempted to identify the constitution of the rice sperm cell transcript pool. we show that a large proportion of transcripts constituting the arabidopsis sperm cell , maize sperm cell  and the lilly generative cell  transcriptomes were represented in the rice tpa transcriptome, suggesting a high degree of similarity between sperm cell transcriptomes of monocot and dicot plants. categorization of tpa activated and up-regulated genes into go functional groups  indicates that genes encoding signal transduction components, cell structure components, transporters, transcription factors and stress related pathways, could be the major contributors to the sperm cell transcriptome. since  <dig> of the tpa expressed genes have not been previously reported to be expressed in vegetative tissues and throughout the stages of seed development, they could serve as a useful resource to mine putative sperm cell transcripts for validation of their function in this unique cell type.

CONCLUSIONS
implications in defining components of biochemical and gene regulatory networks
identification of co-expressing clusters in a developmental event is indicative of common or related regulatory pathways. co-expression is often related to co-regulation, and genes that follow similar expression profiles may be the targets of the same transcription factors. our studies have allowed identification of specifically regulated genes. comparison with four of the vegetative stages and five seed development stages of rice has allowed segregation of transcripts dedicated to anther development function, especially the three co-expression groups that identify genes showing expression peaks in the four stages of anthers . many of the genes in these clusters have not yet been annotated and as such, deserve further attention as a source of genes that could have  unidentified roles in meiosis and other stages examined. such analysis is of great significance for future research, with several candidates now being targeted for studies that will build towards our understanding of regulatory networks and validating gene function.
