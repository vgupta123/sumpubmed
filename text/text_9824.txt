BACKGROUND
wild species usually exhibit large genetic variability, which serves as a resource for adaptability to changing environments. on the contrary, cultivated plants are usually more limited in number and display less genetic variability, as a result of the genetic bottlenecks occurring at domestication, translocation and transition from landraces to modern breeding  <cit> . a consequence of such genetic erosion is genetic uniformity, which may result in the loss of relevant traits, such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

thus, wild species related to cultivated crops represent interesting sources of genetic variation, through the introgression of new and better performing alleles. the large genetic variability present in the wild cereals is an invaluable resource for cereal crop improvement. hordeum chilense roemer et schultes, a native south american diploid wild barley , offers a high potential for cereal breeding among the species of the genus hordeum, because of its high crossability with other members of the triticeae tribe and its agronomically interesting characteristics. crosses between wheat and h. chilense lead to fertile amphiploids named tritordeums. they represent the basic genetic material for introducing genetic variability from h. chilense into wheat breeding programs  <cit>  and for transferring useful genes from h. chilense to wheat. the analysis of the germplasm genetic structure is the basis of management, research and utilization of such germplasm  <cit> , since it is critical to identify and correctly interpret the associations between functional and molecular diversity  <cit> . h. chilense has been found in a wide range of environments, and shows high genetic as well as phenotypic diversity  <cit> . the analysis of the structure of such high variations is important for breeding purposes, especially to identify genes or genomic regions involved in environmental adaptation and showing high diversity. the genetic structure of populations has been widely documented in most of the studies investigating the diversity of elite crop germplasm, especially in self-pollinating cereals  <cit> . molecular markers and development of statistical techniques to analyze such data have been the subject of recent intensive studies  <cit> , allowing the analysis of the genetic structure in several species and eliminating many of the problems linked with spurious associations. however, although significant efforts to increase the availability of genomic tools, such as molecular markers for cereal crops, have been undertaken in the last years, these developments were not made for wild species with scarce direct agronomic interest, like h. chilense. to solve this problem, the transferability of wheat and barley microsatellite markers  to wild related species was evaluated  <cit> . comparative genomic analyses have indicated a good conservation of coding regions across genomes of different grass species, suggesting that this part of the genome can be used to develop transferable molecular markers  <cit> . the development of high throughput sequencing technologies in recent years has allowed the generation of large expressed sequence tag  datasets in a number of plant species, including cereals, which can be systematically searched for ssr  <cit> . for example, yu et al.  <cit>  tested est-ssr primers originating from hexaploid wheat and rice ests on four cereal crops  and found that 62% of the primer pairs produced polymerase chain reaction  amplicons on at least two species. similarly, zhang et al.  <cit>  reported the transferability of  <dig> wheat est-ssrs on  <dig> accessions, representing  <dig> grass species. the transferability among the triticeae ranged from  <dig> % for aegilops longissima to 100% for wheat subspecies , but was also good for less related species such as rye  or maize . in barley, varshney et al.  <cit>  reported that  <dig> % of the ssr markers used  showed amplification in wheat, followed by  <dig> % in rye and  <dig> % in rice. finally, gupta et al.  <cit>  reported that  <dig> % of wheat est-ssrs were transferable to barley. recently, it was shown that the barley est-ssrs represent a promising source of molecular markers to screen the h. chilense genome  <cit> .

in addition of their high degree of transferability across species, it was recently demonstrated that est-ssrs are useful for genetic variability studies. for example, gupta et al.  <cit>  assessed the genetic diversity of est-ssrs in a collection of  <dig> elite exotic wheat genotypes. their results indicate that est-ssrs are more useful for diversity analyses than genomic microsatellites . yang et al.  <cit>  also used est-ssrs to measure the genetic diversity among three hexaploid wheat populations. they concluded that est-ssr markers are ideal markers for assessing genetic diversity in wheat. in addition, balfourier et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> g-ssrs or  <dig> est-ssrs to analyze the structure and the diversity of a collection of  <dig> wheat varieties and obtained identical results with both types of markers. recently, hübner et al.  <cit>  studied the genetic analysis of a new collection of the wild barley h. spontaneum with a set of  <dig> est-ssrs, revealing that wild barley populations can be divided into seven major genetically differentiated clusters, as well as the evidence of temperature and precipitation as environmental cues that have shaped the genetic makeup of wild barley. pan et al.  <cit>  investigated the genetic diversity among  <dig> wild emmer wheat  populations using  <dig> est-ssrs, detecting a considerable amount of genetic variation, partly related to ecological factors.

the goals of the current study were to determine:  the transferability level of wheat est-ssr markers and their usefulness for h. chilense;  the genetic diversity of the h. chilense species, using a wide set of available microsatellite markers;  the genetic structure of a natural collection of  <dig> h. chilense accessions; and  the possible influence of spatial, morphological and environmental factors in the observed structure.

RESULTS
transferability and polymorphism of wheat est-ssrs
the transferability of the  <dig> wheat est-ssrs was evaluated on a set of eight accessions of h. chilense. a ssr was considered as transferable when the pcr amplification of a band of the expected size and ssr pattern was observed. the primers that showed null alleles in some samples were tested at least twice, in order to avoid false negatives .

among the  <dig> wheat est-ssrs,  <dig>  showed cross-species transferability. the percentage of transferred markers was about 50% on each chromosome, thereby indicating a uniform distribution across the genome. among the  <dig> transferable ssrs,  <dig> pcr primer pairs  showed polymorphism in the accessions studied and were used for further analysis in the h. chilense germplasm. between two and  <dig> alleles per primer pair were observed and only  <dig> % of the total alleles had the same size as the allele found in triticum aestivum cv. 'chinese spring', confirming the good potential of h. chilense for wheat and barley genetic diversity improvement. these markers were first assigned to h. chilense chromosomes using the available set of wheat-h. chilense addition lines . fifteen of the  <dig> polymorphic primer pairs were located on the same linkage group as in wheat. one of them was located on chromosome  <dig> d in wheat , while it amplified a product on chromosome 1hch in h. chilense. four markers showed the same pcr amplicon sizes in both species, and thus their locations could not be confirmed.

genetic variability analysis
to perform the genetic variability analysis,  <dig> barley est-ssrs and  <dig> gssrs previously identified as useful for the genetic analysis in h. chilense  were added to the  <dig> polymorphic wheat est-ssrs transferred in this work. a total of  <dig> alleles were detected over the whole sample of  <dig> accessions for the  <dig> ssr loci. among the  <dig> alleles,  <dig> originated from the  <dig> barley est-ssrs,  <dig> from the  <dig> wheat est-ssrs and  <dig> from the eight g-ssrs. the number of alleles per locus ranged from two  to  <dig> , with a mean of  <dig>  alleles and polymorphic information content  of  <dig>  per locus . the highest  and lowest  pic values were observed for gbm <dig> and gpw <dig>  respectively. generally, wheat est-ssrs exhibited lower pic values and fewer number of alleles than barley est-ssrs. barley est-ssrs detected almost twice more alleles and higher pic values than wheat est-ssrs.

additionally, several rare or specific alleles were found among the analyzed germplasm. out of the  <dig> alleles,  <dig> were found at a frequency lower than 5%, and were therefore considered as rare. clustering showed that the germplasm can be separated into two groups  with a total of  <dig> specific alleles found in group i  and  <dig> specific alleles found in group ii . the gene diversity, polymorphic information content , and the number of specific alleles was lower in group i than in group ii .

analysis of genetic structure and differentiation among inferred groups
the genotyping data obtained from the  <dig> ssrs were used to analyze the genetic structure of the germplasm, using the bayesian clustering model implemented in the structure software. the natural logarithm of the probability of the data, proportional to the posterior probability of k, showed no clear peak between  <dig> and  <dig> for k, and therefore it was difficult to determine the true number of populations  . we applied the rate of change in the napierian logarithm probability relative to standard deviation , as described by evanno et al.  <cit> . the results showed the highest peak at  <dig> , which was confirmed by the clusteredness index  <cit> , showing the highest median level at k =  <dig> . moreover, using the geneland software, we observed that the posterior distributions of the estimated number of populations  across  <dig> replicates displayed a clear mode at k =  <dig> in all of them , corroborating again the previous data. thus, these results suggest that the analyzed h. chilense germplasm can be divided into two genetically distinct groups.

to find the key determinants to the inferred structure of these two groups, we investigated the geographical proximity, as well as the morphological, agronomical and ecological characteristics in the accessions belonging to each group. figure 2a shows the distribution of each accession into the two populations  and the three clusters . geographic origins divided in  <dig> zones  and ecological regions  according to the classification established by dicastri and hajek  <cit>  at k =  <dig> populations, are also shown.

the genetic structure analysis, according to the geographical origins of the accessions  revealed that, in some regions, the accessions were grouped according to the geographical location. the zones  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed a uniform structure, while the rest of the zones were more or less admixed. uniform structure was considered when more than 80% of the accessions in one group had more than 80% of membership in this group. the geographical origin of the accessions and their membership to the inferred groups are represented in figure  <dig>  we calculated the correlation coefficient  between the geographic and the genetic distance matrices using the mantel test  <cit> . we observed an r value of  <dig>  , revealing a low but significant correlation . the correlation was then analyzed separately for both inferred groups , and the results showed that group i had a uniform distribution in the center of the country, yet group ii expanded across the north, center and south of the country. therefore, group ii was analyzed separately for the north, the center and the south regions. we found a significant correlation between geographical proximity and genetic distance for group i and for group ii central. thus, our results demonstrate a geographical influence in population structure in the central chilean region for both structure groups . such influence was not detected for the group ii accessions, either at the north or south regions .

to investigate the impact of ecological characteristics in the inferred structure , the accessions were grouped according to bioclimatic parameters. the results revealed admixed populations, except for some provinces that showed a more uniform structure . comparative analyses between ecogeographical data  and genetic data  revealed a weak but significant correlation  . when analyzing the influence of the same ecogeographical data in both structured groups separately, the group i did not show any ecogeographical influence, whereas the group ii central exhibited a significant ecogeographical influence . in addition, the ecogeographical data were used to separate the h. chilense accessions through principal component  analysis. the first component  was explained by variation in latitude and rainfall, accounting for  <dig> % of the variation. the second component  accounted for  <dig> % of the variation, being explained by variation in temperature and longitude. pc <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of the variation, and was explained by the variation in elevation.

the unrooted neighbor-joining  tree  distinguished two groups of accessions, corresponding to the structure grouping. neither geographical nor ecological evidence was detected in the grouping. results of distance and bayesian cluster analyses evidenced the presence of a structured genetic diversity among the groups. the analysis of molecular variance  of the two inferred groups by the structure software revealed a  <dig> % of the genetic variation among groups, with the remaining  <dig> % due to differences within groups. the genetic variances within and among groups were significant , supporting the presence of a genetic structure.

association between markers and ecogeographical factors
we identified  <dig> outlier loci that detected high or low variability with respect to the expected neutrality. among those,  <dig> loci  are candidates for balanced selection, while the locus cfe <dig> is a candidate for being subjected to positive selection. the  <dig> markers were assayed for their association with ecogeographical data. the marker gwm <dig> exhibited four different alleles  among  <dig> alleles that were associated with low rainfall . the other markers did not show any significant association with any of the ecogeographical traits.

discussion
transferability and polymorphism of wheat est-ssr
the transferability of est-ssrs across related species has been demonstrated in several species and genera  <cit> . recently, we reported on the usefulness of barley est-ssrs for genetic analysis in h. chilense  <cit> . in the present work, we show that more than half  of the assayed wheat est-ssrs can be transferred to h. chilense, which is lower than the transferability of the barley est-ssrs . this is likely due to the fact that wheat is evolutively more distant from h. chilense than barley. this result is relatively consistent with the findings of zhang et al.  <cit>  and gupta et al.  <cit> , who reported higher transferability of wheat est-ssrs to barley than to more evolutively distant species, such as maize, rice, sorghum, lolium , oats and purple false brome .

despite of the evolutive distance, the overall conservation of the wheat est-ssrs linkage groups in h. chilense was high, indicating a good level of synteny between these two species. only one disagreement was observed, that may be due to chromosomal rearrangements, which may be frequent during speciation  <cit> . thus, the wheat est-ssrs markers transferred to h. chilense have an added value as intergeneric syntenic markers, in addition to their direct application to analyze gene diversity. since numerous additional wheat est-ssrs are available in the public databases , this number could be further increased.

among the  <dig> wheat est-ssrs showing good transferability to h. chilense, about 40% exhibited polymorphism between at least two accessions, which represents 20% of the initial set of wheat est-ssrs. this was lower compared to what was previously observed between wheat and barley . this is also lower compared to what was found using barley est-ssrs , because barley is more closely related to h. chilense than wheat. thus, the markers transferred from wheat to h. chilense are only those that are more conserved, and therefore likely to show lower polymorphism. similarly, the number of alleles detected in h. chilense with wheat est-ssrs was lower compared to the number obtained when using barley est-ssrs . on the other hand, due to their wheat origin, they are not suitable for direct in-tube detection methods  <cit> . nevertheless these drawbacks are largely overcome by the fact that they provide valuable anchors for synteny inference  <cit> . therefore, we conclude that both wheat and barley represent a good source of markers for genetic diversity and structure studies of h. chilense germplasm collections. in addition, they represent an invaluable tool for the introgression of h. chilense alleles to other cereal species.

genetic variability analysis
the microsatellite markers revealed a total of  <dig> alleles across all the  <dig> loci. the high level of genetic diversity detected could be an adaptive strategy in response to a heterogeneous environment. according to the marker's origin, the ssrs identified in est databases detected a lower number of alleles and pic than those obtained through general genomic libraries, including non-transcribed regions. such is an expected result, due to the more conserved nature of est-ssrs. the number of alleles detected and pic found when using est-ssrs from wheat was lower than with barley est-ssr and non-transcribed genomic microsatellites, as expected, due to the evolutionary distance between species. despite these facts, our results show a sufficient level of variation when using est-ssrs  to carry out genetic structure and future association mapping analysis. therefore, this is one more case where the est-ssr markers provide an opportunity to examine the functional diversity of germplasm collections, as shown by eujayl et al.  <dig>  <cit> .

the group i identified by structure was fixed to one allele in eight loci. seven of these loci could be assumed as being non-neutral, due to their origin from est databases. the higher number of fixed alleles in non-neutral ssrs could be explained by temporal variation of external factors, generating selection pressures that maintain variation within populations  <cit> . this may also be due to the fact that not all nucleotide bases on a transcribed dna are of selective nature. in fact, the third base of the mrna triplets is less specific . furthermore, some amino acids may share similar chemical properties , thus being less prone to generate a phenotypic change. a high number of specific alleles were identified, which could be an indication of the relatively high rate of mutation at ssr loci  <cit> , or to a germplasm with a rich genetic diversity and a divergent population structure. the gene diversity is significantly lower in group i than in group ii . therefore, the group ii is genetically more diverse, corresponding to accessions present in a wider ecogeographical range.

the spearman correlation showed that genetic diversity is influenced negatively by altitude and positively by temperature. accessions in group ii showed a higher number of alleles. besides, they were found mainly in places with low altitude and higher temperature than accessions in group i. therefore, accessions stressed by cold showed less genetic variation.

in this genetic variability analysis of h. chilense germplasm using wheat and barley gssrs and est-ssrs, we have defined two main germplasm groups . a previous analysis based on aflp markers and a principal-coordinate analysis  divided the same germplasm into three clusters. the group ii defined in this work contains two subgroups, corresponding to the clusters ii and iii described by vaz patto et al. .

genetic structure in h. chilense
the analysis of the genetic structure using both bayesian approaches  and genetic distance approaches  of a set of  <dig> h. chilense accessions, using  <dig> microsatellite markers, revealed two genetically differentiated groups.

the 'admixture model' implemented by structure gave a better fit to the species ecophysiological clusters, as defined by vaz patto et al.  <cit> , and it was chosen for further association analysis. therefore, the morphological and agronomic characteristics, which determined the ecophysiological clusters, were key determinants of the population structure of the h. chilense germplasm. thus, the two inferred groups are mainly in accordance with the agro-morphological clusters described by vaz patto et al.  <cit> , as the group i corresponds to cluster i, while the group ii  includes clusters ii and iii . according to the geographical origins and the ecological distribution, the inferred genetic structure showed both uniform and admixed populations . the accessions included in the geographical zones  <dig> and  <dig> showed a uniform genetic structure. they were found in the driest places of these zones, corresponding with mediterranean arid environments. the accessions grouped in the geographical regions  <dig> and  <dig> revealed also a uniform genetic structure, and were found in the wettest places, corresponding to and mediterranean humid and very humid environments. this points to an influence of the rainfall in shaping the population structure.

several studies have been carried out to detect the population structure in barley. in most of them, the key factors affecting the genetic structure were growth habit or spike morphology and geographic origin  <cit> . in our study, the morphological and agronomic characteristics also have appeared as the main factors to affect the population structure, although we have also shown that geographic locations and ecological patterns of distribution also affect this structure. the analysis of the total germplasm set revealed low but significant associations between geographical and genetic distance, as well as between ecological and genetic distance. by analyzing separately the three main geographical regions of provenance of the species , a more significant correlation between geographical and genetic distance was detected for the accessions from central chile, but no association was found either in northern or in southern chile accessions. this is in agreement with the basal phylogenetic position of h. chilense in south america, established initially in central chile from a long-distance continental dispersal from north america, followed by two independent dispersals to the north and to the south  <cit> . on the other hand, by analyzing both population structure groups separately, a higher correlation between ecological and genetic distance could be detected for group ii accessions, but no correlation was found for group i accessions. in fact, group ii accessions have shown a better ability to colonize the north and the south chilean regions . thus, the adaptation to geographic and ecological factors may be one of the causes of the genetic structure in the studied germplasm. thus, the results of our work illustrate the interest to further investigate how morphological characteristics and ecophysiological traits affect the species selection and the population structure. moreover, the presence of a high level of structure within the h. chilense germplasm should be considered in future association mapping studies. the amova detected higher differences among individuals within-population structure groups than among groups, which is consistent with findings from other studies, indicating that considerable genetic diversity is partitioned within rather than between wild barley populations  <cit> . the proportion of genetic variation within population groups reflected high levels of genetic diversity.

association of markers with ecogeographical factors
the loci that show unusually low or high levels of genetic differentiation are often assumed to be under natural selection  <cit> . the accessions that show association of alleles of the locus gwm <dig> with low precipitation belong mainly to the group i, and were collected from dry places, thereby suggesting that this environmental factor is involved in a local adaptation after colonization.

significant correlations between microsatellite markers and ecogeographical factors have been observed in several studies in wild wheat  <cit>  and in wild barley  <cit> , suggesting the impact of natural selection on these markers by creating regional divergence.

genetic clustering in a principal component analysis revealed that the combination of geographic and ecological data, such as the latitude with rainfall, as the main contributor to the genetic structure of the h. chilense germplasm. the second principal component explained by longitude and temperature significantly contributed to the separation of the two groups. hübner et al.  <cit>  studied the population structure in hordeum spontaneum and found a strong correlation of population structure with temperature and precipitation. in our study, the genetic structure of the analyzed germplasm showed a correlation with morphological and ecophysiological characteristics, influenced also to a minor extent by geographic and ecological factors.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows the utility of barley est-ssr for the genetic analysis of h. chilense, with a remarkably high level of polymorphism within this species, despite of the evolutionary distance between the wheat and barley genera. the current set of ssr markers available for hordeum chilense, which includes wheat and barley gssrs and est-ssrs, is useful to analyze the genetic structure and ecogeographical adaptation of h. chilense wild barley populations. both wheat and barley represent a good source of markers for genetic diversity and structure studies of h. chilense germplasm collections. in addition, they represent an invaluable tool for the introgression of h. chilense alleles into other cereal species, and are useful as anchors for the syntenic maps. the analyzed germplasm can be divided into two groups, with morphological and ecophysiological characteristics being key determinants of the population structure. geographic and ecological structuring was also revealed in the analyzed germplasm. a significant correlation between geographical and genetic distance was detected in the central chilean region for the first time in the species. in addition, significant ecological influence in genetic distance has been detected for one of the population structure groups  in the central chilean region. finally, one marker was found significantly associated with precipitation. these findings have a potential application in cereal breeding.
