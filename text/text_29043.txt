BACKGROUND
-hydrogenases catalyze the reversible activation of molecular hydrogen  <cit> . the genome of escherichia coli encodes four membrane-associated -hydrogenases, only three of which are synthesized under standard anaerobic growth conditions. two of these enzymes, hydrogenase  <dig>  and hyd- <dig>  oxidize hydrogen while the third, hyd- <dig>  is part of the hydrogen-evolving formate hydrogenlyase  complex  <cit> , which disproportionates formic acid into co <dig> and h <dig> and is an important means of preventing acidification of the cytoplasm during mixed-acid fermentation. while all three hyd enzymes are synthesized during fermentation hyd- <dig> appears to contribute the bulk  of the measureable hydrogenase activity  under these conditions, with hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> contributing the remainder  <cit> . moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that hyd- <dig> is functional in hydrogen oxidation at more reducing redox potentials while hyd- <dig> is optimally active at more oxidizing potentials and is less oxygen-sensitive than hyd- <dig>  <cit> . this presumably provides the bacterium with the capability of oxidizing hydrogen over a broad range of redox potentials.

the active site of the -hydrogenases comprises a ni atom and a fe atom to which the diatomic ligands co and cn- are attached  <cit> . the hyp proteins synthesize this hetero-bimetallic centre and mutations in the genes encoding these hyp maturases result in a hydrogenase-negative phenotype  <cit> . iron is also required as a key component of the  clusters in the respective electron-transferring small subunits of the hydrogenases  <cit> . in addition, iron is required for the function of at least one of the hyp maturases, hypd  <cit> .

while the route of nickel transport for hydrogenase biosynthesis in e. coli has been well characterized  <cit> , it has not been determined which of the characterized iron uptake systems is important for delivering iron to the hydrogenase maturation pathway. e. coli has a number of iron transport systems for the uptake of both ferric and ferrous iron  <cit> . under anaerobic, reducing conditions fe2+ is the predominant form of iron and it is transported by the specific ferrous-iron feoabc transport system  <cit> . under oxidizing conditions, where the highly insoluble fe3+ is the form that is available, e. coli synthesizes fe3+-specific siderophores to facilitate iron acquisition  <cit> . these fe3+-siderophore complexes are transported into the cell by specific transport systems, e.g. fe3+-citrate is transported by the fec system, fe3+-hydroxamate by the fhu system and fe3+-enterobactin by the fep system. in this study we examined the biosynthesis and activities of the -hydrogenases during fermentative growth in null mutants lacking defined iron transport systems.

RESULTS
a feob mutant has reduced hydrogenase activity in both minimal and rich medium
all three -hydrogenases in e. coli catalyze the hydrogen-dependent reduction of the artificial redox dye benzyl viologen   <cit> . this activity can be visualized in colonies on agar plates after anaerobic fermentative growth. the colonies of wild type cells develop a dark violet colour in the presence of hydrogen and bv, while mutants unable to synthesize hydrogenase remain colourless  <cit> . approximately  <dig> kanamycin-resistant tn5-insertion mutants were screened for an impaired ability to catalyze the hydrogen-dependent reduction of bv after anaerobic fermentative growth on m <dig> minimal medium plates with glucose as carbon source . one of eight putative mutants isolated had a pale violet colony colour after bv-overlay in the presence of hydrogen; the characterization of the remaining seven putative mutants will be described elsewhere. transduction of the mutation in the pale-violet mutant into a 'clean' mc <dig> genetic background resulted in the mutant pm <dig>  which retained the phenotype of the originally isolated mutant. sequence analysis of the site of tn <dig> insertion in the mutant revealed that it had inserted in the feob gene, which encodes the gtpase component of the ferrous iron transporter  <cit> .

the hydrogen-dependent reduction of bv was determined in extracts derived from mc <dig>  and pm <dig>  grown anaerobically in m <dig> minimal medium with glucose as carbon source and with different iron sources . the wild type mc <dig> grown without addition of iron compounds had a total hydrogenase activity of  <dig>  u mg of protein- <dig> . growth of mc <dig> in the presence of iron citrate and potassium ferricyanide had essentially no effect on enzyme activity, while ferric chloride resulted in an 80% increase and ferric ammonium sulfate a  <dig> -fold increase in total hydrogenase activity . growth of mc <dig> in the presence of potassium ferrocyanide  resulted in extracts with a reduced but still significant hydrogen-oxidizing activity of 66% compared to the wild type grown without addition. it was noted that due to the poor growth of the strains in minimal medium in the presence of ferricyanide and ferrocyanide the hydrogenase enzyme activity was highly variable with high sd values. this phenomenon was reproducibly observed, despite attempts to harvest cells under strictly comparable conditions of growth and presumably reflects variability in the labile hyd- <dig> activity . therefore, it must be stressed that only general trends in enzyme activity changes caused by these iron sources can be considered.

a cells were cultivated in m <dig> minimal medium including  <dig> %  glucose. iron sources were added at the given final concentrations.

b the activities were determined for triplicate experiments.

extracts of a hypf mutant, which cannot synthesize active hydrogenases  <cit> , had essentially no hydrogenase enzyme activity and served as a negative control. extracts of the feob::tn <dig> mutant pm <dig> grown in m <dig> medium in the absence of iron had a total hydrogenase activity that was 24% that of the wild type without addition of iron compounds . growth of pm <dig> in the presence of iron chloride or ferric ammonium sulfate restored hydrogenase activity to levels similar to wild type. the exception was potassium ferricyanide, which failed to restore hydrogenase enzyme activity to wild type levels; instead activity was approximately 50% of that measured in mc <dig> grown without iron supplementation and only 50% of that measured after growth of the wild type with potassium ferricyanide . in contrast, growth of pm <dig> in the presence of ferrocyanide did not restore hydrogenase activity. addition of hemin as a source of oxidized iron also failed to restore hydrogenase activity to pm <dig>  presumably because hemin cannot be taken up by e. coli and the oxidized iron is also tightly bound to the porphyrin. taken together, these results are consistent with the ferrous iron transport system being an important route of iron uptake for hydrogenase biosynthesis in the wild type.

addition of  <dig>  2'-dipyridyl to the growth medium resulted in total loss of hydrogenase activity of the wild type mc <dig> and pm <dig> . supplementation of  <dig> μm iron chloride or iron citrate together with  <dig> μm dipyridyl showed that iron citrate restored 66% of the wild type activity while iron chloride failed to restore activity. none of these additions restored hydrogenase activity to pm <dig> 

the activities of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> can be visualized after non-denaturing page followed by specific activity staining  <cit> ; hyd- <dig> is labile and cannot be visualized under these conditions. this method allows a specific analysis of the effect of mutations or medium supplements on hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> activity and it should be noted that this method is only semi-quantitative. analysis of the extracts of mc <dig> grown in minimal medium under all of the conditions tested identified both hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> as characteristic hydrogen-oxidizing activity-staining bands . the relative intensity of the activity-staining bands was quantified by densitometric analysis  as described in the methods section. the intensity of the hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> activity-staining bands was similar when cells were grown fermentatively in the presence of iron citrate, ferric ammonium sulfate, ferricyanide or ferrocyanide. in cell-free extracts derived from pm <dig> grown with the three fe3+ sources ferricyanide, ferric ammonium sulfate and ferric citrate the hyd- <dig> activity-staining profile was similar to that of the wild type, however, the intensity was reduced by approximately 50% . on the other hand, hyd- <dig> attained a level that was only between  <dig> and 20% the intensity of the wild type grown with iron citrate, suggesting that the activity of this enzyme is less readily complemented by addition of oxidized iron. somewhat surprising, however, was the observation that although some activity of hyd- <dig> could be observed after growth of the mutant in the presence of fecl <dig>  hyd- <dig> activity was strongly reduced . total hydrogenase enzyme activity measured in these extracts of pm <dig> was nevertheless near wild type . it must be noted, however, that under these growth conditions the contributions of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> to the total activity are low , as can be deduced from a strain lacking hyd- <dig>  that retained 4% of the wild type activity with iron chloride  <cit> . this means that although hyd- <dig> or hyd- <dig> activities could barely be observed by in-gel staining, the increase in total hydrogenase activity by addition of fecl <dig> was due to hyd- <dig> activity.

an extract derived from pm <dig> grown in the presence of ferrocyanide showed essentially no detectable activity due to either hyd- <dig> or hyd- <dig> , indicating that probably the level of iron in the mutant was insufficient to allow synthesis of wild type levels of these enzymes. this correlated with the low total hydrogenase activity measured in extracts of pm <dig> after fermentative growth with ferrocyanide, and indicates that the residual activity was due to hyd- <dig> . after growth of pm <dig> in the presence of hemin no hyd- <dig> activity was detected in the gel , and only a very low hyd- <dig> activity was detected. total hydrogenase activity was only 10% of the total compared to wild type without addition of iron compounds, indicating that hyd- <dig> activity was not recovered in pm <dig> by addition of hemin to the growth medium.

the effect of the feob mutation on hydrogenase enzyme activity could also be observed after growth in rich medium, whereby the hydrogenase enzyme activity of the feob mutant pm <dig> was reduced by a little over 50% compared with the activity of mc <dig> .

a cell extracts were prepared from cells grown anaerobically in tgyep plus formate.

b the mean and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments are shown.

in an attempt to complement the feob mutation, initially the feob gene was re-introduced into pm <dig> by transformation of plasmid pecd <dig> . the plasmid failed to restore hydrogenase enzyme activity to the levels determined for the wild type; surprisingly, the presence of the plasmid reduced overall hydrogenase activity to only about 15% that of the wild type . western blot analysis of the strep-tagged feob derivative encoded on pecd <dig> confirmed that the protein was synthesized but that the level of synthesis was higher in aerobically grown cells compared with anaerobically grown cells . the reason for the reduction in hydrogenase activity caused by over-produced strep-tagged feob is unclear.

introduction of the complete feoabc operon on the plasmid restored hydrogenase activity in pm <dig> to wild type levels . this latter result suggests that the transposon insertion in the feob gene caused a polar effect on the downstream feoc gene and only the presence of the complete operon on a plasmid could complement the mutation.

combined knock-out of ferrous and ferric iron transport systems abolishes hydrogen-oxidizing activities
single null mutations that prevented biosynthesis of ferric-enterobactin  or the uptake system for ferric-citrate  essentially had little to no effect on total hydrogenase activity . introducing a mutation in the fhua or fhue genes also had no effect on total hydrogenase activity . combining the entc and feca-e mutations  reduced hydrogenase activity by approximately 60% compared to the wild type. introducing the feob::tn <dig> mutation into this strain to deliver cp <dig>  reduced total hydrogenase activity even further such that only approximately 7% of the wild type level could be detected.

a cell extracts were prepared from cells grown anaerobically in tgyep plus  <dig> mm formate.

b the mean and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments are shown.

analysis of cell-free extracts derived from these strains grown fermentatively in rich medium by non-denaturing page, with subsequent staining for activity of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  revealed that, as anticipated, the extracts of cp <dig>  and cp <dig>  showed essentially wild-type hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> activity profiles . however, an extract from pm <dig>  showed clearly reduced intensity bands for both enzymes, which is in accord with the results after growth in minimal medium . extracts from cp <dig>  or cp <dig>  grown fermentatively in rich medium had neither hyd- <dig> nor hyd- <dig> enzyme activities. this result indicates that the residual hydrogenase enzyme activity in cp <dig> must result from hyd- <dig> . to test this, we determined the fhl enzyme activity present in whole cells of the various mutants  and could demonstrate that while cells of cp <dig>  had an fhl activity of approximately 50% of the wild-type, strain cp <dig>  still retained 30% of the wild-type fhl activity, confirming that the residual hydrogenase activity in extracts of cp <dig> was indeed due to hyd- <dig>

hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> large subunits are absent in cp <dig> 
in order to determine whether the lack of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> activity in the mutants devoid of ferrous and ferric uptake was due to lack of processing of the large subunits because of iron-limitation, the precursor and processed forms of the large subunits of hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> in cell-free extracts derived from the iron transport mutants after growth in rich medium were analysed by western blotting with enzyme-specific antisera. extracts derived from mc <dig>  revealed mainly the processed form of the catalytic subunit of all three enzymes , which is indicative of successful insertion of the -cofactor  <cit> . in contrast, a mutant unable to synthesize the hypf protein  is unable to generate the diatomic cn- ligands and consequently fails to insert the cofactor. extracts from a hypf mutant therefore only showed the unprocessed form of each catalytic subunit , which indicates that the large subunit lacks a cofactor  <cit> . extracts derived from cp <dig>  and cp <dig>  both showed levels of processed large subunits for hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> similar to those seen for the wild-type mc <dig> . densitometric analysis of the levels of these processed polypeptides in the autoradiogram shown in figure 3a, however, revealed that in extracts of cp <dig> and cp <dig> hyd- <dig> large subunit levels were only 20% and 50%, respectively, of that observed in the wild type, while in extracts of cp <dig> the level of hyd- <dig> large subunit hyce was almost 3-fold increased compared with the level in the wild type . extracts derived from the feca-e entc double null mutant cp <dig> showed the similar increased level of hyd- <dig> large subunit and decreased level of hyd- <dig> large subunit as was observed with cp416; however, the difference was that hyd- <dig> levels were decreased by approximately 40% compared with the wild type. these results suggest that under mild iron-limiting conditions, intracellular iron is preferentially used for hydrogen-evolving function. the feob mutant pm <dig> showed strongly reduced levels of processed hyd- <dig> large subunit and barely detectable levels of hyd- <dig> processed large subunit; the amount of processed hyd- <dig> large subunit was approximately 50% that of the wild-type. cell-free extracts of cp <dig>  and cp <dig> , on the other hand, essentially completely lacked either the unprocessed or processed forms of the large subunits of hyd- <dig> or hyd- <dig>  which correlates with the lack of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> enzyme activity observed in figure  <dig>  both the processed and unprocessed forms of the hyd- <dig> large subunit hyce were observed in extracts from both strains but at significantly reduced levels, which is in accord with the observed fhl activity measured in the strains . although the level of processed hyce in both strains was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type, the amounts of full-length, unprocessed polypeptide were similar to those seen in the wild-type , suggesting that there was a limitation in processing capacity in the mutants.

expression of the hya, hyb and hyc operons is only marginally reduced in the iron-transport mutants
the hya, hyb and hyc operons encode hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . to determine whether expression of these operons was affected in the different iron-transport-defective mutants, we constructed lacz translational fusions to the first gene of each operon, which encode the respective small subunits of the enzymes hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  while the hyca gene encodes a transcriptional regulator . after transfer to the lambda phage λrs <dig>  <cit> , the hyaa'-'lacz, hybo'-'lacz and hyca'-'lacz fusions were introduced in single copy onto the chromosome of the respective mutants. to demonstrate that the fusions were functional we analyzed expression levels after growth under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. expression of hyaa'-'lacz was strongly reduced when wild type cells were grown aerobically, while expression was up-regulated approximately 70- <dig> fold during fermentative growth . the hybo'-'lacz expression was shown to be approximately  <dig> fold higher in anaerobically grown compared with aerobically grown cells. expression of hyca'-'lacz was up-regulated  <dig> fold in the presence of formate. all fusions showed near background β-galactosidase enzyme activity when cells were grown aerobically  <cit> .

a in the interest of clarity only the genotype of the strains is given. the strains used can be found in table  <dig>  growth was performed under fermentative conditions in tgyep, unless indicated otherwise.

n. d.-not determined

the results in table  <dig> show that in entc or feob mutants, expression of hyaa was reduced by approximately 50% compared with the wild type mc <dig>  expression of hybo attained levels that were only approximately 10% those of hyaa , consistent with transcriptional regulation data for these operons reported earlier  <cit> . the expression of the hybo'-'lacz fusion was reduced by approximately 40% in a feob mutant background and by 35% in an entc mutant compared with the level of expression measured in the wild type . expression of the hyc operon remained comparatively constant among the strains, but was reduced by maximally 40% in a feca-e feob double mutant. a slight increase in hyc expression in the feob single mutant was observed; however, it should be noted that expression levels were variable in the mutant backgrounds. addition of dipyridyl to the growth medium had no effect on hyc expression .

discussion
in a previous study  <cit>  it was shown that hydrogen metabolism of e. coli was significantly affected by introduction of a fur mutation. fur is a global regulator controlling iron homeostasis  <cit> . differential effects on hydrogen-oxidizing hydrogenase activity compared with hydrogen-evolving enzyme function were observed previously in the fur mutant  <cit> . the fur mutation, which has both negative and positive effects on gene expression of iron metabolism including depression of iron uptake systems, caused a strong reduction in fhl activity, suggesting fur is required for fhl synthesis. in the current study we could show in an otherwise fur+ background that causing iron limitation by removing key iron uptake systems also resulted in differential effects on hydrogen uptake and hydrogen evolution: hydrogen-oxidizing hydrogenase function was compromised first while hydrogen-evolving hydrogenase activity was partially retained. during a search for genes affecting hydrogenase biosynthesis or activity, a mutant with a transposon insertion in feob encoding the gtpase component of the postulated ferrous iron transport system  <cit>  was isolated. the alteration in hydrogen metabolism caused by the mutation could not be phenotypically complemented by ferrous iron but could be complemented by supplementing the growth medium with oxidized iron. this result supports the important role of the feo system in transport of iron under reducing conditions. although this finding was perhaps not surprising considering that the hydrogenases are synthesized under anaerobic fermentative conditions when fe2+ ions are available and the feo transport system is active  <cit> , it was nevertheless important to demonstrate the involvement and importance of this route of iron acquisition for enzymes that have a high demand for iron atoms.

combining the feob mutation with a mutation in entc, which impairs biosynthesis of the siderophore enterobactin, abrogated hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> activities. notably, however, significant hyd- <dig>  and consequently fhl, activity was retained in the double null mutant, suggesting that when iron is limited during fermentative growth the synthesis of the hydrogen-evolving hyd- <dig> takes precedence over the two hydrogen-oxidizing enzymes hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  the fact that hyd- <dig> is maximally active under more reducing conditions, while hyd- <dig> is an oxygen-tolerant enzyme and is active at more positive redox potentials  <cit> , did not influence this preference. even when a further mutation preventing synthesis of the iron-citrate transport system was introduced, residual hyd- <dig> and fhl activities were retained. indeed, previous studies demonstrated that only when zupt and mnth mutations were also introduced into this background was fhl activity abolished  <cit> . this suggests that the fhl system can scavenge residual iron entering the cell through unspecific transport systems, but that these levels of iron either are insufficient for synthesis of hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> or that the iron is directed preferentially to hyd- <dig> biosynthesis. further studies will be required to elucidate which of these possibilities is correct.

a somewhat unexpected result of this study was the finding that under iron limitation no unprocessed species of the hyd- <dig> or hyd- <dig> large subunits were present and only very low amounts of the processed proteins were observed. this was unexpected because in hyp mutants, where active site biosynthesis cannot be completed  <cit> , significant levels of the unprocessed form of the large subunit are always detected . the fact that expression of translational lacz fusions of the hya and hyb structural gene operons was largely unaffected by the deficiency in iron transport suggests that a different level of regulation in response to iron availability exists. this regulation might possibly be post-translational, for example through altered protein turnover due to insufficient iron.

CONCLUSIONS
mutants unable to acquire iron through the ferrous iron transport and siderophore-based uptake systems lacked the hydrogen-oxidizing enzymes hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> under anaerobic fermentative conditions. iron limitation did not affect transcription of the hya, hyb or hyc operons. the hyd- <dig> component of the fhl complex was less severely affected by defects in these iron uptake systems, indicating that a greater degree of redundancy in iron acquisition for this enzyme exists. thus, when iron becomes limiting during fermentative growth synthesis of active hyd- <dig> has priority over that of the hydrogen-oxidizing enzymes hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  this probably reflects a physiological requirement to maintain an active fhl complex to offset acidification of the cytoplasm caused by formate accumulation via disproportionation of the metabolite into the freely diffusible gaseous products co <dig> and h <dig>
